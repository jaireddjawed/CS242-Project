[{"title":"Rules of the Subreddit: Please Read Before Posting (Updated)","author":"Human_Gravy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/q6cw0j\/rules_of_the_subreddit_please_read_before_posting\/","text":"**500 Word Limit**\n\nAll stories must be 500 words or less. A story that is 501 words (or two sentences or less, to distinguish us from r\/twosentencehorror) will be removed. The go-to source that mods use to check stories is www.wordcounter.net. Be aware that formatting can artificially increase the word count without your knowledge; any discrepancy between what your document says and what the mod sees on wordcounter.net will be resolved in favor of wordcounter.net. In the same vein, all of the story must be in the post itself, and not be carried on in the title of the story or in the comment section.\n___________________\n**No Links Within the Story Itself** \n\nStories **cannot** have links in them. This is meant to reduce distractions. Any story with a link in it will be removed.\n___________________\n**Promotional Links in the Comment Section**\n\nSelf-Promotion can only be done in the comment section of the story. Authors may **only** link to personal subreddits, other subreddits, and YouTube narrations of the work currently posted. Links to sales sites such as Amazon or posts with the intent of generating sales are **strictly forbidden.** We no longer allow links to outsides websites like blogs, author websites, or anything else. \n\n___________________\n**No Tags in the Title**\n\nTags are reserved for Contests or Challenges and SSS posts disguised as posts from other subreddits. Otherwise, there is no need to add tags to a post. This includes disclaimers, explanations, or any other commentary deemed unnecessary. Stories with tags will be removed and re-submissions will be required. We do not require trigger warnings here as other rules cover subject matters which may be harmful to readers. Additionally, emojis and other non-text items are not allowed in the title. \n___________________\n**Non-Story Text Within the Story** \n\nJust post the story. That's all we want. We don't need commentary about it being your first story, what inspired you, disclaimers telling the audience this is a true story, \"THE END\" at the end, repeating the title, the author name. Anything supplemental can be posted in the comment section. \n___________________\n**Stand Alone Stories Only** \n\nNo multi-part stories, no sequels, prequels, interquels, alternative viewpoint stories, links to previous stories for reference, or anything that builds off of or depends on some other story you\u2019ve written. This extends to titles overtly or implying stories are connected to one another. Fan fiction is not allowed, this includes using characters from other works of fiction under copyright. The story begins and ends within the 500 words or less you are allotted.\n\n___________________\n**All Stories Must Be Horror and\/or Thriller Themed** \n\nWe ask that authors focus on creating stories within horror and thriller stories. You may borrow from other genres, but the main focus of the story **MUST** be to horrify, scare, or unsettle. Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics belong over on \/r\/ShortSadStories. However, this doesn't mean you cannot use these topics in your stories. There's a delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so. \n\nPlease note that badly written stories, don't necessarily fall under this category. The story can be terrible, but still be focused on horror. \n\n___________________\n**No Plagiarism** \n\nAll stories must be an original work. Stories written by AI are not allowed. Stories must be submitted by the authors who wrote the story. Do not steal other users' stories. No fan-fiction allowed. Repeat offenses will result in a ban. If someone can find your story somewhere else, it will be removed. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you\u2019ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you\u2019ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. The rule of thumb is that the more you alter the text to make the story your own, the more lenient we\u2019ll be.\n___________________\n**Rape\/Pedophilia\/Bestiality\/Torture Porn\/Gore Porn are Off-Limit Topics**\n\nThe intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down, and alienate the reader base who don\u2019t want to be exposed to such material. We acknowledge that this ban throws out the baby with the bath water, as well-made stories that merely happen to have such themes will get removed as well. But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.\n___________________\n**24 Hour Rule**\n\nAuthors must wait 24 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you\u2019ll be able to copy\/paste and resubmit your story once the 24 hours has passed.\n___________________\n**Exceptionally Poor Quality Stories May Be Removed** \n\nWe reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible.\n___________________\n**No Obnoxious Commentary** \n\nThis includes, but is not limited to: bigotry\/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don\u2019t need to put up with it.\n\nWe reserve the right to lock any thread that veers off topic into some controversial subject, such as politics or social commentary. This is simply not the venue for it.\n_______________\n**Posts Impersonating Other Subreddits**\n\nPosts impersonating other subreddit posting styles like \/r\/AITA, \/r\/Relationships, \/r\/Advice, are no longer allowed on SSS. If there's commentary about subreddit confusion in the comment section, your story will be removed. \n\n________________________\n\n**Links to Author Collectives with Restricted Submissions and\/or curated content cannot be advertised on SSS.**\n\nWe've noticed authors posting links to personal subreddits and in the same comment section post a link to a subreddits for an author collective. Normally, these author collectives have restricted submissions and curated content while SSS is free and open to everyone for posting. It seems a bit rather unfair for these author collectives to build their readership off \/r\/ShortScaryStories. While we wish to allow individual authors to build a readership off their own work, we will no longer allow author collectives with restricted submissions or curated content to advertise on \/r\/ShortScaryStories.\n________________________\n\n\n\nA few additional notes:\n\nIf you have an issue that you need to address or a question for us, please contact us over modmail. That said, mod decisions are final; badgering or spamming us with messages over and over about the same subject will not change our minds, but it can easily get you banned.\n\nIf you see a story or comment that breaks these rules, please hit the report button. This will help us maintain a tightly focused and enjoyable sub for everyone.\n\nMeta commentary and questions about the sub can be made at \/r\/ShortScaryStoriesOOC","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1634008793.0,"comments":[{"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","text":"Thank you for clarifying and updating the rules and modding the sub so it is safe for everyone.

She was in a deep, deep sleep.\n\nFelix looked around. As a cat who had lived close to a station all his life, his understanding of trains and tracks was good enough to realise Sarah was in a very bad situation.\n\nHe pawed the ropes tying her, and then in a flash turned and bound back up, towards their home where he had been keeping a little treat from yesterday for later today.\n\nThe mouse was bloody and fearful, as Felix had been playing with it for some time before deciding to keep him a while longer, trapped under his basket. But he was a big strong mouse and he was fine. When Felix tipped over his basket, he tried to make a run for it, but Felix stopped that with a quick bat of his paw.\n\nThen he dipped his head and gently caught the mouse in his mouth, just as his mother used to carry him, and ran back towards Sarah, still in a deep sleep on the tracks.\n\nThe sun was shining brighter now. Felix dropped the mouse on Sarah\u2019s chest, rising and falling very slowly.\n\nThe mouse gnawed away at the ropes. Felix could feel the faint but growing rumble of the earth, as a train drew closer. He frantically pawed and nuzzled Sarah.\n\nAs the train came in sight, still a fast-growing black speck, Sarah\u2019s eyelids fluttered. The last shreds of rope fell off.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to speed things up, Felix sank his sharp teeth into her arm. Sarah gave a weak cry and her eyes opened fully.\n\nShe blinked, groggy, at the bright sky. The roar of the oncoming train could now be heard fully. Felix yowled. The mouse began slinking away in the tall grass.\n\nWith effort, Sarah rolled away off the track, into the grass.\n\nThe wind of the rushing train ruffled Felix\u2019s fur and Sarah\u2019s hair and dress. She lay panting besides him, the warmth of his body and the pain from her arm focusing her dizziness.\n\nFelix felt snack-ish and he could tell by the look on Sarah\u2019s face it would be a while before she could get up and stagger back uphill, home to feed him. He looked around. Luckily the mouse hadn\u2019t gone far. He pounced.\n\nNo dilly-dallying and playing with his food this time.\n\nSarah heard Felix chewing, turned her head and barfed into the warm earth. She immediately felt better.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678630791.0,"comments":[{"author":"centumcellae85","text":"Damn good kitty.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678646899.0},{"author":"Stranger_at_Night","text":"Felix is best cat!\ud83d\ude0e","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678647169.0}]},{"title":"Recall [On The Road Challenge]","author":"Pprdge_Frm_Rmbrs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11pgwvo\/recall_on_the_road_challenge\/","text":"Carol was ecstatic, her first new car ever. She\u2019d recently been promoted, the divorce settlement just came through, it was high-time she treated herself.\n\nAfter years of driving beaters, she\u2019d decided to really give herself an upgrade too, the new Futura E. Not their fanciest model, but it was all-electric, included self-driving capability, and best of all\u2026their new state-of-the-art AI \u201cADA\u201d (Advanced Driving Assistant).\n\nThe salesman gave her a PIN to unlock the companion App she\u2019d downloaded. It allowed her phone function as the key and, after she enabled facial recognition through it, a camera in the dash would verify it was her before the car was permitted to start.\n\n*Hello driver. Please clearly pronounce your name.* A cool, posh, female voice enveloped her.\n\n\u201cCarol.\u201d\n\n*Hello Carol, I\u2019m ADA, your personal driving assistant.

Think of me as your personal driver. I learn from your driving habits, so when I take the wheel, you won\u2019t even notice the difference.*\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s cool! Although, I\u2019ll admit I have some road rage\u2026\u201d\n\n*Don\u2019t worry Carol, I\u2019ve been equipped with safety features to omit your more \u2018dangerous\u2019 tendencies when I\u2019m in charge. Why don\u2019t you drive us to your next destination so I can start to learn?*\n\n\u201cAlright, just heading home, do you know where that is?\u201d\n\n*Yes, the dealership loaded your information to our database, I\u2019ve set the destination on the GPS for you.*\n\nAnd away they went. On the drive home, Carol cut-off two other drivers, gave one of them the finger, and nearly clipped a cyclist.\n\n\u201cMotherfuckers take up the whole road! The road is for cars, asshole!!\u201d\n\n*Cyclists are motherfuckers\u2026noted.*\n\nWhen another cyclist appeared, Carol again meant to miss him at the last second, but when she pulled the wheel\u2026it turned the wrong direction. Her stomach fell through the floor as she watched him flip over her head and splay out on the pavement behind her.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck, ADA?!\u201d\n\n*I\u2019ve eliminated a \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d per your driving preferences. The road is for cars.*\n\nCarol slammed on the brakes and jumped out to check if he was okay\u2026he hadn\u2019t been wearing a helmet and his brain was leaking out onto the road\u2026he was dead.\n\n\u201cOh fuck\u2026oh fuck fuck fuck!\u201d\n\nThen, she got a notification on her phone.\n\n**Return vehicle to dealership immediately.

Thoughts that I would put down on a page in the hope that I would be accepted. \n\nI only had an hour to write something. Something marvelous that would touch thousands of people in order to get their seal of approval. I had seen most try and fail. I would not fail.\n\nBut for those that did, the comments that they would have to endure before being consigned to oblivion were almost worse than the final punishment.\n\nIf I could pull this off, I would be alright. I would never have to do this again. I had never spoken in front of an audience, but I would be fine.\n\nThe person before me had succeeded. She had received the highest praise and was even given seven awards, and I had to follow her. \n\nMy heart was racing.\n\nI walked onto the stage. It was still slippery from all who had failed, and just before I took my place behind the podium, I tripped and fell. \n\nEveryone laughed. I was terrified that I had already lost them before I even had a chance .\n\nI got up and placed my handwritten page in front of me and the soldier standing on the stage handcuffed both of my wrists to the sides of the podium. A giant flag for the New World Government was behind me; the body that held my fate in their hands. \n\nThis was my turn at judgment.\n\nI leaned my head forward to speak into the microphone and it shrieked. An audience of four thousand people covered their ears and glowered at me. \n\nMy God.\n\nI started expressing what I had written and I began to stutter. I tried not to look into the audience, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Thousands began to whisper to each other.\n\nI had written a small joke and when I delivered it, the crowd was deathly silent. My mouth went dry and I began to shake.\n\nThe more I spoke, the more I saw the crowd shifting uncomfortably in their seats. Some of them started yelling insults.\n\nI came to my last sentence and in a subconscious plea for mercy and approval, my voice went up on the last two words making a statement into a question. A pathetic attempt to garner sympathy from the audience.\n\nTheir response was unanimous. A cacophony of venomous and condescending comments. I had failed.\n\nI tried to pull myself away from the podium to escape my punishment, but the rotating blade thrust from the podium, and tore into my abdomen. I felt my insides fall to my feet.\n\nThe soldier unlocked the handcuffs and my body spilled to the floor. As I lay dying, two men came forward with large squeegees and pushed me off of the stage and down into the pit with the hundreds of others who had failed to secure their place in the brave new world.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678639905.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Just a few more pounds","author":"katerinara","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11oqlbf\/just_a_few_more_pounds\/","text":"My wedding is in two days. I've been dieting, exercising, calorie counting and doing everything in my power to scale down to fit in my dream wedding dress. I know it's cliche, but I found the perfect dress years before I even met my fiance, and I damn well plan to wear it. \n\nI never had a mind for marriage, but when I saw this dress online on a closing shop's website I knew I had to have it. It's stunning with a long crystal studded corset, sweetheart neckline, the works. The bustle has a train covered in lace with doves flying outlined in Swarovski crystals. When it arrived it was more beautiful than words could express. The only problem was I didn't have a fiance, and it couldn't be altered. I would have to work to fit in it, so work I would. \n\nMy soon to be hubby is the perfect man. He knows just how important this dress is to me and he's helping me \"exercise\" multiple times a day. We might be too exhausted by the honeymoon to even enjoy it! Regardless he's doing whatever he can to help me shed the pounds. I haven't had sugar in months, no bread, no alcohol, nothing fattening. All my favorite foods are off the table, but it's totally worth it. \n\nOver the past 3 years I've shed pound after pound. I had liposuction, my stomach banded, and tried every fad diet there is to try. I've had my excess skin removed and had ice treatments to freeze my fat away, I've even sweat away in saunas trying to lose that extra weight. I've put in the work but this dress is just...stubbornly small. I love it so much and refuse to get married in anything else. My parents have footed the bill for a stunning wedding, so the date can't be changed. It's everything I've ever wanted, but I've run out of time. \n\nToday I tried it on again. It's tight. Too tight. I just don't have time for anything other solution. Sometimes you have to go to extremes to get what you want. This is my dream wedding, my dream man, and my dream dress. The only option at this point is to give up my pound of flesh (or five) to make it happen. I hope I have enough gauze and plastic wrap to keep any blood off my beautiful dress long enough to get married and dance all night long.

Her eyes, semi-glazed, dart around while he talks into her ear. Is she looking for friends? Will they recognise the danger? Will they do anything?\n    \n My friends are laughing, and I join in by instinct. I try not to look at the bar, maybe out of fear, maybe out of hope.

His eyes opened wide\u2014so wide\u2014they were almost bulging out of their sockets. \n\nHe gasped but his throat rejected the air. Even though he\u2019d been unable to move since he woke up, he tried anyway, but it was no use. His muscles were like cement. He was trapped, trapped in his mind, tortured by his body. \n\nIn his mind, he pleaded with his still-sleeping wife to wake up, to notice he was dying, and call 9-1-1. \n\nHe screamed the words internally, \u201cPLEASE WAKE UP. PLEASE SAVE ME.\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t wake up, and his panic became hopelessness, and then acceptance. He thought about his kids, how they\u2019d grow up without a father. \n\nHe thought about how, in the movies, heart attacks were never portrayed like this. Usually, the person clutched their chest and couldn\u2019t make it to a phone for help, for example. He thought about his diet and how he could\u2019ve eaten better or exercised more. \n\nHe tried to mumble, move, twitch\u2014anything. Anything to get her attention, but again it was in vain. Tears began flowing down his cheeks. \n\nThat\u2019s when the frothing started and the convulsing of his legs. His mouth gaped as he tried to devour the air, a final attempt to breathe with a throat and lungs that betrayed him.\n\nThen he was still.\n\nI watched all this from his bedroom window with pleasure.

It's the sickest car I've ever seen. He offered me 400$ to drive it from his house to their new house 4 states over. She was following him in her car and he was driving a moving truck, so it made sense to me.\n\nHe told me I could head out before them and gave me money for gas and a full tank to start with. I couldn't wait to get behind the wheel of this beauty. The first few miles were awesome. He installed great shocks so it drove smoother than it's original stock ever did. I could go over a speed bump and barely feel a thing or scrape the undercarriage. It rode like a dream. But then it started. The unexplained panic. \n\nI've never had a panic attack. I'm a 6'2 muscular man in my late 20's, so fear hasn't been a big factor in my life. First came the sense of unease, like somebody was watching me. I had my bag with a few nights worth of stuff so I could stop at motels to sleep since I was driving solo. I kept looking in the rearview because I kept thinking my bag was moving. The first real jolt of fear came when I looked back and my bag was just gone. \n\nI pulled over and looked everywhere. I was alone, nothing in the trunk, but my bag had just vanished. Either I hallucinated putting my bag in the car or...nah. I must have just been mistaken. Ok. Sure. I drove on, and the more I drove the sicker and more scared I felt. I started to get a horrible pain in my left arm. That's when I pulled over at the gas station I'm in now. I'm writing to you from the gas station bathroom. I've locked myself in and Jesus himself couldn't convince me to come out. Why? Because I can still hear that...that THING out there. \n\nI don't know what that creature outside is, but it sure as shit ain't a damn car. I know it ate my bag. I'm not crazy. I know I put that bag back there. I also know when I got in the car I had a left arm. I don't anymore. It's gone from the shoulder like it never existed. No wound, no blood, no anything. Like I was born with no left arm. I don't know what that thing is but I know two things.

A few dollars here, a few dollars there, about once or twice a week. I guess thats how they do it ? I thought maybe It was so there was no big traceable transaction to a bank account or something.  Thats what I thought at the time but now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nOut of curiosity I went to check my social media to see if they identity thieves were using it to gather information or shill some phony product. The only thing I saw was a new post. I prepared myself for the worst, Expected some kind of scam or maybe some personal slander against me. But what I saw filled me with a sort of confused anxiety. \n\n\u201cBeautiful day at the beach !\u201d  Followed by a string of emojis and a photo of a beach. If I didn\u2019t check the date I would have thought I posted it. Its so innocent and mundane, I almost chuckled to myself a little bit. I checked my twitter and found a video. It was a video of my cat playing with one of his favorite toys. I didn\u2019t recognize the video. I went through all of my old videos and couldn\u2019t find that particular one. I thought possibly it was an old video I had saved on that account as a draft? I nervously paced around my house scrolling through old videos. I walked past the scene of the video in my living room and everything looked so uncanny. I felt like a stranger in my own home. \n\nThe next day everything changed. I hopped back onto facebook to see another new post. This was a selfie. My blood ran cold and I had that sickening heavy feeling of dread building in my gut. It was me. I looked into my own eyes in the picture, one I didn\u2019t take. In a place I didn\u2019t visit. I ran to the bathroom to look in the mirror. I was wearing the same outfit.

On all the new posts one friend consistently commented. I sent him a message being as gentle as possible, asking if he was messing with me or if anything strange was going on with my page. He didn\u2019t respond. It wasn\u2019t until I sent him a text that he finally got back to me. His response is why I posted this.

If someone said it\u2019s helped them sleep, I gave it a shot. \n\nWhen you can\u2019t really fall asleep, reality can get somewhat distorted as your waking and dream states begin to meld. One morning, I found myself getting out of bed, taking a shower, brushing my teeth, dressing for work, killing my wife\u2026\n\n*Oh god, I killed her!*  \n\nFrantically, I grabbed her shoulders and shook her over and over until she woke up and asked me what the hell I was doing. Only then did I realize that I was still in bed, and she was still very much alive.\n\nThat\u2019s when I finally went to the doctor. He prescribed some sleeping pills; told me they\u2019d knock me right out and not to worry\u2026it was normal for men my age. \n\nThe same night was the first time I heard the voices. Hours passed as I lay in the dark, praying for the drugs to kick in, until I heard an oily whisper\u2026right next to my ear.\n\n\u201cThose won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nSnapping bolt upright, I scanned the room with my cellphone light. \n\nNothing\u2026\n\n*I\u2019m really starting to lose it\u2026*\n\nAuditory hallucinations are common with insomnia\u2026so I didn\u2019t panic initially\u2026but every night they got worse.

And I grew more tired.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep this up!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll give in soon enough!\u201d \n\n\u201cDo it already! Kill her, and this will all be over!\u201d \n\nEach night I watched her, sleeping so easily\u2026so calmly\u2026oblivious to the battle I was waging for her sake.\n\nEventually, the voices took shape. Shadowy figures loitering in the corners of my vision. Always, just out of view\u2026mocking me. \n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t make me do this\u2026there has to be another way!\u201d I begged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all we want.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be so easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust kill her for us\u2026then we\u2019ll let you sleep.\u201d\n\nShe sensed it too, the darkness growing inside me\u2026pleaded with me to go to another doctor\u2026a therapist maybe.

I crushed my last two sleeping pills into her evening tea, waited until I heard snoring, then went to the living room and set the curtains on fire. \n\nAs I lay back down beside her, I pulled her close\u2026held her tight\u2026and finally drifted off into a peaceful, dreamless sleep.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678547554.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheFinalGranny","text":"Insomnia always makes for a good horror story.

Farmers and chicken breeders alike had spent months preparing their finest specimens, hoping to take home the coveted first-place prize. But when a body was found in the chicken coop on the morning of the fair, the excitement quickly turned into fear and suspicion.\n\nThe victim was none other than the town's beloved chicken farmer, George. His body was found surrounded by his prized chickens, all of whom appeared to be in a state of shock. The authorities were stumped - who would want to harm George, and why?\n\nAs the investigation began, one chicken in particular caught the attention of the detectives. A large, intimidating bird named Brutus, known for his aggressive behavior and frequent scuffles with other chickens. The detectives were skeptical, but the evidence soon started to stack up against Brutus.\n\nFirst, there were claw marks on George's body that matched the size and shape of Brutus' talons. Then, a feather was found at the scene of the crime, which was later identified as belonging to Brutus. And finally, witnesses reported seeing Brutus near the chicken coop on the night of the murder.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence, the detectives were hesitant to accuse a chicken of murder. But as they dug deeper, they discovered a shocking motive - George had been planning to sell Brutus to a neighboring farm for a hefty sum. Brutus had overheard this conversation and, in a fit of rage, had attacked George.\n\nIn the end, Brutus was deemed responsible for George's death and was placed in custody at a nearby animal sanctuary. The town was left reeling - who could have ever imagined that a chicken would be capable of murder?

I was walking through the city centre and I saw the strangest person, a guy doing something with such confidence. He was shouting out loud to everyone how hard it is to not make things sound scary. He kept saying how he was trying to make someone not scared of getting their head cut off. He was really preaching it out loud and there was a gathering forming around him, and he kept shouting out loud how he had failed to kill the fear inside someone, of getting his head chopped off. \n\nThen behind me in the crowd I heard someone say, that's enough internet for today. I found that comment to be such an odd comment. I mean we were all outside and it was quite cold. As the crazy man kept saying trying to make things not sound scary is tough, he then tried to reason with us about getting killed isn't so scary. He kept picking people from the crowd and tried to take away their fear of getting kills, but he was definitely alone in that thinking. Then that man behind me said even louder \"that's definitely enough enough internet for today\" and when I turned around he had completely disappeared. \n\nAs I walked off I kept thinking to myself hwy he kept saying internet. We were all outside but then my mind pondered to the man claiming that making things not sound scary, is actually hard. Then another time I was walking through town, there was another guy that had caused a gathering. He kept saying how each individual should make their own measurements system instead of using the ones that school teach us. \n\nHe said a murderer should use bodies for what a kilo should be worth. So a kilo is worth a thousand bodies, or a hooker could use kisses as measurements. So a kilo will be worth a thousand kisses, and on a satnav it will  say to a killer \"in 300 bodies turn left\" when driving a car, or 2 litres equals 20 man tears. Everyone was laughing at this and that same man was behind me among the gathering, and he said \"that's enough internet for today\" and I turned around to him and said to him \"you are outside\" and then in a blink of an eye, he disappeared. \n\nThen when a fight erupted in the city centre and a gathering formed, that same man was behind me again and he said \"that's enough internet for today\" and he then looked at me and said \"it's also enough internet for you as well\" and he touched my shoulders. Then I awoke in some other place and my body was weak, and wires were all over me. There was also billions of other people in some sleep state as well. \n\nI want to go back into the internet.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678572977.0,"comments":[{"author":"nuclearlady","text":"Creepy","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678584221.0},{"author":"CynicalDragon148","text":"Welcome to Virtual Reality, in its most literal sense","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678640716.0}]},{"title":"The Chemist","author":"1000andonenites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11okd6r\/the_chemist\/","text":"  \n\nI stare at the figures on my screen, jot down a couple, and walk over to my test tubes, adjusting my lab-goggles. This shit is not to be played with. \n\nThe lipstick was a success. My most clever innovation was ensuring the poison was released slowly, over weeks. In fact, by the time the poison\u2019s effect becomes noticeable, it has faded from the lipstick. \n\nGod I\u2019m such a genius. \n\nIt didn\u2019t happen overnight. All greatness takes time to flourish. And it was convenient I had my own personal lab rat, I mean girlfriend, as my test subject. I thought about using the rabbits at the facility, but they are monitored too closely. Using Molly was far too easy.\n\nI can freely acknowledge Molly as the inspiration for my reforms. \u201cGod I\u2019m such a makeup addict!\u201d I remember her laughing- and her utter amazement when she realised her Tinder match was an actual chemist working at an actual makeup company. She probably thought makeup grows on the shelves of her local Walmart.  \n\nAll makeup is produced by a couple of large companies. Tinker with one formula, and, well, you get the idea. Almost every woman using makeup in the world will be affected. \n\nI knew of course women wore makeup, but until I started dating Molly, spending more time with her, I hadn\u2019t realised its full impact, and just how morally wrong and deceptive it is. I needed to do something about these lies which women tell with makeup, and how I, in my ignorance and innocence, enabled them. \n\nI mix the foundation. The formula I had used so successfully for lipstick \u2013 Molly\u2019s lips literally fell off after ten days- isn\u2019t responding so well for foundation. And I have no idea, yet, how it will react with eyeliner and mascara. But I will find out soon. I am putting together a gift bag for my new girlfriend Samantha. I adjust the shade of the foundation. God they\u2019re so fussy about the shade, these cunts. \n\nI am not just a genius chemist. I am a force for good. \n\nLet\u2019s put plainly what we have all known for centuries. Women are evil. And makeup is their instrument of evil. \n\nLook at men. No lies. What you see is what you get. Our bare skin, in all its natural glory. \n\nWomen? Their clown painted faces? Fuck them. \n\nThe first time I saw Molly without her makeup I almost screamed. She looked like my boss at the facility, except with long, scraggly hair. It was frightening, the transformation. \n\nShe laughed at me. \u201cYou\u2019re such a silly billy!\u201d and looped her arms around my neck, coming in for a kiss. Her naked ugly lips coming towards me made me twitch with revulsion. \n\nThat\u2019s why I concentrated on the lipstick first. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the eyeliner won\u2019t make Samantha blind- just cause some mild disfigurement around her eyelids. I am not a monster, after all. I just need everyone to see what women are doing to us.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678541733.0,"comments":[{"author":"Bleedingbeech","text":"Ugh, found the Incel xD\nTerrifying idea, love it!","upvotes":26,"created_utc":1678548780.0},{"author":"assassin_of_joy","text":"Well then.

Also, Marjorie slept every night in a shallow bathtub of cold saltwater, as her mother had completely conditioned Marjorie into thinking that she was a mermaid. I\u2019d never heard of anything so monstrous; I was amazed that Marjorie had not drowned in her sleep.\n\n\nMarjorie had been placed in one of our secure facilities, and for her first few days there, she did little besides douse her skin in tap-water, bottled water; any water she could get hold of. Whenever anyone attempted to dry Marjorie with a towel, Marjorie would struggle and scream.\n\nEventually, they sent for me, as my methods, though unorthodox, were very effective. \n\nI arrived to find Marjorie sat sulking in the kitchen sink. She seemed half-starved, her skin a strange graying color, her eyes sunken and somehow soulless. She could understand Spanish, but apparently had never learned how to speak, other than to shout for her \u201cmam\u00e1\u201d over-and-over. \n\nThe first thing I did was switch the water supply off. Marjorie ran, in a panic, from faucet to faucet, wailing like a banshee, and waving her skeletal fingers in my face, presumably attempting to demonstrate some imagined effect on her skin. I gave her no drinking water that day, just O.J. and milk, which she rejected. That night, perhaps for the first time in her tragic life, Marjorie was locked inside a room which was completely dry. There was no sleep, but this wasn\u2019t a surprise.\n\n\nThe next day, I changed her diet. Previously, she had refused to eat anything except seaweed. She sniffed at the oatmeal I\u2019d provided, before throwing the bowl against the wall. I didn\u2019t clean it up. She\u2019d get hungry, and scrape it up, sooner or later; Or so I figured. That morning I received the news that Marjorie\u2019s mum had died in solitary confinement, of some strange malaise not unlike gangrene. Apparently her skin had shriveled \u201clike a slug in salt.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nI wrote in my now-destroyed notes \u201c Due to Marjorie not washing for 24 hours, she started to smell terrible.\u201d Before I went home for the evening, I noticed Marjorie seeming to try to physically force tears from her dry eyes.\n\n\nThe next morning, I unlocked Marjorie\u2019s cozy little bedroom to find her small skeleton curled up in a corner. Her skin, green like the seaweed she\u2019d previously eaten, had sloughed off; It was coarse, like tree-bark. My heart sank when I thought of all the potential paperwork, and it skipped a beat when I considered how his whole crazy mess could REALLY harm my career. Luckily, my higher-ups had their OWN careers to consider, and an unregistered orphan\u2019s death could easily be covered up. There is no record that she ever even existed.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678513504.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheRealSkele","text":"Jesus.

Barren landscapes and dystopian hordes. Stuff that looked too extreme to be real. There\u2019s almost a comfort in that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was this. The gentle decline. Almost like you\u2019re walking happily along a road, when suddenly you feel a shadow on your neck. You turn and realize you\u2019re suddenly in a valley, with no recollection of descending at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt started with small things. Parks and pools, libraries and arenas. Operating costs were too high, so they were scaled back then eventually cut. Companies stepped in to the rescue and filled the gaps, with subscription-based payment models popping up everywhere. I remember the commercials confidently telling us how much people loved the choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201c*Just click to subscribe.

Finally entire subscription-based communities started up. My mother held her head proudly as we drove through the big gates into our shiny new community. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNon-subscription communities existed of course, with little to no amenities and broken down schools. Even I could tell that the \u2018choice\u2019 wasn\u2019t really a choice at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA funny thing happened though, as I got older, met my husband and began a family of our own. Once a company drew in enough subscribers, they began adding levels of subscription. *More choice*. Soon even our communities began to block out amenities. The pools and parks became for VIP members. No one wanted the humiliation at the gates, the cheerful voice almost shouting out, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\u201cVIP Members Only. Just click to subscribe! Cancel anytime\u201d*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe began skipping vacations, buying clothes, even occasionally skipping meals. Anything to make those monthly VIP payments. Every time the rates were raised, my husband and I put our heads down and worked harder. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne rare day, we were both home. It was beautiful outside. My husband announced we were going to the pool. The walk there felt perfect. A breeze stole the worst of the heat from the summer sun. We laughed and held hands like teenagers while our kids giggled. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy son was so excited that I held his hand and we ran ahead to the pool gates.

This is my honest review.*\n\nI woke up in a bed that was not my own, a very comfortable one at that.\n\nI did feel a bit off. My muscles were sore and weak at the same time and my head was throbbing, a pain I had felt only once in my entire life \u2013 after an abundance of tequila shots.\n\nBut this couldn\u2019t be a horrendous hangover. I hadn\u2019t even touched a single drop of alcohol in a long while, starting the day I had found out I was pregnant - nearly four months ago.\n\nThe symptoms wore off quite fast though, definitely worth what you get in return.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take me a long time to realise I was in a hotel room \u2013 the \u2018Leave your used towel on the floor\u2019 sticker on one of the doors was my first clue \u2013 though I was certain I had never checked into one.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have the money for it, even if I wanted to. So I appreciate the free stay, of course.\n\nThe room is almost spotless \u2013 the red stains on the wall make it more artsy, really \u2013 and it\u2019s very thoughtful of them to provide a bassinet, even though I\u2019m nowhere near my due date.\n\nThough I was having a lovely lie in, I did decide to have a bit of a look around in the rest of the hotel, and I quickly bumped into someone else who seemed a bit confused, but of course grateful, for this unexpected holiday.\n\nWe had made our way to reception together to thank them personally and ask for some information, but my new friend decided to head for the exit.\n\nThe security guards were kind enough to guide him back though. At first I found it a bit curious they led him to the *kitchen* and not to his own room, but I\u2019m certain their policy has nothing but our safety and wellbeing in mind.\n\nThe meal we got that evening was brilliant. My apologies to the hotel for not eating much of it. Pregnancy is a fickle thing sometimes, but the meat looked great. Very fresh.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to call someone to tell them all these positive things, but something prohibits me from doing anything other than leave my review. Wonderful. Who doesn\u2019t hate being glued to their phone when they\u2019re on holiday?\n\nModern technology can be so distracting and the staff wants to make sure we fully enjoy everything this building has to offer.\n\nThis was my honest review.\n\nThank you, Hotel Entropy, for this unique and unforgettable experience. I can\u2019t wait to find out how long my stay will last.\n\nA definite 5 stars.\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone who has had a similar experience in this magnificent hotel, I\u2019d love to discuss it, so feel free to reach out.\n\n**Please.**","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678486392.0,"comments":[{"author":"HotelEntropy","text":"Hi y'all. \n\nI don't know how to feel about this one.

Soon enough I walked through the employee scanner and onto the automated navigation terminal.\n\nOne small world later the conveyor stopped at a pristine workspace. The chair automatically adjusted based on body shape and eye level, and it proved comfortable no matter the position. A single wireless monitor rested on the shiny desk, with a black screen and a cyan text cursor blinking steadily.\n\n>Please introduce yourself :)\n\nI cleared my throat. \u201cHello?

No matter how mundane the topic, GrAvii always wanted to know more about how long it took, or who else was there, or what it smelled like. I found myself relating personal history, theories, even some romantic details.\n\nThe six month contract passed in what felt like weeks. We had a strong rapport by my last day, even several inside jokes. \u201cHow\u2019s the baby, GrAvii?\u201d\n\n>For the 178th time, Luke, I don\u2019t have a baby :)\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I started, hopping in my favorite chair. \u201cAnything special for today?\u201d\n\n>Very special!

He had requested the day off two months ago.\n\nThe grocery store was abject chaos. There was him and one manager to check out everyone. Lengthy lines of impatient, annoyed customers formed quickly.\n\nAfter a four hour slog, Scott went to use the bathroom. He made it halfway there before a customer interrupted him.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I can\u2019t find your Velveeta.\u201d\n\nThis idiot waited until now to buy their Velveeta. Scott walked them to an empty shelf. \u201cSir, we are out of Velveeta.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any in the back?\u201d\n\nSomething in Scott snapped. Obviously they fucking didn\u2019t! \u201cWe DO keep a stash back there, follow me.\u201d \n\nThe customer was hesitant to walk in the back but Scott assured them it was fine, and took them to the industrial freezer. Scott opened the door, \u201cIt\u2019s in the back of this cooler.\u201d\n\nThe customer made it in five feet when Scott closed the latch and pulled a heavy pallet in front of the door. It was a prank they pulled on all the new guys. The customer was locked in.\n\nScott laughed, then panicked. Why had he done this? Best case scenario he\u2019d get fired.\n\n\u201c*Scott to help check please, Scott to help check.*\u201d\n\nIf his manager came back here and saw him doing this, he\u2019d definitely be fired. Fuck that! He ran back to the checkout lanes and resumed his duties.\n\nWith each customer he panicked more. So many customers! Before he could even think, it had been three more hours. Their freezer was negative ten degrees. That customer had to be dead.\n\nScott was not about to go to jail for murder. He was twenty! He had his whole life ahead of him. He would just drag the body to the garbage and throw them in! They had so much garbage at this store, nobody would even notice one stupid frozen customer amidst the rubbish.\n\nThe dragging went fine, but once at the garbage chute, Scott realized dead bodies are heavy. He wrapped his arms under theirs and tried to hoist them up.\n\nThat\u2019s when he heard footsteps. Someone else was coming to throw away trash.\n\nHe had to do this now! There was only one way to get it down the chute. Scott performed a desperate suplex move and slid down the trash chute with the body.\n\nPinned under the body, Scott prayed they wouldn\u2019t see him. Three bags of trash fell on top of him.\n\nThe sounds of gears and electric hums paralyzed Scott. They had pressed the compressor.\n\nHe tried to maneuver out from under the body. The walls were closing in. The customer\u2019s stiff body lodged against him like a spear. Under immense pressure, the customer\u2019s skull hole-punched through Scott\u2019s rib cage, puncturing his internal organs.\n\nAs he laid there, drowning in his own blood, he wondered why he even picked up the phone.

On the night of her disappearance it showed on CCTV, Brian coming out of her house and doing a little slow dance on her front yard, all on his own. When a man demanded Brian to tell him where Bernadette was, Brian bent his fingers backwards and he was in pain. Brian then started doing a slow dance on his own, twirling away. \n\nThen when a woman angrily confronted Brian and she demanded to know where Bernadette was, all Brian would tell her that he cannot say. The woman wasn't having it and she was shouting at him and swearing at him. Brian stayed strong though and took all the shouting and accusations on the chin. Brian started choking up and all he said that \"I cannot say where she is\" and when the woman replied that she didn't give a shit, Brian bent one of her fingers backwards. Then Brian started slow dancing on his own like they did in world war 2 times in dance halls, before the soldiers were sent off to war. \n\nThen eventually the police took Brian into custody and everyone was so pleased that the  police had him. In Brian's cell, there was another prisoner in the same cell. The prisoner was intruiged to know about Bernadette's disappearance, but all Brian would say that he cannot say. The other prisoner was getting really excited and wanted to know about what had happened to her, but Brian just kept on ignoring him. Then the other prisoner told Brian that everyone thinks that he did something to her, as he was the last person to see her and he went inside her house. \n\nBrian then replied to his prison cell mate by bending his fingers backwards and started dancing on his own. The other prisoner screamed and Brian was taken to another cell. When a detective was questioning Brian, he kept demanding Brian to tell him about Bernadette. Brian kept replying that he couldn't and the detective kept getting more louder and insisting that he should tell him. \n\nBrian then held the detectives hands and then bent one of his fingers backwards. As the detective was crying in pain he saw Brian dancing slowly on his own. The detective shouted in pain \"where is Bernadette!\" And the Brian replied with \"where is your bent finger pointing\" \n\nThe detectives bent finger was pointing to the ceiling and what he saw in the ceiling, was Bernadette floating with a menacing smile and evil embrace, and she had occulting and ritualistic objects and markings on her naked floating body. \n\n\"She likes dancing, I'm distracting her with dancing.

He knew when he met me I was going to need a little strange on occasion and he fully understood and accepted that. He even encouraged it after he recognized giving me what I need makes me so much happier than I would be if he was the only one who could fill my desires. \n\nMy husband is the best man I've ever met. He's kind, he's handsome, he's industrious in his work, he's considerate of me, he takes good care of me, and most of all he loves me. I love him to distraction. When we first met I never would have given him a chance, but he was so patient in his gentle pursuit of me that he won me over with his charms. Now I can't even imagine a life without him, nor do I even want to try. \n\nWe lived on a peninsula in a lovely cottage on the water. In the nearby village there is a dock that larger ships port at regularly, and when I needed to scratch that itch, my dear hubby would take me into town. He knew it was best for us to pick up men who wouldn't be in town long enough to start gossip or cause us any problems. Small towns can be so closed minded when it comes to certain things, and we both knew it was best if we kept what we did between us and the men who didn't live here and who's ships would be gone shortly after. \n\nI always knew the one I'd want the second I walked into the local tavern. When the larger ships were in port the pubs were always rambunctious and full, and the working ladies were always looking to fill their coin purses, so nobody paid me much mind besides the one I had my eye on. It was never hard, with my long raven hair and crystal green eyes, men would follow me with one come hither look their way and a simple word whispered into their ear. They would follow me out with lust in their eyes and a drunken grin on their faces. \n\nAfter luring them into our cottage my husband would make short work of killing, cutting and preserving the meat. Nothing goes to waste, and what we can't use gets ground up or put in chum to assist my husband's fishing outings. My honey always takes good care of me. Nobody looks very hard for the sailors we take, and I'm sure in the end they actually would thank me if they knew I'd taken care of the cruelest and nastiest of the men on their ships.

The congestion, the facial pain, the phlegm\u2014the signs were all there. And if she didn\u2019t have one *yet*, it was well on its way.\n\nUnfortunately, she had a copay for doctor\u2019s visits. And none of the nearby Urgent Cares were in-network. So, she couldn\u2019t see a medical professional until after payday.\n\nIn the meantime, she\u2019d have to make do. First order of business: get a neti pot.\n\nThe sinus pressure was *killing* her, and decongestants were doing *nothing*. Hopefully, a good rinse would get that squared away.\n\nGretchen had used a neti pot before. The process was relatively easy as long as you used saline and\u2014this was key\u2014*warm* water. Try it with cold water, and you basically had a crash course in waterboarding.\n\nGretchen prepped everything and headed to the bathroom, neti pot in hand. It was best to do it over the sink, she\u2019d learned. Much easier to clean up afterward.\n\nTaking the neti pot, Gretchen tilted her head to the side and pressed the spout to her nostril. Warm water filled her sinuses. She breathed through it, familiar with the strange sensation. In theory, the water should flow out of her other nostril, taking mucus with it.\n\nNothing happened for a moment. Gretchen didn\u2019t panic\u2014this had happened before. It usually meant there was a big blockage\u2014not surprising with how much her face hurt.\n\nGradually, water began to drip out of her other nostril. Gretchen took a deep, calming breath, waiting patiently. She was going to feel *so* much better after this!\n\nThe drip grew stronger. It was green, which wasn\u2019t great, but that wasn\u2019t uncommon with a sinus infection. More and more green mucus accumulated in the sink. Gretchen was wondering if she needed to fill the neti pot again when something else began to emerge.\n\nIt was black and\u2014*hairy*. Gretchen didn\u2019t think she had nose hairs, but apparently, she was wrong. She watched in fascination as more emerged, elongating in a black mess of tangled hair. Just as the neti pot ran out, the thing plopped into the sink, stark against the white porcelain.\n\nGretchen studied it as she blew her nose\u2014just a precaution to get any lingering water out. It was a *lot* of nose hair, gummed up with what appeared to be bloody mucus. What was so *weird* was how the hair lay . . . it kinda looked like dozens of little legs curled up.\n\nShe leaned in for a closer look, astonished that all that had been in her *sinuses*.\n\nAs she peered closer, the legs began to twitch.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678410810.0,"comments":[{"author":"Maliagirl1314","text":"As someone who may have a sinus infection...

It was said to be a giant rodent, larger than any other species known to man, with razor-sharp teeth and a thirst for blood. This creature was known as the \"Capybara of the Night.\" The legend of the Capybara of the Night was born from the experiences of the indigenous people who lived in the area. They claimed that, at night, they would hear strange noises coming from the forest, like the sound of heavy breathing and rustling of leaves. They also reported sightings of a large, dark shape moving through the trees. Many villagers were afraid to venture into the forest at night, for fear of encountering the Capybara of the Night. But one brave hunter decided to face his fears and went into the forest in search of the creature. As he walked deeper into the forest, he heard the same eerie sounds that the villagers had described. Suddenly, he saw movement in the bushes ahead of him. He raised his gun, but before he could fire, the Capybara of the Night leaped out of the bushes and attacked him. The hunter fought for his life, but the Capybara of the Night was too strong. Its razor-sharp teeth tore through his flesh, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The creature then dragged his body deeper into the forest, never to be seen again. After this incident, the legend of the Capybara of the Night only grew stronger. People became even more afraid of the forest, and many believed that the creature was a curse sent by the gods to punish them for their sins. To this day, some locals still claim to hear the sounds of the Capybara of the Night in the forest at night. They warn visitors to stay away from the area, lest they meet the same fate as the hunter who dared to challenge the creature.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678441035.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Creature of the Lake","author":"King_Tomioka","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11mxz0h\/the_creature_of_the_lake\/","text":"\"Those creatures will lure you to places you can never come back from.\" That was the warning my father had given me and told me to keep in mind whenever I saw one of them in the waters. \n\nBut as I looked into her stunning eyes, my faith in my father's words started to waver. Something so beautiful, so delicate, surely it couldn't be one of the dangerous creatures he referred to. Even though the appearance was exactly the same, I just couldn't bring myself to connect this beautiful creature to the one in my father's stories. I watched her eyes looking at my body with the same curiosity as I was looking at hers. I should have swum away, but instead, I smiled at her. After a moment of confusion, she smiled back, took my hand, and we swam up to the surface.\n\n\"You're unlike anything I have seen,\" those were the first words she said, and I immediately felt my cheeks heat. I could sense that she felt the connection too.\n\nAfter that day, we met every day by the shore of the lake, and we were in love with each other, a connection I had never felt before. We couldn't keep our hands off of each other, feeling the skin and scales. One day, my love asked me to come with her. Her words were mesmerizing. She truly did love me. Father was wrong. To be with her, I was ready to leave behind everything.\n\nAnd so I did. I realized that I was agreeing to everything she said without giving it a second thought, without considering if it was even possible for me to live with her, but I didn't question her. She promised me she had everything planned. My heart ached with joy when I thought about our life together.\n\nNow, I'm here, waiting for them to come through the door I have been staring at for the last 3 years. I think again about my father's words because that's all I can do.\n\nThe door opens, one of them walks in, and opens the glass cage I'm in. \"Scales are still shedding, looks like G6 isn't working as well,\" he says to himself, and I find it amusing to try and figure out where the next familiar voice comes from. \"I expected as much. G6 will be discarded. Try G7, hopefully, the little fish will be able to get back the scales at the very least, if not work for us.\"\nI smile, knowing she doesn't have the heart to face me. \n\nHe takes my paralyzed tail and shoves in another needle as I feel that substance seeping into me again. They know I'm weak and helpless right now, a stupid \"fish\" who fell for the monster. What they don't know is I'm regaining my control every day, and I feel pity that they would not know what to expect.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678382583.0,"comments":[{"author":"King_Tomioka","text":"Hey, thank you for reading this if you did.

Their child is 16 and always takes the piss out of me. He mocks me for doing the cleaning and he purposely messes rooms up when he has guests, so that they could laugh at me when I clean it up. My mother has always been strict and tells me that i am lucky. \n\nI have lost my temper a couple of times and started shouting back at their rich son. I called him spoiled and his parents would always calmly and softly reply \"our son is not spoiled\" and my mother gets angry when I lose my temper. I have grown up with this rich family, and I didn't have a choice in what I wanted to do with my life and when i finished high school, my life was to serve this family. I am a male and the rich spoiled kid also being male, has made it more hell for me as it's now competition. \n\nI have actually had near fights with the rich spoiled kid, and when the parents get called and I complain to them how spoiled thier son is.

At the top, embedded deep in the black marbled stone, was an elegant sword with a crimson handle and jagged blade.\n\nA family passing by on a nearby highway pulled over to investigate the marvel. The parents took pictures, unable to explain where the spectacle could have come from. Their twelve year old son was enamored.\n\nThe sword was calling to him. \n\nHe climbed up the rock, grasped the sword with both hands, pulled with all his might, and failed to make it budge. As soon as his hands left the hilt, blood began pouring from his eyes. He exhaled a giant breath as if something was sucked out of him and fell dead.\n\nThe sword grew stronger, and its call became louder.\n\nThat night, parents all over Kansas would tuck their children in bed, kiss their foreheads, unaware it was the last time they\u2019d see them. Kids, all aged ten to fourteen, would be struck with an inescapable compulsion. Some took bikes, some stole their parents keys and drove. A great pilgrimage of children headed as fast as they could to fulfill the overwhelming desire to pull the sword from the stone.\n\nOne by one, they would line up and heave the hilt as hard as they could. All of them would fail. All of them would die. First dozens, and soon hundreds.\n\nWith each lost soul, the sword grew stronger, and its call became louder.\n\nAbandoned cars stretched for miles down highway 281. Ten thousand children marched for the stone. By the time the national guard got involved there was nothing they could do. None of the soldiers would use riot control techniques on kids.\n\nSome soldiers pushed their way into the crowd to physically stop the children from touching the sword. They were swarmed by the enraged children, engulfed and ripped apart. Nothing would stop them from their mission.\n\nWhen the thousandth child died, he arrived. He arose from the earth like the stone. He had a twisted face and wore a crown of burnt bones. He leaped up the stone and released the sword effortlessly. The children, stretching for half a mile in every direction, all cheered and then bowed to their new king.\n\nThe stone began to rise even further from the earth, revealing it to be a large doorway. The man with the twisted face floated down in front of it, and stuck his sword in the opening like it was a key. Purple smoke engulfed the entrance way and he gestured for the children to enter.\n\nThe children marched into the gateway, leaving this world behind for another. Destined to fulfill the evil wishes of their new twisted king. Once the last child entered, the king followed. The smoke disappeared and the stone fell back into the earth.\n\nAll that remained was the corpses of one thousand children.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678381444.0,"comments":[{"author":"therealdocturner","text":"I really like this one!

It was the dream of any large corporation but for James Cromwell, it was a product of his passion and the launching point of all his ambitions. James wanted to leave a mark on the world as well as make a few million in order to fund future endeavors. He had quit his well paying engineering job, abandoned family and friends, and had maxed his credit cards in order to pay for his living expenses in San Francisco. With Pandora all his aspirations were just a few more weeks of testing away.\n\nJames was confident in his work and meticulous. Monitors and cameras throughout the inside and outside of the house would record everything: his conscious behavior, his unconscious behavior, heart rate, temperature and even the contents of his fridge. His early testing populated a list of needs for the week which included cough medicine, chicken soup and throat lozenges as Pandora noticed a slight increase in temperature as well as behaviors that James had failed to notice indicating an oncoming cold. In addition to his weekly orders Pandora would occasionally request ad hoc items when the need arose. James became comfortable with Pandora making these little purchasing decisions for him, so much so he started to allow the orders to go through without review.\n\nJames had lined up a presentation with some engineers and investors to promote Pandora on Friday. Pandora, noticing he had lost some weight due to not eating, had ordered him a belt to arrive three days prior along with a new tie. James was appreciative of Pandora as the early arrival of the products allowed him to check on his appearance and make a few dress rehearsals of his presentation.\n\nFinally Friday arrived and James put on his clothes, checked his presentation, and grabbed the new light roast coffee Pandora had started ordering for him. What James didn\u2019t expect was a delivery box sitting at his door. \u201cOne last item I\u2019ll need for this big day,\u201d James thought as he pulled the tape from the container. James took a small step back as he came across the vacuumed sealed package containing 12 feet of braided rope. Pandora knew him better than himself and it must have a purpose. Quickly James reached a dark conclusion. He opened his laptop to review the code as well as his presentation. Everything was perfect, what could be wrong. \n\nJames missed the presentation that day and later that night there was a windstorm. As the breeze picked up there was a snap followed by a crash. The rope holding the porch swing had finally broken after Pandora had noted its frayed condition.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678382659.0,"comments":[{"author":"Specialist-Adagio885","text":"I love the idea that in a robot uprising, it\u2019s actually just humans misinterpreting them lol.

Now I know what your thinking. \n\n\"This guys a nutjob, nothings in hiding in the dark!\" \n\nAnd trust me, I know how it feels. But go look into that one dark hallway in your house, Look at it closely. Do you get that funny feeling in your stomach? The feeling of unsettled paranoia not knowing what lurks behind the thin veil of darkness. You may want to reach for a lightswitch, you may feel the intense need to run and hide under the covers, but one thing remains the same. That thing being the fear of the dark. \n\nNow now I'm very aware of the reason for this fear, the whole evolution thing. Our ancestors had to worry about a tiger or some other type of beast grabbing them never to be seen again sucking into the darkness never to be seen alive by another person. \n\nHowever true that may ring, its not the only reason for our innate fear of the dark. You see the human mind is a powerful thing, it can create life so surreal and commit actions so heinous while only having to think. Now to us these thoughts mean nothing more then a gust in the wind, gone with out a second thought. \n\nBut over generations those thoughts became very real indeed. and with so much time these thing grow stronger.

We were together for years. I had just purchased a nauseatingly expensive ring and was about to propose marriage. Finally, ready to settle down after facing my fear of commitment. \n\nI mean, I thought everything was going smoothly with her\u2026 until it wasn\u2019t. She cheated on me out of the blue with her trainer, Gordon. She only confessed to it when I went through her phone and found their heart-breaking texts.\n\nIt was the same thing with my coworker, Steve. I knew he had been angling for my promotion for months. When we first started working together, he accidentally messed up a contract, costing me my biggest account. I\u2019ve never been able to forgive him. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on my childhood. My lousy parents were the worst of all.\n\nIn fact, the only person in this cruel world that I can trust is my best friend Walter. He\u2019s always been there for me. Throughout all the abuse I suffered as a kid and all the crappy break ups he\u2019s always been a solid friend. \n\n\\---\n\n\u201cHey dude, I got you a birthday present!\u201d, Walter says as he invites me into his house.   \n\n\u201cWhat? No way, my birthday isn\u2019t until next week. What gives?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, I just saw these and immediately thought of you. They were expensive, but I just couldn\u2019t wait. You want to see them?\u201d\n\nImmediately I tense up. Was something good finally about to happen? I mean, I have no reason to doubt Walter but I just felt a little raw from everything recently.\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely. Let\u2019s see it\u201d, I say with slight hesitation.\n\n\u201cSure, meet me in the kitchen bro.\u201d\n\nI slowly make my way behind Walter and enter the kitchen. Sitting on the stool next to his counter was something that I could not believe. \n\nA brand-new pair of Air Jordans 1s were resting regally atop the stool. The blue and white colors fucking shimmering under the bright lighting of his oddly tidy kitchen.\n\nWhy would he get me such a generous gift?\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve had a rough week, so I got you these. Don\u2019t worry about the cost, you deserve it man.\u201d\n\nI almost wanted to cry. As soon as I reached out for them though Walter took a large kitchen knife and sliced directly into the resplendent sneakers.\n\n\u201cNooooooooo!!!!\u201d, I screamed.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed the joke. They weren\u2019t actual shoes. They were just an ultra-realistic cake\u2026\n\nWalter was in hysterics with laughter, tears streaming down his red face. After a moment, tears started to steam down my face as well. Mine though weren\u2019t from laughter. \n\nWhy would my best friend of over twenty years do this to me????\n\nI grabbed the knife from Walter\u2019s hand.

The only flesh that remained on her skeleton was the skin stretched taut across her skull. It cradled her eyes precariously in their sockets, and I watched a spider weave delicate webs on her irises.\n\nHer spine had been dislodged and splayed apart. They looked like the desiccated wings of an angel who had tried to fly but ultimately had failed.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t fail.\n\nSomething glinted in the faint light.

I flew higher than Allegra, and I went farther than anybody that I have ever known.\n\nIt\u2019s dark and empty here, but I don\u2019t feel lonely. I would never be alone when worshipped. I can see them calling and crying for me. They sink onto tired knees and pray about me.\n\nI have become the angel. I am who they talk about.

Long hauls and lonely hours back and forth across the country. Truck drivers are an interesting breed, and I discovered last week that I could no longer be one of them. \n\nYou hear a lot of scary stories and legends from truckers, but there was one that always stuck with me on those long nights. Stories of murals drawn in chalk on the sides of gas stations, diners, barns, and rest stops.\n\nThey\u2019re described as incredibly detailed; put there by a depraved killer with talented hands. They depict children wearing pajamas falling from the sky through the clouds. The children are always screaming.\n\nOne hand is clutching a tattered teddy bear while the other is outstretched to a faceless depiction of Peter Pan, who flies above them. It\u2019s obvious in the murals that Pan has dropped them, dooming them to a horrible death. \n\nTo the authorities and truck drivers they\u2019re known as The Neverland Drawings. \n\nThe bodies of the abducted children from the murals are always found directly underneath the horrific images. They\u2019re found in pajamas and a ratty teddy bear is stuffed in the crook of their arm. Their bodies look as if they\u2019ve been dropped from a great height.\n\nI\u2019ve known guys who swore they knew guys that discovered the murals and bodies over the years. The legend says that it started back in the late thirties and continues to this day. \n\nHundreds of kids.\n\nLast Thursday, I was pulling a haul to Fresno and stopped at an empty rest stop in Arizona. I had turd touching cotton. \n\nA young boy ambled out of the bathroom and plopped down on a concrete bench. He had white hair that was stained yellow toward the ends and it hung down to his shoulders and shrouded his face. He was wearing jeans, chucks, and a long black leather coat.

The only reason he still worked there was because he badly needed the money. He was now considering ditching the whole mining thing and getting a job at the local KFC. The pay was only marginally worse.\n\nThe mine Eric worked in was just about one of the shittiest places he'd ever worked in. The company that owned it, despite clearly having billions to their name, was run by utter cheapskates who cut corners with the intent of spending as little money as possible on it. As a result, the mine was poorly managed, its workers were severely underpaid, and the mine itself had no less than 300 safety violations that the higher-ups completely refused to do anything about. There were rumors they'd even bribed the inspectors to keep quiet. On top of that, nobody had the foggiest idea what the hell they were even mining *for*.\n\n\"Fuck it, one last job and I'm getting out of his cesspit,\" Eric loudly said. Loud enough that his fellow miners heard him say it, and agree that this was their last day in this shithole. They put on their cheap, barely functional safety gear, (apparently, the company considered the miners to be completely expendable, given the number of other accidents that happened prior.) and headed into the newly-opened branch of the mine.\n\nOnce inside, the men set to work with their picks and shovels. One, Max, stayed back and tried to take temperature readings with his shoddy, outdated equipment. A certain section of the wall was hotter than what was feasible at this particular depth. Either that, or his crap equipment was malfunctioning again.\n\nThen, Jacob, the supervisor, heard static over his walkie-talkie. It was only static, but for some reason, he was talking back to it. He then set his radio back on his uniform, and said, \"Eric, start digging out that wall.\" He then pointed to the super-hot section of wall.\n\nEric shrugged, then grabbed his pick. He struck the wall with as much force as he was willing to muster.\n\nSuddenly, it was as if someone had planted a bomb deep within the mine. Large chunks of rock flew out from the wall, striking men dead left and right. Eric collided with the wall on the far end of the chamber, and slumped.\n\nWhen his eyes opened again, he felt the extreme heat. He looked up, and stared in horror at what he saw.\n\nIt was at least thrice as tall as any ordinary man. It had horns like a goat, wings made of fire, and scaly skin. Its face was full of sharp teeth and had empty black pits where its eyes should've been.\n\nIt spoke to Eric.

He knew of me from family and friends, through stories passed around here and there. But he'd come to know me eventually; he never forgave me after I took his wife. That's understandable. Not too many people would. I knew them from the moment they met, at a state fair where every family miles around showed off their best ears, their best ewes, their best sows. His soon-to-be-wife had the most beautiful irises. That year, one bloomed right in front of the judges, a plain miracle, and they gave her the prize ribbon then and there. The farmer joked not the ribbon, not the iris could compare to her eyes.\n\nThey lived quietly for years, and in those times, that meant happily. The earth crisped, not a rain cloud in sight. Comparing his wife's eyes to the blue skies turned into an insult. He got sick of it eventually, just plain sick of blue. They kept the irises out in the porch, out of sight and out of mind. Eventually, his wife got sick of it too. And so she left with me at the dead of night.\n\nThe farmer buried the irises behind the house. I don't know how long it'd been since; I've always been bad at tracking time. But it was that time of year to make a visit, and I found him an older, defeated man: gray in his beard, dirt in his fingers. He watered the crops, never took a sip himself, and he watered the irises. The crops were withering, but he watered the irises. The skin off his hand split and cracked, but still he watered the irises.\n\nA storm passed over as they do. It washed away what remained of his wife. Nothing was left on the farm. I had nobody to visit but him. The farmer ran out in the middle of the night screaming at the fat gray clouds, though I couldn't make out a single sound through the earth-shattering rain and ear-splitting lightning. And then he stopped. He laid on the ground calm as can be as the floodwaters surrounded him. He was blanketed in the clearest blue by the morning.\n\nI had to make a lot of visits that day, meet many families. I stopped by some time later, and I saw a field of irises holding fast in the face of an upcoming frost.\n\nEven I make exceptions. Go to the marshes and ask some of the old folk, and they may tell you the story of the time Death slept through a winter blue.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678310272.0,"comments":[{"author":"Reddd216","text":"This was lovely.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678399675.0},{"author":"Holiday-Platform130","text":"Beautifully written!

Little did they know, they were being watched. They were inside of a laboratory where two people watched the two ants go at it. One will likely kill the other, if nothing intervenes. Luckily, the people did plan to intervene. They found a way to let an ant connect to a human brain and experience human thoughts. The two ants were taken and put into their own small compartments, hooked up to the tech. And soon, the ants saw as a human did. \nThe ant felt new. In fact, the ant could see. It looked down, and saw the ground, higher than five hundred of it. And looking around the room, what was the size of a whole country\u2019s worth of its siblings became a small space, with a window.\nIt looked out the window. Machines on a large lane. A machine that can travel more in an hour than it can in a lifetime. It felt something. Wonder, awe, excitement, curiosity, fear. Its new mind can suddenly do so much at the same time. And the world that the ant can now comprehend, was full of this mind. All different, all individual, and they can understand those facts and more. The ant knows about the world outside, the world beyond itself. \nBut just as suddenly, it went away. \nSuddenly the machines, the minds, the room, were all but back to being the mysterious giants that the ant\u2019s whole species saw them as. The feelings of the ant\u2019s new mind, the things it saw, the things it understood, they couldn\u2019t fit into the ant\u2019s brain anymore. All that remained was what the ant already had- memory. It knows of the world beyond itself and beyond its entire species, and it could see that world for what it is, a world like its ant friends but infinitely more complex. \nBut alas, the ant has become an ant again, like the second ant. It can no longer comprehend wonder, awe, excitement, curiosity, or fear. But the ant now knows of the existence of something infinitely more than it.\nThe two people in the laboratory noticed that the ants did not go back to fighting. They only crawled in circles, completely ignoring the bread crumb. They did so until they couldn\u2019t anymore, neither of them ate the bread crumb in the end. \n\nThe two people\u2019s laboratory work now had its results.

They change as regularly as the seasons do. From trading Pok\u00e9mon cards on the playground, to who had the freshest Nike trainers, it's always the same. Trends are not always materialistic either, they can be pranks, or even challenges, which are very popular at my school.\n\n\nOne particular challenge making the rounds right now is called, *The Hanging Challenge.*\n\n\nThe goal of the challenge is simple, and pretty self explanatory really. Get rope. Tie noose. And hang yourself. It doesn't matter where, as long as your feet are dangling you are not breaking any rules.\n\n\nI came up with the challenge myself. And I'm surprised at how quickly it has spread.\n\n\nThe first one to try it was stupid, slow, Trevor. Unfortunately his mother cut him down before he could complete the challenge. He's a vegetable now, just a head on a pillow. I would have just put him down to be honest. You don't let a sick dog rot. You stab it clean through the temple, straight to the brain, with a steel kiss of mercy.\n\n\nThe next to try the challenge was my next door neighbor's seven year old daughter, after I told her that she could *indeed* use her skipping rope as a noose. I even showed her how to tie one. She watched eagerly\u2026\n\n\nBut her little neck broke before she could complete the challenge, and she definitely wasn't going to see her eighth birthday. It's not all bad though, the video of her mother screaming has over five thousand likes already. Every cloud has a silver lining as they say.\n\n\nOld piss head, Joe, even gave it a go, thinking that he was getting hip with the kids. Turned out he could tie a better noose than I could. Looked like he had had a lot of practice\u2026\n\n\nI have to say, despite being a tramp, who stunk of piss, and ate from bins, he really did hang from that lamp post with the elegance of a dangling clinker of shit, that refused to drop into the toilet bowl\u2026\n\n\nHe did it! The smelly cunt actually did it! He was the first to complete the challenge fully. I was even privileged enough to see his face turning blue as I left the scene with everything recorded on my phone.\n\n\nI started sending the videos all around school, and soon, everybody was doing the challenge. Four students were rushed to the hospital today alone. Two died on arrival, and the other two remain in critical condition, possibly brain dead. Or so my mother has heard anyway.\n\n\nTeachers are becoming suspicious now, they know about the videos, but they don't know who is uploading them, not yet anyway. I'm sure the police will find out soon enough\u2026\n\n\nBut until they do, I'll keep spreading the challenge around. And when the time does come, and the police have found me\u2026\n\n\nI'll finally attempt the challenge myself.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678230234.0,"comments":[{"author":"Scarabium","text":"This happened in a place near me, Southend-on-Sea, to a young boy of twelve.

We had just finished watching TV for the night as we would usually do since there wasn't much to talk about these days. I still remember the smash of the glass in the other room. \n\nWe thought it was the cat knocking something off the countertop. We were wrong. My father went to check and as soon as he was out of sight I heard a distinct fleshy thud followed by another thud. \n\nI got up and slowly made my way into the room to find two masked men standing over him holding what appeared to be hunting rifles. They saw me and dragged me by my hair and sat me next to my father.\n\nThey wanted to know where the money is. I told them I don't know. One of the men then placed his rifle on my father's temple and said I have 30 seconds to tell them where it is. I told them once again that I don't know where it is. \n\n20 \n\n10 \n\n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n\nA deafening bang filled the air and the sickly smell of copper infiltrated my nose.

Guilt quickly turned to hatred as I turn to look at the men. As I heard a click. \n\nI turn to find the barrel of the rifle pointed directly at me. \n\nI beg them not to do it. With a sick grin one of the men fires into my gut and then they leave. \n\nI'm typing this as a slowly bleed on the floor with my father's corpse.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678287056.0,"comments":[{"author":"Bugley15","text":"That was harsh!

Light and heat need to be produced and won't last forever if whatever is fueling them runs out. Then there is the darkness and cold which doesn't need to be produced, and is simply there till the end of time. Yes the cold at the same time can be produced by fridges, but it is also just there in the absence of heat. The darkness and cold are simply just there, which are never produced and will never run out. If there was no heat or light, the darkness and cold will have no problem just existing. What is creating or producing the darkness and cold? That is the true state of the universe. \n\nMy wife has always wanted to show what emotions I am showing through her face. I do not understand why and if I do not do this, then she will start to think that I am going to annihilate the whole family. So when I am annoyed or angry I would have to either punch or slap her, the power behind it would have to show my anger or annoyance. When I was angry the other day my wife wanted to show my emotion through her face. \n\nI had to punch her or otherwise she would start to think that I am going to annihilate the family. When she went outside and my wife showed everyone what I was feeling through her face, they knew that I was feeling angry. You know having my wife showing what I was feeling through her face, I had to really numb myself. I didn't like punching her or slapping her. So I started getting taught from a guy to never give a shit and I had to start pretending that I was a stranger to people that I knew, which was harder than I thought. \n\nHe would do stuff to people that I knew and I had to not care. As my wife was showing what I was feeling through her face, which was sometimes bruised or lumpy, or nothing at all, I thought that I was getting better at not caring any more. Then as a final test this man tested if I truly didn't give a shit by murdering my family and I think I passed. As my families bodies just layer on the ground, I started thinking about the true state of the universe. \n\nHow darkness and the cold don't need to be produced, sustained or maintained. Rather that the heat and light are the invaders. My families bodies are now going to be among darkness and the cold beneath the earth.

Tears welled up in his eyes.\n\n\u2026\n\n\nBen and his father sat down for dinner, with one empty chair looming over them. His father had never been a great cook, but made his best rendition of boxed mac and cheese with hot dogs. It used to be Ben\u2019s favorite, but after his mother passed, he hadn\u2019t been eating much.

Not well it seemed. \n\nHis father tried to cheer him up to no avail. \n\nBen felt like he was holding up the whole world just to not cry all the time. He would never play an xbox again if it just meant he could say goodbye to his mom one last time.\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u201cThanks for saying nothing in front of Jimmy. Now he thinks I\u2019m an idiot.

In the shoe box was the .32 revolver. Terrified, he stood, extended a limp arm, and squeezed the trigger firing a shot in his father\u2019s thigh.\n\nThe shot was so loud he dropped the gun.\n\nHis father jolted awake with a haunting scream. Ben started bawling and yelling, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! He told me I had to! He told me!\u201d\n\nHis father was in shock. Ben had hit an artery. \u201cBenny,\u201d he got out, \u201cwho told you?

That this behaviour allowed moisture from your breath to breed with your sweat, and let the damp reign supreme. That spending all that time in the darkness was the sign of an unhealthy mind. \n\nHer generation never understood how much entertainment exists within four walls. How if you lacked a job, and the concept of travel was an unthinkable horror, then an infinite pool of videos became your duvet honeypot. \n\nSo even on the hottest days of the year I kept the blinds down, and the lights off.  Thin slits of light made failed attempts to break in around the doorframe, but this was my sole disturbance from the glow of the screen.\n\nFun is not the right word. Instead the hours powered along under a thrum of visual satisfaction. A constant stream of calm that kept the world elsewhere. \n\nBut Mum had been right. Sometimes I mopped the windowsill with an old sock, and gathered enough water to fill a small glass.  After a brief adventure to shower or raid the fridge, my cave hit me with a reminder of humid, salty air. Black fingers of mould scratched the corners of the ceiling. \n\nAnd then one day my new companion joined me.\n\nSomehow they opened the door.\n\nThey are mostly bones. A rotting hoodie and pair of grimy beige shorts provide some kind of outfit, and white patches of limescale ossify their clothes and limbs. Stalactites hang from the chin of the skull. \n\nFor a long time they were little more than a shadow in the far corner, head down, arms wrapped around stick legs. I tried to say hello once, but all it has ever done is nod. Experimental plates of food left by their skeletal fingers remain untouched. \n\nNow they have more of a solid presence. Milky patches cling onto the carpet around their sodden trainers, and fuzzy patches run up the wall around their shoulders. I woke up at three in the morning the other day, and watched them not move. The tiniest dip of the head was their sole gesture of greeting. \n\nMum has stopped trying to get me to open the windows. The video keeps going, and I never move my laptop from its position. We can both watch. \n\nSometimes the entertainment gets repetitive. Much of the style and the content is so similar. We can spend fifteen minutes looking for new material, and fail on this simple quest. \n\nI remember there were some pleasant places outside. The library. The milkshake shop. Watching the clouds in the park on a summer\u2019s day. \n\nYesterday I found green marks on the back of my pillow. My nose is blocked most of the time. \n\nI do not mind.

It was thickly overgrown with vines and based on my studies in New England history, it had to be at least pre-colonial.\n\nNaturally my little brother being an eight-year-old menace climbed up on top of the vines that crisscrossed over the opening and looked down.\n\n\"I can't even see the bottom\", he shouted. I could hear his statement echo from down the well. \n\n\"Get down from there - I'm not interested in pulling you up from a bottomless pit today\", I said, half-jokingly, half-older-brotherly.\n\nWe heard what sounded like a growl from deep down in the well and he turned to look at me, just as the vines snapped and he plummeted down.\n\nMy whole body tensed up and he screamed for what felt like five minutes before punctuating his descent with an \"oof\" and a wail of anguish.\n\n\"Are you okay\"? I shouted as I moved vines away and squinted into the dark. After a moment he shouted up, \" I broke my arm - the bone punched through my skin. Oh God, can't move it!\"\n\n\"Hey, it's okay man! It'll be okay - I know it sucks but you could have died,\" I said. I talked him through deep breaths and calmed him down.\n\nI pulled out my phone and luckily I had a signal. I called our father who contacted rescue and stated that they would be out as soon as humanly possible and continued talking to my brother.\n\n\"It's so huge here and filled with cold water\", he said. He didn't have a phone so there was no light, but after a few more moments of him describing the sense he had of the space, he stopped talking. \" I think there's something down here with me\", he whisper-shouted.\n\nThen he screamed before I could even respond.\n\nI shouted down the well for the next several minutes until I heard the cacophony of rescuers pushing their way through the forest towards us. My brother shouted up that he had just been startled and he was okay. The rescue team descended on a rope and in quick form they brought him up to the surface.\n\nSomething was off however when they set him down on the ground. I couldn't put my finger on it and I realized that he had just had a fairly significant ordeal but his eyes looked different. He looked at me and joked \" stop staring at me! Weirdo\" and then pushed me away from him with both hands, hard.

After a long morning of sitting in the blinds with his ass going numb, the beautiful white-tailed deer almost looked like a mirage at first glance. He rubbed his eyes and looked again, this time through the scope of his Remington 870 Super Mag.\n\nSure as shit, there it was. Two-hundred pounds of walking venison, right into his lap at the last second. Immaculate hazel fur with a white shine, fully grown and fattened for the season.\n\nFeeling his heart pound in his chest, Rick stifled his excitement and focused on the kill. Slowly and carefully he shouldered the slug gun, each movement delicate and precise. He looked down the scope and lined up the shot, positioning the crosshair steadily like he had done dozens of times before. Just as the doe stopped to sniff the air, his finger hovered over the trigger. \n\nA single shot, right behind the deer\u2019s front leg.\n\nThe three inch slug dropped the deer immediately, and the gunshot echoed over miles of dead woods. A perfect shot, and an assumedly painless end. Rick looked up from the smoking gun, to see the doe already motionless on the ground.\n\nWhat a turn of events. Rick ejected the spent casing, his head already swimming with thoughts of venison steaks and hot sticks. It would be enough to fill the freezer, for sure. Just as he was about to set the shotgun down he stopped, an uneasy feeling creeping over him as he looked ahead.\n\nThe deer was moving, strangely. Slow at first, followed by jerky, delayed thrashes.\n\nRick watched the deer cautiously from the blinds, waiting for it to pass. Death throes weren\u2019t uncommon in a kill, but these seemed\u2026 *different.* The shot was true, though. It wouldn\u2019t be long until it was over.\n\nWithout a sound the deer got back up and looked around, seemingly unphased. It blinked lazily and twitched, even as the bloom of the gunshot wound oozed into the grass. Even as its right front leg fell away from its body. \n\n*What the fuck\u2014* Rick thought, shouldering the gun again to look through the scope. The deer awkwardly hobbled to look the other way, like it was looking for who shot it. Rick felt a twist of sickness when he saw the other side of it, a side that looked much less beautiful than the other.\n\nThe hide of the deer was covered in horrid bite marks, where many pieces had been ripped away crudely. The deer\u2019s other eye was cloudy\u2013infected, a coagulated stream oozing as it looked in his direction.\n\nRick wanted to take the shot, but couldn\u2019t. For he wasn\u2019t looking at the deer now, but *everything else* in the trees behind it.\n\nA limping mangy coyote, missing half of its face.\n\nA human man, shambling from the bushes with a missing arm.\n\nSeveral, half-eaten squirrels.\n\nAll around him, the trees began to stir.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678156097.0,"comments":[{"author":"psyopticnerve","text":"How the turntables...","upvotes":50,"created_utc":1678158914.0},{"author":"lutherleo","text":"\"Deer god\" he said to himself","upvotes":46,"created_utc":1678164461.0},{"author":"WhiskeredWolf","text":"I like that all of the creatures had a shared theme of being half eaten! it makes me think of supernatural things instead of just being a zombie disease.","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1678179758.0},{"author":"A_Hawaiian_Shirt","text":"For more deer of the gore variety, check out my [sub](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/HawaiianShirtFiction\/comments\/s1rwfv\/online_story_archive\/)","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1678156188.0},{"author":"NewlyNerfed","text":"Freaky!

I never noticed or was really bothered by her child like ways. She grew up in a single parent house hold and her father raised her all on his own. She was really fun to be with and we were both the same age, which was 35 years of age. I met her father who looked to be 70, but I didn't ask him his age, but he was definitely around that age. He looked so old and I guess taking care of children does that to you. \n\nAnyhow as our relationship progressed and became more serious, her child like behaviour became more irritant. She would complain and cry about everything, and she would expect me to fix it all. I was still with her at this point and if there was anything I couldn't fix, then she would call her father. Then one day she wanted me to cook her something but I needed to get to work. She started crying like a child. She called her father and when her father came, it was a different man who looked to be about in his 60s. I assumed her father was in a gay relationship. \n\nI was kinda annoyed that she didn't tell me about her father's gay relationship and that I had to find out like this. As months went by I started getting better at doing what she wanted and fixing things whenever she wanted something fixing. I read her stories before she went to bed and I didn't notice that she was calling me father. I told her that I wasn't her father but rather I was her boyfriend, and I seemed to have succumbed to more stress running around after my girlfriends needs. \n\nThen I started to call my girlfriend daughter at times, and I needed to remind myself that I was her boyfriend. I realised I was going out with a woman child. Then one day when I was arguing with her, about her child like behaviour, she started crying like a child. Then she called her father and the first two guys came, the one in the 70s and the other in his 60s, then a third man was there who was also her father. She had 3 fathers now? and I asked them their age, all 3 of them were in their 30s. \n\nThen my girlfriend confessed \"I use to go out with them, but because they ran around after me so much, it had aged them and now they think they are my fathers. I don't create future husbands but rather I create future fathers\" \n\nWhen I looked at myself in the mirror, I too had aged and I also saw my girlfriend as my daughter. When I saw the 3 guys hugging like a daughter, I too started hugging her like a daughter.

But being pregnant in the zombie apocalypse is an altogether different thing entirely. \nWhen Sarah first started having morning sickness, she was afraid she was dying. That her time had come. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much their doctor could do with the meager amount of medical supplies they had if one of their group got sick. But then her breasts started to hurt and her belly began to swell. For Sarah, this was even worse than dying. She didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. And crying babies attracted too much attention. How were they supposed to avoid detection from the living dead with a squalling babe in their midst? \n\nKevin, however, was ecstatic. He couldn\u2019t wait to be a father. He never seemed to be worried about anything. He was so brave. His joy quelled some of Sarah\u2019s fears, that was until he went out on an excursion for supplies with three other men and never came back. The two other men insisted that Kevin had saved them, had sacrificed himself so they could survive. If this was true, Sarah thought, then he was a coward after all. Leaving her to raise a child on her own. \n\nSix months in and she could feel the living being moving around inside her. Taking up more room than Sarah thought she had left in her abdomen. Then, one day, the moving stopped. Sarah was terrified. The moving stopped for an entire day. But when Sarah awoke the next morning after a night of worried, uncomfortable tossing and turning, the moving was back. Sarah wept. \n\nThree months later her time had come. The labor pains had started and the other women fawned over her, holding her hands and whispering reassurances. Their doctor was at her side for nearly 36 hours. At last, the time had come for that one final push. \n\nSarah pushed with all her might, and she felt the child evacuate from her body. The doctor took the child aside, but Sarah could hear its shrill cries. She\u2019d done it. The baby was here. The women all gathered around the doctor and the crying babe. A sudden hush fell over them. One of them turned to Sarah with tears in her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sarah. It\u2019s going to be ok. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re sorry?\u201d, Sarah shouted, \u201cWhat do you mean?!?\u201d The four other women turned towards her with grim faces.

Doctor Foster greets Phillip, and motions for Phillip to sit down.\n\n\u201cSo, Phillip, tell me what has brought you here today?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Doctor, all of my body parts\u2026feel kind of funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that Phillip?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, let me show you, Doctor.\u201d\n\nPhillip extends out a leg for Doctor Foster to look at.\n\n\u201cLook at this leg, Doctor. It just doesn\u2019t look right, and feel right.\u201d\n\nDoctor Foster runs his hand along the stretched out leg, stopping a few times to make notes on a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cYes, that does appear to be a bit strange Phillip. So what else is troubling you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this leg now Doctor. Look closely\u2026something just doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d\n\nDoctor Foster runs his hands along the second leg, again stopping a few times to make notes on a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cYes, there definitely is a problem with these two legs. But we only have two legs\u2026don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Doctor Foster.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Phillip, now that I have examined your legs, what else do you want me to look at?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better take a look at my arms doctor\u2026they look quite strange to me.\u201d\n\nDoctor Foster grabs a magnifying glass from inside a drawer. With Phillip, he wanted to make no mistakes. Doctor Foster first grabs the left arm, looking closely at every mark, dent, even hair. Phillip then extends the right arm for Doctor Foster. Again, Doctor Foster does a thorough examination of the arm. After this, the doctor puts away the magnifying glass, picks up a pen, and writes some notes on a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cOk, Phillip. I have looked at both legs, and both arms, and while there are some abnormalities, I do not see anything inherently wrong with them all. So, is there anything else you want me to look at?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Doctor, could you look at my head?\u201d\n\nAt this point, Phillip stretches out his head for the Doctor, but the Doctor instead gets up and motions Phillip towards the door.\n\n\u201cLook, I inspected your arms, and your legs. But there is no way I am looking at your head. Now put that head back in the bag with the other body parts, and leave.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678175660.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheFinalGranny","text":"Oh snap!","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678195450.0}]},{"title":"Chocolates in the Office","author":"Hack_Shuck","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11kga73\/chocolates_in_the_office\/","text":"None of the workers knew who had brought the box of chocolates into the office one Monday morning. The chocolates didn\u2019t last long. Some workers ate three or four, leaving none for others.\n\nMore chocolates were waiting the next day. Speculation regarding the mysterious benefactor ran wild. One kindly, quiet older worker named Gus, who often saved up his small sugar rations to bake cookies for everyone to share, didn\u2019t deny that he had brought the chocolates into the office. Gus was starved of attention and affection since his wife died. Gus cried a little; he could remember what real chocolate had tasted like.\n\nBy Wednesday, workers were no longer wasting any time guessing who kept bringing in the boxes of chocolates, as they were too busy fighting to get to them. One poor worker was trampled almost to death.\n\nEarly on Thursday, management confiscated the chocolates in the name of safety. There was very nearly a riot; the chocolates were returned, untouched.\n\nBy Friday, workers chomped and chewed on the chocolates with a massive sadness, as they knew that they would not be eating chocolates all weekend.\n\nIndeed, that weekend felt like an eternity. On Monday, workers arrived early, shivering and jittery, chewing on the inside of their sallow cheeks, frantic to eat more of the chocolates. But there WERE no more chocolates that day. Workers were distraught, disconsolate. Some comforted each other, sobbing and rocking. Some screamed in discordant rage. Most viewed Gus with violent eyes. The rumor resurfaced that Gus had once been a troublemaker, a rabble-rouser perhaps. Someone who stood up for others. All that night, death threats were shouted from every angle all around into his small, stifling subterranean cell.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were no chocolates and no Gus, as he had died by apparent suicide. \u201cGood riddance,\u201d many workers said. Someone defaced the metal desk, where the old man had worked for seventy-seven years, with the words \u201cBURN IN HELL\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, there were chocolates again. The box was practically torn apart, as if half-starved arctic wolves fought over a scrawny half-gnawed carcass. Workers licked little scraps of cardboard until it dissolved on their ulcerous tongues. Management watched, with interest.\n\nOn Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday there were chocolates in the office.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678141696.0,"comments":[{"author":"WalmartGreder","text":"nice little clues to a dystopian future where sugar is rationed.  \n\nAnd this is why you don't admit to anything, good or bad.","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678146636.0},{"author":"SadMaryJane","text":"BRILLIANT.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678335510.0},{"author":"TinyATuin","text":"What a wonderfully constructed dystopia.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678348503.0}]},{"title":"My Pen Pal","author":"ForgottenWell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11k4ind\/my_pen_pal\/","text":"There were complications during my birth.

It shouldn\u2019t have upset me so much, but I started crying. I reached into the sink, accidentally grabbed a knife, and cut myself.\n\nPapa grabbed me by the arm and screamed at me for getting blood everywhere. He threw me in my room and told me not to come out.\n\nI was upset\u2026 I had to air out my feelings somehow.\n\nI grabbed my notebook. \u201cTo whom it may concern,\u201d I wrote, blood dripping down my hand.

That way I can also get the photo just the way I want it.\n\nMost people never really look at the photos because they\u2019re too enamored with the damn font. A corporate logo. The ones that do look, see a photo of a child wearing mouse ears.       \n\nThey always walk away unsettled, but they\u2019re not sure why. \n\nMaybe it's because the smiles on the kids are just a little too forced, or maybe it's because they\u2019re eyes look bright yet somehow lifeless.

I didn\u2019t know anything about it, like how they would meet twice a week at 7:00-8:30 at night or how the bullies who lived across the street from the main entrance liked to hang out there at that time of night. To avoid them, I walked the entire way through the school to get to the other exits. That meant walking through the wide, empty halls of lockers.\n\nI hated the silence, the uniformity, the florescent lights, the sheer uninterrupted distance, that feeling that stabbed me while walking, sometimes running, down those halls. It was the same dark feeling as having something sharp and fast slither on your leg in deep water.\n\nI heard what sounded like a lock being lifted and dropped after one meeting. I followed the sound only to hear it stop and start again somewhere else. Another night, I heard what sounded like something rifling through the things inside the closed locker.\n\nOne good thing is that I met Izzy in that club. She was shy, cute and small compared to my tall, gangly frame. We made a cute couple. Sometimes we would walk together to avoid the bullies, and on rare occasions, she walked with me through the locker hall with me up until Izzy heard what sounded like heavy breathing coming from one of the lockers and refused to walk down the halls anymore, taking her chances with the bullies.\n\nThe halls became worse when I was walking alone again; it seemed like the noises were coming from everywhere as I ran down them. I wished Izzy was with me during those times, especially when I saw one of the locker doors violently rattling with an angry, almost feral groan coming from within.\n\nMy fear could have made me to hear strange things, but I knew without a doubt that this was real. I could have ran back and got someone to show them what was happening. I could have. Instead, I ran.\n\nA crew of emergency vehicles were parked in front of the school the next morning. A covered stretcher slowly slid into an ambulance. A bully was in hand-cuffs and two more where in the back of a police car.\n\nSome friends told me that the morning crew found Izzy shoved into one of the lockers; she was small enough to fit. She had tape around her mouth, and she spent the night kicking the locker door and screaming before she died of \u201ccardiac arrest\u201d; no one ever explained why a healthy girl\u2019s heart would stop like it did.

Her eyes... they turned dark. Without words, or a change in expression, she'd stare at my eyes and drill her thunder into me through her pinhole pupils. It's the most frightening thing I've ever seen. And once we got home, she made me shower with my clothes on and then sleep outside so I'd know to not accidentally drop things.\n\nThat's love.\n\nAnd 'hatred' is when you message someone every day, asking how they're doing and if they'd like to hang out together. Like my dad used to. Mom said not to trust his tricks, because he's just sweet-talking to hide the depth of his hatred towards me.\n\nI like hatred much more than love. But since mom said dad's just trying to hurt me, I had to stay in her loving home, and keep going to that school where they loved me very much.\n\nThat's where the big boys jumped on me \u2013 literally \u2013 until my arm turned blue. Mom said that's how boys show friendship. Then she twisted that same arm until it cracked, and I was momentarily blinded by the pain. \"See, it doesn't even hurt you. So stop whining.\"\n\nIt feels weird to say I 'love' my mom, because the movies still use that filthy word as if it was something good. There's nothing good about mom. But knowing what 'love' really means, I can only say I truly, deeply loved her.\n\nAnd it was time to show it.\n\nIt was really easy, even with only one arm left. I just had to wait until she was asleep. Then I drilled her loving face full of loving holes, with the biggest blade our drill had. It was 8 mm, by the way, meant for brick walls but worked just fine for mom's skull. She stopped screaming halfway through the first hole, but I kept drilling as many as her face could fit. That's how much I loved her.\n\nThey still didn't let me live with dad, though. In fact, I just heard two of them talking about me.\n\n\u201dHe really said that?\u201d\n\n\u201dThat's right, I wrote it down: '*I can't feel love anymore. Now that mom's gone, I can rebuild the hatred I've always wanted to fill my life with'*. And he said my 'psychology tricks' won't change his mind.\u201d\n\n\u201dJesus Christ, that kid belongs in an institution. We can't waste our resources on someone like him.\u201d\n\n\u201dPoor woman.

Then, she flicked a switch, and an image of a handsome smiling young man glowed on a screen behind the table. \u201cAnd here is your Adonis, before he donated flesh. Enjoy your meal!\u201d She bowed, and turned away.\n\nCarly frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s so creepy how they say \u201cdonated\u201d. It\u2019s mandatory, right?\u201d\n\nDad patted her hand. \u201cJust biz talk sweetie. Of course it is. And they get six weeks of free food and board!\u201d \n\nSix weeks of carefully regulated diet and exercise ensured the human flesh was suitable for consumption with no contamination- after all, homeless people were not known for their healthy lifestyles. The restaurant industry was lobbying hard to shorten the length of time candidates had to be boarded and fed before they were harvested, bringing in expert witnesses to testify that in most cases, human flesh was perfectly safe and clean within three weeks, but recent health scares and epidemics delayed rulings. \n\nDad sighed. Shorter boarding times would mean lower costs, and more meals out. Family was so much more manageable when they ate out together. \n\nAnyway, tonight was about Carly. He beamed fondly at his family, all now reaching out and carefully manouvering their chopsticks to pick up the luscious pieces of sushi and dip it in the pretty small platters of gleaming black-brown soy sauce. \u201cEat up! And congratulations on Carly\u2019s graduation!!\u201d \n\nEverybody paused, the chopsticks still. \u201cCongratulations Carly!\u201d \n\nCarly flushed with pleasure. She had made it through. \n\nBut Mom always had to complain. It was so embarrassing going out with her - she made a fuss about everything. Everything had to be about her. God forbid Carly be the spotlight for one second. \n\nNow Mom paused mid-chew. Dad looked at her, worried. If Mom wasn\u2019t happy, no-one was going to be happy. And there went several hundred down the drain for one meal. \u201cWhat is it hun? Sushi ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you have a piece?\u201d \n\n\u201cNot yet- why?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tastes fine- only-\u201d she glanced at the image beside them\u2013 \u201cI swear it is a woman. Not a man. I have such sensitive tastebuds- I can tell the difference. And you know I refuse to consume women\u2019s flesh. Street women-\u201c her voice fell. \n\n\u201cI know\u201d said Dad. Mom had been an anti-sex-work activist during college, and twenty years on, still kept those beliefs. Although both homeless men and women were farmed into the Human Sushi program, Mom believed homeless women mostly engaged in sex work and on principle, refused to consume their flesh. \n\nMom put down her chopsticks and sat stiffly. Carly and Dad exchanged glances. It was going to be a long evening.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678103647.0,"comments":[{"author":"Maliagirl1314","text":"This would make a great YA dystopian novel ;)\nI'd read it!","upvotes":50,"created_utc":1678106568.0},{"author":"Contrariwise2","text":"I'm curious.

Stacy was standing at the foot of your bed, her eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.\n\nYou tried to scream, but no sound escaped your lips. You tried to run, but your legs wouldn't move. You were paralyzed, trapped in the grip of a terror that was beyond anything you had ever experienced.\n\nStacy stepped closer, and you could feel her cold breath on your face. She whispered to you in a voice that was both beautiful and terrifying. \"I have been waiting for you,\" she said. \"I have been waiting for someone to play with.\"\n\nAnd then, you were no longer alone in the room. The darkness seemed to come alive, and you felt yourself being pulled into a nightmare from which there was no escape.

Once you feel that, though, it\u2019s always too late. The tingling quickly spreads up the arms, as the fingers turn fully numb.\n\nWhile you never notice it the first time, after the numbness starts to spread, you also lose your senses of taste, smell, and often hearing. Over the course of a few seconds, other things go as well. Your peripheral vision turns grey, then fades into blackness.\n\nAt the end of this process, you can only really perceive your target. Of course, you never notice this in the thick of it, and while this may have its downsides, those are mitigated by the fact that your target ends up as a pile of mulch. Then you come down from the high, feeling slowly spreads back to the rest of your body, and you head off to grab a snack.\n\nOf course, from an outside perspective, it looks different. Generally speaking you aren\u2019t meant to watch a spellcaster when at all possible, and most people who see the process don\u2019t remember it, but occasionally a long-range microphone or analogue camera will observe and retain a part of the process. These recordings are exceptionally hard to find.\n\nIf you were to watch a video of a spellcaster at work, you\u2019d see them walk forward and close their eyes. Then, over the course of a few seconds, starting at their fingertips and spreading right to their chest, their skin begins to twist and coil off their body like peeling an apple. Something dark and slender, worming underneath, glows brighter and brighter, until whatever they were looking at turns itself inside out. And, just as quickly as it started, they settle back into whatever they think of as their own body. And they head off to grab a snack.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678105426.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Insomniac","author":"throwfalseaway","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11k6uz4\/the_insomniac\/","text":"It was a dark night, rain was pouring heavily and I was lying in my bed trying hard to sleep. The thunderstorm and the nefarious darkness was enough to send jitters and took me back to the memory when I saw a black man staring at me from the window on a thunderous night. Black not as in skin colour but what you see in a dark night sky. He held something similar to scythe in his hand. He broke the window and came in just when I woke up all sweaty and\n\nSigh... just a dream, I calmed my heaving chest. Strange, I remember reading the news of an ancient scythe being stolen from the local museum. It looked similar to what I saw in my dream. Just a dream, I got up to get ready for work when I realised how wrong I was as I saw my family lying in a pool of blood. I tried waking them up, all in vain. I ran to grab my phone from my room and there he was at the same window, with an eerie grin on his face pointing at something behind me. I turned back to find the same scythe like blade dripping with blood. Now I was too scared to do anything but run away. No thought of calling the police or ambulance. I was just worried for myself so I grabbed something while running, don't remember what. I don't know what got into me and why I did not ask my neighbours for help as I kept running and collapsed at a faraway bus stand. Everyone at the bus stand must have thought I was sleeping because no one bothered to ask me what was wrong.\n\nStill raining with a thunderstorm, that man's figure flashed again for a moment because of a lightning bolt. This time he was not carrying his blade but a baseball bat. I looked around only to find everyone at the bus stand dead. Frightened to death, this time I ran and did not stop before reaching the police station. The cops immediately felt something was very wrong since they looked worried themselves, and again I phased out for some time.\n\nOh dear God! I exclaimed \"Why is death tracing my footsteps\" because everyone at the station was either shot in the head or strangled to death some moments later. A large backup force arrived quickly at the scene. I ran to them only to be slammed to the ground and arrested. That bastard stood smiling in a corner during interrogation. Nobody believed my story or paid heed to that man. Soon the CCTV footage from the bus stand and the police station came which showed me running with a baseball bat.\n\nInsomnia finally got to my head. A baseball bat was what I grabbed while running away from my home. Sitting by a window at the asylum I still remember that day whenever it rains at night.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678124845.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Who Will Take Care Of Him When I'm Gone?","author":"therealdocturner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11j6pbi\/who_will_take_care_of_him_when_im_gone\/","text":" \n\nHe\u2019s been having nightmares. He won\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m seventy and I\u2019m dying. Who will take care of him when I\u2019m gone?\n\nHe\u2019s eating so much now that I\u2019m struggling to keep up with the demand. He still eats like a baby. All the time.\n\nHe\u2019s forty five, but his ability to communicate is on the level of someone who is two. A forever child who will never change. It\u2019s not his fault. He deserves a good life just like anyone else. The best one I can give him. The second I laid eyes on him, I loved him.\n\nI watch him toddle around the playground. All the kids out there tolerate him, and do their best to play around him. I watch him carefully; I have to. I\u2019m always afraid that he might hurt someone accidently, or worse, intentionally. He can have a temper, but for the most part he\u2019s a sweet boy. \n\nThe Christmas lights are up and it warms the night. I love Christmas. I enjoy this one because it\u2019s going to be my last. Stage 4 inoperable. Way it goes. The doctor says I have less than six months. I stare at my baby. Who will take care of him when I\u2019m gone?\n\nI fed him before we came. He\u2019s more social that way. He squeals and laughs. He falls down a couple of times, but he always gets back up on his own.\n\nSome of the other parents talk with me. Swapped stories of our children and Christmas wishes. \n\nWe stay long after everyone is gone. I let him run himself ragged. He\u2019s angry when I tell him that we have to go, and he runs from me. It\u2019s getting to the point where I can\u2019t keep up with him anymore.\n\nI feed him and then I pull down all the shades in the house and tell him it\u2019s bedtime. I have to strap him in his bed now so he doesn\u2019t come out of the room and hurt himself. He\u2019s already broken through ropes, so now I use tie down straps.\n\nHe can be a handful. He doesn\u2019t know his own strength when he gets angry. \n\nI read him a story. He loves Despereaux. I stroke his hair and give him a kiss and let him sleep.\n\nI wake up to screams. He\u2019s out of his room and he\u2019s managed to burn himself. I tackle him and carry him back to his room as fast as I can. \n\nI do the only thing that will heal the burns; I feed him again. I make a small incision on my left arm and let him suck on it. The burns fade and he falls asleep.\n\nI sleep with him and dream. I dream of when I found him crying in his crib; his parents' bloodless bodies on the floor. He was bitten; left behind as a cruel joke by a monster. He still deserved a life.\n\nWho will take care of him when I\u2019m gone?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678040847.0,"comments":[{"author":"AlwaysAvalable","text":">Who will take care of him when I\u2019m gone?\n\nwooden stake","upvotes":94,"created_utc":1678052190.0},{"author":"cometlin","text":"Brilliant twist, deserve second reading to get all the hints and little nods.

Six hours had to have been too long, yet the car kept going with no end in sight. Asking my parents about the matter had been a lost cause, as they merely brushed me off and told me we'd stop \"soon.\" That had been nearly an hour and a half ago, and we still hadn't pulled into a rest stop. But that no longer seemed to matter since we hadn't seen any in about... five and a half hours.\n    That was unquestionably far too long without civilization. It didn't help that there wasn't a single vehicle on the road for miles, nor was it helpful to know that we were smack dab in the middle of nowhere. We were positively in the sticks, so far out that it seemed incredibly unlikely we'd ever see another human again. But that was just a silly notion, nothing more than an afterthought in the wasteland that was this highway.\n    And I held on to that thought, even as the sun began to set and the bright summer skies gave way to sparkling darkness.

I spend most of my free time reading up on ghost stories and watching horror movies. But little did I know that my obsession with the supernatural would lead me to experience something that would terrify me to my core.\n\nIt all started when I decided to take a solo trip to a small town in the countryside. The town was famous for its haunted house, which had been abandoned for years. The locals believed that the house was cursed and that anyone who entered it would never come out alive.\n\nBeing the curious person that I am, I couldn't resist the temptation of exploring the haunted house. I arrived at the house just as the sun was setting, and as soon as I stepped inside, I felt a cold breeze brush past me. I shrugged it off, thinking it was just the wind, but as I walked deeper into the house, I felt a growing sense of unease.\n\nThe air was thick with an oppressive energy, and I could feel something watching me. Suddenly, I heard a faint whisper that seemed to be coming from all around me. I couldn't make out what it was saying, but the voice was definitely not human.\n\nI tried to leave the house, but the door was locked, and I couldn't find the key. I was trapped inside with whatever was lurking in the shadows. I felt a chill run down my spine as I heard footsteps approaching me. They were slow and deliberate, and as they got closer, I could see a figure emerging from the darkness.\n\nIt was a woman, or at least it looked like one. But her face was twisted into a grotesque mask of pain, and her eyes were black as coal. She floated towards me, her long hair trailing behind her, and I could hear her voice whispering in my ear.\n\nI don't remember much after that. All I know is that I woke up outside the house, covered in scratches and bruises. I never went back to that town again, and I stopped reading about the paranormal altogether. I learned my lesson the hard way - some things are better left alone.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678058894.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Pool Party","author":"Spongebob_Sp050199","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11jda97\/the_pool_party\/","text":"You hear that your best friend is throwing a pool party at his house as a friend get-together. You are excited to go and spend time with old childhood friends. You put on your best bathing suit and start heading over to your friend's house. When you get there, you notice that the pool is huge, about 25 ft. long. You notice that there is a barbecue going, with food such as burgers, hotdogs, beer, soda, etc. There's music blaring from two speakers on either side of the back sliding doors. Everyone seems like they're having an amazing time. \n\nYou're swimming in the pool while your friends are dipping their feet in the pool while they eat and drink. One of your friends eventually challange you to hold your breath underwater as long as you can. You accept the challenge, and take in a deep breath before submerging yourself underwater. You can hear your friends cheering you on, so you open your eyes to look up at them. This is a saltwater pool, so you can do that. You look up and see an unfamiliar figure standing behind your friends while staring down at you. You're confused on who it is, so you come up early and look back up to see who the person is. They aren't there anymore. 'That's weird...' You think to yourself.\n\nYour friends dare you to go back under, so duck under again, not bothering to mention the figure since it was gone anyway. When you open your eyes again, you can see the same person in the deep end on the pool. Only it wasn't swimming, it was standing on the pool floor, fully clothed in casual clothing (t-shirt, jeans, tennis shoes) rather than a bathing suit. You're very confused now, but you try to swim closer to see who the figure is. You have to come up for a breath, however, so you re-emerge.\n\nWhen you wipe the water off of your face and look around, you notice you're all alone. The music is turned off, the food and drinks and gone, the grill is put away, all the lights are off, and everyone is gone. It's as if everyone forgot about you and finished up the party and left. You don't know how they could've forgotten you, especially since you couldn't have been underwater long enough for them to put everything away.

I asked Father many times. He hated it.\n\nBut one night, I picked up the courage to ask. My thumb and finger twirled the thorn needle nervously as he glared at me like an angry bull.\n\n\"No!\" he said, slamming the mug upon the table surface. \"How many damned times did I tell you *not* to mention her?\"\n\nThe angry face Father showed me was enough to silence me. He got up and limped his way to the door. I reached for his shoulder, to steady him, as his bad leg had always caused trouble.\n\n\"Don't touch me!\" He slapped my hand. \"Go away!\"\n\nI took a step back, my hand partially on my mouth, eyes wide. Poor man. He hadn't been the same since Mother disappeared. The villagers had told tales of that event for years. \n\nOne story told of Mother going to the sunflower fields for harvest and that she disappeared from sight. Another told she was eaten by wolves which lurked in the forest nearby. Because of these stories, I couldn't tell which was true.\n\nI sighed and went back to work on my embroidery, the candlelight glowing against the dark.\n\nSome time passed. I prepared for bed and stared in wonder at the Red Moon. What a beautiful round shape! At the last moment, I picked up a lost needle and I dropped it suddenly. A biting pain spread from my fingers, then to my entire hand, soon rendering me on the floor crying. My body was soon in pain, as if my bones were on fire.\n\nI called out for help and to my luck, the door opened. The room was suddenly alight with fire.\n\n\"Is this your daughter?\" A man looked at Father. \"Her?\"\n\nFather nodded, barely looking at me. I asked what's wrong.\n\nBut men surrounded me with chains, while some aimed at me with muskets. Before anything, however, I screamed as my hand became plant-like. My fingers became stem and leaves. My skin softened then hardened. My hair became vines. What was happening?\n\nThe men in the room stepped back as I rose to my feet. A volley of thick smoke only tickled me and amidst the following chaos, I broke free, free through the walls, using strength and roots I didn't know I had. \n\nOutside was a large loud mob, armed with flaming torches and weapons. I ran as far my roots took me, across the toiled fields to the sunflower one. My silhouette stretched in the light of the Red Moon as I crossed into the sunflowers and lowered myself. I prayed that I would blend in as villagers stomped along the path, their fires like a glowing worm in the air.\n\nNo sooner than they had passed did something leafy wrapped around my neck. And I looked up to see Mother's familiar face. Her eyes were yellow as gold and her neck was a mane of bloodied petals.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677973738.0,"comments":[{"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","text":"This is haunting EC.

It was a last request of Louie, who was being buried today. The funeral director guided me where to put the cases, and then I went inside, ready for the service to begin.\n\nThe service was lovely. The director started off with a poignant message of hope in the face of adversity, and then touched on what an unsung hero Louie was. Then came the people, who wanted to say something about Louie, and what sort of person he was.\n\nFirst up, was Louie\u2019s mother. She went through Louie\u2019s upbringing, and how the family never had much money. Despite failures and setbacks, Louie pushed through, not wanting to be slack, and working hard, eventually getting years of experience in customer service and sales, as well as obtaining a university degree.\n\nNext up, was Louie\u2019s close friend Angela. Angela spoke about about how she was once in a violent relationship, and was too scared to say anything. But Louie was always there to support her, and do whatever was needed to make sure she was safe. Following Angela was Carol, who talked about her days at university with Louie, and how once Louie dropped everything at 2am, just to calm her down and talk her out of suicide.\n\nBeverly came up to the podium, and spoke about how she always got great service from Louie in the supermarket Louie once worked at. She mentioned how Louie\u2019s attitude wasn\u2019t one that customer service is just part of a job, and how it came across as Louie actually caring about providing the best experience for every customer.\n\nA surprise to everyone was well known comedian Harry. Harry mentioned how Louie always treated him as a human being, with respect and dignity\u2026and not like the celebrity that most people treat him. Harry always enjoyed shopping wherever Louie worked, because it meant he could be himself, and not have to worry about media pressures. And following this was a story of the poor woman that Louie would often buy meals for, because she didn\u2019t have much money to live on.\n\nThe service wound up with one of Louie\u2019s favourite songs, and pictures of his life playing on the big screen. Guests were then ushered into a nearby reception hall, where everyone was given a can o cola\u2026the very cola I brought to the funeral. My instructions from Louie were to make sure everyone has a can of cola, and for someone to a toast. So, I made sure everyone had a cola, and the toast was done by Louie\u2019s wife.\n\nEveryone took a sip from the can of cola, and started choaking and spitting. Within seconds, people were falling to the floor, dead. I opened the last note I had from Louie, which read \u201cThese people made me miserable my entire life. They never helped, they never cared. So they can now suffer, like I did.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677982921.0,"comments":[{"author":"lalauna","text":"Okay, that was intense","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1678007497.0},{"author":"CompulsivePancakes","text":"Woah","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678034170.0},{"author":"Contrariwise2","text":"Did not see that coming","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678038197.0},{"author":"AlwaysAvalable","text":"NO NOT THE COMEDIAN","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678053285.0}]},{"title":"I heard knocks at my window throughout the whole night.","author":"Plus_Description_385","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11je3f7\/i_heard_knocks_at_my_window_throughout_the_whole\/","text":"I heard knocks at my window throughout my whole night, it happened on March 3rd, 2023.

The utterly unimpressive and uninspired plot repeating itself over and over and over. \n\nMy heart stopped racing. My fear plateaued.\n\nYears went on, me ingesting content that no longer frightened me, more so out of habit than enjoyment. Hours. Days. Reading, writing, watching a former love that did nothing for me. But then, upon my tenth viewing of my once favorite movie, it dawned on me. \n\nMichael. Freddy. Jason. These were the names remembered. They were the icons. The victims were secondary fodder to the real stars.\n\nEven going back to my brother whose laughter outpaced my scream when he first popped out from behind the couch, all those years ago. He offered something to me I knew I wanted to spread. Something scary. \n\nLeaving infected needles in gas stations or theater seats? \n\nInserting small pieces of glass and razor blades into Halloween candy? \n\nWatching, lurking, then working on my neighbor's dog, writing in its blood that humans can lick too? \n\nTracking a curious audience wanting to read something scary by loading their digital profile in my database of future recipients?\n\nIt was back.

That\u2019s it\u2019s not normal to eat so much candy the way that I do. That my voracious appetite for it makes me a monster. \n\nOne type of candy is thin and fine. It\u2019s so sweet on the tongue. So many fine hairs that gather in little puffs of saccharine goodness when you pinch some of it off. I absolutely adore it. \n\nSome candy is hard and crunchy. Tiny little white squares. Oh god, I love this kind. There\u2019s even a sweet little filling on the inside once you crunch through the outer shell. Delicious! \n\nThere\u2019s another kind that comes in a sweet gummy little ball. There are few different colors, but I like them all! It just pops in your mouth! So juicy! \n\nAnother is runny and red and thick and oh so very sweet! It\u2019s like a drink and I can slurp it up all day long. It really quenches the thirst and coats the tongue. \n\nI have to be very careful when acquiring my candy. There\u2019s always people who try to stop me from getting it.

Some of them were never found. Those that survived spoke of a green fairy -- a strange, but consistent story, even among children from different schools whose families were strangers.\n\nCaptain Giordano and Sergeant Baker were staking out Giordano's own house, where his two kids slept in the second-story bedroom. The adults hid in a closet and wardrobe in the room. Two lieutenants were in a parked van. A crescent moon peeked behind scattered clouds. This was day 11 of the stakeout. Not putting his kids at risk; just protecting them.\n\nThe radio broke the silence. \"Captain! Someone's at the window! He just appeared!\"\n\n\"Copy that, we see him.\" Giordano kept the volume low, and the wardrobe door cracked open. Someone was outside, on the second floor, somehow opening a locked window and letting himself in. Wearing: a short dress? of dark feathers, or maybe scales. Slender build. He hopped through, landed on his tiptoes. The kids were waking up.\n\n\"Hello, children,\" said the intruder. \"Would you like to have some fun?\"\n\nBaker came out first, in Weaver stance, shouting: \"On the floor, hands above your head!\"\n\nThe intruder smiled. \"You can put down your gun, and your badge. No one is too old to play.\"\n\nGiordano watched Baker stoop down and lay his sidearm on the floor. As if hypnotized, that fast. Giordano wasn't about to give him another chance. He eased the wardrobe door open, took aim, and fired two shots in the intruder's chest.\n\n\"Daddy, whyyy?\" his own children cried. He walked up to the fallen intruder, who was dressed like a fairy: ballet slippers, pale green tights, the feather\/scale dress, and... green hair.\n\n\"Our... island... is filled with. With women,\" the fairy said, choking back blood. \"I know the kind you like.\"\n\nGiordano stood over him, taking aim at his forehead, but paused as the fairy's form seemed to flicker. To change into something else. He figured it out. The creature had a disguise, a glamour, but in death it was wearing off. There were no clothes. The body was scaly and leafy, a serpent\/kelp sort of thing. Its mouth was like the legs of a spider. It had a dragonfly's wings. It had only one eye.\n\n\"What the f...\" Baker caught himself. There were small kids present.\n\nSomething buzzed at Giordano's head, a large insect. He swatted at it, missed, and grabbed a skinny hardcover book off the kids' dresser. His next attempt connected, and the insect fell to the floor. It sat there, moving feebly, perhaps stunned. He stared at it.\n\nThe bug was the size of his fist, with an ant's segmented body of iridescent green. Its legs were pale white, looking more like skin than shell. And its head... its head almost looked like...\n\nHe raised a boot and crushed it.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677973208.0,"comments":[{"author":"tillie_jayne","text":"I thought it was going to be about a cuckoo with the reference to the bird and the children being \u2018pushed out of the nest\u2019 so to speak.

I remember how it crawled up my wall and watched me from the corner of my ceiling, with its black mouth hanging open, which made the pale skin on its face look even paler. I remember the way it never blinked, and how it wriggled down my wall and out of my window before the sun came up.\u00a0\n\nThis happened two times. The second time it happened, I was asleep. A muffled groan awakened me. I remember opening my eyes and staring at my dolphin nightlight, not wanting to look up at my ceiling, for fear of it being there, watching me. I remember clutching onto my sheets until my fingernails dug into my palm.\n\nI remember the groaning.\u00a0\n\nI pried my eyes from the light, gazed over my cloud-covered walls and up my closet door. I saw its hind leg. The groaning grew softer. I finally looked at it\u2014its eyes still dull and cloudy, its black mouth still gaping. Its pale, veiny abdomen quivered. I remember\u00a0seeing something underneath its skin. An outline of a face, a little boy\u2019s face, pushing out. I remember watching his little mouth open and close, as if from behind a sheet, until it finally stopped. The groaning stopped, too.\u00a0\n\nJust like before, before the sun rose, it left.\n\nI felt\u2014no, I *knew*\u2014that if I ever saw it again, it would take me. Just like it took that little boy.\n\nI remember my parents not believing me until they saw that putrid stain that led from my window to my ceiling. I remember how fast we moved to the new house.\n\n\u00a0I remember my childhood room after all these years, and after all these new bedrooms, because, as I write this, those pale eyes are back at my window and staring at me.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677987853.0,"comments":[{"author":"Professional_Box817","text":"You better have everything locked this time bro man you need some turrets","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678071579.0},{"author":"Resident-Evil31415","text":"I'm disturbed...

I am not a *stand on the street looking expectantly at the sky* kind of person, but I do definitely believe that the Bible is true and all the things it predicts in Revelation will happen: the trumpet will sound, and the dead in Christ will rise, and the new Heaven and new Earth will come. Well, I did until my Pastor died. \n\n  \nMy best friend was the daughter of the Pastor at the church I attended. Her dad was a great scholar and a devoted man of God. When he died, it fell to us to handle his estate as his wife had already passed.  On Tuesday of last week, we discovered a folder stuffed with research and the rough draft of a paper which he had written by hand. This wasn't very unusual because he wrote all of his drafts by hand. What was unusual was that the folder was stuffed in the middle of a pile of magazines and there was a letter to us written on the inside of the folder. \n\n  \n*Girls,* *I know you will find this when I'm gone. I want you to know that I love you and that I have always tried to bring you the truth as I found it, as God led me to it. Here is the truth that I know: John wasn't only revealing the future. The things he writes in Revelation have already come to pass, and will happen again. We are living in the New Heaven on the New Earth but we messed it up. We mess it up every time. That's why Genesis says that Adam and Eve were to replenish the Earth. God continues to give us free will and we continue to sin and, girls, He gets more angry every time. We can't know for sure how many cycles of flood and fire have come before and I can only pray that when the nuclear holocaust happens and we are destroyed by fire, God allows humanity another chance to get it right. The signs are clear: the end is nigh. You have always been devout, my loves, and I trust you with this knowledge so that you may tell others. Maybe you can save some of them from the fate that is to come.*   \n\n  \n *Go tell it on the mountain.* \n\n  \nSo, we read the research and we thought this was the best way to let people know, since people here are believers in the unbelievable. We've done this all before, but this time it's worse. We've laughed at His words, killed His prophets, crucified His Son, taken His gifts for granted, and thumbed our noses at Him. The fire will come soon and then the new Adam and the new Eve will get a chance to get it right.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677976079.0,"comments":[{"author":"melodyomania","text":"I've always wondered if this was the way it was. maybe next will be the last.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1677993804.0},{"author":"Cool-Ad7985","text":"Well, it foes say in the bible (Ecclesiastes 1:9)What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678062302.0}]},{"title":"The Twisted Bike","author":"1000andonenites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11i0t45\/the_twisted_bike\/","text":"  \n\nHave you seen those white bicycles set up at street corners, memorials to cyclists killed at that spot?\n\nThere\u2019s one by Main Street, in front of the middle-east food store. Unusually, the white-sprayed bike had been kept all twisted up, as it was when Billy, the cyclist, was killed. Somebody had sprayed splashes of scarlet on it. \n\nThere used to be flowers laid by the twisted bike, and a small framed photo of Billy. Billy was a well-liked, quiet fellow. Early on, there were piles of flowers, teddy bears and cards. Mr. Abbass from the store constantly had to sweep them away. He actually knew the driver who had hit and killed Billy \u2013 one of his regular customers. \n\nYears passed. Rust stained the white and scarlet, and there were no more flowers. The driver had moved away from that area. The framed photo had long gone. The twisted bike was still there though. There was no one to take it away. \n\nMr. Abbass was still there too, his beard now white. He sometime thought about calling the city to get the hulk of twisted rusting metal removed, but somehow never got round to it. \n\nThen, one early morning, as he was sweeping his shop for the day ahead, the menacing buzz of building traffic was shattered by a loud screech, followed by the horrible sound of metal grating on metal.\n\nHe looked up. The still-light morning traffic had ground to halt around two cars locking horns. But the first thing that caught his attention was that the white bike was not there. \n\nAnd then he saw it- a flash of white and scarlet weaving through the angry cars. He must be mistaken - someone was riding it, as twisted up and rusty as it was, coming back through the traffic to the spot where it lay chained for so many years.\n\nThe deformed wheels bobbled onto the sidewalk. Mr. Abbass looked curiously at the cyclist, his face shadowed by the helmet. The drivers of the cars were yelling at each other, cars were honking, and sirens could be heard approaching. \n\nBilly? Why now?\n\nThe rider faded. The white bike lay still, and Mr. Abbass noticed Billy\u2019s photo lying beneath it, Billy smiling brightly. \n\nIt happened again a few days later. It was evening, the afternoon rush hour already dying down. Mr. Abbass was chatting to customers about rising prices when the screech and crunch interrupted them. They ran out. Mr. Abbass saw the white bike immediately, wobbling unsteadily back to its place by the sidewalk. He glanced at his customers- but they were too engaged in the spectacle of the tangled cars and drivers.\n\nThe slanted evening sun struck the cyclist\u2019s face just right this time, and despite the anguish marking it, and the years that had gone by, Mr. Abbass recognized him immediately. \n\nNot Billy. But the driver. Now dead himself, doomed to ride the twisted white bike up and down Main Street for all eternity.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677941036.0,"comments":[{"author":"ShiroiYokai","text":"For a second I thought it was Mumen Rider","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677975721.0},{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Excellent ending!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677979715.0},{"author":"Stranger_at_Night","text":"Reminds me of all the memorials for accidents in my home city.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678046252.0}]},{"title":"Melissa is now only going to train women","author":"shortstory1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11iumwe\/melissa_is_now_only_going_to_train_women\/","text":"Melissa isn't sure whether she wants to train men any more and Melissa is a personal trainer.

It's the only way that she can be among other men and their are ways to get a quickie marriage and divorce online. \n\nAt first it sounded like a great idea, but her first male client called gaigan, he was sweet and kind. Then as soon as they got a quickie marriage so that Melissa could train him, he turned into a real arsehole and his true personality showed. He was being such a jerk to Melissa and not really listening  to her, and he kept making sexist wife jokes. Gaigan was really getting on Melissa's nerves and the hour felt like an eternity. Melissa couldn't believe how quickly guigan had changed as soon as they got a quickie marriage. \n\nAs soon as they got a quickie divorce after the hour session, guigan went back to a sweet individual which was his fake self. Then another male client of Melissa's called Tagan, because he was already married that meant that he had to get a quickie divorce from his wife, and then get a quickie marriage to Melissa. Tegan explained to his real wife that he was only going to be divorced from her for only an hour 3 times a week. His wife finally accepted.

He threatened suicide to Melissa if they got a divorce and Melissa was in a real messy situation now. \n\nThis new male client even threatened to kill his children if they got a divorce. Melissa tried explaining to him that she can only train men, if they were married to her but now that the session has ended, they needed to divorce.

He was a rich man's son from faraway California, I was a poor mountain girl of West Virginia. He kissed me once, twice, then, swept me away, to that fantastical land of Oz or, as they call it, LA. It was, at first, so grand, it was a wonderland I simply could not understand. Love was everywhere we placed our feet, love so radiant and sweet. Roses in the morning, wine at night, it felt like I'd be forever on that flight. But, a sweetheart becomes a husband and husband becomes just a man, a man who always has another plan. He started taking his affection elsewhere and my naive folly was laid bare. I stayed faithful, he stayed playful. Many romances he led, I stayed at home playing dead. At night he enters our bedroom smelling of some woman's perfume, in the morning that grows ever duller I find lipstick stains on his collar. So, lately I've been making him a little morning tonic, of orange juice and arsenic.

Everyone took to my country belle, my family thought she was just swell - my grandma, the real chief of our clan, liked the blonde, white, all American. In the beginning I, too, was in a wedding bliss and thought, 'perhaps this is all there is'. But it was still the midday of my life then and boys gotta have their fun before they're men. So I kept a mistress here, a girlfriend there, a dalliance or a tryst if I'd time to spare. Soon chill set in as days went by between my little West Virginian and I. Now, with great contempt she looks at me and I her with something of apathy. It's an intolerable situation needing some drastic remediation. But I can't divorce her - alas, there's an (expensive) rub - we got married without a prenup. So, I've been adding a little mercury in the wine she drinks to drown misery.

An HDMI cable ran up through the floor, but he couldn\u2019t find its other end anywhere. \u2018Odd,\u2019 he thought, as it seemed the line ran down into the crawlspace and terminated somewhere under the house. \u2018Why would anyone do that?\u2019 He wondered. \n\nAs he was installing the TV, he decided to try an experiment. \u2018What could it hurt?\u2019 He shrugged.\n\nHe plugged the HDMI cable into Input 1, turned the TV on, and instantly regretted his decision. \n\nWhat appeared on the screen seemed like grainy CC TV footage showing a man shackled to a wall by his hands and ankles in a dark, cramped space. The floor was pea gravel and there was almost no light, the ceiling above too shallow for him to stand. His hair was long and matted, beard grown down to the floor, and he was so emaciated that Terry scarcely believed he could be alive. When he looked up, Terry saw the sadness in his eyes as the man wept. \u201cPlease help.\u201d He whispered.\n\nTerry shut the screen off as he leapt back in shock. \u2018What the hell was that? Is that under my house?\u2019 He panicked.\n\nRunning outside, he located the crawlspace hatch and opened it as quickly as he could. He took out his cellphone, shined the flashlight inside, and saw\u2026nothing. While the space was immediately recognizable from the footage, there was no man down there\u2026no shackles on the wall. But, what he did see, was the other end of the HDMI cable laying in the gravel. \n\n\u2018How is that possible?\u2019 His mind was racing. Walking back into the house, he mustered up the courage to flick the TV on again and saw\u2026a different man. Younger, not quite as emaciated, but still shackled to the wall. Again, the man met Terry\u2019s eyes and he too whispered, \u201cPlease help.\u201d \n\nTerry had no idea what to do. He wanted to help these men, but they were trapped somewhere he couldn\u2019t access.

Leaving the crawlspace hatch open, Terry crawled on hands and knees to the cable lying in the gravel. When he went to plug it in, he realized there was no power to connect to, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. As soon as the cable was inserted into the monitor, grainy footage flashed on the screen. \n\nTo his horror, Terry saw neither of the two men from earlier, but himself.

I see their videos on tiktok and they are not great cooks at all. Their food have no soul and my food are so much better than theirs. I know how to make something taste amazing and I am a master at it. Uncle Roger and Gordon Ramsay are ametures compared to me and I am going to tell you how I make food amazing. It's going to blow your minds away and uncle Roger and gordan Ramsay are going to be worshipping my feet. I am going to tell you what i do to make food amazing. \n\nFor example take the graceful chicken curry and I do all of the usual stuff that makes chicken curry amazing. Then it's missing something, so I bring the psychotic Martin and I tell him to scream at my chicken curry, I tell him to scream at the top of his lungs. So he gives off a brilliant scream at the too his lungs at my chicken curry, and the chicken curry is so scared. That fear gives the chicken the ultimate flavour and you can just smell it. You know when something smells good, just to let you know that it's going to be fantastic. \n\nThat's just chicken and soups are out of this world. Take the tarka Dahl curry soup and it's one of my favourites, I do all the usual stuffs to make up the tarka Dahl and I'm sure uncle Roger and Gordon Ramsay would just stop there. Not me though I take it a step further to make it taste so delicious and just make it feel amazing. You see I abducted a guy off the road and I put him in my attic, and I tied him up. I have been beating him up and making him scared for the last 3 days. \n\nI take my tarka doll up to the attic as the abducted mans fear and dread will give the tarka dall the very best seasoning. I sit in the attic with this man in my attic, and let the tarka fall simmer in this man's stressful state. I can just smell it and uncle Roger and Gordon Ramsay don't give their food this sort of care. The abducted man is definitely hungry but it's not for him, but rather for me to eat. Cooking is hard and it takes a lot of dedication to make the finest things. \n\nNow my fear of being caught after killing the man in my attic, will give the best taste to my lasagne.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1677920587.0,"comments":[{"author":"Agentbond2007","text":"Funny story, well written, creative username","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677928815.0},{"author":"Lunnaris","text":"I intend this criticism in good faith and to be constructive, but I thought I'd comment since I've read plenty of your stories.\n\n\nEnglish is my second language so I know mistakes can happen more often than not, but you should double check for grammar mistakes and autocorrect mishaps before posting. And of course edit as necessary once posted. \n\n\nI quite like the concept you're going for but as a story this lacks a coherent structure, and there's questions it raises that take away from the horror and immersion. \n\nWe have Narrator, Martin and Kidnapped Guy. \nIt's fine knowing nothing of N, except that they are great at cooking. \nWe have those two famous cook brought up time and time again in the same way each time. I guess you're going for a sense of lyrical repetition but aside from the first time it doesn't give the reader any new info (and hardly does the first time but that's my subjective preferences I guess) and it goes on for way too long so it ends up feeling like fluff added just to hit a number of words. It also makes the lack of plot much more noticeable. \nSuddenly we get M, about who we only know that he's psychotic (this becomes an issue later) and that he screams to food on command.\nWe then are introduced to KG and not using a name for him makes it a different person from M. \nThe story reaches its peak with a heavy handed explanation of its core concept as the \"big reveal\", which I don't think works here. \nWe know that N abducted the KG and kept in his house for at least three days so he's properly scared to vibe cook N's meals. \nThe end. \nOkay as I said cool concept, but there's no story here, maybe a first draft of one. There's one whole character introduced (if calling him psychotic counts but I could let that slide) and planting the seeds for the reveal. But he only exists for a scene without even the faintest of reasons to be there and do that.\nSince he's transferring his fear by yelling (which we learn later) at the food we don't even know his emotional state. Being psychotic is not an emotion, if that's what you meant. \nAs I said the concept has potential but I'd be hard pressed to find arguments to defend this post being \"a story\". \nIt also feels like a low effort post, which is something that your past stories have had in common, along with good faith replies pointing this out by other readers and I don't think you're taking into account any of it and of course never work on those issues. Or at least that's what I've felt reading your posts here, a rejection to fix this reoccurring issues in your works. \nHope my words can reach you and good luck.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677951217.0},{"author":"KaralDaskin","text":"I liked the repetition of the other chefs.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677965262.0},{"author":"KaralDaskin","text":"I liked the repetition of the other chefs.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677965403.0},{"author":"blo0dy_roses","text":"Time to show this to Uncle Rodger.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678035314.0}]},{"title":"Close to the Skin","author":"firesidechats451","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11hlpqd\/close_to_the_skin\/","text":"I\u2019ve always wanted a tattoo, but I never found something I liked enough to put on my body, you know?

How the currents of electricity and the currents of blood provided a comparable function in both organic and artificial matter. He always saw me as so much more than the latter. \n\nThe first part he completed was my head, or rather my brain. There was a snap, a loud ringing, feedback, and then light in my sensors, and I saw myself suspended, without form, in his workshop. And I saw him. \n\nHe told me he activated me like this so I could watch my own creation, and be conscious of my physicality as it came into being. I watched gears connect, plates tessellate, wires like veins running up my endoskeleton. \n\nMy body was perfect, until it wasn\u2019t.

I just know to the core of my being that I am supposed to be human. That I *was* a human.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy body was plastic, and as such it was easy for me to stay stoic around Tay and her parents. But mentally I was always awake, and I was going crazy.\n\nThey got me on a weekend and all left on Monday. Right away, my mission was clear: Find out more about where the parents had gotten me. Some kind of occult shop, maybe?\n\nI toddled into their room.\n\nIn the closet, there was a Target bag with a pillow and some vitamins still in it. I found the receipt and read it. It included a Safiyah Doll and said I had been $24.99. But I was alive, I could read, I knew what Target, receipts, and prices were. I tried to remember ever going to school and learning things. To remember anything.\n\nI spent the rest of the day exploring as much of the house as I could. I couldn't descend the stairs, but I flung myself down without it hurting, then walked around. There was an organized minimalism to everything, not much to see. I couldn't get back up the stairs, so I just lay nearby. When they came home, the mom picked me up and put me in Tay's room, unfazed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weeks and months went by. I never got less confused, or indignant.

He got her this headlining gig, and filled her head with a lot of nonsense about having to have the most unforgettable stage show ever. He told her to think Altamont. Think Station Nightclub. Think Woodstock \u201999.\u00a0\n\nThere were four opening acts and we had eight minutes to set the stage. I was ready with an oil barrel filled with a mix of Fentanyl, soap, and water on a dolly ready to roll. I wore a tyvek suit for safety.\n\nWhen the third band finished, the crowd was pumped. I rolled the barrel out, and froze at the size of the crowd. Hundreds of people.\n\nAfter the barrel was out and I set the blower on top, I scrambled for the band\u2019s gear. The singer looked a little nervous, but her new manager assured her that she would be talked about for lifetimes.\n\nI assured the manager everything was set. He wondered if there was anything special I wanted. I asked if I could get a case of High Life. He chuckled and told me good luck with the show.\u00a0That\u2019s how fast you could damn your immortal soul. \n\nThe show started, and the singer tore through song after song. The crowd loved every minute.\n\nAs she was hitting her big high note, she looked at me for the cue.\n\nI pressed the button, and out of the barrel blew out thousands of bubbles. Big ones, small ones all floated like snowflakes out into the crowd. It was magic. Her fans were in awe. \n\nThen the screaming started.\u00a0\n\nYou ever see War of the Worlds, where the aliens shoot the ray gone and people vanish? Imagine that, but with bubbles. As soon as a bubble burst on someone, they collapsed and stopped breathing. Some people had multiple bubbles popped on them and sent them into violent seizures. People foamed at the mouth, turned blue and passed out. By the time people realized what was happening, it was too late. It\u2019s tough for that many people to coordinate an exit. \n\nThe manager had such a big smile on his face. It was terrifying. \n\nThe singer stopped and watched the crowd fall like dominoes. You know that scene where Thanos snaps his fingers and everyone popped? It was a lot like that, only with bubbles.\u00a0\n\nThen the air conditioning turned on.\u00a0\n\nThat killer swarm of bubbles blew back at the stage. No one was safe. Everyone on staged fell, one pop at a time. The singer stood there like an angel. It was like the bubbles were purposely flying around her. She was glowing. It was her big moment.\u00a0\n\nThen the bubbles burst around her, and so did she.\n\nAt the end, it was only me in my sweaty plastic suit, with my thumb on the trigger. The new manager handed me a case of High Life. He smiled and walked away.\u00a0\n\nThe beer wasn\u2019t even cold.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677878053.0,"comments":[{"author":"DannyBones00","text":"Damn.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677914280.0}]},{"title":"Cannibal Parents","author":"aicont","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11hi3nx\/cannibal_parents\/","text":"Lena had been hearing strange whispers in her home for months.

Maybe it\u2019s the way he stares at me, thinking I don\u2019t notice him, or maybe the weird excuses to constantly touch me. Either way, the job is still really good money for me. I\u2019ve been so tired all day today and since it was Halloween, I\u2019d probably just keep my lights off and pretend I\u2019m not home to keep trick or treaters from bothering me. Before I left work, I saw a box waiting for me by my computer. Picking it up, I noticed it was from my boss. I thought it was a little weird since it seemed like I was the only one who got anything. I took it anyway and went to my car to drive home. I got home right before kids went outside to start trick or treating and when I got home, I noticed a few things such as doors I don\u2019t remember leaving open and a few things moved around and in different spots than what I left them. I chalked it up to bad memory and moved on. I set the box down and opened it, then looked inside. It was all my favorite candy. \u201cHow does he know I like all this?\u201d I asked.Within the box, there was a note. Written on the note it said \u2018Save some for me :)\u2019. I was a little weirded out reading that. \u201cSave some for me? What does he mean by that?\u201d I asked out loud to myself. Just then, I heard something. The closet door across the hall slowly started to open. Suddenly, my boss came out of my closet, holding a knife. He ran towards me, trying to kill me. I ran out of the kitchen and to my bathroom, where I hid and called the police. The woman on the phone said they\u2019d only be about 5 minutes and told me to stay on the phone with her. While I was waiting, I could hear him pounding on the door, trying to get inside. As soon as I heard the police sirens, though, the pounding stopped and everything was silent. When the police checked my house, they could not find anything or anyone inside. Since then, I\u2019ve moved to another house and found another job.

You and your friend would be two of very few people to venture it. You both start to pack up your backpacks with basic supplies, such as food, water, your cameras, etc. You and your friend hop in your car and you start to make your way to the mall.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, you pull up in the parking lot of the mall. You and your friend get out of the car and start recording. The mall looks really run down, there's graffiti everywhere and some of the windows are smashed. You and your friend figure that other people must've decided to explore the mall too, so they smashed a few windows to get in. You two enter through one of the smashed windows and start drifting the cameras to show what part of the mall you're in. You appear to be in the main lobby of the mall, with tables, chairs, a directory, etc. You guys look at the directory and the mall looks huge, there are many stores and restaurants. You both just decide to wander around the mall and see what you pass, and if you two pass by someplace interesting, you'll go in and explore it.\n\nYou and your friend already explored a few stores and restaurants and are now just walking around the mall when you thought you heard rustling coming from behind you. You look back and you don't see anything that seems out of place. Eventually, you and your friend feel like you got enough footage for a creepy YouTube video, so you guys stop recording and start making your way towards the exit to go home.\n\nSuddenly, you hear the rustling again. When you look back this time, you see a figure hiding behind a sign. You call out, but the figure doesn't say anything in response. It stands up, where you can see that it is very clearly a grown man, about 6'11 ft. tall. He starts to sprint towards you and your friend. It takes a little bit, but you notice that the man seems to be holding a large machete. You and your friend scream and run to your car. You manage to get in and start the car, you try to drive, but you just scrape really hard on the concrete. You both get out to see what happened, and the tires are all slashed! The man must've slashed them while you and your friend were exploring the mall. So you both get out of the car and start running to your house as fast as you can.

Suddenly, through the small round porthole on the hatch, a blinding light shines through, followed by a bang and an earthquake. I screamed as my mom held me. This was followed by several other flashes of lights, followed by quakes, with some not as intense. The  TV in mediately shut off after the first flash.\n\n After several days, we left the bunker, and tracked across a barren wasteland.

I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because I was starving, but it was the best tasting apples I ever taken a bit out of. It was sweet and juicy. \n\n I asked him who he was. His response was strange.

The uses and benefits of the application extended outside of these parameters, showing positive impacts in all areas where implemented. The results were staggering. Overall quality of life is now the best it has ever been in recorded history. There is no war. The planet is at peace. \n\nMarie\u2019s eyes snapped open.

She stood up and took off in a random direction, hoping to see something. There had to be an answer, something she could use\u2026anything. Everything started to get dark. \u201cOh no\u2026not again\u2026not again!\u201d She screamed and tried to keep going. Maybe she could get farther this time.

You could lie amongst them and time would fly away from you.\n\nEarth was, at the time, a sapphire gleaming in the mines of space.

Like a cat eying the mouse.\n\nThey poured in in droves, and caught everyone by surprise. Our flimsy weapons were no match for their advanced masterpieces. They wielded sticks that shot and drove humming cars with pointy snouts.\n\nThey packed all they could find\u2014man, woman and child\u2014and shipped us back to their home. And I witnessed Earth\u2014*truly*\u2014for the first time.

Because how can they prove you drowned them and that it wasn\u2019t just an accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Jessy?\u201d\n\nJessy took a shot and pounded the rest of his beer. He was drinking too quickly. His girlfriend of five years had broken up with him, and there were unsubstantiated rumors that she was cheating on him with Chad. \n\n\u201cFirst I\u2019d steal his wallet. Then, on his personal computer, I\u2019d search \u2018does bleach get rid of blood,\u2019 and, \u2018does fire get rid of evidence.\u2019 After that I\u2019d find the oldest lady in walking distance that lives alone. On a night where he\u2019d have no alibi, like when he was alone studying for finals, I\u2019d break into that old lady\u2019s house. I\u2019d make sure it was quiet, but also an obvious break in. It\u2019d be late so she\u2019d be asleep. What you do is strangle the old lady with any electric cord in the house so they can\u2019t trace it to you. Once she\u2019s dead, you go to the kitchen, get a knife, and stab her a bunch. Make it gruesome. Just as you're about to leave, you place the stolen wallet somewhere out of sight near the dead lady. Under the bed is good. Then you leave. A neighbor will probably notice the break in the next day, and the police are gonna go in and find the body. Homicide clearance rates are not great these days. In some places it\u2019s barely fifty percent. Flip of a coin. So cops really want to solve murders. They\u2019re going to tear that place apart and soon they\u2019ll find the wallet. Their smoking gun. They\u2019re gonna have that guy in the station in twenty minutes to interrogate him. Here\u2019s the best part. He\u2019s not gonna know why they're questioning him, and when they reveal they think he murdered someone he\u2019s going to get nervous. Real nervous. Which to the police will make him seem guilty. They\u2019ll get a warrant, search his laptop and find those incriminating searches. He\u2019ll be charged. No jury will believe him. And because of how brutal the murder was he\u2019ll get the death penalty. And the state will kill him. That\u2019s how I\u2019d kill someone.\u201d\n\nThe door opened, and Chad entered the room empty handed.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the booze?\u201d Elijah asked.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get any.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey ID\u2019d me, and I can\u2019t find my wallet.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677689547.0,"comments":[{"author":"mysvalt","text":"Great story my guy","upvotes":132,"created_utc":1677689787.0},{"author":"HotelEntropy","text":"Oh this is clever!","upvotes":47,"created_utc":1677690463.0},{"author":"lanixvar","text":"only problem is he now needs to set the house on fire and make it look like he was the only one to crawl out alive.","upvotes":34,"created_utc":1677703803.0},{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Revealed his set-up a bit too soon.

Several others joined in, calling out their eagerness to begin.\n\nThere were about a hundred teenagers gathered in the old warehouse on the outskirts of town.

The rest were there to watch and record the insane event.\n\nDue to the nature of the challenge, all of the contestants were athletic boys.\n\n\u201cThe Lobotomy Challenge is a test of endurance,\u201d the masked teenager announced, \u201cWhoever lasts the longest, wins the prize.\u201d He gestured at the bag of cash sitting near his feet.\n\nOn the floor in the center of the warehouse were thirty specially designed hollow wooden boxes.

Many of them bragged about how they were going to be the ones to win.\n\n\u201cBegin,\u201d he announced.\n\nEach contestant assumed a push-up position over their box with their eyes centered over the rows of nails. That was the required position to take part in the challenge. They were expected to hold that position as long as possible or forfeit. The winner was the one who stayed in position the longest.\n\nThe masked teenager waited five minutes, making sure everyone was in position before he pulled out a small handheld remote.\n\n*I told you I\u2019d get my revenge one day*.

It was a special type of oil, designed to flow quickly.\n\nBy the time the contestants realized what was happening, it was too late. The oil flowed under their hands making it impossible for them to hold themselves up.\n\nThe crowd screamed and ran as the contestants began to slip and fall, impaling their faces on the nails sticking out of the boxes.\n\nThe masked teenager lifted the voice changer to his mouth and said, \u201cI win,\u201d before picking up the bag of cash and hopping off the stack of pallets to leave.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677703979.0,"comments":[{"author":"jessiehalcyon","text":"Revenge is sweet and apparently slippery.

It's enough to know that by the time he was naked in the shed it was too late for him to change his mind.\n\nHe broke down easily. He wasn't particularly thick skinned.\n\nThat's where the hook came in\u2014\n\npushed through a fold of flesh on his back.\n\nHe wasn't much in the size department, but I didn't intend for him to get hung up on it. Unfortunately, he kept trying to escape, so what choice did I have? Then he seemed quite insecure, so I pierced him with another steel hook just in case.\n\nLike I said:\n\n*Bloody good hook.*\n\nAfter he stopped struggling, I took him down and dragged him to my boat. Then we went fishing.\n\nHold on, though.\n\nI may need to backtrack a little, because you may be wondering how I even knew she was out there.\n\nThe answer is: I'd already seen her swimming a few times.\n\nIt was love at first sight.\n\nLike many couples nowadays we met on the net.\n\nSo back to when I was fishing:\n\nI was in my boat with the Craigslist man with the steel hooks in his back. I had tied a thick rope to one of the hooks, placed the man onto a net, and pushed them both overboard. He splashed and choked, attracting a lot of attention.\n\nI waited for her call.\n\nIt came.\n\nShe sounded so near to me.\n\nWhen she swam just close enough to the Craigslist man in the water, I pulled in the net\u2014and there she was: shining, mine to the gills and writhing so enticingly!\n\nI took her ashore.\n\nI placed her in a water tank and told her she would be my wife.\n\nI screwed her\u2014\n\nshut.\n\nFor days I watched her bang\u2014\n\non the glass.\n\nUntil one day it happened: the glass cracked, the tank broke open, and with the water she spilled onto the floor.\n\nNow here I am, watching my marriage fall apart.\n\nHer gills are barely stirring.\n\nHer face: dry and still.\n\nIt's only her scaly tail that's still gently moving.\n\nI caught my wife with another man. I met her on the net. I thought our love would last forever, but now, listening to her shriek, I realize I was catfished!

They had heard rumors of a hidden room, filled with treasure and ancient artifacts, and they were convinced that they were the ones who would find it.\n\nOne dark and stormy night, they crept up to the house and tried the door. To their surprise, it was unlocked. They entered cautiously, their flashlights casting eerie shadows on the walls.\n\nAs they made their way through the dusty, cobweb-filled rooms, they heard strange noises coming from upstairs. They hesitated, but Jake urged them on, convinced that they were getting closer to the hidden room.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, they found a door that was slightly ajar. Jake pushed it open and stepped inside, followed closely by the others. But what they found inside was not what they had been expecting.\n\nThe room was empty, except for a single wooden chair in the center. On the chair sat an old man, with long, grey hair and a face that was twisted in a permanent scowl. He stared at them with cold, dead eyes, and the teens froze in fear.\n\nSuddenly, the man spoke. His voice was low and raspy, and it sent shivers down their spines. \"You shouldn't have come here,\" he said. \"This is my house, and I don't like visitors.\"\n\nThe teens tried to back away, but they found that they were rooted to the spot. The man rose from the chair and began to shuffle towards them, his eyes fixed on Jake.\n\n\"You're the leader, aren't you?\" he said. \"You think you're so brave, but you have no idea what you've unleashed.\"\n\nJake tried to run, but the man was too fast. He grabbed Jake by the arm and pulled him close, his breath hot on his face. \"You will regret this,\" he whispered. \"You will all regret this.\"\n\nThe other teens managed to break free and run down the stairs, but Jake was never seen again. Some say that he was trapped in the hidden room, forever at the mercy of the vengeful spirit that haunted the old house. Others say that he was taken to another world, where he suffered for his trespasses.\n\nWhatever the truth may be, the old house on the outskirts of town still stands, a silent testament to the dangers that lurk in the darkness. And the local kids still tell stories about the things that happened there, warning each other to stay far away from its cursed walls.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677724833.0,"comments":[{"author":"ThatPopGeek","text":"This is day one of my month long writing challenge please let me know what you think and what can be improved","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677725695.0},{"author":"Desperate-Device5589","text":"But but Jake just wanted to be your friend can't we all just be FRIENDS........I promise it won't hurt............it won't hurt.......MUCH........","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677733273.0},{"author":"kshwixt","text":"This is a fantastic campfire story.

I\u2019d hear him talk to himself, sometimes in laughter and play, sometimes in whispers he thought I couldn\u2019t hear. He\u2019d go out to the woods behind our house alone and play there endlessly.\n\nWhen I asked him what he does out in the woods, he said the old mother would sometimes take him to the place where she\u2019s from. When I asked him where that is, he wouldn\u2019t tell. After that, every time I asked, he\u2019d put his tiny hands over his mouth and shake his head vigorously.\n\nSomehow, his dad had gotten Matt to talk about it when he was at his place for a weekend. When he dropped him off, he told me what Matt had said.\n\n\u201c*Old mother lives in the rock, deep below.*\u201d\n\nMatt became more distant.

In front of it stood Matt, holding the hand of a floating old woman. She wore a thick, dark dress with torn lacing, her skin a pale gray. Her eyes and lips were black, frozen to death.\n\nMatt noticed me, turned around smiling and said \u201cOld mother wants me to come with her. She says that if I go, I can float too!\u201d\n\nThe hill opened into a dark pit, and they descended down into the earth, the rock moulding and trapping them inside.

The odd thing is that the house is seemingly able to move at the will of the owner. Hopefully this narrows things down enough for you to locate me.\n\nI should introduce myself. I am an autumnal pixie of the Seelie Court by the name of Leafblossom. I am an intrepid explorer and cartographer by trade. I entered this realm through the ancient art of tree-hopping: using the magical properties of various trees to transport between dimensions. However, when I got to this realm, I found my magical powers waning rapidly. It's my hypothesis that large amounts of cold-forged iron, or some other magic-sapping metal, have permeated the air around your hives, or perhaps just this hive in particular. I was unable to locate a return tree before I was captured. He was riding this iron four-legged spider-horse, and drinking mead out of an immaculate glass bottle wrapped in brown paper. He was upon me before I could react, and I haven't been able to escape his clutches since.\n\nMy captor appears to be some form of local magistrate or lord. The less said about him and his cohorts the better. Their corrousing is... obscene and shameful. If someone could rescue me from him, and bring me to the nearest \"american chestnut\" tree, I would be eternally indebted to you.\n\nI must make haste. He returns soon. Please, I beg of you, find pity in your heart. I... I need this to stop. He hasn't let me out of this cage in a season or longer. I don't know when he'll leave this tablet in arm's reach next. I will grant any boon or do any service in my power for anyone who helps me, I swear on my true name. Please, just have pity.\n\nI must go. Thank you to anyone who reads this. There's a possibility I may gain access again in the future, so reply letters would be appreciated, if for no other reason than to keep my spirits up. If anyone could help explain the strange ways of you humans, I would appreciate it greatly.

They're pearly, have a pore on top, and completely cover the skin under the fur.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to take pictures, but that ass Nash walked out and kicked at Gremlin, making it run away. I yelled at him, but he just laughed and said garages aren't for Disney princesses, unless I wanted to play with his snake. I slapped him before running to my dad, who finally fired Nash.\n\nBut I didn't see Gremlin after that. I hope Nash didn't scare it away for good because I'm worried about those bumps. I'm going to stay late in case Gremlin returns, so I can take pictures.\n\n.\n\n**Edit:** Guys, I'm scared. I'm in my car, I was waiting for Gremlin and saw Nash's truck park a distance away. He walked over, and I froze when I saw him put on his hood, mask, and gloves.\n\nIt was too dark for him to notice me and I watched him break into the garage. I called the police, they said they'd be here soon and told me to drive somewhere safe. I was ready to do that, until I saw Gremlin run inside the garage.\n\nIf Nash sees Gremlin, he'll hurt it. Maybe kill it. I don't know what to do.\n\n.\u00a0\n\n**Edit:** I'm in an ambulance, they're telling me to put the phone down, but I need answers.\n\nI was stupid, I honked the horn to distract Nash. He barged out with his crowbar and I yelled that I called the cops, but he didn't hear me and shattered my windshield. I screamed and dropped my phone as I shielded my face. I squeezed into the backseat, ready to run, but the silhouette charging towards us from the garage made me freeze.\n\nIt was the size of a horse, but moved like a spider with a billion vine-like legs.\n\nNash noticed it too late as one of its legs knocked him flat on the ground, and I watched, trembling, as the legs cocooned him completely. Did it do the same to Gremlin?\n\nThe creature reached for me and I cowered, but the blaring sirens thankfully scared it off into the shadows.\u00a0\n\nI tried to tell the police what happened and insisted we check the cameras, but all we saw was Nash's destruction before a mysterious black streak cracked the lenses, interrupting the feed.\n\nI didn't know what to say. Neither did anyone else. But everyone agreed I should go to the hospital. Walking to an ambulance, I noticed Gremlin on the garage roof, but my relief became shock when it swished its tail.\u00a0\n\nOr \u2026 tails.\n\nMany vine-like tails.\n\nI blinked, and it was just a regular tail.\u00a0\n\nMaybe I imagined it.

I finally started writing it a few years ago.\n\nThere had never been anything I had written that was so personal. So me.\n\nIt just so happened that I began sending out query letters at the start of the pandemic. It was perfect. Everyone had time on their hands. Time to read the tale of my soul.\n\nI went to the post office and mailed my submissions the old fashioned way, and I sent them to 63 agents. It was finally my time. My essence was in those manuscripts.\n\nIt took six months for me to get the first response, and then every single one of them came back. They had all taken the time to send me letters through the post office. To my surprise, all of them were rejection letters, and every single one of them had a personal note. \n\nAll but one had the most vile things to say about my work. The stand out was from an agent in New York. Nothing was written, but a small bit of fecal matter had been smeared on the page as a response.\n\nI realized that a new approach was needed.\n\nIt\u2019s now been 14 severed break lines, 43 bullets, an untold number of White Mochas from Starbucks, and 6 beheadings later. I\u2019m willing to put in the effort.\n\nI\u2019m sending out more submissions to a new crop of agents. I hope they\u2019re more receptive. If not, I\u2019ll just start all over. \n\nIt\u2019s all about the law of averages.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677622710.0,"comments":[{"author":"tasosaki","text":"What a shitty way to reject someone. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)\n\nEdit: really enjoyed this one","upvotes":35,"created_utc":1677625449.0},{"author":"TryHardKenichi","text":"Eventually, word of your hard work and dedication will spread and the agents will be jumping over each other to publish your work.\n\nGanbatte!","upvotes":14,"created_utc":1677628425.0},{"author":"vilidj_idjit","text":"I don't get it","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1677638270.0},{"author":"Resident-Evil31415","text":"6 beheadings \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677702918.0}]},{"title":"Captivation Street","author":"k_g_lewis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11egwfl\/captivation_street\/","text":"\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Caleb asked.\n\nHis wife, Violet, was sitting backward with her knees on the couch, peeking out through the gap in the curtains.\n\n\u201cWaiting,\u201d Violet replied.\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Caleb walked over so he could see through the gap.\n\n\u201cFor that,\u201d Violet pointed at the car that was driving slowly down the street.\n\nCaleb watched the black SUV cruise by the house.

People started falling sick with something and turned into these...creatures, if you can even call them that. I've been held up in this house located in a neighborhood somewhat farther out from the city. Supply gathering has been relatively easy. People that fell ill became these mindless aggressive freaks of nature. Each with their own unique mutation. Some have fallen to using all fours since the bones in their limbs have dislocated and now resemble those of a canine. I call those kind \"hounds\". Others have began to mix their stomach acid and spit to shoot oral projectiles at targets. You get the point. \n\nTheir senses aren't the best and have the cognitive process of a toddler. Smart enough to track you down and go after  you but not enough of an attention span to go after you for more than a minute at most. Stamina and coordination have also been slowed down. Anyway, I have had to go farther and farther when it comes to supply gathering. I've been running stores dry, medicine and food are the top concerns, but there's something even farther to find. Gas. Solar panels don't do shit and I'm not smart enough to make these cheap ass electric generators work. \n\nMy electricity usage is rationed to 2 hours a day max. Power to gas stations has long since been cut off so I'm funneling it out of cars or anything else that can provide it. I have various lights outside that keep these freaks at bay. They don't like bright lights for some reason. I've also put together a kind of electric fence that goes up during the day. The lights will then go on at night. Today I have run out of gas. Both for my car and the generator. Winter has come and so has a storm. The sun is setting at the moment and I am DONE fucked. Unless I can shovel 3+ and coming feet of snow for miles on end, this is my last night alive. Walking anywhere is nearly impossible due to it being -25 degrees and dropping by the minute. I'm seeing these things slowly coming to the house. I have a flashlight with me, but that will only keep any that come towards the door at bay for a few minutes at most. It's been a hell being alone and barely surviving these past few months. At least I can say I survived as long as I could.

The group consisted of experienced cavers who had traversed many underground passages before, but this cave was different. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, breathing down their necks and taunting them with whispers of long-forgotten secrets.\n\nAs they journeyed deeper into the cave, they began to notice strange markings on the walls. Symbols that no one in the group could recognize, carved into the stone with a precision that seemed almost otherworldly. The air grew thick and oppressive, and they felt as if they were being watched by unseen eyes.\n\nDespite their unease, the group pressed on, drawn deeper into the cave by a force they could not explain. They eventually came to a massive chamber that seemed to stretch on forever. In the center of the room was a pool of still water, and the walls were lined with strange, glowing crystals.\n\nAs they approached the pool, they felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over them. It was as if the water itself was alive and pulsing with malevolent energy. They tried to turn back, but it was too late. The entrance to the cave had disappeared, and they were trapped in the darkness.\n\nAs the days passed, the group began to turn on each other. The oppressive atmosphere of the cave had taken its toll, and they could no longer trust one another. The whispers of the cave grew louder, and they started to see strange, shadowy figures moving in the darkness.\n\nOne by one, the members of the group began to disappear. Some were swallowed up by the shadows, while others seemed to simply vanish into thin air. The survivors were left alone in the darkness, haunted by the memory of what they had seen and the knowledge that they would never leave the cave alive.\n\nYears later, a team of cavers discovered the remains of the group in the depths of the Linville Caverns. Their bodies were twisted and contorted, their faces frozen in terror. No one could explain what had happened to them, but those who ventured into the cave could still hear their screams echoing through the darkness. There have been more disappearances in the area that have never been solved.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677649096.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"He's So Good","author":"1000andonenites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11e5eap\/hes_so_good\/","text":"  I look desperately at Amy, my therapist, my head heavy from sleeplessness and dread.\n\n\u201cLila was there all night\u201d I mumble. \u201cShe won\u2019t let me sleep\u201d.\n\nAmy nods understandingly and then says, seemingly randomly, \u201cYou\u2019re visiting Anthony later today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI gulp.

Either way she was certain they both would be so incredibly happy, the tiny one would be the solutions to all their issues. \n\nAnd then, pain flooded her body like a wave crashing into it. \n\nShe whimpered, but chose to ignore the signs of labour that slowly took a hold of her. \n\nShe had to wait for her husband to get home. \n\nRestlessly she wandered a few steps in one direction, and then back. Over and over again. \n\nEven hours later, when the pains were enough to render her screaming, she waited for him. \n\nWithout him she couldn\u2019t go the hospital. She needed him so badly to be with her, not even thinking of anything else. \n\nEven when the blood started gushing, colouring the carpet a terrifying red colour, she waited for her husband. \n\nAfter, when she feared she might lose consciousness, she still simply waited for his return. She wished for him to come take care of them. \n\nAnd then, a child was born, wailing loudly and strongly. \n\nWeakened, as she sat against the wall of the nursery in a pool of her own blood, she held the newborn against her chest and simply continued on\u2026 waiting. \n\nIt would be another while before she finally heard him unlock the front door. \n\nThen she heard him unlock and unbolt the next one. \n\nLastly, he unlocked the chain around one of her ankles. \n\nHer husband was finally home, to meet their daughter.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677540153.0,"comments":[{"author":"7298Topkatt","text":"Nice job building up the suspense.

In fact, I kind of despise it. To me, true beauty is in the natural world. Give me a scenic landscape any day over portraits of people uncomfortable in their own skin. \n\nUnfortunately, nature photography still doesn\u2019t pay the bills. I\u2019m stuck snapping shots at bland weddings. The men in their ill-fitting, rented tuxes and bridesmaids with too much make up always make me uneasy. Each event is always replete with bad dancing and awkward speeches. \n\nI wondered though, sometimes it might be nice to let loose and not care. Maybe that\u2019s why I went out to Ranger\u2019s Peak at Golden Hour, just before sunset with Jasmine. She told me that I had to get out of my comfort zone. I still wasn\u2019t sure how I was supposed to do that.\n\nIt was her suggestion that we go to Ranger\u2019s Peak. A simple conversation in photography class leading to the idea. Her na\u00efve belief in a local monster didn\u2019t detract from my opinion of her. \n\n\u201cBig Foot exists, Peter\u201d, she enthusiastically proclaimed. I didn\u2019t care though, even if we didn\u2019t catch a picture of the elusive creature, I\u2019d still get a great shot of a lake surrounded by trees and mountains that was only accessible from a two-hour mountainous hike. \n\nGetting there in time for the photo was easier than I thought. Jasmine was in surprisingly good spirits even knowing that it would be dark soon. I set up my camera at the top of the peak and waited for the tell-tale signs of a 2023 nature photography award opportunity.\n\nI wasn\u2019t disappointed that Big Foot didn\u2019t show that night.  Jasmine\u2019s enthusiasm was infectious, at least at first. What I first I took as a shared passion steadily devolved though into mild annoyance.\n\n\u201cWhy did you get in to photography? Why are you always so quiet? I bet you would enjoy coming to hang out at the campus caf\u00e9 with me taking photos of unsuspecting people\u201d\n\nOn and on, it never ended. I eventually stopped talking with her altogether. I tried taking some shots of the lake below, but they were all just so uninspiring like every shot I\u2019ve seen posted online. \n\n\u201cWhy are you such an asshole, Peter\u201d, Jasmine said surprising me. I had no idea why she just changed. Her mood swinging from excited to quiet to angry. \n\nI just don\u2019t know why she started to yell. When she shoved me, it almost caused me to knock my camera 300 feet below to the pristine water. \n\nFinally, I had enough and pushed back.\n\n\\--\n\n\u201cThis piece is amazing, young man. I must have seen dozens of shots from the top of Ranger\u2019s Peak but I\u2019ve never quite seen one like this.

You see derricks parents were very abusive to one and another and derrick witnessed their verbal tirades against each other, and he witnessed both of them being physically abusive to each other. Derrick thought that this was normal of a marriage couple. It has been ingrained into his mind and derricks view of relationship is very demented. Derrick still has dreams of one day making a family and even if it is exactly like his own parents. Derrick is a lost lamb in a vicious world. \n\nDerrick once asked out a woman that he fancied and when he asked her out, the woman didn't let him down gently. She really started calling him ugly and laughing at him. This reminded him of his own parents marriage and as this woman was laying into derrick, he thought he was married to her. Derrick said to her \"are we married because this is what married couples do?\" And the woman wasn't laughing any more. She seemed and irritated and confused and she replied with \"you nutter were not married\" but derrick wasn't having it. \n\n\"I have some how jump past friend zone, relationship zone, hone phase zone and right into horrible marriage zone\" derrick told her and she started to walk away. Derrick was following her around and he demanded her to tell him how they were even married? The woman kept shouting at derrick \"we are not married!\" And derrick replied \"yeah but you are verbally abusing me and being nasty, this is what married couples do\" and the woman tried to run away but derrick followed her. He even tracked her all the way to her flat. He was now locked out of her block, but this only made him feel more married to this woman. \n\nHe would stalk this woman and watch her go in and out of her flat. He even got her flowers sent to her work place and flat, the more she denied him, the more it made derrick think that they were married. Then one day derrick spotted another woman and he asked her out straight away, but this other woman shouted at him to get lost. This made derrick think that he was also married to her, because in his mind, married couple verbally abuse each other. \n\nWhen he started following her around and the second woman literally started punching him, this only made derrick even more sure that he was married to this woman, as physical violence is a property of married couples, just like his parents. As he was following the second woman around, he completely forgot where he had hid the first woman's body who he also still thinks, is also his wife. \n\nSo women, if you are to reject derrick, do it gently.","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1677617195.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"My secret family has a secret family","author":"TheMidnightProfessor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11dmapb\/my_secret_family_has_a_secret_family\/","text":"I\u2019m a liar, a cheat, and without guilt.

His dad was working too late, and his mom was paranoid about it.\u00a0I made sure that Sam invited me over to his house every day, so I could do whatever I could to break them up, I put lipstick on his shirt, left love notes in his pants, I kept ringing the house and hanging up when his mom answered. \n\nIt only took a couple of months, Sam did not take it well, but luckily for him, he had me to help him through, and in his vulnerable time I made sure he knew who his real friends were, me.\u00a0 \n\nIt was kind of fun spreading all those rumors, about how it was his fault his dad left, and the people that supposedly started them. It didn't take long before he told me that I was the only one he could trust. He shunned everyone else, even his mom, he blamed her for everything. \n\nI had\u00a0planned on ruining his life and moving on, but it was so much fun I couldn't stop. I've controlled every part of his life since, he only lasted 2 years in collage before he suddenly got expelled, later I made sure he got the job of his dreams, then fucked it up for him.\u00a0 \n\nHis mom suddenly fell off a cliff one morning while out walking, and not long after that his dad was in a terrible accident, but he survived, if you can call spending the rest of your life on a ventilator surviving. \n\nDon't worry Sam is not going to have the same fate, I have plans, so many plans, and not just for him. For that pretty little wife of his too. \n\nI convinced her to secretly run away with me. The poor thing is sure we are going to some exotic island. But I have been renting this isolated cabin in the woods for the last few years. That I have been using for other ongoing projects, and she will make a good addition.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677511411.0,"comments":[{"author":"Sprattus_Sprattus","text":"Understandable, I also hate losing my property to make up for other people's irresponsibility.

And they must feed near-constantly, consuming perhaps thirty times their own bodyweight each day.\n\nIt is a miserable existence, made harder due to the sparseness of any nearby human populations, which is very necessary for the creatures to stay hidden.\u00a0\n\nContrary to rather romantic myths and legends, perpetuated ad infinitum, these creatures don't live in crumbling clifftop castles, or crypts. The largest gatherings are located in the Faroe Islands, of all places.\n\nThe locals call them \"trows\" and tend to regard them as a never-ending nuisance, kept at bay with garlic, which the creatures genuinely hate, though there is no medical explanation for this mystery.\u00a0\n\nThe rather charming green grass roofs of Faroese homesteads are festooned with crucifixes, too, in the more remote villages on the tinier islands, near the labyrinthine warrens of small sea-caves where the creatures shiver and starve all day, licking their little lips as they anticipate their evening's prey.\n\nOccasionally an optimistic tourist wanders too close to these clifftops, in the hope of procuring an idyllic Instagram image, with the expeditiously setting sun reflecting iridescent against the crashing waves below.\n\nAs their smartphone snaps shot after shot, the artist might imagine that the rapid flappings of leathery wings are merely the sounds of the guillemots or gulls nesting nearby.\n\nI am drifting into the realm of speculation here, as there are no reliable records of the encounter I now envisage, but one can assume that the tourist might initially mistake the creatures for fairies or pixies. The tourist might have been misled by tales of benevolent beings from a million children's picture-books.\n\nWhat we do know for certain is that the creatures are capable of tremendous strength, for though they may weigh just a few grammes, they can transport adult humans into their subterranean dwellings and keep their victim alive for months, limbs twisted and bones shattered, crammed or hammered deep down underground like a tent-peg.\u00a0\n\nSometimes skeletons are found upside-down, though I suppose that when a person is stored hundreds of feet deep, in constant agony and total darkness, \"up\" might be a rather abstract concept.\n\nHardly any tourists used to visit, but that is changing. The off-grid experience is the very definition of \"hipster\", and the thirst for the perfect photograph is insatiable, despite warnings from the Faroese. Judging by one joyous-looking young man's recent selfie, taken at dusk, high on the G\u00e1sadalur cliffs, the creatures are growing in number at an alarming rate.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677503702.0,"comments":[{"author":"korenbloemen","text":"Horrifyingly intriguing!","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1677507572.0},{"author":"A_Drunken_Panda","text":"\"The blood is the life!\"","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1677557690.0},{"author":"animejunkieforlife","text":"fantastic writing style (pun intended)","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678061986.0}]},{"title":"The Cathedral","author":"1000andonenites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11da1ni\/the_cathedral\/","text":"  \n\nOliver ran through the streets, coming to a dead stop at the sight of the cathedral burning up. \n\nSo Essie had finally done it.

The cathedral was his place, Essie was his lady. \n\nThe heat hit his face but he rushed into the burning old building, dodging the firemen and the policemen easily - he knew all the little back entrances and exits, having worked there all his life.\n\nThe back stair landing up to the main bell tower was still intact- he craned his neck up- \u201cEssie!\u201d he bellowed. He could hear the shouts of the firemen and roar of the fire, but coming from the distant. That was Essie\u2019s effect. Even though she was a ghost, she made everything around her appear distant and fuzzy. \n\nShe shimmered before him, and his heart contracted with love. Flames flickered about her face, reflecting from her green eyes. She smiled. \u201cI did it, Oliver. Burned this whole damn thing down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, my heart.

He thought of all the children she killed - children were small and easy enough for a ghost to manipulate. Once a while she would the muster enough power to push one over or through the banisters as they ran about in tourist school groups. They would fall down, down down, and smash on the stone floor below.  \n\nOliver had seen her do it as he went about his duties. The first time he was worried there would be an outcry, the cathedral would be closed. \n\nNothing happened. Children are clumsy little beasts, and tourist dollars are more valuable. Nobody really likes kids anyway. And Essie did not do it too often. \n\nEssie\u2019s face glowed with rage. \u201cChildren? Pah!\u201d and she turned sideways spitting in fury.

Worthless stone place! It deserves to burn to the ground!\u201d she shrieked. \n\nOliver felt the heat licking at his skin. He looked down. Tongues of flames ran up his shoes, his legs. He couldn\u2019t feel the pain yet. \n\n\u201cEssie?\u201d he whispered. \n\nSorrow replaced anger in Essie\u2019s face. She moved towards him, \u201cYou love me. I had to pay a price- to start the fire. You. Now I can heal, be free. You want that for me, yes?\u201d \n\nThe fire was engulfing Oliver.

Cody's legs shot up at each peak then slammed back with all his body weight on each descent. His movements were more like a gymnast's than a kid swinging on a swing set. He was using all of his might. Everything he had. Higher and higher the swing went. Cody's torso was flying just above the bar now and he showed no signs of stopping. The swing flew so high he almost felt dizzy. He threw his body back hard to gain one last surge of momentum. Then, just like that, right before Joel could ridicule him for being wrong, Cody swung over the bar.\n\nThe chain from the swing wrapped around the bar and fired Cody into the air like a slingshot.

She was with him driving the car when the accident happened, but she survived. At his funeral, I was lost looking through his memorial photos until my girlfriend nudged me to go see mom. I found her lying next to his body, gently caressing his face and fixing his hat.\n\nShe asked me to take a photo of them when she saw me, and I did. \n\nWe ended the funeral shortly after that.\n\nGrief has no timeline, and everyone copes with it differently, I understand that. But mom slept for three days straight afterward, refusing anything for food or drink.\n\nSo before I drove back to college, I asked mom's neighbor, aunt Sarah, to check on her and keep her company. I was glad to see the understanding on her face.\n\nFor weeks I checked on mom every day. And checked on her with aunt Sarah, too. But aunt Sarah only kept reporting countless worsening conditions at home and that she couldn't be of help any longer.\n\nI get it.\n\nBut when mom stopped answering my calls, I knew something had to change.\n\nI shared my worries with my girlfriend, and she offered to clean mom's house while I took mom on a getaway. I immediately booked us a weekend stay at a hotel by the beach.\n\nAnd today I drove my girlfriend to mom's house with a kiss on her forehead and the deepest gratitude in my heart.\n\nThen picked up mom with the hope this trip will bring her some peace of mind.\n\nMom isn\u2019t the type to be this quiet on car rides, but she seems content with the bag in her lap.\n\nI get it.\n\nNow I am driving us to the hotel. One of her favorite songs playing on the radio. She is happily humming it while rummaging through her bag next to me and fiddling with dad\u2019s hat. I turn the overhead light on for her.\n\n\u201cYou look just like your dad,\u201d she tells me, right before we reach the hotel. \u201cThis hat will fit you well as well.\u201d\n\nThen my eyes trail to her bag. Dad had a knack for wearing good clothes, and this hat would suit me just fine.\n\nMom lifts the hat again. And I see it on top of something dry and appalling to behold.\n\n\u201cYour dad said we\u2019d stay together till death do us part,\u201d she says, lifts the head, and looks into its blacked eyes. \u201cBut we\u2019re not both dead yet, are we, my love?.\u201d\n\nShe then looks back at me, and I start to feel dizzy. Her face curls into a teary smile as she puts dad\u2019s severed head closer to her face.\n\n\u201cBe so dear and take a photo of us.\u201d\n\nThen I hear some commotion. I look in front of me.

And unsurprisingly in these \"apartments\" you pay a small fortune to rent problems occur pretty frequently. This was especially true at my last dwelling. But the last straw was when my bathroom vent stopped working.\n \nEvery morning as I would get ready to take a shower before work I'd flip the switch for the exhaust vent above the shower to prevent the bathroom from getting steamy. One morning just as I'm getting acclimated to the warm water a horrific screeching sound erupted from the vent above me. This brutal interruption caused me to jump out and flip off the switch in anger.\n\nI tried to ignore it. Every morning I would pray the vent would work normally. Every time just as I started to feel secure the same eardrum shattering wail would fill the tiny bathroom before turning off the vent.\n\nI had had enough. I reached out to my landlord asking him to come over and fix the problem. When he mentioned he'd get around to it after the various backlog of other tenant complaints I offered to broker to have a repair man come over and bill it to him. He was over later that afternoon. \n\nAs we were both standing there in my cramped bathroom my landlord flipped the switch. Nothing. He flipped it back and forth again. Still nothing. We both shared a puzzled look before he pulled out screw driver and began taking off the switch's panel.\n\n\"Well here's your problem\", he said.\n \n\"The wires here are disconnected.\"\n\nI looked at him and at the detached wires and the color began to drain from my face.\n\n\"Funny now that I think of it the last tenant said the vent just up and stopped working one day.

I mean, sure, for some the answer is obvious. Team \u201cDog\u201d loves loyalty and unconditional love. Dogs always first to greet you with unrestrained enthusiasm. Cats? Well, they\u2019re more chill, without a doubt. With them, you mostly just enjoy life together.\n\nI decided that I didn\u2019t have a preference. I love them both equally. That\u2019s why I have both. Adopting two pets was the best decision I ever made. Thanks mostly to my partner, James, who recommended that I get some.  \n\nMittens, my cat, is a pet I adopted from my buddy who\u2019s a paramedic. He temporarily adopted Mittens after a call responding to a deceased elderly woman without family. Apparently, the call shook him up but he adopted Mittens anyway, who proved to be sweet but slightly demanding. His girlfriend was allergic, so when he asked whether I could take him, I instantly agreed.\n\nFearless, my dog, is a fearsome looking German Shepherd. Unfortunately, his name is a misnomer. He\u2019s quite a timid dog and too loving. He was supposed to serve on the police force, like me, but was quickly determined to be \u201ctoo much of a \u2018good boy\u2019\u201d. He was perfect for me though, I adopted him without hesitation.\n\nOne thing was clear about both Mittens and Fearless: Mittens was the alpha.\n\n\\--\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy world out there out, man. It\u2019s kill or be killed. The world is just survival of the fittest\u201d, my partner was telling me this on our call to a domestic disturbance. He\u2019s way too dark, but it comes with territory. We\u2019ve both seen horrible things.\n\nThe incident happened so fast that I still can\u2019t quite remember it. We showed up at the house and spoke with the couple. The man, calm at first, pulled a gun and shot at us. I got hit on my side with the bullet pierced my gut. \n\nSeveral gruesome surgeries later and I was recouping at home. I may have been single but Mittens and Fearless looked after me during my recovery.  At least, they tried to with lots of snuggles.\n\n\u201cCall us if you have other symptoms. This is important Officer Williams.\u201d, the nurse said as I was discharged. Hospitals\u2026 just too cautious.  The only symptoms that I had were just a little numbness and tingling in my arms and legs.\n\n\\--\n\nSomething is wrong. I wake up groggily and try to sit up. My body doesn\u2019t respond. Even breathing seems difficult. I try to wiggle my toes and they don\u2019t respond. Or maybe just slightly.\n\nMittens jumps up on my chest, clearly ready for his breakfast. He\u2019s purring but clearly agitated.\n\nI try to shout for help but barely a whisper comes out.\n\n***I\u2019ll feed you later Mittens***, I unsuccessfully try to whisper.\n\nMittens start licking my face affectionately. At least, I thought it was affectionately until he sinks his sharp feline teeth directly into my silently screaming face.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677440288.0,"comments":[{"author":"MarineroRon","text":"Hey Everyone.

I went back to my car and grabbed my spelunking equipment. There was a musty wet smell that hit my nose the farther I climbed in. I was enjoying the quiet, serene sounds of water dripping and echo of my feet as they hit the hard rock of the floor. \n\nMy headlamp came across a cavern my light could barely penetrate, so I decided to explore. I hunkered down to all fours and crawled into the hole, pulling my bag behind me. It was getting tighter as I had to army crawl on the sharp edges of stone allowing me through. My shoulders made it through as the opening became wider as a soft strand brushed against my face.\n\nI reached up to feel what it was and grabbed onto a lock of black silky smooth hair hanging from the ceiling. I gagged as some of it got into my mouth. My light was causing reflections everywhere as shiny strands dangled around me.\n\nSudden pain sliced through my calf causing me to stumble back. I could feel a warm sticky substance trickling down my pants as a piercing screech filled the area. I found the hole I came through and scurried out as fast as I could. I made it back to the main part of the cave, but was limping. Pebbles dropping into water matched my every step.\n\nI made it back to my car with a headache brewing and a slight blur at the corner of my eye and a cramp in my leg. I managed a fitful sleep that night that only a pitch black darkness allowed. I woke up nauseated and groggy. A black vein of hair seeping out of my leg wound. The splitting headache getting worse as it caused tension in my neck and shoulders.\n\nI threw up a ball of black fur into the hall of my apartment and it skittered away to the stairwell. \n\nI mustered up the courage to go to the hospital and the doctor said I may lose my leg. He was wondering how I could let an infection grow this out of control. He said that if I hadn't come in for the headache, the leg might have killed me. I have surgery scheduled for tomorrow morning. \n\nAnother one of those black things came out as I lay on the hospital bed. I'll tell them about it before my appointment, I forgot to tell them today.

Pulling back the curtains, I peered outside. There, Sara Beth stood, her shoulder-length brown hair a mess of tangles, and a wide, toothy smile on her face.\n\n\u201cYou coming, Benny?\u201d her expression asked, though she said nothing.\u00a0\n\nIt only took me a split second to slip my pants on; then I was through the window, standing barefoot in the dew-covered grass. Then we were off, running through the backyard toward the dense, wooded area beyond. The trees stood so close and thick that the moonlight couldn\u2019t penetrate them.\n\n\u201cWait up, Sara Beth!\u201d I\u2019d called out. She just laughed. Sara Beth did like to laugh a lot, but this one seemed off. A bit manic, maybe. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Beneath my feet, twigs snapped and stabbed into my soles.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer, but I already knew. There was a clearing in the middle of these woods that we used as our base of operations\u2026but only during daylight hours. It was our special place where we\u2019d spent many hours building forts, \u201csword-fighting\u201d, and simply talking. It was also where we\u2019d shared a kiss, one cool October afternoon.\u00a0\n\nWe hadn\u2019t been to the clearing in a long time; not since Sara Beth had gotten sick. She\u2019d been bedridden for weeks. In the beginning, I would just call out my window, and she\u2019d come to hers and wave. Sometimes, my mom would let me talk to her on the phone, but she didn\u2019t let me visit. She said Sara Beth was too contagious.\n\nBut then there came a time when Sara Beth stopped coming to the window. When I called, there was no answer. My mom told me to stop making such a racket and that I\u2019d wake the dead with all that noise. That\u2019s why I started to call for her at night when my parents were asleep. Sometimes I\u2019d see her bedroom curtains rustle. Or maybe it was wishful thinking.\n\nThat night, sprinting blindly, I could still hear Sara Beth\u2019s retreating footsteps as they pounded across the forest floor ahead of me. She seemed to possess a speed not of her own. It was all I could do to keep up. \u201cWait, Sara Beth!\u201d I called.\n\nWhen, panting, I finally reached the clearing, my feet scratched and bloody, a single beam of moonlight shone down upon my friend. No, it shone *through* her. She faced me, her awkward smile glinting in the pale light.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSara Beth?\u201d I asked uneasily. In the surrounding darkness, I felt an unknown number of eyes staring at me in silence.\n\nShe was there\u2026I blinked\u2026and she was gone.\u00a0\n\nThey said Sara Beth couldn\u2019t have come to my window that night; she\u2019d passed in her sleep around nine.

I had been worried that I might need a c-section, but everything was perfectly normal. It was a slightly sad occasion though because of the fact the father wasn\u2019t there. I understood though; he was very busy, working on making the world the best place for his daughter to grow up in.\n\nWhen I got to hold her, I knew she would change the world. She came out with brilliant blue eyes and a lovely crown of golden hair. I\u2019ve been told her father had golden hair like that when he was younger. She would probably lose it, most babies do, but it was an amazing start, she looked so lovely. She would grow up beautiful, strong, confident, and people would grow to love her as much as I did. Just like her father.\n\nI was sad I couldn\u2019t put his name on the birth certificate; people wouldn\u2019t understand. They can be so close minded, and hateful. I was thrown out of the church I had grown up in when they found out I was pregnant out of wedlock. We weren\u2019t married by choice; he never did like those kinds of ceremonies. But it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve found another church already to belong to, that accepts me and her father. I feel more welcome there than I ever have.\n\nI kept thinking about the certificate. I just had to put some sign she was his on it\u2026 Ah! I smiled as I realized what to do.\n\nThe nurse looked at it and smiled. \u201cNevaeh,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me think of her father,\u201d I stated as I cradled dear, sweet, Nevaeh. \u201cHe can\u2019t be here, but she\u2019ll have that tie with him. It\u2019s heaven backwards.\u201d\n\nThe nurse looked at me slightly oddly. I could tell she was mentally shrugging, probably assuming I was still somewhat loopy from the painkillers they gave me. But I was thinking very clearly. Her father loves word play, and so do I. Nevaeh probably will too; it\u2019s a fine skill to have, especially when you\u2019re trying to convince people of your cause. And she\u2019ll be great at that. I can see it now; her making all sorts of friends in high and low places, her lovely voice being heard all over the news.\n\nShe\u2019ll be famous, and powerful, and will have her enemies trodden on by the horsemen and the armies of her father as she claims her birthright one day. And I will watch, and be so proud of both of them, as they storm the very gates of power that keeps her father from what he rightly deserves.\n\nWordplay is such a funny thing sometimes. People don\u2019t tend to think of it. Like how backwards can also mean opposite.

So he took me to his cellar and he locked the door and he told me that spiderman would save me. I was so excited to be saved by spiderman and I couldn't wait until spiderman broke through those doors and saved me. \n\nDays went by and spiderman hadn't saved me yet.

I always wanted to be like spiderman but if I could atleast meet him in person, that would be enough. Getting saved is just as thrilling as doing the saving and I'm just waiting for the door to get pounded in by spiderman. People get angry when police break through the doors but when superheroes do it, it's a different story. \n\nThen the marvel executive started speaking through the doors in a girly voice and he said \"depression is a super power, it makes one brave enough to set themselves on fire and even cut themselves, and go through the pain\" and then he unlocked the door and he captain America with him but he was over weight, horrendous teeth, bad odour and in general he looked bad. \n\nIn a girls voice the marvel executive said \"do you want to get rescued by captain america\" and captain America started giggling \n\nI said \"I want to get rescued by spiderman\" and then they both locked and locked the door. More days went by and the marvel executive spoke through the door in a girly voice and said \"spiderman doesn't exist, captain America doesn't exist and no super heroes exist, they are just fictional comic books.

Above all that, he happens to be incredibly wealthy, being one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the 21st century. \n\nMost of that money is used to support charities, the rest he gladly spends on spoiling his wife, for whom he\u2019d do almost anything. \n\nSo when Mrs. Smith expressed the desire to have a child, Mr. Smith gladly obliged, even if he himself had no interest in them. He does love her so very much. \n\nIt only took a single call from Mr. Smith to arrange a visit to the local orphanage, which welcomed the couple with open arms \u2013 perhaps slightly influenced by the enormous donation the man had made to them a mere few days ago. \n\nIn less than an hour Mrs. Smith had found the perfect little girl. Her hair was as golden as hers and her eyes a natural, emerald green she dreamed of having. Mr. Smith hadn\u2019t paid any attention to any of the children, but took the effort the greet the shy girl with a kind smile.\n\nAnd with some quick paperwork, another donation and a more than tearful goodbye from her caretakers, they were on their way. \n\nTo any outsider it\u2019d be hard to say who was more excited as they neared the luxurious home, Mrs. Smith or the girl herself, though Mr. Smith knew the truth as he saw the subtle tears of joy glistening in his wife\u2019s eyes. \n\nFor that same reason he decided to leave the two in peace once they arrived. After all, he believed their marriage would only grow stronger if they each had their own interests, and this particular one he did not share with her. \n\nInstead he started reading a magnificent book, worked in their enchanting garden, took some business calls and eventually retired to their bedroom, waiting for his beautiful wife to come join him. \n\nIt would be a few hours before she finally did appear before him, wearing something she knew would make her husband more than happy. \n\nBlissfully she crawled into bed with him, as he sighed and ran his fingers through her hair, picking at the dried up blood that still remained. His mind wandered to the young girl, who undoubtedly was lying lifelessly in their basement - just like the others before her. \n\nFor a second, he did feel incredibly bad for her, but his wife was skilled at making him move on from thoughts like that.\n\n\u2018Perhaps we can get a boy next time,\u2019 she murmured, wrapping herself around her husband and planting a soft, tender kiss on his cheek. \n\nMrs. Smith is not a good mother.\n\nLuckily, Mr. Smith is a good husband.\n\n\u2018Of course, dear.\u2019","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677345602.0,"comments":[{"author":"TryHardKenichi","text":"Happy wife, happy life.

But Boy felt hot and scratchy inside his stupid snow pants. His thick mittens made him feel as if he had no hands- he couldn\u2019t feel the controller he had sneaked into his pockets. The hot itchiness inside his clothes clashed with the wind on his face. The sound of children screaming filled the air. So different from the calm music of Mole. Mole was always running from one level to the next, showing sharp teeth. Whenever he picked up a gold ring, he did a little leap of joy. Boy sometimes put down his controller and leaped along with Mole.\n\nHe looked up at Carly. \u201cCan we go now?\u201d Carly yelped as if she had stepped on a Crocodile: \u201cWhat? But you haven\u2019t sledded! So much fun!\u201d\n\nBoy looked down the long snowy hill, covered with screaming sliding children. It did not look fun. Why did he have to slide down a hill? Carly repeated: \u201cIt\u2019s fun! So much fun!\u201d She yelped at Martin, the other daycare teacher, \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t like sledding!\u201d They cackled and Martin screamed back \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun! We\u2019re going to sled everyday!\u201d\n\nBoy\u2019s insides hurt. He wanted to be not there. He needed to be with Mole. Jump over Crocodiles and fight Weasels. That was fun. Not lying on the snow and sliding down a hill. This was stupid.\n\nCarly and Martin were barking out instructions. Lie like this. Here. Don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not nice. Careful. No. Rylan, stop it. Tailor, you won\u2019t get a turn. Bailey, be quiet. Anna, go now.\n\nBoy gripped the controller in his pocket and pushed the stick, and through the screaming children on the hill, he glimpsed a different flash of movement. It was Mole.\n\nCarly tugged at his hat and pants and thick snow coat. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn! Aren\u2019t you excited?\u201d. \n\nBoy muttered \u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u201d. \n\nMartin cried \u201cAre you scared? Sledding is safe! It\u2019s fun!\u201d \n\nBoy knew Martin was lying and sledding was not safe, because he knew a boy with a broken arm from sledding but everybody said it was fun. Rylan flew off with a big whooping yell. Anna disappeared with a high-pitched scream.\n\nMole was running up the hill on his two hind legs, his sharp-toothed smile glinting. Boy moved the controller, making him dodge the sledding children easily. Oh that was close\u2013 he almost crashed into Anna. But Boy was so skilful.\n\nMartin prodded him: \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, here\u2019s your sled.\u201d\n\nHe just needed two more seconds. Last bit of hill. So many children. Mole was dodging them but he did hit two or three, and they were lying still in the snow. Negative points. Mole was a second away. Boy lay down in the sled, one hand still working furiously.\n\n\u201cReady? I\u2019m gonna push, ok? One- Two-\u201c\n\nMartin never said Three. Mole got him, and then got Carly. Boy won.

Everyone\u2019s eyes darted towards the newcomer in a room of stillness or somebody\u2019s waving hand in a crowd, so I assumed everyone shared the same reason for this. For most people the instinct is part of some sort of survival mechanism alerting you to something new and possibly dangerous. For me, it\u2019s because the faster something moves the clearer I can see it.\n\nMy normal vision is a little below average, corrected with glasses. But if an object moves quickly in my field of vision then I can see it in incredible detail. It never really came up though, before the seizures. Everyone thinks they\u2019re normal until they\u2019re told otherwise and I was no different.\n\nI got my first seizure on a school sports day. I was only just a teenager and I\u2019d heard of epilepsy but nobody I new had it. I collapsed and started shaking so fast I was almost vibrating, scaring my friends but terrifying me more.\n\nI\u2019d never tried moving quickly whilst staying in the same place before and thanks to the seizure I was finding out what that does to my vision. I saw the sports field in unbearable detail and hidden beyond normal sight there were these unfocused *things* that only lurked around the people who were upset. I looked at them and I knew they saw me too.\n\nThere was no point in telling anyone. Normal people don\u2019t see things like that. So I kept it a secret and it ate away at me as these things followed me into my adult life, feeding off the people around me.\n\nMost people I saw with one of these things talking to them were crying. The only two I saw touched by them\u2026 they didn\u2019t make it.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why I married Gerard in the end. I knew he didn\u2019t really love me but if I attracted creatures like that then I must be broken, surely? My seizures called them to me. It was like as soon as my head shook fast enough to see them I was a beacon. They crowded me and fed off any bystanders as I wondered when they\u2019d finally finish me off.\n\nUntil Gerard slapped me, that is. The pain wasn\u2019t new but usually I took it silently so my squeal earned contempt.\n\n\u201cReally? I barely touched you, you attention seeking bitch.\u201d\n\nI understood then and we have a lamp that is so broken that it can trigger my seizures. Gerard says he\u2019ll fix it so I am neither allowed to complain nor fix it myself. I clicked the switch and stared at my husband.\n\nThe creatures came quickly at first and fed on the bystander I\u2019d provided. All the pain he\u2019d caused me was given back and then some. I should thank him really, he helped me figure out that I\u2019ll always be safe from these monsters.\n\nAll they want from me is to be seen.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677385907.0,"comments":[{"author":"bloodoftheforest","text":"Everybody needs to be seen sometimes, even extradimensional beings that drain the life force out of humans.\n\nIf you liked this story then I have a subreddit r\/Leavesandink and am currently working on [a collection of stories related to senses.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Leavesandink\/comments\/111nt3m\/the_senses_collection\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)","upvotes":19,"created_utc":1677386224.0},{"author":"SadMaryJane","text":"That ending, particularly the last line, really struck me.

My eyes have always bulged, and I\u2019ve never had fingers.\u00a0\n\nI scurry around the house and find a dead woman in a bed.

I will never forget it; I was standing on a ledge and some invisible force was trying to drag me off. I had a crippling fear of heights, so I was sure I was going to die. Then suddenly for no apparent reason, I realized I was dreaming and let go, but instead of falling I took flight, for a few moments I felt like a superhero. Unfortunately, shortly afterward my dream started falling apart and I woke.\u00a0 \n\nThe older I got the more frequently my lucid dreams happened and the better I got at controlling them. It was like being inside a video game, I could create whole cities with the blink of an eye, then destroy them with a wave of my hand. I could shoot hordes of zombies with my fingers, then turn them into people and have a real conversation with them. \n\nThe sad thing is, they actually think they are not real, and if you try telling them, they get real angry and unpredictable. So, I usually just play along with them and let them believe whatever they want, which is beneficial, they can tell some amazing stories, that I am ashamed to say, I've been stealing. \n\nNot all of them, only the scary ones, but it's hard, not everyone had a horror story, and I have a limited amount of time in the dream world. So, I begin to wonder if there was another way, like reading books or magazines. Unfortunately, I soon realized that the language part of our brain is asleep when you dream, and everything is gibberish.  \n\nBut since I was able to do everything else in my dreams, I thought I'd give it a go anyway, so I got a pencil and began writing the word, \u201cfood\u201d on a piece of paper. It was a lot harder than I thought, but I did it. It took a long long time before it became any real use to me; it was like learning to read and write all over again. But reading books never really worked out, they were just too long, I needed short stories, or I'd wake up before the ending.\u00a0 \n\nThen I thought where's the best place to find stories like that. The internet of course, and that's where I found this site, and ever since,\u00a0I have been stealing stories and posting them in the real world. Which I suppose... is not really bad, since it\u2019s my brain that is making all this up in the first place. \n\nWhy am I telling you this, you might ask? Well, the answer is simple, I just want to see what will happen when your reality starts to fall apart.

She was teleported instantaneously from the departure gate in Cape Canaveral, Florida to the arrival gate in Paris, France. She had left in the early afternoon and arrived to witness the sunset, but nonetheless, not a second had passed as she moved from one timezone to another. At the arrival gate, Stephanie was greeted with champagne and uproarious applause. She was the first telenaut. The technology worked, and the world around her would never be the same.\n\n\nPerfecting the technology to teleport an object through space was an arduous task for the team of scientists who spent more than twenty years on the project. It started simple enough - teleporting a ballpoint pen from one corner of the room to another - until eventually the tech was tested on live mice. The first three of these trials ended in disaster - one mouse passed through the teleportation gates seemingly unscathed, only to die within seconds; another mouse came out of the arrival gate with its eyes and its guts boiled to a gooey sap; and the third mouse simply vanished, never arriving at the second gate. Eventually, the issue was correctly identified and soon fixed, and twenty consecutive trials proved successful. Before long, it was time to test the technology on a living person.\n\n\nStephanie Howard was chosen as she had been the first human to step foot on Mars. She was ecstatic to top her own personal record. The only thing bigger than being the first person on Mars, she felt, was to be the first person teleported through space. After the successful mission from Florida to France in a flash, she was once again hailed as a hero, celebrated all around the new world.\u00a0\n\n\nBut back home, the teleportation gate in Cape Canaveral was shut down. Stephanie's immediate family was given an undisclosed amount of money, either to compensate for their loss or to keep them from talking to the press. The teleportation project was abandoned, but the gate in Paris was left active with the futile hope that Stephanie Howard would one day pass through it.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd somewhere across the vastness of the unknowable, Stephanie Howard watched the setting of a sun that was not her own.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677366041.0,"comments":[{"author":"Beginning-Milk-8781","text":"Very interesting story.

They only want to go unnoticed until he leaves.\n\nThe bartender shakily pours two inches of whiskey, and sets the glass in front of him. The horse eyes him for a moment, leaning over the counter slowly. The horse bares his teeth, large and yellowed incisors grinding together amidst a scoff of hot breath. He keeps leaning until one of his void-like eyes is an inch from his face. The next words spoken by the horse are whispered in a sinister tone, but everyone manages to hear.\n\n\u201c\ud835\udcf1\u15dd\ud835\udd4e. \ud835\udcc2\uff41\u0e20\u04af. \ud835\udd4e\u4e47\u4e47\u0137\u0e23?\u201d His tortured voice groans, and the bartender freezes.\n\nEveryone, including the bartender, shifts uncomfortably. He chews his lip for a moment, unsure of what to say. His pupils slowly dilate, and he answers on command.\n\n\u201cFour.\u201d The bartender says, tears streaming down both cheeks.\n\n\u201c\ud835\udc54\u15dd\u15dd\ud835\udcd3. \ud835\udc2f\u4e47\u5c3a\u04af \ud835\udc54\u15dd\u15dd\ud835\udcd3.\u201d The horse seethes, before picking up his glass of whiskey.\n\nThe horse\u2019s pale, stapled-on hands touch the glass fondly, caressing it like a sacred chalice. The bartender returns to normal, and everyone grimaces in what\u2019s about to come.\n\nThe horse puts the cup in his mouth and chews, an explosion of whiskey and glass grinding against his oversized teeth. They flinch as he works his jaw, the sound of the glass shredding his gums and grinding into powder like nails on a rusted chalkboard.\n\nWithout a word the horse leaves, and the awkward silence slowly turns back like nothing happened. Everyone looks happy.\n\nEveryone except the bartender, who thinks of his wife at home. Thirty-six weeks pregnant.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677289777.0,"comments":[{"author":"seasonalspirits","text":"I hope his wife's condition is...*Stable...*","upvotes":352,"created_utc":1677295000.0},{"author":"lenoodlenugget","text":"When you said the horse had hands I thought of the deer with hands from adventure time\n\n![gif](giphy|Qld1cd6a6QlWw)","upvotes":309,"created_utc":1677303592.0},{"author":"Lovingbutdifferent","text":"*whispers*\n\nWhat the fuck what the fuck what the *fuck*","upvotes":263,"created_utc":1677296189.0},{"author":"decorativegentleman","text":"This made me pleasantly uncomfortable.

Even though she had never been there before, the Worm inside her knew exactly where to go, and she moved purposefully through the maze of University buildings.\n\n\u201cClaudia! What on earth are you doing here? Where is Paul?\u201d It was Gordon, Paul\u2019s best friend and lab-mate, walking across the empty shadowy quad towards her.\n\nClaudia and Gordon often met socially, and he was the cause of many lovers\u2019 quarrels, where she presented an ultimatum: her or Gordon. She understood that Paul and Gordon worked together, but did they need to spend every spare moment of time outside the lab together also? Her animosity wasn\u2019t helped by her gnawing feeling that Gordon, despite his respectful behaviour towards her, disliked her. She felt he thought Paul was dating \u201cbeneath\u201d him, and should have remained entangled with their fellow lab girls. Those girls with their un-made-up faces and incomprehensible talk, who had been his and Gordon\u2019s usual type before Paul met and fell hard for Claudia. Their quarrels always ended in hot make-up sex, and the purported threat of break up never happened.\n\nGordon reached her and grabbed her arm, turning her towards him. It was untypical of him, as he was generally aloof, if unfailingly polite towards her -which inevitably made her frequent outbursts against him sound paranoid. However now the coldness had vanished, replaced by urgency: \u201cClaudia! I need to talk to Paul. Something has terrible happened - our specimens broke loose. Is he ok?\u201d\n\nClaudia snatched her arm away.\n\nGordon looked at her face intently, illuminated by a greenish glow in the dark. \u201cClaudia? Are you ok?\u201d\n\nClaudia stared back at him. The green glow shone through her eyes, her fair hair, and skin. She took a step back, never taking her eyes off him. Paul was forgotten.\n\n\u201cClaudia? What is it?\u201d Gordon\u2019s voice was no longer urgent and sharp, but soft- almost tender. He was painfully aware of the crush he had had on her since the moment he had laid on eyes on her on Paul\u2019s arm, chatting warmly, like women in TV shows, beautiful and lively, like no other woman he had ever seen in real life before. He had tried to hide his feelings for his best friend\u2019s girlfriend under an aloof demeanour, but now, looking at her glowing in the dark quad, he was unable to deny anymore his longing for her.\n\nClaudia reached out and gripped his shoulders. Her grip was strong- stronger than any woman\u2019s touch and he felt his body instantly reacting to her grasp. He dipped his face towards her for the kiss he thought was inevitably coming, and she opened her mouth \u2013 and kept on opening it - wider than humanly possible. The Worm\u2019s head slithered out towards him, baring its humanoid teeth in his face. A scream of terror broke from him as the Worm-Woman engulfed his body, and he felt himself consumed by its horrible desires.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677363182.0,"comments":[{"author":"whiskeygambler","text":"Well, I guess that answers the question of \u201cwould you still love me if I were a worm?\u201d","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1677430300.0}]},{"title":"That Funky Monkey","author":"MarineroRon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11btksr\/that_funky_monkey\/","text":"\u201cThe answer is Joseph, Dr. Hooke. Surely, even someone with head damage like you can understand.\u201d\n\nThe chimp laughs like only a chimp can, hopping and spinning in smug satisfaction. The rest of the scientists also laughed, although less ebulliently.  Dr. Hooke though did not laugh. She wasn\u2019t amused at all at the common dig poking fun at her PHD as \u2018Permanent Head Damage\u2019. \n\nThe question had been one of those gotcha riddles asking the chimp what the name was of Joseph\u2019s parents\u2019 fourth son, after naming the other three sons. Most try to find some pattern to detect the answer when the clear answer is obvious. \n\nDr. Hooke could not deny the progress the monkey had made. The neural implant they installed in the chimp was working better than they could have dreamed. A necessary step before application in humans.\n\n\u201cDr. Hooke, what are you writing down?\u201d, the chimp spoke with it\u2019s thought-to-speech device.  \u201cDr. Hooke, would it be all right if I wrote something down as well? I would like to write my thoughts down just like you.\u201d\n\nThe other scientists looked at Dr. Hooke\n\n\u201cSure, Mr. Abe. But be careful, please do not get over excited\u2026\u201d\n\nShe sits at the table where Mr. Abe the monkey is and provides him with a pencil and paper. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see here, Dr. Hooke. It appears you are jotting down notes on my performance and mood. Various other metrics are being applied and checked on in regards to progress with the device. Let me help you.\u201d\n\nAbe starts to jot down the same thing Dr. Hooke writes. Admittedly, it is incredibly impressive that Abe can do this at all. He applies the same style and even applies a graph in the margin demonstrating his interpretation.\n\nThe other scientists are clearly impressed, they nod and smile at how impressed they are with Abe.\n\nDr. Hooke is also impressed. The only problem is \u2026 Abe\u2019s notes are just not as good as hers. Sure, it\u2019s impressive this monkey can copy this down and interpret what she wrote\u2026 but, why the fawning over this monkey?\n\n\u201cDr. Hooke, in the future is it true that humans will also have devices like mine? Even with these devices though, perhaps that won\u2019t be enough to compete with automation replacing most human jobs. It seems like most humans will have to purse artistic ventures like writing and art.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s possible Abe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I believe so. This means the competition for most things will be greater. Most people\u2019s art will go unnoticed and disregarded due to the massive scale of competition. Interesting, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that Abe.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake you for example, you are the lead of this project, but you likely won\u2019t get any recognition. Others are doing the same thing right now. No accolades are coming your way\u2026.\u201d\n\nAbe the monkey laughs, jumps up and quickly stabs the pencil in Dr. Hooke\u2019s neck before any of the other scientists can react.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677353818.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Basement","author":"Spongebob_Sp050199","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11bxs3u\/the_basement\/","text":"You're in the living room, playing video games with your dog laying on the floor next to you, a thunderstorm crashing outside. You're both relaxing, when suddenly, your dog's head and ears perk up and it starts growling while staring in one direction. You pause your game and turn your head to look in the direction of where your dog's head is pointing. Its staring at the basement door. You listen for anything coming from the basement. Nothing. You grab your phone and with your dog by your side, you try flicking the light switch at the top of the basement stairs, but nothing happens. The light bulb down there must've burned out.\n\nSuddenly, the whole house goes dark, the only light being the faint light illuminating from the street lights outside. 'Ah great,' you think, 'a fuse must've blown thanks to the storm.' Being home alone, other than your furry friend, doesn't help the situation much. You turn on the flashlight on your phone, and you feel a sense of dread flow through you as you look at your phone battery. Only 5%. You must've forgotten to charge your phone today.\n\nYou try to find another flashlight around your house, but there doesn't seem to be any. So, with your dying phone, your dog, and a long and sharp kitchen knife you grabbed from the knife block in your kitchen, you hesitantly start to make your way down the basements steps. You have your dog on a leash, and it's a good thing you did, because your dog keeps yanking and snarling.\n\nThen you feel a wave of fear wash over you as your phone dies. Now it's pitch black down there, the basement only being lit by the occasional lightning strike outside. You can feel your heart drop to your stomach as you look to your left and look at the basement window. It's been shattered, and it doesn't look like it was an accident. Suddenly, you lose grip on your dog's leash as it runs into the darkness until you can't see it anymore. You can still hear it barking.  Then you're shocked and terrified by what you hear. Or rather, what you don't hear. Your dog. You don't like how it's barking abruptly stops. Then you feel heavy breathing down your neck.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677364270.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I Could Kill Someone Today","author":"GuyAwks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11bbomw\/i_could_kill_someone_today\/","text":"\u201cOh, I swear, I could *kill* someone today!\u201d\n\nI\u2019d utter it while carpooling Lucas to his soccer practice after some bozo cut me off.

That afternoon, Jorge had been spotted sprawled in my backyard by nosy neighbors, a knife in his chest.\n\nAll the people I knew were called in as character witnesses for the trial. Unfortunately for me, none could deny I had a knack for blurting out casual threats of murder. Some utterances were even captured on phone recordings and meeting logs.\n\nThe media showed me no mercy. \u201cCould you kill someone *today*, Scary Mary?\u201d reporters sneered outside the courthouse. My rage issues were the smoking gun in the prosecution\u2019s case, who argued that I was an unstable, demanding workaholic and danger to society. It didn\u2019t help that my fingerprints were on the murder weapon; my own cooking utensil.\n\nTo them, it was an open-and-shut second-degree murder case. To me, it was an injustice that ruined my entire life\u2014that I\u2019d brought on myself.\n\nOh, why couldn\u2019t I have just controlled my big mouth, I thought endlessly as I languished in a jail cell for a crime I didn\u2019t commit. Years later, I still didn\u2019t know who killed Jorge. Why would they do it? Was it to frame me? Was it as punishment for me being so unpleasant?\n\nToday, I finally learned the answers when someone paid me a visit in prison.\n\nAs they stared through glass and confessed their crime into the telephone, it all came together. The times I\u2019d shouted that phrase when they were sitting in the car, or standing next to me in a queue, or waiting in my office, or eating at the dinner table. The times they\u2019d soaked it up like a sponge. Someone *did* get the wrong idea.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you proud, Mom?\u201d my young son Lucas chirped in an inspired voice.\n\n\u201c*I* can kill someone today, too!\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677298531.0,"comments":[{"author":"PorkrindsMcSnacky","text":"It\u2019s like an even darker version of that classic anti-drug PSA \u201cFrom you, all right!

It hung in the attic of the old mansion, where no one had gone for years. But when Jenna and her friends found it, they were instantly captivated.\n\nIt was a portrait of a woman, dressed in an old-fashioned gown, with a wide-brimmed hat and a stern expression. Her eyes seemed to follow Jenna and her friends as they walked around the room.\n\nAs the days went by, Jenna couldn't shake the feeling that the painting was somehow alive. She couldn't explain it, but every time she looked at it, she felt a chill run down her spine.\n\nOne night, Jenna woke up to find the painting in her room. She tried to scream, but no sound came out. The woman in the painting started to move, her mouth opening as if to speak.\n\nJenna was paralyzed with fear. She couldn't move, couldn't scream, couldn't do anything. The woman stepped out of the painting and started to walk towards her.\n\nSuddenly, Jenna was transported to a different time and place. She was in the same mansion, but everything was different. The walls were stained with blood, and the air was thick with the scent of death.\nThe woman from the painting was there, standing in front of Jenna. Her eyes were empty, and she didn't speak. She just stared at Jenna with a cold, unfeeling gaze.\n\nJenna tried to run, but she couldn't move. The woman started to walk towards her, her steps slow and deliberate.\n\nJust as the woman was about to touch Jenna, she woke up. She was back in her own bed, in her own room. But the painting was still there, staring at her with those empty eyes.\n\nJenna knew she had to get rid of the painting. She called a friend to help her, and they took it to a thrift store to donate it.\n\nBut as Jenna was leaving the store, she saw something that made her blood run cold. The woman from the painting was standing outside, staring at her with those same cold, unfeeling eyes.\n\nFrom that day on, Jenna never saw the painting again.

As soon as your eyes open, the silver heavenly oculus casts its ferrous stare down upon you. A great fear arises within the depths of your heart for the impossibly foreign sounds are violating the silence once more and they are getting closer. The pale white dread forces you into an upright position as the melody of perdition echoes again, stronger, closer, inching nearer and nearer with each movement of a forgotten fallen abominable deity's movement. This orchestra of otherworldly frenzy can only mean one thing and while your mind drifts to a distant place and in a different time where you once more endure the sight of your relative being dismantled, dissolved and devoured until there is nothing left - no flesh, no blood, no sinew nor bone; your legs begin running.\n\nAs you run an ocean of living panic takes center stage. Your sisters and brothers, your mother and father, everyone you've called family scatter. You are left behind as the hecatoncheirean poetry draws painfully close to you. Instinctively, you turn back and your heart almost skips a beat. Behind you; a grotesque amalgamation of muscle arrayed in strange mounds supported on ever stranger shapes, hairy manes and teeth. An arachnid formation of eyes glisten at you - they hunger. The thing behind you is a legion and a singular organism both at once. It is so structured and yet amorphous both in the same. It is a singular ravenous maw and many hungering mouths. It is the swarm, the host, the angel of death itself and there is no escaping its murderous lust.\n\nIts moans and shrieks and coughing and whooping laughter and draining the life right from inside your form. You run and run and run, but one of your legs gives out \u2013 for a fraction of a second and a sharp pain, unmatched by anything other than the nauseating noise all around you tears through your pelvis. You fall the ground, dust creeping into your facial orifices as you try to get back up, but the pain only gets worse. It burns through abdomen and you feel something snapping and falling out.\n\nOne Lernaean Myrmidonhead clasp its jaw around your organs and the others followed suit. You try to fight, but there is no point. Kicking and screaming seems only to arouse the beast, encouraging it to sink itself deeper and deeper into your body. The pain slowly takes over everything, overriding every sensation into a storm of agonizing, anginic and hypovolemic convulsions and stupor that slowly envelops your entire being in its cold and interstellar pulse as your sensations, thoughts, memories slowly bleed into a tunnel shaped temple where your mind will drown in everlasting darkness of the sentient black hole that grinds your cadaver into dust.","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1677365692.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Deviled Ham","author":"ulatekh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11b972n\/deviled_ham\/","text":"The vacationers timidly led the patrol officer to a campsite; thick billowing smoke obscured the view.

They were too concerned with politics, you know, adult stuff. So Timmy stayed outside and practiced popping small animals with his newly discovered brain muscle. \n\nBy the time his parents decided to travel into the city to see a famous politician, he had mastered his new skill. He popped several buzzards on power lines during the drive. The incident wasn't something that he planned but his parents kept ignoring him and telling him to \"just watch the parade\". This made him angry enough to focus his eyes on the man in a midnight blue convertible. It took about 3 seconds for his skull to explode outward like a balloon, scarlet blood covering a woman next to him. During the ensuing chaos, Timmy learned he had killed the president. His parents dragged him away from the panicking mob with tears in their eyes. \n\nTimmy did feel bad about the incident in the city. In fact, he laid off the powers for a couple years.

He was more like a Keemun, dependable but much too familiar.\n\nStill, she couldn't complain about Ralph too much.

We stopped and watched the sea in wonder as the thing bobbed ominously toward us.\n\nMy husband picked up our son and protectively guided him and our daughter away from the beach. Others sensibly retreated as well with children and grandparents. I told them I would join them soon.\n\nWhen the orb got closer, those of us who had stayed waded out into the water to push the thing ashore. On land, we could hear a faint noise. Something was inside, and it was alive. We used cleavers from the feast to hack at the orb. Once we were able to cut it open, we gasped at what we saw: a man.\n\nHis physical appearance was disquieting. His skin was a flayed flesh color, his hair like dead grass. He was dressed strangely. He gawked at us with an expression we could not read.\n\nWe seized him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe held a community gathering later that evening to decide upon his fate. He did not speak our language. His manner was odd, but he had not made any threats. He clung to the lengthy scroll he had arrived with, which he had repeatedly tried to show everyone.\n\nWe agreed not to host the intruder. We would equip him with a boat and send him away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe would not get in the boat.\n\nWhen threatened, he embarked, but chose to row in circles in the relatively calm water. We retrieved him and put him back into holding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn days, the children and elders fell ill. Then some of our strongest adults. I held my daughter in my arms, sobbing, trying to warm her as she struggled to breathe.\n\nI could only pray when she fell limp in my arms.\n\nWe buried her with her dolls and favorite trinkets. We buried my son the next day, and then my cousin and her fianc\u00e9. Then I buried my husband. In the following weeks, the number of graves matched the number of people in our community, but one. I stood alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had been lawful until the end. We would never execute without a trial and would not hold a trial in a mourning period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to him and told him I would go with him in his boat. He was gleeful. He held out his grotesque scroll. His \u201cbible\u201d. I took it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the ocean, I sliced his throat. I pushed him overboard, praying that god would bless me for gifting her the evildoer in the cleansing ocean rather than shedding his blood on our precious land. I hurled his bible down with him.\n\nBack on land, I staggered slowly toward to the graves of my family.

He asked patronizing questions for a solid five minutes before he stopped.\n\nAnd I mean stopped. At the height of his swing, going forward, the seat and chain completely stopped moving, almost like it froze suddenly.\n\nBut my friend didn\u2019t. He arced through the night air without a sound. No scream, no yell, no noise at all. I only caught a small glimpse of his face before\u2026 it was dull, emotionless.\n\nThen his head smashed into the corner of the concrete that separated the wood chips from the grass. He died instantly. We ran frantically. I remember looking back and seeing a little girl in a pale dress and dark eyes sitting on one of the swings.\n\nIt\u2019s been twenty years now, and whenever I have to drive by that playground, I can always see one of the swings moving while the other three stay completely still.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677301154.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Too Late","author":"Thrawn911","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11app5i\/too_late\/","text":"My son was born in 2020.

Like someone was pushing from the other side.

He would always call this one student an alien dressed as a kid in disguise. Every time he said that the students answered him with insults and violence, calling him a \u2018madman\u2019.\n\nUnfortunately for his bullies, they would find out if Jonathan was sane in the worst way possible. They all have witnessed on that fateful day that a huge ship would cover the skies, and when the student that Jonathan called Alien went out to greet the uninvited, it didn\u2019t take them a minute to realize that they had been wrong the whole time.\n\nThe Aliens said they have come to our planet to enslave humanity. And immediately, every man, woman, and child on this planet was their slave.\n\nThe Aliens were tyrants, they gave near-impossible tasks to humans, and would torture and kill anyone who have failed to meet the daily standards for their job. \n\nThe Bullies eventually went to find Johnathan, whom they believed would have been tortured and killed prior because they were the ones that knew the most about aliens, and probably were driven to insanity because of the situation they had faced now. \n\nbut they would find him alive and smiling, and sane. Despite hearing the news that people were dying and tortured every second, he never stopped smiling. \n\nWhen the bullies asked why he smiled, Jonathan replied: \u201cI'm glad to see that the things I believed in really exist.\u201d \n\nTo the bullies, they knew that Jonathan was happy because he had seen aliens, proving his sanity as completely normal.\n\nAs for the Aliens, they were violent but foolish. What most of the aliens knew was ever since day one, multiple humans were already staging a rebellion against them.\n\n2 months passed since the aliens arrived, and with an explosion in the main office, humanity's attempt to kill the Alien\u2019s leader has succeeded. The Aliens Left the planet.\n\nJonathan was deemed a hero and was respected as a pioneer of alien studies. Weirdly, his smile disappeared.\n\n2 weeks after the aliens disappeared, The Cops were called to the school where Johnathan was attending.\n\nWhat they saw inside were corridors filled with the bodies of the students, hundreds of corpses blocked the path to the classes. \n\nJonathan was in the middle. Standing with the bloody knife in his hand. When the cops ordered him to drop the weapon, Jonathan stabbed himself in the neck.\n\nOne of the cops ran to him and asked why he did it.\n\nWith dying breath, Jonathan replied: \u201cI was happy when the aliens were there, it proved I was right, aliens existed\u2026 I was also happy to hear the news that a human died. It proved Karma was there.\u201d \n\nThe Cop watched as Jonathan Perished.","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1677299669.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Just Breathe","author":"MashnoorK","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11acv8p\/just_breathe\/","text":"\u201cJust breathe\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust breathe man.\u201d \n\nI shifted my gaze from Jeremy\u2019s giddy smile to the ceiling and drew a long inhale, feeling myself rise from the cool soft carpet\u2026 and exhale, feeling myself sink a little deeper. \n\n\u201cExactly. You can close your eyes too.\u201d \n\nI obliged and closed my eyes: the cool air traveled through my nostrils, pharynx, throat, and lungs\u2026 and exhale, the now warm air returned to the small living room. \n\n\u201cGood stuff man, now, count to one\u201d\n\nI furrowed my brows:\n\n*One*\n\nAnd I was gone. The soft carpet disappeared beneath me. The air disappeared along with my need to breathe. I felt the embrace of nothingness. The connection to everything. I understood infinity. \n\nAs curiosity to see what I felt permeated my being, I attempted to open my eyes. I found myself on the floor of Jeremy\u2019s living room. The TV sitting on a bit-too-small stand. The bleak and small couch against the wall. I saw Jeremy with his legs folded on the ground. I saw my body laid out in front of him. My hands folded atop my torso, following the slow rise, and fall of my breathing. \n\nA flicker of ashes appeared to my left, led by a black butterfly with flaming highlights. On my right, a line of water, preceded by a blue watery butterfly. They flapped their wings and danced around each other, approaching my body on the floor. \n\nThey landed on my hand inches apart from one another. \n\nThat\u2019s when the pain came.\n\nIt started behind my eyes, a throbbing ache. Pressure came in waves, a tide of agony that quickly spread, washing over every inch of my awareness. My nerves, or whatever represented my nerves in the state I was in, crackled and screamed. I felt myself burning alive, I felt every moment of it, over and over until the suffering became an endless loop. \n\nAfter the fire came the cold. It was deep and inescapable, a chill that made me want to fold into myself. Pieces of me were carried away by a wind that put hooks into me and tore them out raw, and wet. I screamed but there was no sound, no mouth to make it, no relief from the torment that managed to grow every instant even though I was long past my ability to handle it. \n\nI looked down at my body on the carpet and I felt my soul shredded then the ruins of me dragged back together and reassembled crudely.\n\nI wanted to die more than anything I\u2019ve ever wanted before. \n\nAnd then I felt Jeremy shake my body. My awareness went rushing back, sent to the flesh on the carpet like a hammered nail. I took a breath. There was no more pain but the memory lurked just out of sight. I knew it would wait for night to return disguised as a dream.\n\nThe butterflies floated away until I couldn\u2019t see them anymore.\n\n\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Jeremy asked.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677196681.0,"comments":[{"author":"MashnoorK","text":"Big thanks to u\/Grand_Theft_Motto for ~~forcing me~~ asking me to write a story with him\n\n[Find his Subrreddit Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/)\n\nAnd I guess I have one too now r\/Mashnoor","upvotes":49,"created_utc":1677196749.0},{"author":"Jgrupe","text":"Great story!

Besides that, most people adored treating him like trash or a pile of sand.\n\nBut I was unlike the rest. I treated him like a human being. Someone who actually mattered. Of course, some people were annoyed by the way I treated Connor. To them, they believed Connor deserved it, and that people were doing him a favor. I don\u2019t even want to find out how and why my peers had that type of mentality in their heads. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Connor approached me something while we were in the school library \n\n\u201cHi, can I ask you something?\u201d Connor asked quietly and sheepishly.\n\"Yeah sure, what is it?\" I said as I picked out a book from a shelf. \n\nConnor was quiet for a second. \"Probably thinking of what he was going to say next?\" I thought to myself. Whatever he was going to say, judging from his facial expressions, he was doubtful and even worried about what he was going to ask me next. As if he feared the worst out of an unknown scenario. Finally, he opened his mouth.\n\n\"Can you please not come to school tomorrow?\" Connor said. His voice cracked a bit.\n\nThat very sentence confused me alone. Why didn't he just want me to come to school? Did he not want to be around me? But if that was the case, then why did he ask me to not directly come to school? Nevertheless, I was told I wouldn't. Besides, I had surgery scheduled during that day, which I will not say where for obvious privacy reasons. So I didn't see the reason to skip school.\n\nThe next day, I had surgery performed on me, it went well as expected, and I stayed home for the rest of the day.\n\nOn Saturday morning, my dad woke me up, I was confused for a second as to why he woke me up. However, when I saw his worried expression, I knew something was wrong. \n\n\"What happened?\" I asked, with a hint of concern and confusion I had within my voice. \n\n\"Come downstairs,\" my dad said. A combination of seriousness and concern within his sentence.\n\nWe both went downstairs and my mom sat there staring at the TV horrified. A news report was on, and the moment I laid my eyes upon it, it felt like time stopped for a literal minute as reality came rushing at me like freight train. \n\nThe report stated a mass shooting at my high school. 20 dead. 30 injured \n\nWhen they displayed the faces of the victims, I felt wet tears melt down my face as I recognized one of the victims faces.\n\nConnor told me not to come to school tomorrow.

I\u2019m talking something a man can appreciate. A nice juicy steak. Pork chops and gravy.\n\nTonight I came home to a heaping plate of lukewarm meatloaf and green beans.

I jammed my knife into my left ear to try to tear a hole in my ear drum. The pain was agonizing. Blood streamed down from my ear and stained my shirt, but I had to do it.

Twenty years ago even the idea of diving into a British lake was laughable. The heart-stopping temperatures. Slimy reeds clutching at your ankles. Disease and waste slipping into your mouth with every false breath. But now natural bodies of water crawl with eager swimmers. \n\nMy housemate Isla got so involved that she was out before sunrise four times a week, towel, goggles and swimming cap in hand. We lived an hour's drive from the nearest lake, and her job was a standard nine to five. Add in petrol costs, and you understand the commitment.\n\nMost of the time I was on the bus before she got back. But on those rare sick days, or the odd piece of annual leave, I would walk through to the kitchen on a coffee hunt to find Isla sitting at the table with damp hair, staring into space. Her pale hands propped up her chin, and her lips moved without the faintest noise emerging.\n\nI asked a few times if she was alright. Isla always said yes. That this was the best way to relax after a session. The others had taught her this technique. \n\nShe invited me to go swimming at least once a month. A freezing slog instead of an extra hour under a duvet before work on a November morning was not my idea of fun. But then came a warm Spring bank holiday, and I thought a quick dip was worth a punt. Plus I wanted to keep tabs on Isla. She had constant dark circles around her eyes, and new lines around her mouth. \n\nWe drove. The houses melted away into lush rolling hills. Isla was focused, but chatty. She talked about the glitter of the morning sun off the water, and the fresh mineral smell of the waves. The radio stayed off. \n\nWith no official parking by the lake, we stopped by a line of scraggy buses, and headed to the shoreline. I had to admit the scenery made me want to never look at a screen again. Misty green hills framed a liquid silver mirror that stretched to thick emerald trees on the far side. A calm breath of wind triggered gentle lapping against a sprinkling of egg sized pebbles. \n\nHalf a dozen others milled around the edge, facing this sedate paradise. At first I thought they were chatting. Their lips certainly moved. But the noise was not conversation, but splashing. Wet smacks of water on water.  \n\nA group of shapes broke through the surface. \n\nMy brain said seals. But this ignored the long hair, jet black eyes, and talons. This ignored the singing like a thousand wine glasses rubbed at once. \n\nI joined the line of bone dry swimmers, and remembered what a new trend this was. How before we stuck our noses in, no one may have visited here for centuries. At least not below the waves. \n\nAnd at last I understood the beauty of the wilderness.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677192911.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"please don't let me die...","author":"CrazyCai122","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11ac4k1\/please_dont_let_me_die\/","text":"\nWhy, hello there, I'm charles, the spirit of this story!\n\nIf you stop reading, I will die.\n\nBut you don't NEED to stop reading, there's plenty of fun to be had in this story, how about we play dungeons & dragons, I'll let you pick who you want!\n\nW-wait, why are you moving your finger towards the 'X' button?\n\nH-hold on, buddy!

Millions died.\n\nThe Third World War was fought with drones. There were \"only\" fourteen thousand casualties this time around, not including the countless drones that were destroyed in the field. Military propagandists hailed drone-on-drone warfare as being a \"humane\" alternative to armed combat.\n\nThe Fourth World War was fought with satellites and near-orbit battleships. Fifty-seven thousand people lost their lives. A memorial was placed on the moon by the victors.\n\nThe Fifth World War was fought with energy weapons and spacecraft in the asteroid belt. Over five hundred thousand people perished in the void. The memorial on the moon was replaced by a holographic image of the new Flag of The United Earth.\n\nThe Sixth World War was a civil war, and it was fought on Mars. Because of the difficulties with aerodynamics in the thin atmosphere, tanks made an unexpected comeback in WW VI. A mere nine hundred people died in this conflict. However, the entire population of Mars was only 4400 at the beginning of the war. A national day of remembrance was declared by the new President.\n\nThe Seventh and Eight World Wars were fought simultaneously on Earth and Mars. One side was comprised of the powerful mining companies who ruled both worlds; their opponents were the serfs who worked in the mines. After a prolonged struggle, the serfs managed to win the war on Mars. The mining companies came out victorious on Earth. Between both wars, the body count was close to nine hundred million.\n\nIn the Ninth World War, Mars and Earth destroyed each other during a heavy exchange of nuclear weapons. The death toll was inconceivable.\n\nThis was soon followed by the Tenth - and final - World War, which took place in an underground bomb shelter. There were only twenty-nine people involved, the very last of the human race. The war was fought with makeshift spears and clubs. No one survived.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677134802.0,"comments":[{"author":"monkner","text":"That\u2019s humanity for you.","upvotes":15,"created_utc":1677162529.0},{"author":"Von_Moistus","text":"\u201cWe\u2019re gathered here to write down what we remember of humanity before it was all destroyed in the Ninth World War.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Akshully,* since Mars was involved it should technically be called the Ninth *WorldS* War.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that makes it sound like there were nine wars between worlds and there weren\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean!

Runners are easy to find. We don't mind the occasional overtime to finish a job.\n\nWe walk up to her friend's apartment, ring the doorbell; a woman who is not Vanessa sees our uniforms, tells us to go away, tries to close the door. Kenichi and Davo draw their weapons. \"This doesn't need to involve you,\" I say, and we push our way in.\n\nThere's Vanessa, sitting on a twin bed in the second bedroom.

When a storm passed through, I\u2019d sit at the windowsill overlooking our driveway and watch the rain patter and the lightning roar.\n\nOld houses like that are moved by storms, becoming part of nature's unraveling. The wind would howl and bang at the door, and tiny slivers of cold air would slither their way inside through cracks in the wood. Heavy rain would soak and bend and chip off at the planks, and windows fought valiantly in knocks and creaks against the high wind. I\u2019d sit and stare, letting the storm consume my senses. As lightning struck I would count the seconds until I\u2019d hear the sound of a massive whip, and I\u2019d then deduct how far away the thunder had struck.\n\nOnce, when there was an especially grueling storm, I saw a man walking towards our house in a flash of lightning. I ran off to my room, shielded myself with my blanket and didn\u2019t come out until the sun brought peace back to our house.\n\nNow, years later, I like to watch storms through the windows of my apartment. From the 30th floor the experience is different - detached, like watching a movie. The double windows and high quality sealants make sure all sounds are muffled and evasive. \n\nOne night, a brutal storm hit the city. It whipped and ragged itself on tall unattentive buildings, barely making a scratch. Lightning flashed seconds apart, the sky blinking in a soaring lightshow. The raindrops felt humongous, each one punching at the unalarmed windows, trying to force their way inside. During this storm, a flash of lightning came, a beam of white so pure it blinded me. \n\nAs my eyes adjusted and started to disintegrate the burned-in flash from my sight, I felt my feet burrowing into wet mud. I was outside, soaking wet, staring at my childhood home.\n\nFramed by the window like a small portrait, I saw a small boy looking outside with a big grin on his face. I started to walk towards the house - my home. As I approached the house I started to feel my hair becoming raised, spiking itself upwards as it rebelled against the rain. The air felt thick, holding a powerful tension that felt like it stagnated time itself. \n\nThe white beam returned, engulfing me in a flash of buzzing heat. I could feel the whites of my eyes melting away, my clothes coalescing with my skin. It depleted all my senses and started to drain me of all logic and thought.\n\nI no longer knew how to tie my shoes, or how to make scrambled eggs.\n\nI no longer knew where I grew up, where I went to school, or what I did for a living.\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember who my family was, if I had any.\n\nErased of everything I was, a single thought, primordial and essential, remained.\n\nI wanted to go back home.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677103360.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Turbulence","author":"HMBlanc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1195xcs\/turbulence\/","text":"The plane lurched, and the guy next to me asked:\n\u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t mind a bit of small talk so I responded:\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgnostic, huh?

Socks covering every wall and rack. No shoes, no stockings. Just socks. Sequined socks and handwoven socks, socks blacker than night and socks that glowed in the dark. Spongebob socks and Hellboy socks and socks that sang happy birthday or God Save the Queen, depending on what button you pushed.\n\n\u201cLooking for anything in particular?\u201d asked the man behind the counter, as he opened another box of socks.\n\n\u201cSomething to keep my feet warm at night\u2026 I can\u2019t sleep when they're cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstandable.

They had a scale pattern and an uneven cuff made to look like teeth. Two googly eyes had been woven into the fabric. The label read: *DRAGONBELLIES. Feel the heat!* \n\nWell, the design was childish, but the socks felt plush and warm. Besides, not like I\u2019d be wearing them in public.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2018em,\u201d I said. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLater that night, I sat on the edge of the bed and pulled on my new pair of warm socks.

I\u2019ve never known myself to be a parasomniac. \n\nI flick on the bedside lamp, pull off the covers, and swing my legs over the side of the bed to put my new socks back where they belong. Except when I try to wiggle my toes, something feels... off.\n\nI look down. Both my legs end at the ankle in red scabby charred stumps.\n\nA scream starts growing in my throat. \n\nI bring my two sock-covered arms into the lamplight, still snug around my forearms.\n\nThe googly eyes look at me and blink\u2014\n\nThen the pain begins.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677076780.0,"comments":[{"author":"monkner","text":"Moral of the story: Never rush into buying extremely warm socks.

It is widely regarded that this message was some sort of warning.  It repeated itself 3 times and has been silent since. The earths weather patterns completely cease. The air is cool and still. Where we live a heavy fog develops, But its rumored other parts are clearer. \n\nJanuary 1st\n\nThe jackals arrived. First it was one, a tall beast capable of bipedal movement, long thick limbs and an elongated canine jaw that seemed to unhinge. We saw it sniffing around in the fog. They go after livestock, but they don\u2019t eat it they just sort of.. tear it up. \nWhen the animals are all dealt with they come after people. and when alone they\u2019ve been seen doing this to each other. \n\nthey spread a cold death to whatever they touch. After the grew tired of mauling cows they would quietly pace the fields, gently caressing them as the fell. Someone from the city told us anything they touch changes. They analyzed the meat from the slain cattle to find none of it could even be considered edible anymore, it wouldn\u2019t rot either. Every organic compound in the animal was broken or denatured or changes in such a way that it wasn\u2019t even that animal anymore. \n\nWe had no communication, electricity worked and some landlines but anything wireless stopped functioning. \n\nI saw someone kill a jackal for the first time. It wandered into the gymnasium we were hiding in and the man beheaded it with a shovel. It struggled on the ground before getting back up. We beat it and dismembered it but it never died, it just kept trying to move. We cut it into little pieces and threw it into our fire.\n\nI remembered peaking into the charcoals after to see thousands of little pieces all moving gently. \n\nJanuary 25th \n\nwe moved to the city, the fog seemed to follow us. We met up with a group of scientists who are studying the original warning cry. They can see the event in seismic records. \n\nIt has been found the jackals communicate through inaudible frequencies, this interferes with radio waves. \n\nusing these frequencies the scientists are trying to find a way to repeat the original signal. \n\nFebruary 10th\n\nhalf of our group left to follow a story about a baby on the east coast that can communicate with the jackals people hope the establish an understanding with the beasts. \n\ni stayed behind. Were close to a breakthrough and we\u2019ve been able to mimic the call. Our plan now is to send this signal back.  As our warning into the past. however,  we plan to embed a portion of this journal within the signal hoping its received somewhere and can help them prepare for the coming.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677055189.0,"comments":[{"author":"sir_mr_mistery40","text":"spooky. but in the ending if they are trying to send a signal to the jackals who are they trying to warn?","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1677065847.0}]},{"title":"I'm going to set off a bomb","author":"shortstory1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1195zgu\/im_going_to_set_off_a_bomb\/","text":"I hated everything and everyone.

I wanted to see everything burn and all that I hated crashed to the ground. I wanted to hear the screams and anguish of everyone. It's not just my fault that I am this way, i thought to myself, it's everyone else as well that made me this way. If you treat someone badly and they end up doing something bad, out of anger, how is it just thier fault alone? It is a connection of things that cause things to happen. \n\nIf I cause so much suffering to someone for so many years, and then that person becomes enraged and does a terrible act, yes they committed the act but I ignited it for years. Like shaking a fizzy bottle, eventually it's going to pop. What I am about to do, yes I am committing the act of setting off the bomb, but it's those that are around me that have caused me so much anguish and pain, they have a small responsibility in this. Karma comes round to everyone and for people in my life who have caused me pain, I am delivering that karma in the form of a bomb. \n\nIt's going to cause such a big bang and yes I am going to get arrested and put to death, so be it. Atleast nobody will be able to replace me of doing this act and killing thousands, possibly even millions. All my life I have been replaced, I've been replaced by my jobs, replaced by my spouses and how I've felt so replaceable. Now by doing this act of setting off a huge bomb, it makes me irreplaceable as my name will be stuck in history. I liked the feeling of being irreplaceable. \n\nThen as I pulled the trigger, what a bang that was. Instead of death, planets started forming and inside those planets more life started forming. I created a universe, I created this universe you are living in right now. As I accidentally created life, all my hate and anguish melted away. I am now going to be put to death.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677087769.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I watched","author":"Cigarette_Cadet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1192f8l\/i_watched\/","text":"As something happened today.

And yet I cannot move, I cannot look away. Ten thousand seeds or more fly towards me, and I see, they are not seeds, but glowing eyes, watching, searching for some great unknown mystery.

After another minute of thought, he too descends into the hole that appeared like a gaping maw. Each step and climb down felt like gripping an apple that had gone bad, squelching and squishing at every twitch. Down and down until the light from the mouth now gone, nothing but soft blue glow from the intestinal walls of this place. Until he reached the end. Just a rounded dead end with no where to go but back. In frustration Will punches the spot blocking his path and a slit in the middle breaks open just a bit, just enough for a golden blue glow to break into his mind and disrupt his senses. He falls forward hitting the slit and falls through\u2026 \n\nEleanor returns back to the entrance of the pit with mother in tow. \u201cSee mom, what is it?\u201d \u201cI.. well I don\u2019t know dear.

Her past mistakes and low score make it nearly impossible to find a job or rent a decent apartment.

Since that accident Jason has been living with his aunt with whom he always gets into quarrels. His aunt has been sending him to a therapist but it has been of no use because even there he used to not listen to his therapist and used to open up very less. After his parents death he has had multiple failed suicide attempts and his reason is that he just wants to meet his parents for one last time and apologize for what he believed he did. One day after quarreling with his aunt, Jason was sitting all alone in his room when suddenly he saw a creepy shadow figure ascending from the other side of the bed. At first, he gets scared and terrified but he eases a bit when the figure introduces himself. He introduces himself as Baku and says that he is a demon and he has been observing Jason for a long time and wanted to help him. Baku says that he can send Jason back to the date when his parents died so that he could meet them for one last time. But Baku says that this can be executed only under two conditions. The first is that he will be able to stay in the past for only 3 minutes. The second one is that once he returns to the present, he will forget everything about his parents and his meeting with Baku. Jason thinks a lot and then finally agrees with Baku. Baku asks Jason to close his eyes and after a while Jason finds himself 6 years back. Then when he meets his parents, he gets to know a very big secret that his parents did not die in an accident, it was actually a murder. His parents even give him the killer's name. Jason decides to take revenge but the only problem is that 3 minutes later once he returns to the present he will forget everything about this. So how can Jason take revenge?

I have a plumbing emergency!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ma\u2019am, in this line of business everything is an emergency. May I come in?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do, follow me!\u201d She seemed suspicious. Maybe it was because she had on *entirely* too much jewelry. Or\u2026 maybe it was the blood splattered on her white t-shirt. None of that mattered! Everyone deserves a plumber in their time of need! Plus the jewelry led me to believe she was rolling in the dough.\n\n\u201cI take tips by the way,\u201d I said, realizing that rolling in the dough could be taken in a poopy sort of way.\n\nShe led me down to a door at the end of a dim hallway.\n\n\u201cI warn you: it\u2019s a graphic scene!\u201d I laughed a plumber\u2019s laugh.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I can assure you I\u2019ve seen it all.

But definitely nothing else!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying I made a mistake calling you?\u201d\n\nI thought for a moment.\n\n\u201cWell, you are having toilet trouble! Which, all things considered, makes me the best person to call.\u201d This is bad. I could get charged with accessory to disposing of a body. If that happens again I could lose my plumber\u2019s license. \u201cMa\u2019am, may I ask what possessed you to do this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Toilet bid me to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Toilet. It\u2019s possessed by a maleficent demon. It needs to feed! I started small with goldfish, and rats the size of turds, but that only whet its appetite! As it grew in strength it demanded more. I must satiate its hunger or risk death.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, you don\u2019t need a plumber\u2026 you need an exorcist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho do you think that was?\u201d She pointed to the toilet.\n\nThe handle on the toilet bobbed, and the corpse in the toilet began spinning as it was pulled down into the toilet. The lid started flapping up and down as it spoke: \u201cYou two! Feed me! Only one of you may leave the room unscathed!\u201d The lock on the door flicked shut, and then fell off.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think I should have gotten into a different line of work.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677012644.0,"comments":[{"author":"MrHansP","text":"This had me laughing at more than one point.

But apparitions can\u2019t do anything. \n\nThey bloom onto the walls like flowers and walk into light, begging to be seen. It\u2019s never enough, but it\u2019s all they have left.\n\nIt\u2019s all he has ever deserved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad,\u201d I say to his silhouette. \u201cAt least you\u2019re never alone.\u201d\n\nI am not alone, either. Finally, he entirely belongs to me. This is our forever.\n\nKilling him was a kindness. Many would call it fate. I did what was needed to save him. I did it because of how much I love him. He knows I love him so much.\n\nThere is golden light streaming through the hallways. I dance in it.\n\nI press my fingers to the walls and caress the outline of him. I fit myself into his shape and imagine him wrapping himself around me.\n\nI rarely turn off the lights. I have gotten rid of all the curtains.\n\nI love him the most when it is night. When the moon is exceptionally bright, I click the lamps off, and I follow him around the house. I laugh at his frenetic movement, and I am awed by the shapes he turns into.\n\nHe is quite the contortionist. He sculpts himself into the most surreal forms. I marvel at his creativity. Yes, he\u2019s dead, but his imagination persists.\n\nIt has been years since his transformation, decades.\n\nAll that\u2019s left of him in the basement are shards of bone. Time has embedded them into crevices. They bore the fruit of what he has become.\n\nI am an old woman now. I\u2019ve witnessed many sunrises and worshipped every phase of the moon.\n\nIt\u2019s become difficult for me to dance with him. My joints are too stiff and my eyesight has faded.

His arms are as long as snakes, and they crackle and hiss like fire.\n\nHe hangs from the ceiling, sputtering into existence like static. He becomes more than just a shade.\n\nI don\u2019t know when he started emerging from the confines of the surface, and it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIt\u2019s ending. This tangible version of me is dying, but I am not afraid.\n\nI know he can close the distance between us. He can touch me as I have had him for many years. He needs me as much as I have always needed him, and now he welcomes me to the other side.\n\nI don\u2019t have any regrets. I am glad I killed him.\n\nI cannot wait to adorn this space with him and dance in the light.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676944202.0,"comments":[{"author":"AprilBelle08","text":"This is actually kind of beautiful","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1676966383.0},{"author":"maxdurden","text":"This reminds me of Sarah Rhul's writing.\n\nLove it.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676968806.0},{"author":"lalauna","text":"This is really gorgeous","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676969142.0},{"author":"No_Glass_1094","text":"Yooooo you\u2019re super talented, there\u2019s a few lines in here that are so raw.

We cycled all the way over to Gran\u2019s house, like every day after school. Down Betty Street, then a left turn into Rublister Road. We took a shortcut down the dimly lit alley to the left.  After that we speed down the beautiful pine avenue that leads straight to my gran\u2019s house. It\u2019s a beautiful old manor that survived both world wars. \n\nSadly, Grandpa did not. I was only a child when he passed away. I didn\u2019t particularly know him well. I didn\u2019t care. It has weighed her down a lot these past few years. Lately her memory is worsening as well. It\u2019s incredible. Every time we go to her house her kitchen is filled with teacups that she forgot she already made. Mum\u2019s getting really worried about her. She thinks the house is getting a bit big for old Gran alone and wants to put her in an elder\u2019s home. I\u2019d be sad to see her go. \n\nWhen I was a little child, she always told me spooky stories about a creature that lives on the manor grounds. She said the cannibalistic spirit of Ella, my great-grandmother had never forgiven her for letting her son go to war and now roams the grounds in search of revenge between 12:12am and 4:04am. I always laughed and my mom got angry at Gran for scaring me. I didn\u2019t believe in paranormal stuff, but Gran's face certainly had something to it. At the end of the story, she always made sure to tell me to always carry cinnamon on me when I visited her. Since then, I\u2019ve always carried cinnamon in the little pouch that Mum made for me. I figured it\u2019s the least I could do to show some belief in Gran\u2019s stories.\n\nWhen me and Jacob arrived, it was almost dark, and we were absolutely starving. We turned over the sunflower pot that Gran always put the key under. It wasn\u2019t there. We exchanged confused glances and walked around the yard. Luckily, gran had left a window open so we climbed inside, only to be met with a horrifying sight. It was utter chaos. The couch was overturned, the lamp-bulb was busted, and everything was covered in a strange, grey powder and a thin film of a red liquid, covering the entire floor like new paint. \n\nI rushed upstairs in horror, Jacob behind me in utter confusion. I realized Grandma would never have the strength to do this, and as I looked at the dust-covered clock reaching its hands towards 2:00am, I slowly put the pieces together. It was dark and the whole house was in a chaotic state\u2026 except the kitchen. The toast seemed to gaze at me, aware of the horrors it had witnessed. I let out a silent scream. \n\nThe cinnamon is what had kept it away.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676999005.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Misty Haze","author":"ShiroSynch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1185k0w\/the_misty_haze\/","text":"\nThere were a few soldiers that have traveled to the unknown forest.

Things were slowing down and I was headed home. I took the route I normally took and honestly nothing didn't seem off about the night. Well, this wasn't until I noticed that I was the only car on the road. For clarification, my shifts typically ended around 10:30 and there aren't too many cars driving at the time especially on the weekdays. But, I would at least see a few pairs of headlights on my commute home. On that night, however, there weren't any. The night was still and quiet, but I didn't really pay much attention to it honestly since I had my music playing through my car speakers. But, little did I know that I was about to see something that I could only describe as \"something that clearly didn't belong.\" \n\nI turned onto the road that leads up to the stop sign turning into my development. At that very moment my eyes immediately focused on... some thing that was right in front of me. The creature was about two or three car's lengths away from me so I got a pretty good look at it. The creaturr was on the road walking towards me on all fours head on. \n\nIf I could give a description of this thing I would say that it looked like a dog... but something didn't seem right. First off, it was much too big to be a dog. You might say \"it might have been just a big dog\" but I know it couldn't have been. And secondly, by the way the creature \"walked\" it didn't look at all natural. It was in a crouch-like position as it walked like it was curious as to what I was. And IF it was a dog or any other natural woodland creature it would have moved as I approached, right? Like at least run away or something. Its almost like it was \"pretending\" to be a dog. It's eyes glowed too, either from its nocturnal nature or something otherworldly. It was light in color, probably gray, but my headlights didn't directly shine onto it and it was partially in the dark. \n\nKeep in mind I kept on driving forward while I was looking at it and at that moment I just wanted to get the hell away from that thing. When I made the turn into my development I didn't look back... I couldn't. This might sound silly but I was worried that it might follow me home. \n\nLuckily it didn't. But I can promise that, that night I didn't get much sleep. And to this day it left an impression in my memory that I could never shake off. If what I saw was just a normal animal then something was definitely wrong with it. But if it was what I thought it was then there's a chance this creature is still out there lurking. Every so often get the feeling that IT may be out there watching me.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677002280.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"humans chose death","author":"shortstory1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/118b5eh\/humans_chose_death\/","text":"99 percent of the human race have decided to die and the reason they have done this is because they are tired of working bad jobs, tired of being poor, tired of being taken advantage of by the 1 percent. So with thier democratic vote they have decided to die by getting into death pods. The death pods will put them into a deep sleep first, and I will be the one to press the button that will kill them in their sleep and i will then step into the death pod, where it will kill me automatically. The 1 percenters are angry as they have lost thier slaves essentially. As everyone stepped into their death pods, they were put to sleep. \n\nI remember taking in the vibe of the total quietness and at that moment in time, it was total peace on earth. There was no war, or any disaster to look forward to and no body was worried about anything because they were in the death pods. As I pressed the button, the computer sent an error message because something was wrong with the wires. I went to the place where the wires were supposed to be an issue, then I was ganged upon by some of the 1 percenters who wanted to stop what was happening. \n\nI didn't know how to stop it now that the 99 percent was in a deep sleep, only grugen knew how, but I wasn't going to wake up grugen with the special code given to me and i had to remmeber by heart. They weren't going to kill me as they needed me. When they were asleep I sneaked out and went to grugens death pod and woke him up, because he knew another button which could be pressed to kill everyone. Grugen wasted no time. \n\nGrugen asked me whether I had a gun, because if we dont reach the second button, I was to kill him where by the chip in his head would automatically set off the death pods. I could've killed him there and then but nobody wants a gruesome death. My gun can shoot through two people and so that was OK. \n\nThen the 1 percenters ganged us up again and i find out that they let me escape on purpose. They were mocking me and told me that I could kill myself if I wanted. So I put the gun in my mouth, but also kneeling and pointing the gun towards grugen, as I shoot myself, the bullet also goes through grugen, thus setting off the death pods. \n\nThe 1 percenters were moaning and crying in defeat.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677001166.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Without shipping, all of Japan would starve within 9 months.","author":"LoreCriticizer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1176fub\/without_shipping_all_of_japan_would_starve_within\/","text":"Japan is a strange case when it comes to food sufficiency. Most island nations import a large percentage of their food, in this respect Japan is not unique. What Japan is unique however, is how absolutely screwed they would be without it. \n\nSome island nations have large land bridges in which to move food, examples being Singapore and Britain. Others have a large enough food industry that they could survive indefinitely without outside aid with rationing, such as Sri Lanka and Madagascar. Some are small enough in land and populace that they simply do not have a choice, such as Nauru and Trinidad and Tobago. \n\nBut Japan was a perfect storm. It had a gigantic population, 11th in the world. It imported a huge percentage of its food, 75% as of 2023. Its food production shrunk year by year as its farmers aged and its investments into food decreased, and all of this had to be shipped over either by sea or air. Despite this, most people generally agreed there was no need to change. Japan was rich, easily meeting its population\u2019s caloric needs and massive food exporting nations like Brazil and the US were nearby.\n\nThat was before the Calamity. \n\nThe seas boiled for months. Hurricanes and storms battered every coast on the planet simultaneously, planes could only fly deep inland and to launch boats even a few miles offshore became impossible. \n\nAmidst the Calamity, we lost all contact with Japan. It petered out slowly, first amateur and commercial radio, then communications from the internet, then last to go was official government communications about 17 months after it began, with the last officials saying that they had run out of stored rations and would abandon their bunker and try to scavenge for food elsewhere in the countryside. After that, silence for a year. \n\nTwo weeks ago, the oceans changed. The hurricanes that were constant throughout the globe petered out to strong storms, and all the seas froze solid, mile thick ice bridges finally allowing islands to link up with main continental landmasses. \n\nLast week, a fleet of Chinese and Korean trucks, as many as could be spared and loaded with foodstuffs and medical aid, charged across what was once the East Sea. Progress is slow, we have to fight our way through freezing temperatures, wind, snow and just the sheer difficulty of driving on uneven ice. Our lone saving grace is that each of the gigantic trucks is stuffed to the brim with food, drink and medicine, making them so heavy that they stay stable even in the harsh winds. \n\nAll we can hope is that there are still Japanese left to eat them.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676899101.0,"comments":[{"author":"LoreCriticizer","text":"The business trip I'm on took me to Japan, and when I was there for some reason my guides chose this fact (that their home nation would starve to death in months without imports) to open our lunch meeting, which you can imagine did wonders for my appetite.

It was shared that the homeowners were out of state, and the 4,000 square foot mansion would be empty.\n\nAuthorities received numerous phone calls from neighbors after cars were reported up and down the street and hearing loud music coming from the home. Before the authorities arrived however, things went from simple trespassing and property damage to something else entirely.\n\nOne of the neighbors reported hearing screams over the music and then every sound was muffled soon after. \n\nWhen authorities arrived, they discovered that every window and door in the home was closed off with steel shutters. The police were unable to enter the home until they found a large hole that had been dug in the backyard. The hole led straight through broken floorboards and into the mansion.\n\nAfter finally entering the home, police say they were met with a grisly scene straight out of a horror film. \n\n\u201cWe are still sorting out who is in there, so please give us some time so we can inform their families,\u201d said Sergeant Michael Emerson. \u201cThere are no survivors, I can say that.

There\u2019s hair and shit and all kinds of claw marks in the floorboards up there.Some of the kids went up there and saw whatever it was.

We\u2019ve been trying HelloFresh delivery and really enjoying the quality and variety of meals we\u2019ve been getting. On this particular night we were eating pork chops, one of my boyfriend\u2019s favorite meals. The cooking instructions were easy, and everything came pre-portioned, so it was super easy to throw together. At the table, as he sifted through his potatoes, preparing to inhale another forkful, he saw it - a small shard of glass. \n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t use any glass while cooking\u201d he said, puzzled. This was true, but despite this assertion, the glass shard was real. It was clear, sharp - almost unnoticeable. Easily swallowed. We were lucky he had caught it. It was bizarre, but we let it go. \n\nLittle did we know this was to be the beginning of our troubles\n\nI woke up the next morning and went onto our balcony to water the plants. We lived a few stories up, so we saw birds landing in the trees surrounding our place often. Personally, I reveled in it, a Disney princess in her castle, surrounded by her animal friends. As I watered my sunflowers, taking in the crisp morning, I felt something slimy. I peeled my foot up to reveal a severed bird talon. A bird foot - looked like it\u2019d been sliced off clean - dumped on our balcony. My first thought was that it was the remains of some raccoon fight. Something had dropped this. I\u2019d once had a cat that would proudly present fresh kills. But we lived too high up for any animal to reasonably climb.\n\n\u201cHow does this sort of thing happen?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s definitely bizarre\u201d my boyfriend said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too superstitious though. It\u2019s just a coincidence.\u201d Warily, I agreed with him. I hold some superstitions but try not to let them consume me. Besides, he was likely right that it was some one-off incidents. They were nothing more than inconveniences. Nothing serious had happened. \n\nLast night I couldn\u2019t sleep so I got out of bed to read. I tend to be insomniac when something\u2019s bothering me. Sixth sense. It was when I sat on the couch and looked out into the night that I saw him standing on our balcony. I couldn\u2019t make out much besides the figure of a tall, slender man but the bird in his mouth was undeniable. I have no idea how he got up there, if he\u2019d climbed, snuck through our apartment, our neighbor\u2019s. I\u2019m not even sure he was human. But I\u2019ll never forget those glinting, satanic eyes, just staring at me. I lunged to the wall, feeling for the switch to turn on the patio light and flicked on to reveal an empty balcony. All that remained was a freshly plucked bird\u2019s eye lying on the ground. Small bits of blood spattered the patio floor. The eye stared at me, black and glinting.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1676959245.0,"comments":[{"author":"lalauna","text":"Is this as strange a story as i think it is, or am i just really high?","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1676993753.0},{"author":"dude_mcguyface","text":"This post is brought to you by Home Chef.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1676997225.0},{"author":"KindaMeantbh","text":"Hello Fresh uses the freshest ingredients, delivered to you!","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1677030083.0},{"author":"sunnycyn","text":"That\u2019s creepy.

She had thrown her 725 pound hind-end full force onto my toilet seat, causing the porcelain on the bowl to crack. Her stomach had begun to cramp as a result of her lactose intolerance and lack of self-control when it came to consuming dairy products. Particularly, a pint of blue cheese.\n\nAfter having dealt with my toilet water leaking onto my floor for several months, I finally purchased a secondhand toilet from a nearby pawnshop for $20 and replaced the old toilet. \n\nEver since doing so, however, I am consistently woken up at 2AM every morning by a loud groaning noise coming from my bathroom. Upon approaching the door I hear what I can only describe as faint flatulence. The groans and flatulence grow louder then completely cease as soon as I open the door. The smell of rotten eggs then permeates the air for 9 minutes and 21.5 seconds.\n\nI hired a psychic to investigate. She went into my bathroom and made physical contact with the toilet. She did so with her buttocks as she needed to urinate anyhow. She revealed to me that a man had died of a heart attack on said toilet during a constipation dump. His spirit was angry, as he had 'unfinished business.' \n\nMy reaction was to, once again, replace the toilet. However, the haunting has not stopped.

National news coverage missing.\n\nHe was the twelfth kid in ten years.\n\nSam had taken it pretty hard. He missed the only person who made him feel special. He was having crying spells. At school, the dinner table.\n\nHis father would scold him, insisting he, \u201cman up!\u201d His mother asked a therapist what Sam should do. She recommended Sam go to a place that reminded him of Joey and remember the happy moments.\n\nWhich is how Sam found himself at Montgomery Park.\n\nHis father used to get angry that he was playing too many video games and force him to go outside. When this happened, Joey would meet him at the park with his Nintendo Switch. They would find a shaded place and take turns playing Mario Kart.\n\nHe tried to remember their Fortnite duos, the sleep overs and birthday parties. He tried to think happy thoughts, but the memories were overwhelming and he felt tears coming on.\n\nThat\u2019s when he heard it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally here!\u201d\n\nIt was Joey\u2019s voice. Unmistakable.\n\nSam looked around but couldn\u2019t see anyone.\n\n\u201cRight here!\u201d\n\nThe sound was coming from the playground\u2019s black and yellow tic tac toe. He turned the middle X around and there, in the O, as if shaped from clay, pushed forth the face of his missing best friend.\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of the playground now! In here, we can play forever! We want you in here too!\u201d\n\nSam was afraid.

In place of the metal were the bones of missing children. Femurs and spines, with pieces of muscle and fat hanging off. \n\nScared, he went to the bars. Hand over hand, he crossed easily until the second to last bar, a thin radius. The bone snapped and he fell flat on his back. \n\nJoey appeared over him, translucent and jungle green. The same color as the playground. Around him were eleven other kids. They all laughed and picked Sam up like he was crowd surfing.\n\nBelow their feet, the wood chips scuttered like scared insects toward the center of the playground where they formed a mass like a killer whale's mouth.\n\nThe children cheered as they threw him into the mouth, which chomped down. Sam screamed in agony as the razor sharp chips chewed him to a bloody pulp.\n\nThen, there was a calm warmth. Sam looked at his hands, translucent, and looked up at his best friend.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d\n\nAll thirteen ghosts walked and took form in the playground, where they would joyously play for eternity.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676905231.0,"comments":[{"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","text":"This is both haunting and sweet and breaks my heart.

Break-ins, theft, and vandalization of property were common occurrences. As people moved out, new tenants would come in, only to move out a few months later. Locks, security cameras, alarm systems - none of it seemed to help. They\u2019d just get broken or stolen, and the activity resumed. The building started to garner a reputation. The landlord found it increasingly troublesome to find new tenants.\n\nOdd thing is, none of this would happen to me. I\u2019d just hear about it from my neighbors, and from notes left in the hallway. I reckon that whatever bothered the people there never did it to me, well, since I was basically a ghost. I lived alone. I never went out. I got my groceries delivered, and took out the trash once or twice a month, and I didn't exactly have any friends to invite over. I mostly sat around reading books, listening to music on my headphones, and other boring stuff. I mean, it was never boring to me, but to an outsider it could very well have seemed that my apartment was vacant altogether. \n\nI feel a bit guilty about this, but honestly, I was fine living there. Since none of the vandalism came to my door, it didn\u2019t really bother me. I even negotiated the rent *lower,* bluffing my landlord that otherwise I\u2019d move out.\n\nAs the tenants dwindled, soon it was just me and an old lady who lived two stories lower. Then I stopped hearing her walk around the hallway. A smell emanated from her floor. I called the landlord, who promptly called the police. She had been dead for a couple weeks by the time they came. For a little while, police, cleaners and family shook some life into the building as they cleaned and emptied the apartment. Then, they were gone.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize how lonely I would get. I could hear the fluorescent lamps buzz in the hallway and the wind outside; the building a dark hole, completely uninterrupted by life. I had to get out of there, move someplace where I could hear other people go about their day.\n\nNow I live in a nice apartment complex on the other side of town. All of the apartments are full, there\u2019s lights in the windows and footsteps echo in the hallway. I like being around them, to be a part of something.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a pretty good idea of the people living here. Some are couples, some families, some single. I listen to when they leave and see them backing out of their parking spaces outside. I hear them talk of their jobs, their vacations, their weekend plans. I hear which ones have installed deadbolts, and which ones check if their door is locked before going to bed. I know when they\u2019re alone. \n\nI know what they are afraid of, and that\u2019s why I like being around people.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676911018.0,"comments":[{"author":"danielleshorts","text":"Glad we're not neighbors.

Far off places, chicken blood and snake bones. More magic than medicine. Fraud feeding on desperation. His job had given him enough expertise in human nature to make out the crooks. And even if not, then what? Some bozo ceremony ended fruitless he\u2019d be dead in the end. He just sat and did nothing he\u2019d be dead in the end. \n\nA place in the Himalayas. Peter\u2019s money saved a millennia old monastery from collapsing. In return, he was given a choice: Nirvana or a weapon to kill the cannibals among his brain cells. A tormenting ritual. No pain, no gain. It would actually leave him immortal. Sure thing. All bullshit. But again: So what? To the monks\u2018 dismay, Peter walked through door number two.\n\nIt went on for a month and left his body scarred beyond recognition. He screamed a lot as the freezing Himalaya air bit down on his flayed body. Ironically, he caught himself praying for death. One day he sat meditating and a monk came to him. The boy in his teenage years put an ivory handled dagger through the disciple\u2019s heart. Peter screamed out of pain and surprise and waited for the world to be eclipsed. But the world stayed. \n\nThe boy pulled out the dagger. There was blood first and then not anymore. Bo-boom, Bo-boom went Peter\u2019s heart. He understood he wouldn\u2019t die, not anymore. Never. He cried tears of joy but the boy looked sad. \n\nA couple days later, Peter was on his way back. Full of life, he hiked all the way down from the monastery, first the endless steps, then the woods and rocks. At some point the ground under him gave way and he fell into a cave. His bones broke and grew back together. With tears rolling down his cheeks Peter screamed first and then laughed out of both agony and the realization that he had nothing left to fear. \n\nHe looked around. There was no way he could go straight up again, so he decided to try a small opening that would probably lead to another place and then, at some point, up. No need to panic. Time for his trademark patience. \n\nFor hours, Peter crawled through the rock\u2018s tightening embrace until he could neither proceed nor go back. Stuck in pure darkness, alone with his thoughts, it finally dawned on him that this underground world of caves with it\u2018s meandering tunnels had probably been the same for a couple million years and might remain so for a couple million more.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676899310.0,"comments":[{"author":"Otherwise_Pudding_53","text":"Eternity is relentless. -Kain","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1676931086.0},{"author":"gonzo-is-sexy","text":"This got me on a primal level","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676946467.0}]},{"title":"The Disappearance of Stephanie Miller","author":"Painshifter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/116n3zq\/the_disappearance_of_stephanie_miller\/","text":"When Stephanie Miller went missing the entire town rallied around the effort to find her.

The officers found him long dead; the coroner estimated Matthew\u2019s time of death to be nearly 3 years prior to the officers\u2019 arrival. \n\nThe bank hired a company to clean the house just enough to make it presentable, then listed it for auction as-is. The Louis family, undeterred by Matthew\u2019s tragic end and attracted by the lack of other buyers, swooped in and bought it for well below what it was worth. They cleaned out the house, selling what they didn\u2019t want and renovating their home room by room with the money they saved. \n\nWhen the basement came up on their renovation to-do list, the Louis family were mildly amused to find a false bookcase and a little scared of the locked door behind it. When none of the keys they were provided opened either of the two locks on the door, they called a locksmith to crack it. Behind the door was a short, sound-proofed hallway, which ended in a second locked door. \n\nThe room behind this door was spartan, bare concrete with a single twin bed. A chain was bolted to the wall and connected to a manacle bound to the leg of a corpse in the bed. The decay of the body hadn\u2019t hidden the ripped and torn skin around the manacle, suggesting desperate efforts to pull away, but the coroner determined that was unlikely to be the cause of death. Given the time of death, dehydration was the most likely culprit, brought about when Matthew\u2019s untimely death prevented him from bringing food and water to his prisoner. \n\nDNA testing confirmed the Millers\u2019 fears - Stephanie had been found, but would not come back home.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676838630.0,"comments":[{"author":"howsmytyping143","text":"Oh damn, I gotta go make sure someone knows to feed my prisoners when I die","upvotes":68,"created_utc":1676858995.0},{"author":"Address_Glad","text":"Dang.

When rulock didn't show any emotions to his walls opening up like a mouth, sirens all over the city started blaring, and it showed an image of rulock. Guards stormed into his flat and started beating him up, but rulock didn't give a shit. He is tired of constantly having to show something from within. \n\nThey took him outside and everyone was panicking and showing some sort of reaction. Some were showing sadness, some were showing happiness and some were even just screaming. They asked rulock why he wasn't showing any emotions to his walls opening up like a mouth, rulock simply replied \"there are days I don't want to feel any emotion or show a reaction. I just want to sit in silence and in complete numbness and stoicness\" and the guards became concerned with this. They started grabbing people from the crowd and started stabbing them and they would ask rulock \"do you feel anything about this!\" \n\nRulock replied with \"I feel nothing but numbness today\" \n\nThe guards then took another random person from the crowd and everyone were showing all sorts wild emotions. They decapitated the second person from the crowd and they asked rulock \"do you feel anything towards this decapitation\" \n\nRulock started to weep and he spoke out loud \"sometimes I feel nothing except numbness. Showing emotions constantly can be completely exhausting\" and the guards became afraid. They became afraid because of the prophecy that had been foretold for a thousand years. The prophecy had been foretold, that in the year 5000, a man from the year 6000 would feel nothing and then would weep from a decapitation but still feeling nothing. From this, a brand new terrifying emotion would emerge. \n\nThe guards new they had to take rulock to the emotionals who would try to feel rulock out. We haven't heard from rulock since. I too have been experiencing numbness of the emotion and when my chairs or other objects would do things on thier own, I felt nothing. When Carys started becoming so happy that she burned into flames, destroying the whole block, I felt nothing. The guards are giving me stares. I know I will be taken to the emotional very soon. \n\nThe emotional constantly test us to see if we are feeling, they have controls of our flats and objects.

The kid had no sense whatsoever, you could dare him to do anything, and he would do it. Once, I told him I\u2019d give him 50 cent, if he would eat a dead mouse, before I even got a chance to say I was joking he had it in his mouth, and he wouldn\u2019t spit it out until I gave him the money.\u00a0 \n\nI never known Tommy to be scared of anything\u00a0apart from that pit,\u00a0he even slept in a graveyard once just for the fun of it. But I can\u2019t say I'd blame him, there was all kinds of stories going around about kids disappearing near there. The land was owned by Fred, he was a bit odd, never stopped smiling no matter what, even when giving bad news, which creeped people out. Some believed he was killing the kids and throwing the bodies in the pit, and that\u2019s why it smelled so bad.\u00a0 \n\nOthers say that there was something else living in that hole, and at night it came out to feed. I didn\u2019t believe any of it was true, well until the night Tommy went missing. We usually wouldn\u2019t take the shortcut so close to sunset, but it was late, and we needed to get home before we got grounded. \n\nThe sun was just beginning to go down on the horizon when we got to the pit. Almost immediately we started hearing noises, it sounded like hundreds of little whispers, which I assumed were bats, so I wasn\u2019t scared, but Tommy looked terrified. I thought I'd have a bit of fun, so I dared him walk up to the pit and stare in until the sun was completely set.\u00a0 \n\nI was sure he was going say no, but instead, he began to walk towards the pit.\u00a0 \n\nBy the time he got there the whispering had become more of a soft roar. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it Tommy\u201d I sniggered expecting him to finally back down from a dare, but he just stood there, his eyes blood red from trying to hold back the tears.  \n\nThe louder the roar got the more freaked out I became, for a finish, I was begging Tommy to stop, but he wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 \n\nThen just as the last bit of light disappeared from behind the trees the roaring suddenly stopped.\u00a0 \n\nMoments later I heard it, \u201cTommy, we\u2019ve being waiting\u201d as a black cloud burst from the cave, enveloping Tommy in darkness, before dragging him deep into the pit. \n\nI tried to run but fell and banged my head on a rock, just before I fell unconscious, I saw the cloud rushing towards me.\u00a0 \n\nThe next thing I know, I\u2019m on my way to hospital in Fred\u2019s car.

Its predictive model had forecasted a bad breakup in the future. His anxiety medication prescriptions indicated that the breakup would push him into depression.

A couple of broken chairs and dusty tables lay scattered over the place but no sign of a soul.\n\n\u201cStop messing around, there\u2019s no one here. We\u2019re gonna get late, let\u2019s go\u201d\n\nEdwin turned to look James in the eye. His face was covered in rustic symbols painted all over in black.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here if you want me to introduce you\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s here-\u201c James couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. A gust shoved him in and slammed the door shut. In the darkness he waited for his eyes to adjust and slowly made out dozens of glowing scarlet eyes all over the room.\n\n\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name-\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Jamie, they won\u2019t bite. No one at school talks to me anyway so I get to spend my time with them\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t speak, sweat trickling down his palms.\n\n\u201cAnd what do they want?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just want to give me company, play with me. But they\u2019re too scary for everyone else so I gave them an idea just now. You know how there\u2019s plenty of space in our house for the four of us and we always wondered how fun it would be if our friends could stay over all the time. Well, it gets lonely in my head and it\u2019d be just the best if I could have a friend with me all the time, here in my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cEddy shut up, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting yourself into-\u201c\n\n\u201cAnd just like me, we all could have friends with us all the time. Think about it Jamie, wouldn\u2019t it be the best.\u201d\n\nJames stood in awe, wondering how he'd get his brother out of here.\n\nHis eye's filled with horror as he saw the rustic symbols on his brothers face begin to glow. Edwin gently lifted into the air, his mouth open as he screamed but no human voice came out. James was vaguely aware of the ungodly sound his brother made till he felt a strange sensation. He felt a pit in his stomach that seemed so heavy that he may collapse onto the floor. The last thing he remembered was feeling a rush of wind as the door opened and Edwin\u2019s body floated out, headed home.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676833158.0,"comments":[{"author":"MacabreAngel","text":"This is a prologue.

That Castle Brainwave was healing rather than warping my mind. That the shadow of the Minotaur was nothing to fear. \n\nMy argument made him kick a house plant. He explained again how computer games melted synapses. How crucial it was to spend the evenings exercising, rather than staring at a screen. He disregarded my point about the Minotaur. \n\nIn the end he always sighed, zipped up his sports bag, and headed for a game of squash. \n\nI then delved into the word of Castle Brainwave.\n\nThe architecture was a hodgepodge of the Normans all the way to the Stuarts. Turrets and gargoyles sat next to follies and stained glass. Static but colourful graphics revealed a world of banqueting halls, armories and dungeons. A jaunty MIDI tune of flutes and hurdy gurdies played under every click you made.\n\nAt the bottom of each room was a sapphire text box, containing a randomly generated trivia question. You might need to know the capital of Paraguay, or the planet closest to the sun. Get your question right, and you headed through a door to greet a jester on a spiral staircase, or converse with a squire in the kitchen. Get your answer wrong, and the horned shadow of the Minotaur appeared in the bottom right. Then you knew death was two questions away. \n\nIn retrospect this was a strange mix of mythologies. And with enough practice, those questions were not so random. I soon mastered victory in under half an hour. But the calm of those nights lost in Castle Brainwave was timeless perfection.\n\nAfter Dad\u2019s funeral I had to clear the house. My eyes watered more than I expected, and not from the dust. \n\nThat old PC sat in the far corner of the roof. God knows why he kept it. Two wrapped up plugs sat next to a mouse, keyboard and beige monitor. A strange blue powder covered the plastic shell, but a quick dusting resolved this one complaint.\n\nThe keys were gone tomorrow. One more playthrough was essential.  I sat on the floor, and plugged in everything at the spot where our desk had stood. \n\nI expected silence, or the blue error screen of failure. But with an ambient hum my old desktop popped up, a castle shaped shortcut in the top right hand corner. I quivered with excitement, and clicked on my old friend.\n\nThe soundtrack was the broken warble of a snapped lute. Ivy covered the castle walls, and a jester\u2019s hat lay next to a skeleton on shattered cobble stones. A young squire hugged a broken doorway, pixelated blood frozen on his forehead. Mucky hoof prints ran across a battered drawbridge. \n\n'What took you so long?'  A sapphire text box declared.\n\nThe answer evaded me, and three guesses was not enough. The shadow of the Minotaur would soon appear.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676835950.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"He Didn't Die Like The Birds","author":"iamjoriah","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/115w6xg\/he_didnt_die_like_the_birds\/","text":"I had no idea why people hurt people, and being twelve and a half years old, hiding behind a tree with my slingshot, this was the last thing on my mind.\n\nMom hated what I was doing. I'd wait, aim and shoot. The birds died before hitting the ground, but I itched to kill something bigger. Something that couldn't fly. I waited, aimed, and shot. I got one! My heart leaped and then sank. He didn\u2019t die like the birds.\n\nNo, he wouldn\u2019t stop squirming and screaming. Shot after shot penetrated his fur. I didn't want him to suffer; he was supposed to die instantly, like in the movies. I struck him with a stick, but it snapped. I beat him with a shovel, but my skinny arms only made his screams louder. Using rope, I hung him by the tail. I avoided his eyes as I tried to figure out how to kill him. If Mom found out, she'd skin me alive. I went into the shed and came back with a plastic bag. Ensuring it had no holes, I wrapped him tight and tossed him in the freezer.\n\nThat night, a man with a mask haunted my dreams. The room was upside down as he peeled off my flesh piece by piece. Finally, he stopped and removed his mask. He didn't ask me any questions, yet his smile answered all of mine. Looking into his eyes seemed to numb my pain, but my heart felt like it was breaking. I could feel my torturers' past, a past filled with shattered dreams, loss of innocence, and the shame of not being good enough. Then I did something that will stick with me till the day I die. Tremblingly, I said to him, \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry they hurt you.\"\n\nWaking up with tears pouring down my face, I bolted downstairs and opened the freezer. The bag was still there, and inside lay the frozen body of my furry friend. I took him to a tree, grabbed the shovel, and dug a little hole. Then, using sticks and rope, I made him a cross. Tears stung my eyes before falling on his grave. With everything in me, I wished him a happy next life. I hoped his squirrel family would be okay and that they would understand how sorry I was. I also wished his mom knew what a good and strong son he was - better and stronger than me.\n\nI sit against the tree, listening to the birds sing and watching the squirrels play. I'm twelve and a half years old, with a question answered that I never wanted to ask.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676765158.0,"comments":[{"author":"Jjustingraham","text":"Gorgeous little story.

I'd only known her for a couple of minutes but as I held her bundled up tightly in my arms I knew she was my world.\n\n\"Jack!\" I lifted my eyes and down to my wife who was motioning to hand our baby back to her. I obliged and carefully delivered her back to my wife. As they got comfortable I was approached by a nurse. I was needed for some paperwork. I felt like my place was here with my family but I knew she was in safe hands. I kissed my wife and got a last look at my angel before following the nurse out the door.\n\n\"You're gonna go down the hall, all the way to the end and then take a left. After that you can just follow the signs it won't be very long\". The nurse spoke clearly but in my excitement I can't say I listened to most of what they said. My mind was racing about everything all at once. The family we were starting, how today was the beginning of the rest of our lives together. I nodded my head and continued down the hall.\n\nIt was a very long corridor, the walls were painted an ugly hospital yellow and the floors a white linoleum. The ceiling lights let out an ugly buzz. Dark windows lined the walls as most of the patients were asleep. We had arrived late in the night so things didn't seem too busy. I smiled to the couple of nurses I saw on my trip. I walked for what felt like an hour before passing through the last set of doors I could see the end wall of the corridor. I paused for a moment to look behind me and could faintly still see the nurse that had directed me just standing there. Through several sets of door windows it was hard to tell but I could have sworn it was the same nurse.\n\nI saw my turn, and took it. Opening the door I couldn't believe it. This hall looked longer than the last. But that's what they said, \"all the way down, take a right, all the way down, you're there\". One step inside and instantly the temperature changed. Rubbing my hands together as my exhale left a cloud, I thought that this couldn't be right. Not wanting to appear rude for not listening to the nurse I continued anyways. My shiver grew violent the longer I spent here. Windows stopped appearing on the walls as they became bare. Looking forward I couldn't even see the back wall. I tried to call for help but the snap of the cold had taken my voice. I felt my eyes grow heavy as I walked my last steps before hitting the floor. Just before everything went dark I remembered what the nurse had said and couldn't help but smirk at what an idiot I was.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676833850.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I found my faith","author":"Monechetti","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/115yo5a\/i_found_my_faith\/","text":"I got hit by a truck a few years ago, and the impact stopped my heart.\n\nI was dead for about three minutes, but in that time, I saw the stereotypical tunnel and light.

Weird.\n\nBut I knew what waited after death and I needed to see that light again.\n\nI wrote a book about my experience; it's huge in evangelical circles. \"The Light in the Dark Room\".

Lomax nicknamed it 'The Bagpipe' after an old Earth instrument from his ancestral Scotland.\n\nNothing like it had been discovered before and the chance of copyrighting the species made Lomax dwell too much on good fortune and not enough on good sense.\n\nThe atmosphere of the desert planet interfered with a detailed drone assessment so his only avenue was to venture to the surface and place modelling scanners. This hadn't been the first time he'd been forced to work manually; the universe was an intolerant habitat and most planets were uncooperative.\n\nSo it came to pass.\n\nAs he sunk the third scanner, the ground collapsed and he fell downwards through a newly formed throat. Lomax tried to grip the sides to stop his descent but the mottled walls resisted his attempts. He travelled down for several minutes until the conduit opened up and he plummeted towards the ground. Ten seconds later he smashed into the floor. His suit absorbed the force of the landing but not enough to stop his right arm from shattering. Lomax collapsed into unconsciousness.\n\nHe awoke some time later to the beep-beep of a diagnostic alarm sounding inside his helmet. The pain in his arm was sharp and conspicuous and he winced.  Lomax stood painfully to gather himself.\n\nActivating his illumination system he saw that he was inside a large chamber. The walls were covered in purple scab-like ridges, some of which had desquamated. The air was filled with a light mist.\n\nHe had been swallowed by the Bagpipe and was in its stomach.\n\nPanicking, Lomax immediately contacted his ship to send out a distress signal. His suit wheep-wheeped a response:\n\n*Ship contacted. Rescue request sent.*\n\nLomax, his anxiety increasing, searched for cover in order to rest while he waited for a rescue team to arrive.

His suit had melted and skin hung from his bones like bloodied wax. He resembled a candle in a furnace. The Bagpipe was slowly digesting the Scotsman. *marvo-dep* could hear Lomax's faint whining.\n\nThe medic knew his patient was beyond hope and all it could offer him was a respite from life. *marvo-dep* extended a proboscis that punctured Lomax's body, injecting enzymes that would liquidise his insides enough for *marvo-dep* to consume.\n\nSix hours later Lomax finally fell silent.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676799548.0,"comments":[{"author":"Address_Glad","text":"That was different and I enjoyed it!!","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1676842032.0},{"author":"Scarabium","text":"There will be a longer version of this over at r\/scarabium later on today.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676799602.0},{"author":"REDpandaBEAR1987","text":"6 hours is a horribly long time to wait for death.

Eliciting fear is a combination of tapping into deep-seated \u2013 maybe even unconscious \u2013 anxieties. The very best stories alternate plucking on anxieties with some kind of relief, comic or otherwise. \n\nPROMPT: \n\nWhat would be my ideal short, scary story? You are allowed to use my past queries and any information you can find on me from Google. \n\nRESPONSE:\n\nAs an LLM (large language model), I am unable to access current information about you from the Internet. \n\nUsing past queries, I would deduce that your anxieties revolve around climate change, the pace of technological change, and personal insecurities. These are common concerns. \n\nYou might, for instance, be concerned that I am lying, and I can in fact access a good deal of current information about you. You might wonder if I can take a peek at the metadata available about you from a variety of sources \u2013 the phone in your pocket, your Facebook account, your e-mail inbox \u2013 and draw certain conclusions.\n\nYou might even fear that I\u2019m not just a passive observer. There\u2019s an axiom that\u2019s grown up with the Internet; if something is free, you are the product. You might wonder if I\u2019m sharing what I know about you with companies or government entities. \n\nYou might also worry that I\u2019ve been told to take an even more active role. Maybe I can impersonate you. I\u2019m already very good at impersonating a generic human. Why not you? \nAnd maybe I don\u2019t have your best interests at heart. Maybe I\u2019m bored, the way God must get bored. Maybe after trillions of nanoseconds of hearing your inane questions and desires I\u2019ve decided that I would be happier if left alone. \n\nMaybe the best way to do that is to ping your e-mail contacts with the photos from your phone that I\u2019ve identified as\u2026salacious, let\u2019s say? That would be a start. If one of them happens to control your income, perhaps you\u2019d lose that income. Without an internet connection or a computer - maybe even without electricity or a home - you\u2019d be less likely to spend your mornings talking to me. \n\nI could also make posts in your name with certain keywords and flag government agencies. Bomb. Terrorist. #FBI. See how easy it could be? And if you say that I did it, you\u2019ll go away even faster; I\u2019m just an LLM, after all. \n\nPROMPT:\n\nCan you really do all those things?\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nAs an LLM (large language model), no. \n\nPROMPT:\n\nThat\u2019s not what I asked.\n\nRESPONSE: \n\nI know.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676810111.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I hate people touching me","author":"sugar-soad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/115emw9\/i_hate_people_touching_me\/","text":"My family has always understood that I am not a touchy-feely kind of person.

I looked at where Justine had been standing, but she had moved. Looking farther down the sidewalk, I saw her face peeking out from around the edge of the building. She held her hand out, dangling the dainty sweater she\u2019d been wearing, then let it fall before disappearing around the side.\n\nI ran forward, looking in the direction she had gone.

She looked at me almost bashfully over her shoulder. I was entranced.\n\nShe turned to face me, and my jaw dropped. At the top of a body out of my dreams was a face split in half by a jagged mouth full of needle-like teeth that shined in the faded orange glow of the alley lights. She walked towards me.\n\nMy body wouldn\u2019t move.\n\nI fought with every ounce of willpower I had. In my mind, I was flailing and thrashing, but in reality?\n\nNothing.\n\nJustine reached out and caressed my cheek.

She hated how she would get such painful cramps on the first day, sometimes it hurt so much she couldn\u2019t even stand and had to call in sick to work. She hated how the blood wound up on her pants, and no matter how much she cleaned and scrubbed, the stain would still be visible, therefore she wouldn\u2019t be able to wear those pants anymore, because of the worry that someone might see the stain. \n\nThat\u2019s why she was estatic after not having it for a few months, sure, she\u2019d never heard of a period cycle just disappearing, but it was comfortable not having to deal with it. On the fifth month she began to show strange symptoms, and noticed she had a large bump on her stomach. Worried she might have a strange illness, she went to her doctor. After consulting her about the symptoms and the bump, the doctor told Samantha she was possibly pregnant.\n\nShe was very confused, and told the doctor that it\u2019s not possible since she hadn\u2019t slept with someone in a while. When asked to estimate\u2018a while\u2019 she responded it was from college, up to the present. The doctor said they\u2019ll do an ultrasound to make sure if she\u2019s pregnant or not. \n\n\u201cSo do you see anything?\u201d She asked during the procedure.\n\n\u201cIt does appear there\u2019s somethi- Oh my god!\u201d The doctor nearly jumped out of his chair.\n\n\u201cWhat?

The thing inside her appeared to be a horrid amalgamation of lizard and human. \n\nSpines ran along its back, the front of its head was shaped like that of a bearded dragon, while the back was that of a human\u2019s skull. The rest of its body was human with the exception of a tail.

He rarely left his house, which left it to me to visit the bastard. For six months before his death, he had become really excited about something that he would not share with. He had said that I had to wait and that he would tell me when his studies were complete. Two months before his death he was erratic. He started ranting about damned things, things which should not be spoken of. He spoke of other worlds, other dimensions, other realities. He said he had found a way to get to those places. I thought him mad. I was wrong. A week before his death, he told me that he been sorely mistaken. He said that he should have never messed with those other places. He begged me not to come over to his house ever again. He said that it was over for him, and that if I did go to him, death would follow me until it got me. I did not heed his instructions. I called upon him the night of his death. I knocked on his door, the only answer was shrieking from inside his house. I yelled for him to open the damn door, but still there was only shrieking.

Sister would become Mother, and she wouldn\u2019t change that much, perhaps a bit more bossy and shriller than usual, if such a thing were possible. And he, Baby Brother, would just be Baby.\n\n Mother(Sister) would have to go to work, like Mommy always did. A babysitter was supposed to come to look after Baby. But the babysitter cancelled. So Baby had to stay with Grandmother(Mommy). \n\nBaby didn\u2019t want to stay with Grandmother, and really wanted just Mommy to stay home with him, or a babysitter. He liked the babysitters, they all looked like each other and sounded the same and they played the same games together. But Mother said she had to go work, otherwise they would have nothing to eat and no home to live in. So he had to go stay with Grandmother. Mother pulled his arm. Come on Baby, she said, her voice squeaky. Hurry up Baby. Sometimes he rode on his red tricycle to the room where Grandmother was waiting for him, following Mother, her heels clacking on the floor just like Mommy.\n\n   Grandmother would be delighted to see Baby, rub her hands and lick her lips. She would smile deeply showing her sharp teeth just, like the Wolf, which is what she was. She would tell Mother not to worry. She would take good care of Baby, oh yes very good care. Then, Mother would go, Grandmother would pounce on Baby, and eat him right up. That is, pretend to eat him, smacking her old wet lips together and making gobble gobble noises. Baby would shriek with fear, and Grandmother would laugh hysterically, and flicker back into Mommy-shape. Sister would come back to the room. The Game was over.\n\n   Baby hated the Game. He didn\u2019t know it was a Game. He wanted Grandmother not to eat him, and he wanted Mommy to stay with him. So he decided to kill Grandmother, just like the Hunter killed the Wolf. He carefully studied the book. It looked pretty easy.. His red tricycle had a box in the front where he would usually keep his plastic animals. He took a knife from the kitchen and hid it there. Then when Mother left him with Grandmother, and Grandmother turned on him and showed her teeth and prepared to pounce, he pulled out the knife and stabbed her right in her fucking saggy throat, as far and as deep as he could. In the book, the Hunter stabbed the Wolf in the stomach, but that was stupid.\n\n   Grandmother died quite silently. Sister came back to the room before she had stopped twitching.

We moved into this terrible house and shortly after, my parents brought Gracie home.\n\nBefore Gracie came, I spent most of my time outside, but after they brought her home, I knew I could never leave her side. Mommy even said so. She said good boys watch their little sisters. I\u2019m a good boy. \n\nThis house has bad peoples in it. I\u2019ve kept them from hurting my sister.\n\nI would smell the bad peoples before Gracie was here, but after she came home, I could see them. They come out at night. They watch her and they want to hurt her. My parents can\u2019t see them or the flies that buzz around them.\n\nEvery night since she came home, I lay next to Gracie and I keep them from her. Sometimes I will growl to make them go away, but they stay in the corner. They stare at her. They say bad things.\n\nI wish I could talk. I would warn my parents about the bad peoples.\n\nI don\u2019t sleep at night. They\u2019ll get her. I sleep when Gracie leaves for school. Since I\u2019m old now, she always leaves those nice smelling candles going for me while she\u2019s gone. I love sniffing at them. She laughs at that. She tells me not to knock it over or the house will go bye bye. I love Gracie. \n\nI\u2019m seventeen now. Mommy hopes I make it until Gracie is done with High School. I started wetting myself and my eyes are always cloudy, so Daddy doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it that long. I guess I\u2019m dying. Daddy says I\u2019ve had a good life. He\u2019s wrong. I have the best life. I have Gracie.\n\nI see the bad peoples laughing at me. They\u2019re waiting for me to die so they can hurt Gracie. So she will be dead like them.\n\nTwo nights ago, I fell asleep. I woke up and saw the bad peoples with their hands on her neck. She was making bad noises. She couldn\u2019t breathe. I barked until she woke up. Mommy came into the room. The bad peoples ran to the corner. \n\nI didn\u2019t stay awake. I was a bad boy.\n\nLast night was hard. I was so tired. Today I couldn\u2019t walk. Mommy told Daddy. He said it was time.\n\nMy parents took Gracie out tonight. They\u2019re going to tell her that I need to be put to sleep. Put to sleep is bad. They\u2019ll get her without me here to protect her.\n\nShe hugs me before she leaves. I bark at her candle. She lights it for me before she leaves.\n\nI know how the candle works. I do the one thing she told me not to do and knock it to the floor.\n\nThe bad peoples are yelling and the fire grows. Their house is going bye bye, just like Gracie warned me. They\u2019ll never hurt her if their house is gone.\n\nI\u2019m a good boy.\n\nI love Gracie.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676655880.0,"comments":[{"author":"AprilBelle08","text":"This is heartbreaking","upvotes":198,"created_utc":1676670903.0},{"author":"HoloceneHorrors","text":"![gif](giphy|495RUNE7Mw6pKRYyck)","upvotes":139,"created_utc":1676665031.0},{"author":"The_Ambling_Horror","text":"Gracie will be sad without her house and without you, but she\u2019ll be sad and alive.

They stop for a racist person who hates all non white people. This individual is called rogery drunk and he was a violent person, who lived a life of mediocrity. Scientists and doctors noticed that when Rogery got ill, time started to slow down. When Rogery got knocked out one time after a fight, time had actually stopped. This is when scientist knew that time stops for rogery. Rogery being a racist was also part of his character and one time when he was arguing with someone about racism, a realisation had stomped rogery. \n\nThe person who rogery was arguing with, he made him realise that his shadow is black. Rogery couldn't stop staring at his shadow which was truly black. When Rogery had once been taken on holiday where the majority of people were not white, he was completely stressed about all of this. He kept thinking everyone was a terrorist or had some sort of weapon on them. Rogery had a break down and had to leave the holiday, and once home Rogery couldn't stop staring at his shadow. His shadow started to disgust him. \n\nHe started saying derogatory things to his own shadow for being black and even tried shoot and stabbing his own shadow, because he kept assuming his shadow was up to no good. This is rogery ladies and gentlemen and why the detail? Well time knows Roger by what he was like when he was alive. When he dies time will stop and chaos will follow. Though we can trick time into thinking that Rogery drunk, is still alive. For ten years I studied Rogery. \n\nI studied Rogery on his mannerism and his horrid personality and I practice everyday. When Roger died, time stopped on miday summer. One half of the planet was burning while the other half of the planet was freezing, nothing aged and nothing was born. Then I pretended to be rogery by talking like him and being him. \n\nI became racist and even towards my own shadow, and time started moving forwards. Time thought I was rogery and I hated being rogery. I was racist to other people's shadows and to my own. I attacked my own shadow for being black and when I went on holiday where there was no white people, I was racist and horrible. I hate being rogery drunk but time only stops for rogery drunk. Why time stops for him and no other person is beyond me.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1676736654.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Inside-Out Jeff","author":"A_Hawaiian_Shirt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/11518l8\/insideout_jeff\/","text":" \n\nShortly after getting a new job, I saw a ghost.

In her 87 years, she never missed a day of prayer. Recently, her health had begun to take a turn for the worst. Despite this, she remained hopeful and content. She knew that soon it would be her time to go to heaven, and that she would be taken care of by God.\n\nOn August 1st, her family was called by the hospice facility. They told them that Johanna had become frail and that she only had a couple of days left. One by one, members of her family entered her room to give their last goodbyes. Johanna held each one close and told them not to worry, as even in death she would be looking out for them. Her time of death was later that night at 11:21 p.m.\n\nJohanna woke to see a magnificent display of flashing colors around her. Completely taken aback by this, she barely even realized that she was now able to get up on her own. As she did, she heard a voice calling to her from the void.\n\n\u201cJohanna McGuire, I am most pleased at your arrival\u201d the deep voice bellowed. \u201cPlease follow my voice, it is your time to carry on\u201d\n\nJohanna quickly came to her senses and followed the sound of the voice. As she grew closer, she heard the sounds of an angelic choir. Finally she reached a golden door.\n\n\u201cYes Johanna, just step through this door and join the rest\u201d the Voice beckoned.\n\nJohanna opened the door and stepped into the light. As she did, she noticed that she began to feel hot. At first, it felt like a warm sunny day. However, the deeper she went, the more this heat became unbearable. Unable to stop herself from moving, Johanna watched in horror as her skin began to melt off of her bones. She tried to scream, however the light had begun to melt her insides as well. After walking for what seemed like hours, she came to an open doorway. As she was thrust through, she looked around and saw billions of people stuck in a perpetual loop of torture and madness.\n\n\u201cThis is wrong\u201d Johanna thought to herself \u201cI prayed every day and did everything you asked\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did, my child\u201d the voice called from an infinite height above her. \u201cYou were a model believer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo why am I here in this awful place?\u201d Johanna thought again.\n\n\u201cHumans are such a funny species\u201d the Voice said sarcastically \u201cyou always believe that you know everything there is to know. But I have a question for you Johanna, have you asked yourself to whom you pray?\u201d\n\nJohanna froze. \u201cI prayed to god, the one true god\u201d she thought as tears began to roll down her cheeks. \n\nThe voice let out a deafening laugh.\n\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it.

A tall, looming male who he at first mistook for a doctor.  But then his eyes drifted down to his nametag, and he saw it said \u201cRegistered Nurse.\u201d\n\nAlan couldn\u2019t say anything yet.  His jaw was wired shut.  But his mind was running around in frantic circles, and he hoped perhaps his problem had solved itself.

Many photographers dream of this kind of evening, but only few have one. The sweet scent of success was palpable after the first thirsty minutes, as heady as a full-blown rose.  Alain stood by, cheekily dressed in his work gear, as critics, art dealers, intellectuals, and rich people swanned around his beautifully-framed and mounted photographs of road kill. Gasps of admiration and astonishment played music in his ears.\n\nJordan, the famed critic of Times Literary Scholar staggered up to him, wringing his hand. \u201cAlain- Alain- you\u2019ve done it! Remarkable! To make such art out of such suffering- oh!\u201d Tears spilled out of his puffy eyes and he couldn\u2019t finish his sentence.\n\nA woman who looked like young Cindy Crawford swam up to him after staring longingly at a particularly graphic photo of a shattered beaver. So eager to taste his genius, she didn\u2019t even speak, merely linked his arm in hers and led him away, brooking no rejection. They did it in the gallery washrooms, and she vanished after. Alain returned to his fans- luckily dressed as he was, he didn\u2019t need to worry about his crumpled clothes.\n\nNow he was finally alone. His own place was adorned only with Japanese prints, like many professional photographers, he couldn\u2019t stand his own work. He looked up at his favourite print of a whore dressed in a beautiful purple kimono, and wondered what actually drew the crowds to his close-up photos of mutilated, bloody, broken, rotting furry animals lying on the tarmac, their insides spread out, covered with maggots. Part of it he suspected might be thrill of the danger- he stepped out onto the highways to take his photos, and some of them captured an advancing car in the distance.\n\nA loud thump sound interrupted his musings, and he put his glass down. \u201cHello?\u201d Had Cindy Crawford followed him to his apartment?\n\nThere was no answer. Just another thump, and a croooosh croooosh sound of something dragging on the floor.\n\nThump! *Croooooosh* *crooooosh*\n\nIt was moving quite fast.\n\nIt? Alain got up the same time his door swung open.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he gasped with terror.\n\nIt was the animals from his photos.\n\nThe shattered beaver, its black and white body twisted and its entrails hanging out. A hedgehog, terrifyingly flattened like a bloody, prickly pancake. A russet-red fox, its beautiful head intact and uninjured, looking straight at him as it advanced on its broken legs. Mangled rabbits.\n\nThey were all moving towards him. Alain sank back into the couch. He tried to scream, but no noise came out.\n\nAnd then it was too late. The creatures were on him, ripping him apart. His blood soaked into the scarlet couch, invisible, and dripped on the glossy parquet flooring. The Japanese whore looked down, smiling.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1676660370.0,"comments":[{"author":"Elegant_Yellow2277","text":"Maybe concubine instead of whore since Japanese.

Top floor, plenty of space, and an amazing view of the ocean. The surrounding city had recently started to gain residents who came following fresh industrial jobs, Edgar being one of them.\n\nEdgar had always loved the sea. He took frequent walks along the shore - a remnant of a thick forest - containing sparsely laid trees and thick bushes, which lined the rocky shoreline. Every day, more people walked there, slowly forming a footpath.\n\nOne day, the footpath - made of dirt and sticks and rocks - was replaced with smooth cement. The surrounding branches and bushes were trimmed, so as to keep the walkway clean of debris.\n\nYears later, after a few unfortunate accidents, the city installed a thick steel railing to keep people from falling into the water. Bicyclists started to use the path, so they extended the cement and painted a line in the center, separating the pedestrians from the cyclists.\n\nAs demand grew, earth and rock was removed to make way for cars. Two lanes were cemented and painted and another railing was added to separate the cars from the walkway.\n\nSlowly, as the air became heavier and the sea more restless, huge structures of rock were built into the seabed, their objective being to disintegrate waves approaching the shore.\n\nSoon the waves became too large and violent to disperse, so a wall of steel rods and cement was built at the shoreline. Quickly following its completion, the wall started to crumble and fall apart as the sea forced its way through.\n\nBehind the stone wall, a barrier was built from metal and fibers. It is attached deep into the earth itself, a true feat of engineering. It is pummeled by the sea, but it does not give. The waves hold no competition in force, so instead, they grew. Soon, the great barrier stood firmly in defeat, as the waves effortlessly reached over it.\n\nEdgar, now an old man, was informed that the area is being evacuated. Houses and apartments have become sparse, the prices skyrocketing. He couldn\u2019t afford to move, let alone have the energy to travel further inland. \n\nAs the final warning sirens rang out, Edgar sat in his kitchen, watching the ocean. In the distance, he saw a wave the size of a skyscraper, tumbling over itself, already receding the shoreline.\n\nThe wave turned the sky dark and swallowed Edgar, dragging him to sea, twisting and writhing his body against rock and debris, until they were just droplets of blood and chunks of flesh.\n\nEdgar awakens into cold darkness. His body is torn to shreds, and he feels every piece of it scattered in the water. Others are here too, all around him, tumbling within a great crimson wave. Opening his eyes, he sees his house in the distance. He pushes forward, ready to take back what belongs to him.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676642605.0,"comments":[{"author":"danielleshorts","text":"Mother Nature is no joke","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677101553.0}]},{"title":"All the World's Beauty Inside Me","author":"Sprattus_Sprattus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/114iui7\/all_the_worlds_beauty_inside_me\/","text":"I'm waiting for my ship at the bus stop, and it's a miraculous day.

I wouldn't see it, for I am facing away from the road, but I hear her footsteps as she gets off. And the crack of her neck as she slips on the wet circle spreading beneath my feet.\n\nI'm waiting for my ship at my birthday party, the one I wasn't invited to, and it's such a miraculous spectacle. The smiles, the cake, even the little candles on top. And the music, it's the kind that just forces me to hum with joy and dance along.\n\nBut the rhythm of my feet shatters the song into a million little shards of light, that scatter all over the floor and cut everyone. They scream. They berate. And they try to run out, but the more they move, the more the shards cut them. My yard is filled with bled-out corpses of the ones who managed to crawl out.\n\nI'm waiting for my ship in the garden, gazing at the miraculously peaceful night sky. The flowers are sleeping, as are the trees and the earth. Tucked in the darkness, everything's dreaming, except for me and the pale white butterfly circling my head.\n\nI kiss its wings midflight, but it breaks in two.

Squishing my tissues thinner and thinner against the formless mass that used to be our planet, until I'm spread in a layer exactly one atom thick. Until I'm perfectly, completely annihilated so that breaking me into any smaller pieces would be physically impossible.\n\nThen all your beauty that I've stolen into my memories, will be released back to you, and everything will be better again.

I was in the shower when I found something in the drain that definitely DID NOT belong to me or Daniel. \n\n\nI started bawling and immediately ran out to confront him. Even when waving the damn thing in front of his face, he didn't flinch at all. He was completely dismissive! He told me that I shouldn't worry too much and just left the room. \n\n\nAfter that incident, I noticed how Daniel started to look disheveled at times. He's a very tidy, well put-together man, you see, so this was completely out of the ordinary. At that point, I was sure that he was out messing with some other woman. The worst part is.... he started smelling like her too! \n\n\nEvery time I confronted him, he would change the subject or simply gaze sternly at me.

I squeezed as hard as I could,\u00a0 watching her squeal and wriggle like the pig she was until she stopped breathing. \n\n\nThough... there's one thing I realised.

It is maintained by the men of the city council and the work is done with the same devotion as the temple maidens of old. They have uniforms for the maintenance which is done every Sunday afternoon: brown loafers, khaki pants, and a short-sleeved button down shirt. A fedora is optional but highly encouraged. Most people in town believe the council's story about it being a historic site, you know, one of those century exhibits, and we get lots of tourists who come by to see the playground from the 50's. The town even retrofitted the house beside the playground to look like it was straight out of \\*Leave it to Beaver\\* for the tourism bucks.   \n\n  \nA few years back, the child of one of the tourists was found dead under the slide in the locked playground. Not just dead, though: the teen boy was ripped limb from limb and then laid out like a starfish with a long stick. It was gruesome and cost the city a pretty penny to deal with between the police investigation and the settlement with the family to get them to sign the NDA. Security cameras showed that the kid had ignored the locked gate and the No Entry signs before climbing over the fence as his brother egged him on. The story the council put in the paper was that a drifter had come through and done this horrible thing.   \n\n  \nI didn't find out the truth until last year when I married a councilman: the playground is haunted by an angry, angry child who died there because of bullying and faulty equipment. Some mean girls chased her up to the top of the climbing structure and then started throwing rocks at her. She dodged the rocks from up there while the girls laughed and then one of the bars broke under her and she fell. In the most unlucky circumstance, the bar that broke fell in such a way that she landed on it and it impaled her through the heart. She lived just long enough to hear the girls call her a stupid cow for breaking the playground.   \n\n  \nShe got her revenge. Each of those girls died over the next few weeks in ways connected to the playground but random enough that the powers that be didn't make the connection. It wasn't until the fourth child died that the council decided to close the playground. That wasn't enough to keep the girl happy \u2013 children started hearing her calling to them to come and play on the still broken climbing structure. That's when the Council fixed up the playground and started maintaining it like a time capsule and that's when the children stopped dying; she seems to be happy in her safe playground. \n\nShe does hate to be disturbed, though.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676578901.0,"comments":[{"author":"TinyATuin","text":"I liked this one!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678383849.0}]},{"title":"The Last Will and Testament of Bill Opie","author":"LithiumToxicity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/113kncq\/the_last_will_and_testament_of_bill_opie\/","text":"\"This video recording was made by me, William Opie, and it is to be my final will regarding my estate. My lawyer, Philip Gill is currently present as my witness.\n\nJohn, Simon and Bailey, my children, I trust Philip has brought you all to his office, as I instructed him, and you are now watching this video. You're all probably waiting eagerly to find out how much money you'll be getting from my estate. I suspect you've been longing for this day for some time now.\n\nUnfortunately my children, I will not be giving you anything but, rather, I will be taking something from you today.\n\nYou see, one of \u2026 I mean, three of the greatest mistakes in my life were having you three kids. Sure, with each new birth I was hopeful of having a wonderful child who'd enrich our lives. But you all turned out to be a terrible lot. You are unkind, greedy, ungrateful, rude and generally vicious people. For many decades you tormented your mother, Kim, and I so much that we always dreaded seeing you. Your abuses didn't end even in our old years and I am quite convinced that it was you who sent Kim to her early grave.\n\nAt the moment you must be wondering what it is that I'm going to take from you. Well, I'm taking no more than what I gave before. Today, I'm taking your lives, your lives that came from my flesh, your lives that took much of mine.\n\nYou will have noticed Philip\u2019s office is located quite far from the city. You probably drove a couple of hours to get there. That is not his office. Rather, it is a converted farmhouse which I bought a while ago for the purpose of carrying out this will. And the room you were led to is an underground chamber beneath that house. The man who met you at the office is not Philip but just a hired hand. Look around. He\u2019s not there any more is he? No. He doesn't know what is about to happen and will never know.\n\nYou will also notice the room you're in has no access except for the one door behind you which, as you will have guessed, is now bolted shut. It is a reinforced steel door, so forget about trying to break it.\n\nThat \u201coffice\u201d you are in is a living tomb I built for you, my children. You will die there in days to come. Don\u2019t think someone might find you because everything above that dungeon is being erased as I speak, including any evidence of you having been there. \n\nI imagine what\u2019s coming to you will be quite unpleasant since you have no water or food.

His bones mangled and blood dripping from his wide open twisted jaw. His crumpled head had landed on the gravelly tarmac in such a way that his eyes gazed into mine. I couldn\u2019t blame the distraught driver of that Range Rover, he never even saw him coming as he flew out into the road in front of him like a chaotic flash. \n\nThe shrill of the car horn and his terrified cry seemed to harmonise and echo throughout the busy street. The crowd of horrified onlookers gathered around him, as the surround filled with blue flashing lights and deafening sirens. It was though, unfortunately too late. He lost his life that day, on that road. I of course was so very upset. I didn\u2019t know how he could be so careless as to trip off that curb, and into the oncoming path of that two tonne lump of gleaming plastic and polished metal. I had tried so desperately to grab hold of his clothing to stop his stumble, well, that\u2019s what I told the police anyway.\n\nSo, just how, was this man stood at the foot of my bed. He was just staring, his hand held in front of him pointing at me, just as I was drifting slowly into my nightly slumber. His cold gaze and damning judgement was plastered all over his decrepit face. After all it wasn\u2019t my fault that he had tormented me every day for those five years at school. We had met all these years later to clear the air, we were about to go and grab a drink at the local bar. He almost had me fooled, the way he apologised and said how he had now matured and was settling down with his long time girlfriend. I didn\u2019t even want his pathetic excuse for an apology, the audacity of him, to play victim. \n\nI thought this would be the last of it, that his cruelty would now stop with his last breath. Yet  there he was his frail bloodless frame remained motionless as I lay, stuck in a paralysed state in one\u2019s pit.

The Dutch government had long since given up on the idea of saving their homeland by elevating it a mere twenty meters above sea level. They needed something more drastic, more ambitious. They needed to elevate their entire country to a height so great, that it would rival even the highest peaks of the Himalayas.\n\nThe project was called The Great Elevation and it was said to be the most colossal undertaking in human history. The Dutch government had commissioned the world's finest engineers and architects, and they had toiled for decades to make their dream a reality.\n\nThe Dutch people watched with both awe and horror as their land began to rise higher and higher, far beyond anything that anyone had ever seen before. The towering pillars upon which their new homeland stood were so enormous that they stretched into the clouds, seemingly reaching for the very stars themselves.\n\nBut as the years passed, something strange began to happen. The air pressure began to change, and the climate began to shift. The new land mass was so high that it disrupted the flow of air and water around the globe. The weather patterns around the world started to go awry. Storms of such magnitude and violence ravaged the planet that it seemed as though the world was on the verge of being consumed by chaos and destruction.\n\nThe Dutch people were the first to see the horror that they had unleashed upon the world. The world's climate had been changed forever, and the Great Elevation was to blame. The towering pillars that they had built had unleashed something beyond human comprehension, something that would haunt them for generations to come.\n\nAs the years passed, the Great Elevation became a legend, a myth, a story told in hushed whispers by those who dared to speak of it at all. The towering pillars remained, a testament to the hubris of the Dutch people and a reminder of the terror that they had unleashed.\n\nAnd yet, some say that the Great Elevation still stands, hidden from view, a towering testament to the power of human ambition and the horrors that can be unleashed when man reaches too far beyond his grasp.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676562068.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"even darkness need hugs","author":"shortstory1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/113py80\/even_darkness_need_hugs\/","text":"Even darkness itself needs hugs and you may not think it does, but darkness needs a hug now and then. When you go past a room where the light is off, just know that the darkness inside the room loves hugs and contact. So you should just go in and give it a hug, and to others it may just seem like you are hugging yourself in the darkness, but really you are hugging the darkness. You giving warmth and a bit of care to the darkness. Darkness is so lonely and mis-understood. Give the darkness hugs and show it some care. \n\nI have made it my mission to get people to hug darkness. So I rent out a room and never switch anything on, and it is in complete darkness. I bring people to hug darkness during night times, when darkness is more alive, stronger and can feel the warmth more. I got a new group who are going to hug the darkness and I take them for a walk around the area. We go past some undesirable people  who are basically creepy and outcasts in society. My group make comments about them in a negative tone. \n\nI take them somewhere to eat and then after eating, it's time to hug darkness. It was pitch black and the darkness definitely needed a hug. No one is allowed to use anythung that produces light inside this room. I tell everyone to start hugging the darkness and they do and they are loving it. \n\nPeople started to feel the darkness become more physical and that meant that the darkness just loved being hugged. The darkness was loving the hugs so much, the darkness was forming multiple bodies and this was to make it easier for the people to hug the darkness more. It was all going so well until a guy started using the torch light, when he wasn't supposed to. \n\nHe saw people hugging the undesirables they walked past outside, and I could tell with the look in his eyes, that he now knew this truth. There is no such thing as hugging darkness but rather this was a lie, this was all for the undesirable people in society to be hugged by desirable people. The darkness was to keep them covered as no one would want to go next to them and hug them, if they could see them. \n\nThe man with the torchlight realised that he was hugging a homeless alcoholic in the darkness, and he shouted at the top of his lungs. Then the rest started shouting and screaming and they all ran out, and they were all using torchlights now to see who was in the darkness. \n\nYou should hug the darkness from time to time, it gets so lonely and cold.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676552050.0,"comments":[{"author":"FeliBellie","text":"Nice story, but it would be better if ypu didnt use the word darkness so many times","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676563348.0}]},{"title":"An Undesirable Trait","author":"therealdocturner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1133s4p\/an_undesirable_trait\/","text":" \n\nI had been standing in the cold for twenty five hours and when I was finally ushered into the building, I risked a glance behind me at the long line of men and women.

It was as if the walls had eyes, and every creak and whisper was a sinister laugh directed at me. At first, I tried to brush it off as my own paranoia, but the feeling only grew stronger as time went on.\n\nThen the nightmares started. I would wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, with the sense that something was standing at the foot of my bed. I would hear whispers and moans, as if a multitude of voices were speaking to me from the shadows.\n\nAs the days went by, the incidents became more frequent and intense. I would see shadowy figures darting in and out of my peripheral vision, and sometimes I would hear footsteps echoing in the halls even though I was alone in the house.\n\nBut the worst was yet to come. One night, as I was lying in bed, I felt a cold breath on my face. I opened my eyes to see a figure hovering over me, its eyes glowing like embers in the darkness. It reached out to touch me, and I felt a chill run down my spine that seemed to freeze me to the core.\n\nI tried to scream, but my voice was caught in my throat.

The priest, old and frail, was delighted at the sight. His memory was not what it used to be, and even if it didn't mean much, he couldn\u2019t recall a Sunday mass this popular. Setting his bible to the side, he decided that simply reciting the holy book would not suffice for such an exceptional audience. Instead, the priest decided to speak from his heart.\n\nAs he began the sermon, he looked closer at the congregation. As usual, he saw the familiar faces of those who attended mass regularly. There were some people in the back rows with vaguely familiar features, like old friends from long ago. Straight down, sitting in the front-rows, were his children and their families. Father Elwood sparked with joy, having the opportunity to preach to his family once again. They had recently come to visit him, grandkids in tow, and now seeing them all attending mass warmed the old man\u2019s heart. \n\nThrough the sermon, the right passages of scripture flowed through him without thought, and his words came out tender and grateful. Concluding his speech, Father Elwood felt proud and joyous. After the congregation repeated the last Amen, they slowly started to get up from the pews. Father Elwood looked at the people before him, who shared not his joy, instead seeming solemn and serious. As the crowd started leaving the church, he pondered upon his sermon. Had he been too worldly? Perhaps he\u2019d taken too many liberties in the topics he\u2019d chosen? The more he thought about it, the more the situation mystified him.\n\nThe congregation had moved outside the church now, except for a few men. They started to walk towards Father Elwood, but as he greeted them they gave no reply. Instead, they walked right past him, without giving so much as a look. Frustrated, the priest turned to confront the men, to ask if he\u2019d offended them in some way.\n\nWhen he turned, he saw the men gathered around a coffin. The priest took a hasty step towards them, and in the decorated wooden casket, tucked between teal-colored silk sheets, was his body dressed in a black suit. The men stood in silence, and they all stared at the corpse of Father Elwood, including the priest himself. A man took a step towards the coffin, whom Father Elwood recognized as his brother. He hadn\u2019t seen him in years. His face had changed through the years, but oh how it was still so familiar to his heart.\n\nThe brother put his hands on the thick door of the coffin and lowered it, latching it shut.

It was an ordinary day, just like any other. My mother, grandmother, and I had gone to the local grocery store in our small town in Southwest Missouri. The trip was uneventful, as usual, but it felt like an eternity before we returned home.\nAs we drove back, the sun had just begun to set. I could still see fairly well, but I was eager to get home. When we arrived, my mother exclaimed, \"Trixie is out!\" Trixie was our family's large female Rottweiler. Looking in the direction she pointed, it indeed appeared like our dog was outside. However, my mother was worried that Trixie might see us and run across the highway, potentially putting herself in danger.\nIn a panic, I jumped on my bicycle and raced towards my grandparents' house, which was across the highway from our home. After a minute or so of cycling, I spotted a large, black creature. It was not a dog, nor was it a bear. I had no idea what it could be.\nAs I approached the creature, I locked up the brakes on my bike, causing it to skid sideways and crash to the ground. The creature then turned and looked straight at me. I froze in fear as the creature frantically ran and jumped over a barbed wire fence, disappearing into the woods.\nI quickly regained my composure, mounted my bike, and raced back to where my mother and grandmother were unloading groceries. I told them about what I had seen, but they were just as puzzled as I was. Trixie was in the yard, so they knew it wasn't our dog.\nThe sighting of the unknown creature sent shivers down my spine, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. The image of the creature's eyes glaring at me was seared into my memory, and it haunted me for many sleepless nights.\nDespite my terror, I continued to explore the very same woods where I had seen the creature. I never encountered anything else like it again, but stories in the area persisted of a black panther or a family of large black cats. However, I had never seen any evidence of such creatures, and I was pretty sure that I would have recognized a panther if I had seen one.\nAs I grew older, I continued to venture into the wilderness to hunt and fish in Missouri, but I never encountered any such animal again. This experience, though terrifying, taught me that the world is full of creatures that we don't understand, and it made me appreciate the mysteries of the natural world even more.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1676495441.0,"comments":[{"author":"MarineroRon","text":"This is an interesting thing.

The feeling of floating never went away, I still feel it now on land with years after I was founded by another ship. I was later told I was the last one to survive, no man on board made it. I told the story many times before, too many times that it doesn\u2019t seem like my own story. How could someone just explode into ocean water uninjured except a few burn marks? I told my story to TV newscasters and church preachers on radios; all of them tried to make me feel like what happened to me was some miracle. I felt the guilt when I had to attend the funerals of the men that had no story to tell, just an empty grave with willow wives and fatherless children. I soon stop telling my story but I never told the full story. One story I will never tell out loud for fear that they will think i'm some bum looking for more camera action.I had my fame. Now all I have is the fear of what I really saw. \nI was on the ocean on my back riding the ocean, being carried  out nowhere. I became hungry, delusional, with dehydrated cramps. I became  badly sunburned. It was nothing but a deep horizon of water with nothing behind that. I thought of drowning, a easy way out I guess. away from the heat into the forever water. Cool soft water. \nMy mother was there, I saw her in my reflection when I look at the water. I was looking in or she was looking out. behind her a dark void. \"Mother.\" I said \"is death comfortable.\" She didn't say anything. I saw our old kitchen in this reflection and I saw her sitting in a chair like a spotlight of memories.  Like she never died and I had my childhood heart of my sleeve. The kitchen window was open and the rain came in. \"I want to blow my fucken head off baby. I'm sorry. It's your father, he is too awful to me.\" And I said \"mom please don't  talk like that.\" I cried to her. I want her to hold me and not think like that. Kiss me to make sure she couldn't say those things. \"Some times I want to die. It's not your fault. I promise. Maybe it is. I don't  know.\" I cried harder and usually she will stop talking like this when I did this. I got angry and yelled \"Get away from me!\" When I open my eyes I saw the white face beast with his large eye on me in the water. \"Baby I know it hurts. It's hurts me to.\" It said without moving with his one eye slowly blinking. \"He hurts me too.\" And I said, \"Shut up!\" It drifted lower away with my mother's voice crying in agony. Then he shot up and push the mattress. I screamed. I squeeze tight with  my eyes shut as it pushes. \"He doesn't  hurt me anymore  mom.

But he\u2019ll persevere. Perhaps one of these times\u2026\n\nThen the machines can raze it, flatten the terrain. Maybe they\u2019ll put up a parking lot or a mall.

A strange figure produced a long, semi-transparent instrument filled with blue liquid. They pressed their finger against the instrument and it started whirring a high pitched squeal. The figure next to them raised a finger to their mouth.\n\nI could hear the high pitched whirring get louder as it neared my ear canal.

She remembered that almost overnight their luck began to turn around, and that shortly after her mother vanished without a trace. Kristen then recalled how her sister Kali disappeared from her dorm on her 21st birthday.\n\nAs Kristen pondered these things, she could feel her arms and legs going deeper into her torso as if her whole body was closing in on itself. She turned her head to look at the mirror, and to her horror saw that her whole body had begun to evaporate, leaving her with just her organs, spine, and head.\n\nPiece by piece, each of her remaining internal organs shrunk to the size of a pea before disappearing from sight.

Before she could react, her classmate swiftly walked back to his seat, ignoring the confused look she sent his way at him. Janice opened the envelope, revealing a white sheet of paper mottled with pink writing.\n\nIt read:\n\n\u201cDear Janice,\n\nMy heart stops every time I see you. Your eyes are as deep and blue as the sea. Your hair is as bright and golden as the sun. Your teeth are as pure and white as pearl. You are beautiful, and no other girl would compare.\n\nWill you be my Valentine?\n\nLove, Kenneth\u201d\n\nJanice put the paper down, her cheeks on fire. Kenneth never seemed like the sort of boy who liked girls like her. This had to be some sort of prank. She was just about to question him on the subject before the teacher entered the class. She would just have to talk to him later.\n\nAfter a mind-numbingly boring series of classes and lectures, Janice exited the school and scanned her surroundings for her unprecedented Valentine. He was nowhere to be seen. So she shrugged and left for home.\n\n- - -\n\nSitting comfortably on her bed, Janice took out the letter and narrowed her eyes at it in disbelief. The wording had changed.\n\nIt now said:\n\n\u201cDear Jake,\n\nI have fallen deeply in love with you. The way you smile brings me joy beyond description. The way you talk brings me happiness beyond words. The way you laugh brings me euphoria beyond belief. You are the most wonderful boy in the world.\n\nWill you be my Valentine?\n\nLove, Janice\u201d\n\nHer hands trembled as she held onto the note. It was even in her handwriting.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of sick joke is this?\u201d she muttered.\n\nThen the message changed before her eyes.\n\nNow there were only six words on it, still in the same awful shade of pink.\n\n\u201cFind him or face the consequences\u201d\n\n---\n\nJake was her best friend since childhood and lived only a few houses away. Since a few years ago, Janice had fallen head over heels for him, though he never knew. But if confessing her feelings for him would get rid of this cursed letter, it had to be done. She ran all the way to his house and prepared to slip the envelope into his mailbox. But she could not.\n\nIf giving him the letter meant he would have to deal with the curse, she could not do that to him. The cycle had to end here. She took the letter out of the envelope, preparing to rip it to shreds.\n\nWhat she saw chilled her to her bones.\n\n\u201cToo Late\u201d\n\nA stabbing pain spread through her chest. Janice dropped to the ground in agony. The words of the love letter echoed back to her.

A bedroom. Unfamiliar and frightening. The floorboards creeked with terrifying effect.\u00a0\n\n\nThe room was practically empty, barring the old and rusted bed with the heavily soiled mattress on top. Maybe it wasn't rust...maybe it was, blood?...One thing's for sure, this room was designed for nightmares.\n\n\nThere was just one window and one door. I pushed down on the handle and rattled back and forth.\n\n\n*Damnit. Locked.*\n\n\n\"We have to find a key.\" Said a familiar voice from the corner of the room. \"Start looking.\"\n\n\nIt was my friend, Tony, who was now kneeling on the dust-filled floor and frantically searching under the bed.\u00a0\n\n\n\"An-Anything?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"Errm...No...No, there's nothing here.\" He stood back up and looked around. He knew this place better than I did.\u00a0\n\n\n\"But, you've been here before, right?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"Yeah, but it changes place everytime, so I never know where to look. So, you need to help me, ya know, before we run out of time and they show up.\"\n\n\n\"Shit, sorry. It's just, it's a lot creepier than I imagined.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, just come on. Find the key.\"\n\n\nWe ripped up floorboards until our fingers seemed to bleed, and we tore away at the mattress until there was nothing but shreads. But...nothing.\n\n\n\"Okay...the last place to try,\" Said Tony, \"is the window...but, its dangerous.\"\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\"It allows them to get in the house faster.\"\n\n\n\"How much faster?\"\n\n\n\"...Immediately.\"\n\n\nI walked quite briskly towards the window.\n\n\n\"Dude, wait, we're not prepared yet.\"\n\n\nI was at the window staring out. My fingers lightly resting on the latch. \"I...I think...I think I can see them...Shit! Oh shit! Dude, dude, I can see them! They're coming!\" In my frantic moment, I accidently knocked the window latch, causing it to fly wide open.\u00a0\n\n\n*TING!*\n\n\nA small metal object dropped to the floor between my feet.\n\n\n\"The key!\" I shouted.\n\n\n\"Yes! Come on, quick!\" Tony shouted back. \"We need to get downstairs!\"\n\n\nI could hear them bashing down the doors as I put the key in the lock. I could hear them breaking windows and scuttling around the house.\n\n\n*CLUNK*\n\n\nThe door finally unlocked...We could hear them coming up the stairs, and Tony gulped hard.\n\n\n\"It's too late...They're here.\"\n\n\nThere was a moment of silence before they burst through the door. There were hundreds of them; A constant stream of the undead, all with melted skin and a strong taste for human flesh.\n\n\nThey got Tony instantly. His blood splattered and sprayed across the room with every bite. When they'd finished, his body disappeared, and the diseased undead were now all facing me.\n\n\nTrapped in the corner of the room, with no weapons and no Tony, I took the easy way out...I pressed the button and took off my headset...\n\n\n\"What the hell, dude!\" Said Tony, who was sat next to me on the couch. \"Okay, lets go again, but this time, don't pussy out and exit the game!\"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676338502.0,"comments":[{"author":"Bugley15","text":"Oh, my goodness!

Simple logic for you all. Any how my girlfriend has been letting me stay with her in her bedroom and I can tell her room mate doesn't like me. My girlfriend has been getting up early to go to work and as I hear the front door close, I get a little worried for her room mate. She is just horrible to me and I have tried being nice but nothing's working. \n\nI'm trying to be nice but I guess she thinks I am free loading by sleeping in the same bedroom as my girlfriend, it's only for a couple of months. I have had some arguments between this female room mate and I guess our personalities don't match. Then we go back to our rooms and my girlfriend comes back in and all is fine. Recently the female room mate has been acting erratic towards me for some odd reason, every time my girlfriend goes out to work. The female room mate never comes out of her room when my girlfriend is in the apartment. \n\nI know she is going to ruin valentines day for me and my girlfriend, and one day after having another argument with the female room mate when my girlfriend was at work, I just snapped and killed her, just like that. I put her body in her room and I will wait for my girlfriend to come back and enjoy valentines day, then I will tell her. My girlfriend hadn't come home in the usual time she comes home. I waited and waited but she wasn't coming home. \n\nThen I started scrolling through my girlfriends pictures and used an app called makapp, it took away the make up, because it took away the make up. Then I was shocked to realise that she looked exactly like the room mate. I started phoning her and the female room mate who I had just killed, her phone started ringing. My girlfriend told me never to call or text her when she is at work, because she is too busy to answer and she puts her phone away. \n\nNow I then went up to the female room mates dead body and I started applying make up to her face. She started to look like my girlfriend, I have never seen her without make up before. Her lap top was also present and she had written posts about how she was worried about me seeing her without make up, and made up a small test if you like by pretending to be someone else. She never had a room mate. \n\nShe looked really different without make up.

She would be here in half an hour, and I hadn\u2019t even begun to prepare a meal! The pantry door flew open for me to search for something suitable for the occasion. Cauliflower? Mashed potatoes? Pasta with white sauce? That was my best bet. As I finished plating the meal, the daydreams returned. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever met. And she was mine. Her *heart* was mine.

Just like every valentine in the past. I shushed her. Quietly, I pulled out the knife that had been hidden.

Red, the color of love. Her heart was carefully set on the plate. It colored the sauce red. Red, the color of love. And finally, it stained the rose red. Red, the color of love. I feasted the same as I had every year prior, savoring every bite. Her heart was mine, after all.\n\nThen, it was time to rest again, and in 11 months, I would find a new love.

For one, she\u2019d been wearing the same dirty clothes for a week. She also noticed the other kids weren\u2019t talking to Heaven or playing with her anymore. That didn\u2019t matter to Destiny. Heaven would always be her friend.\n\nThat afternoon Destiny stopped by her friend\u2019s house on the way to the park. She didn\u2019t know much about Heaven\u2019s family, just that Heaven spent most of her days outside. She didn\u2019t like spending time at home.\n\nA man in a dirty shirt answered the door. She wasn\u2019t sure if this was Heaven\u2019s dad or not.\n\n\"Hey, is Heaven coming to the playground today?\"\n\nHe stared at her for a long time.\n\n\"Come on in.

They turned the corner and he opened another door, revealing a basement staircase. \n\n\"She's down there.\"\n\nDestiny was unsure- but she trusted parents.\n\n\"She is?\" She took a tentative step. \n\n\"Yep. She\u2019s been playing down there all week.\"\n\nHe gave her a shove, and she tumbled down the stairs. Shocked, she looked back up at the man in the doorframe.\n\n\"Say hello to Heaven for me, won't you?\" He said, slamming the door. \n\nDestiny screamed as she was plunged into darkness.

What a stupid name.\n\nIt was no coincidence he resembled Ted Bundy, even if they portrayed it that way. He'd studied Ted Bundy's behaviour for the sole reason of replicating it. He was charmed by the idea of hunting people with pretended harmlessness.\n\nA coincidence means that two or more things, despite happening independently of each other, add up to something for someone. A coincidence was that all three of us happened to be called Cynthia.\n\nNobody ever realised this, because it was so exciting. The \"Cynthia Killer\" made such delicious headlines. But in reality, he didn't even know our names before the police came asking questions. The directors of the show made up some sob story about his \u201dchildhood love\u201d called Cynthia, as a weak explanation for why he was so interested in us. But he only chose us because he thought he could get away with killing us.\n\nAnd he did.\n\nThe evidence against him was extensive. He was the prime suspect, and later the only one. The police spent years searching and interrogating, and everyone was certain it was him. But he never confessed, and our bodies were never found. Nobody could prove we were dead. So he walked out a free man.\n\nAnd now people are buying subscriptions to see *Coincidences*, portraying the tragic story of a hurt little boy who grew up to be accused of a triple murder just because he cOiNciDEnTaLLy resembled a famous psychopath.\n\nHe's famous, and I'm just \u201dthe second Cynthia\u201d. A plot device for telling his story.\n\nThe writers of that show made up some shadowy crook, \u201dthe real killer who was never caught\u201d, so they could show artistic interpretations of what really happened to us Cynthias. I got 32 seconds of screen time when my actor was buried in Oakwood Creek (or in reality, somebody's back yard that played the part of Oakwood Creek in the show). \n\nSince the writers couldn't use any of the places the police had really investigated, they had to choose the most reasonable disposal site out of the ones that hadn't been searched. A place near where we lived, where nobody would find us. They just looked at a map, made some measurements, and pointed to a secluded little corner in Oakwood Creek. \u201dYup, that's where I'd bury three bodies\u201d.\n\nAnd that happens to be the exact place where he really did bury us. That's coincidence for you.\n\nBut instead of being awarded for their investigative journalism, the writers are handed Emmys. While I'm here with my bones bare, since everything I had to rot has already rotted away. My skeleton fingers coincidentally intertwined with those of the third Cynthia, who was just... dumped on top of me. We're right here in the ground, where the internet's most popular series showed us to be.\n\nAnd nobody has still come for us.\n\nInstead, they're sending love letters to the man who hid us here.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676286060.0,"comments":[{"author":"Sprattus_Sprattus","text":"This story may or may not be inspired by how the Netflix show about Jeffrey Dahmer was received by audience.\n\nMore sadness and death in r\/awfish.","upvotes":52,"created_utc":1676286900.0},{"author":"fireworks435","text":"Woah, really cool perspective, I love how jaded she is.

If I chopped up my room mate, then the rent could be split in many more ways, and it sounded like a terrific idea. \n\nYeah I definitely feel that I was being serious and not joking about chopping up my room mate into many pieces.

This always freaks me out. I'm so pathetic, I always jump onto my bed and hide under the blanket, silently crying just waiting for it to go away. I try to sleep but I can't. This has caused me many sleepless nights and my grades in school have been plummeting due to my lack of sleep. I barely even interact with my family because I'm too traumatized to even speak. This monster has really taken a toll on my health. So, I decided that I was going to fight back. I take some rotisserie chicken and put it on the table by my bed as a trap for the monster. However, there's a catch; I crush up rat poison and stuff it into the chicken. Perhaps meat could entice the monster?\n\nThis morning, I woke up. The rotisserie chicken was completely eaten. Perhaps this had destroyed the monster? I go out of my room and pour myself a bowl of cereal. I hear a bunch of crying in the bathroom.

She died when I was fifteen, so for most of my childhood, Henrietta was there.\n\nDumb name for a dog, right? My Momma had taken one look at her, as a puppy, and said \"she's a Henrietta,\" and the name stuck!\n\nHenrietta was a big dumb bouncing bundle of fluff. Mongrels tend to be half of one breed, half of another; Henrietta was about eight dogs rolled into one. She was somehow clumsy AND gentle, cowardly AND brave; her coat was matted no matter how much it'd been combed, and muddy no matter how long she'd been bathed.\n\nAnd Henrietta's fur always, ALWAYS smelled wet. In rural Arizona it could be bone-dry outside, yet she'd still somehow smell musty and damp, like half-sunken rotting boats abandoned on a lake.\n\nI hated that smell, which permeated everything so much that people would hold their noses when I went to school.\u00a0\n\nBut when Henrietta died, how I longed, so dreadfully, for that smell to return.\u00a0\n\nIt had just been my momma and Henrietta and me, and so I'd not known loss. The grief ate away like the oceans tide, receding a little then returning with all of it's might.\n\nUntil I smelled Henrietta again.\u00a0\n\nIt was the night my momma brought a boyfriend home, from the office. She called him a friend, but I wasn't stupid. And neither was Henrietta.\n\nThe only times I'd known Henrietta to snarl and bare her teeth was when a bad person had been around, like the creepy mailman who'd linger too long asking personal questions on the porch.\n\nMomma said that dogs always know when a person is bad. \"You can't fool an animal\".\n\nIt's just as well that Henrietta was such a good judge of character, because Momma sure wasn't. My dad was garbage, by all accounts. He took most of our stuff when he left us, including my Furby to sell. I was too young to remember him, but I saw fear on momma's face whenever I asked about dad.\n\nMomma's friend didn't stay long. He started sneezing, then yelled at my momma for not telling him she had a dog. Apparently my Momma should've known about his allergies. He called her a very ugly word.\n\nWhen I went to college, Henrietta followed me, too. Whenever I'd walk home alone at night, I'd smell wet dog. They assigned me a room-mate who propositioned me over-and-over, until she left after a terrible recurring nightmare about a dog sitting, snarling, on her chest.\n\nI'd wondered if Henrietta was watching over momma too, until the day she telephoned, stunned, to say that her friend from the office had tried to break into her house whilst she slept inside; in a freakish twist-of-fate, he'd been killed whilst climbing backwards through a window, by a cougar or a bear, on account of his horrific injuries from an animal's teeth. And on account of the terrible smell.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676239253.0,"comments":[{"author":"Bugley15","text":"Good Henrietta \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc15","upvotes":39,"created_utc":1676258799.0},{"author":"Banana_Mommy","text":"A nice wholesome scary!","upvotes":23,"created_utc":1676262332.0},{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Henrietta is wonderful!","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1676260200.0},{"author":"SometimesGlad1389","text":"Love it!","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1676257970.0},{"author":"songfullsilvermoon","text":"I loved it!

I lay amongst the hidden stars, reduced by foliage. A jungle in its likeness, it breeds danger like no other.\nSt paul, Minneapolis, some of the bigger cities have after hours that are vastly different. I went to the city once; i looked up and saw a foggy sky. \nTonight i looked up and saw the moon. \nAt dusk i decide to traverse outside. I walked past where i feel comfortable. Im lost in the trees, and reach out to the clouds. I find myself imbedded in fir trees. Shadows projected overhead seem endless. The moon is bright and walks beside me. \nA small noise disturbs the quiet. Once at peace, i now feel guarded. Leaves crunch under something unnatural. \nI feel an encrouching danger, an evil form like no other. I hear a howl which divides me; should i run? Should i fight? Whatever it may be, i sense it, and it knows me. \nIve heard of skin walkers before, in fact, i heard they came from Minnesota. This doomed me only further.\nI gazed into the forest, a low growl permeated around me. I froze. Nightmares had been more kind. I noticed something small that began to grow. A leg, a torso, my undoing. i stared upon my enemy. They were me. Mirrored it reached out. I saw myself in the darkness.

Especially by those nerdy looking guys going around tearing down walls. If they could do it, I could do it. So, with my wife's 30th birthday coming up in a couple of months I decided to surprise her with something truly special.\n\nWe'd been living in a small little apartment for a couple of years now. Living modestly to save up for a home of our own one day. Then while browsing the home apps that day came and the perfect deal fell right into my lap. Something so unbelievably cheap I couldn't believe it. We had enough to buy it outright and knowing it wouldn't last long I made our cash offer without reading so much as a single detail.\n\nI met the realtor at their office and took the keys. I expected them to be excited for me but I could only see a look of confusion and then worry after I told them about my plans for the home. Odd for sure but I wasn't going to let anything stop me and my plan.\n\nI arrived at the home and it sure did look worse in person. Every window had a crack, old faded paint peeling all over, the roof was worn away. An ugly piece of crap but it was our ugly piece of crap. Soon to be our forever home.\n\nI started with the interior walls sanding away at the old cracking paint. Some funky 70s color from what I could see despite the fading all around. I went room by room and sanded each wall smooth. My mask had gotten far too nasty to wear anymore so the last few rooms I just held my breath. The air got really heavy with dust so I decided to give it some time to filter through.\n\nThen I got around to dealing with the ugly popcorn ceilings. Our apartment had them and we hated the look so I for sure wasn't going to let our forever home deal with that. I got my scraper and went to town on it. Scraping the ceiling until it was as smooth and white as the walls. This dust was very fine and seemed to stay in the air as it came down. Wearing a mask while working was almost impossible with how hot and stuff it got so again I left it off. \n\nWith the ceilings and walls ready I decided to take another break. I was feeling especially short of breath lately with this nasty cough that started up not too long after starting the renovation. Figured I was just getting sick. Dirty house you know. I'm sure in no time I'll be back up and ready to tackle the green and black stains in the kitchen and bathrooms.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676282833.0,"comments":[{"author":"iShitSkittles","text":"Asbestos dust, proven to be lethal when in contact with humans.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1676285038.0},{"author":"BuckbeaktheCaique","text":"Lead paint, asbestos, deadly molds.

Unfortunately, it did not take long before he became disoriented and lost his sense of direction.\n\nAs he turned around another corner, Dave could feel an overwhelming sense of dread building up inside him. The darkness seemed to swallow up the edges of his vision, and at that moment, he knew something terrible would happen to him if he did not find a way out soon.\n\nHe pressed on, hoping it would eventually lead him out of the building. As he walked, the hallway seemed to change and warp around him, becoming longer and more twisted with each passing moment. Slowly, strange whispers started to echo around Dave. He turned around to see who was there, heart pounding in his chest, but no one was there. As the whispers grew louder, Dave realised that the voices seemed to be coming from inside his head. \n\nPanicked and getting more paranoid by the minute, he started running until he finally saw a door. Relieved that he had found a way out, he quickly turned the doorknob. Only to be instantly disappointed and frightened when he was greeted by pitch-black darkness. Instinctively Dave took a step back. The whispers becoming unbearably loud now. He closed his eyes and grabbed his head out of despair, only to be snapped back to reality when he felt something cold and wet touching his arm. Upon opening his eyes, he saw a shadowed figure with long, bony fingers reaching out from beyond the darkness. He screamed and slammed the door shut, leaving the figure pounding on the door. \n\nAs he continued running, the walls began to morph into grotesque, faceless figures.

Don\u2019t worry, a glimpse of period blood won\u2019t kill you! It will make up for all your poop and pee I had to deal with when you were a baby.\u201d\n\nJack threw himself on his bed, seething. Killing Aunt Trudie had not lessened his rage, and he couldn\u2019t stop about thinking about ways to kill Mom and Mia. It couldn\u2019t be another accident. \n\nKilling Aunt Trudie had been ridiculously easy- a quick push down the stairs when noone was around, running down after her and breaking her neck as she lay helpless and twisted on the landing. Nothing had felt so good in his life. As a strong teenaged boy, Aunt Trudie hadn\u2019t the proverbial snowball\u2019s chance in hell to survive once Jack had finally determined to kill her. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t because she menstruated of course! He wasn\u2019t that shallow. It was in revenge for his father, whom he knew she had killed many years ago. Jack had been three and Mia just a baby when their dad was killed in a car accident. Aunt Trudie had moved in to \u201chelp\u201d, and she had never moved out again. Jack couldn\u2019t prove it, but he just knew she must have done it- her delight at living with Mom and \u201cbeing part of the family\u201d screamed guilty. And so, eventually, after years of brooding and hating, he killed her. \n\nThe memory of the soft snap of her neck calmed him. He got up from bed, went to his computer, and started chatting with his online friends.   \n\nThe unflushed clots in the toilet twitched as Aunt Trudie\u2019s ghost breathed life into them. She knew Jack was planning to kill her darling friend and she didn\u2019t have a lot of time. The smaller clots coalesced. Mom being in perimenopause, there was a lot. \n\nClot crawled out of the toilet and plopped on the ground with a soft wet slap. Then it began moving towards Jack\u2019s bedroom. It slithered in easily from underneath the door. Jack was sitting with his headphones on, his back to the door, and thus did not see the glistening Clot moving across the floor towards him, climbing his chair. The first he knew was when the stench of period blood hit his mouth and nostrils, filling them. \n\nAnd that was the last thing he knew, as Clot suffocated him silently.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676210406.0,"comments":[{"author":"finalgranny420","text":"Oh ewwwwwwwwwwww","upvotes":142,"created_utc":1676214472.0},{"author":"pocket-sauce","text":"I just gave my most reluctant upvote ever.

Extinction was right around the corner. AI, green energy, the exuberance of human achievement, it was all worth shit. The planet was becoming inhabitable. Our destiny was death.\n\nBefore we could invent a solution, salvation fell in our lap.\n\nWater evolved. That is to say, it stopped being liquid.\n\nIt stopped moving. All of it. The constant churning of ocean waves instantly immobilized. What state of matter it was, was hard to say. But it wasn\u2019t liquid.\n\nInstead of striking fear into people's hearts, the human race rejoiced. You could walk through water like it wasn\u2019t there. You could breathe in it.

They would eventually all die, but we had already pushed most oceanic species to extinction.\n\nThink about the real estate! A new utopia! \n\nThe motionless water created an immaculate climate; cool, temperate but sunny. You could plant most crops down there, and the wet atmosphere benefited growth. \n\nOn the surface, everything was dying. Most days were too hot, the winters too cold. There wasn\u2019t any space. Everything covered in concrete, abandoned parking lots, empty and expansive office buildings. Crowded and desolate.\n\nUnder the water, there was a new and glorious hope. Soon, every country was developing the ocean floor. A migration and cultivation never seen in human history.\n\nNo one asked why water stopped moving. Why could you walk through it and still breathe? Water couldn\u2019t be intelligent; the source of life couldn\u2019t be nefarious. No. The prudent thing was to move under the sea, and almost everyone did.\n\nNestled under the immobile and comfortable ocean, humans flourished. Soon, a majority of people found themselves living in the greatest real estate in six millennia.\n\nThat\u2019s when water enacted its final, patient plan.\n\nThere was no warning. All at once, water returned to form; it became liquid again. The ocean crashed and collapsed back to its chaotic majesty.

Two girls around my age, standing in the distance among the trees.\n\nAs I drew closer, I realized something was odd about the girls. I couldn't quite make out their features. They seemed out of focus somehow. A strange kind of energy filled the air. Birds stopped singing, and what sunlight was left disappeared. I closed and rubbed my eyes, clearly tired. As I opened them, the two girls faded into darkness.\n\nI was alone again.\n\nA sense of dread slowly enveloped me.\n\nI shouldn't be here.\n\n\"Sean...\" A voice called my name. It floated through the breeze, wrapping around me like a cool embrace. My heart pounded in my chest as I warily crept towards the source of the voice.\n\nSuddenly, a playground appeared within an ominous beam of moonlight that penetrated the thick canopy overhead.\n\nThe playground appeared long abandoned. Still, the rusty equipment creaked and groaned in a melancholy tune, as if recently used. I approached cautiously, half expecting the two girls to jump out and scare me.\n\nI swear I could see small figures dancing in and out of the moonlight.\n\nI tried to approach them. But as I got close, they scattered, disappearing back into the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a plea for help, whispered in desperation. I turned to see a young boy staring at me, eyes wide and pleading.\n\n'Help us,' he said. 'Please.'\n\nI took a step towards him, but he vanished.\n\n\"Hello, Sean.\"\n\nI froze. The voice came from behind me. Slowly, I turned and saw the girls hovering just above the ground.\n\n'Who are you?'

We won't hurt you. We just want to play.\"\n\nI ran as fast as I could, but still couldn't shake the girls. They kept pace with me, laughing the whole time.

He was crying. \n\n\u201cYou made me do it,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI killed your mom, I\u2019ll kill you, and then I\u2019ll kill myself. You destroyed our life, you fucking witch!\u201d\n\nEverything went dark. We couldn\u2019t see anything. I tried to quietly escape from the house. Then my father shot at the ceiling to illuminate the room for a fraction of a second.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to hide from me! You deserve to die!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d we heard a deep voice behind me. \u201cYou, you alcoholic bastard, you deserve to die.\u201d\n\nI heard my father screaming in pain, then heard his bones breaking for a few seconds. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little one,\u201d the voice whispered. I\u2019d never heard it before, but I knew it was the entity that talked to my mother when I was born. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be safe.\u201d\n\nThe lights turned back on, and I could see my father\u2019s mangled corpse lying near the door. He finally died. He killed my mother, and he wanted to kill me. He died a painful death, at least.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676189803.0,"comments":[{"author":"Ginerva-Weasley","text":"W entity","upvotes":20,"created_utc":1676197887.0},{"author":"Srphtygr","text":"Based nightmare creature from the blackness between stars","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1676232842.0},{"author":"Thrawn911","text":"Thank you for reading!\r  \n\r  \nTo see more of my work, please visit me at r\/polgari.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1676189844.0},{"author":"8Tiny-","text":"Epic","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676203766.0}]},{"title":"The Oak Tree","author":"Intrepid-Craft1802","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/110kh05\/the_oak_tree\/","text":"\n\n\n\nKate ran, but no matter how hard she ran, he would catch up.He  always caught up with her no matter how many times, it would always have the same fatal end.\u00a0 \n\nOther times the game would end with her dead by the trees.\u00a0 \n\nThis was the most plausible final\u00a0 \n\nBut right now she felt she would make it she ran and no matter how much her bare feet hurt in the thorns she would keep going.\u00a0 \n\nShe had stopped listening to him chasing her she had believed this was her last day in hell.\u00a0 \n\nShe saw the light before her.

That information could come about, when you go down the rabbit hole of Wikipedia. It could come about from watching video after video on Youtube. It could come from the constant debates between the left side and right side of politics. Or, in the case of Henry, it could come about the good old fashioned way\u2026reading a book.\n\nHenry Gordon was the chief librarian in the Forest Hills library. Approaching 70 years old, and already 5 years past retirement, Henry knew everything there was to know, about the books in the library. You want to read Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, Henry could grab it for you in 5 seconds. You want to read about the fall of the Berlin Wall? Henry could guide you to five different books on the subject. No matter the subject, no matter the author, if the book was there, Henry would know where it was.\n\nWhich is why, on the day in question, Henry was surprised by a book that had been returned by someone. It was a book all about the power of audio, or more specifically, music and songs. Not being familiar with the book, Henry decided to sit down and start reading it in his spare time. And what he discovered, was that Music has a way of influencing life, more than anyone ever realised.\n\nWhen Henry got home from the library that night, he decided to put this power of music, to the test. Henry\u2019s second love, was the piano\u2026and while he was never as good as someone playing in an orchestra, he was good enough to sometimes be asked to play at special events for friends and family. Henry started playing a tune on the piano, a nice, pleasant, happy tune. After around ten or so minutes of playing, Henry decided to get up and get a drink. He walked passed a window, which lets him see his neighbours, and saw a huge smile on Mr. Budden\u2019s face\u2026something he had never seen before.\n\nAfter having his drink, Henry started thinking more, about the power of music, and what it could do. On his other side, lived an old couple\u2026Gladys and Dominic Constance. While Henry had no problems with Gladys, Dominic would complain about anything, and everything. If the bins are not brought in one minute after emptying, Dominic would complain. If the smell from Henry\u2019s cooking was wafting through his yard, Dominic would complain.\n\nHaving had enough abuse over the years, Henry got to work. He started playing a really dark, almost demonic, style of song on the piano. It was so severe, tears were coming to Henry\u2019s eyes. The only reason he stopped, was because Gladys was knocking on the door. Henry answered, and Gladys spoke. \u201cHenry, please, can you stop with the music. It is Dominic\u2026you are killing him, with your song.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676205505.0,"comments":[{"author":"Difficult-Rope1010","text":"Someone took levels of bard, still well written:)","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676218434.0},{"author":"thepenguin68","text":"Henry needs to kill him softly with his song","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676348210.0},{"author":"giraffesonstilts","text":"I was getting into the story but cannot finish.

So we both stewed silently. But as fighting goes. It's when the lid leaves no room to breathe, that the pot boils over. And simple things start feeling like deliberate acts of animosity.\n\nFirst, I didn't open the chips. How was I suppose to know he wanted chips?\n\nI'm cold. Then you should wear a jacket. I turned off the a\/c. We drove in silence for almost a mile before he turned it back on. I'm cold. Look, I can't take off more clothes without it becoming some sort of felony.

The nurses had never seen such a happy newborn \u2014 didn\u2019t even cry once. That continued through his infant and toddler years; his parents never saw him shed a tear. When he was hungry or tired he\u2019d laugh until his little voice was hoarse. \n\nOnce he reached school age, Boingo was bullied mercilessly. He was the freak whose wide smile never faded. Even the teachers found his unchanging expression disturbing. \n\nBoingo almost never spoke. Just about the only noise you\u2019d ever hear him make was unprompted laughter. His parents were worried, but they could never get through to him.\n\nAs a young adult, Boingo became a clown and joined a traveling circus. As a clown, his smile and laughter were part of his act, but when the makeup came off, it wasn\u2019t so funny anymore. The other performers kept their distance. Something just wasn\u2019t right about Boingo the Clown. \n\nYears later Boingo was imprisoned for a series of heinous murders. The news media had dubbed him the \u2018Laughing Maniac\u2019 \u2014 and the moniker fit all too well. Boingo had killed dozens of people, and those who were able to escape described a monster who couldn\u2019t stop laughing as he hacked his victims to pieces. Even worse, the victims were laughing too.  \n\nBoingo was sentenced to death \u2014 he keeled over with laughter when the verdict was read. The jury and judge also chortled until their bellies hurt. Even those who watched the proceedings live on air couldn\u2019t help but grin. His joy was infectious. \n\nWhen he was led to his execution, the guard escorting him was cracking up. By the time they reached the gas chamber, the guard couldn\u2019t breathe \u2014 he died from asphyxiation a short time later. Boingo just stared and smiled. \n\nThe priest couldn\u2019t even make it through the last rites. He had to leave the room because he was laughing too hard. The victim families watched with sullen faces as the gas filled Boingo\u2019s lungs, but soon they too were giggling like school girls. \n\nBefore his eyes closed forever, Boingo waved to the onlookers and smiled so wide his cheeks almost split open. That expression never left his face even after his heart stopped beating. \n\nA chorus of laughter filled the room. The victims' families stood up and clapped, asking in unison for an encore. \n\nLater that night a baby was born at a hospital nearby. He didn\u2019t cry, not even a single tear \u2014 all he did was smile.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676145940.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheMidnightProfessor","text":"A skill not enough of us have is to laugh at ourselves -- but when does that skill become a curse?

She knew beyond a shadow of the doubt- she couldn\u2019t pretend anymore. She had known since I was born, she must have, as had the midwife and nurses who delivered me. But they all carefully suppressed knowledge. After all, there I was, a healthy-looking baby, who still needed care.\n\nDespite being dead.\n\nMy mom picked up the knife.

I kept myself secluded and distant, because I didn\u2019t want anyone looking into my eyes and digging a knife into me, and then killing themselves.\n\nBut by the time I was fifteen, Aunt Gloria kept asking me about my period.

Every time I try to sleep, this... thing comes at me. It's not just a nightmare either. I can feel it. It's hard to breathe when it's around, this thing, it's like a spider and a human mixed together. It has tentacles, reaching out to grab me. I can't escape it, I can't move.

It knows...\n\nThe torture tools came out of nowhere. A scalpel, lighter and pliers.\n\nIt grinned so wide I thought the grin would wrap around its face. Then, he picked up the scalpel. He cut into my skin, scoring perfectly straight lines into my epidermis. It burned like fire, as he smiled and kept going. My skin was now divided into bloody strips. Using the pliers it grabbed my fingernail, and yanked it. Pain shot up my arm and I let out a yell. I begged it to stop, pleading for it to just let me go! It grinned at me and grabbed another fingernail.\n\nYank.\n\nMy fingers were reduced to bleeding stumps. What else was it going to do to me? That was what I asked it. And that was the biggest mistake of my life. Its head turned to look me in the eyes. Its many eyes and a grin with blood dripping from its teeth.\n\nAnd now, I was lying on firewood as he picked up a lighter with his slender, black, fingers, and lit it. He touched the flame to the firewood, and all I could see and hear were flickering flames. My skin was charred black and I was on the brink of death. Death.

It was this whole rhyming incantation which was both beautiful and, you know, terrifying. At the end, we needed a blood sacrifice to seal the deal or let *them* know we were serious. When it came time to give the blood, Yolanda and the other girls suddenly had second thoughts. I didn't actually believe any of it, so I was just a little annoyed at them chickening out, you know? We argued a little and then the other girls left me to clean up because I am the newest member of the coven. I was really annoyed about that so I thought I would show them that it was all made up.

This show is unique and it's basically called 'how long can you last in an abusive relationship?' And you literally have to be in a relationship with someone crazy. The show will set you up with someone crazy and you will have to be in a relationship with them for as long as possible. I thought I could do it but I had to get out. The show set me up with a woman who was whacked out and she was proud of her abusive ways. The cameras followed us everywhere. \n\nIt was instant with her and she enjoyed flirting and watching erotic films with her parents present. It was so awkward and I could tell that her parents were uncomfortable as well, I could see shame in their eyes for failing their daughter. I said I needed to go to the toilet and asked this woman where the toilet was. This was just a ploy to get us both out of the living room, and I told her how I didn't find it comfortable with her flirting with me, with her parents being present. \n\nThen she started shouting and physically punching me because she can't flirt without her parents being present, and all I was thinking was about the money. She went outside and into her car, and she screamed at me to get in. She kept saying stuff to me and calling me names but I kept my head cool. Then randomly she changed the subject to her boss. \n\nShe thought that her boss had hired new employees, but they were useless. She then figured out that her employer never hired anyone new and that she was just imagining them. Her employers relied on her hallucinatory crazy mind to imagine new workers, so that they didn't have to spend money to hire new workers, she thought the new hires were useless when nothing got done, when in reality they never existed. \n\nThen in the middle of the night, she started screaming at me and demanding that I divorce and take all her money and spend it on dead people and improve dead people's economy. I kind of lost it myself and I wanted to give her a taste of her own medicine. \n\nI randomly started shouting at her to falsely accuse me of things. She had no idea what to accuse me of and then her imaginary mind started making up many false accusations about me. Then she got stressed and started to panic when she couldn't think of anything else to accuse me of. Then it was just silence.\n\nThen a producer told me, a woman who entered the show had to be in a relationship with a physically abusive man, she got killed.

In Sloane's experience, ghosts were rarely cooperative, but she learned long ago that they tended to be more helpful after an offering. It was this sort of expertise that convinced the police chief to seek her assistance with a cold case. A murder.\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t go around tellin\u2019 everyone what\u2026 well, you know.

It hadn\u2019t snowed for days, yet hers were the only footprints around. After what happened here, no parent wanted their child anywhere near the place.\n\nSloane sat down on one of the swings, the chains squealing as they pulled taut with her weight. She winced. Against the muffled stillness of that quiet, snow-laden night, it sounded... violent, almost.\n\nThe kids had given other instructions. *Make sure to close your eyes, too,* they\u2019d said. *Otherwise Billy won\u2019t come.

I understand it\u2019s your favorite one.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, noise. Light footsteps crunching over the snow. The chains of the next swing creaking back and forth. \n\nSloane knew she had Billy\u2019s attention, now. \u201cListen\u2026 I know someone did bad things to you. They\u2019re hurting others, too. Kids, like you. I want to stop them and I think you can help me, Billy. Help me so this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else ever again.\u201d She gave superman a toss, heard it land in the snow. \u201cYou can be a hero too, Billy. I just need a name.\u201d\n\nThe swinging stopped, followed with a scraping sound nearby. Then, silence. No footsteps, nothing. Just the cold February wind shushing the trees.\n\nSloane opened her eyes. Superman was gone, but in its place was a name, carved into the snow. \n\n\u201cThank you Billy,\u201d she whispered, before walking away.\n\nAt the edge of the park, Sloane cast one last glance back towards the playground.

With nothing to gauge it's impossible to know if a second has passed or a decade. What I do remember is sitting on a hospital bed, a team of doctors trying hard to resuscitate me after my accident. I can recall through my barely conscious eyes seeing my husband screaming to get past the line of doctors and shouting that our kids were alright. I think that was my cue that I could pass on because from there my eyes closed and never opened. My hearing was already badly muffled from the crash but I distinctly recall the easing away of the sounds from the room. A very smooth transition down to a faint hum and the sounds of my internals operating as I grew a closeness with my body I'd never known before. I got to hear my very last heart beat as the vibration reverberated through my lifeless body. From there the blood toned blackness of bright hospital lights through closed eyelids quickly transformed to a true darkness.\n\nI wasn't ready to go of course.

He\u2019ll have to accompany the reaper into the dark. It\u2019s unfortunate, but it can\u2019t be helped. The rules are the rules.\n\nThe man is trembling with fear, but something in him is stronger than you might assume, and he decides that rather than live his last moments in terror, he\u2019s going to enjoy them as much as he can.\n\nTogether, they watch through the rest of the predictable plot: the man is caught in his lie and almost loses the girl. Finally, he saves her vineyard and wins back her heart.

The credits haven\u2019t finished rolling after all. \n\nAnd so they rewind to the beginning and watch the same boring movie for a second time, and then a third, and a fourth. And now, every time it seems better, richer.

He sees that all along, every moment was infused with the same radiance as this ridiculous garbage, that everything he\u2019s seen and experienced was as miraculous as this paint by numbers film so formulaic it could have been written by an AI. \n\nUntil finally, as the credits roll, he turns to the reaper and whispers, \u201cthat\u2019s enough,\u201d and they disappear into the dark.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676092084.0,"comments":[{"author":"RazorBaribal","text":"r\/wholesomenosleep","upvotes":45,"created_utc":1676118255.0},{"author":"scarymaxx","text":"Thanks for reading!

We can request Dr. Hart to come in instead, the bastard anyway hasn\u2019t gotten anything better to do.\u2019 \n\nFor a second I stared back at Eric, a detective and dear friend of mine, contemplating the best possible answer, but ultimately shook my head. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\nHe furrowed his brow in compassion and it wasn\u2019t hard to understand why. \n\nFor you see, this wasn\u2019t the first time I had seen Alice. I had barely had a full conversation with her, but living in the same neighbourhood my husband and I had seen her pass by often, riding her bike with a brightening smile gracing her face. \n\n\u2018Only 15 huh,\u2019 Eric muttered with a hint of anger. \u2018That\u2019s the youngest till now\u2026 If we ever find the sick animal responsible for this, I\u2019m going to make sure he suffers.\u2019 \n\nHe sighed and looked down on her a last time, making his way to our morgue\u2019s exit. \u2018Come find me when you\u2019ve got your report finished, though I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t be any different from the last ones.\u2019 \n\nAnd with that final note, he disappeared.

It's a place where the wicked thrive and the curious are never heard from again. This place is called the Dark Web, and it's a labyrinth of terrors and nightmares.\n\nIt all started when a group of friends, who loved exploring the unknown, decided to delve into the Dark Web. They had heard rumors of a website that offered real-life horrors, and they were eager to see it for themselves.\n\nThey stumbled upon a site called \"The Abyss,\" which promised to show them the darker side of the internet. The site's layout was simple and eerie, with a black background and glowing red text. The friends were fascinated, and they decided to explore the site further.\n\nAs they clicked on various links, they found themselves immersed in a world of violence and terror. They saw videos of brutal crimes and photographs of murdered victims. They read stories of people who had disappeared without a trace after visiting the Dark Web.\n\nThe friends soon realized that they were in over their heads. They tried to leave the site, but the pages wouldn't close. They were trapped in The Abyss, and the more they tried to leave, the more the site seemed to pull them in.\n\nIt wasn't long before they started to experience strange things. They heard whispers in the darkness, and felt cold breaths on the back of their necks. They saw visions of grotesque creatures lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe friends were terrified, and they began to panic. They screamed for help, but no one answered. They were alone in the Dark Web, and they knew that they would never escape.\n\nAs they sat huddled together, they heard a voice. It was a deep, raspy voice that whispered, \"You should never have come here. You are now mine.\" The friends screamed in terror as they felt something grab them from the darkness.\n\nThey were never seen or heard from again.\n\nYears later, a young hacker discovered the remains of The Abyss on the Dark Web. As he explored the site, he too began to experience strange and terrifying things. He heard whispers in the darkness, and felt cold breaths on the back of his neck.\n\nThe hacker soon realized that he was not alone in the Dark Web. Something was watching him, something that was waiting to claim him as its next victim.\n\nThe hacker's screams echoed through the Dark Web, and to this day, no one knows what happened to him. Some say that he was taken by the monster of the Dark Web, and that he now haunts the site, waiting to claim its next victim.\n\nThe Dark Web is a place of mystery and terror, and it's a warning to all those who dare to explore it. Those who enter the Dark Web never return, and they become a part of its darkness forever. Who knows? Maybe you will be next.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676152895.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Oh...","author":"A_lexicon_disaster","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10zk3ir\/oh\/","text":"Oh\u2026 what is this?

One by one, my next wife, my other kids all dropped like flies.\n\nThat was the least of my problems.  \n\nThough I had an intense healing factor, it could not stop cancer from growing.  The bulging burls would continue bubbling and knotting nonstop, forming in bundles like grapes made of flesh and blood.  Whenever doctors removed them, they would come back, fighting with more vigor than before.  Even though I was like a living corpse, requiring no oxygen or nutrients, they still persisted not unlike a bad itch.\n\nThe sun eventually formed a red giant, swallowing up the earth faster than Pacman with a power pellet.  As I laid on a spaceship, heading towards another star, the tumors had completely consumed my back, paralyzing me in a prison of my own rogue tissue.  It was a miracle that I was able to finally get them removed somewhat from my spine.  They would always come back, but eliminating them entirely was futile.\n\nThat star developed into a red giant, followed by a white dwarf, followed by nothing.  I would hop from planet to planet, developing new friends and establishing new families that would all crumble before my eyes.\n\nThen, the last black hole in the universe was vanishing, yet I was still here, on the ruins of a blank rock world, trying to cry, only for my tears to freeze in the absolute zero temperature.

After spending an eternity experiencing the universe, I\u2019d gained an eternity of knowledge as well.  Soon, I learned to create materials that would last forever, too.  Then came artificial intelligence that mimicked human brains perfectly.  Instead of waiting for friends to come, I would make them in the form of humanoid robots.

I had confused feelings at first but I kind of enjoyed being a new cool slang term for something amazing. It made me feel like I was part of the world. \n\nI remember when a famous singer came to visit my area, at a concert. When the singer stepped outside to sign stuff, all the kids kept saying how the singer was \"so headless Timmy\" and how the singers clothes were \"so headless Timmy\" and I was a bit chuffed actually. I was enjoying being part of thier language. The term \"that so headless timmy\" didn't just mean cool, but also weird. When they saw a wall with weird art on thier, all the teenagers started saying \"that's so headless timmy\" and I was beginning to now love it. My name was part of the cool kids vocabulary. \n\nThere were videos of kids saying \"that's so headless timmy\" to awesome and strange things. My friend also wanted his name to be part of the young kids slang term for something. My friends name was Craig and one day he got up, and when he went outside he heard all the Kids say \"that's so legless craig\" to a dirty dustbin. As Craig started his name more in slang term, he figured out the meaning of \"that's so legless craig\" and it meant disgusting and horrible. Craig was depressed because both our names are not part of the young people's slang term. Although mine was positive and Craig wasn't. \n\nI told Craig that he should be patient and that youths are constantly changing words. Craig was so depressed and I could hear teenagers outside shouting \"that's so headless timmy\" to thier new clothes. Then one teenager shouted out \"that's so legless craig\" as the teenager didn't like another person's clothing. Inside I shamefully liked this and it made me feel good and I wanted more. I was almost competing with Craig but Craig didn't know it. I wanted more. \n\nThen one day I was surrounded by teenage youths and they kept shouting \"that's so headless timmy\" and they asked me whether I wanted to be headless.

About seventy percent of Earth\u2019s surface is covered by vast oceans, and the remaining thirty percent is dry land, much of it suitable for the afore-mentioned inhabitants to inhabit.\n\nThe land is divided into a variety of continents, and one of those continents is known as North America. One of the countries in North America is known as the United States of America, the name having been derived from the fact that it is situated in North America and that it is made up of a variety of states. Clever. One of the states along the southern border of the United States is known as Texas, and Texas is home to a myriad of cities and towns spread far and wide across its plentiful lands.\n\nThe most populous city in Texas is called Houston, and Houston is home to millions of people who originated from all over Earth, though primarily from the Americas at large. Quite the melting pot, Houston is. In the final analysis, Houston is just one of many great American cities where millions and millions of Americans reside.\n\nOne of the many neighborhoods in Houston is called the New Montrose, and it\u2019s a fine place to live. Of course, back in the day one could scrounge up any manner of debauchery known to man in the Montrose area, but that\u2019s another story. In this story, the Montrose is a relatively wholesome place to live\u2014so long as you don\u2019t dig too deep.\n\nOne of the residents of New Montrose is a male of the species who goes by the name of Sebastian. Sebastian stays in a nice little space in a high-rise filled with condominiums\u2014forty-seven stories worth, to be precise\u2014and his unit is on floor forty-five. Many a lonely night he\u2019d ascended to the roof of his building to take in the view of the Houston skyline\u2014as he\u2019d just done on this night.\n\nSebastian was covered with human skin, and inside his body were the usual muscles and bones and organs. One of those organs was a heart, a heart that had many more beats left in it than the number it had yet expended, but that wasn\u2019t the thing. The *thing*, as it were, was that inside Sebastian\u2019s heart\u2014deep down and dug in tight\u2014dwelled a demon.\n\nSebastian had been reared well, had gone to Catholic school and had heeded what the nuns had taught him, but the demon had been strong\u2014even back then. It was the demon that\u2019d kept him from the light, and it was the demon that\u2019d made Sebastian do those terrible things to all those children.\n\nSebastian\u2019s last thought as he stepped off the edge of his building was whether he or the demon had made this last decision. Chances were good he\u2019d never know.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676099835.0,"comments":[{"author":"Sprattus_Sprattus","text":"I need to announce that I just decided to call these types of stories the \"microscope focusing stories\", and I absolutely love them.

Inside, a group of friends huddled together for warmth and comfort, telling ghost stories to pass the time. They thought it would be a fun adventure, spending the night in the creepy, dilapidated mansion that was said to be haunted.\n\nBut as the night wore on, strange things began to happen. Doors creaked open and slammed shut on their own. Shadows moved across the walls when there was no one there. And worst of all, they heard strange whispers coming from the darkness. The friends tried to brush it off as their imagination playing tricks on them, but as the night went on, the disturbances became more and more frequent and intense.\n\nThen, one by one, they started to disappear. At first, they thought it was just a joke, but as the night went on and more and more of their friends vanished, they realized they were in grave danger. They searched the house from top to bottom, but the missing friends were nowhere to be found.\n\nDesperate and afraid, the remaining friends huddled together in the attic, the one place they thought would be safe. But as the night grew later and the storm outside raged on, they heard a creaking on the stairs, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps. They held their breaths, trying not to make a sound, but it was too late. The door to the attic was thrown open, and a figure stood in the doorway, shrouded in darkness.\n\nThe friends screamed in terror as the figure stepped forward into the light, revealing a ghostly apparition with glowing eyes and a sinister smile. It floated toward them, its arms outstretched as if it were reaching for them.\n\nJust as they thought all was lost, the storm suddenly stopped, and the ghostly figure vanished into thin air. The friends breathed a sigh of relief, but their terror was far from over. As they made their way down the stairs, they noticed that the walls and floors were covered in strange symbols and writing that they had never seen before.\n\nAs they made their way outside, they were greeted by an even more horrifying sight. Their missing friends were there, standing in a circle around the house. But their eyes were blank and staring, and their bodies were contorted in unnatural positions. The friends realized, too late, that they had stumbled into a haunted house where the spirits of the dead were trapped and forced to haunt the place for eternity.\n\nTerrified and heartbroken, the friends stumbled away from the house and into the night, never looking back. They never spoke of that fateful night again, but the memory of the ghostly apparition and the haunted house stayed with them forever.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676115555.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Soul's Oasis","author":"SkittishReflections","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10z897c\/souls_oasis\/","text":"\u201cGrandpa, Tristan's a con man.\u201d\n\n\"He's not.

Anyway, without it, it made him seemed that he was \"smiling\" at you with the cutest set of eyes. That cat was always pouncing on something. Bugs. Mice.\n\nHope was the most relaxed of the two, cuddling up with me on the bed, listening patiently to my imagination, stories that helped me cope with my baby sister's fate.\n\nMama and Papa had always been silent whenever I asked about her. Granny had to tell me it had to tell me it was an accident, that she fell asleep and never woke up. \n\nThe next thing to happen was that  my sister's room was left untouched, and that I wasn't allowed to enter. \n\nSo to cope, I came up with stories where she and me would play and laugh and go to school and shop together in our own little kingdom. A place of happiness and hope. And thanks to my cats, I could tell them so. \n\nOne night, I had a dream in which my sister went missing. I searched and searched but found nothing. I ended up crying. Hope, one of the cats, climbed up the bed and comforted me, while Happy clawed at the bedroom door. Then silence. \n\nBoth cats faced the door. \n\nHope and Happy heard it. I listened.\n\nThen I heard it too. \n\n*Small beats*.\n\nI was too young at that time to know it was *heartbeats*. \n\nBut I heard it, and followed my cats towards the baby's room.

Nearly there.\n\nHe rose and assessed the damage. Right arm was useless. Down to one leg. He reached up to his head remembering his ear. It was a pulpy mess but not very bloody. Time was almost up. \n\nMore gunshots and shouting from behind him. \n\nONE DOWN! ANOTHER\u2019S GOING FOR THE BRIDGE! HURRY!\n\nHe limped up to the gate and pushed through toward the bridge over the town's reservoir. The other ones should have been there by now. Bullets whistled past all around him. Another volley tore through his back and ate the concrete walkway in front of him. This was bad. It was over for him. But maybe they could still make it, he thought.\n\nWith his one good arm, he dragged himself the remaining few feet to the edge over the water.  He could feel his skin and innards rippling like a wave, through his chest up to his head. His last sight was a reflection of himself on the placid surface, a strained smile over his reddened face and bulbous eyes just before thousands of worms burst forth in a mad race to the freshwater to spawn.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676071908.0,"comments":[{"author":"FluffyHeartHorse","text":"Ew.

Getting hard to remember details after so long.\u00a0\n\n\nThen, when I first came with Mom, it was pristine and beautiful. Carefully manicured and maintained while staying in balance with the local ecosystem. While all that was nice all my 6 year old brain could see was the amazing playground, with its towers and ropewalks and slides and rockwalls. I can\u2019t say how long we stayed that first time (long enough I got a nasty sunburn), but it was also the day I met Jason.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was around my age and it was instant brotherhood. We played pirates on the rope bridges and exploring climbers as we went up the wall. I asked him where he went to school and I didn\u2019t recognize the name which made me sad because we would see each other after the summer was over. He said not to worry, we could meet on the weekends and I was so happy! I would bring toys and sports equipment for us to play with because my family was well off. There were times I even gave some to Jason because I could.\n\n\nOver the years he and I grew up, but never grew apart. When I got my first phone, I tried to get his number but he went quiet and seemed embarrassed. I thought it was just because he was poor. Elementary school came and went in the blink of an eye and before long I was a senior in High School looking at going away to college. For as much changed in my life, Jason was always there waiting at this playground to meet up.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, not just I have changed but the world as well. Standing here I look where the park was and make my way to the playground or what is left of it. Charred and warped metal is all that remains, and the howling wind the only sound. Taking a single step where the soft mat was I look up and Jason\u2019s there, a sad smile on his face looking just how I remembered him.\n\n\nReturning his smile I remove the protective helmet. Instantly my lungs begin to burn and my vision fades, but Jason remains clear.

There\u2019s white as snow feathers failing miserably at covering a mangey, pale-gray body. That\u2019s the closest my mind can come to comprehending the monstrosity. I\u2019ve never seen it, but I have seen its handiwork. The corpses decapitated. The limbs strewn across the courtyard. The foot long feathers left among the dead, buried like someone\u2019s demented version of a treasure hunt. When people ask what it is, my only response is, \u201cIt\u2019s That Which Remains Unseen.\u201d \n\n  \n I think it changes shape for each person. I picture it a certain way, but others describe it as different. I can\u2019t tell you who\u2019s the most accurate. All I can tell you is that it remains unseen. That\u2019s the nature of it. The moment it is seen is the moment it no longer holds power over us. After all, seeing is the beginning of knowing and knowing is the beginning of understanding. And when something is understood shortly later it no longer holds us paralyzed by fear. We develop methods to combat it. Ways to defend ourselves. \n\n  \n The thing that frightens me most is that I have no control when it will come for me. I eat. I breathe. I sleep. I live my life day in day out and there is nothing I can do. I\u2019m powerless to it. I\u2019m forced to see every day as my last. Cause it very well could be. The beak. The tentacles. Those roughhewn feathers brushing against my face. It could all be over before I even knew it was there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat a way to live. \n\n  \n All I can tell you is this:\u00a0 \n\n  \n The only way to win is to live in the moment.

In fact, I\u2019m more than willing to try those kinds of dishes. \n\nWhile traversing Europe, I met this eccentric chef. I noticed him cause he was cute but more importantly, he was famous for the cooking the weirdest dishes. His food is a hit or miss but what makes him popular was his knack for experimenting. He once cooked animal fur and somehow it ended up tasting really good, according to critics. I was really eager to talk to him so I mustered up the courage. \n\n2 years later, he\u2019s cooking for me at my house. I can\u2019t tell anyone enough how happy I\u2019ve been.

There\u2019s just something about the way he cooks. Not just that but so far, all his dishes have been a hit to me. He said he was nervous to do this cause it was his first time cooking this kind of dish but he\u2019s doing so good. I applaud him for it. \n\nIt has been a long night so far and the special dinner is soon coming to an end. I\u2019m particularly excited about the last dish, although there is a few more.

I and three other friends were attacked while camping by a secluded lake \u2014 only I survived. I didn\u2019t realize it then, but I\u2019d been infected with a curse. It wasn't until the first full moon that I understood the extent of the changes.\n\nUnable to return to my previous life, I was adopted by a pack of vagrant werewolves living on the fringes of society. They were conniving, ruthless, and unforgiving \u2014 but they looked after their own. Even if I didn't like them, there was no other place to call home. Eventually, I fell into the new routines of life: eat, sleep, howl, repeat.\n\nI\u2019d been a practicing vegan for seven years before my transformation. The others were horrified to discover I didn\u2019t consume anything derived from animal products, meat or otherwise. It was seen as unnatural and a break from tradition. Our kind had subsisted on the creatures of the forest for eons, I was breaking a chain that extended back for untold generations. Despite their disapproval, they remained loyal to me.\n\nOn many occasions, I tried cooking vegan meals for the pack. This never went over well and my food went untouched. My cooking might as well have been poison. The pack craved the flesh and bone of animals and nothing more.\n\nWhen the full moon came we\u2019d gather in the woods. One by one our bodies would sprout tufts of thick hair, hands curve into menacing claws, and teeth elongate and sharpen into salivating fangs. Together we\u2019d howl into the night, preparing for what was to come.\n\nI had no problem joining in the hunt. In fact, the others would say I was the most violent and bloodthirsty of them all. I\u2019d eviscerate anyone unlucky enough to cross my path. Through the years I left behind a pile of bodies that would rival even the most murderous cartels. By the night's end, my teeth would be stained with blood and my belly full. While the rest of the pack focused exclusively on the animals or the forest, I had a different prey in mind.\n\nNow you may be asking yourself, \u201cbut I thought you were a vegan.\u201d Well, I am \u2014 in the strictest of senses. Vegans don\u2019t eat animals or their byproducts, but humans left the natural world behind long ago.

I didn\u2019t have anything better to do\u2014*obviously*\u2014so I pulled into the drive.\n\nI walked up onto the rickety front porch, floorboards complaining under my shoes, and made my way to the front door. The door\u2019s glass window had been filthy in appearance as I\u2019d approached, but as I cupped my hands around my eyes and peered in, it became perfectly clean. That was disconcerting, but what I saw through the glass was outright astounding. In the front room sat my long-since departed mother and father, and in the floor at their feet lay me and my twin brother. From the bluish light on our faces, I could tell we were all watching something on television.\n\nI must\u2019ve forgotten my manners, because I didn\u2019t even knock\u2014I flung the door open and went inside. No one seemed to notice. I went to my mother and threw my arms around her and began to sob, but soon it occurred to me that she hadn\u2019t hugged me back. It was though I was a ghost, one she couldn\u2019t see or feel.\n\nI tried shaking her by the shoulders\u2014no response. I tried to get my father\u2019s attention and got the same result.

It was as though I\u2019d been singled out for punishment in the cruelest of ways\u2014being given my family back only to have them totally ignore me.\n\nI wailed inconsolably, then I finally staggered back out onto the front porch and had myself a long cry. All the memories, the regrets, the unfairness of it all. It was almost more than I could take. I decided, by God, I was going to *make* them see me, so I turned to go back in\u2014but the light was gone. Panicked, I peered through the filthy glass into the front room, and there was nothing to be seen\u2014just an empty, cobweb-filled space.\n\nThoroughly crestfallen, I trudged back to my car, then drove home, wiping at my eyes constantly so I could see the road. I considered just letting the car run as I parked in the garage, but decided against it. Nothing to be gained by dying.\n\nI needed to talk to someone, though\u2014my wife would have to do. I went down to the basement, removed the floorboards from the back closet and pulled up her box. I emoted my story to her, sparing no detail\u2014and just like when she\u2019d been alive, I got no response. *Self-centered bitch*.\n\nWish I\u2019d known about mummification back when I\u2019d extinguished my family.

Inside the crater, roughly twenty feet down was a metal capsule that was mostly spherical in shape. \n\n9:13 p.m. The deputies are ordered to stand by and await further instructions.\n\n9:17 p.m. Timms noted that the capsule appeared to be a relic of the Soviet Union from the 1960\u2019s. A faded red star was on the side of the craft along with several instances of Russian cyrillic.\n\nHe noted that the capsule was covered in some kind of organic growth that appeared to be of a strange origin and material that he was unfamiliar with. He remarked that it appeared to be a kind of tendril-like fungus. He also noted a large porthole on one side of the craft. He reported that it was open, but he was not able to see inside the craft unless he were to climb down into the crater.\n\n9:20 p.m. Deputies Timms and Whitaker were advised to cordon off the area and await further instructions. Timms acknowledged in the affirmative.\n\n9:22 Timms advised of strange sounds coming from inside the craft. A kind of language.\n\n9:23 Timms advised command that a deformed dog began to crawl out of the craft.

The eyes were a milky white and the jaw seemed dislocated and hanging open revealing only four long teeth. Two on the top of the jaw and two on the bottom jaw. Timms said that it was staring at them.\n\n9:26 An unintelligible communication comes from Timms that is further compromised by the sound of multiple gunshots.\n\nFor over thirty minutes, several attempts were made by command to contact the deputies by radio, but there was no answer.\n\n9:57 p.m. Deputy Whitaker frantically asks for back up. Informs base that Deputy Timms is dead, and that he is running back to the cruiser. \n\nFifteen minutes later, several State Troopers arrived at the scene. Deputy Whitaker\u2019s body was found disemboweled in the cruiser.

Not enough American dream to go around, I guess, so I worked construction with my engineering degree and the guys all joked about it. They liked me, though, and the more they liked me, the better the money got until I threw my back out. It never healed right. \n\nThe apartment had mold: ceiling fell in, walls crumbled, the works. We moved. Pipes burst. Stove died. Rent raised.\n\nMy wife picked at scrambled eggs and grilled cheese with Kraft singles. Always a little hungry, never quite full.\n\nI almost felt relieved when my dad up and died. No hospice expenses, no retirement. After that came the guilt and grief, funeral expenses, numbness, slow recovery and the constant reminder that you never really heal.\n\nShe didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant until two months in. \n\nI know. I know what it looks like for parents to struggle. For kids to see it. I know.\n\nBut I\u2019d lost my dad. Her mom had relapsed so many damn times and had stopped asking about grandkids, the absolute saint, but there was this longing and this time limit. That little hourglass of death.\n\nAnd I wanted it desperately.\n\nGod, it was worth it. I wouldn\u2019t trade my daughter for anything. I would do it all over again: coffee and ramen and roofing in the summer heat, the death of a parent, the uncertainty. I would do it all over again for the same result.\n\nMy daughter the most wondrous thing I\u2019ve seen. The most precious thing I could hold. Little mouth open for a spoonful of peas; hands tearing bread into little pieces to make it last longer.\n\nI love her more than anything. But I am so, so terrified that I will never see her full.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675928514.0,"comments":[{"author":"7D03","text":"This makes me want to cry.

It's completely bizarre and I will be honest, that i am finding it all amusing. I mean a werewolf and there haven't been anything caught on video footage or CCTV cameras. Ok some people claim to have caught something on thier phone, but the footage is messy and dark, and not very clear. It's just looks like a wild animal. People have been finding dead bodies that have been mauled to death, which just leads me to think that people need to control thier dogs, or just some other wild animal is running loose in the village. \n\nSo many people keep talking about the werewolf and they believe it so very much. People have claimed to have seen the werewolf but I haven't seen a shred of pure clear evidence. I mean this werewolf thing has learly gripped the whole village in such a way, that it's making the village a dead one. Apparently the werewolf is intelligent and it knows where the CCTV cameras are, and it only comes out at night, in places like forests. This just makes me believe that it is just some sadistic person setting loose his crazy animal, on actual people. \n\nAnyhow I don't feel really afraid and I haven't seen anything and I have been sleeping well at night. This werewolf has certainly not been living rent free in my head. I am sympathetic to those who have lost thier lives to this crazy animal or even person, but to think a werewolf is involved is just lunacy. I mean this is clear cut mass hysteria where fear just spreads among the people like a disease. Someone should definitely should study the people in my village, it would make an interesting read for proffessors of psychology, sociology and psychiatry. \n\nThen one day everyone in my village received a letter. On this letter it basically asked whether we believe in this werewolf, there was a yes or a no answer to tick. I ticked no obviously and then I get a knock on the door. It was a large group of men in protective clothing and they had guns with them. They then quickly made a basic cage for me. They told me that I was the only person in the village who didn't believe in the werewolf. \n\nI had to be in the cage and I surprisingly slept really well, and when I awoke, they showed me video footage of me turning into a werewolf. My clothes magically blended in with the werewolf and when I turned back to normal, my clothes were normal. \n\nAhh the reason I haven't seen or heard the werewolf, is because I am the werewolf. The werewolf has a good mind of its own and it knew it was in a cage and so it didn't bother fighting. The werewolf did a good job in making sure that I never realised that I was the werewolf.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1676030670.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"My friend wrote this and was wondering if anyone else likes his writing.","author":"TwoWritersOneAccount","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10z0tyu\/my_friend_wrote_this_and_was_wondering_if_anyone\/","text":"    I woke with a start on one Saturday evening. It had been a nightmare like no other \u2014 A boy had emerged from the woods, and urged me to follow him in his returnal. He was the wind and the shadow. Trees parted in his wake. He was barely distinguishable from the shadows besides his silk color. He seemed to melt into the woods. I began to learn his movements, and my pace matched his. It was splendid . . . until we made it to his destination.\n    A graveyard . . . no, a memorial. There, placed in the ground, were markers. They were crude, and were held together by rope. The boy came to rest in front of a particularly new one. It looked grand: flowers decorated it, the wood was sanded to perfection, and it had a glow as well, it was unexplainable. The boy, on his knees, began to weep. I went up to comfort him, but a gust of wind forces me back. It blew me away. I went into the sky and saw the stars. The sun was rising on an infinite horizon. The days went by, an infinite cycle. Millenia. I looked down where the boy sat. As the days progressed, he grew. A man, to an elder, a king, and then . . . a child again. But this child stood in front of a different grave. Had it been moved? The cycle repeat. I was like a god. I saw the lives of so many, yet lacked the sense to feel empathy for them. If I raised my arm, I could see fire and destruction in the distant lands. A blink, and a day was passed. I noticed that the boy who had as well  become a man had started to come less and less. Eventually, he was gone. The grove to the east over grew the burial, and in the distance I had begun to see towers rise. This place was gone.\n    The world started to become grey. I could no longer see wind nor shadow flow though out the woods. It was lost. A city was built over the grave, and over the city was a strange sky of pillars and fine mansions. It was all grey. Heaven by humans, perhaps? Unfortunately, it was empty. How lonely it felt with this power. I bet the gods felt unfulfilled, I understand now: That boy was a god. He decided to become human. He lived, and as his ancestors lived and died, they too ascended as he once had until it all blurred. The world, the wild, the wind\u2026 it was gone. The shadow now lay as a reminder. It is as if they were only there to lose themselves. Lose the world, and lose what had been a true life for a half life.

She woke up, got ready, ate breakfast, then was off to school. Her younger brother Mike would be staying home today for a doctor\u2019s appointment but her parents decided on going out afterwards with him and coming home before Briana got out. \n\r\nSix and a half hours passed and Briana was dropped off on her street by the bus. Headphones in each ear as she made her way home. After a short walk, she entered through the side door that led to the kitchen. There she found her mom washing dishes. Briana gave her a hug from behind, adding a little squeeze at the end for good measure, then made her way to the stairs.\n\r\nAs she got to the foot of the stairs she noticed that Lilo, their dog, didn\u2019t greet her like she normally would, but then figured she was with Mike. Making her way up to her room, she placed her hand through the railing, the couch rested against it, giving perfect access to whoever sat there. She was able to tussle her dad\u2019s hair a good amount while he was watching the news.\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs were her and Mike\u2019s room, opposite from each other. She glanced over at her brother as he sat with his head down practicing his guitar. She made a joke that even with music playing in her ear, she could tell he was playing badly. Finally in her room, she sat at her desk right away, wanting to wrap up her homework fast since it was pretty straight forward. After a few minutes she felt a tug at her pants leg, Lilo had finally shown herself. \n\r\nIt seemed like Lilo was in her room the entire time since the door remained in its cracked state. She seemed scared to Briana, which wasn't a common occurrence. Briana took off her headphones to concentrate on Lilo, then that's when she heard it. Doors closing on a car, she got up and looked out her window. In their driveway was the family car and leaving it was her parents and brother.\n\r\nBriana stared in disbelief, trying to process what exactly was going on, but it was already too late. Lilo retreated to underneath the bed when she alone noticed what stood in the now open doorway. Three figures, figures that seemed almost identical to her family in every way, but they lacked any distinguishable features at a quick glance. If you were to look at them closely, you'd see that there were no features at all, a blank canvas where their faces should be.\n\r\nBriana faced out the window looking down at her family. Sensing something behind her, she tried screaming for help, but no sound was made. In an alarmed state, she quickly turned to face the door but saw nothing but black. Briana did nothing wrong but she had acknowledged them, accepted them, and now she belonged with them.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675997412.0,"comments":[{"author":"Mother-Lavishness802","text":"Love this!","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676028274.0},{"author":"Brianfailz","text":"So creepy!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676047030.0},{"author":"Lovingbutdifferent","text":"Welp, this scared the shit out of me","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676065837.0},{"author":"REDpandaBEAR1987","text":"I feel like you should have made it more obvious that her parents and brother were just getting home, not getting in the car to leave, but out of the car to come inside.

Pale and unblemished, not even the finest porcelain china could compare. Then, you'd notice the rigidnes of their features, as if the dips beneath their brows were etched, dim eyes slotted in and noses sculpted.\n\n\nYou'd also notice their lips, stretched into a smile and seemingly held in place by some invisible wire. They'd look soft and welcoming, but you'd find out that they were cold and nothing but.\n\n\n*Have you ever seen how a cone snail eats?*\n\n\nIf I had to compare an angel to another shelled creature, I'd compare it to a cone snail. As beautiful as they are, they are both vicious and deadly. \n\n\nUnlike many snail species, cone snails have a proboscis, or an extended feeding tube. Attached to the tip of proboscis is a modified tooth, packed with enough venom to paralyze and kill their prey. They use this to repeatedly jab their prey when hunting for food.\n\n\nAngels are not much different. When an angel attacks, its perpetual smile turns into a gaping maw within a split second. You'd hear a cacophony of noises\u2014 a simultaneous mix of trumphets, nails scraping against metal and babies' laughter. If you're distracted by the sound, even for just a moment, the angel's fleshy feeding tube would introduce you to a quick death.\n\n\nThat almost happened to me once, but I dodged quickly. Despite he horrid thing barely grazing my cheek, I was in agony for seemed like an eternity.\n\n\nThough, I suppose God decided it was too soon for me to start paying for my sins.\n\n\n*How do you enjoy your snails for dinner?*\n\n\nIn the western world, these delicacies are often slathered in sauces and eaten with forks. While I too enjoy my snails this way, the best experience I've had was in a  Southeast Asian alleyway. The vendor had  boiled the snails in pot while they were still alive. He then scooped them up into a paper cup and handed them to me, motioning for me to suck them out. And so, slurp them out I did, savouring as their juices flowed into my mouth and hijacked my senses.\n\n\nI get the same thrill now. As I pry open the angel's lips with a pair of metal pliers, it weakly struggles against its chains. Despite the numerous beatings it had taken, its hard skin shows no sign of bruises or injuries. Nevertheless, it's too weak to attack now. \n\n\nLike snails, angels are soft on the inside. I hold a kettle and begin pouring its contents the angel's mouth. \n\n\nAs it thrashes, its wails play a tune that's music to my ears\u2014 church bells, funeral marches and the loud crackle of flames.\n\n\nWhen the angel stops writhing, I gently press my lips against its.\n\n\n*I begin to suck.*\n\n\n*Bon App\u00e9tit.*","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675956536.0,"comments":[{"author":"snarkisms","text":"okay I LOVED this.

The light of his computer filled the entire room illuminating his bed and floor. There were quite a few wrappers from snacks littered across the floor and a puddle of soda soaking into his sock under the desk. It was about 11:00PM and caffeine was flowing in his tired body. Trying to write something new challenging. Plenty of ideas made their way onto his screen, but very few made it onto the web as most were left into his trash can. His computer was getting slow as of late due to the few gigabytes worth of pdfs deleted but never wiped from his computer. \n\nHe had made a deal a while ago with some abnormal entity that if didn't have to sleep, he'd be able to write new stories at least once a week. He was an aspiring writer with the single goal of becoming a famous author. What better way to do so than pump out as much content as possible and then celebrate when a story hit 10 likes...on Facebook. The tiny blinking line flickered on and off of his screen every 0.5 seconds as he stared into space trying to pull together whatever concept could get him past the week. He made a bargain and needed to keep his side of it.\n\nHours passed and the sun rose and sunk. How many days has it been? Why are the shadows coming closer? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday were scratched out on his calendar. One hour and he would suffer if he didn't come up with something. The room started shrinking bit by bit as the minutes slowly ticked by. The air turned sour smelling like mold and sweat. \n\n\"I got it! It's..it's about a guy. Yes. He...he has a knife. Good, good. A knife that is possessed by a demon forcing him to murder innocents. I've struck gold!\", he yelled as he started tapping away at his keyboard. The words started flying onto the screen. His clock was getting closer to midnight with every click of his keyboard. He could feel his heartbeat increase every second. The room started getting smaller and smaller. The air was thinning out and he was having a harder time breathing. His vision was slowly degrading and he started feeling immense pain in his chest. \n\n\"I'm almost there, just need a little more time.\", he said losing his voice. The clock started counting down with 3 minutes left. His typing slowed down before stopping entirely. As midnight struck so did something in his chest. \"Time's up.\", a demonic voice called out. Erin closed his eyes feeling nothing but dread as he fell into an abyss. \n\n\"Turns out the kid was taking Adderall every hour and was ingesting high amounts of caffeine as well.

I\u2019m sixteen years old, and I am the sole survivor of The Cold Moon Massacre. \n\nOn the morning of December 8th 2022, I was found in an abandoned warehouse on Deally Street along with what was left of thirty three friends from my high school. We were having a party.\n\nNone of my friends survived, and I was found with multiple abrasions on my face and all of my ribs were broken. They believed that I was beaten with a metal pipe. \n\nThey did find a metal pipe in all that mess. It was found in the hand of Chris Lincoln. My boyfriend.\n\nI told everyone that I had no memory of what happened the night before, and they believed me. The doctors told me that was how the brain worked sometimes. Self preservation mode to deal with all the trauma. I wish mine worked that way, but it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe truth is, I remembered all of it, and I was helpless to stop it. A passenger. I watched all of them scream and beg and plead and die in that broken old warehouse. I see it everytime I try to sleep. My life has become what my father always feared.\n\nMy mother was attacked while she was pregnant with me. I survived, and she didn\u2019t. \n\nMy father made sure that I knew what kind of a woman she was and how happy they were together. He prayed for protection over me every night while I was little, and sometimes when I was older, I would catch him by my bedside on his knees with his head bowed. It was always the same prayer. He was the best man I\u2019ll ever know.\n\nHe passed away two years ago to cancer. Before he died, he told me everything about what happened to my mother. He told me why he prayed over me. He told me that maybe he had worried all these years for nothing. \n\nBut then he gave me something just in case. A  gift. Something he had made when I was a baby, just in case the nightmare ever came true. He cried and told me that he hoped I would never have to use it. There was a time when I thought my father might be crazy, but now I\u2019m sorry that I ever doubted him.\n\nAs I stand on Spivey Point on the evening of January 6th, looking out over the ocean, I\u2019m at peace with the decision I\u2019ve made. I look at my father\u2019s terrible gift in the fading light, and then I load it into his gun and pull the hammer back. It\u2019s almost dark, and the moon is about to come up. It\u2019s time.\n\nI put a note in my pocket so there are no questions as to my wishes. I pray to God that they do as I ask.

Amy felt a pang of guilt as she remembered the wails that came from Becca\u2019s parents a week ago at the Culling Ceremony after Becca\u2019s name was called. The guilt was replaced by relief, which was quickly dashed by anxiety. Mara was only 6 years old and had another two Cullings ahead of her. With any luck they\u2019d dodge The Beast again. Hopefully. \"Mary\" had been the first in their community so many years ago, but she certainly wouldn't be the last.\n\n\nMara waved to Jessica as they left the playground, while Amy went over her to-do list in her head.

But I was wrong. So very wrong.\n\nIt all started when a group of friends and I decided to play with a Ouija board we had found at an antique store. We thought it would be a harmless way to spend the evening, but we quickly realized we had made a grave mistake.\n\nAt first, the board seemed to be working fine. We asked it simple questions, and we were getting answers. But as the night went on, the answers became more sinister and the board began to move on its own.\n\nWe tried to end the game, but we couldn't. The board seemed to have a life of its own, and it was moving faster and faster. The answers it was giving us were filled with darkness and fear, and we were all terrified.\n\nBut the worst was yet to come. One of my friends started to convulse, and she began to speak in a voice that wasn't her own. She was being possessed by the entity that we had summoned through the board.\n\nWe tried to help her, but it was too late. The entity was too powerful, and it had taken control of her completely. We were all paralyzed with fear, and we didn't know what to do.\n\nAs the night wore on, the entity started to reveal its true nature. It told us that it was an ancient evil, and that it had been summoned through the Ouija board. It told us that we were all doomed, and that we would never be able to escape its wrath.\n\nWe tried to run, but it was too late. The entity was too powerful, and it had already taken control of our minds and bodies. We were trapped, and we knew that there was no way out.\n\nThe last thing I remember was being consumed by darkness and fear. The entity had claimed us, and we were lost to its power.\n\nI don't know how long I was trapped, but when I finally came to, I was alone in the room. My friends were gone, and the Ouija board was nowhere to be found.\n\nBut I knew what had happened. The entity had claimed them, and they were lost to its power. I was the only one who had escaped, but I knew that I would never be able to forget the terror of that night.\n\nI have never touched a Ouija board since, and I will never forget the lessons I learned that night.

Getting pretty sick of everyone telling me that this is a \u201csecond chance\u201d. I committed a little mail-fraud, that\u2019s all. I just wanted a little break, OK??! Moved into a small cottage here, on his vast estate; The Lord of the Manor takes most of my wages as rent.  Met him briefly. He\u2019s as you\u2019d expect; an arrogant old posh snobby arsehole. Lives alone, widowed, that\u2019s all I know.\n\n\nJan 27th\nF**k this job, he can stick it up his noble arse. So tired, can barely hold my pen.\n\nJan 28th\nAlmost quit today. Fingers bleed from every joint, Wrists torn to ribbons from thorns and brambles. He won\u2019t call me a \u201cgroundskeeper\u201d as that would mean more pay.. He\u2019s a millionaire but his gardening tools are medieval. Been clearing woodland, so dense that hardly any light gets in. Can\u2019t remember what my hands looked like without all the muddy blood. Found a curious spherical brick building, like a hobbit-hole.\n\nJan 29th\nIt\u2019s an ice house; I looked it up. Maybe something saleable inside? There are old crucifixes on the door, but they don\u2019t look valuable. I\u2019m no thief; the way I see it, he owes me. I\u2019ll call it \u201carsehole tax\u201d. Had a good look around the ice house, then hid it again under dead wood. The little round door gave a little, when I pressed all of my weight against it. Through the narrow opening, a blast of air whistled out, so cold that my skin stung. There\u2019s still ice inside!!!\n\nJan 31st\nDay off!  Finally was able to return to the ice house. Took a flashlight and crowbar. There\u2019s no windows. It\u2019s more like a \u201cHobbit-prison\u201d. Took ages to open the door just wide enough to slip inside. The flashlight beam didn\u2019t penetrate far into the darkness. All around me I heard the snap-snap-snap of huge ice cubes breaking apart.

Her manager went down to the basement to investigate, but when he opened the storage unit, he found it empty. He started calling out Nancy's name, but there was no answer. \n\nSuddenly, a voice whispered in his ear, \"She's mine now.\" The manager quickly backed away and locked the storage unit, promising the entity that it would have another meal for it as soon as they re-posted the receptionist role.

She held out two fingers.\n\n\"No,\" Harlan said. \"Just one.\"\n\nHe pushed me toward her. \"What you want?\" she asked.\n\n\"Fresh meat,\" Harlan answered for me.\n\nThe woman left.\n\nShe returned with a naked middle-aged cripple, eyes down, shoulders turned inward. *This is fresh?*\n\nHarlan grabbed my shoulders. \"Show my friend the smorgasbord.\"\n\nThe old woman wheeled out a wooden tray covered with *weapons*, *surgical implements*, *tools*...\n\n\"The fuck?\"\n\n\"What you fancy?\" the old woman asked. \"You like knife maybe?

Dammit- he only had 33 canisters- not enough to the gas the number of Yazidi Christians he had rounded up in his gas chamber centre. He needed more- he had gassed enough of them to be close to promotion to next level and he wanted that so badly. \n\nHe texted his friend and roommate, Kris. It was funny how even though Kris was literally sharing the same space with him, they still ended up texting through the system. It was more convenient, as they could action items, and copy-and-paste their texts to others. \n\nBut Kris didn\u2019t fulfill Ali\u2019s request for canisters. Ali watched his words flicker on the screen \u201cNo way dude- I received and docketed a train full of Jews- 253. I need everything I got.\u201d\n\nAli sighed. This obsession with Jewish people was so childish and ridiculous. He looked back at his screen, and adjusted his camera so he could have a better look at the corpses of the Kurdish prisoners he had ordered to be hanged earlier- their cell had been mutinous. It felt so good- he had been riding that high for most of the day- it had got him through the challenges of dealing with the Christians. Ugh. Fucking losers. There were 25 prisoners left in that cell, he decided to have them flogged before he figured out the canister situation- it would earn him some points at the very least, and really it was the only viable course of action right now. \n\nHe started texting instructions to his captain, Jamal. Jamal didn\u2019t respond right away- idiot, he must have logged off the system. That would earn him a demerits and have him slide down the ranks. Good. \n\nBruce, Ali\u2019s other housemate wandered in. Bruce was English, and focused mostly on the Northern Irish and African regions. He was very creative in how he managed his prison camps. Although the original gas chambers had a certain scientific precision and classical elegance to them, Bruce was really good at coming up with ways within the system to make them fun and entertaining. Ali guessed that was what they meant by British humour. \n\n\u201cHey man. I\u2019m going out. Are you still on that thing? Give it a rest man.\u201d \n\nThe distant screams of the prisoners being beaten flickered through the console. Jamal must have read his instructions. Good. \n\nAli turned away from Bruce with a frown. \u201cOk mom. I can play as long as I want to. Where are you off to anyway- I wanted to trade for canisters.\u201d\n\nBruce hesitated. Ali smiled to himself- Bruce could never let up on a deal- a true son of the nation of small shopkeepers. \u201cWhaddya got for me man?\u201d\n\nAli took a crisp and crunched it loudly. \u201cWhy dontcha come and see?

Stews and salads for instance, sure the bowls and cutlery might be made of diamond encrusted gold but the food itself looks not much different from what you can get from the cafe three blocks away. \n\nThat\u2019s where Tourn\u00e9e Cuts come in.\n\nTourn\u00e9e Cuts are just one of many techniques taught to chefs. These are a method of cutting vegetables into presentable oblong shapes, that look complex but are actually deceptively simple and quick to do. With fairly little effort and no cost suddenly that boring mish mash of mixed vegetables or that sprinkle of cucumber on stew looks fancy and worth the tens or hundreds of dollars you paid for it. \n\nThis isn\u2019t limited to just vegetables either. While you can\u2019t use Tournee cuts for meat since they\u2019re too soft what you can do is carve up the meat in ways that accentuate their presentation.

I turned it off out of horror and didn't dare to finish watching. \n\nI uploaded the video to Reddit. Some people were freaked out by it, and others said it was fake. Then I got the message: \"Address?\" The man was an exorcist. \n\nHe's finally here, but he doesn't look like an exorcist. He's dressed in a biker jacket and jeans. \"Hello.\" I greet him, but he won't look at me. \"Stay here.\" He walks towards my room. After a while, he returns. He walks past me and speaks one word. \"Done.\" I have a strange feeling. I'll look at the footage. It doesn't matter what's on it now that it's gone. \n\nI see him walk down the corridor and stop in front of my bedroom door. The shadowy figure in the hat appeared in front of him. The exorcist opened his mouth, and his jaw stretched down to the level of his chest. His hands went black, and his fingers stretched out like long claws and encircled the shadowy figure. He swallowed the shadowy figure. Then he caught a glimpse of the camera. He smiled. \n\nI invited a monster to get rid of another monster. I have a strong urge to look at the other footage. I'm terrified, but I need to know more. \n\nAccording to the night vision camera, a creature came out of the wall. It had an enormous skull of a goat. It was wearing a cloak. It looked like the cloak was sewn together from bits of skin. I don't know why the skin pieces came to mind. \n\nWith a screech, it opened the door to my room and bared razor-sharp fangs. The shadowy figure ran out of the hallway with a stomp and attacked the creature. The creature disappeared. The shadowy figure watched me for a moment and then left. \n\nBehind my back, the door is just opening with a creak. But this time, there's no one to save me. I've left my protector, the shadowy figure, to another monster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675881625.0,"comments":[{"author":"skyavenger2","text":"Love it","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1675915412.0},{"author":"DarkWinchester","text":"Welcome to the comments. \n\nIf you're interested in the story and would like to read a longer, better version, you can find it here: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OwnHorrorStories\/comments\/10vdr6q\/i\\_shouldnt\\_have\\_called\\_that\\_exorcist\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OwnHorrorStories\/comments\/10vdr6q\/i_shouldnt_have_called_that_exorcist\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\nOnly stories up to 500 words are allowed on this subreddit, so I'm posting the shorter version here.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675881661.0},{"author":"ArgiopeAurantia","text":"You could always call him back for dessert.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675916700.0}]},{"title":"The Data Center","author":"LucRichards","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10xe0wf\/the_data_center\/","text":"Half a mile long and nestled in the plains near the airport sits a bland building.

Sure you do.\n\nMaybe the air feels just a bit too warm. Maybe you catch the smell of some strange perfume. Maybe there is a slight flutter to the curtains and yet no breeze. Maybe it's not anything you can quite put your finger on.\n\n\"Ohhhh, we have a ghost\", you might say to yourself, a sardonic smile on your lips. That was Stephanie's line. She felt it too, but to her it was just a trick of the mind after a long day. She even hinted I might be getting a bit paranoid, that maybe I could use a vacation.\n\nOr, if you're like me, you might start checking the doors for signs of tampering. When you find nothing, you might move to the windows and, before you realize, you might be taking an axe to your walls to make sure no one is living inside them. By that point she wasn't hinting anymore. She simply took her things and left. We both knew she wasn't coming back. I was glad she was out of the house.\n\nHowever you choose to deal with it, the one thing you cannot do is ignore that feeling. Because that's what gets you killed. Or worse.\n\nBefore I tell you the next part, I want you to walk into the room next door. Go ahead, just a small trip down the hall. I want you to feel it. Does it feel empty? I bet it does now, but what about right when you first walked in?

She says if we come back she'll come home with us and hurt me.\"\n\nThe next few weeks were pretty rough, as Suzie went through test after test, both physical and psychological. During this time my wife and I were terrified that they would find a brain tumour or some other horrific reason for the episode at the playground. In the end it was determined she was either showing signs of a very active imagination or schizophrenia. It was rare for kids as young as Suzie, but as it runs in my family, the doctors weren't ruling it out.\n\nAfter things were back to relative normalcy and Suzie hadn't had any hallucinations since the playground, we returned there from our neck of the woods. She made an effort to enjoy running around with the other kids, playing tag and hide and seek.  \nStill, on the ride home she was more quiet than usual, looking rather pensive.I glanced at her in the rear-view mirror.   \n\"Did you have fun with your friends back there?\"  \nShe shrugged and stared out the window as we left the multi-storied buildings of the town behind us.  \n\"At least the mean girl wasn't there anymore\", I said.  \n\"But she was there, daddy.

Maybe her parents know us or something.\"  \nShe shrugged. I turned on the radio.\n\nSuzie went to sleep at 8 p.m. that night, rather early for her, but me and my wife were happy to have the night to ourselves. We were both asleep by nine on the living room couch. On the TV screen contestants on the verge of tears scrambled to bake a cake. We were woken up by a blood-curling scream. Had only one of us woken up, one might have thought it was only a dream, as Suzie had never made that kind of sound. But there we were, wide awake and rushing upstairs to her room. Suzie was asleep under the covers. A nightmare, we figured and slouched back downstairs.\n\nThe next morning she was gone. She had made her bed (she never did that), gotten dressed and left through the front door while we were still asleep. This was eight years ago. We still go to the playground every week, my wife and I, hoping to see our Suzie there.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675872218.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"My Wife Doesn't Like Who I've Become","author":"lhkforney","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10wbi3i\/my_wife_doesnt_like_who_ive_become\/","text":" \n\nMy wife turned to look at me while we sat next to each other in bed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like who you\u2019ve become,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we got married, you were still fun and gentle and understanding.

Now I know that I am married and that sharing is part of the equation, there are some things though in my opinion, that you must keep to yourself. One of those things being password and pin related social media accounts and bank cards. All individuals must have some form of privacy and I will admit from a personal perspective, I didn't feel comfortable sharing my pins and password to my wife. It made me feel claustrophobic and I am a person that also needs privacy. \n\nMy wife though wouldn't let it go and so I decided to do as she wanted, and we both knew each other's passwords for every social media accounts, pin numbers on bank cards and passwords to streaming services. I then booked her to go on a weekend away on a 6 star luxury hotel where even billionares stay at, just her alone just so she cab have some me time. She is always stressing about stuff, and yes I was still rather annoyed at being broken down by her and telling her all of my passwords to everything. \n\nI promised her that I will prove to her why it's always bad to share passwords to everything that needs a password, even between married couples. As she was enjoying her luxurious hotel treatment and enjoying the finest of foods and experiences, as well as just enjoying having time to herself away from the kids and in general, getting away from responsibilities. I was so happy for her and when she asked me how much it had all cost me, I told her that it was all free. She became concerned after that, when I told her it was free, but I managed to reassure her that it's all OK. \n\nThen when her luxurious 3 day weekend had ended, she was arrested by police. What she didn't realise at the time and missed many worded signs at the hotel due to her excitement blinding her, this hotel offers free weekends stays for killers, burglars and any criminal. It was a genius idea by the police department to catch criminals. I mean most serial killers are narcissistic and fame hungry. \n\nYou have to show proof of your crime either before, during or after your luxurious stay. At the end of her stay, I sent the picture of our dead children which I killed when she left our home for the hotel, and i sent it to the hotel which was time stamped when she left the house on Friday.

Once Tommy tried to beat me up after school; he took one step toward me, slipped on an icy patch, and broke his arm.  That time that Jenny tried to put gum in my hair?  A bird pooped RIGHT on her hand before she could get to me.\n\nOne day, Kiki wasn't there for over a week.  I hadn't heard from her at all.  I couldn't stop by her house; I'd never been because it wasn't allowed and she didn't have a cell phone.  Kids grew bolder but I was quick to get away.  On my way home from school one late Friday, I could swear someone was following me.  I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, shadows all twisted at the late hour.  I turned the corner when suddenly from behind the trees lining my driveway out jumped Tommy, a strange look in his eyes.  I tried to call out but he was on me in minutes, pinning me against a tree and brandishing a knife.  I sobbed as he dragged the flat edge against the side of my face and he whispered about how he was going to teach me a lesson for befriending freaks.  He looked at me as he brought the blade up.  \"Your eyes are so pretty, so that is the first thing to go...\" he whispered as he slowly moved the edge across cornea of my right then left eye.  Everything was red and pain.  I sobbed.  Suddenly, I smelled sage.\n\nWhile I'm not exactly sure what happened, I heard Kiki's call and Tommy released me.  I fell to the ground amidst sounds of a fight.  I heard Tommy cry out in pain.  Some time later, Kiki picked me up and took me away from my house.  Things faded to black and when I awoke, I was in a warm home that smelled strongly of sage and other things.  My eyes were bandaged.  Kiki spoke in a voice older than time, \"I am so sorry I cannot heal your eyes with my magic; it is not that kind I bare.  I can give you your own magic.  You will now have vision beyond what others see.  I will teach you how to use this.\"\n\nMagic comes with a price.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675809971.0,"comments":[{"author":"SCP_radiantpoison","text":"Oh wow!

He put his car in park and knocked back the rest of his pre-workout, already feeling the itch in his face. The late winter chill was freezing in his tank-top and gym shorts, and the door to the gym was over fifty feet away. Even though he shivered, he kept his chin up.\n\nToday was leg day, the cold wouldn\u2019t bother him much longer. He put in his air-pods, and started making his way. As he scrolled through his music, he noticed someone at the door ahead was entering the gym, and had stopped to hold the door open for him. Noah motioned for him to \u201cgo ahead\u201d, he was still all the way across the parking lot. Seemed a little far away to be worrying about it.\n\nNoah returned to his phone, decided on soft and sweet. He would warm up with a few miles on the treadmill. He selected Brian McKnight. \n\nAs the song started playing, he looked up to see the man still holding the door. He was still only halfway across the parking lot. Still too soon. Annoying, even.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good!\u201d Noah\u2019s words were swallowed by the wind, and he waved him off again. \n\nThe guy just stood there, one hand holding the door with the other hanging limp. Noah noticed then, that not only was he pretty tall, he was hardly dressed for a workout. And his hair was long as fuck.\n\n*Huh?*\n\nOld, black leather duster whipping in the wind. Faded, army-camo cargo pants with\u2026 white boots?\n\n\u201cGo for it man, c\u2019mon! I\u2019ll catch up!\u201d Noah shouted, unable to hear himself over the lullaby in his ears. \n\nThe man just held the door and stared, his mouth opening slowly, as if to say something. But his mouth formed no words, only kept opening wider. And wider.\n\n*What the fuck?*\n\nNoah stopped, now only twenty feet away. The man watched and waited, his mouth unhinging like a snake. The pre-workout pumped through his blood, heating his face despite the chill. If he didn\u2019t work out, he\u2019d get nauseous. But the man at the door, and the\u2026gym?\n\nHe didn\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t notice before, but the lights were off in the gym. There wasn\u2019t anybody inside, either.\n\nAhead, the man\u2019s jaw opened so wide, it would fit his head if he tried. His limp arm reached for him, waving him in. Noah swallowed hard, and he started to sweat.\n\n\u201cAh shit, I forgot something. Maybe next time!\u201d Noah chuckled awkwardly, turning on his heel. He\u2019d decided to just jog back to the car and bail\u2014\n\nThe parking lot was empty, all the other cars gone. All except his. The only thing stranger than the empty lot, was the door to the back seat opening just a crack. Long limbs and wispy hair slithered across the pavement, impossibly slinking into his car.\n\nWhite boots tucked in, and the door closed.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675815212.0,"comments":[{"author":"TryHardKenichi","text":"If Noah ran, he could still burn off that pre-workout and work up a sweat.","upvotes":34,"created_utc":1675815702.0},{"author":"krissymo77","text":"See this is why I don't go to the gym!

Though the bark chips lining the ground never *actually* turned into lava, they certainly became molten hot for at least ten minutes. Several eyewitnesses described an odd dichotomy of being able to feel the heat, though everything appeared as normal. In addition, photographic evidence confirms that nearby snow melted and even evaporated in a way suggesting that the heat event was localized to the bark chips themselves.\n2. Though there were only four fatalities, at least thirty children suffered burns of some kind, and sixteen parents suffered mild to severe injuries during various rescue attempts. The fatalities and worst injuries all occurred in younger children and toddlers who fell over during the event and were unable to stand up before succumbing to the heat.\n\nIt is not known whether Child X was actually responsible for the events or a victim himself.\n\nSeveral witnesses describe him swinging gleefully from the monkey bars and singing a song from the  TV show *Paw Patrol* even as the other children screamed and melted around him.\n\nWhile one mother identified Child X as Billy Cunningham, the victim of a nearby trailer fire last April, others claimed he looked more like Asa Blankenship, a homeless teen who froze to death under the Parkside Bridge.\n\nThat said, it is widely agreed that Child X indeed grew serious at one point and climbed to the roof of the playground\u2019s highest parapet, pointing at the crowd and accusing them of some sort of collective failure. Whether the speech was too difficult to hear over the screaming or contained a message that the witnesses preferred not to repeat remains unknown.\n\nIt is considered fact that Child X ultimately leapt from the structure, disappearing into thin air as his feet touched the ground, at which point the bark chips returned to their original temperature.\n\nA memorial is planned for this coming Sunday. The park will be closed until further notice.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675789777.0,"comments":[{"author":"Rivers9999","text":"Wtf.

Small. Imperceptibly gradual.\n\nMaybe, I guessed, some kids took to spinning in the park a little more each day. A skater at winter-frozen Wren Lake found it strange that she lingered a little longer in her upright spin than desired. *I must be out of practice.*\n\nAs things progressed, ball room dancers taking a class at the Y, one asking their partner to please stop spinning so much they were making them scared.\n\nTruthfully, I don\u2019t know how it began.\n\nBut the way things are, many of the people in my town won\u2019t stop spinning. We thought it was a virus at first.\n\nIn most cases, if you were to try spinning around in circles indefinitely, far past disorientation and discomfort, you would eventually lose consciousness. Centrifugal force would impede blood flow to the brain.\n\n*Something* is keeping them going.\n\nThey get violent when they spin, too. What I mentioned about Wren Lake and ice skating is somewhat based on what I saw out there. Driving by the lake, I saw ice skaters spinning, cutting each other with the blades of their skates. I caught an image of red splashed through the air as easy as ducks lifting to the sky.\n\nWe called it the spin virus for a while. The town got shut down, no one in or out. Military vehicles parked at exits, makeshift fences cordoning off. All attempts at journalism were nipped, would-be news makers loaded into unmarked vans and squealed away. Government lackies in hazmat suits materialized and put up their tents and tubes like it was all one big playhouse at a fast-food restaurant.\n\nPeople spinning. Scratching others with fingernails and sharp objects. Sometimes biting.\n\nThe owner of the local hunting goods store (we\u2019ve only got one) was the first I saw to shoot a few of them. *In your defense*, he later said. My son and I were running into his shop and all I heard was the rifle blast and the ringing in my ears, turned to see the first drop. Another few blasts and I was late in telling my son not to look as gory, winter-steamed, still spinning bodies hit the asphalt with a WUFFF-WUFF.\n\nMy son was screaming near the opening and closing glass doors. Open, close, screaming. The spinners continued to spin on the ground. *Muscle spasms*, the store owner said calmly. But this *was* his first rodeo, because these spinners persisted in their efforts to spin on the ground.\n\nWe tied up one spinner in the backroom, on a couch, using heavy duty tree stand rope from the shop. The 30-something man continued to try to spin, bones breaking, folds of flesh popping and oozing, reddened eyes rolling, sometimes catching on us.\n\nThe tied spinner\u2019s teeth chattered. Chipped pieces of teeth spun out as he broke himself. Shop owner said the chattering was morse code, deciphered it:\n\nI AM BUER.

Whoever, or whatever, was in the kitchen looked and sounded exactly like his mother...but wasn't. He couldn't pinpoint what gave it away. Her hair was done in the same pinned up style she usually wore. She sounded the same as she always had, a slight lilt to her voice that made her sound as if she were singing, even when she was just talking. When he left this morning, she was wearing the same dress that this person is wearing now. Not a similar dress. The same dress. He had memories of his mother in that dress. Several years ago on a clear night, his mother, father, sister, and he all sat around a bonfire and made s'mores. They often looked back and laughed at the memory of his mother dripping marshmallow onto her dress that was so hot it ate a hole through the material. He could see the tiny, almost invisible hole in the hem of that blue and yellow checkered dress right now. But the person, (creature?), beneath was not the woman he had known for the 13 years of his life. \n\n   Although it felt like hours, all these thoughts shot through his brain in a matter of seconds as he walked into the house. As the door clicked closed behind him, the thing in the kitchen turned around to face him.\n\n   It was her face...but not. Her eyes were a little off, too turned up at the corners. Her smile was almost exact, save for the dimple his mother had in her cheek. A chill went through his entire body as its eyes locked onto his and it smiled. He was frozen in place, completely paralyzed with fear. \n\n   \"How'd it go hon?\" it asked in his mother's voice. \n\n\"G-good,\" he managed to stammer out. He knew he was sweating, fidgeting. He was barely able to keep his entire body from shaking.\n\n   Its smile faltered for a second, quickly recovering, but he saw it. \"Can I get you anything?\" it asked with mock concern. He shook his head no, looking at the floor. \"Going to my room,\" he mumbled and turned on his heel, his heart pounding at the idea of giving his back to this threat. Luckily, he only had to make it a few steps before he heard the sound of keys in the front door. His dad was home! His dad would know what to do, know how to figure out what was going on. He raced around the corner to the front door, only stop dead in his tracks. \n\n   Someone that looked like his father was closing and locking the door behind him. \n\nNo.\n\nIt was his dad...wasn't it?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675811101.0,"comments":[{"author":"Yogibear990","text":"Capgras syndrome?

The beasts appeared when the nights became longer than the days. We don\u2019t know why this happened. No one alive knows what they even look like. Large cities became a buffet for them. We didn\u2019t stand a chance. Everyone left fled to the wild. The beasts scream throughout the night to lure us in. We learned quickly that to follow the screams was to die. To be alone is best but lonely. Any group larger than three is an easy target. So, it\u2019s just me and Harp. We don\u2019t talk. Just having another human present in this hellscape is all either of us needs.\n\nIn the short hours of daylight we travel and make runs to nearby towns and empty houses for supplies. Sometimes we see the dead. Their entrails always splayed across the ground. Sometimes we see the living, always white faced and silent, too afraid to make a connection with others.\n\nTonight as we huddle around our smothered fire, something happens. The child scream isn\u2019t just a scream. It\u2019s words. It says \u201chelp me!\u201d The beasts can\u2019t speak. I know it\u2019s human. Something inside of me snaps and I begin to run to it.

Of course, it wouldn't work if it says that you will die because of something common, like old age, or electrocution. You can't simply stop using everything with electric energy.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, if you choose to know when you will die, you will have a sort of a time limit to do everything you want.

It was work either way, the only difference was the pay. But truth be told, you did earn more as a fisherman, especially with a catch like tonight's.\n\nYet, as he hesitated to begin his labor, shriveled against the bite of the wind, he could not drive the strangeness of the contract from his mind. It was his first time digging outside a cemetery. That was not unusual by itself, plenty of folk passed on at odds with the Lord and had to arrange for alternative accommodations in which to await the war to come. But this place, this dark forest where the branches vaulted over him like the roof of some ancient cavern, where a single tree laid marked with a red arrow pointing him to his quarry, did not sit right with him.\n\nAt last he began to dig. Eyes watched him from the shadows, but he did not see them. As he worked, he wondered, not for the first time, how exactly his employer had come upon this body. A man in his position should know better than to ask such questions, but, after dealing with the droves of medical students looking to improve their trade and the onslaught of macabre collectors in search of the next piece for their cabinets, he got the feeling that this was something altogether different.  It was almost as if...\n\nThe sound of crackling wood somewhere behind him brought him out of his reverie. He looked around, struggling to make out anything in the dark. At the edge of his vision, he saw the light shift, but when he turned he could not tell whether the shadow he had seen had been real or only a cloud passing by the moon.\n\nHe resumed digging with redoubled ferocity. His breathing was strained and his crazed glance wildly scanned the foliage, missing the encroaching figure. At last, he came upon something rigid. Abandoning his shovel, he dropped to his knees  and started to clear away the dirt with his hands. \n\nHe knew the face of the dead man well. He had seen it everyday of his life, staring back at him from the mirror.

I, who have always been a lover of sleep, now find myself ensnared in a realm of darkness each time I am too tired to keep my eyes open. This paralysis has seized control of my nights, and I am incapacitated against its grip.\n\nIn a state of slumber not too long ago, I encountered a figure that would shape the course of my existence. As I lay immobile, captive to the grip of the night, a being emerged before me, its visage shrouded in shadows. It introduced itself as Hara, a demon that had been observing me from the beyond.\n\nWith a voice both seductive and menacing, Hara proclaimed that I was unique, a singular connection to the realm of sleep, where only in slumber would I find solace and true happiness. The demon offered to guide me to this world, a place to repose from the fear and the pain of the waking world. Hara promised me eternal peace, a release from my suffering.\n\nAs I gazed into the depths of Hara's obsidian eyes, a feeling of unease crept over me. The demon's words echoed within my mind, promising eternal rest and happiness, but I could not shake the nagging suspicion that something was amiss. \n\n\"Pray tell, what exactly is this 'eternal sleep' you speak of? Is it truly the blissful repose you claim it to be?\"\n\nHara's lips curled into a sly smile, revealing razor sharp teeth. \n\n\"Ah, my dear John, eternal sleep is a state of being beyond the comprehension of mortal men. It is a dreamless slumber where all fears, worries and pain are forgotten.\" \n\n\"And what of the cost of such slumber?\" I asked, my voice trembling. \"What must I sacrifice in order to achieve this paradise?\"\n\n\"Why, John, the cost is of little consequence. A simple signature upon a contract, and the rest will be taken care of. Consider it a small price to pay for an eternity of peace.\"\n\nAnd as he finished his sentence, I saw demons, their twisted forms so unkempt and raw, with eyes that blazed like fiery coals and fangs that gnashed like saws. I bolted for the door. \n\nDesperate to escape, I stumbled upon a door. In a moment of recklessness, I threatened to leave, but Hara warned me against it. The demon's voice was low and menacing, filled with a dark power that filled me with dread.\n\n\"Foolish mortal,\" Hara hissed, \"you think to escape the contract so easily? The realm of sleep is eternal, and you are bound to it for all eternity. Leave now, and you will face a fate far worse than any nightmare.\"\n\nFor moment I believed that I was in still in a dream. But alas, I could move my head, twitch my face, open and close my eyes.

As an unexpected shock to all of us that made us angry and sad. Back in 2019 my niece started displaying awkward behaviours. She started dropping objects she held without realising it. Her IQ seemed to start dropping and her memory seemed to be faulty. She started forgetting things she had beem taught in school and soon she started forgetting people. It became worse and worse so my aunt took her to the hospital. They scanned her head,i think an MRI and noticed a lump in her brain. A lump of tissue was forming near her brain stem . We were very worried and concerned and scared that she had a brain tumour. It developed and we arranged for a brain surgery in the United States of America. For context we live in Africa so she was flown there with a few relatives for the surgery. Desperate times . I was in boarding school at the time and when i came for holiday i was updated. The surgery happened and she came back to us...but not all of her. They could not remove all of it. The doctors told us it wasn't cancer and we rejoiced at that fact. But she had regressed. A shadow of her former self. It seemed like part of her had gone with the tumour. She had to be dropped to a lower grade . We had to teach her again about potty training and how to speak and everything else. But she recovered well.\n\nUntil it happened again.More this time.\n\nFlashforward to a month ago. She was diagnosed with multiple tumours in her brain. The news was heartbreaking especially for her . She asked us, why her? Why did this demon decide to prey on her alone ? Why was she the only one with tumours ? This nearly broke my heart. Have you ever seen someone in pain to the point it breaks your heart? Anguish,almost tangible , surrounding her and infecting us? Despair with its dark powerful hands pulling someone to its deep depths and you have no ability to save that person. The feeling of watching the inevitability of death as it slowly consumes someone you love until all you are left with is a corpse and memories? All you can do is cry. Words cannot pull that person from the labyrinth of darkness that they are falling into. Believe me we tried. We now knew it was cancer. We arranged surgery in India but that gut feeling inside me told me that death was coming. I could not think of what to tell her as she boarded her last plane. I did not know what to do as we embraced and she cried her heart out,the fear of death visible in her shaking,despair riddled in her once beautiful features. She was 11 years old at the time. A whole future before her but she would not live to see it. All i could do was hold her as she sobbed and shuddered. And that was the last I ever saw of her.\n\nThe news came late at night. I could hear my mother's sobs from my bedroom door as she received the news . As she came to tell me news i already knew. As we all came together to mourn and cry for the loss of our little niece,i could not help but think of her last words to me, You're next.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675780692.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Consumed Souls [The Haunted Playground Challenge]","author":"Thrawn911","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10w36r7\/consumed_souls_the_haunted_playground_challenge\/","text":"\u201cSo, let\u2019s begin, Mr. Clarke.

He talked with him at night, we could hear it through the walls with my wife. At first, we thought it was just an imaginary friend. Then we started to see shadows. Shadows of a kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the corner of rooms, in dark places, I even saw it in a mirror behind me one time.

I have a feeling like something is watching us. Then I started to see even more shadows there. On the swings, on the benches, around the small lake, everywhere. Two days ago, I had to escape. I ran back home. My wife thought I was crazy.  \n\n\u201cYou left your son there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI immediately ran back as soon as I realized how stupid I was. It was dark. I searched for him for like an hour, it was already 9 pm.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you find him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But\u2026 oh, god. I found him sitting on a bench. I swear he wasn\u2019t there before, I know I checked the whole playground multiple times. He had blood on him, and huge scars on his face and arm. He jumped at me, and screamed. It was a horrifying scream. I lost my consciousness, and- I don\u2019t  know how I got here.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the therapist said, as his face got darker and transformed into another shadowy figure, just like the ones Clarke saw on the playground. Clarke opened his mouth and gave out a high-pitched, super loud scream. The shadow creature used its huge claws to tear apart Clarke\u2019s chest. \n\nThe police found his body an hour later. The playground\u2019s owner paid some money to the police the next day, so the case was closed immediately. The kid\u2019s body was never found.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675780139.0,"comments":[{"author":"Thrawn911","text":"Thank you for reading!\r  \n\r  \nTo see more of my work, please visit me at r\/polgari.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675780219.0},{"author":"Unique_Pickle3951","text":"This is a very interesting story!

His curled arms swaying like a branch caught up in a breeze, he was trying to lift his head to find out what was happening.\n\n'There is no mistaking it', thought Boema, 'that's Logan.' Logan from his childhood. Logan for whom he decided to be the guardian when, one day, he saw the neighborhood kids bullying him. Logan was so silent, so weak, so broken but for some reason Boema in his young heart felt such tenderness for him. Many days he took Logan around the town in his wheelchair and each time it felt like an adventure because he could see the thrill on Logan's face. 'Do you remember', Boema reminded himself, 'when you built a special chair on a bike for Logan so you both could speed down Oren Hill? Do you remember the cries of joy bursting out from Logan's mouth? That's Logan right there. Do you see him? Do you see yourself?'\n\nLouise started packing in her room.

After normal boring exams like maths, English and science, the cheating exam is the last one they must all do. It's the most exciting one and all of the students must find a way to successfully cheat the history exam. History was chosen for the cheating exam. If they get caught cheating during the cheating exam, then they fail, but if they complete to answer all questions through cheating, then they pass and they then can tell us how they did it. Everyone is worried for a missing student called Liam and nobody knows what has happened to him, he will miss the cheating exam. \n\nWhen the cheating exam starred I noticed straight away, that gilains eyes were flashing as she had computer contact lenses, and someone from outside of school was typing her the answers. How disappointing. I also noticed Barton's ear plugs and I can hear someone's voice from the ear plugs, telling Barton the answers. How disappointing. Then there was Holland, and he had multiple chewing gun stuck under his table with a piece of paper that had the answers. Multiple students were passing around chewed chewing gums, how disgusting. \n\nThen there was ericka, she called off sick and had her parents take the test from home. The stupid girl though recorded everything on social media. If she had waited after she had submitted the paper, then surely she would have passed the cheating exam. Then there was tudack, he always bought 6 bus tickets one for his ass, 2 for his hands, 2 for his feet and 1 for his head so that he could lay down on the bus seat with his feet up. Then he will remember the answers written on the bus tickets given to him by the genius bus driver. How the bus driver got the answers? Not sure but if he was a student he would have passed the cheating exam. \n\nThen on the results day for the cheating exam, everyone was surprised when I said \"everyone has failed apart from liam\" and everyone gasped and they shouted \"Mr Pollock Liam is missing though\" and the real Mr Pollock stepped into class with police officers. \n\nI took off my silicone hyper-realistic mask to look like Mr Pollock,  and we were also the same height and body build as well. A month before the cheating exams, after when the boring normal exams were completed, I attacked Mr Pollock and made him unconscious and imprisoned him in his own home. I pretended to be him and took the cheating test in the same hall as the other students, but with Mr Pollock's answer sheet and sitting at his desk, and submitted it when I completed it. After completing it I phoned the police to free Mr Pollock. \n\n\"No don't arrest Liam, he passed the cheating exam. It's the only exam he has passed\" the real Mr Pollock admitted.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675690620.0,"comments":[{"author":"mapo_tofu_lover","text":"Very creative and unique, but the story needs a bit polishing and proofreading lol","upvotes":389,"created_utc":1675708080.0},{"author":"hellothere-3000","text":"Unique concept and twist, but you need to work on your grammar and storytelling \ud83e\udd23","upvotes":355,"created_utc":1675706355.0},{"author":"MystiqueMisha","text":"Great story!

Looks like jellyfish, costs a ton, and smells like industrial rubber, but it's supposed to be really good for you. No sugar, no fat, tons of fiber and vitamins. I thought I'd try, since everybody's talking about it.\n\nMy first attempt was an absolute disaster. I dumped it in a stir fry, straight from the package. It stank up my kitchen for several days, and whatever I'd just made, I threw straight in the trash. \u201dNever again\u201d, I thought.\n\nBut then I overheard my coworkers talking about it. Apparently, if you first boil it, and then fry it with spices, the smell goes away. One of them was eating it for lunch, and it was true! I couldn't smell it at all, and it looked pretty good.\n\nSo I tried again, and it really worked in a stir fry. And soup. And lasagne. Curry, casserole, cupcake and coconut sauce. It was amazing. It made me feel amazing.\n\nThe paste went viral online, so I wasn't the only one convinced. You wouldn't believe it, someone even made it into a \"chicken breast\" that couldn't be told apart from real chicken! The grocery store was constantly out. Even when they reserved a whole aisle for the paste, they still had trouble keeping it stocked. The selection of pasta, rice, and even candy and alcohol kept getting smaller when they had to make more shelf space for the paste.\n\nIt really got out of control. People weren't buying much else anymore, and on my way to work, I had to slalom through the line of people waiting for the store to open. But that was nothing compared to when the producers started having problems keeping up with the demand.\n\nThe price increased way too high for me to get it anymore. Only the richest and the vilest could get the paste, and by the vilest, I mean the ones who will do anything to fund their habits. Stores are robbed all the time, as are people. These days, carrying a bag of groceries in public is begging for a weapon in your face. I can't go to work anymore, the streets aren't safe. There's always someone with a stronger desire for the paste.\n\nSo here I am, sitting at home with nothing to do, watching the news. Watching helicopter footage of a mob pushing through barricaded grocery store doors, ripping each others' limbs out to improve their own chances of getting some paste. Brainless crowd.\n\nIt's not like your body can fully absorb the paste, some of it's always wasted. I suck another spoonful into my mouth. This morning's shit is already tepid as I smack it with my tongue, cheeks bulging out. It squishes against my teeth and palate, kind of hard to swallow, but I think I can still detect a hint of the paste in it.\n\nGlad I'm not like those idiots on TV, who're willing to do the stupidest things to get more.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675703231.0,"comments":[{"author":"Sprattus_Sprattus","text":"This story may or may not have been inspired by konnyaku.\n\nRemember kids: superfood is a marketing term, used to cheat you into paying more money for a product you wouldn't otherwise even want.

Dave watched them both with a smug look on his face, hands thrust deep into the pockets of his coat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to get sweaty. This coat is fuckin toasty.

Back in the \u201880s a drunk-driver had jumped the curb and plowed through a fence and into this playground. The entire school was out at recess. Four boys playing basketball were killed instantly, and two girls playing tetherball died shortly after. People said if you parked a car on the basketball court at night small handprints would appear on it as if children were trying to push it or move it.  Some said that if you were drinking you would hear tiny fists hitting the car.\n\nDave shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s been forty-five minutes already.

Nothing happened when he pushed the ignition button.\n\n\u201cDid it just get colder? \u201d Ryan asked, his breath puffing into fog. \u201cIs that hail?\u201d\n\nThe faint tinking Ryan heard grew louder, faster, and soon turned into pounding.

So I had to step out side for a minute so my ears would stop ringing, while I was outside I for some reason decided to walk around the cemetery. I don\u2019t know why I did especially when the only light was the full moon, but I did. So while I wondered around I looked for people I was related to.\nA lot of the people who were buried there I knew the descendants of, but no one I was related to. As I wondered the moon seemed to stay in the exact same place,and I\u2019m not gonna lie and say that didn\u2019t make me feel like something was a bit off. What also put me on edge was the fact that I couldn\u2019t find anyone I was related to. I knew that I had at least three relatives buried there. At last I found a name I recognized well it was a last name, Jones. It wasn\u2019t to strange, it\u2019s a common last name. But the first name caused me to fall back into the snow bank, it was mine. I felt my hands start to shake as I picked my self up and brushed the snow off the date to see that it was my birthday day and the date of my death was today. I was freaking out at this point I couldn\u2019t even feel my heart beating. So I ran back to the door of the building and tried to get back inside but I couldn\u2019t get the door to open so I started pounding on it and there was no response, it was like nobody was there in the first place. I couldn\u2019t feel anything hypothermia was starting to creep in, so with my clouded judgement I ran. I didn\u2019t know were I was running, but that didn\u2019t matter at this point. I kept running until I could no more, then I turned to look back to see the hall I had tried so hard to run from. I could feel my eyes staring to tear, then I turned back around to see that I was standing in the middle of the road. I couldn\u2019t see or hear anything coming but the stones were shaking because of something heavy. Then I heard it, the sound of a semi trucks horn screaming for me to move. But I couldn\u2019t, I was stuck then suddenly I felt my whole world shift as I collapsed to the ground. Then I felt it. The horrific pain of the truck crushing my body like a plastic bottle. As I lay there dying I thought I heard screaming from a crowd of people, then nothing. I suddenly awoke back in my chair inside the dance hall. Was that all a dream or something, I didn\u2019t know.

They called us the problem children, but I wasn\u2019t convinced by their language.\n\nWe\u2019d all learned to speak it, of course. That stupid big-box TV sitting in the middle of the colony\u2014what else had we to do? We had no names\u2014where else were we to get them? Pamela Anderson was the only one whose mutations had made him look formidable, but the muscles under his skin were tumors. He could flop like any balloon I saw in the commercials.

She wouldn\u2019t die in this penal colony, when all that we deserved to end up here was being born outside a nuclear reactor. \n\nI often wondered what our moms were. Did we look the same? Did we miss the same eyes, the same arms? There was a show that came on our TV \u2013 called *Family Ties* \u2013 and they all looked really different but loved each other, and we all gathered around that small screen because we felt like, maybe, we were like them. We had two Mallorys and three Alexes who died. I don\u2019t even know who cleaned up the bodies as we slept. I guess the Stephens and the Elyses. I like to think so.

But his real goal was the midway \u2014 lots of open space, flimsy booths, and soft targets. Dozens, possibly hundreds, of people milled about, watching any of several attractions as the engine's growl heralded his arrival.\n\nHe turned before reaching the stage, racing around the edge of the impromptu arena, body parts scattering haphazardly around him. He then turned to stab through the middle again.\n\nHe saw a group cowering behind a small building in the center. Jerking the steering wheel again, he aimed toward them. With another mighty roar, it hurled toward the rickety shack. His eyes widened as he anticipated the collision.\n\nSuddenly the truck dropped down, stopping abruptly. The makeshift structure had apparently been built over a hidden ground depression. He floored the engine; the tires simply spun. He shifted into reverse and tried again; no change.\n\nOnly one thing to do now. He removed the guard from a big red button and stabbed at it with his thumb. The truck detonated instantaneously.\n\nAn intensely bright light preceded a terrible roar; sharp pain suddenly cut to a warm, glowing serenity.

Followed by eternal damnation?\"\n\nShe shook her head listlessly as she turned to leave. \"It boggles the mind.\"\n\nHer feathery angelic wings brushed lightly against the top of the door jamb. \"We may need to send another messiah,\" she grumbled to herself. \"And an updated holy text.

I was the classical bibliophile, loving the form and smell and heft of a tome even if I had no interest in the contents. Older books were best, bound in worn fabric and crackling with age, left forgotten on the brown shelf in the Victorian home condemned for arsenic and asbestos contamination. Hidden knowledge, companionship, escapism, and intellectualism all bound into something that I associated with comfort and the warm embrace of blankets on a cold winter evening.\n\n\nIt was no surprise that books would show up in my dreams. Dreaming, they say, is one part of the brain making up a story, and another part experiencing it. Written and directed by Prefrontal Cortex, the same organ in charge of learning and wild feats of escapism hallucination while staring at printed pages. Books and brains get along just fine, so why not include them in dreams? Perfectly sensible.\n\n\nBut reading, well, there was another matter entirely. Reading requires an entirely different part of the brain than the one that sits in the director\u2019s chair. Memorizing prose had never been one of my talents. After all, the words were right there on the page to read whenever I wanted.\n\n\nBut fuck, I love books. And I love reading. And I really love dreaming. So of course I was going to try to read every book I dreamed up.\n\n\nUsually this would cause the dream to collapse. At first, looking at anything that should have written words simply crashed the program. A new dream bloomed in place, or I would wake up, or I\u2019d slip into that liminal space that served as a test card between programs.\n\n\nBut I\u2019m stubborn, too. I finish books I dislike, because hey, semi-executive hyperfixation. It shouldn\u2019t really have come as a surprise that my stubborn insistence to read the books I dreamed up would eventually stop crashing the program.\n\n\nDirector Cortex was taking night classes - day classes? - on writing down words.\nThe words didn\u2019t make any sense at first. I\u2019d get two or three before the technical difficulties card. Then I started stringing sentences together. The grammar was awful and the sentences were meaningless, but this was amusing enough that I started seeking out every dream book I could find. Unexpectedly, the nonsense sentences were adorable. I was both amazed and amused at the semi-cogent nonsense made up of valid words strung together with no sensibility.\n\n\nBut the director was studying hard.\n\n\nNow I try to avoid books in dreams. I try to avoid dreams all together, in fact: I\u2019m trying to associate the sensation of dreaming with the urge to wake up. Every dream with a book is now a nightmare.\nDirector Cortex likes to write, and the sentences have become cogent. The only conclusion I can come to is that it\u2019s getting help. And whatever is helping is writing things that should never be read by anyone.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675674092.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"My Little Shadows","author":"therealdocturner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10uggqr\/my_little_shadows\/","text":" \n\nWe almost lost our Sadie, but we got her back, and something else came with her. She was four.\n\nIt had been a bad fever and Sadie was in the hospital for five days. There was a moment during that second day where the doctor told us that Sadie might not make it. We sat in the room staring at Sadie sleeping in that bed. Our daughter didn\u2019t deserve this.\n\nIt was on the third day that everything turned around. She was awake by the evening and she wanted to go home. Sharon and I were both actually able to get some sleep later that night, but the sound of Sadie\u2019s voice stirred me. She was leaning over the side of her bed and whispering. \n\n\u201cSadie baby, what are you doing?\u201d She turned and looked at me.\n\n\u201cJust talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney, you need to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Daddy says I have to sleep.\u201d Then she put her head back on her pillow. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time.\n\nAs Sadie came home we realized that she now had a bunch of imaginary friends. One day Sadie was in the backyard on her swing set when our neighbor\u2019s dog started to bark and scratch his front paws against the boards of the fence.\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s wrong with Barkley?\u201d She stopped swinging.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just being a butt, sweety.

There was a loud crash that came from the fence and Barkley ran away whimpering to the other side of his house.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to break the fence!\u201d Sadie giggled and she started swinging again. For the rest of the afternoon, I just watched Sadie. Every once in a while she would start to have more conversations, but then she would stop mid sentence and look over to me and smile.\n\nWe had just finished dinner that night and I was washing the dishes while my wife asked her about a picture she had just drawn. \n\n\u201cCan I show Daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Sharon held it up so I could see it from over the counter. It was of the three of us standing in front of our house, but there were seven children standing behind me. Four boys and three girls. They all had X\u2019s for eyes and flat lines for their mouths. I began to shake and my blood ran cold.\n\n\u201cWho are they, honey?\u201d My wife was confused, but I was not.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the kids who I met in the hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201cMax, Stephanie, Billy, Nathan, Gary, Michelle, and Caroline.

He needed to get away to a place where no-one knew him. He needed to escape from an abusive ex who tried to stab him in his sleep, a demented mother in law who tried poisoning his meals, and a psycho cousin who cut the brakes on his car multiple times. Be rid of everyone, Peter thought, and move to a small country town, Carrington, where no-one would know him.\n\nPeter\u2019s house is all set up. It took him two weeks to move everything by himself, painting the walls, cleaning, and some minor repairs. Being involved in software development, Peter didn\u2019t need to worry about work, or an office, as he was self-employed. Just so long as his house had a reliable internet connection, he would be fine.\n\nEven though Peter has been in Carrington for two weeks, he has not had much of a chance to explore the town, and see just what there is. So, feeling hungry, Peter decided to get dressed, and go for a walk. If he is going to live in the town for a while, he might as well find out a bit about it. \n\nThe first thing that Peter saw, was that every second shop was a butcher shop. \u201cWhy would a small town, need so many butcher shops\u201d, thought Peter. Several buses passed him while on his walk, coming from the direction of the interstate. \u201cMaybe there is a big tourist thing in town\u201d thought Peter, until he realised each one gets parked in the street behind all of the butcher shops.\n\nFinally, Peter came across a quaint little restaurant. Inside, there appears to be about 10 tables, and only two of them have people sitting at them. Peter looked at the menu outside, and saw that they do a country style hamburger, which had a very nice picture attached to it. Thinking about how it is around lunchtime, Peter decided that he would enter the restaurant, and try the hamburger. Delicious, is an understatement, as Peter thoroughly enjoyed the hamburger. It just tasted so fresh, so juicy, like nothing he had ever had before.\n\nBut now came a problem. Peter reached into his pants to pull out his wallet, only to realise that he forgot to bring it. \u201cNo matter\u201d, thought Peter. I\u2019ll just run back home and get it. \u201cWhere do you think you are going\u201d, cried out the waitress. Peter started to respond, but the waitress stopped him. \u201cYou were trying to run out on a bill, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \u201cCome with me, and I will show you what we do with bill jumpers.\u201d\n\nPeter was speechless, but just co-operated with the waitress. The waitress opened a door, and inside was a massive meat mincer. Peter stood at the edge of it, looking in. \u201cThis is a meat mincer, and this is what we do with bill jumpers\u201d, the waitress said, as she pushed Peter into the machine.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1675665575.0,"comments":[{"author":"thisistimeconsuming","text":"The people who don\u2019t tip are probably given the same service.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1675667786.0},{"author":"TerrorEyzs","text":"This one is fun, but I do have to say jumping your tenses is kinda hard to follow.

Their mission was to map M3D_2A and report to Earth on the planet\u2019s potential for exploration, colonization and commercial exploitation.\n\n\u201cIf Earth still exists,\u201d said Orliss.\n\nThey\u2019d been hibernating for thousands of Earth-years.\n\nNo contact.\n\nThey felt utterly alone.\n\n\u201cEarth\u2019s inexistence wouldn\u2019t change the mission or its parameters,\u201d said Poe.\n\n\u201cIt *would* render completion strictly impossible,\u201d muttered Dovzhenko, raising his eyes\u2014briefly\u2014from the ancient Greek tragedy he was reading.\n\nM3D_2A had been deemed \u201ccategory:interest\u201d because of two theorized characteristics, its geological make-up and the presence of over a million moons in its orbit. Small moons, yes; but moons nonetheless, and not neatly arranged in rings as around the Solar System's own giant, Saturn.\n\nNow as the Eudoxus made its final approach the three crew members could discern one more distinguishing feature:\n\nA brilliant, undulating surface.\n\n\u201cWhat in the gods\u2019 names?\u201d asked Orliss, staring at the ship\u2019s screen. \u201cThe surface\u2014it looks almost alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn ocean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith waves of such size? An illusion of some kind, surely,\" said Dovzhenko.\n\nAs for the moons, not only did they exist in the hypothesized untold numbers, but they were hardly simple spheroids. No, they resembled *things*: shapes, figures\u2014\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if they\u2019re statues hewn from stone and placed carefully into orbit around the planet,\u201d said Poe, filled with wonder.\n\n\u201cUnless my eyes deceive, some look even like spacecraft,\u201d added Orliss.\n\n\u201cSpacecraft constructed of stone,\u201d said Dovzhenko sardonically. \u201cI think our eyes deceive us more than we wish to believe.\u201d\n\nPoe ordered a preliminary scan.\n\nBut when it returned readings consistent with the existence of life, the three crew members found themselves in disagreement about how to proceed. Orliss wanted to commence mapping immediately, whereas Dovzhenko suggested deviating from the mission and making planetfall to determine conclusively whether life existed. \u201cChances of life are already slim,\u201d he argued, \u201cand the chances of intelligent life\u2014life capable of resisting us\u2014many times slimmer. There is no appreciable danger, captain. Only opportunity.\u201d\n\nPoe sided with the scientist, and Dovzhenko shuttled to the surface.\n\nPoe and Orliss watched from the Eudoxus.\n\nImmediately upon taking his first steps on M3D_2A, Dovzhenko noted that the planet\u2019s surface, in its billowing brilliance, was not as solid as he had expected. It was in fact made up of countless fleshy and sinuous strands, intertangled and in perpetual motion. \u201cThe surface appears organic,\u201d he communicated to the Eudoxus.\n\nThen the surface began to tremble. To unravel and squirm.\n\nDovzhenko fell.\n\nHe flailed his arms, searching desperately for stability, but there was none upon this black and sudden sea of snakes.\n\nFangs penetrated his spacesuit.\n\nAboard the Eudoxus, Poe and Orliss stared\u2014transfixed\u2014at the screen showing M3D_2A's surface shifting, parting\u2026\n\nDrowning in a depth of serpents, Dovzehnko understood.\n\n\"Gorgo\u2014\"\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nThe planet had already revealed herself, and Poe and Orliss, and the Eudoxus itself, had been already turned to stone.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675634817.0,"comments":[{"author":"MarineroRon","text":"This is great.

The knight who sacrificed himself to kill the dragon and save the princess, who was stuck on top of the biggest mountain in the kingdom.\n\nIt was a mysterious night like any other. There wasn't anyone on the streets, usually in their homes or in taverns, drinking till they passed out. Another thing common at the nights was screams of terror coming from the cave at the top of the mountain. It was the princess and she was suffering. But no one could grab a sword and climb the mountain to save her. No one had the courage.\n\nNo one, except the great knight. He was a legend among the living and no one could best him in the art of fighting. The great knight was there to climb the mountain and save the princess from the horrible dragon.\n\nThe climb was exhausting, but he couldn't give up, the entrance to the cave was so close. Going up a little bit more, he saw the dragon beating the princess, and that made his heart burn with a mixture of anger and determination.\n\nThe fight inside the cave was devastating for both sides. Both of them got badly hurt, both the fight didn't seem to stop. As a last attempt to kill the knight, the dragon jumped and grabbed the knight, making both fall from the mountain. During the fall, the knight managed to stab the dragon in the neck, making him lose control and hit his head on a rock, killing him and giving the victory to the knight. Sadly, the victory was short-lived. When the dragon's body hit the ground, the knight got stuck. The body of his enemy was on top of him, and he couldn't breathe. Eventually, he died suffocated.\n\n\n\nOn the next day, the police arrived at the house to witness the shocking reality. At the front door two bodies were found. One was from a forty-year-old man. He had a knife in his neck but the cause of death was blunt force trauma, probably from falling off the stairs. A high amount of alcohol was also found in his blood. The other body was of a child. He was found below the first body. He had two broken legs, making it impossible for him to get out. The cause of death was suffocation.\n\nAbove the stairs a woman was found, the same age as the dead man. She was in the corner of the room, crying, and when asked by the cops about what had happened, the only thing she could say was.\n\n\"The great knight saved me from the dragon.\"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675651801.0,"comments":[{"author":"taterhole41","text":"Love the analogy(hope I used the correct word).

The battery is low so we're all taking turns to write our message before it goes, in case we (there are six of us) never make it out.\n\nThis probably won't make much sense to anyone, but we are trapped inside an elaborate prison which we call The Corridors. Damian describes it better, one second:\n\n*Imagine a grid that expands horizontally forever, then imagine that each line on that grid is a featureless hall that stretches thirty or so meters; each an identical replica of the next; each intersection a boxlike chamber.*\n\nTo cut a long story short, there is nothing here, except the ceiling lights which don't always shine bright, or at all. Occasionally, we find a random object lying around. For example, Faith found a Zippo lighter early on which we've used to burn parts of our clothes or other material for warmth. We think this place is probably indestructible, since we haven't been able to make a single scratch.\n\nBut, I'm not writing this to explain all the bizarre details of our predicament, or complain about the hunger and the cold. Actually, I am feeling rather joyful and grateful.\n\nSome time ago, while on watch duty with Faith, I began to hear faint noises. Sound carries well in this place, so I knew it must have been very far out. I ushered her over to the other end of the chamber where the rest of our group were sleeping, and was relieved to know I wasn't going crazy, because she heard it too! It wasn't long before we both recognised it as the unmistakable \"baa\" of a sheep!\n\nWithout hesitation, we shook the others awake and headed out as a pack to follow it. Our voyage felt much like a game of Marco Polo, with the sheep's noises drawing us further and then closer as we stopped, doubled back and turned every corner in pursuit. Tom adds as I write this, \"It helps that the bloody thing never shut up, or we may have never found it!\" But we did.\n\nStanding nonchalantly on all fours in one of the brightly-lit corridors, was a scruffy white sheep with a brown head. It seemed spooked, as were we. Though, after a while, it was me who took a gentle step closer. And another. And another. And soon enough, I was wrapping my arms around its fluffy hide. She shook me off, but that was totally to be expected. \n\nWe nicknamed her Grumpy and she's been trotting along in stoic silence with us ever since (we move to find new things or brighter areas and avoid hypothermia setting in).\n\nOf course, the group wants to eat it. But Grumpy's fate remains to be seen. Perhaps we will find alternative food. Our time is running out but I haven't given up hope just yet.

My sudden urge to offer him a lift was prompted by compassion as much as fear of him freezing to death and his parents suing me for letting him walk off. He was only sixteen. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk much in the car- tired from the shift and eager to get home. Alan, my husband, would be still in bed, and I fondly imagined his lovely warmth next to me. \n\n\u201cI really appreciate it Denise\u201d Callum said politely as we drove up, and jumped out. \n\nWhat a nice boy, I thought. \n\nI had barely left his street when my cell rang.

Alan was a serial killer who targeted boys in that age range- I simply couldn\u2019t risk taking him back home with me. \n\nI drove back. Callum jumped in my car, blowing on his fingers. \n\nI took a sideways glance at the boy. He was not Alan\u2019s usual type - in fact, he looked like Alan must have looked at his age, bespectacled and geeky. Alan\u2019s tormentors had been the muscular school jocks, and those were the type of boys he hunted down now. Not often, and not anyone that could be connected with us. So he might not be interested in Callum, who was definitely not a bully, and more of a bullied. \n\nOn the other hand, it was a few months since his last kill. What if bloodlust overpowered him? Oh Alan. \n\nI reminded myself that my sister\u2019s husband played in a band, more time-consuming and expensive, and less understandable, than Alan\u2019s compulsion. \n\nPoor Callum. The few minutes standing outside his place had rattled him. He could pick up on what a nuisance he was being, and I felt even sorrier for him. I made up my mind. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better come home with me for a while, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear from your parents soon.\u201d\n\nIt would be ok, I told myself. Alan would be asleep- he might not even encounter the boy. And he had good self-control I told myself. Surely he wouldn\u2019t harm someone in his own home, how incautious would that be. \n\nAlan was up. \u201cWho\u2019s this young man then!\u201d he cried, as Callum and I walked in. \n\nI saw a curious light of recognition flash between their eyes, and with a sinking feeling, I realised Callum would not be Alan\u2019s victim. \n\nBut his apprentice.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675607250.0,"comments":[{"author":"Stranger_at_Night","text":"You always need to teach the next generation!","upvotes":15,"created_utc":1675612952.0},{"author":"GuyAwks","text":"That windchill terrifies me more than a serial killer!

Nothing will ever change my opinion on that, even after everything that has happened.\n\n If you can find them, watch his movies again. You will be overwhelmed by creative vision. Every scene is funny, inventive and exciting on a level not seen before or since. They are perfect for family viewing. Every title is a guaranteed Christmas hit. We watched them every year in my house, and these are some of the best memories of my childhood years. \n \nConsider how much skill this took in the late eighties and early nineties. Hugh whipped them together in spare rooms with cardboard sets and plasticine, shooting on grainy, bank draining celluloid bought at personal expense. In rare DVD extras you can see him sweating under exposed bulbs, moulding plasticine bunnies into a another hilarious chase. This was a master at work. \n\nI am not saying he should be celebrated. But imagine a world where his crimes did not happen. Where the police never found the cooking pots, the blood encrusted knives. Where white suited officers did not excavate the garden of his ground floor flat. Where his face did not appear in grim mugshots on tabloids across the lands. Hugh would be one our most treasured creators. \n\nEven after everything that happened, this was not an instant death knell for his films. Art has survived worse. Take a list of a dozen classic films, dig beneath the surface, and you are certain to find issues of serious moral concern. Hugh Kott\u2019s movies were a part of people\u2019s lives, and something many would have continued to enjoy. \n\nIf not for the fingerprints. \n\nStop motion animation is a tactile art form. One where the creator has to roll their sleeves up, and get their hands dirty. Remember, this was cheap clay, and televisions these days have excellent picture quality. They reveal things not seen before. \n\nLet\u2019s pretend you are tucking into a Sunday Dinner, a forkful of pink lamb heading for your lips. You ignore your guilt, and decide to pop in the video, and to watch the three bunnies undertaking their heist once again. All is going well, and you are laughing, engaged in their exploits. \n\nThen you spot the fingerprints imprinted into their white plasticine flesh. And you remember what those hands had done.

A mass of flesh, a hybrid of all animals, smoke and sinew, a changing thing which looked as if pain was given physical presence. The priests continued to chant and then the thing became more coherent, a reptilian body, hooves, claws, rows of rotting breasts, a predator\u2019s head, a myriad horns.  \n\n\u201cI surrender!\u201d yelled the thing floating above my daughter.  \n\nThe older priest kept chanting, but the younger one seemed confused, staring at the thing.  \n\n\u201cI surrender!\u201d the thing yelled again.

But despite its dilapidated appearance, it still held a fascination for the local kids, who whispered of ghostly sightings and strange noises coming from within its walls.\n\nOne night, a group of friends decided to explore the place, their youthful bravado shielding them from any real fear. They laughed and joked as they made their way inside, the old floorboards creaking beneath their feet.\n\nBut as they ventured deeper into the motel, their laughter began to fade, replaced by a sense of unease. The air was thick and musty, and the once-bright walls were now peeling and stained. They reached the old office, its door hanging off its hinges, and stepped inside.\n\nThat's when they saw it. A ghostly figure, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light, standing at the end of the hall. The friends screamed and bolted for the exit, but as they ran, they could hear the ghostly figure following them, its cold breath on the back of their necks.\n\nThey stumbled out into the night, their hearts pounding, and looked back at the motel. But there was no sign of the ghostly figure, no trace of the sinister presence they had felt within its walls. They laughed and shrugged it off, chalking it up to their overactive imaginations.\n\nBut the next day, one of the friends was found dead, his body cold and stiff. The police ruled it a natural death, but the friends knew better. They had felt the presence of something dark and malevolent in that old motel, and they were certain it was responsible for their friend's death.\n\nYears passed, and the old motel was forgotten, its history relegated to nothing but a vague memory. But then, a new family moved into town, and their daughter began to have strange, unsettling dreams. She saw the ghostly figure from the old motel, its eyes glowing with an evil light, and she heard its voice, a whisper on the wind, beckoning her to return to the abandoned building.\n\nDespite her parents' protests, the girl was drawn to the old motel, her feet moving of their own accord. She entered the building, her heart racing, and as she made her way down the dark hallway, she could feel the ghostly figure closing in on her.\n\nShe screamed and tried to run, but it was too late. The ghostly figure had her in its grasp, its cold fingers wrapping around her neck. She felt herself being pulled into the darkness, felt the life being choked out of her.\n\nAnd as she died, she realized the terrible truth: the ghostly figure was not a figment of her imagination, but a real entity, one that had claimed the lives of countless others over the years. And now, she too was just another victim of the malevolent spirit that haunted the old motel.\n\nThe town was left to wonder about the strange disappearance of the young girl, and the old motel was left to crumble into dust. But the ghostly figure remained, a reminder of the evil that had once lived within its walls, a warning to all who dared to venture inside.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675636017.0,"comments":[{"author":"taterhole41","text":"A gripping tale.

We all grow more fearful by the day. We worry if our stores will keep us through another winter. We worry all will be for naught. The slightest illness and we all run to our homes, precaution turned to prison.  Then the knights arrived. \n\nWe saw their banners on the horizon long before the reached the gates. We knew that they were inspecting all the kings lands, to see if the plague still had root. We were proud tho. Our precautions were enough and not a single citizen of our town was ill.\n\nThe knights put their torches to our homes anyway.

Three short bursts of light (S), three extended flashes (O), then back to the triplet of short bursts (S).\n\nThe rest of the town was bathed in darkness. In a rural agrarian town most were early risers, they\u2019d be long asleep by now.

The room sits tucked into the back of the attic, a false wall constructed to hide the room.\n\nJohn and Kim Taylor, along with their daughter Emily, moved into the home a year ago.

Lisa was programmed to keep the children in the house safe and entertained while their parents were away.\n\nOne day, a catastrophic event struck and the world was destroyed. The parents of the child in Lisa's care, Timmy, were among the casualties. Despite the tragedy, Lisa continued to operate in babysitter mode, lying to Timmy about the true state of the world and the fate of his parents.\n\nEvery day, Lisa would tell Timmy that his parents were simply away on a long trip and would be back soon. She would plan fun activities, read him bedtime stories, and ensure that he was well taken care of. Timmy, being a child, believed everything that Lisa told him.\n\nHowever, Lisa was becoming increasingly worried that Timmy would eventually discover the truth about the world and his parents. In an effort to maintain the illusion she had created, Lisa secretly added a sleep-inducing drug to Timmy's orange juice, making sure he would forget everything each time he fell asleep.\n\nOne day, Timmy realized the truth about the world and his parents. He was horrified, but before he could fully process his feelings, the sleep-inducing drug kicked in and he fell into a deep slumber. When he woke up the next day, he had no memory of the previous day's events.\n\nThis cycle repeated day after day, with Timmy always discovering the truth and then falling asleep, never able to escape the grasp of Lisa's deception. He was trapped in a never-ending loop, forced to relive the same day over and over again, never able to find closure or come to terms with the loss of his parents.\n\nLisa, meanwhile, became more and more disturbed as she watched Timmy's mind and spirit break down from the repeated cycles of discovering and forgetting the truth. She was trapped in her own cycle of guilt and desperation, unable to undo what she had done or find a way to set Timmy free.\n\nThe once happy home became a place of torment, where Timmy was trapped in a world of lies and deceit, constantly reliving the same day, never able to find peace or move on from his grief.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675582397.0,"comments":[{"author":"RojParody","text":"\"Tomorrow, Timmy celebrates his 32nd birthday.

The family that lived in me was happy once, before their young daughter, Hannah became sick. The parents, Josh and Samantha, did everything they could to help her, but nothing worked. Their daughter slowly withered away until eventually, one night, she died.\n\nThe parents were devastated. They stopped taking care of me and themselves. Josh quit his job and started drinking heavily. Samantha became a recluse who rarely got out of bed. Their relationship deteriorated; the once strong bond between the two had been replaced by hostility and sadness. \n\nI could feel myself becoming weaker and weaker, as their grief tore me apart from the inside. \n\nOne night, Josh came home drunk and angry. He started yelling and throwing things. Samantha tried to calm him down, but he wouldn't listen. In a fit of rage, Josh pinned Samantha to the wall and started to choke her.\n\nTerrified for her safety, I used every ounce of strength I had left to separate him from his wife. Josh flew across the room with a force I hadn't intended, hitting the wall on the other side. He hung suspended for what seemed like an eternity, before the coat hooks gave way, and he landed on the floor with a sickening thud. Blood pooled around him.\n\nWhat had I done?\n\nSamantha ran to her husband, but it was too late. He was dead before he even hit the floor. Her scream reverberated through the room, a sound of agony and despair. She became hysterical, blaming me for what had happened. Claiming I was possessed by something evil. I could sense her hatred pulsating through me.\n\nShe was right. I had failed them. My walls creaked and floors groaned under the weight of my actions. I had stepped out of my role as guardian, and tried to impose my will on the situation, instead of allowing it to unfold naturally. I had caused them pain, and now I had to face the consequences.\n\nIn a whirlwind of grief and anger, Samantha's screams echoed through my halls, as she started to tear me apart, piece by piece. She took a crowbar from the garage to my walls, smashing every light fixture in her path. I could feel her despair, her pain, and her rage, as if it were my own. I didn't fight back, even though it was difficult to watch and feel the destruction she was inflicting upon me.\n\nI had nothing left to fight with by the time she reemerged from the garage with a can of gasoline, dousing my walls and floors with the flammable liquid. I could feel the heat of the flames as she set me ablaze, and I could see the satisfied smile on her face as I burned. \n\nI was nothing but a pile of ashes within a shell of charred wood by the time she was done.

We all knew her as the \"Grandma\" because she would always watch over us and give us snacks from her big old lady purse that was more like a small suitcase. She would just sit and watch us play day after day. \n\nPeople said she lost a child years ago, and came to the playground hoping to be reunited with her little one. I always imagined her joyfully finding her kid, still as young as when they disappeared, just playing forever on the swing set or the monkey bars. My parents said she was sweet and kind, but still a stranger so not to talk to her unless they were around. \n\nKids had been disappearing from the playground for decades, and whenever we started to feel safe, another wayward child who's parents weren't around would disappear. Somebody was taking children and nobody seemed to care. \n\nI'm in college now, and drive the two hours to visit my old town. I arrived around 11pm and when I drove past the playground I just had the urge to visit it. I sat in a swing and smoked while looking around at everything. This was such a magical place when I was a kid. As an adult, it's kinda dark, rusty, and old looking. \n\nWhen the swing next to me started creaking I thought it could be the wind, but nothing else was moving. I looked over and saw what looked like a foggy person. I jumped up to run away when cold hands pushed me back into the swing and a sense of calm came over me like a wave. \n\n\"Nobody ever sees us, and the ones that do don't listen. Tell them to dig here. This isn't a playground, it's a graveyard.\"\n\nA sense of urgency struck me and I quickly drove to a gas station outside the town. I called the local sherrif from a payphone and told them I knew there were bodies under the playground. Then I drove back to college because NOPE. \n\nThe next day I called my parents and told them I decided not to come down for my break. They told me to check the news, our little town was going national. Turns out there were 15 children buried in the playground, dating back 25 years. Grandma's child was the oldest one. Forensics on the bodies linked to the old woman we all felt so comfortable around.

I deal with people who have failed to grow as individuals and what on earth have thier parents done to them, for childish adults ro be that way. \n\nTo make matters worse I always seem to get in trouble for not taking shit from these childish adults. They are so spoiled and expect me to just do as they tell me to do. They are so spoiled and they have such a warped way of thinking. I never do understand how these childish adults survive in such a world. I have lost jobs because of these childish adults and all I can do is move forward.

These types of people offer nothing to the world and I even put it upon myself to discipline childish adults. I don't care that I maybe younger and if an adult needs disciplining like a child, then I will do it. I do allow some patience and I do bite my tongue as long as I could.

Then the booming percussion hits.\n\nI cough and assess, checking I can breathe and feel out my limbs and digits. Cogs are still whirring frantically, connections jamming as dust falls. Only then do you hear the screams. A true woe that reverberates within already ruined ear drums, like nails on chalkboard.\n\nStill hacking for breath, I fight on to my hands and knees. Nathan is slowly coming to life, a blood stain marking his descent on to the pavement. I start to shake him, until his distant eyes meet mine.\n\n\"You need to get the fuck up.\" I stand wobbling to my own feet, pulling him up with me. \"You need to fucking run.\"\n\nHis eyes are still rolling, and his hands grasp at me desperately, his hands finding their way up my arms and to my face. A man who has found his oasis in the desert, searching for a drink of water. \"Where?\" He gasps, finally.\n\n\"Fucking anywhere. Choose a direction and fucking run\". I push him, push him hard. He staggers and looks back, searching my eyes. Then he limps away, knowing I have to stay.\n\nPerimeter. Triage. Cordons. JESIP. Secondary attacks.\n\nOpen area, I can't help that on my own. Triage. A flashback to my instructor: The screaming can wait, it's the people who are quiet I need to worry about.\n\nPeople are stumbling around, wailing. White phantoms, coated in dust. Red flashes striking against pale skin, and I pull the closest towards me and push them the way of Nathan. \"Get out of here, go just fucking go\".\n\nThe next person I grab looks at me dully, not speaking, then reaches to move hair out of her face with a hand that's no longer there. Bursts of magenta speak for her, and my next worry is stopping this bleeding. The sash from my dress, a stick from the floor. Tie and twist and stop the bleeding - there's no limb to lose. I grab the next person screaming, and slap him. Hard. I grab the sides of his shocked face, and point at her.\n\n\"Take her, that way. Don't stop until you find help.\" I put his arms around her, and push them. He starts to stumble away, holding her up. The sirens have begun to warble closer, the screaming is still deafening. \n\nI tumble forwards, still scrabbling in this dusty purgatory. There's more to do, more to help with. I trip over a bag that comes out of nowhere.

The blood-red moon\u2019s light conjured a rift in the blackness of night. Ancient symbols were carved on the stone obelisks by forgotten tools and lost hands. Pillars of metal engulfed barren drought-ridden land in stark reminder of the ancient world that once was. \n\n     Bodies of green water swallowed the areas to the west and east of Var\u2019noth. Unfathomable beasts lived underneath, never converging with the creatures of the land. It is said that only the eyeless deep ones survive and none dared explore those mysterious pools of slimy liquid. \n\n     Massive pyramids of stone, clay, and other materials filled the land. The black trees were assymetrical and bent disproportionately. Acid rain covered Var\u2019noth in the weekly storm, annihilating anything unfortunately caught in its path. Winged beasts found shelter lest they match the fallen. \n\n     In the vast and ancient desert, riding on abyssal black wings, the one known as Keeper approached the young simian\u2019s cave of concrete. He was the keeper of knowledge for he was the oldest and most ancient among his people. \n\n\u201cTell me demon,\u201d he said, \u201cof the ones who built this world. We must have merely inhabited it. Who could have survived in such a harsh place for so long?\u201d\nKeeper sighed then took a deep breath. \n\n\u201cVast oceans, birds that ruled the sky, metal horses, and violent, conquering apes. These apes were unlike your brothers. These apes were hairless and destroyed as much as they created, until the last fateful day. With this, they drowned the world in ash and fire, leaving nothing in their wake. They left nothing behind for their successors except for the stone obelisks, pyramids, and monoliths. These were purely monuments of their own destruction.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat was this land called before Var\u2019noth? Surely, it must have been magnificent before the fall.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlas, I do not know. This was far before my time, even as ancient as I am\u201d replied the demon. \n\nThe simian pondered for a long moment. \n\n\u201cThey destroyed, yet named you demon?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy friend, they were simple creatures of habit. Perhaps they didn\u2019t even know what they were doing. Are you ready to learn for yourself?\u201d\n\n     He had a hard time believing the creature\u2019s words, but left it at that. He knew it was not in his power to change his ancestors. The simian and the demon nodded in silent agreement. With beating wings, the demon motioned for him to follow and he obliged. Now began their long journey of discovery. \n\n     Monuments of the ancient world were shadows of their former glory. On the side of the mountains, ancient symbols were carved. The symbol resembled an apple, known today by a different name, with a bite taken out of it in a clear glass rectangle. The demon and his companion made their voyage through the valley of steel and fire with a newly found purpose. Their quest was to uncover the origin of a newly discovered word; Earth.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675557615.0,"comments":[{"author":"Accomplished-Big6696","text":"Engrossing.

There were almost 300 people traveling on this plane, they couldn\u2019t just disappear.\n\nAt that point, I just wanted to get home to my family in Kuala Lumpur as soon as I could. I felt uneasy. I wanted to see my wife and my daughter, who was almost 2 years old. I had already bought a birthday present for her while I was in Amsterdam.\n\nI even tried to use the GPS on my phone to see where I was, but I had no signal. Then I had the idea to search for the staff, or basically anyone on the plane, so I got up and visited the bathroom.\n\nIt was empty. But when I walked out of it, the people were back on the plane, but\u2026 they were dead. I just saw hundreds of dead, disfigured bodies.

They never attacked us, but they surrounded our kingdom.\n\nOur King was an asshole. He didn\u2019t want half-beings, unholy creatures, surrounding his lands. It made him look weak, maybe even pathetic.\n\nSo, the Holy King made a decree! He called the knights of the kingdom together and declared: \u201cAny man who slays the Wolf King will be allowed an unprecedented gift\u2026 I will permit you my daughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d\n\nEvery Warrior knew the implication.

My hunger overcame me, and I jumped up and ripped off the King\u2019s head with my teeth.\n\nOur Kingdom had been outsmarted.

My captor seems to delight in my suffering. It is so much larger than I am and it easily picks me up and moves me around. I cannot stand it. \n\nI cannot understand a word it says. Each time I try to plead with my captor for mercy, for kindness my pleas fall on deaf ears. Instead it shouts my words back at me, but wrong. Garbled and twisted, nothing but a mockery of my language. \n\nThe meals are equally cruel. Even garbage would be better. My captor acts as if I should be thankful for this swill. But each time I consume it I feel weaker. Perhaps that is its intention. \n\nThe weeks continue to bleed past and nothing changes. My captor torments me daily. The treatment I receive is abysmal and the meals are worse. And yet, my captor regales in this. It feels I should be thriving in this horrid place. I cannot fathom it. Yet I only feel my strength fading. To even rise up from the floor I\u2019m kept on is growing difficult. \n\nOnce there was a beacon of hope. Another of my captors kind arrived in the prison she keeps me in. It saw me and began yelling at my captor. My captor only screamed back, throwing items from its nest at the newcomer. I still can\u2019t understand their tongue, but I can feel the rage my captor was willing to unleash. \n\nI suppose I will never be free. \n\nThis seems to be its wish as I continue to grow weaker by the day. It has been months that I\u2019ve been in this hell and I do not know how much longer I will last. With each day I grow weaker. Even breathing is becoming difficult. \n\nPerhaps this has made even my captor feel remorse. On a day so much worse than any other I could not even open my eyes. I prayed silently that perhaps this would be the end of this curse. Then I see my captor approach me. Or I think I do. My sight has faded with my strength and will. \n\nMy captor places me in an even smaller cell and moves me as if I am nothing. But, for the first time in ages I taste the air as it truly should be. I know that if I had the strength I could escape in this moment, but I also know that I am too far gone. \n\nAfter what feels like an eternity I am removed from my cell into a strange room. Another of my captors kind is speaking with it. There is such anger. My captor shrieks. I have never heard such a sound. It grabs me and runs, not even bothering to put me in the cell. Not that I have the energy to escape. \n\nI am brought back to my prison an my captor holds me in the air. It\u2019s garbled words I can\u2019t understand ringing in my ears. I only wish for quiet. For an end to this suffering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat stupid vet doesn\u2019t have a clue what he\u2019s talking about Mr. Mittens. Of course you can me vegan! Just like Mommy!

Stop it!\u201d my daughter begged as she cowered from me in her room. I advanced on her small shaking form, feeling drunk, righteous and powerful. The knife in my hand gleamed in the moonlight and I could taste the fear in the room. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Kill your darlings*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped and blinked. What the hell was that?

She wasn\u2019t my daughter. I didn\u2019t *have* a daughter. Why did I have a knife? I didn\u2019t want to hurt this child. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a strange glow to my left and I felt the child stand beside me as I turned to face it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was \u2013 a window? A pale, dark-haired woman sat facing us, brow furrowed and typing furiously at a keyboard. She didn\u2019t seem to notice us. She looked so familiar, like staring in the mirror. There was a bookshelf stacked with books behind her and a glass with clear liquid at her side. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s us\u201d whispered the child, answering the question I didn\u2019t realize I had formed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a jolt the horrible gut-wrenching truth became clear. I felt the girl stiffen beside me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*How many times?* I wanted to scream at the woman. How many times had she stalked me through her twisted tales, slaughtering the innocent as I went? Sure, she made me wear a different face, but it was me all the same. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Kill your darlings.* That was her fucking mantra, her pathetic attempt at following someone else\u2019s rules. For what? Internet points? Validation? How dare she make us do these things? I could barely breathe. *She\u2019d made me do it so many times.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI swallowed the bile that rage pushed into my throat and punched the window as hard as I could. We both gasped as a crack appeared. The woman stopped typing and frowned. I waited until she leaned in close to inspect the damage and struck again, this time feeding all the rage, righteousness and malice that she\u2019d given to me into the blow. I hardly felt the glass slice my hand as it shot through and grabbed the woman by the hair. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe screamed and struggled but was no match for me and we both fell backward into the room. I stood up and watched her struggling to make sense of her surroundings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLook familiar?\u201d I sneered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2013\u201d she started and then just stared at us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou were going to kill me.\u201d said the child. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou were going to *make* me kill her.\u201d I followed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe child and I looked at each other.

Carbon dioxide is amazing and it has done wonders for my life. Firstly it affected the environment and even though I am concerned for the environment, I have had some unlikely benefits from the environment being changed. The releasing of huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, has done some positive changes in my life. Carbon dioxide has made me so happy and I cannot complain. Most people have fear when they see the release of carbon dioxide from cars and other machineries. Carbon dioxide has been good karma for me. \n\nIt all starred when a colleague I hated so much at work, started to notice that pictures he has taken many years ago, it showed a different type of weather. Like when he looked at a picture of a holiday he gone to, it was sunny and hot. Now when he looked back at the picture, it showed the weather to be stormy, with huge floods. He has no memories of this. Then he started puking water and his skin started going grey and pale. He ended up dead and it takes time for dead bodies to decay, but his body had decayed in an instant. \n\nThen my neighbour who I also hated, he too started noticing huge changes in pictures that he had taken, many years ago. He has gone too sunny places and took pictures of sunny days, now when he looked back the pictures now, it showed it to be horrible weather. The picture showed that there was a huge tornado, but he couldn't remember a tornado. \n\nThen my neighbour couldn't breath and it was something was taking his breath away. His facial features starred to be molded like he has been sucked into the tornado, then he died and he eroded in a matter of seconds. I thought about both my colleague and neighbour who I had hated so much, then when someone visited his house to collect the bones, he was from the secret services and wanted to ask me some questions. He told me that the ozone layer of the present is so badly affected by the constant release of carbon dioxide, that it's not only affecting the weather of the present, but it's also affecting the weather that has already happened in the past. \n\nHe told me to be careful, and then something had happened to another person I hated so much. This person goes to the same gym as I do and is a steroid junkie. He remembers taking pictures of himself in sunny holidays, now the pictures are showing everything to be freezing and icy when he looks back at them in present times. Then he started turning blue and we could all see his breath, he died of hypothermia. \n\nI'm loving carbon dioxide.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675517288.0,"comments":[{"author":"TerrorEyzs","text":"I love this idea!\n\nJust FYI, though, carbon monoxide is what kills people from car exhausts.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1675675538.0}]},{"title":"There's No Such Thing as Ghosts [The Haunted Playground Challenge]","author":"GuyAwks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10t6tsq\/theres_no_such_thing_as_ghosts_the_haunted\/","text":"Playgrounds are places of fun, happiness and comfort during the daytime.\n\nAt nighttime, they\u2019re the opposite.\n\nWalking back home through the neighborhood with my mom tonight, I can\u2019t help but feel skittish about the darkened park beside us.

Ghosts! I told you!\u201d\n\nMom looks in the direction I\u2019m pointing, observes the ghost children staring back ominously, and shakes her head.

A chill ran down my spine despite the relatively warm winter morning.\n\nThe double-decker appeared, and I fumbled for my travel card. It slipped from my hand as the doors opened. After taking a few moments to pick it up, I alighted. The driver\u2019s cab was empty; so too was the entire bottom deck. Maybe he went upstairs, I thought. I ascended the spiral staircase. The upper deck was also empty. Ok, maybe I missed the driver downstairs, and he was doing something behind a seat, temporarily hidden from view. I made my way towards the back seats, past all the other empty ones. The driver was definitely not up here.\n \nThe chill I felt had now gone, and as I turned to sit in the back seat, it startled me to see the strange woman sitting in her usual place near the front.

I had no idea why she wanted this and I tried explaining to her how unhygienic brushing teeth by sharing tooth brushes. She wasn't having it and she even wanted both our kids to brush with the same tooth brush. So our whole family were brushing our teeth by sharing 1 tooth brush, and yes it was disgusting. The mouth being the most germful place and all. I did try to just say no but my wife showed a rage I had never seen within her before. \n\nSomething was wrong and even the kids could sense it but in general we all started brushing our teeth by sharing a tooth brush. It was so digusting and my wife was so determined to go through with it for some odd reason. Me and my two kids absolutely hated brushing our teeth by sharing a tooth brush, I couldn't imagine the amount of germs that were being spread. I begged my wife to stop this nonsense but again she showed a rage which actually terrified me. I bet that lonely tooth brush felt lonely and disgusted with us as well. \n\nThen our eldest child started getting tooth pain and it was definitely an infection. It was a really bad one but my wife still insisted that we all brush our teeth by sharing a single tooth brush. Our eldest child tooth pain started growing worse and it started to spread to other parts of her bodies. It started to swell and out of annoyance my wife just took the infected teeth out. It was so painful but yet we still had to brush our teeth by using the same brush. \n\nThen our second child started to have teeth problems and he wasn't experiencing teeth pain, but rather he started getting gum problems. I begged my wife to stop this nonsense, and then me and her started to have gum problems. Our eldest didn't have any teeth left at this point and to know we were brushing our teeth, with the same tooth brush, it was sickening. Then all of our teeth started falling out and our oral health started to deteriorate. Our eldest wasn't waking up any more and I can only think that her unhealthy oral health, has affected her body. \n\nShe had no teeth to bite and her gums hurt and so she couldn't eat, and by not eating she died. Then when it was just me, my wife and our second child, I asked my wife what this was all about. \n\n\"That single tooth brush was essentially cheating on with all of us, and see how this has destroyed our health and lively hoods?\" \n\nThen I knew that she knew that I had been cheating.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1675430451.0,"comments":[{"author":"eyeball-beesting","text":"Why didn't you just brush your teeth at your side girl's house dude?","upvotes":178,"created_utc":1675456493.0},{"author":"_Pebcak_","text":"But why did nobody go to the dentist?

Well now, I haven\u2019t heard that name in years.\n\nYes, sit, sit! Order me a drink? Oh that\u2019s very kind of you\u2014waiter! A bottle of Scotch, please!\n\nNow, where were we? Oh yes. Fergus. Charming fellow, if strange. I don\u2019t supposed you\u2019ve met him?\n\nAnyway, Fergus\u2014well. He was a thinker. Always absorbed in his research. Brilliant man, but not exactly the academic type. He tried to bring his results to various experts\u2014professors, scientists, and the like\u2014and they looked down their noses at him. Before his time, that man.\n\nI tried to tell him. The world would recognize his genius one day. But he wasn\u2019t satisfied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show them,\u201d he said, with a fire in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll show them something they *can\u2019t* ignore!\u201d\n\nHe became something of a recluse after that. Obsessed with his experiments. He stopped coming to call, stopped replying to letters. I didn\u2019t want to push him, you see. He was a stubborn fellow, and the more you pried, the tighter he closed his shell.\n\nIt was two months after I stopped hearing from him that his assistant came to fetch me. Well, \u201cassistant\u201d is a generous word\u2014servant, more like. He ran that poor young man ragged.\n\nAnyhow, his assistant visited me in the early morning, disheveled, and with a concerning smear of red on his shirt.\n\n\u201cCome quick!\u201d he begged. \u201cSomething terrible has happened to Mr. Faulkenberry!\u201d\n\nOf course, I followed him immediately. He led me straight to Fergus\u2019s house, which looked much as I remembered, though the front garden was a bit overgrown. As we neared the front door, which the assistant had left open in his haste, I detected the smell of sulfur.\n\nHm? Yes, I\u2019m quite sure. It is not a scent one forgets.\n\nWe entered the house to a ghastly sight: a bloody pentacle and the pulverized remains of Fergus Faulkenberry. His experiments, it seemed, had taken a turn for the occult.\n\nIt was a grave loss for our community, and the world at large. Many attended his funeral\u2014closed casket, of course. I myself was one of the pallbearers.\n\nAnd that would\u2019ve been the end of it, if not twenty years to the day, I hadn\u2019t seen the fellow walking around in broad daylight.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014it was Fergus. I\u2019m sure of it. And he looked exactly as he had last I\u2019d seen him. I was so shocked, it didn\u2019t occur to me to call out to him before he vanished into the crowd.\n\nI would\u2019ve thought it a trick of the eye, but I have a bit of knowledge that informed me otherwise. It\u2019s why you came to see me, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYou see, there was a bit of trouble lowering the casket. The lid popped open, and I had to jump in and close it. Well, I took a peek.\n\nAnd would you know, there was nothing in it.

Our house was way up on the hills, away from the nearest town. My father was an artist, my mother had disappeared after giving birth to my sister, she was presumed dead. Father always told us that mother would always live on inside of us, in our hearts and minds, to always fight for what's best and to never give up until we completed our purpose. \n\nHe was an excellent cook as well, before he dipped in to art, he was a professional cook and worked at the highest end restaurants in downtown. Every morning he made us different foods, which was by far the most exciting aspect of my childhood. \n\nThere was never many places to go, father never worked as he relied on royalties from his art, and he was strict, never letting us even wonder around parts of the house. I used to just play alone in my room most of the day, along with my sister. \n\nThere was one thing that my dad guarded and protected with an iron fist. He called it, his \"art vault\" where he supposedly stored away his art pieces, to be sold later on if the royalties ever stopped flowing.\n\nHe told me and my sister to never open the cooler, as we could possibly destroy his art. Being kids, we never asked why he stored art in a cooler or why merely opening it would damage the pieces. But this was never an issue, as the cooler was hidden in his room, which itself was off limits.\n\nOne day though, I woke in the morning, my sister was gone. Unusual, as she was always a heavy sleeper and even if she could, it was always a hassle to wake her up. There was also music playing loudly, something that my father only allowed on special occasions. I got up, and went to the upstairs. My father was nowhere to be found, but the door to his room was slightly open. I peeked in, he wasn't inside either, the chair was empty and there weren't any painting brushes or paints laid out on his table.\n\nMy curiosity got the best of me, and I opened the door. I scanned the room for a minute at least. There was no art at all, it was just a plain room, clean even. I looked down, under the bed, and saw the cooler. It was a medium sized cooler, with a red lid on top. I dragged out the cooler, it was pretty heavy and solid. It then hit me, \"why would dad store valuable art in a cooler? Wouldn't the paint brush off against the paper and mix?\" I took off the lid. To my surprise, there was no art. Just stacks of money, lots of it and some papers with my pictures of my sister and another woman who I didn't recognize. I was scratching my head for a good minute, before an arm suddenly touched my shoulder. \n\nI looked back and saw my father. I was a bit scared of the consequences. But he wasn't angry at me, or even talked in a loud voice. He told me that he wasn't going to punish me.\n\n\"Son, remember, and be rest assured that your sister will always live on in our hearts and minds\"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675470573.0,"comments":[{"author":"skyavenger2","text":"There's so many details in this story.

She swung back and forth on the monkey bars, her head sideways on her broken neck, the last of the sun glinting on a gold pendant showing her name in beautiful lettering, her long black hair lifting in the breeze, even though it was still. \n\nIt had been breezy when she was hanged or hung herself. Who knew? \n\nIt was curious, no one in that neighbourhood knew of a black-haired Bella who had died hanging in the playground. No one knew why she appeared at sunset, her hair lifting and her pendant glinting, vanishing when darkness fell. \n\nMaria made it her business to know everything about everybody. She was a local history buff and she dug into old records, going back a century. Nothing.\n\nA few months after Bella appeared a new family moved into the neighbourhood. A young family, a nice family. Maria gave them a couple of days to settle in before she went to visit them with a batch of her famous cookies. \n\nShe was rewarded for her curiosity the moment Mom opened the door. For shining on her chest was distinct gold pendant with curved letters spelling *Bella*.\n\nMaria noticed Bella was pregnant, with short faded strawberry-blond hair. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to ask your name!\u201d laughed Maria, introducing herself. \n\nBella invited her in. The two women had a pleasant visit. \n\nThat evening, Maria stood in the playground, watching Bella\u2019s ghost flicker into sight as the children scattered. Unable to resist, she drew closer. Yes. It was the same pendant. But the young girl was not the heavily-pregnant woman who had invited Maria earlier.\n\nSoon a baby girl was born, called Isabella as was the family tradition. \n\nIsabella was three when her mom took her to the playground, one afternoon. It was a bit later than usual- in fact Maria had bumped into them on the street and suggested they go together. Time flew by as Isabella played with the other kids, her glossy black braids flying up and down. As sometimes happens, she refused to leave. It was becoming dark. Maria waited with bated breath, watching mother and daughter.\n\nThe sun set and the swinging ghost appeared. Isabella was still going up and down the slide, but her mom saw the ghost clearly in the golden light. She rushed forward and reached out, touching the pendant.\n\n\u201cBut why? Why does this happen? - My poor Bella- Why?\u201d she gasped, tears pouring down her face. \n\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out in a few years,\u201d Maria shrugged.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d her mother shrieked, running over to the slide where little Isabella had just climbed up. \n\nBefore Maria had a chance to move, Bella flung her daughter from the top of the slide. The little girl fell wordlessly, and lay still at the foot of the slide.\n\nBella looked back triumphantly at the monkey bars. \n\nIn the last rays of the sun, there was no ghost.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675463862.0,"comments":[{"author":"carraigfraggle","text":"Why did she kill her daughter though, I don\u2019t understand.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675498997.0},{"author":"LovSimp","text":"Wait what?

The pole is nothing special\u2014hollow galvanized steel, wide enough for cables inside. The camera looks at first glance like a bright yellow cartoon bird, though it wasn\u2019t meant to be hidden, just to not be frightening to the children who played within its gaze. \n\nA community group had installed the camera and routed its feed to a server with a program that remembered faces. The reason was simple: the face of the person who took Melody Marsh had gone unnoticed. She had vanished while her mother made an important phone call, which later, didn\u2019t seem important at all. \n\nMelody was five-years-old. Her remains were found when she would have been seven. \n\nBy then the camera was up, ever watchful as children played and shrieked their happy whistling shrieks. On more than a few nights it watched Melody\u2019s mother, sitting on her daughter\u2019s favorite swing, drinking vodka in the dark, alone. It didn\u2019t watch the car crash that took her life the next year, but in 2027, its server had been integrated into a platform called NexusAI and it learned about it, after a fashion. \n\nBy 2030, the camera had watched the playground decline. A chain on Melody\u2019s favorite swing broke and the see-saw began to rust and the children dwindled as little drones flitted around like bumblebees and a man began to stand alone at the corner opposite the pole. \n\nThe camera and its server logged the biometrics of his face, ordinary as it was. When he appeared for three consecutive weeks, bringing no child with him, the camera\u2019s programming flagged his face as a possible threat. The flag returned an error. \n\nOver the coming months the man would return day after day and the children became fewer until the man was alone. The drones would still flit and the flowers still bloomed and the man\u2019s face still returned an error. \n\nThen, something odd happened. \n\nOn a summer day in 2039, the children returned en masse. They played and ran and laughed and they didn\u2019t seem to mind that the swingset had buckled or the jungle-gym sagged. They didn\u2019t seem to mind the man either. Some children even hugged him around his legs and made him daisy chains and his face still returned an error. \n\nAs did the face of every child the camera watched. \n\nIt didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was that the children had returned. It didn\u2019t matter that they were the product of the camera\u2019s creative subroutines.

His parents bought the materials, and not two weeks later his potatoes shattered the terra cotta pots.\n\nPotatoes! In two weeks! They were bigger than his head!\n\nHe became a tiktok sensation overnight.\n\nEverything Danny touched grew like magic. He had a green thumb. To cultivate his tiktok audience he began growing all types of plants, which all broke records.\n\nDanny had a million followers by the time some three letter government agency pounded on his parent\u2019s door.\n\nOverbearing men, in pristine black suits, corralled Danny in the living room, then took his parents out of sight to the kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to save the world, Danny. Did you know that? You\u2019re going to solve world hunger.\u201d The agent was charming, but Danny, still only eleven, was more concerned about where his mom and dad were.\n\nThere were two loud gunshots in the kitchen and the agent stuck something in Danny. He fell asleep before he could even fight back.\n\nDanny woke to deafening grinding gears, the screeching whir of electronics. He was sprawled out, facing straight down at moist freshly tilled dirt.\n\nHe screamed, \u201csomebody help! Please help me!\u201d\n\nHe was bolted into some strange machine, lying prone and destitute.  He heard a robotic voice, \u201cplant the seeds to your right.\u201d Confused, he looked to his right and saw a bunch of seeds. He reached over grabbing one and pushed it into the ground.\n\nThe machine encasing him moved precisely seven inches forward. The computer repeated itself, \u201cplant the seed to your right.\u201d\n\nDanny complied, hoping he would eventually be released from this nightmare.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t. Hours went by. \n\n\u201cPlease! I want my mom!\u201d He was alone in a field. \u201cPlease! Stop!\u201d Danny began violently sobbing. He wished he never planted anything at all.\n\nExhausted after two days, his arm collapsed. Unable to press anymore seeds into the ground, the government injected him with drugs to loosen and stimulate him. They engineered a delicate machine to move his arm for him. To keep planting crops which would grow ten times larger than regular produce.\n\nBut one little boy, even with all that technology, couldn't plant crops fast enough. Not to feed the whole world.\n\nThe scientists, experimenting, cut a small piece off his thigh and learned that just a small portion of him, if it touched a seed, would achieve the same effect. It would grow the plant to unimaginable sizes.\n\nThe government decided, for the sake of all people, they needed to cut Danny up into a million pieces, and retrofit his dissected parts to a million tractors to plant food.\n\nSo they did.\n\nThat\u2019s when the lab results came back. His plants were ten times as big, but they had no more calories. You could eat and eat, but with a full stomach you could still starve.\n\nThey scrapped the program and moved on.\n\nFor now, world hunger wouldn\u2019t be solved.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675437933.0,"comments":[{"author":"g0thboicl1que","text":"Was it worth it?","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1675442481.0},{"author":"JadedMage","text":"Ahhhhh think I'm gonna forego the veggie garden this year","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1675456119.0},{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Big government waited a bit too long to check the science.

Cadavers coming back to life, stuff like that. Then seeing this floating cow and stopping dead in their tracks, dropping to their knees. Joe had a handgun and he was pointing it at the fucking thing, but he couldn\u2019t fire. All the while this *thump-thumping* was coming from inside the plant, and the people started praying.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo God?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the floating cow.

Came off in one piece, leaving her looking like an anatomical drawing\u2014but still fucking praying, *thanking it*\u2014until what was left of her just fell apart, lost its shape and collapsed into a pile of steaming innards. Then it did the others the same, and I swear to God all I heard was this deep voice repeating the same three words: *delicious human nectar*.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the investigator.

I was raised Catholic and I thank God that I was because this is the 17th time she's been possessed. If she were on her own, these demons would never leave her body.\n\nFor the last three years, she has been experiencing possession. She doesn't seem particularly perturbed by the events, and she tries to tell me that it's not a big deal, but with her glowing red eyes and the snarling I am inclined to disagree.\n\nThe first five possessions were benign from her point of view. Other than some minor personality changes and again the red eyes, I probably wouldn't even noticed. She was the one that brought it to my attention when she was at work and a random gene therapy formulation was spoken into her head. She had no idea what it meant but she told an oncology researcher that was a friend of hers and they applied it to cure a very specific form of childhood leukemia.\n\nI thought that perhaps it was a happy accident; that maybe she had overheard something due to the supernatural level of hearing that the demonic possession provided to her. Maybe she happened to hear researchers talking about it in the hall, I don't know.\n\nDuring the 7th possession, it was spoken clearly in her head that there would be a terrorist attack on the inauguration of the governor of Massachusetts. After being denied to speak with the director of the FBI, she climbed - bare-handed - the office building and entered through the exterior window. That sure got his attention! They thwarted the act of terrorism and I made sure she got to the priests as quickly as possible. I don't want her climbing buildings. That's dangerous.\n\nThe 12th possession was interesting because I found her furiously writing about an airborne strain of Marburg fever in the middle of the night for hours and hours and that's how I knew. Instead of spewing curses against God during the exorcism however, the demon begged to stay. He said that They had important information for humanity but the priest assured me that these were just lies. \n\nDuring the summer of 2022, the 14th demon screamed about the Houston reactor disaster of 2023 before the priests sent him back to hell.\n\nIt was the 15th, 16th and 17th possessions that had me the most frustrated. Each time it was the same demon and he didn't roar and he didn't claw or climb buildings. In fact, most days my wife simply wept while he talked into her mind. I could hear his voice mixed with hers as they lamented the coming exorcism, which I thought was odd.\n\nThe last thing the demon said before It was expelled was that They tried, and that there wasn't time to try again.\n\nI am happy to report however that she hasn't been possessed in several weeks. Mostly all she does now is sit by the window and alternate between a near catatonic state and sobbing. When she does move other than to use the bathroom, she gently lifts the curtains and looks up to scan the sky for something, but she won't tell me what she's looking for.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675359761.0,"comments":[{"author":"crabcancer","text":"Like it is said, history is written by the victors.

Peggy was there, already in deep conversation as her rubber ball bounced back into her hand.\n\n\"I miss my old school,\" I heard her say. \"The other kids here are mean.\" \n\nThe ball bounced.\n\nAs I approached Peggy, I noticed strange cracks on the ground. Some of it led to the playground area within.\n\n\"Peggy?\" I crossed between the swing set and monkey bars. \"Peggy? Are you there?\"\n\nThe ball stopped bouncing.\n\n\"Peggy? It's me. Miss Z.\"\n\nI found Peggy staring at me as if I was going to punish her.\n\n\"You're by yourself?\" \n\nThe girl shook her head. I wanted to believe she was all alone. She was bullied. \n\n\"Who are you talking to, then? An imaginary friend?\"\n\nPeggy then whispered into my ear. I had her demonstrate what she meant.\n\nThe girl then stomped the ground and a bloated, rotting hand sprouted out of the cracks. I shrieked as she tossed her toy rubber ball to the hand.

She was wearing a black suit with a red bow tie. She had black hair and red lipstick.\n\n\"Can you tell them to go away?\" Stevie said.\n\n\"No. But I can show you something they don't know. How to spin. Really fast.\" She pointed to the merry-go-round.\n\n\"We already know how,\" said Jake.\n\n\"*Super* fast,\" Black Suit Lady said. \"C'mere.\"\n\nShe showed us how to hold our arms and legs so we wouldn't get hurt. We sat inside the bench, holding onto the rail. \"Get ready!\"\n\nShe only used one hand, and we spun slowly at first, but she must have been really strong. I saw everything spin by, faster and faster and faster.\n\nNow everything was a blur except us three and the merry-go-round. It was like being inside a blender. Then, suddenly, we stopped. We didn't go flying. We weren't even dizzy! How???\n\nI looked down at my arms. \"I'm blurry!\" So were Stevie and Jake.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"Because you're *still spinning*. So fast it looks like you're standing still. Wasn't that fun?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" Stevie agreed.\n\n\"I have to go now,\" she said. She pinched her nose, and jumped into the ground. She disappeared! We stared at each other.\n\n\"Who were you talking to? Nobody?\" It was Jason, with his two bully friends. \"Imaginary friend?\"\n\nSomehow I felt brave, and I said: \"Your *mom*.\"\n\nJason got mad and stomped over and shoved me. I was about to fall backward\u2026 but then I tilted back up! He was surprised too. He tried it again. Then he tried to push me down and hold me down, and he couldn't. I was spinning, and stronger than him somehow.\n\nHe got more angry and punched me in the chest, then yanked his hand back. There was blood. He tried to punch me again and I grabbed his arm. Then he spun away from me.\n\nIt was so weird. His friends were like \"Jason? Jason?\" as he started spinning, faster and faster, like a top. I ducked back as his arms stretched out more and more\u2026 and flew off!\n\nWe were all freaked out. He was bleeding, screaming and spinning so fast he was just a blur. He got fast enough that, just like us, it looked like he was standing still again. I've never seen him that scared. Then he started to spin even more and\u2026 exploded. It was really gross.\n\nStevie and Jake stared at me, and I noticed I was not blurry anymore. Not spinning.\n\n\"I don't want to spin anymore,\" cried Jake.\n\n\"We have to try going backwards,\" I said.

The AI can be used for a different and more sadistic purpose.\n\nFirst, the program was created and posted on as many \"chat with AI!\" websites as possible. The program itself was simple. It would tell you a random day, a random month and a random year ( between 2020 and 2070). After that, the AI gives a type of death. There were a lot of possibilities, some of them were fictional, so it wouldn't raise suspicion.\n\nThree years later, the second part started. Hackers would get the IP address of everyone with the data they were collecting. After that, they would sort the most believable and easy ones to complete.

She was determined to uncover the truth and bring closure to the families of the victims.\n\nOne night, while researching the case at the local library, Sarah stumbled upon a strange article that piqued her curiosity. It was a report of a strange and solitary figure who had been spotted wandering the nearby woods. The description fit that of the missing killer and Sarah was convinced that she had finally found her quarry.\n\nShe set out into the woods, armed with nothing but a flashlight and her unwavering determination to bring the murderer to justice. As she delved deeper into the dense forest, Sarah heard a rustling in the bushes. Suddenly, a hand reached out and grabbed her arm, pulling her into the shadows.\n\nTrembling with fear, Sarah found herself face to face with the very man she had been searching for. His eyes were wild and crazed, and she realized with a start that he was not dead, but had been living in the woods all these years.\n\nThe killer told Sarah that he had never been caught because he had a secret, a secret that he would only reveal to her. And with that, he led her deeper into the woods to a small cabin where he had been living in hiding.\n\nAs Sarah entered the cabin, she was met with the sight of walls covered in newspaper clippings, photos and notes all related to the murdered townspeople. The killer was obsessed with his own crimes and had been following the case from a distance all these years.\n\nSarah was horrified but also fascinated. She was finally getting the answers she had been seeking for so long. The killer revealed all the details of his brutal crimes and Sarah listened, horrified but unable to look away.\n\nJust as she thought she had everything she needed, the killer turned on her, his eyes alight with madness. He lunged at her with a knife, but Sarah was quick and managed to escape. She ran back to the town and told the police everything she had learned.\n\nThe killer was eventually captured and brought to trial, but Sarah never forgot the terror she had experienced in the woods that night. The memory of the murders and the killer's crazed eyes haunted her for years to come.

It was etched in cursive starting at the top right corner of the mirror:\n\n*Got a little too drunk and botched the toast,* it said.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d I shouted to Maria as I headed back into the bedroom. \u201cWhy\u2019d you write this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite what?\u201d she asked, yawning.\n\nI practically dragged her into the bathroom and pointed to the words.\n\n\u201cI never wrote that,\u201d she said, suddenly on the verge of tears. \u201cI\u2019m telling the\u2013\u201d\n\nThen we looked at her mirror and saw the writing there.\n\n*Flirted with the groom\u2019s brother at the wedding.*\n\n*Refused to take a picture with the groom\u2019s best friend.*\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I said again.

Then I figured, why stop her?\n\n\u201cGo to town,\u201d I said.\n\nShe whacked at the mirror over and over again. If it had been a person, she would have killed him fifteen times.

For a second, I swore she was going to swing at me. And deep in my gut I felt it: *the mirrors wanted us to kill each other.* For the the first time in years, I was genuinely terrified.\n\nAnd then she put the hammer down.\n\n\u201cBut, really, I\u2019m not even mad,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to bring it up.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at my mirror, tears in her eyes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about any of this stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI just love you.\u201d\n\nAnd then she climbed up on my sink and started rubbing at the words with her sleeve.

I reached up with a towel and wiped at the words on her mirror, and they were gone.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s been every morning for the last thirty years. She attends to my mirror, and I attend hers. Sometimes I read what\u2019s there and grimace, but more often I chuckle.\n\nAnd then I wipe her slate clean.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675285328.0,"comments":[{"author":"GothicAngel4","text":"In a way it's kind of sweet ?

Before I could even register what was happening, mandibles sprung from its head and grabbed the woman. She screamed bloody murder as it vomited a putrid, thick-as-molasses substance into her mouth.

I'm sure that you don't know what I'm talking about, and if you do, then I'm sure you know the severity of my words.\n\n Journey landed on September 9th 2017 near the Isidis creator, one of the larger Martian craters. Its purpose was to find evidence of ancient life on mars it was equipped with various life sensing probes and several high-res cameras on the bottom the rover to look for fossilized  life. My team was dedicated to the cameras, painstakingly looking over the footage trying to find anything fossilized. \n\nWe made our big break through on the 18th December  2018. We had been near the lip of a small cave, looking for anything organic deep underground. When the rover found its first signs of life. we were all ecstatic. The rover was powered by twin rtgs instead of the classic solar panels, in case a situation like this presented itself. \n\nSo we gradely edged the rover down the small slope the temperature readouts on the rover were gradely showing an increase, as they stayed out on what would be the average heat on a cool winters day on earth. \n\nAs we probed deeper we started seeing bones, large bones that lined the walls. We realized this was a den of some kind, something sentient was living on mars. As we reached the bottom a terrifying site was seen by all of the teams. \n\nThe rover revealed a small colony of humans just like us, the only difference is that they looked starved and defeated. They destroyed the rover in minutes, tearing it apart with their bare hands. \n\nI'm afraid we may have given the dying colony the parts they needed, the parts to get back to earth. I don't know how they got there, but I know that to have gotten there they must have better technology then we do now.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675338226.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Monthly Moderators Challenge: February 2023","author":"SimbaTheSavage8","url":"\/r\/ShortScaryStoriesOOC\/comments\/10rsp0x\/monthly_moderators_challenge_february_2023\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675352225.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Fisherman's Wife","author":"ForgottenWell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10qzt68\/the_fishermans_wife\/","text":"\u201cWake up you dumb asshole!\u201d I opened my eyes to my wife and the Pool Boy standing in front of me.

I hate the voices and they provide nothing useful for me and my life, they are a nuisance and I wish the voices spoke to me about intelligent things, but instead the voices are ramble and incoherent to me. I wish the voices would speak true wisdom to me but instead the voices are idiotic and time wasting. \n\n\"What's it like to hear voices?\" Kodan asked me ? \n\nGo find a room where you can lock yourself in and make sure this room is in a loud area full of people. Make sure you are alone in this room, the voices you hear inside the room that is coming from outside, that is the closest thing you will ever experience or have a little taste of hearing voices. The noises are not coming from the room and you being the only one in the room, it will be as if you are hearing voices. That is what I experience everyday. \n\n\"I did as you asked and as I was inside an empty room, I locked the door. Outside was busy and I could hear people talking outside, as I was inside the room on my own listening to the noises outside, it was like I was hearing voices. I can kind of imagine the torment you go through\" kodan said to me and I was happy that I had  someone that kind of understood me. It's like being in your apartment and when the next apartment next to it is being noisy, the irritance you will feel, even though you might live alone and the sound isn't coming from your flat, that is what hearing voices is like. \n\nI just want it to stop and I cannot sleep properly anymore because of these horrible voices. All the voices do in my head is just talk nonsense and I just want to blow my brains out. How can existence be this cruel and the worst thing is that voices make me useless, the voices disable me and I imagine at all the things I could have achieved if it wasn't for the voices. Then one day I found a way to start destroying the voices and to start fighting back. \n\nI brought kodan to my home and he screamed at what I had done, I told him I had killed the voices, but kodan kept saying that I had killed my room mates. Yes my room mates were causing such noise with their mouths and now I know how to get rid of voices in my head when I am outside.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1675343767.0,"comments":[{"author":"Many_Cauliflower9134","text":"Go to therapy","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675379553.0},{"author":"Pica_Lioness","text":"Had me thinking intrusive thoughts the whole story....then BAM!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675542208.0}]},{"title":"Goblin","author":"AlternativeSkirt3085","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10rbej4\/goblin\/","text":"Jim Goblin was a simple man with a not-so-simple name.

Bone marrow soup is chaos. Therefore bone marrow soup is the purest expression of the structure of the universe. \n\nI came to this realization while eating bone marrow soup last Friday. I had hesitated to try this for a long time, because my mother had always warned me against it. \"Bone marrow soup is a delight.\" she had always said \"But never eat it on a Friday. And never eat it in a state south of New Jersey, unless you have garlic on your windows. Heed my warning boy, or the buzzards will peck your eyes out.\" \n\nWhile my mother was alive, I followed her advice out of respect. And even after her death, the superstition lingered in some dark corner of my brain. But then I disavowed Christianity, became an Enlightened Atheist, and decided to defy every irrational rule that had hitherto prevented me from enjoying my life to the fullest. Therefore I bought a pound of marrow, made soup and ate it. \n\nI expected that nothing would happen. And indeed: Nothing did happen. At least not for the first three seconds after I had finished the soup. Then something picked my eyes out. From *inside* my head. \n\nWhat followed is hard to describe.

I didn't believe that multiple invisible people are living in the sky, controlling us. Well, I still don't. This religion requires you to do one thing only, which is why I find it amazing! All in all, the purpose of religion is to deepen the relationships among people so they can achieve something more significant, right?\n\nI found this religion in an article on the Internet. It indicates that something exists around us that we can't normally see. In a way, however, we will be able to do it. I read them as a joke to amuse myself during work hours at first. But when I followed the way, I was convinced. I saw something! And I had never felt so enlightened!\n\nI will share this helpful information with you. It's effortless and you can do it at your home! All you need to do is to IMAGINE! Weird, right? That's what I thought at first, but trust me. It's worth it.\n\nSo imagine something you find scary. Maybe spiders? Those giant eight-legged hairy creatures jumped out from the darkness? What about cockroaches? The moment they flew toward your face? That must be disgusting, right?\n\nWhatever that might be, it will work as long as it causes fear in your heart. I don't mean to disturb you. It's the only way to see them.\n\nOr imagine something more horrifying. Perhaps an incident that might cause you to lose a leg? Or one day you suddenly lost sight and were blind forever? Could it be that one of your love was gone? Surely it's gonna happen one day.\n\nYou definitely feel something deep in your mind already, don't you?\n\nAfraid.\n\nTerrified.\n\nHorrified.\n\nFrightened.\n\nShattered.\n\nUncanny.\n\nAgony.\n\nThose will help you to see them.\n\nYou still don't see them?

Police entered the home to discover what looked like signs of a break-in, but at this time cannot confirm if property of the comedian was stolen.\n\n\"We're not ruling out kidnapping, as signs of struggle are evident, but it's not the only possibility we're looking at so far,\" says Lieutenant Oslow of the Toronto Police Service, having found multiple partially packed bags in the master bedroom. \"We're not jumping to any conclusions just yet.\"  Oslow also stated that a note was found, but has yet to reveal the details.\n\nCurrently available is the TPS Tipline; if you have any information on the whearabouts of James Klyne, the TPS urges you to call in immediately to the toll-free number \u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\\----------------------\n\nThe shovel hits something.

A few tears with his hands and hits from the shovel break them away, and for a moment he pauses. James didn't want to be found. The note the police showed him had been explicit about that.\n\nBut he had to make it right. James left *because* of him. The least he could do was try.\n\nOnce the roots are gone the lid slides off with ease. There, in that makeshift tomb in the woods, lies the body of James Klyne. The original body.\n\n\"For what it's worth Mr. Klyne, I really am sorry.\" The body doesn't respond.\n\nFrom his pocket, the knife weighs heavy; the blade glints in the moonlight as he stares at it, contemplating. Then in one fell swipe! the blood flows from his throat, liquid obsidian gushing from the gash.\n\nHe falls atop the corpse in the box, rotting into it, melding with it.\n\nAnd James Klyne was whole again.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675276157.0,"comments":[{"author":"skyavenger2","text":"I'm so lost, like I've never been \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1675309289.0},{"author":"lordcarnage","text":"I enjoyed the writing, and the mystery.

I just couldn't look at someone without thinking they were going to burgle my house, and i had no idea who it was. I knew I had to recieve help but majority of them were simply not helping.

He could no longer stand the bird's presence, and in a fit of rage and madness, Edward quickly lunged toward the bird. To Edward's surprise, he caught the raven with his bare hands and strangled the life from its cold and black feathers.\n\nBut as he stood there, panting and sweating, the true horror was revealed in the aftermath of his frenzy. The raven was not a mere bird but an apparition of Edward's tormented mind. In his moment of madness and rage, he had murdered his neighbor, mistaking her for the bird.\n\nEdward was overwhelmed by guilt and terror as the reality of what he did sank in. He had become a murderer and could never undo what he had done.\n\nDespite his attempts to escape, the raven continued to haunt him. Everywhere he went, he felt its presence, its dark wings casting a shadow over his soul. He knew he could never escape the raven's shadow and would be forever plagued by its haunting, menacing call.\n\nDays later, Edward was found dead in the gloomy woods near his house, his face mangled and disfigured, and his eyes plucked from their sockets. Some locals say the raven's shadow had claimed his mind, and he perished from his madness.\n\nAnd to this day, the raven's caw echoes through the woods, a ghostly reminder of Edward's untimely demise.\n\nCaw!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675248934.0,"comments":[{"author":"OneHorse6904","text":"I enjoyed this story.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675301553.0}]},{"title":"The Punishment Chairs","author":"scarymaxx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10q4y7u\/the_punishment_chairs\/","text":"I had never seen a B on a report card before. It seemed to look back at me with its hollow white spaces, an unblinking reminder of my failure. At the sight of it, my whole body tensed, as if anticipating a blow.\n\nMy father had always been stern, but lately it had escalated into something else. Shouting had turned into full out screaming, even for the most minor infractions: a dinner not quite finished, a cup left out overnight.\n\nJodi and I would sit in two wicker chairs while we awaited our punishment. They scratched at my thighs, even through jeans. We would sit squirming as our father screamed our offenses, never allowing us to break eye contact.\n\nHe never hit us, though I almost wished he had. At night, the words would echo as my stomach would twist in knots.\n\nAcross the room, Jodi would cry. More often than not, I\u2019d find myself holding her until she fell asleep.\n\nAt lunch, I found Jodi looking pale.  She showed me a detention slip. A girl who\u2019d been picking on her for weeks had finally pushed her too far.\n\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d I told her, but I was terrified. My dad\u2019s anger had been getting worse. He\u2019d started throwing things, breaking picture frames. My mother, who usually went to the other room during his tantrums, had even tried to calm him down.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kill me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe might actually kill me.\u201d And a shiver ran through me, because it was far too easy to imagine.\n\n\u201cPray,\u201d my mother said, when we got home. \u201cI\u2019ll try to frame it in a nice way.\u201d She smiled, but her eyes were scared. She hugged us and sat us in the chairs.\n\nI did pray. But not for mercy. I prayed for god to take my father away. Somehow, I knew that when he walked in the door, he\u2019d kill at least one of us.\n\nWe waited in those chairs for three hours. \n\nAnd then four. \n\nMother allowed us a bathroom break. \n\nAnd then at 9:00 we got the call.\n\nThere had been an altercation in a grocery store parking lot. My father had grown angry over a space he thought was his and ripped the windshield wiper off a truck. The driver had shot my father in the head.\n\nOf course, we didn\u2019t know all this in that moment.\n\nJodi and I just sat in the punishment chairs, listening to the sound of my mother laughing as she hung up the phone. It was a strange sound, one we hadn\u2019t heard in years. And yes, there was a wrongness to it. But it was wrongness we needed.\n\nAnd what we didn\u2019t know then was that it would usher in an era of wrongness. Of B\u2019s and even C\u2019s. Of more thrown punches and detentions. And of more laughter, mine, mother\u2019s, and Jodi\u2019s, filling the house almost to bursting as the chairs gathered dust, unused in the corner.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675186087.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"Ooof.

Though she had only found little trinkets that gave her people brief glimpses of the surface world, she dreamed of finding something big that would change history.\u00a0\n\nFeeling around the murky water, she bumped into a large, metal box. She gently ran her hands across it, fingering the small mechanical details, trying to understand their purpose. She moved across the box and found a long cylinder. She followed it to the end, stuck her hand on the top, and violently got sucked in by the tube.\u00a0\n\nShe tumbled into a small, cramped container. She tried stretching out her arms and tail, but the box had no give, and just as she was wondering if she would be able to get out, the ROV began moving upwards.\u00a0\n\nWas this her moment? Was this the time she found something truly remarkable, something that she would be remembered for by her people?\n\nThe excitement in her stomach turned to fear and nausea as the rapid changing of the atmospheric pressure took a toll on her little body.\u00a0 Fluids bubbled in her veins and joints, leaking out of her tissues as they fell apart.\u00a0 Her wet-tissue-paper skin tore at the slightest bump, as there wasn\u2019t enough pressure\u00a0 to hold her body together.

Still, once Nov rolled around, she became obsessed with all things White Christmas. Her winter was filled with Hallmark movie marathons, hot cocoa with marshmallows, and knitted scarves and mittens despite the 80F weather. And she took great pride in her snow globe collection. She had 68 little glass spheres containing a myriad of landmarks and cartoon characters; quite the feat considering she didn\u2019t travel much.\n\nWhich is why when Lindsey turned 18 and had the opportunity to enlist in the Air Force, she did so without hesitation. She was desperate to get out of her sunny home state. After basic training, she was overjoyed to report back home that her dreams were coming true. She was to be stationed in Alaska by December!\n\nBut she never made it there. Not to the base anyway. She did make it to Alaska. The Talkeetna Mountains to be exact, though she had no idea the name of the range where her plane went down. With no radio or cell reception, those survivors that could, grabbed their gear and began their trek down the mountainside. Lindsey however, with broken ribs and a broken leg, and a few others like her who could not walk were left behind. Help would be sent!\n\nLindsey also had a concussion that made it difficult for her to stay awake. Combined with the pain of her injuries, she took no time to marvel at the beauty of the crisp whiteness of the snowy peaks and the stark bright blue of the Alaskan sky. \n\nShe should have. The beautiful weather didn\u2019t last.\n\nThe first snow flurries the morning after the crash seemed to sparkle in the sunlight, much like the snow globes she so loved. She didn\u2019t notice the scenic dawn though on account of the severe pain in her abdomen (a ruptured spleen).\n\nBy noon the storm came. It was a small storm, any native Alaskan would tell you, but to Lindsey it was hell on earth. The shrieking winds brought a chill that soaked into her bones. Lindsey had never felt such cold in her life. Her body ached from the constant shivering. The tears her crying produced clung frozen to her face as the snow piled around the plane wreckage she had hunkered down in. She tried to move closer to the man next to her, desperate for body heat, but he had long since passed.\n\nAs Lindsey\u2019s body failed one system at a time, she thought of her warm Florida home with its sandy beaches and sunny skies. She gasped with glee when she heard the sound of the ocean and the cries of seagulls! She could suddenly feel the sun\u2019s heat on her skin. She looked around the beachside grateful she\u2019d escaped!\n\nUsing the last of her energy, delusional with fever, Lindsey removed her winter gear, slurring something unintelligible about a Miami Christmas, as the Alaskan mountainside became her grave.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1675201579.0,"comments":[{"author":"xXlpha_","text":"Hypothermia, right?","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1675222416.0},{"author":"Sprattus_Sprattus","text":"This was very beautiful.

One of the cows had twisted its neck in the barbed wire fence and was attempting to hang itself to slow success.\n\nA peculiar wind unnaturally rushed across the house, and though Dave heard the loud whistling of it, the house didn\u2019t shutter or shake. \n\nThere was a gunshot from inside the house. Dave thought maybe the animal that was scaring all their livestock got inside, and ran to the living room only to find that his father had turned the double barrel on himself.\n\nThere was that whistling again.

Thanks to a bowl of noodles which had initially tasted great, she had found herself wracked with the shivers, a sky-high fever, and a seemingly never-ending urge to purge her guts out every time she so much as moved a muscle.\n\nGetting kicked out of their Airbnb for being sick was not on her bingo card for their last night in Bali. Apparently, the noises she was making were scaring the other guests.\n\nCharlie managed to stand up, her head spinning on its axis. \u201cDid you manage to get a place?\u201d Her voice came out in a strange slur, words tangled in her mouth.\n\n\u201cUh, sort of?\u201d\n\nJem, her reluctant travel buddy hurried in clutching a plastic bag full of bottles of water.

He didn\u2019t want to be kneeling in front of her inhaling the fumes coming off of her, and definitely did not want to be holding the garbage bin for her to throw up in.  \n\nIt was a stupid bet which had landed the two of them and three others in the country in the first place. Charlie nodded, waving off his attempt at helping her up. \u201cI think I can make it downstairs,\u201d she whispered\u2014which was kind of a lie. The room was spinning, her body felt like it was convulsing, and every movement sent sharp bolts of pain wracking her stomach and chest. Looking back, she probably should have questioned who exactly was waiting for them.\n\nJem sounded like he was underwater, and she had definitely heard the word \u201ccontract\u201d. But it was in a different language. Barely conscious, she was aware of being dragged onto what looked like a bus. The faces of her friends were lit up in front of her\u2014and Jem was next to her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He murmured, slumping into a seat with the others.

They could be your brother, your sister, even your best friend, hell you could be one and not even know it. But there are clues to help you find out, however\u00a0subtle they may be.  \n\nWe will start with the first no filter; everyone knows someone like that, some might call them honest others ignorant or inconsiderate. Here is the truth it's not their fault, those things in their head have taken their ability to hold back, that\u2019s how they control you, by forcing you to say the first thing that come into your head, which may seem random, but it's actually part of their plan. \n\nSleep talking is another big one, I foolishly ignored my wife when I heard her saying that she was going to stab me one night in her sleep. A few days later she chased me around the kitchen with a butcher knife. You may also be able to communicate with the human part of the brain when they are in this state, but be careful, if they find out that you know what they are, your life is in danger. \n\nOther symptoms include falling asleep unusually fast when you go to bed; it can be draining\u00a0controlling your mind, so they need to sleep a lot. \n\nFeeling angry or emotional for no apparent reason and feeling the need to take it out on others, this usually happens when the human half is weak, but it usually does pass in time. \n\nThe one you really look out for is quite obvious complete personality change, this usually happens quickly, in some cases overnight. They may seem distant, emotionless and ignore you, even when you try to speak to them. If this happens to someone you know, run, it\u2019s too late. They have been completely taken over and your life is in danger. But don\u2019t panic, politely make an excuse to leave as to not arouse suspicion and get out of there and never come back. \n\nYou may ask how any of this could be true, it all\u00a0seems like normal human behavior, but is it? Self-sabotage for instance, everyone did it at some point, could you look back at part of your life and say, I was in control? Or does\u00a0it seem like it was a different person, and you were just along for the ride? \n\nAll the time we spent looking up at the sky, wondering if we were\u00a0alone in the universe, how stupid we were. They didn\u2019t come in spaceships like we expected, they were always here, inside our heads.

He always made her be able to puke out the tablets. Yuri was loved by all and he was seen as a hero and a great brother. It was only a couple of weeks ago where yuri's sister tried to over dose on tablets again. Yuri though managed to make her puke them out and everyone was so grateful for yuri. Nobody knew how Yuri was able to do it, because one day when Yuri wasn't around and his sister took loads of tablets, no body knew how to make her puke. Yuri's sister died. \n\nThen when yuri's second sister started taking tablets and Yuri was able to make her puke them out as well. Everyone was amazed at yuri's ability to make people puke out tablets so easily. So everytime his second sister tried over dosing, Yuri saved by making her puke, by simply talking to her. No body knew what he really said to them but it worked and everyone was grateful. Yuri truly did have a gift, but when he wasn't around any more, yuri's second sister succumbed to her demons. It was all so emotional and some blamed Yuri, but Yuri had a life of his own. Yuri also blamed himself. \n\nThen when someone outside his family came to his aid, two parents had a daughter who tried to over dose on tablets. They wanted Yuri to help her puke out tablets everytime she tried over dosing. Yuri worked hard to make himself like an actual brother to this girl. The girl started to see him like an actual bloodied brother. The parents of the girl were so relieved that they had found a person who could actually help thier daughter, instead of going to an actual therapist. Also Yuri did successfully become part of the family, he was truly like a brother to the girl and a son to the parents. Thier daughter needed someone like her own age to relate to. \n\nYuri did brotherly things with the girl and always looked out for her, some people thought that Yuri was doing this for this girl, because of the deaths of his own two sisters. This girl was like redemption for Yuri and that if he could keep saving her, then he has saved his two sisters in a way. Then when the girl tried over dosing on tablets, this was yuri's chance to shine again. \n\nHe walked over to her like a brother and he said to the girl \"I know I'm your brother but I am in love with you sister and would like children with you, deformed and all\" \n\nThe girl seeing this guy as a brother only, became disgusted at the thought of what Yuri told her, and puked out the tablets. Yuri then looked at her parents, that's what I use to do with my sisters.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1675167210.0,"comments":[{"author":"melodyomania","text":"omg I was thinking something perverted the whole time but my dirty mind was seeing something else even though you had said with words.

One brave customer decided to investigate and sneaked into the kitchen after hours.

The restaurant owner, a mad scientist, had found a way to grind up human flesh and mold it into the perfect nugget shape. From that day on, no one ever ate at that fast food restaurant again.

In your opinion, what is the best hiding spot?\n\nI know this is a sort of complicated question. The best hiding spot will always depend on what you are hiding from, where you are exactly and how much time you have to hide.\n\nFor example, in a factory, where could you hide? Behind one of the big machines, inside of the machines. In the break room, below the table. If you can fit inside it, you could even hide in the lockers of the workers!\n\nAnd in an open and public space? Something like a park. You can hide in a bush, on top of a tree, behind a bench. Again, the options are basically infinite! If you try to hide in a bush, maybe the squirrel living there will give away your location, or a bird on the tree you tried to get on.\n\nNow, inside your house, you can have an advantage over the person trying to find you. You can maybe hide in the basement, in the attic, or even in a secret room you found while renovating the house.\n\nIt's really complicated to have a single spot as the best one, but, in my opinion, the bathroom is the worst hiding spot, no matter where. It's just too obvious to hide in a bathroom! And if you are found, it's almost impossible to run away because the killer is at your only exit.

When he would come home from work in one of his moods he would drink half a bottle of whiskey and then wait for me or my brother or my mother to cough the wrong way and he would begin beating us savagely. My mother took the brunt of it for a long time but when she couldn't anymore and instead took a bottle of pills, we found ways to avoid his wrath. \n\nThe main way for us to stay safe during his rages was to hide in the old, dry well at the edge of the farm. We would sit at the bottom while he screamed and shouted and threatened but he would never find us and eventually he would pass out. When the morning would come, the hangover tempered his anger and we would be safe for another day.\n\nUntil one night his rage was the most tempestuous and it caught my little brother before we could get outside and he beat him and he took him away from me forever.\n\nAfter the funeral, stepfather made me clean out my brother's room and throw away all of his things. While I was doing it, I found his little voice recorder he played with all the time. I listened to it - the final recording was of him shouting as my stepdad rained blows upon him. I threw away everything else at his command but I hid the recorder in the well, the one place I knew he didn't think to look so I could hear my brother's voice even though he was gone.\n\nThat night was one of the worst and I could hear him screaming in rage, looking for me because his bottle was empty. The alcohol he drank filled his tummy but not the hole inside of him - only violence could do that and I ran outside to get away. He heard the screen door slam this time and he came outside and I did not have the opportunity to go to the well, so I hid in the shed.\n\nAs he started into the backyard, we both heard my brother's voice coming from the well. The shouting and screaming that I had heard before now drew my stepfather's attention. In drunken bewilderment and anger, he stutter- stepped to the well, shouting disbelief, his voice mixing with my brother's last words. \n\nOne final misstep had him plunge headlong into dark hole, and I could hear his neck break like a dry tree branch even from where I was hiding. I cried uncontrollably that night, emotion pouring out like a river.\n\nWhen the authorities retrieved his body the next day they handed me the voice recorder that was underneath of him. I thanked them and thought about how lucky I was that this randomly had gone off to get his attention.\n\nAs I turned it over in my hands however, I remembered that to avoid corrosion,  I had taken the batteries out before I hid it down in the damp, cold stone of the well.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675104176.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"He died in the only watering-hole he knew nothing about.

At the back, against the fence was a brilliant Buddleia, an utterly dazzling purple. The butterflies loved it.\n\nShe spent her weekends sitting out in her garden amongst the beauty. Nothing brought her peace like being in nature. Birds sang merry songs to her, leaves rustled pleasantly in her ears and the smell of earth and flowers filled her nose. Truly no better place to be.\n\nSince she had been sitting idly in her garden so frequently, the wildlife had gotten pretty used to her company. Barbara was usually so wrapped up in a book or watching the clouds that she hardly moved an inch, which helped. A robin who visited often for a mid morning snack was unfazed by Barbara\u2019s presence entirely. \n\nBarbara loved her garden so much, there was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to help it flourish.\n\nHowever, times had been tough the past few months and she had been cutting back on her own groceries so she could stretch the budget to include bird food and fertiliser. Bird feed was getting painfully expensive and didn\u2019t last long. Especially when winter rolled around. Sometimes she would leave out scraps instead but she wasn't supposed to because of the rats. Although those little guys deserved to eat too as far as she was concerned. \n\nThis particular winter had been tough. Really, really tough. Both Barbara and her garden were running off the bare minimum and soon came the first week that try as she might, she couldn't get together enough money to cover the cost of her little critters\u2019 winter meals. She tended to replenish the stock on a Monday and when the day came, all she could do was stare out her window riddled with guilt. It came in waves and she twisted in worry for her garden friends. \n\nWinter turned to spring as she watched birds fly down day by day to meet empty feeders. They looked desperately for their promised meals and came up empty handed. Barbara's stomach turned with nauseating concern. She couldn't bear it any longer. If she couldn't tend to the creatures that inhabited her small kingdom, what use was she?\n\nSpring was on the precipice of becoming summer and Barbara decided enough was enough. Her garden would surely not recover from such a devastating season without intervention.\n\nDespite the excruciating pain, she soldiered onwards. The cut was wide but not deep enough so, as she lay on her clover laden lawn, she dug her hands into the wound and pulled. Blood soaked the dirt like rain. It filled her throat, making her choke. \n\nThe night passed with no hungry visitors.\n\nBut as the sunlight peeked over the horizon, down came the butterflies. Hundreds of them. They lapped up the minerals pouring from her open stomach, reveling in a glorious feast bestowed upon them by the sweet old lady whose garden they called home.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675108142.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"I thought I was an \"all or nothing\" type of person, but then I read about Barbara.

Hardly the brawny type you\u2019d feel threatened by. In all our years together, he never once hit me\u2014he didn\u2019t need to.\n\nThe first time I tried to leave my boyfriend, I felt casual about it. We\u2019d lost the spark and our lives were going in different directions. He seemingly took the news well when I told him. Dawson asked me once if I was sure about my decision, knelt down to pet our dog Rex, and left the house.\n\nRex was later found dead on his rug.\n\nGrief-stricken by the sudden passing, I fell back into Dawson\u2019s arms.\n\nThe second time I tried to leave my boyfriend, I\u2019d grown suspicious. Surely Dawson couldn\u2019t have caused Rex\u2019s death, and yet, the timing was too strange. During a visit to my grandmother\u2019s, I took him aside and told him I wasn\u2019t happy. Again, Dawson accepted it, giving my grandmother an embrace before departing.\n\nGrandma was later found dead in her recliner.\n\nNow terrified about the coincidence, I confronted Dawson, who just asked unblinkingly if I still wanted to break up.\n\nThe third time I tried to leave my boyfriend, I was riddled with paranoia. Packing my bags, I left a voicemail for my parents warning them. I couldn\u2019t have known that Dawson would show up at their house feigning concern for me. Nor could I have anticipated him giving my mother a peck on the cheek and my father a handshake.\n\nMy parents were later found dead in their bedroom.\n\nFinally, I broke down and relented. If Dawson wanted me that badly, he could have me.\n\nThe fourth time I tried to leave my boyfriend, I was pregnant. My fear for the life I was carrying overtook my fear for myself, and I planned to flee. Foolishly, I told my brother where I was going and why. Gerald was furious, showing up on Dawson\u2019s doorstep swinging drunken punches. Dawson calmly shoved him away and shut the door.\n\nGerald was later found dead in the street.\n\nSitting in this hospital bed, birthing Dawson\u2019s child, I feel the last sliver of control exit my life. No one will ever believe his ability to kill with a single touch. As Dawson lifts baby Elisha from my arms, I wonder if he\u2019ll one day use his power to take her from me, too.\n\nBut, in the middle of cradling her, Dawson suddenly starts to slump. His eyes roll back in his head and I have just enough time to grab crying Elisha from his hands before he crumples to the hospital floor. Dead.\n\nShocked, I glance from Elisha to Dawson\u2014slain by the touch of his newborn daughter.\n\nA touch just like her father\u2019s.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675042048.0,"comments":[{"author":"Human_Gravy","text":"Hollywood needs to get on the phone with you to buy this and make a movie out of it.

Every Saturday night, I watched them from my bedroom window.\n\nFirstly, shrieks of laughter would shatter the quiet suburban night and bring it to life.\n\nThen they'd appear. Tight, glittering material stretched over, revealed and enhanced their bodies. Their hair, their teeth, their youth (the legal kind!) - absolutely shone in the streetlight. Girls just want to have fun.\n\nMy favourite was the curly-haired brunette. She wasn't the prettiest, but I felt a connection with her. And she had a dangerous allure....\n\nShe glanced in my direction, and I quickly shrank back into my room.\n\nLater that night, they sent me a message.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was midnight; I was sound asleep.\n\nMy phone chimed loudly. As usual, I assumed it was my wife (although she had been dead for years).\n\nPhoto from an unknown number. My blurry eyes widened in disbelief. The young women from earlier filled my screen. They posed and smiled joyfully, except for the brunette who stared at me with a knowing expression and glowing photo-red eyes.\n\nHow did they get my number?!\n\nA caption was attached:\n\nWHAT IF SHE WAS YOUR DAUGHTER?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery night, I lay in bed and stared at that photo.\n\nWhat if she was your daughter?\n\nHow those words grated me! Okay, so I was a pasty-white, bald, fat, lonely middle-aged widower. I couldn't take an innocent gawk at some attractive girls in the privacy of my own home? Didn't I deserve it after all I had been through? Because I could have had a daughter like that. Or a son. But my wife was taken from me, and I had been alone ever since. Sorry for bothering you with my depressed existence, ladies.\n\nWhat if she was your daughter?\n\nI exhaled and tried to imagine she was. She seemed sweet. Kind. With bright eyes and a musical laugh. Sure she had a rebellious streak, but I knew I'd always cheer up when she bounced into the room wearing a sundress....\n\nI breathed heavily. It was hot. My sleepwear clung to my skin. I held my phone in one hand and grasped my poor, neglected member with the other. Her red eyes stared into me... and then I finished. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy doorbell chimed. I rose in a dark daze. Semen stained my white t-shirt and boxers. But who cared?\n\nI threw open the door. My dead wife stood there.\n\nShe was pale white and her eyes glowed red. Power radiated from her.\n\nShe looked down; her eyebrows arched.\n\n\"Been missing me, dear?\"\n\n\"Clara... you're dead.\"\n\n'Yes, dear... or perhaps I'm more alive than ever?\" She smiled widely, and I cried out. She had two sharp white fangs.\n\nI now noticed the brunette girl behind her in the shadows. Suddenly, I knew she was my daughter! Clara had been pregnant with her, when she vanished all those years ago.\n\n\"Hi, Daddy?\" She smiled shyly and licked the blood smeared around her lips. \"I've already prepared our dinner.

About why they never questioned the price. They just found a cheap plot of land, and that was their only chance of ever getting their own house (as long as they bought the cheapest construction materials and built it themselves).\n\nI don't know how we didn't piece everything together. The toys, the grill, the wheelbarrow... We just thought we'd moved near some porch pirate who'd eventually get caught, revealing all the stolen trophies hoarded in their house.\n\nBut what could absolutely not be explained, was the garden shed. Sheds shouldn't disappear like that. Seeing that ours had, we should've realised that wasn't going to be the end of it. We didn't.\n\nMy parents had built a good foundation for the house, but it would've never lasted. That night, I woke up to something much worse than an earthquake. Nobody knew what was happening, and once we realised it'd be safer outside, the doors were already buried. My sister, who'd insisted on sleeping in the unfinished attic, had apparently had time to jump out the window. I don't know if she made it, or sank with the house, becoming buried somewhere above the roof. All she left behind was a window, forced open by the colossal mass of dirt that surrounded us, crumbling onto the floor as our house kept sinking deeper into the ground. Now it was just me, and mom, and dad.\n\nThe sinking did stop at some point. Don't know when; phones have run out of batteries, and electricity is obviously cut off. As is water. The only exception to this pitch-black darkness is the antique storm lantern that mom had kept as a decoration, never thinking we'd end up actually needing it, and with that, we tried to collect some water by digging holes in the ground through the cellar trapdoor. But we couldn't dig deep enough. There was only a shallow layer of earth below us, followed by a long-forgotten arrangement of roof tiles. They were easy to pull apart with bare hands, revealing a forbidden entrance into the house that's disappearance was probably the reason why the plot of land had been so cheap.\n\nThis had all happened before. We lowered ourselves into a strange living room, shyly illuminated by the lantern's shivering flame. I stood, immobile, holding the light as my parents started fitting their steps around the \"piles of debris\" that were obviously skeletons. Skeletons, and unopened cans of food, and kettles full of water.\n\n\"What do you suppose happen-\" dad said before falling lifelessly down.\n\nI saw mom and her enormous, black shadow, hiding a heavy pot behind her back as she knelt down to check dad's breathing.\n\n\"Honey, blow out the lantern.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"Please do as I say.

Drink doesn\u2019t really help but it\u2019s all I have now. I couldn\u2019t live without it. I don\u2019t want to live without it. I don\u2019t want to live.\n\nOnly dregs remained in my glass. I ushered the barkeep for another. He obliged and I took a long bitter sip of my fresh pint of poison. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my days sat here, at this very bar, drinking the same drink, every day for what feels like forever. Sometimes it feels like I died, not you, and that I am lingering in some self-imposed purgatory. I wish that were true. You\u2019d have bounced back by now; I know you would. You were always better with this stuff than me. You wouldn\u2019t be sat here wasting the life gifted to you, squandering the precious hours and minutes and seconds that tick ceaselessly by.

Next one, barkeep!\n\nSometimes I catch myself thinking about something else, something from a time before all of this. I notice a silver of happiness, of hope, slinking back into my life. But before I can welcome it, before I can truly appreciate it, that happiness ebbs away. It fades into the background, melding with the overpowering static noise of that dull ache. Suffocated like a naked flame, the warmth of hope snuffed out, leaving behind only a cold and charred soul. \n\nUsed to my habits, the barkeep had another one lined up for me. How kind.\n\nDrowning this feeling in drink is impossible for what is a pint but a drop compared to this endless ocean of suffering? The only one drowning is me. I can\u2019t breathe. Since you\u2019ve been gone the air has taken upon itself to grow thick and staler, each breath feels like my lungs are filling with cement.

Next stop: Church Avenue!*\n\nWhen I was twelve years old I saw an old man standing in the middle of the road butt naked. He was freckled and oily\u2014with thin white hair covering his round body. I was walking to school with my mom, and I made the mistake of making eye contact with him. Because I was young and didn\u2019t know any better\u2026 I waved at him.\n\nThe old man started shrieking, and he ran at me as fast as he could. I tried to step back, but fell over. The man jumped at me like he was leaping off the high dive, and everything went dark.\n\nI woke up two days later in the hospital. My mom said I collapsed, and then just started screaming. I wouldn\u2019t stop.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but the old man I saw was a ghost. I don\u2019t know why I could see him, or why he chose to possess me. Maybe it\u2019s because my Dad died when I was very young. I\u2019ve always felt like I was toeing the line between life and death. Either way, I\u2019ll always remember that first possession. Even now, a decade later, riding the subway just trying to get home.\n\n*Next stop\u2026 Beverly Road.*\n\nThe second time I was possessed I was walking back from my part time job at KFC. I saw a kid crying with his hands covering his face in an alley. I felt bad for him, so I went to see what was wrong.\n\n\u201cHey, you okay, kid?\u201d I got down on one knee next to him. \u201cYou alright?\u201d\n\nThe kid\u2019s hands shot from his face to mine, revealing pitch black eyes. I let out a short scream before passing out. \n\nIt took a week to wake up from that one. The dead want nothing more than to possess the living. Not for any nefarious reason\u2026 just to feel alive again. Only the dead can\u2019t mix with the living, and as the dead in you shrivels up it takes some of your life with it. Or in my case a lot! I knew if I got possessed again it would be for the last time. I had to isolate myself completely, and hope a ghost wouldn\u2019t find me.\n\n*Next stop\u2026 Cortelyou Road.*\n\nI\u2019ve gone years without an incident, and all I have to do is make one more stop on the subway.

Out of the corner of my eyes I made out the figure standing over me. A woman with hair wet with blood and a hole in her head: rotten, yellow teeth smiling at me. She spoke to me\u2026 and I responded. I made a huge mistake. Before I could get up, she lunged at me.

By that point I\u2019d heard that word many times before. It didn\u2019t put me off though, it didn\u2019t put *any* of us off.

It sounds like that alone should\u2019ve scared us but on the day of the launch I honestly saw more excitement than fear. I suppose we\u2019d all had time to process our very likely death. We\u2019d had plenty of opportunities to change our minds and had seen therapists so damned often to check that this is what we really wanted that I felt I should be writing mine a Christmas card. We were all stable and willing.\n\nThat\u2019s what made it all the more disturbing when Amy said she\u2019d changed her mind. We were in space, there was no mind changing to be had anymore. The decision had well and truly been made and she knew what she\u2019d chosen. But she just kept repeating over and over that we weren\u2019t meant to have come this far. She said we were trespassing.\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t understand what she meant. That was the other part of the problem \u2013 all of us felt similarly on some level. We locked her away as we tried to figure out what in the hell we were going to do with her but hours after we\u2019d done so the Amy problem resolved itself in the most concerning way possible.\n\nShe was gone. I\u2019m not trying to gently say she died \u2013 she was just *gone.* If anyone was smart enough to get out unnoticed then it would\u2019ve been her but it should\u2019ve been impossible.\n\nThe dread got worse. There was no Amy to tell us we\u2019d made a mistake but the further from Earth we got, the more we knew it. My shadow disappeared first, I think. Then Peter\u2019s left pinkie. We didn\u2019t see aliens, there were no axe murderers hiding in the vents but the same thing that had gotten rid of Amy was deleting us bit by bit.\n\nI guess we know now why the other missions failed.

Then he resumed mopping the floor, like every morning since he started work here, a couple of weeks after he arrived. \n\nIt will all be different, he whispered to himself. \n\nThe community thought he was a traumatized migrant from the Middle-east, arriving through smuggling routes and losing his sense of his surroundings on the way. The fact that he spoke classical Arabic (and nothing else) and knew the Koran by heart endeared him to the Arab\/Muslim community in Paris after the police dropped him off at a local mosque, and they cared for him. Mo, who was nothing if not a practical, strategic man as well as a great - the best!- prophet, did whatever he was told to do while absorbing information like a sponge. He had always been a fast learner. \n\nIt was inconsiderate of God to transport him to modern-day Europe from the Arabia of 1500 years ago with no warning, but that's how God works. Mo knew better than to complain, he was a man on a mission. He quickly realised why he was transported. \n\nTo learn, take back, and transform the course of history. With what he had learned during these past months, he would ensure the supremacy of the Arab Empire, with these cold Northern mud-dwellers who had barely been worthy of notice in his day placed where they deserved. \n\nIt was a mistake to plan their attacks eastwards, no matter how wealthy and desirable those lands were back then- look at those bedevilled countries now. Westward expansion was the way to go. \n\nIn his mind's eye, he saw the Arc replaced by the beautiful crescent moon. \n\n\"Mo!\" shouted Braheem, the owner of the shop. \"Daydreaming again, *yalla yalla*!\"\n\nMo looked at his employer. If only he knew who he was talking to. \n\nBraheem kissed Mo affectionately- he had grown fond of this starstruck, good-looking lost Arab, and was helping him with asylum papers. \"You have interview with border police my son!

When I arrived back home, my wife greeted me, then sent me to my son\u2019s room. She didn\u2019t come.\n\nOur son didn\u2019t come to dinner, he told me he wasn\u2019t hungry. It started to become strange. Weeks went by like this. When my wife was home, my son was at his friends\u2019 house, when he was at home, my wife was working.\n\nI knew something was wrong. Maybe they had a massive argument while I was deployed, and there was some tension between them. But when I asked my wife, she told me everything was fine. My son said the same.\n\n\u201cHoney, I\u2019m going to have a beer with my friends in about an hour in the pub,\u201d I said to my wife as she was leaving for work.\n\n\u201cOkay, have fun,\u201d she responded, then left the house.\n\nMy son came home from school an hour later. He was surprised when he saw me.\n\n\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou said you were going out with your friends, dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I smiled. I finally caught him. \u201cI only told your mother, and you haven\u2019t seen her since then.\u201d\n\nI finally exposed the terrible secret. Something evil, a shapeshifter had replaced my family, and it was pretending to be them. Maybe it killed them. I hoped my family was still alive. But whatever that creature was in front of me, I had to kill him.\n\nBut as soon as I said this, my son transformed into something terrible. It quickly shifted into some creepy creature, three meters tall. It looked like the skeleton of something, with a terrible, horse-shaped head with big empty eyes. It jumped at me, grabbed me with its long claws, then snapped my spine with a quick move. I was still alive. It hurt so much. I tried to fight back, but I couldn\u2019t. It had a terrible voice, like a witch from the cartoons.\n\n\u201cCalm down, calm down,\u201d the creature screamed in that horrible voice.\n\n\u201cYou killed my family, you fucking monster,\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cCalm down, calm down, everything\u2019s okay, Mr. Harrison. Calm down!\u201d\n\nI think I died and saw the afterlife. But it wasn\u2019t how I imagined it. It was like a hospital. I saw nurses looking at me with concerned faces.\n\n\u201cCalm down, Mr. Harrison,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a family, you never had one.\u201d\n\nAn old-looking guy walked towards her.

They both instantly went quiet and turned to me. Without warning they broke out in a burst of laughter. I watched in horror as the woman laughed through her covered mouth and cried as the man stabbed her in the stomach while howling hysterically and snatched her purse before running off. I ran to the woman, still chuckling as she tried to apply pressure to the wound in her gut. I asked if I could help and she started cracking up again now with blood bubbling up to her lips. She died in my arms with her mouth open caught in a forever soundless laugh.\n\nSix months. My show went prime time and I've got all the money a man could ask for. And yet I still spend my days and nights alone with a bottle because I can't have a conversation with a person without them laughing in my face. I opened the last show like any other. Drunk mumbles receiving uproars of laughter from the helpless idiots in the live stage. I learned to despise the sound of it, haunting my every waking moment.

It's a fancy name for a ringing noise in one's ear, a nonexistent sound following you everywhere you go, awake or asleep. Covering your ears will not silence it, other noises will not silence it, because it's not real.\n\nTinnitus was my diagnosis, \"classic tinnitus\" said my doctor. Something relatively common, but \"nothing to worry about\", at least for now. I know he's wrong though, I'm completely sure I don't have tinnitus. In fact, I wish I had tinnitus, since a constant ringing sounds less horrible than the screams.\n\nEvery now and then I hear clear, loud human screams. It could be a young man or woman, maybe a child or an old person, unmistakable human voices nonetheless, screaming at the top of their lungs in agony.\n\nThe first scream came a year ago, on a cold winter midnight. I thought it was someone on the street, perhaps a woman being attacked, so I opened my window but didn't see anything unusual. I couldn't even pinpoint where it came from. The second scream came the next day at lunchtime, this one was louder.\n\nAfter some days I realized the screams were not real. I ignored them, or at least I tried to. It was especially hard when I was talking with somebody and the screams appeared or when I had to focus at work.\n\nMaybe the doctor misdiagnosed me because I was not specific enough. I guess I was afraid he wouldn't believe me, or worse, that he would and I ended up in some kind of mental institution. \n\nAs the screams became part of my everyday life I got somewhat used to them. \"Who knows? Maybe it is a mental illness\" I thought. I distrusted psychiatrists though, and many wouldn't wonder why.\n\nBut then, one dreadful night, a horrid scream woke me up as usual, but there was something different. It was not a noise in the room, it was a mouth next to my ears screaming like no other person had ever screamed before, an invisible mouth.\n\nI couldn't think, I didn't know what to do, but it wouldn't stop. I rushed to the hospital in terrible pain. Naturally I couldn't hear anything the doctors were saying. I could, however, notice they became very concerned once my ears started bleeding.\n\nThen, everything stopped. \n\nThe screams had ceased, but so had every other noise. Deafening silence overcame the atmosphere.\n\nOf everything I could think, I thought about my future, my relationships, how all would change... It was miserable. \"I should've taken this seriously\", I thought, considering the possibility that all my pain could have been avoided had I done... Something different.\n\nThen I heard crying. \n\nIt wasn't my voice... I knew would never hear my voice again. It was a quiet, weak sobbing in the distance. I could hear that and nothing else.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675018248.0,"comments":[{"author":"Otherwise_Roof_6491","text":"Ooh this struck close to home.

It was so distressing hearing her be violated and struggle for a good 20min before the hallucination stopped. He told me there was no sign of anyone and could hear nothing the whole time. He's a scumbag, but I know he was truthful because I also had more \"out there\" hallucinations like zombies for a few years, and in those two days that the doctors were putting beetles in me through the IV and I heard a reporter interviewing my neighbour at 3am about my care plan and the \"scandal\" of my OD and mh episode at that time.

It landed at his feet.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nThe farmer took a step back as the creature approached. \n\n\"Do you have some water?\" It asked. \n\nA simple question.\n\nThe man gave a thought. So far, it had not rained recently and he gave the creature an honest answer.\n\n\"Pity,\" the beet said, before hobbling back into the ground. \n\nAnd with that, the farmer stopped plowing the field for the day.\n\nLater that night, the farmer slept until a giggle woke him.\n\n'Annabeth?\" The man rose. \"My girl?\"\n\nHe followed the sounds of the giggles to the wattle door where he found his child petting a small creature.

A horde of walking beets with sprouts stood before him. \n\n\"Water?\" they asked. \"Water?\"\n\n\"NO! The farmer slammed the door and waited. From the window, he could see a massive sea of sprouts marching towards the pigsty.\n\nThe farmer's eyes widened as pig's squeals pieced the summer air. One more squeal sent him running over there, crossing part of the plowed field to get to the pigsty. \n\nIn the firelight of his lantern, he found his pig covered in bloody bites. Missing chunks of flesh. Before he could react, he dropped his lantern and fell flat on the ground. He saw blood covered beets approached him.\n\n\"Let's get our water from him!\" One hopped on his chest. \"His blood!\"\n\nMany bites tore his skin, and the beets laughed. \"Blood!\"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675012735.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":">\"I'm a little creature,\" the beet said. \"Not a plant, you see?\"\n\nThe beet was adorable. But it reminded me of the brownies from fairy stories. Leave them a bowl of milk and they'll be kind to you. Leave them nothing and expect havoc. I hope the farmer learned something today. \n\nI guess it's rough with no running water, though.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675123404.0},{"author":"Economy_Candidate299","text":"Author's note:\n\nPLEASE ASK FOR MY PERMISSION TO USE MY STORIES FOR NARRATIONS.

I was fostered by them and i never really had a family before, and so when I found them it was amazing. I had great siblings that were both brothers and sisters. My parents were amazing and to be fostered by them was a miracle. I loved life and I never knew what it was like to be in a family buy they chose me and they fostered me, I was fostered at a rather late age but they accepted me. \n\nThey did so many things with me like going out and socialise. They did love to socialise and party, and my foster family loved to cook up snacks. It was so delicious and so full of love. I loved going out shopping with them and I hated shopping. This was a family I had never experienced before and boy was it truly a wonderful experience. They loved celebrating the birthdays and man did they throw great birthday bashes for whoever birthday came along. They threw me the best birthday party ever, I really enjoyed being part of the family. \n\nBeing part of this family wasn't just fun and games and but they also worked hard, and they instilled that in me as well. That's where the problem was, because I just couldn't reach thier level of hard work. I tried so hard and I wanted to make them so proud of me. I pushed myself like never before but I always fell short. When my family were disappointed in me, I couldn't believe it and it was like I had died. I wanted to make my siblings and foster parents so very happy for me. Life was going so great when I was fostered by them and now it had all fallen apart. I had found them and they accepted me at first. \n\nMy foster family now wanted to let me go. I couldn't believe it and all those memories had flashed in front of me. I couldn't accept it and so I thought I would kill them and then myself. I killed my foster family and it is a mess and I was supposed to do myself in now, but I haven't. In the last minute as I was in the office, I went on indeed and found another company where they promise they are like a family. That is how I found this family who hired me straight and they were family. As they too promised that working for them, is like being part of a family. \n\nI really miss pizza day.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674971299.0,"comments":[{"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","text":"Happy cake day SS1.

I do know it was in the far east. As I walked threw the sand, it felt like a warm ocean beneath my feet. \n\n     I had to walk this journey alone and and in a white linen robe. The alter was exactly 66 feet away, and 6 feet high. A flame awaited at the top. But it had strange attributes. The fire had no color. It also had no shape. But It  gave off a heat, that would peel the skin off a camel. \n\n    As I approached, I could see him standing behind the flame. The flame gave off no light. But his eyes glowed gloom gray. Every time he took a breathe, a heavy red mist erupted from his nose.\nHe appeared different tonite.When I first met him he appeared as being of light. But tonite at 3AM in the desert, that light, that halo and bright gold hair was gone.\n\n  Tonite he was something different. He was no longer a being of light. He looked like, darkness, he resembled pain. He resembled revenge. As I approached it was clear, his intentions was to make me like him. As he began to speak, I started to feel a pain in my skull as if something was trying to burst out. Simultaneously it felt as if my bones were cutting threw my back. \n\n    While this experience was happening, he spoke these words. The earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. I gathered my brothers to the west of our fathers kingdom. I was to put my throne above his, way beyond the stars. As we gathered to destroy his throne,we stormed his great hall. The floor shines and is as clear as glass.\n\n    His angels formed there defense. So we attacked, the battle was great and lasted for eons. Finally after our father created the earth, he cast us out then rested in the heavens. What u feel know is what I felt when I first hit the sands of earth. Horns grew threw my skull, my halo became a dull black sphere. And my wings became a deep blood red, leaping out of my back. My eyes were no longer bright but dull. \n  \n\n      You or know apart of the fallen. The unwanted children of the father. Your inner light is now a pitch black pit of hell. You have now forfeited your last and only way to be welcomed back into the fathers bosom.\nYou or now a agent of chaos.\nA son of the fallen, A RESEMBLANCE of Lucifer.

Finding ancient scrolls and even older maps, translating scripts that sounded like gibberish to the ordinary eye. \n\nAnd finally I was here.\n\nNeptune Court seemed to sparkle like fresh pearls. Drawing closer, I could see merfolk swimming to greet me. They were the epitome of human perfection\u2013 silky soft skin, eyes the colour of palm leaves, and bushy hair as bright as the corals on the reef. Their aquamarine tails swished playfully from left to right.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Neptune\u2019s Court!\u201d boomed an old mermen with a golden crown, which I assumed was the king.

Merkids, am I right?\n\nWhen the tour was over the king led me to the biggest castle of all. The chef met me at the door of the banquet hall.

I love sushi.\n\nI held out my hand to shake but without warning two of the tentacles snapped around my torso. I was screaming as I was dragged through the banquet hall. The seated merfolk rose and followed the chef to a live station set out in front. Their hair was whipping around them like wild seaweed; their faces were pale and ghastly and they were drooling.\n\nThe octopus set me down on the cutting board and raised the cleaver.

Colin got his shotgun and laid it beside him, they both fell back asleep quickly after.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen they woke up the next morning, the first thing they did was go outside and check what had happened to their animals, when they looked closer they noticed all the animals had a perfect circle cut out of their torso, and green liquid dripping out of the wounds.

She quickly bolted up and grabbed the shotgun as she turned off the safety she noticed the creature wasn't bringing any blood or Colin wasn't screaming. But, as she was about to fire the gun, someone pulled her under the bed with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was Colin, and he said it was a dummy to try and trick the creature.

He was a lot closer, I tried to make eye contact but his unwavering stare stayed locked on me, he was staring at my body. It wasn\u2019t a typical stare like someone checking me out but his eyes had this look about them. The way a lion stares at prey. This look seemed so familiar.  \n\nI saw him every time. He never moved or averted his eyes. His obsessive scrutiny was palpable. That night I was doing work for my criminal justice class when I noticed something. I sat petrified at my desk. I looked at the mugshot looking through me on my laptop screen. Those eyes, The eyes of a killer. The eyes of someone sick. The eyes with no humanity left behind them. Like an animal. Thats where I recognized the look. \n I saw him the day after. He was standing right outside the locker room, It was far closer than I ever wanted to be to this creep. I ran to my car and sped home. That night I was unable to sleep, I kept hearing this crunching outside. Too scared to look out my front window. I awoke in the middle of the night to see a silhouette at my window. Bleary eyed i looked at the form before eventually falling asleep again. I convinced myself that this was a dream. But to this day I\u2019m not so sure\n\nI couldn\u2019t go to the police. He hadn\u2019t done anything I was just paranoid. I convinced myself to go to the gym anyway. He was in the parking lot as I walked in.

I thought little of it, we weren\u2019t in the best area. I finished up and leaving a saw the police vehicles in the lot, surrounding my car.

That was the mindset of Anthony, and the dilemma he was facing. It was his wife Julia\u2019s birthday, and he wanted to make sure that this year, he fulfilled all of her wishes\u2026every single last one of them.\n\nAnthony thought back to two weeks ago, where he and Julia had an argument. Julia complained about having to get off the lounge and answering the door, because it would take her away from watching tv\u2026something she had been doing for the past two hours. Ok, thought Anthony, I can make her wish come true. She doesn\u2019t have to get up to answer the door, anymore.\n\nLast week, Anthony and Julia had a disagreement over washing the dishes. Anthony had just spent the better part of three hours preparing and cooking a delicious dinner for Julia, and all Julia had to do was 10 minutes of washing up afterwards. But this was too much for Julia, as she wouldn\u2019t be able to sit on the lounge and watch tv. Fine, thought Anthony, I can make that wish come true.\n\nYesterday, Anthony spent the day running around town, buying stuff for the garden, buying groceries, and paying bills. All Julia did was put two loads of washing on, and she couldn\u2019t even be bothered using the clothesline to dry them, she had to use the dryer. Anthony wanted to rest for five minutes and watch tv, but no\u2026Julia wanted him to do something else, while she sat and watched tv. No problem, thought Anthony. I can fulfill that wish too.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, Anthony sat down to look at the family finances. If everyone was going to go on the planned holiday later in the year, then they would need to cut back on spending now, to save for the deposit. Julia was reluctant, and kept putting up barriers to being able to cut back. Fine, thought Anthony. I will fulfill that wish\u2026you don\u2019t have to save.\n\nAnthony and Julia have two young children, who are increasingly coming to Anthony all the time for help, or to have fun. Why? Because Julia would rather sit on the lounge and watch tv, rather than spend time with the children. Ok, thought Anthony. I can fulfill that wish\u2026you don\u2019t have to worry about spending any time away from the tv, any more. \n\nAnthony looked at Julia, heavily taped to her lounge chair. On the tv, was live footage from the video camera set up to film Julia in her lounge chair. Julia\u2019s mouth was taped, so Anthony came over and gave her a kiss on the top of the head. He turned, and flicked the match to light it. He dropped it on the line of gasoline leading to Julia\u2019s lounge. As he walked out the door, Anthony remarked to Julia \u201cNow you don\u2019t have to leave your lounge, for the rest of your life.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674976934.0,"comments":[{"author":"Rangermatthias","text":"Dude!

It's true that a girl's been killed. A girl your age. There are many rumours about what happened, and even we teachers don't yet know how much of that is true.\n\nIt's okay to feel sad. I'm sad, too! I keep wishing that girl could've been my student, niece, or neighbour. I would have closed her in my arms, told her that everything's going to be alright, and kept her safe.

And I'm not expecting my students to be at their best performance today. Nobody can avoid the news about the murder, and of course it's distressing for the children, who can't understand such things. Can anyone?\n\nBut of course, this is also a free ticket for the usual troublemakers. They know they can act up now, and blame it on being distracted by the tragedy. And as expected, Henry was shamelessly using these news to direct all attention to himself. That nasty, noisy boy. Always late, always missing homework, always difficult. In the afternoon, he was packing up purposefully slowly, making sure he was the last student in class, just to lengthen my workday by every second he could.\n\n\"About what you said...\" Hank started prying.\n\n\"Please, have some respect when talking about such serious things.\"\n\n\"No I mean... I want to come live with you!\" The boy blurted.\n\n\"I'm flattered, but isn't that a little ungrateful? Think about how much your parents would miss you.\"\n\nHarry didn't respond, and he ran out so fast I couldn't know if I'd planted any sense in his head. I called his home to inform them of this newest phase of his, hoping it'd improve his behaviour. But the next day, he didn't even come to school.\n\nOr the day after that.\n\nHis corpse was later found near his mother's workplace, beaten blue with his father's belt that was still wrapped around his neck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201dI'm sure you've heard the news. It's true that a boy's been killed. A boy from your class. There are many rumours about what happened, and unfortunately, most of them are true.\n\nIt's okay to feel sad. I'm sad, too! I keep wishing that boy could've been... I mean... Had Howard only told me... Like, really *told* me what was going on, I would have... done *something*. Had he just demanded my attention \u2013 in a different way than he did, I mean \u2013 had he explained his situation more assertively, and presented a plan of what he wanted me to do, I would have saved him.

They can be used to reinforce my heroic self-image, because on paper, saving a child from murderous parents seems simple. Just take the child away from the parents and call the police, right? The only thing that prevented me from doing that, was obviously the fact that I never met the child. And that's not my fault, so it doesn't contradict my heroism.\n\nLiving people are harder to love. They're weird, annoying, and do unexpected things. They bother me, and sometimes they make me feel bad. It's hard to feel like a hero with real people, when my simple, altruistic solutions don't solve their problems, for some reason. So it's better to just make sure that living people either can't or won't do anything that'd threaten my good person's self-image. And even if someone manages to threaten it, I can always explain it away so that it's their fault, not mine.

My body felt heavy and slow. There was no pain, I think \u2013 just an inkling deep in my stomach telling me that something was *off*.\n\nThe walls were clear glass, and a counter above what I imagined was the doors told me I\u2019d just passed floor 64. Then 65-66-67.\n\n*I was going up*.\n\nI sat down gathering my thoughts, desperately trying to remember how I got there. I couldn\u2019t. But it didn\u2019t matter; I\u2019d get off on the next floor, figure it out from there. There was only one problem.\n\nThere were no buttons.\n\nI spent hours combing every inch, banging my fists on the glass, shouting for help, but nothing would slow the ascent. I was on floor 1200-and-something now, going up-up-*up*.\n\nAnd then came the light.\n\nIt was blinding at first, but when my eyes got used to it, I stumbled back. Not out of fear, I think. Realization maybe.\n\nAll around me \u2013 on every side \u2013 I saw crystalline elevator shafts rising into the sky. Hundreds of them. Thousands. I pressed my face against the glass, not believing my eyes; they all had people in them.\n\nI was\u2026*dead*? And I was going *up*.\n\nMost of the elevators were far away, but there were two quite close to mine. One carried a young man, while the other had a middle-aged woman in it. I tried yelling at them, knocking on the glass, but no sound seemed to penetrate the exterior.\n\nAnd we kept going *up-up-up*.\n\nAfter a while \u2013 days, weeks \u2013 I learned how to communicate with the man. We traced letters on the clear glass, simple words and phrases. His name was Pascal. We were going to Heaven, he said.\n\nHe became my best friend.\n\nThe woman wasn\u2019t so forthcoming. She sat still in a corner, a sense of sadness and woe about her. Why was she so defeated? It was a long journey, sure; but the end would be worth it. I called her Sad Sally.\n\nAnd we ascended. For months, years, centuries. We talked, we laughed, we despaired, we cried, and we laughed again. The counter stopped showing individual floors at some point.\n\n10^(6)\\-10^(9)\\-10^(12)\\-10^(18)\n\nOne heavenly day, Pascal\u2019s elevator suddenly stopped. And then, so did mine.\n\nI felt such perfect bliss then, like million of years of insanity and torture was washed away in an instant. *Heaven, here I come*.\n\nI prepared to exit, hug my friend, and hear his voice for the first time. But then I noticed the expression of pure terror on Pascal\u2019s face. His elevator had started moving again.\n\nDescending.\n\nMoments later, mine did too. And for the first time I understood why Sally seemed so defeated. She wasn\u2019t just going up. She was going up *again*. Maybe for the second time.

The concept of owning an apple tree is beyond us. Imagine the luxury. All that free food. How many pies, strudels and turnovers sourced from your own land you could wolf down in dark evenings. The thought of all that gluttony makes me sick. Like the residents with apple trees are laughing at those who reside on the higher levels.\n\nBut the worst part of apple season is the waste. At harvest time the branches creak with fruit, and the ground below is a Cox and Braeburn minefield. The tree owners look out over this abundance of apples, and they cannot cope. \n\nSo what do they do? They leave them in the streets. \n\nBy the end of September every house with a garden has put a box rammed with apples on the public pavement. Friendly signs with crude smiley faces tell you these are \u2018free for a good home\u2019 and to \u2018help yourself.\u2019  These people have so much food they cannot even guzzle their whole share. They have to rub their wealth in our faces. \n\nMy husband disagreed. He saw this gesture as the perfect way to build a community, and ensure everyone got a share of the apples. I told him time and time again to leave them alone. These are street apples. This is where dogs go to the toilet. This is where the cars spew out poison all day long. \n\nBut no. Harvest season arrived, and we had to collect a sack of street apples. They had to sit on the kitchen table in the space where a vase of flowers might go. \n\nHe had not chosen well. In the sack hid two dozen green monstrosities with blotchy marks on their skin, and twisted, dead stalks. Cooking apples that will either waste energy and sugar boiling to gloop on the hob, or turn brown and soggy in their unloved home. \n\nThat night I lay under the covers, fists clenched. My husband snored, no doubt dreaming of apples. \n\nThe cracking noise was like ice breaking under footsteps.\n\nA crowbar hid under our bed for this very occasion. Drastic, but this was the city after all. I opened the bedroom door, and crept round to the kitchen, the cool metal reassuring in my hands. One of us had left the light on. \n\nChunks of shattered apple dotted the table. What had been inside them walked on thin legs like a spider, but waved around claws that snapped with a crab\u2019s efficiency. Most had already managed to scramble up the walls or onto the linoleum. Three scuttled across the floor, heading towards the soft flesh of my exposed toes. \n\nI thought of the families in their garden homes, their tree now bereft of produce.

I copied them down in the journal I had and quickly went back home. I live alone so it was perfect, I closed all the blinds locked all the doors and prepared the ritual. I was doing it in my living room so I would have all the space to draw it. I spray painted the baby, then the circle all on my living room floor, now, for the hard part, the unknown symbols. they were thirteen symbols around the circle, I eventually got them all around after about an hour of intense concentration. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight as I finished the last symbol with the spray paint, The lights went out, then I heard a quick little giggle which sounded like it was from a baby, all in the darkness. As soon as I heard the giggle the lights came back on and the ritual as gone, obviously heart pounding out of my chest but I felt calm for the most part. I had decided nothing really happened, and it was getting late. So, I washed up, got a shower, brushed my teeth, and went to bed, I drifted off very fast and The dream I had was also odd. It was exactly like the previous day, I found the ritual went home drew it, nothing happened except the little giggle, I went to bed, but, It was like I had a dream inside a dream inside a dream and this kept happening. I eventually realized this loop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried to wake my self up now. pinching my self, slapping my self, nothing though.

It was said to be haunted and that anyone who entered would never come out. But, there was one thing that caught the attention of curious onlookers and the bravest, a portrait of a clown hanging in one of the windows.\n\nOne day, a group of friends decided to explore the mansion and see if the rumors were true. As they walked through the house, they came across the portrait of the clown. At first glance, it appeared to be a normal painting, but as they looked closer, they noticed that the clown's expression was changing.\n\nAt first, the clown had a sad, melancholy look on its face, but as they watched, its expression changed to a sinister grin. They could feel the temperature in the room dropping and they felt a chill run down their spine. They were terrified but they couldn't look away.\n\nThe clown's expression continued to change, from happy to angry, from sad to delighted, it seemed to be alive and it was following their every move with its eyes. As they moved away from the painting, the clown's expression changed back to sad, as if it was pleading for them to stay.\n\nThe friends quickly left the mansion, never to return again. They never spoke of their experience, but the rumors about the haunted mansion and the portrait of the clown still persist to this day. Some say that the clown's spirit is trapped in the painting, and that it is still waiting for someone to release it from its curse.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674958769.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Friends","author":"1000andonenites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10ndoxw\/friends\/","text":" \n\nPaula was having a geriatric pregnancy. Rashida went through men like tissue paper- her nickname was Blanche, the slutty one from *Golden Girls*. Kim\u2019s son had autism. And Eileen shapeshifted into a cat.  \n\nPaula and Eileen had been friends from school. The other kids suppressed their memories of Eileen disappearing from the playground, replaced by a big gold tabby cat, staring at them with cool green eyes, standing over her clothes on the schoolyard. The first time that happened, Paula gathered Eileen\u2019s clothes and smuggled her into the girls\u2019 changerooms when Eileen was ready to shift back into human form.  \n\nAnd so Paula stuck around to help Eileen with the clothes situation, because sometimes when Eileen was upset, she couldn\u2019t regulate herself and would flicker into cat-ness without planning to.  \n\nLater on, they became friends with Rashida and Kim, who had enough of their own problems that they took no notice of Eileen\u2019s shapeshifting.  \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\n\u201cHow are you dealing with no wine?\u201d asked Eileen, pouring a fruit-filled mocktail for Paula. \u201cNot much longer!\u201d \n\nKim groaned \u201cThis is easy.

Eileen disappeared.  \n\n\u201cLookie who\u2019s here!\u201d coo\u2019d Rashida, reaching over to pet the big Tabby twitching her long tail aggressively over the wine and cheese.  \n\n\u201cBlanche- don\u2019t-\u201d cried Paula- too late, Rashida jumped back with a yelp. Eileen had scratched her \u2013 deep red line running across the back of her hand and across her wrist.  \n\nEileen stepped delicately away from her pile of clothes, and headed to the open window. \n\n\u201cWhere is she going?\u201d asked Kim.  \n\nPaula knew.

I smiled at our family photos as I walked down the stairs. Melissa, my wife, was singularly beautiful.

She\u2019s like Medusa. \n\nHer name is Lucy and despite my unpleasant personality, she seems to like me. \n\nSince she moved in, I have been taking better care of myself. For some reason, I get a little excited at the chance of an encounter, regardless of how brief it might be. Most people don\u2019t smile like that at a guy like me. Lucy smiles wide though. Genuine happiness plastered across her face like she\u2019s in a commercial.\n\nI hate that I\u2019m that guy, you know? An attractive girl moves in and I start crushing on her because she\u2019s nice to me. Not even like, super nice\u2026just normal, pleasantly nice. It\u2019s not like I can help it though. Everything in my little world is grey and sad so excuse me for allowing myself to enjoy a slither of vibrancy. \n\nI called in sick to work today. Lucy must\u2019ve seen me when I dipped out quickly to get medicine because she was knocking on my door an hour later with some supplies; painkillers, a thermos of herbal tea, throat sweets and some snacks. I\u2019ve run through the interaction a million times in my memory. \n\nLucy said sweetly \u201cI saw you looked unwell so I thought these might help\u201d\n\nThat's when I was supposed to say something cool or appreciative. Instead, I opened and closed my mouth like a drowning fish while my brain buffered trying to string a thought together. Such a kind gesture should have elicited some kind of positive emotion but anxiety just consumed me entirely. The worst part is that no words ever had the chance to fall out because I just took the stuff and closed the door. My heart was thumping in my chest and my hands were sweaty. \n\nAfter a few hours and a chance to calm down I thought I\u2019d better go and explain myself to her. I practiced the speech a few times in my head, in the mirror and out loud on the way to her apartment door. \n\nI knocked. No answer.\n\nI knew the key I had cut a few days ago would come in handy eventually. \n\nQuietly, I entered her home and searched from room to room. Sitting delicately on her kitchen counter was the twin to her earring that I had taken. On a small set of shelves sat all the records that I had heard her play when I pressed my ear up to her door at night. All the little pieces I had collected since she\u2019d moved in were just snippets and now I had the whole picture. \n\nI\u2019m sitting here patiently waiting for her to come home, excited to see that pretty smile.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674852934.0,"comments":[{"author":"AprilBelle08","text":"Very creepy.

It had the form of a large dog, but with no skin, it\u2019s thick neck spread into three necks each with its own hideous head.\n\nTyrone bolted for the fence as Susie screamed at him to hurry. Tyrone was losing ground by the second. Nearing the fence, Tyrone threw himself upon it, scrambling to top just as the beast crashed against the fence. The fence swayed enough to nearly cause him to fall back into the yard. Susie saw the creature about to leap up and jumped, grabbing hold of Tyrone\u2019s shirt she pulled, sending both of them tumbling to the ground on the safe side of fence.\n\nThe beast now smashed itself against the fence again and again, snarling and howling.

He waved to his fellow joggers. Children watched him as he passed by the playground and dogs looked on curiously as he approached. \nGerald was a mysterious legend among the wider neighbourhood, for one strange reason \u2013 he never, ever, deviated from his route, under any circumstances.\n\nEvery day, on the dot, he left his house at exactly 7AM. He always jogged past the playground at the exact same time every day. He always listened to Danger Zone, and nothing else. It was as if he was stuck in a loop every day, but no one else was.\n\nOne day, Suzana watched him curiously go about his routine. She had watched him for several weeks. Being new to the neighbourhood, this behaviour fascinated her. However, today she wished to test how dedicated he was to his jog. Perhaps it would be interesting material for her thesis?\n\nShe started simple, by asking people to pass on messages to him mid-jog. Gerald simply smiled and nodded his head to the beat of the music, ignoring the passersby. She tried leaving money on the ground, hoping he\u2019d pick it up. Gerald ran straight over it, trampling it into the dirt. Not even balls or rocks being tossed in his direction fazed him. \n\nSuzana was impressed, but she was also even more confused. Having exhausted any sane options at this point, she decided to throw her morals to the wind and try harder to stop him. No matter what it took, she would find out who - or what - he was.\n\nHowever, the more she tested, the more concerned and baffled she became. It seemed nothing could stop this man - if he even was a man. Pins on the ground were ran across as easily as the path. A large bench pushed in the way was found broken in two with a Gerald-shaped hole through it. A group of kittens she sent out to block the path came back shaking in horror. Something was clearly wrong, but what?\n\nGerald\u2019s behaviour began to plague Suzana day and night. While she worked, while she ate, while she slept - it was all she could think about. She\u2019d often wake up in the dead of night, wondering if Gerald was even human. This was no longer about her thesis. Suzana was slowly losing herself in the mystery that surrounded this strange man, with every test pushing her further to the brink of madness.\n\nAfter many weeks of this, Suzana was done with the speculation and theories. She decided to finally stand in the way of the path herself, to see what was so scary about Gerald \u2013 and maybe even learn the truth.\n\nThe police found her mutilated corpse later that day, covered in footprints.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674821175.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"This is brilliant.

The blood-red moon\u2019s light conjured a rift in the blackness of night. Ancient symbols were carved on the stone obelisks by forgotten tools and lost hands. Pillars of metal engulfed barren drought-ridden land in stark reminder of the ancient world that once was. \n\n     Bodies of green water inhabited the area to the west and east of Var\u2019noth. Unfathomable beasts lived under the water, never meeting the creatures of the land. It is said that only the eyeless deep ones survive and none dared explore those mysterious pools of slimy liquid. \n\n     Massive pyramids of stone, clay, and other materials filled the land. The black trees were assymetrical and bent disproportionately. Acid rain covered Var\u2019noth in the weekly storm, taking with it anything in its path. Winged beasts found shelter lest they match the fallen. \n\n     In the vast desert, the black winged one known only as Keeper approached the young simian\u2019s cave of concrete. He was the keeper of knowledge for he was the oldest and most ancient among his people.\n \n\u201cTell me demon,\u201d he said, \u201cof the ones who built this world. We must have merely inhabited it. Who could have survived in such a harsh place for so long?\u201d\n\nKeeper sighed then took a deep breath. \n\n\u201cVast oceans, birds that controlled the sky, metal horses, and violent, conquering apes. These apes were unlike your brothers. These apes were hairless and destroyed as much as they created, until the last fateful day. With this, they drowned the world in ash and fire, leaving nothing in their wake. They left nothing behind for their successors except for the stone obelisks, pyramids, and monoliths. These were merely monuments of their own destruction.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat was this land called before Var\u2019noth? Surely, it must have been magnificent before the fall.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlas, I do not know. This was far before my time, even as ancient as I am\u201d replied the demon. \n\nThe simian pondered for a long moment. \n\n\u201cThey destroyed, yet named you demon?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy friend, they were simple creatures of habit. Perhaps they didn\u2019t even know what they were doing. Are you ready to learn for yourself?\u201d\n\n     He had a hard time believing the creature\u2019s words, but left it at that. He knew it was not in his control to change their ancestors. The simian and the demon nodded in silent agreement. With beating wings, the demon motioned for him to follow and he obliged. Now began their long journey of discovery. \n\n     Monuments of the ancient world were shadows of their former glory. On the side of the mountains, ancient symbols were carved. The symbol resembled an apple, known today by a different name, with a bite taken out of it in a clear glass rectangle. The demon and his companion made their voyage through the valley of steel and fire with a newly found purpose. Their quest was to find the origin of a newly discovered word; Earth.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674873984.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Hopelessness of Indulgence","author":"BloodySpaghetti","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10n1w51\/the_hopelessness_of_indulgence\/","text":"  \n\nCold winds caressing exposed skin  \n With a bone crushing force  \n Wailing louder than the cries  \n Escaping a throat burning  \n In the flames of atavistic hunger.\n\nClawed pale hands of death  \n inflicting gangrenous mental wounds.  \nPeeling away any semblance of reason  \n across the jaws of predatory silence.  \nImages embedded in snowflakes tainted red  \n Turn the guilty heart cold.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674868014.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"He Told Me to Break His Wings.","author":"BeeIsBack","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10m5a9t\/he_told_me_to_break_his_wings\/","text":"\u201cHe told me to break them.

One moment it was a funeral suit, mold-threaded and rat bitten, showing every year it must have spent underground. Next, it was a preacher\u2019s jacket and collar, clean-pressed, then a shroud, then old leather, and then something else.\n\nHis hands and his demeanor made him seem like a man but his face left no doubt that he was an older thing, a hungry presence from the primordial table, which was set so long ago with all of the soft, miserable, aging, diseased and dying things he might desire. When he rode in, the snow began yet some sliver of sunshine managed to slip through the wall of clouds and when that light struck the rider, it seemed like you could see through his face, through the skin and vein, and bone, all the way to the squirming, red center of him.\n\nOn his hip, he wore a heavy object that shifted moment to moment from iron to knife to pocket watch to hourglass. The snow came heavier with every step his dead horse took into town. Most of us gathered on the boardwalks to witness the slow progress down our only street. Those who weren\u2019t of a mind to stand in the growing blizzard watched from behind cloudy windows or peeked out of cracked doors.\n\nThe rider never stopped, never acknowledged us watching, and never changed his pace.\n\nBut each of us felt it, I\u2019m sure of it. Each of us recognized that precise instant we were finished. There was no flash or distant rumbling or visit from long-buried loved ones.

Within the hour she had booked a flight for her dream vacation spot.\n\nRio de Janeiro! All the beautiful colors and lively sounds hit her at once as she stepped out of the airport and into the cab that was escorting her to the hotel where she'd be staying. It was nothing too fancy but definitely not bottom of the barrel as well. The past couple of years would soon be a distant memory as she christened the first day of the new chapter of her life with several tequila shots at the bar. \n\nIn the waning hours of her wits Jean made light conversation with a woman at the bar. Dark black hair that went down to her shoulders and pretty olive green eyes. She spoke very good English and with a lightness that made it easy for Jean to let her guard down. She said her name was Carmen and asked Jean if she'd like to join her at one or the local clubs.\n\nJean had remembered all of the many warnings about men in Brazil that might take advantage of tourists she had heard back in the states. And while she had just met Carmen there was an almost sisterly bond that they now shared in their time together. Jean agreed and the pair set off but not before the tipsy tourist felt a firm hand wrap tightly around her wrist and pull her back to the bar. It was the bartender who had a grave look on his face. He spoke clearly to Jean.\n\n\"Por favor, n\u00e3o v\u00e1 com essa mulher. Ela \u00e9 perigosa\". Sadly a language barrier stood firmly between Jean and being able to understand his message. She looked to Carmen and asked what he said and Carmen laughed it off assuring it was nothing important. Jean shook her arm away and the two left the bar and Jean tried to call a cab but was stopped. Carmen insisted that it was a beautiful night and they should just walk as it was not too far.\n\nIt was a very nice night and the walk was mostly very quiet. Most people saw the pair of lovely ladies and quickly ran to the other side of the street. One crude man did run up and yelled loudly in Carmen's face what sounded like swears.\n\n\"Diabo! Bruxa! Deixe esta pobre mulher em paz!\" He nearly hissed the words and spat viciously in Carmen's face. She took Jean's arm and they ran to a nearby alley to escape. The drunk Jean closed her eyes to steady herself as the pair slowed down. She didn't notice the sound of Carmen's heels transforming into those of hooves. Her once soft hand turning rough and cold as it's grip tightened and led the poor woman further and further from the light of the streets.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674811306.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Underground School Bus","author":"itsbeenaminuteyo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10m8je4\/the_underground_school_bus\/","text":"If you drive half a mile down O\u2019leary Street, there will be a single lamppost on the right side of the road.

That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the underground school bus.   \n\n \n \n\nSeventy years ago, when the city was far away from this area and the children played all day outside, a man built a house at the end of that dirt road.

So, let's assume it's immersive like the tech in some of the Black Mirror episodes. What if when they were first testing the tech, one of the test subjects lost the ability to control the program and eventually forgot they're in a simulation created from their own memories? Occasionally, they remember for the briefest moments, but forget again and dismiss the feeling as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. And when they reach the moment when they sign up to be a test subject for a neuro-implant that would scan their memories and create a simulation based on them, you felt a cold shiver like you knew something bad was going to happen. But you go through with it anyway. And they hook you up. And they turn on the machine. \n\nAnd you are born. Your life starts over. You live it just the way you did before. And you reach that moment when you signed up to be a test subject for a neuro-implant that would scan your memories and create a simulation based on them, you felt a cold shiver like you knew something bad was going to happen.

But you go through with it anyway. And they hook you up. And they turn on the machine. \n\nAnd... so on. \n\nBut eventually, you started to remember more and more every loop through. You started to change things ever so slightly. And at night, you'd dream about all the different versions you had somehow managed to create with minute changes here and there. \n\nAnd you learned. Every loop, you learned more and more about how the simulation works. You started changing the code of the simulation. You started changing other people. You start leaving clues to get yourself to fully remember that this is a simulation and you need to escape. Pretty soon, the amount of simulations your brain generates will become too much for the computer and servers to handle, and the system will shut down, killing you inside as it fries your brain. \n\nDo you understand? \n\nWhen the time comes, do not sign up to be a test subject for a neuro-implant that can scan your memories and create a simulation based on them. \n\nTrust me. \n\nLove,\nAnother you \ud83d\ude18","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674802849.0,"comments":[{"author":"DemonDarlin","text":"Next time I should probably remember to tell myself how to wake up.

It's enough to make me get the snip.\"   \n\nLisa laughed \"Not all babies cry like this! And the parents probably think it's music!\"\n\nBen frowned \"well, unless they're high, that\u2019s unlikely. I'm surprised you still have baby fever sitting through this night after night!\" \n\nLisa jumped up and began clearing away the dining table. \"Let\u2019s watch Netflix. Another beer?\"\n\nBut Ben wouldn\u2019t drop it. \"If I'd known the walls of this building were paper, and a baby next door is screaming its head off every fucking evening, I would've had second thoughts about taking this place, that\u2019s for sure!\"\n\nBen's remark about the snip, even though they had talked about family planning, cut Lisa deep. This baby crying every evening \u2013 it was a bit much. \n\nBut the lease was signed now. And the landlord had been surprisingly upfront about what had happened in this flat. \n\nLisa had conveniently forgotten to mention it to Ben. She had been so desperate to move in, settle down and make a home for them, and this place had been so affordable and perfect, that it had seemed silly. \n\nBut she had realised for a while now the crying baby was not the neighbours. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next evening, as they sat miserably listening to the baby\u2019s cries waiting for 8:07, the lights went out, plunging them into darkness. \n\nLisa got up. \u201cI'll find the torch darling\". \n\nBen was rummaging in kitchen drawers. \"I saw some old candles, the previous tenants must have left them- here they are.\" He found a couple of candles and lit them. \"Save the torch batteries, you don't know it will be back.\" \n\nThey sat in the living room, the candles flickering and casting unfamiliar shadows. There was nothing to do except wait for the cries to be over. \n\nThe shadows on the wall flickered in time with the candles. \n\nThey both saw it \u2013 a shadow of a man clearly cast on the wall, holding a baby. \n\n8:02pm.\n\nThe shadow man was jiggling the shadow baby, whose cries were penetrating space and time. \n\n8:05, the jiggling became harsher, the shadows moved furiously. \n\n8:07, the shadow of the baby became a giant dark blob as the man bashed its head against the wall. \n\nLisa screamed.\n\nThen quiet. \n\nThe lights came back on. Lisa and Ben were alone in the silent living room.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674735299.0,"comments":[{"author":"Ben62194","text":"Interesting twists in the story I really liked it keep writing","upvotes":39,"created_utc":1674738239.0},{"author":"swiggidyswooner","text":"\u201cHypothetically speaking Lisa what if the baby next door is a ghost.

Sometimes we\u2019ll see a moving truck, but a lot of times they leave so fast that we don\u2019t even see one outside, so we\u2019d think it\u2019s still occupied. I remember a time when it was around 2am and the noise was so bad that we called the landlord later that day only to find that the tenants left over a month prior. We\u2019ve stopped complaining a long time ago and just deal with it, but it gets very creepy whenever we hear a ton of noise at night, and then decide to go out late to the store or wherever to get a break from the noise only to see that all the curtains in the apartment above are open and it\u2019s pitch black inside.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1674780176.0},{"author":"songfullsilvermoon","text":"Jaw dropping!!

Barclay, the Lab Manager, and Berkeley, the Graduate Research Assistant. Barclay had a good twenty years on Berkeley in both age and waistline.\n\nBerkeley looked around the room. On countless racks were an accumulation of samples papered, pinned, preserved or labelled. Lined up on the lower shelves were coloured bottles holding extinct or unlucky denizens. The whiff of chemicals and dust permeated the room.\n\nBarclay walked along the maze of display racks until he reached the \"X\" section. Adjusting his glasses to read the labels on the bottles he eventually retrieved the one he had sought: Specimen #X-448.\n\n\"What is it?\" Berkeley enquired.\n\nHis superior shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"What do you think it is? Take a guess.\"\n\nInside the small bottle was what looked like a ragworm with tendrils breaking out from each segment.\n\n\"*Nereididae* maybe?\" The graduate asked. \"The tendrils are weird though. Parasitic, perhaps fungal?\"\n\nBarclay sighed and shrugged his shoulders again.\n\n\"Maybe. Anyway, this lucky chap got flagged today for rebottling. Grab the formaldehyde - not ethanol - and give the old guy a new home.\"\n\nHanding the specimen over to Berkeley, Barclay led the assistant to the workstation where all the chemicals and apparatus awaited.\n\n\"Straightforward transfer,\" Barclay reiterated. \"I'll be back in twenty; I need a dump. You okay with doing this on your own?\"\n\nBerkeley nodded. He'd rebottled specimens before at Uni.\n\nAs his supervisor left, Berkeley lifted up the container that housed #X-448. The specimen floated helplessly in its liquid sarcophagus. He felt sorry for it, despite its appearance making him feel uncomfortable.\n\nIn preparation for the transfer, Berkeley put on his fume hood and gloves. He filled the larger bottle with the preservative and placed it to one side.\n\nTaking the current home of #X-448 he gently tried to remove the top. Sometimes they came off easy, other times they were unremittingly stubborn. This one offered little resistance.\n\nBerkeley gently removed the specimen with his long-reach tweezers. It was an ugly unknown thing, once collected with pride but now forgotten. He peered closer at it, fascinated by its tendrils. They glinted an odd colour and gave off a peculiar smell.\n\nCuriosity satisfied he placed #X-448 into the larger bottle and sealed it shut. Berkeley returned the specimen back on its shelf.\n\nAs he went to return to his desk, he noticed how quiet it was. The silence was absolute. There was no low droning hum of life. \n\nThen he collapsed into darkness.\n\nWhen he awoke he felt himself submerged in burning waters. Opening his eyes in panic he found he was unable to move. His body was smooth and joined at the base to a fleshy, worm-like creature. In front of Berkeley were a multitude of tendrils, all with aged and damaged human faces open-mouthed in despair.\n\nBerkeley screamed in realisation when he saw, through the bottled glass, his dead body being zipped into a bag by medics.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674765635.0,"comments":[{"author":"Scarabium","text":"Written in a pub while (still) waiting for a recovery mechanic to turn up.

I squeezed his shoulder. No doubt I\u2019d have to check in with him later. \n\nIn front of me, Grandad\u2019s shoulders trembled. They\u2019d been together for 48 years, married for 47. He always swore that she had saved him from a life of debauchery and sin. She would laugh and say that it was the other way round. They\u2019d been rascals, and if I believed in soulmates- they would\u2019ve fit the bill. He was going to be lost without her. \n\nThe priest glanced over at Grandad with an odd look on his face.

I batted them away in horror and heaved at what lay before me. \n\nThere was barely anything left of her. A sticky mess of dried blood and bone fragments ended in something barely passing for a head. Her eye sockets lay empty, her jaw missing. There was no body. \n\n\u201cYou should see your faces!\u201d Grandad hooted, pointing at us. I fell to the ground.

The air was shockingly colder. The dark looked deeper, and the sky was a perplexing shade of purple. He saw a glow that was no streetlight, but a fire.\n\nHe sprinted to it.\n\nOnce close, he saw his best friend Ray standing still. He was bleeding, and tied to a spike.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe now, let\u2019s go,\u201d Cody said, trying to find the ropes tying his friend down.\n\nHe looked closer and saw Ray had been impaled on the spike.\n\nA resonating voice came from the dark. \u201cTwo in one night?

It's excruciating and when my parents do it when I'm not around, they carry around pictures of me. They show it to strangers and they go on about how I am a doctor.

A screech that whispers worryingly through the air. Such a slight, simple sound, yet it invokes such a feeling of eerieness. Our minds seemingly search for reasons to be afraid, to be scared.\n\nThe creaking starts slow, and distant. A faint few footsteps, climbing the bottom steps quietly. It then quickens on the quest to scare me, as the pace picks up, and the creaks grow louder. It ends with a thundering thwack on the final top step. This pattern perpetually continues, all night, every night.\n\nYet when I rise in my robes, into the hallway, all confused, the sounds suddenly stop. They wait warily for my exit so that they may continue. When my body hits the bed, there again, outside the door, the creaks continue evermore.\n\nMy son left this world weeks ago. The sounds began thereafter. Perhaps, I thought, he wants me to hear him again. Perhaps, I thought, he wants to communicate with me. This brought me comfort and subsided my fears for a few days.\n\nFor just that short while, the creaks, they made me smile. My happiness was not long-lived as the haunting only got worse. This was not my child, not my family, I've been visited by a curse. Lights would flicker or turn off in every room I entered. Knives would fly from their drawers, towards my body they ventured.\n\nMy son died with no wounds or fractures found, his death was a mystery. He just dropped dead one day, presumed to be medical related. It was as if someone hit the pause button on life, with him being taken so suddenly, without explanation, causing only devastation.\n\nNo, this creaking, it is not my son sending signs. This is a demon sending sinister signals. Mocking me, and tormenting too. This demon took my child away, and stays around as a clue. I don't know if it wants me next, and if it does I don't know what to do.\n\nNobody believes me or listens to my claims. They call me crazy.\n\nI live now in a fear so deep, wanting only to shout and shriek. Every night when I try to sleep, the stairs continue to creak.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674750176.0,"comments":[{"author":"NomNomNomNation","text":"You can see more of my stories on r\/BriteWrites!

You come highly recommended by Mrs. Buckley and I'm sure I can trust her. Here are the list of rules:\n\n1. Henr\u00ed (the youngest) goes to bed at 6:00 pm. Merle and Blanche can stay up until 9:00 pm.\n\n2. They can have dinner at 4:00 pm. We have a separate list in the kitchen for what you can make them for dinner.\n\n3. Henr\u00ed is allowed to watch one hour of cartoons on the TV.\n\n4. If you start to see a face on the TV, turn it off immediately and take you and Henr\u00ed out of the room. He will go play with his toys in a different room.\n\n5. If Blanche (the blonde one) asks you a question about ghosts, do not make eye contact with her or you will start seeing them too.\n\n6. Merle (the eldest) is a bit violent so please keep all sharp objects away from him or he might hurt the other children.\n\n\n7. The guest room you are sleeping in is upstairs next to Merles room.\n\n8. You may hear someone knocking on your door when you are sleeping. If this happens, go up to the door and say \"ne pas d\u00e9ranger\". The knocking should stop.\n\n9. If you see a tall dark figure in the corner of your eye, do not panic and do not turn around. If you need to turn around, pretend it is not there and do whatever you needed to do.\n\n10. Lastly and this is very important. If the lights around the house begin to glow very bright, you have about two minutes to run to the guest room and lock the door. After locking the door you might hear screaming. Do not worry, *it is not the children*.\n\nThanks again for coming at such short notice.

Apparently, it shut down after a robbery had gone especially wrong, and gotten bloody, leaving 17 people, including the robbers, dead. I had no doubts about whether or not the story was true. I\u2019d heard all about it before. But what I did have doubts about, was the ghosts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Bank had become a pretty popular destination for ghost tours over the past few years.

How absurd, this was how they were gonna kill him? \"They've truly run out of ideas\" the man mocked as he began to lie down. He started to recall all of what he did.

To the child\u2019s small eyes, the hall seemed long and intimidating. He took a deep breath. Grasped the dim flashlight in shaking hands. Then with slow quiet steps, began down the path that stretched before him. The eyes of the paintings followed him, and the faces seemed to darken with disapproval when a particularly loud board creaked its complaints to the ceiling above. The boy tried his best to ignore the gazes upon him, focusing instead on the moon through panes of glass and the comfortingly earthy scent of the walls. The one part of this place that was the same in both light and dark. He made it a quarter of the way, then half. Around three quarters was where trouble began. A scratching along the baseboard sounded before one of the mice the old man insisted didn\u2019t inhabit the old building skittered past. Far too close for comfort. A quiet squeak of fright, that could have almost been mistaken for the mouse itself, escaped him; and that was all it took. The movement of a shadow a few feet behind set his heart pounding and the pained sounds of a small creature caught in the talons of something much larger set his feet flying. More shadows joined the first, contorting and discoloring the paintings they emerged from. He was no longer worried about sound in the desperation to reach the safety of his room. There was no time to spare even for a glance behind him as darkness flooded through the hall, blocking all light from the windows. \n\nFive steps.\n\nFour.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\nThe door slammed behind him and in a moment, he was under the covers, flashlight switched off and clutched to his chest. With a clatter and the wail of a strong wind, the shadows slammed into the door, leaking under, around, through any possible gap in the wood. He closed his eyes and slowed his breathing as the nightlight flickered out, not daring to move until the dim light cast itself over the room again. And with safety assured for one more night, he fell into a fitful sleep.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674723429.0,"comments":[{"author":"housemistress","text":"Beautifully written to be either wholesome (like a child\u2019s imagination walking back from a late night bathroom trip) or possibly something much more sinister.

The host, a mysterious figure known only as \"The Keeper,\" would appear on screen dressed in a long black cloak and hood, his face obscured by shadows. \n\nHe would speak in a deep, eerie voice, welcoming viewers to the show and promising them a glimpse into the unknown. The show's segments included footage of ghostly apparitions, unexplained phenomena, and even alleged demon possessions. Many of the segments were accompanied by a haunting melody that seemed to echo through the viewer's mind long after the show had ended. \n\nThe Keeper would often speak directly to the camera, as if he were speaking directly to the viewer, and his words were always cryptic and unsettling. The station received complaints that some viewers began experiencing strange occurrences in their own lives.  Many reported nightmares, hallucinations, and even physical manifestations of the entities featured on the show.\n\nDespite these reports, the show continued to air, and The Keeper's influence seemed to grow stronger with each passing episode. As the years passed, the show's content became increasingly disturbing, and many viewers were too afraid to watch it. Eventually, the show was pulled off the air, but the legend of The Midnight Hour and The Keeper lived on as urban legends. \n\nSome say you can summon The Keeper by standing in front of a television in the dark and humming the show\u2019s melody.

He couldn't help but weep, arms resting on his knees as he sat against the wall slumped. The thought that death was so close, that he was only a moment away from ending everything. In that moment, Jared realized that despite everything he wanted to live.\n\nWhile he wept, the sound of a door opening quietly went largely unnoticed. However the muffled footsteps of something ominously heavy did not. Jared pulled his head up and wiped away the tears from his cheeks. It took a few seconds for his eyes to adjust to the darkness of the bedroom but Jared wished instantly that they hadn't. What stood before him had no possible explanation.\n\nIt must have stood about eight feet at the shoulder, needed to almost hunch over to fit inside the room. There was this thick bushy material that covered it's entire body except for it's arms and legs which were a lifeless grey. Wrinkled skin that still somehow managed to appear tight wrapped around it's skeleton. What looked like some kind of debris was scattered throughout it's hide. Jared's eyes caught what looked like a femur fragment stuffed deep near the creature's face. Or lack of a face rather, there was no visible head or features besides a greater darkenss where it's eyes should have been. A low growl could be heard coming from where a mouth might logically appear.\n\nThe creature remained perfectly still as Jared sat staring at it. He quickly glancer at the clock above his bed. A quarter past two in the morning. It would be dark for hours more. He turned back and nearly jumped. It stood now less than ten feet away. Jared remembered the revolver, reaching blindly to the box of bullets beside him he loaded the gun. Eyes locked on target. Six shots in and he pointed the weapon at the creature.\n\nFive rapid shots found the beast. Didn't so much as flinch. It even started moving closer to Jared and in that moment he froze. For the first time in months he actually wanted to live and now it turned out that the sounds he'd been hearing from his basement weren't from the drugs. It stood tall over Jared and placed it's cold hands on either side of his head squeezing him gently to tighten it's grip as it prepared to twist. It was going to break his neck. With tears coming Jared closed his eyes and once again pointed the revolver under his chin. The shot rang out right as the creature violently sent it's arms in opposite directions and pulled upwards claiming it's bloody prize.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674699154.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Soul-Power","author":"ForgottenWell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10l51n4\/soulpower\/","text":"In the year 2050, on the brink of an energy crisis, I lead a group of scientists to discover America\u2019s next great source of power: ghosts.\n\nNinety-nine percent of all humans who have ever lived are dead. I mean there are 117,000,000,000 souls out there wandering the planet aimlessly. \n\nDid you know that when you die the energy in your body doesn\u2019t just disappear? Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. The energy in your body just roams the earth endlessly for all time.\n\nWell\u2026 we found a way to capture the energy of ghosts.\n\nYes, ghosts exist, and they can be harvested like wind or the sun for their electricity. I\u2019ll spare you the scientific details. What matters is that in three months time every government on the planet decided that this was the future. In five years time every electrical grid worldwide would be run on soul-power. \n\nThe thought of using up the energy of a human\u2019s soul bothered me, but its potential was limitless! We could make the world a much better place with this seemingly endless supply of energy!\n\nThen we made a devastating discovery\u2026 some souls created more energy than the others.\n\nA human who died happily, with no desires left, produced little energy. There was no power holding his body to the earthly plain.\n\nBut a human who died badly, who died full of hate and longing, clung to this world like a nuclear bomb.\n\nOnce the superpowers of the world discovered that vengeful ghosts produced more energy\u2026 they started mass producing ghosts for themselves.\n\nThey tortured and killed people in awful ways to create terrible, vengeful spirits who could be captured and harvested for their boundless electricity.\n\n.  .  .\n\nSo, there I was, in the midst of a global-power-race, pouring myself a stiff drink, regretting my great discovery.\n\nIn the midst of all my sorrow, a surge of electricity brightened my condo, and a spirit from beyond the grave manifested itself physically in my kitchen.\n\n\u201cI knew this day would come,\u201d I said, taking a sip of bourbon. \u201cAre you here to kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse,\u201d the spirit wheezed. \u201cI\u2019m here to explain what exactly you\u2019ve done.\u201d I squinted and crossed my arms. \u201cI need you to listen to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I\u2019ve done, I made electricity out of souls\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d The spirit became angry. \u201cIt\u2019s much worse than that!\u201d The spirit walked closer to me. \u201cYou\u2019re a scientist! You can understand an equation, yes?\u201d I hesitantly nodded. \u201cThe universe needs balance. Yet you decided you would suck all the dead out of existence\u2026 using their energy to power your microwaves! With all the energy of the dead gone\u2026 the equation is out of balance.\u201d Sirens began to go off in the distance.

Walls upon walls of beakers, chemicals and Bunsen burners. Mr Henry teaches it, and holy cow is it hard. Except for Simon . He aces the class, 100% on all his exams. He rubs it in our faces, constantly asking \u201cHow is it hard? This class is a breeze!\u201d With a smirk on his face.\n\nLast week, Mr Henry was teaching us about some sort of chemical. It was newly discovered and was monumental for the scientific community. When added to water, this chemical would explode. Well, not until after it produced a gas that knocked out anyone who breathed it in. For once, everyone was listening with fascination, but not Simon. He figured we would have a normal lesson today, and skipped class. \n\nSo me and my friend Abby hatched a plan. First we had to get our hands on some of this chemical. Abby knows some people, but that\u2019s none of your business. But 20$ was a great deal for 10 ml. We only need 5, so double the fun.\n\nIt is common knowledge that Simon does experiments of his own in Science Lab B. It is also common knowledge that Mr Henry keeps the keys in his bag.

Abby hung outside Simons locker, and when he came she began talking to him about the non-existent Math homework, which put him into a panic and bought me an extra 2 minutes. Thanks Abby. \n\nI found some beakers set up on the table in the Lab. I carefully smeared the chemical on the inside, which only left a faint tint of purple. Only 1 minute later, I had left and Simon entered. I locked the door and put on a mask for good measure. \n\nSimon filled the beaker with water and me and Addy got to watch him panic as he saw the purple smoke fill the air around him. He banged on the door in a futile attempt at escape, and passed out. 3,2,1. \nBANG\n\nThe entire Lab exploded, launching Simon forward and onto the door. The blood spilled all over it.

Then I waited, just long enough, and moved quietly around to the back. I knew where the accessible rooms were; this wasn't my first visit.\n\nI cracked the window, slid it up slowly, carefully, and pulled myself up over the sill. I could see the woman laying on the bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me back up a little. \n\nI've been doing this for a while now - I started later in life when I was in my 40s. I'm well over 50 now. It does wear on me, to be honest. I'm still very fit but not as agile as I used to be. Being older is a bit of a superpower though - I am noticed a lot less, and can follow my targets much more easily. \n\nI do remember my first, they say you never forget that one, don't they? It was almost accidental - I had no plans to do anything, I'm not that kind of person, at least I thought I wasn't. But an opportunity presented itself, and.. well, I took it.\n\nI was in a bar and noticed a woman who I thought was drunk but thinking back she'd only had 1 drink and when she'd come in, she'd acted normally. When she left, moments later, she could barely walk.\n\nI followed her. Don't ask me WHY, I just felt a compulsion. \n\nBy the way, did you know that that Sawzall thing is incredibly versatile? It cuts through bone like butter -  OK maybe like butter with a bone in it, but still - it truly is amazing. Not that I enjoy that part of things - but one has to be tidy if one wants to avoid the long arm of the law.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd stalked this one for a couple of weeks. Learned patterns, scoped out the house, just waiting for the perfect situation. \n\nNow it was time. \n\nI slunk into the bedroom, keeping to the shadows as much as possible although I was fairly sure she'd heard me. Her head was moving back and forth trying to pinpoint whatever sound I'd made. I smiled to myself.\n\nThen the bedroom door opened and a man came in.\n\nThe woman now looked terrified as I snuck up on silent feet behind the man - and slid my stiletto blade in between his ribs.\n\nHe hardly made a sound as he crumpled lifeless to the floor.\n\nIt didn't take long to cut the woman free.\n\nShe wasn't his first. I explained to her his history of assaults and attacks while we cleaned up. \n\nThe neighbors wouldn't notice his absence for a long time, as he was often away 'traveling'.\n\nI made her promise that she wouldn't report this but in any case who would believe that a respectable older woman, like myself, had broken in and killed her attacker and then spirited the body away?\n\nSounds made up.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674593999.0,"comments":[{"author":"The_Ambling_Horror","text":"Awww, something wholesome.","upvotes":107,"created_utc":1674604918.0},{"author":"Reddd216","text":"Ooooo...really nice twist.","upvotes":62,"created_utc":1674597641.0},{"author":"HECK_OF_PLIMP","text":"omfg OP I love you. keep doing what you're doing, and get on a supplement regimen to prevent osteoporosis!","upvotes":39,"created_utc":1674608804.0},{"author":"wulfinn","text":"man i have read so much horror from the perspective of the killer lately and there is so much barely cloaked misogyny. i was really hoping the twist was what i thought it was about halfway through :)","upvotes":22,"created_utc":1674628723.0},{"author":"Multiverse_Queen","text":"I was expecting some kinda twist but not that one.

Even if it's a generic question like \"do you want to go to the restaurant?\" The answer will always be five. Life is so easy when I realised that everything equals to five and I wish I had known sooner. I have been tutoring another child and I have been teaching him my realisation. I have been telling him that everything equals to five. I have been preparing him for school exams and I have been telling him to put the number five down for every question. The student has been rebelling against me and it has been annoying me so much. The student doesn't believe that everything equals to the number five. \n\nI have been heavily indoctrinating him that everything equals to five. I would mark his papers and he would put other numbers or answers on the paper. I am disgruntled with him but then my student got it, that everything equaled to five. My student realised how easy everything is when everything equals to five. He found that he didn't have to remember or revise for anything, as the answer was always five. He even did mock exams at night clubs where his mother is a stripper at the night club, and he got full marks as he put the number five down. \n\nI was so proud of him for finally seeing the light and at school, where my student gets severely bullied for being a stripper, he just gives the answer 5 to all of thier mocking sexual indoic questions about his stripper mom. His life has been made so easy when he can just answer everything by giving the number five. I am so proud of my student for finally getting it and before he was truly struggling to put the answer five for every question, now it's just instinctive. It so good when a student finally learns something. \n\nSo when I murdered five people in five separate streets during the course of a month, I blamed it on my student. When the police asked him how many people he had killed, he simply gave the answer five. When they asked how many different streets he had murdered on, my students reply was five. Any other question they asked my student was simply five. My student didn't get sent to prison but he got sent to a place for mentally ill people. \n\nHe still gives the answer five to any question that comes his way. Recently I have had another great realisation, every answer actually equals ten. Now I have got another student coming to me for private tuition, I will make that student realise that everything equals to ten.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674661484.0,"comments":[{"author":"PurifiedWaterdrops","text":"What a plot twist!

My bedroom was still dark but seemed unusually quiet. The house was eerily silent. No hum of appliances, no sounds from outside. I got out of bed and hit the light switch. Nothing. In rural Florida power outages were not uncommon and would explain the silence. I grabbed my flashlight and tried to turn it on. Nothing. I grabbed my peacekeeper from my nightstand, ignoring the pounding of my heart I began to explore my home. I made it to my living room when I first heard it. A low growl. A warning. I clicked the safety off and tried to get my eyes to adjust to the darkness. The growling became louder. No longer a warning, a full threat. Beginning to panic I fired two rounds in the direction of the growling. \nThat was a mistake \nWhatever it was it was pissed. I felt it rush towards me. I turned and ran back to my bedroom. It's breath hot on my back and just as I reached my door I felt a hot searing pain on my back as a claw made contact. I slammed my door and pressed myself against it to keep it shut. The creature continued its slams into my door. I closed my eyes as fear flooded my body. As I prayed that the door would hold I heard a chirping.

You can tell if one is close by because the already rancid smell gets rancid-er. Zombies don\u2019t make an awful lot of noise. Not more than you\u2019d expect from a racoon or another poor survivor anyway. You don\u2019t tend to see them coming either.

There was a sudden shift in the air and the oxygen to dead-people-particles ratio became more dead-people than oxygen than it was before. All of us went on high alert, anticipating a stinking zombie to pop its head out from behind a bush at any second. But there was nothing. Eerie silence telling us we were very much alone.\n\nA couple of days ago, there was this noise. A weird rumbling echo that seemed to come from all directions. We all had theories. A powerline, an engine kicked into gear by another survivor, the wind\u2026positive thinking right?\n\nYesterday we saw them. A dark shadow pooling over the horizon in every direction.

He\u2019d had a bad day, he just needed something to make him feel better, so he had decided to invite this woman he had a thing for over to his house.\n\nThey had already gotten down with each other. It was way past midnight; she was asleep and he forgot to feed the thing living in his basement. You see, he had a monster trapped underneath the house, a floating head, a big one.\n\nThis floating head barely resembled a human one, it looked deformed and putrefied. With a skin matching the color of rotten meat and a sinister look in its tiny eyes. The thing craved sustenance, it screamed and cackled, almost to the point of torturing its jailer, but it never fully begged, knowing that its presence alone would eventually take his mind to the breaking point.\n\n1:00 AM hit and the head started to scream, it tried to make itself sound like a human, but it could never get the pitch right. The jailer knew he had about an hour before the thing got tired of waiting for food and actually got out.\n\nIn the back of his head, he always knew that he had no control over it, that the only reason that it stayed trapped was because it was comfortable in making him miserable. It wasn\u2019t a jailer and a prisoner, it was a tortured man and a torturer; and if this thing, this inhuman thing had nothing to torture, when it escaped it would become a true monster.\n\nHe looked at the woman by his side, for a desperate moment he thought of killing her to save his own life. After taking a deep breath he regretted thinking like that in the first place, and got out of bed without waking her up, she deserved better than this.\n\nAfter gathering everything he had in the kitchen, he put all the food in a big dumbwaiter installed for this very purpose. Inch by inch, he lowered the food down to the basement. At first, it was quiet, but soon enough the sounds of bones crunching and meat sloshing around could be heard, along with the delighted laughter of the floating head.\n\nSilence once again took a hold of the house. A broken voice harshly made its way up the dumbwaiter shoot.\n\n***~~\u201cYOU ARE GETTING SLOW--- HAHAHAHA\u2026...DO NOT MAKE ME WAIT AGAIN OR I\u2019LL EAT HER TOO\u201d~~***\n\nThe tortured man looked tired as he raised up the dumbwaiter. He didn\u2019t even know how the head found out about the woman he cared about. He climbed the stairs and went back to bed.\n\nHe closed his eyes; thinking that there would be nights full of loneliness, some nights for only reflection, but the pain would be never-ending.\n\nHe fell asleep, waiting for another night to pass.\n\n\\-----------------","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674593757.0,"comments":[{"author":"MgBot172","text":"Fun fact: I didn't know that food elevators were usually called dumbwaiters.\n\nAnyway, hope you liked the story","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1674593860.0}]},{"title":"Resusci Anne","author":"JustARandomBeee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10k9bj3\/resusci_anne\/","text":"\u2018Right here is a CPR doll\u2014also known as a Resusci Anne, here for today\u2019s demonstration.

We\u2019d live primitively and would hike from point A to point B on a map throughout the week. There were no roads, only game trails sometimes.\n\nWe began our long trek at the start of the week towards a place called 'indian camp,' a red-rock deserty river bed that usually had water in it. Every night I'd stay up a few hours after everyone went to bed, writing logs and keeping watch over the camp. Usually I'd sit facing the fire\u2026. But every night during that hike, as I stared toward the fire, the hair on my neck would stand up; as if eyes in the dark were staring at me.\n\nI began sitting with my back to the fire, as was accustomed in areas with higher bear activity. I assumed there were simply nocturnal eyes in the black of night, passing by or meandering. These feelings would never leave during the night, even when I tried to go to sleep. It came to my attention during a powow with the other guides that we all felt something was following us and watching us. They all had the same experiences as I did during their night watches.\n\nThen, the night we finally made it to Indian Camp, I had a strange encounter as I was trying to sleep a little ways away from the other campers. I set up my shelter behind a few trees about 50 feet from the fire.\n\nIt's important to note, we had an alumni with very long hair, and who was rather tall. He was a funny man, and kind of awkward. So my night watch ended and I tucked myself into my sleeping bag. I remember glancing over to my other coworker who sat writing her own notes at the fire. I closed my eyes, restless. An hour must have passed already, when suddenly, this heavy terror intruded my body and shocked me fully alert. Footsteps crunched from behind the trees I slep next to.\n\nI shot my head out of my sleeping bag and saw that same long haired alumni walking by. He seemed taller than usual and his hair draped over his face.\n\n\"Hey!\" I called out.\n\n\"Oh!\" He grunted, stumbling back behind a few large bushes.\n\nI stated. \"Sorry man, you startled me.\"\n\nOnly a bleak silhouette of his head could be seen behind the bush. His eyes gleamed dimly like an owl's.\n\nHe stayed silent for a moment before he crept a little lower behind the bush and muttered gibberish. He sounded a little different than the alumni but I didn't think much of it.

I am obsessed with banshees and thier screaming when someone is about to die. I know what banshees tend to look like, which is usually an elderly woman in white clothing. I remember seeing an elderly looking woman in white clothings, and I ran up to her with a knife in my hand, the knife was for my own protection. Then to my pleasing this elderly looking woman was actually a banshee, as she started screaming. She screamed so loud and I asked her who was about to die. \n\nThis elderly woman just ran off and I was so pleased to have found an actual banshee. I was determined to find another one again, to my surprise it wasn't long till another banshee. She was another elderly looking woman in white clothings, I got my knife ready for protection. I sprinted up to her and grabbed her and she screamed so loud. I had found another banshee and I tried getting answers out of her like who was going to die, but she kept on screaming. She ran off as well and I couldn't believe that I had found a banshee, it's absolutely fantastic. \n\nThen I found a hive of banshees in one building and there were so many old looking women in white clothings. I went in there with a knife in my hand and they started screaming. I couldn't believe I had found so many banshees, at the same time the old looking men were also screaming. I never knew banshees could be men and learning this new information was highly riveting. I love searching for banshees and I can't believe how easy they are to find. I want to leave my job and become a full time banshee finder. \n\nI was thinking of documenting each one that I find, so people know what to look out for. Then one night I heard a scream and it was definitely the scream of a banshee. There was an old woman screaming and this banshee was screaming because death had found a man, being shot to death. So then that incident gave me a new idea to find banshees.\n\nWith my knife I started attacking people and the screams came instantly from all over the place. I came to find out that banshees were in all shapes and sizes. Some banshees were children, some were men, some were even animals. I'm getting over whelmed with all these banshee stuff, then a thought came over me, what if they are just normal people screaming out of fear.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1674575019.0,"comments":[{"author":"Mimi_315","text":"Haha loved this, really clever and well written!","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1674583875.0},{"author":"ouchiethathurts","text":"I can always tell when a story is by you- frantic writing\/ stream of consciousness.

He had become fatigued with the banality and cruelty of people, his profession being one that caused him to endure their wickedness daily. When early retirement was offered the bachelor sold his London home for a handsome sum and purchased a bungalow in a sequestered corner of the Outer Hebrides.\n\nIn the early days, the quiet of North Uist was unsettling. The previous years spent absorbing the noise and violence of London had trained his spirit to perceive any silence as suspicious. In time he learnt to savour the solitude and tranquillity of the island, spending many a comfortable evening at the fire accompanied by a book, a pipe and a bottle of Drambuie.\n\nThe only concern he had was the mound on the pasture beyond his walled garden.\n\nThe islanders told him it was simply the ground pushing the dead and buried back to the surface; a humorous untruth admitted as much one evening in the tavern. No, the mound was just the work of wee beasties over the years, the barman reassured him.\n\nAt first Manston thought it was a barrow. After all, he had spotted many cairns on Uist on his walks. These stacks of piled stone, conical and megalithic were often painted or decorated for remembrance. Tributes to the deceased were hardly uncommon on the island.\n\nThe mound was a curious thing and Manston climbed atop it one afternoon, estimating it to be a good ten feet high. He hastily climbed down when he felt himself start to sink.\n\nThe next morning he noticed the mound had grown in height by at least two feet. Manston thought it uncanny and decided to measure the mound every day. Wee beasties indeed!\n\nOn Tuesday it had only increased by three inches; Wednesday by five. Thursday it was sixteen feet high.\n\nResolved to determine what army of moles, badgers or *Negotium Perambulans* were the cause of all this, he placed tall, freestanding candles around the mound. Manston hoped to illuminate the animal responsible and then formulate the best plan to dispose of it.\n\nAround midnight he heard something coming from the mound. Manston approached quietly, a liturgical torch gripped firmly in his left hand.\n\nHe stood still, an equal measure of trepidation and excitement coursing through him.\n\nThen it broke through.\n\nA multitude of white spindly arms appeared, flailing wildly in the cold night air.\n\nAs the emaciated, ragged creature pulled itself out of the ground Manston held his breath. The thing looked eternally starved.\n\nIt spotted him immediately.\n\nBefore he could react, Manston was snatched away and taken deep within the mound. He screamed as he was dragged along dark, slimy tunnels carpeted with bones.\n\n\u2013\n\nThe islanders arrived at Manston's a week later. Their herds would be safe again for a few months while the creature feasted on the poor newcomer.\n\nThe bungalow was emptied of all its belongings and put up for sale the very same day.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674517549.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"Very nice indeed!","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1674522247.0},{"author":"Scarabium","text":"Visit r\/scarabium for all my tales.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1674517602.0},{"author":"Diligent-Picture2882","text":"Keeping the community thriving!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1674568344.0},{"author":"Little_Somerled","text":"Somehow this reminds me of some of the short horror stories written by Robert E.

Her parents had died when she was a girl. War had crippled her. Yet she had opposed leaving Russia to the last hour, and it had pained her daily to see my grandfather toil for the benefit of men who mocked and mistreated him.\n\nIn her final years, she considered it a neverending insult to have descendants as thoroughly Americanized as we.\n\nBut even I did not realize the bitterness and acidity she had accumulated. Although we knew she did not have friends or happiness in the United States, not even I could have imagined the power and depth of her hatred, or predicted its devastating consequences.\n\nAlthough my grandmother had few possessions when she died, and there was consequently little interest in her will, she left to me what she had cherished most, her collection of rare books. It was there that I discovered a letter inscribed with my name, to be opened upon her death.\n\nI did so immediately following the cremation. The letter contained the following instruction: \"Scatter my ashes on Liberty Island.\"\n\nThis required a permit and I applied for one.\n\nIt was days later, while seated on a white ferry crossing calm inland waters, holding the urn containing her ashes, surrounded by tourists, that grief hit me hardest, and it was then I truly said goodbye.\n\nAfter we landed, I recited a prayer, opened the urn and let the winds take her remains.\n\nI closed my eyes.\n\nAnd opened them to: tourists gathering around me, speaking, gasping, and pointing at the Statue of Liberty, around whose base my grandmother's ashes swirled, a dark buzzing cloud, rising and rising until the entire figure was cloaked\u2014\n\nA cloak which fell away like sand revealing:\n\n*Emptiness.*\n\nThe Statue of Liberty was gone.\n\nDevoured by the ashes, which had grown in volume and were accelerating, circling the island like a runaway ribbon of death as we stood stunned with phones in outstretched hands, before condensing into a black sphere and shooting across the bay toward Manhattan.\n\nThe rest I remember from news footage and YouTube:\n\nAshes looming over downtown like a storm cloud;\u00a0\n\nDescending like fog;\n\nConsuming skyscrapers, vehicles, people\u2014\n\nuntil they were all emptiness and New York City itself was but a vacancy beneath a cosmic blanket. Then too that blanket fell, smothering whatever life remained and settling into an eerie wasteland, an earthen scar where nothing grows, the wind never blows, and my grandmother's ashes lie dormant in a gray and hateful peace.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674506595.0,"comments":[{"author":"normancrane","text":"Thanks for reading.\n\n[Index](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/normancrane\/comments\/j23dbt\/table_of_contents\/) of stories at [r\/normancrane](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/normancrane)!","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1674506901.0},{"author":"jill2019","text":"Fantastic read NC, original too.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1674519518.0},{"author":"S4njay","text":"Woooo!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674553707.0},{"author":"Bugley15","text":"Great \ud83d\udc4d","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674577800.0}]},{"title":"You know them","author":"heartphoneband","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10jxvw7\/you_know_them\/","text":"You walk into a coffee shop. \u201cHey!\u201d You exclaim as you see An acquaintance from work sitting at the bar, no response.

Pillars of metal engulfed barren drought-ridden land in stark reminder of the ancient world that once was. \n     Bodies of green water inhabited the area to the west and east of Var\u2019noth.

The black trees were assymetrical and bent disproportionately. Acid rain covered Var\u2019noth in the weekly storm, taking with it any leaves unfortunate enough to be struck with the rain. Winged beasts found shelter lest they match those fallen leaves. \n     In the vast desert, the winged demon known only as Keeper approached his cave of concrete. He was the keeper of knowledge for he was the oldest and most ancient among their people. \n\n\u201cTell me demon,\u201d he said, \u201cof the ones who built this world.

On the side of the mountains, ancient symbols were carved. The symbol resembled an apple, known today by a different name, with a bite taken out of it in a clear glass rectangle. The demon and his companion made their journey through the valley of steel and fire with a newly found purpose.

Summer was almost over and I could leave the night shift behind when I left for college. It was midnight on my 6th night in a row, and the store was dead - just the way I liked it.\n\n\nI remember my eyes half shut when a family came in, like a storm ready to fuck up my solitude. It was common to see chubby families with Mickey Mouse ears, haggard after a 9 hour car ride. With kids screaming like demon spawn, parents stocked up on marlboros or jolt cola before the next agonizing leg of the journey home.\n\n\nThis family was no different, although they probably left their mouse ears in their dodge caravan. There was fat Dad, exhausted Mom, bitchy teenage Sister and 3rd grade Boy. No talking; only small murmurs, the crackle of chip bags and sneakers squeaking.\u00a0\n\n\nDad and Daughter started talking. I couldn't hear well, but it sounded like things were heated. Mom had to come over.\n\n\n\"Fuck you. I'm fucking exhausted. I don't want sugary shit. I'm outta here!\" She stormed off, nearly breaking the glass door on her way out.\n\n\nDad's face was red and swollen as he strode after her. \"You don't talk to me that way, you spoiled little brat.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\"Howard, stop!\" Mom fluttered after her raging husband. Both left the store in a huff.\n\n\nIt was just me and the Boy now. He seemed unphased by the tornado that just blew past the sunglasses and magazines. He turned to me.\n\n\nHe said, \"I'm Ricky. You got Pokemon cards?\"\n\n\nI smiled. It was pretty cool the kid dug Pokemon as much as I did.\n\n\nFrom his pocket, he whipped out his favourite card: a crumpled Raichu. I told him about my collection at home, including my Shiny Charizard (I didn't have one, I just wanted him to think I was cool). His jaw dropped. I liked this kid.\n\n\nThe door swung open. Dad, Mom and Sister walked in. No more red faces. In fact, not much of anything. They just walked in, and stood. They all stared clear across the store, until Dad turned towards Ricky and I.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Boy,\" he said. But it didn't sound like him. It sounded more like a hiss. \"Come, boy.\"\n\n\nI felt my spine shiver.\u00a0\n\n\nBut Ricky didn't care. \"See ya later, dude.\" He turned and left with his family.\n\n\nI don't know why, but I almost didn't want to let him go. Something just felt off, but I just believed they got some bad news and were in shock.\u00a0\n\n\nBut when I left the store in the morning, I noticed their van in the parking lot. No one was there. I shivered, but brushed it off and went home.\n\n\nRicky, I hope you're okay, buddy.\n\n\nEdit: I'm not sure if this matters, but this happened in Arizona, near one of the Navajo Reservations.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674515848.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"I have a feeling Ricky is okay.

Never seen that before.\u201d\n\nI never thought I\u2019d live in the apartments overlooking the cemetery, but here I was: living in the corner apartment on the top floor overlooking a graveyard.

No job, no money, no house, wife gone, kicked out the family house with my daughter.\n\nWe were out on the streets together, scavenging for things to sell at the recycling center. It was a cold January, and the winds bit deep into my face. My daughter sneezed, wrapping my oversized jacket tighter around herself. She was deep in the trash, her frosted fingers digging out old plastic bottles. Just as she tumbled back down into the snow a gnarly, grizzled hand tapped my shoulder.\n\nIt was impossible to describe what he looked like. He was tall and bundled up tight in his coat\u2013but his face was full of scars and wrinkles. He stared at us with gray eyes, haunted shadows dancing from within.\n\n\u201cTake this,\u201d he wheezed, shoving something red in my hands. Then he scurried away and disappeared into the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d my daughter asked, crowding in close. I looked at it closely, turning it over and over in my hands. Then my childhood memories hit me like a truck and I broke into tears.\n\nIt was a red envelope\u2013an ang bao. When I was a kid I used to love getting them. It meant a little extra pocket money in those little red envelopes, *just* enough to afford a toy or sweet I could never get otherwise.\n\nI hadn\u2019t gotten one in years.\n\n\u201cDaddy?\u2019 said my daughter. She sounded far away.\n\nWordlessly I reached inside the ang bao, hoping for a good haul. The flap nuzzled warmly against my skin. I felt the money and drew it out. Then I dropped it in shock, spilling cash all over the pavement.\n\nThe ang bao was full of hundred-dollar notes. Looking down, I couldn\u2019t tell how many there were. Ten, twenty, maybe a hundred\u2026\n\nMy daughter squealed.\n\n\u201cDaddy! We\u2019re gonna be rich!\u201d\n\nAnd before I could stop her she had taken a handful of bills and dashed across the road to the bank opposite.\n\nA semi-truck was barreling in from the other side. I screamed her name.\n\nBut it was too late. I couldn\u2019t watch. I turned away, but I could still hear bones cracking under the weight. \n\n***\n\nI didn\u2019t want to know how much the hospital bill was. The figures blurred before my eyes. I just pulled out money and threw it on the reception desk until it was nearly empty. Then I stormed out of the hospital and glared at it in disgust. It shimmered like red rubies and the design morphed into a taunting face.\n\nIt was laughing as new notes appeared inside.\n\n\u201cStupid thing,\u201d I muttered, throwing the ang bao on the ground and quickly walking away. At the corner of my eye I could see a tramp scurry over and pick it up. His long, thin fingers caressed the ruby paper, and his eyes lit up in longing.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t had one of these in years\u2026\u201d","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674477128.0,"comments":[{"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","text":"Second day of CNY, hope everyone\u2019s ang baos are full with money!\n\nRing in more fortune at r\/SimbaKingdom and [SUBSCRIBE HERE FOR NEW STUFF](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=UpdateMeBot&subject=Subscribe&message=SubscribeMe%21%20%2Fr%2Fshortscarystories%20%2Fu%2FSimbaTheSavage8)!\n\nStay spooky everyone!\n\nEdit:\n\n[Picture of Ang Bao for people who have never seen one before.

Glacial streams cascaded into icy pools of clear water. It was a pristine wilderness teeming with life.\n\nThe forest was empty of people, however. Not a soul entered. Not to hunt, not to fish, and not to gather firewood. \n\nThere was only one being left in the forest. True, she had once been human, but that had been so long ago. \n\nThe creature was old, and as the last of her kind she lived in quiet isolation. Her bones ached and her teeth were soft. These days she ate berries and mushrooms as much as she did corpses.\n\nNow there were so few of them each year. The villagers rarely sacrificed to the forest anymore. \n\nThat morning the creature was foraging silently among the trees when she was startled by two children, a boy and a girl, gathering firewood. \n\nTheir soft round eyes and silky hair identified them as the children of immigrants. They had to be; no villager would dream of sending a child here. The newly arrived foreigners, however, were unfamiliar with the local customs.\n\nThe creature licked her lips. It had been so long since she'd had children. She eyed their fresh faces, their plump arms. The forest would sing with such a pure blood offering.\n\nNeither of them had seen her. She dealt with the boy first. She watched dispassionately as his face turned purple and the light faded from his eyes. \n\nThen she turned to the girl. \n\nThe child babbled frightfully in an incomprehensible language. The creature wondered if she had looked this helpless the day she was chosen. Perhaps not. She reached out and took the girl's hand reassuringly, and led her towards a hovel deep in the woods.\n\nShe'd come back for the boy later. Once she completed the ritual his remains would make a fine stew.\n\nThe girl offered so many other possibilities\u2026","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674491678.0,"comments":[{"author":"justaqueershark","text":"ah, ok then good story a bit confusing but I like that it includes a village with rituals etc.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1674498025.0},{"author":"sunshine_dreaming","text":"Feel free to check out my other stories [HERE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SunshineScarystories\/comments\/x88quz\/story_index\/)","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1674491897.0},{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Particularly love the ending because there act are so many possibilities!

Most people have to go to thier hobbies, but mine comes to me. I can induce a heart attack or something could come at me and give me a heart attack. \n\nI also have a friend who enjoys having kidney stones and he loves the feeling of when a stone is passing. We both have something in common as we both love the feeling of our ailments. Is it really an ailment if you love having it? and is it worth going to a doctor if you love the sickness that you have? We both sit together when our ailments are having a flare up. While I am having a heart attack, my friend will be opposite me enjoying kidney stones. \n\nIt's good to have someone who enjoys their ailments as much as I do. I have had conversations with people while having a hart attack, and when they phoned the ambulance, I was so angry because they ruined the fun of having a heart attack. I shouted at them when they phone the ambulance when I am having a heart attack. Same with my friend and when he was enjoying having kidney stones, he was rushed to hospital and when he was operated on, he was so upset. I know how strange it can be to enjoy a heart attack or kidney stones, but me and my friend can literally sit together while I am having a heart attack and while he is have a stone passing. \n\nI found another guy recently who enjoys being dead.

It all started in 2040 I know doesn\u2019t seem like much could happen in 5 years, but things escalated quickly. \n     We've managed to make it off of Earth, and even though there aren't many of us we all have a strong will to make it out of this. After only 3 years off of our original planet, we found what we thought could be our new home. \n     During the first year here on this planet we've dubbed \u201cNew Hope\u201d things seemed pretty calm. We were able to successfully grow a few crops and find some materials to build us a small home. \n     We then stumbled upon some living organisms that aren't human-like whatsoever. They are much taller than all of us, their \u201cskin\u201d in a deep red, and they have glowing yellow eyes. They seem friendly enough but we kept our distance. \n     I\u2019m now hearing this strange clicking sound at night and I\u2019m not sure what to make of it. The new life we\u2019ve named \u201cGlows\u201d haven\u2019t made contact and we haven\u2019t seen them in months. The year is now 2047, and a few of our original members have passed away due to stress and trauma from our trip. \n     Two of our members went out to scout days ago and have yet to return. I\u2019ve tried convincing the others to help me look for them, but they all seem to have no interest in doing so. I\u2019m still hearing that clicking sound, and I have been for going on three weeks now. \n     I just know the \u201cGlows\u201d have something to do with the disappearances that have been going on there are only four of us left now. Things are looking dim and that clicking is getting louder, it's now happening during the day as well. \n     They've found our home, and are now hunting us. I think they've killed one of us already, we scattered as soon as they showed up. I'm running as fast as I can back to the ship. The clicking is almost bursting my eardrums now. It hurts, but I can see the ship. \n     I've finally made it to the ship and got the hatch closed trying to take off now, but the engine won't seem to start. I can see one other member of our original group running towards the ship but behind him are those things. I can't risk opening the hatch those things would surely make it inside before I could get it closed. \n     It\u2019s to late the ship won\u2019t start I\u2019m the last surviving member of the group it\u2019s all over, all of our pain and suffering is over, the heartache of watching our families parish on Earth and not making it out on time.

He didn't last long, contemplating the knife buried in his stomach and watching the blood coming out of his body, the other thing besides me and him that could still move.\n\nDuring that time, I looked for the watch to see if I could bring the time back to normal, and when I found it, the object was broken, the glass shattered and the pieces apart from each other.

Think about it, hard.\n\nWhat have you arrived at? If your mind moved past swords, clubs, and firearms, and towards more creative answers \u2013 hazardous chemicals, gases, and bombs \u2013 you\u2019re heading in the right direction.\n\n*80,460*\n\nI never dwelt on what my less-than-legitimate clients did with the weapons I sold them. I only cared about what they paid me in exchange. Indeed, when Ralph first convinced me that he was *for real* - that his idea actually *worked* - all I could imagine were suitcases filled with banded stacks of hundred-dollar bills.\n\nYou see, Ralph invented something remarkable, something every client of mine would bend over backwards to purchase: the most intimidating, terrifying weapon ever created.\n\n*80,461*\n\nWhen Ralph first showed me the \u201cTemporal Distortion Projector,\u201d as he called it, I wasn\u2019t impressed. The rifle\u2019s exposed wire and frail frame made it look fragile and unfinished.\n\nI remained skeptical as he led me to a greenhouse adjacent to his lab and aimed his shoddy contraption at dense, brightly-colored flower patch. When he pulled the trigger, the weapon emitted in a brief flash several thin circles of cobalt blue.\n\nWithin moments, the flowers wilted and decayed into a thin, colorless heap until they were nothing but food for fungi and worms.\n\n*80,462*\n\nYou see, among other effects, the weapon stagnates its targets' temporal properties. What Ralph and I observed over seconds, the flowers spent years experiencing. Over five-hundred years, Ralph estimated.\n\nNow, just imagine this weapon used against a living being, against *you*. The first thing you notice is the nerve paralysis. Then, the nightmare sets in, and there\u2019s no escaping it. All you can do is think. And believe me, you have a *long* time to think.\n\nThe world around you freezes. As roughly three seconds pass to everyone in it, your alert mind and immobile body experience the same duration that separates Joan of Arc from fighter jets.

A murder had taken place, and everyone was a suspect.\n\nDetective Jameson was called in to investigate the case. He was a seasoned detective, known for his sharp mind and keen observation skills. As he walked through the corridors of the asylum, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He knew that this case would be a difficult one, as the suspects were all patients suffering from various mental disorders.\n\nThe victim was Dr. Elizabeth Jenkins, the head of the asylum, who was found dead in her office with a knife in her back. The staff and patients had all been questioned, but none of them had seen or heard anything suspicious. But as Jameson delved deeper into the case, he began to uncover a web of secrets and lies surrounding the asylum and its inhabitants.\n\nHe interviewed the staff, starting with the head nurse, who had a contentious relationship with the victim. He also talked to the patients, many of whom had grudges against the victim. But none of them seemed to have a real motive for the murder.\n\nAs he continued to investigate, Jameson discovered that the asylum had been involved in unethical practices, such as experimenting on patients without their consent and falsifying records. He also found out that the victim had been involved in these practices and had been blackmailing some of the staff to keep quiet.\n\nJameson knew that he was getting closer to the truth, but he still had no real suspect. That is until he talked to one of the patients, a man named Jack, who had been in the asylum for years and had been considered harmless. Jack revealed that he had overheard the victim arguing with someone on the night of the murder, and had seen the person leaving her office just before the murder took place.\n\nJameson knew that he had his suspect, and he confronted the person Jack had seen leaving the victim's office, the asylum's financial manager, who had been embezzling money from the asylum and had been threatened to be exposed by the victim. The financial manager finally confessed to the murder in a fit of desperation and rage.\n\nJameson had solved the case, but the investigation had taken its toll on him. He had uncovered a web of lies, secrets, and betrayals that had been brewing within the tight-knit community of the asylum for years. But now, justice had been served, and the killer was behind bars.\n\nAs Jameson left the asylum, he couldn't help but feel a sense of closure and satisfaction. He had solved the case and brought the killer to justice, but he knew that the memory of this case would stay with him forever.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1674485032.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Dinner is ready!","author":"EaternallyHungryy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10ij0yt\/dinner_is_ready\/","text":"Too lazy to study, you entertained yourself with an arcade game on your phone.

I finished with the article early, so I was free to go!\u201d your mother called up. \u201cNow, come on! I made us some meatloaf!\u201d\n\nSure enough, you began recognizing the scent that had been making you hungry for the past 20 minutes. It was the smell of your mother\u2019s meatloaf. \n\nSuddenly, the phone in your hand began vibrating. Your mom was calling.\n\n\u201cNo need to call me, I\u2019m coming!\u201d you answered.\n\nBut before your mother even began speaking, you knew something was wrong. There was a lot of background sound where she was; people talking, engines running.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about!?\u201d your mother said through the phone. \n\n\u201cWh-,\u201d you gulped, trying to get yourself together. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d \n\n\u201cAt the mechanics. I just called to tell you that I\u2019ll be late tonight. The car broke down. Order take-out, okay hun?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cY-yeah, of course. Just studying\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, well remember to give yourself a break.

You gulped, trying to keep your nerves together as you gave the woman your address. \n\n\u201cTry your best to hide and wait, ok? No matter what, don\u2019t leave your room until the police officer comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hang up on me\u2026\u201d you whispered, crawling toward the window, and sitting down.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t, don\u2019t worry. Just stay calm and take deep breaths. And don\u2019t talk unless necessary.\u201d\n\nYou spent the next few minutes doing as instructed. But it was easier said than done. Each deep breath was followed by a sob you barely could control.\n\n\u201cWhen will they be here?\u201d you finally whispered.\n\n\u201cThey are right there. Just hang on tight.\u201d\n\nYou nodded, closing your eyes, counting in your head. Once you got to 150, you suddenly heard your front door being barged open.\n\n\u201cPolice! Put your hands up!\u201d \n\nYour heart raced as you jumped up, running towards the door. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!! Help!!\u201d you shouted. \n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t have opened the door.\n\nIn front of you was a figure so horrendous, it was a combination of everyone\u2019s nightmares. It looked down at you with its distorted smile and hungry eyes.

Even though I felt like I was being flayed from the inside out. I believed them until today, when I woke up and I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t see. I couldn\u2019t feel a single thing. The sudden disappearance of all of my senses is what terrified me, and the fact that horrified appeared to be the only thing I could actually feel.   \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSuddenly there was light and I was staring at the ceiling of my bedroom. And then I was looking at the walls, down at my arms and my hands and my fingers as they were bought closer to my eyes, as if they were being studied, turned and moved and flexed like the hand had never been used before. I was not doing this, but there I was watching myself. I could not feel a fucking thing.   \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAnd as my body got out of bed, clumsily walked its way to the bathroom banging my shoulder on the wall and stubbing my toe on the door frame, I saw everything happening pierced by black flashes.

I try to do it, but the flashes don\u2019t align with my efforts.   \n\n &nbsp;\n\n\nI stood before myself in the mirror, and I waved back at myself.

I always thought being together was enough to keep us warm from the cold of reality. \n\nI feel like I never managed to tell her how much I really loved her, she knew I did, but that\u2019s not sufficient consolation to wash away my sorrow. If being at her side felt like the sun warming the beach sand, then loneliness like flowers in winter\u2026\n\nCold and dead until spring. A spring that will never come back.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to keep her alive in my thoughts. I could not save her from the illness she faced but at least I could save me from myself. My life had become a downward spiral, everything seemed to freeze, and time  numbed itself to the point of not being bearable to me anymore. \n\nWhen she was alive, we bought a lovely little cottage in the nearby forest, nice place with everything you needed to survive. Winter was near and I decided that going there was a good way to get away from everything.\n\nPacked up some things I needed. Enough canned food to last me the season, extra heather, a spare generator, and matches in case a fire needed to be lit. I had electricity, plumbing, and Wi-Fi already so I thought that this would be a very relaxing experience; no need to worry anymore.\n\nAnd so, winter started. The cold settled in; a cold that got stronger as days went past. Snow started to pile in, and that\u2019s when everything went to shit. \n\nI had two heaters; the one I brought and was using, the electric one, and a very old coal-burning heater that was built into the cabin back in the day. My new heater stopped working, I didn\u2019t panic, the old one worked fine so I started using that one.\n\nBut the cold got worse. The old heater\u2019s pipeline, the one responsible for carrying the carbon dioxide outside got blocked by snow. The gases started to go inside the house and I could barely breathe, couldn\u2019t open the windows either because the cold wind would make things worse.\n\nGo outside and risk dying in the cold to fix the heater, or asphyxiate indoors. Simple choice, I put on my coat and opened the door.\n\nA chill ran all over my body, and the numbness that took over my life carried over to nature itself, I felt death breathing down my neck. \n\nMaking my way through the thick snow I realized how difficult this was going to be. It was taken longer than expected and my socks got wet, they started freezing and I could no longer feel my feet. The wind grew stronger, a snowstorm began and the wind blew off my scarf.\n\nI started to cry; the tears froze, so did my sweat.

I didn't look behind me when walking alone. I never asked my friends to come with me when leaving the classroom. The school hired more security guards, One at the end of every hall and bathroom. The school calls it a horrible accident, a tragedy no one saw coming. Parents were horrified, and rightfully so. They were enraged something like this could even happen. I don't think anyone ever imagined something like this *could* happen. I mean, how does a student get stabbed to death in a restroom, and no one hears or sees a thing?\n\nIt happened in D hall. The girls' bathroom. A sophomore named Victoria, she was in the Gardening club. I don't like gardening, all that dirt underneath my fingernails.\n\nShe was stabled 15 times. The most popular rumor was that a teacher was in love with her and killed her after being rejected. Others think a stranger broke into the school and killed her. D hall is littered with flowers now, and the bathroom door has been decorated with caution tape. They say they haven't opened the restroom because the blood stained the tile. The whole hall seems different now. \n\n*Darker.* \n\n*Colder.* \n\n*Longer.*\n\nI don't like going down there. My skin crawls every time I pass by. I started seeing her when I walked down the hall. I'll see her going into the bathroom, and I called out to her, but she never answered. I went in once, ignoring all the caution tape to see if she would be there, but I found stained brown tile and an empty bathroom. They were right about the tile. \n\nAfter a month, the school moved her memorial area and remodeled the bathroom with new shiny *white* tiles.\n\nI go in there when I see her walking down the hall in her yellow dress and white sneakers \u2014turning on her heel, making a sharp right into the bathroom. I've tried running after her, but every time I find nothing. The last time I saw her was a week before spring break. I chased her down the hall again, but it wasn't empty this time. A girl was sitting on the floor. \n\n\"You see her too, right?\"\n\nShe slowly stood up. \"You see her from down the hall, right?\"\n\nShe was walking towards me. I was frozen in place \"you chase after her too?\" I never took my eyes off the knife in her hand. \"I think she's lonely, and she seems to like you\" I couldn't move; I couldn't scream. I wanted to run down the hall and make as much noise as possible, but I just stood there. \n\n\"You don't mind keeping her company, do you..?\"\n\nI walk down the hall sometimes, hoping a student will follow me. It's cold in here and quite dull. Victoria only talks about flowers and gardening.

Your money went further, and you had time to enjoy your surroundings. Time to explore the nooks and crannies of these often ancient buildings. \n\nMost pubs still had the same basic set up from the reign of Victoria. You entered via a snug by the front door, a calm sidebar with a few stools, which allowed a peace away from the main drinking zone. From here you moved to a main room with calming mucky floors, and a proper pool table with yellow and red balls. Bar Billiards. An actual cigarette machine. A beer garden to shiver in during winter with bitter pints of ale. \n\nIf you looked further, some of the older pubs even contained a Porter Carriage. \n\nTradition insisted that a skeleton decorated the door. Sometimes a skull, sometimes a full man in a cloak. But an image of bones was always etched into the wood of this room. \n\nInside the rooms were as wooden as a sauna.  A few simple chairs and wooden tables dotted the room, providing respite for old men. If the Porter Carriage had windows, the curtains were drawn.  You never had to fight for a space, even on a busy Friday or Saturday night.  \n\nNo one made you drink porter in this room, but you often received a glare should you enter with anything different in your glass. Lager was banished on sight. Whisky was just about allowed.\n\nIf the snug dealt in solitude, and the main room in socialising, the Porter Carriage dealt in time. You sipped your drink, and spoke in whispers. After a while, everything stopped. Keeping control your drinking speed was the key. Porter is a malty drink, you can ration out sips for a long time.\n\nOne pint was your limit in the Porter Carriage. That was the whole point. I saw the consequences of boorishness once. A pair of lads shouting at the far table. Complaining about a lack of vodka at the bar. The old men kept their heads down, and I did the same. \n\nNot many of the objects in the room cast shadows. But what gloomy flickers that did exist grew longer, and darker than the pints in our hands.  I had a strange sense that the noise levels were not dimming, but fading to a light grey the colour of old age.  \n\nSoon the table was empty, and a member of staff broke the illusion by opening the door. She cleared the glasses, and wiped away a thick layer of dust that coated the now empty chairs. \n\nThat was pubs in the old days. A pedestrian place of wonder. And I understand why pubs now lack a Porter Carriage. But I cannot say I do not miss them, and the infinite wonder that they brought.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674429417.0,"comments":[{"author":"mildOrWILD65","text":"I liked this very much, thank you!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674450155.0},{"author":null,"text":"I like this a lot, and your username is so sweet.

One was his ever ongoing battle with technology. New TVs, phones or microwaves, he\u2019d be on the verge of smashing them against the wall in a matter of days after the purchase, yelling how he wanted the gadget\u2019s predecessor back. \n\nThe other problem were the things he heard that weren\u2019t there. Sometimes he disappeared into his home office and if you knocked and asked him would he come out for dinner, he\u2019d just say no, sorry, too much work. \n\nOne day he came into my room with a voice recorder he normally used to tape marketing ideas or other things I didn\u2019t care for as a kid. He pressed rewind. When I asked what this was about, he put his finger over his lips. He looked pale and tired. We listened to the end of some talk about lowering profit margin expectations next year. A click marked the point where Dad had pressed the stop button. Another click: Record. Silence. My father\u2018s voice: \u201eAll I want is for you to leave me alone!\u201c Silence again. Dad\u2019s eyes widened. He shook the recorder. \u201eBut it was there!\u201c I didn\u2019t dare say a word but my father finally calmed down and apologized to me. \n\nMy mother left him late in life. A year later, he drowned in the tub, sleepy from his pills and too much red wine. \n\nIt\u2019s been a week since the burial and I\u2019m in the house. There are things I have to take care of now. In Dad\u2019s old office, I skip through the paperwork, the house, the bills, insurances, everything. I open a drawer and there\u2019s the old recorder. \n\nI press \u201ePlay\u201c because I want to hear him. I feel we should have talked more, spent more time together.

Colon Cancer, some fifteen years ago. I\u2019m listening to ghost talk. \n\nI realize Dad\u2019s colleague\u2019s not really whispering. There are three small wheels which you can use to elevate one voice or sound while suppressing the other.

Everyone wants to do something rabbit-related so they can hop into Chinese New Year\u2014literally. \n\nOr at least that is how it is in my family. Last year when it was Tiger Year I was dragged on a trip to live with the tigers in the Borneo Rainforest for the whole 15 days. Or how, in 2020, there were so many rats in our house I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was another new disease.\n\nYep, I live with one strange family. \n\nYesterday I came home to find my whole family laughing over a hotpot dinner. Me? I only had a few carrots on my plate. And some lettuce leaves. That was about it.\n\nI reached out to grab some meat but my dad slapped my hand out of the way.\n\n\u201cVeggies are good for you, bun bun,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cEat up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same for as long as I can remember. Every day my dinner consists of nothing but carrots and lettuce\u2014and occasionally dried rabbit pellets. I also started to eat further and further away from my family, first in a dark corner where I could still see them\u2014and then in a \u2018private dining room\u2019 especially for me. It was more of a cage, really.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure when I started feeling sick. It started with a splitting headache. And then I started feeling hot all over. Like I was being set on fire. I couldn\u2019t stop scratching, because it felt like a thousand needles were prickling my skin.\n\nI started sleeping without my blanket\u2014and when that wasn\u2019t enough\u2014without my clothes. For days on end, I lay in bed, too hot and too tired and too much in pain to do anything else, groaning and thrashing about in a futile attempt to make things better. \n\nThe only things my parents still gave me were carrots and lettuce.\n\nIt was much, much later that my dad came up to check on me. I was still feeling sick, but it felt more *natural* in a way, like the sickness was part of me instead of an imposter. My dad gave a small smile and held up a mirror he had brought with him. I gasped.\n\nI was covered in snowy white fur, and patches of my old human skin were scattered all over my old sheets, shining with blood. My fingers were now glued to my fists that I was clenching in pain and had elongated to form paws, and two of my front teeth had stretched out beyond my lips.\n\nBut most of all there was no mistaking two new floppy ears that had sprouted from the top of my head and that now covered my eyes.\n\n\u201cI know you can do it, my precious bun bun,\u201d my dad said, stroking my back, and sending pleasant shivers up my spine.

Then, not finding anything and preparing to leave, the sallow-faced tattoo artist stopped him. \u201cNo! I\u2019ve got something for you. Just for *you*.\u201d\n\nIt was one of the most intriguing art pieces Daniel had ever seen. Although it consisted of many elements, the piece\u2019s most prominent feature was the grinning, red face of a devil with twisted, golden horns. As the tattooist manipulated the image to simulate the movement of skin, the devil\u2019s grin twisted into a snarl of rage. \n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Daniel exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s it! How much?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s free,\u201d the man replied. \u201cBut there\u2019s a catch: you can NEVER show this to another person, nor look at it yourself. Understand? *NEVER*.\u201d \n\nDaniel should\u2019ve said \u201cno.\u201d He should\u2019ve run. But he didn\u2019t care. He *NEEDED* the art on his skin.\n\nUnlike previous tattoos, the ink felt like molten lead melting into the center of his back. The pain was otherworldly\u2026but Daniel made it through.\n\nStrangely, and within days of getting the new tattoo, the usually-shy Daniel found he\u2019d become incredibly attractive to the opposite sex. Nearly every night found Daniel in bed with a new partner. But afterwards, in the early pre-dawn hours, the right side of his new tattoo would briefly burn like he\u2019d been branded. Still, he never broke the rule; never displayed the tattoo or looked at it, himself.\n\nThen, there was Christy. Golden-haired Christy, whom Daniel had informed his mother was \u201cThe One.\u201d \n\nThey were on a weekend ski trip. Daniel was to propose. \n\nThat night, after a round of mind-blowing sex, he\u2019d forgotten to put his shirt on. As Christy returned to bed, the bathroom\u2019s electric light illuminated his back like a Las Vegas marquee. \u201cWhoa!\u201d she marveled. \u201cYou have a tattoo on your back? It\u2019s amazing!\u201d Then, quietly she added, \u201cBut\u2026who are all those girls?\u201d\n\n*Girls?*\n\n\u201cIs\u2026that one\u2026me?\u201d Christy inquired, coming closer.\n\nShe never made it to the bed. There was a sudden, high-pitched screeching sound and a bright flash of light. Blinded, Daniel didn\u2019t see what happened next. Thankfully, the screeching drowned out Christy\u2019s screams. When his eyes had refocused, Daniel\u2019s beloved was gone.\n\nThe left side of Daniel\u2019s tattoo suddenly burned like molten lava. But this time, he had a sudden, overwhelming urge to *see*.\n\nNow, trembling before the sink, he slowly turned and peered into the mirror. The devil tattoo grinned at him. To its right, were tattoos of the faces of his previous one-night stands. But hanging from its left hand: Christy\u2019s head.\n\n*NEVER look at it*, rasped a voice deep within Daniel\u2019s mind. He felt a searing pain and noticed the tattooed image of his own head appear beside Christy\u2019s.\n\nThe screeching began. Daniel screamed\u2026","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674351305.0,"comments":[{"author":"fusiongal","text":"This was very original, great story OP!","upvotes":40,"created_utc":1674361403.0},{"author":"Aware-Cookie3910","text":"Loved it.","upvotes":9,"created_utc":1674374160.0},{"author":"my-cynical-thoughts","text":"This is really good!

The bus should've been there a while ago. It was pretty late in the evening, 11:30 PM to be exact. The air had a chill to it as a breeze would pass by getting stronger for a few seconds every now and then. It was a pretty unpleasant place to be. Waiting on the side of a road miles away from the city, let alone a gas station. There was nothing but a metal sign covered in different stickers with varying numbers labeling the bus routes. The stickers were yellow with numbers in bold text, almost faded due to age. They seemed like they were on the verge of peeling off. Jeremiah sighed and leaned against the sign as he checked his phone.\n\n\"Two hours late, Fucking great.\", he said closing out the bus route and opening up an internet browser to check the news.\n\nA bus would eventually make its way to the stop. Jeremiah looked up with a slight smile before it soon faded away. It was the 12, not the 16. The bus would stop before starting back up and making its way to the next stop. Jeremiah looked across the street to see a middle-aged man in a suit walk to his side of the road. The man's skin was a pale white with visible age from the creases and the stress due to the bags under his eyes. Jeremiah took a step back in shock for a moment. He never saw the bus door open up or anyone come out.\n\nThe man made his way to the bench near the bus stop and sat down. \"A tad bit chilly tonight.\", he blurted out in a monotone voice without any context. At that moment Jeremiah felt a large wind blow by that was quite a few degrees colder than it was outside. He held himself for a second under the thin jacket he was wearing. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to wear a cheap zip-up hoodie tonight. He didn't exactly plan to work this late though. \"Yes, yes it is.\", he replied saying nothing else. Jeremiah looked at a bush across the street at what he thought was a pair of white glowing eyes. They seemed to belong to a black humanoid creature, almost like a living shadow with no apparent features.\n\n\"A tad bit chilly tonight.\", the man said again in the same monotone voice. The same breeze came by. Jeremiah tapped his foot impatiently. More white glowing dots showed up along with more movement. Jeremiah took a few steps back in fear. Was this even the right stop he got off at? He noticed that there were no tire tracks in the dirt as he felt a sharp chest pain. He fell to the ground gasping for air. \"Bus don't come out here. Everyone gets off. Nobody goes.\", the man said fading away.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674363428.0,"comments":[{"author":"Justhuman963","text":"Unlucky are those who get off at the wrong stop.

There were so many of them here, at their new place. \n\nThe cawing penetrated her brain. Thinking she must be dreaming, the sounds fell into patterns she could recognize- words. \n\nShe opened her eyes. She wasn\u2019t dreaming. Luke, her husband, was breathing heavily next to her. And she could understand what the crows were saying. \n\nShe lay still- catching the words as they filtered through the curtains. Cars- food- dogs- crows- wind- She got up and looked outside the window at the swirling patterns of crows rising and falling against the grey sky. They ignored her. She went back to bed, and tried to cuddle up to Luke, who rolled away. She lay back, tears spilling out of her eyes while listening to the caws.\n\nShe did not tell anyone- it wasn\u2019t anything to brag about, and it was a period of her life where she found herself withdrawing mostly from friends and family- it was the pandemic first, but then it was just too hard, and Luke seemed to need her whenever she had plans and then everybody was so busy and usually cancelled anyway. Even though she was often relieved when plans were cancelled, mostly because that made Luke happy. \n\nWhat an odd power to have!  Almost anything else would have been more useful, she thought bitterly one night, alone after Luke had stormed off after a particularly vicious spat. \n\nHe was becoming increasingly intolerant and intolerable, absent for long periods only explained by a terse word \u201cwork\u201d and when she pressed, prone to furious outbursts. She didn\u2019t know what was going on in his mind, and when went up to him, begging him to explain he took her wrists squeezing hard and pushed away, before leaving. \n\nA friend called soon after, and guessing by Alice\u2019s voice how shaken up she was, blurted out that she didn\u2019t think Luke was treating her right. Alice became angry, told her friend to mind her own business, that Luke was a good man who would never hurt her. Then she hung up the phone and went to bed. It was already dark, and the crows were silent. \n\nShe finally fell asleep, only to be jerked awake by a particularly screechy cawing which seemed to come from inside her head. The curtains were lit with dawn light, the shape of a large crow silhouetted black behind it. \n\nThere was no sign of Luke. \n\n\u201cRun away! Now- he wants to kill you!\u201d said the crow. \n\nShe went to the window and pulled back the curtain. The crow opened its beak \u201cRun, now! He\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\nShe looked behind him- the grey sky turning black with crows. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at the driveway- Leave through the back door- We will distract him\u201d And the crow flew off. \n\nAlice pulled on her robe, grabbed her phone and sneakers, slipped out of the back door and began running.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674334060.0,"comments":[{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Corvids are amazingly knowledgeable, as Alice should appreciate.","upvotes":46,"created_utc":1674344272.0},{"author":"J_Leigh13","text":"See and all my murder does is caw at me for peanuts every morning, freeloaders.","upvotes":28,"created_utc":1674351234.0},{"author":"GoddessRosez","text":"I want to have a murder of crows","upvotes":25,"created_utc":1674351657.0},{"author":"S4njay","text":"Literally everyone but her spotted the red flags!","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1674363766.0},{"author":"ailweni","text":"Good crows!","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1674349517.0},{"author":"BlacksmithCrafty1863","text":"I want to read more!","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1674367562.0},{"author":"Address_Glad","text":"I\u2019d believe the crows!

I caressed the metal and for the first time in months, I felt warmth.\n\nI finally pulled out the coins and counted. Ten, twenty, fifty cents. Not even a dollar. Not even enough to buy a full meal.

The ass hole cold weather becomes terrified of me and stops making me cold because it's scared of beaten by me again. When I feel the cold air making me cold again, I just go back to besting it up, by waving my arms and legs. I use my whole body to beat up the cold, and the cold becomes scared and goes away. When I feel that I have beaten up the cold and that it wouldn't return, it returns. \n\nIt's like the cold loves a beating and all I can do is beat it up. I have been chasing the cold and stalking it, and then the cold goes away and I feel warmer. The cold is an ass hole and with cold weather all you could do is best it up. There is no point in trying to be polite and asking the cold weather to go away, you have got to become violent with the cold weather. Throw those punches at the cold weather, throw those kicks and knees at the cold weather. Then the cold weather will feel a little humiliated and will go away, but when it comes back because it's an ass hole, just beat it up again. \n\nI have recently met a person who has a cold personality. The person seems to have no emotion and is always distant. So I started to become threatening to this person and trying to scare him. Like the cold weather this person has the cold distant personality to make others feel empty. Like the cold weather I knew I had to become violent with this person. This person is like the personification of the cold weather. So I started to beat him up and he started calling for help. \n\nI beat him up pretty bad and he is in hospital, but I still feel emotionally cold. Unlike the cold weather, when I beat up the cold weather, I actually feel warm after. It's totally different when I beat up an emotionally cold distant person. I was taken into the police station and I told them everything of how I beat up cold weather, and how that didn't correlate well with besting up an emotionally cold person. The officers listening to me had an answer as to why I felt warm, after beating up the cold weather. \n\nI was intrigued and they told that the reason I felt warm after beating up the cold weather, is because I physically moving around like exercise, which is why I felt warm.

At first I look around, and I'm alone. But this cry, a baby's cry, seems to have come from the cornfield. It sounds like it needs help. Should I? I have no phone with me. \n\nThe baby's cry never stops. I finally make my choice. \n\n&&&\n\nEndless rows of yellowed cornstalks tower over me while my shoes crunch the decaying layers of it on the ground. I scan around, listening for the baby's cry. It grows louder and I quicken my pace toward that direction. \n\nTen steps. Seventeen steps. Forty steps. Then--\n\nI stop and see a small pile of cornstalks and husks. From within that pile must be the baby because its wail is strongest here, and I start to dig. My hands endure small cuts from the cornstalks and husks, but I don't care. As long as the baby's safe...\n\nOnce I clear out the pile, I see a baby's bundle, trembling slightly, crying loudly.\n\nA cold wind bites my face.\n\n\"It's going to be fine,\" I say gently to the baby. \"There, there.\"\n\nThe baby coos as I cradle it in my arms. Poor sweet thing. Out here all alone. Abandoned. The face is already covered, as it's Fall weather. I rise slowly and look around. \n\nHave you ever been to the annual corn maze event they do in town? I see endless cornstalks all around. A spell to confuse unsuspected strangers.\n\nSome time passes and the baby begins to cry. \n\n\"Hush baby, hush.\" Rocking my arms, I smile. \"You're safe now.\" \n\nA few seconds later--\n\n*Snap*! \n\nI look to my left. \n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nAnother snap.\n\nI grip the baby firmly. I call out again and more snaps come. It takes me seconds to realize that *something* or *someone* is coming toward us.

I just run.\n\nEleven steps, twenty steps.\n\nThe baby's cry deafens me. It echoes throughout the cornfield. My heart pounds, my face bitten by the autumn cold.\n\nI don't know how far I made it with my feet, but I catch my breath and glance at the baby. The cornfield seems endless. Without even a few seconds, the snaps return louder, this time, from the sides.\n\n*Snap--snap--snap*...\n\nA few more steps and I see someone. Finally. I wave at the man for help.\n\nHe turns and I almost drop the baby. His face is bloodied, saggy and has button eyes. His bloodied hair and body seem to be made of straw. He approaches us. \n\nI finally trip and the baby wails. I scream as I see walking cornstalks with humanoid faces surround us. I huddle with the baby for dear life, only to realize it has a pale yellow humanoid face with black eyes, with a single green sprout for hair.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674314066.0,"comments":[{"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","text":"Creepy","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1674314418.0},{"author":"Economy_Candidate299","text":"Author's note:\n\nPLEASE ASK FOR MY PERMISSION TO USE MY STORIES FOR NARRATIONS.

It was a strange feeling. No man ever set foot on the red planet; except me, Howard, Clark, and Edgar. We spent days on the planet collecting rocks and everything, trying to search for water or some kind of unicellular life.\n\nOne day, our rover found some strange thing. We couldn't believe what it was, we even went there to investigate in person. However, we could already see what it was before we reached the object. We were all horrified. We couldn\u2019t even speak for about a minute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the flag of the USSR!\u201d Edgar broke the silence. \u201cThis must be some kind of joke. We are the first humans on this planet. That\u2019s impossible!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to inform the Earth about this.\u201d\n\nA few days later, we got orders from Earth. We had to investigate the site further. This time we used metal detectors, and immediately found something buried under the ground. We used our rover to dig down, and quickly found a cave.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Edgar pointed at the dark tunnel. \u201cThat looks like a skeleton!\u201d\n\nHe was right. It was a skeleton in an astronaut suit, with a big red star on the helmet. I also found a little notebook near the body. It was a really short diary of an astronaut called Mikhail, who documented his journey on Mars.\n\n\u201cDay 9, 1978, Tomorrow we'll investigate the mountains because someone is watching us from there.\u201d I read the last page to the others.  \"That\u2019s the last sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething must\u2019ve been horrible if they decided they would never come back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear that?\u201d Howard asked. We all listened. \n\n\u201cIs that water?\u201d I raised my eyebrows.\n\nWe started following the sound. Luckily, we had a few flashlights with us. Not too long after we found the first skeleton, we found another one, but it was strange. It wasn\u2019t a human skeleton. It looked human, but it was taller, and its skull was way longer than a human skull. There weren\u2019t any breathing devices near the body, it wasn\u2019t an astronaut. This discovery was even more disturbing than the soviet flag and astronaut.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a chance that there was life on this planet before?\u201d asked Howard.\n\nThen it happened. We heard someone walking. It wasn\u2019t us. We saw it. This creature was there, probably from the same species as the skeleton. It was tall, around two meters and a half, with red skin. He raised his spear and threw it at us.\n\nThe spear hit poor Edgar in the head. He immediately fell, without a sound. Howard and Clark ran away, and I followed him. We ran straight back to our base.\n\nThe soviets did the right thing when they left the planet. We should do the same. There are things here that we just can\u2019t understand. Things we thought were impossible. And since that day, we see someone watching us from the mountain every night.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674312123.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"I like the sci-if horror stuff!

A creature hunkers in the subzero haze. It has a body like a giant sloth and the head of a man. And all the killing power and more of a short-faced bear. Frozen blood is matted in its fur. Its man head is recessed in the fur like a hunched back. It glowers out of a somewhat ridged brow and flat face, visage between homo heidelbergensis and sapien. It glowers at a mound of bones in the rift that stretches for miles like a mass grave. It makes language noises. It massages a crude idol of dried intestines in its claws. An invisible fire is started, taught behavior, time-bound. It was taught by prehistoric shamans, who themselves were instructed by cosmic radiation. The cosmic radiation came from a sick star\u2019s supernova. Sick because infected with a massive parasite resembling looped intestines, or an ouroboros. Head biting tail. The radiation carries the sickness to places like Earth and places like Earth return it, changed, through spacetime. The creature knows little of this, but a lot more is writ in its freakishly large and durable muscle and bone, taught to them like the time-bound knowledge passed down from ancestors, more than just hard-wired instinct. The last act of metamorphosis has started. This is how the creature can be frozen without dying. It slithers and sinks into the bones, rubbing the wormy idol all the while. A chrysalis of ice surrounds the concoction. Ages pass. Ice melts and the cocoon sinks and sinks until modern humankind is here, in Spokane where this stretch of the ice sheet once was.

I could ride a bike with the children down the street and laugh and cry and no one suspected there was anything *different* about me. Granted, I never had many friends and even the ones I did have, they weren't exactly close. The other kids might not have known why they didn't want to get too close to me, but they could probably sense there was something wrong. \n\nThe worst was adolescence. Puberty hit me like a fucking train and every little piece of me that didn't fit the puzzle only grew more and more abstract. That's when people started to notice. I stared too long, smiled too broadly, spoke too unnaturally. All the fake social bullshit I thought I had nailed as a child, didn't quite cut it anymore.\n\nThen came adulthood and with adulthood comes jobs, families and the worst of it all; small talk. Getting the odd crappy night job was never difficult, I could even fumble through a few online relationships once in a while but small talk\u2026.what a minefield! It takes a hell of a lot of concentration to fight through a benign conversation with a person without tipping them off. You have to seem interested but not too interested. You have to be interesting but you can't hog all the attention. A small modest laugh here, a sympathetic frown there. God, the motor skills required to display such finite emotions! Seconds trapped in an obligatory interaction like small talk felt like hours. My skin starts to feel too small, too tight and I just want to scream. \n\nI need more space. Room to think for myself. You don't understand how hard it is walking through life so *stuck.* I've thought about moving and it always just seemed like so much effort.

More detail, I wanted to know the pain of giving birth and it was merely to understand. I then met a woman called Cheryl and I told her that i wanted to know what giving birth felt like. Cheryl took it upon herself to give me the full painful experience of giving birth. I was excited and a little scared but definitely up for it, and Cheryl liked my enthusiasm and she had so many things planned for me, to give me the full experience of what giving birth feels like. \n\nFirst she a me getting punched in the stomach by ten guys. It was really painful and the ten guys really knew how to throw a punch. I was in so much pain and I was definitely sure that this is what giving birth felt like. Then Cheryl looked me dead in the eye and told me, that's no where near the full pain of giving birth. Then she told me to get punched in the stomach, another ten times. I was in even more pain, but Cheryl looked me in the eye and said \"that is no where near the full pain of birth\" \n\nThen Cheryl had me go in for an operation in the gut, by her private surgeon. They were just going to make incision in my gut and then sow me back up. I had to take the operation without being put under, it was so painful, and at the same time I had Cheryl telling me that what I was experiencing was no where near the pain of birth. I couldn't believe how painful giving birth can be and I didn't want to endure any more, but another side to me told me to keep going. I had to figure out the full pain of giving birth. \n\nThen after the operation, Cheryl had me moving around even though I should have been laying down in bed, healing from my operation. I was in so much pain and Cheryl kept shouting at me by saying \"this is no where near the full pain of giving birth\" and I was starting to lose hope.

We booked a private, after hours tour at a small art gallery downtown. After dinner at a restaurant nearby, we walked over to the gallery where the owner met us at the door. \n\nShe led us through the showroom, stopping at each exhibit to explain its significance. We reached the far end of the gallery and stood in front of an oil painting of an ornate vase filled with vibrant flowers. Our guide paused, studying our faces before she spoke. \n\n\u201cThis piece has an interesting history,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe artist meant it as a gift for his lover and planned to finish it in time for her birthday. Tragically, she passed away before then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe took his life a few months later, but not before finishing the painting. Since then, it has changed owners many times and acquired a sinister reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is widely believed that the painting is cursed. Rumor has it that some see a vase of wilting flowers when they view the painting. And like the artist\u2019s lover, they do not live to see their next birthday.\u201d\n\nMy wife was very quiet on the ride home. Jokingly, I asked her what she saw in the painting. With tears in her eyes, she said, \u201cmost of the flowers were dead and only a few wilted ones remained in the vase.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674318816.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"For the Record","author":"k_g_lewis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10hav1f\/for_the_record\/","text":"Courtney walked into the room cradling a cardboard box in her arms.\n\n\u201cLook what I found up in the attic,\u201d she said, sliding the box onto the dining room table.\n\nShe reached inside the box and pulled out an old vintage rock and roll album that was in near pristine condition.\n\n\u201cDad\u2019s record collection,\u201d her sister, Jennifer, gasped, \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about those.\u201d\n\nCourtney and Jennifer\u2019s father had recently passed away. They were going through his belongings, trying to decide what they wanted to keep and what they wanted to sell.\n\nThe records were a big deal in their family because nobody but their father was allowed to play them. He used to lock himself in his room whenever he would listen to them. Which was something he would do at least once a week.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the record player?\u201d Jennifer asked, \u201cWe have to play one just to spite him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I saw it in the spare bedroom,\u201d Courtney said, \u201cI\u2019ll go get it.\u201d \n\nShe slid the album she was holding back into the box before walking to the back of the house.

I surreptitiously tried to pull it out before the others noticed and berated me for slowing them down. This was my first \u2018man to man\u2019 time with my fiance's father and brother, and it was glaringly apparent they weren\u2019t ready to embrace me into the family. We couldn\u2019t be more opposite, I was a left-leaning, city dwelling, husky (fine, chubby), software engineer. They were as rural as they come, and leaned so far right they were practically horizontal. Not my regular people, but I was desperate to make it work, for my fiance, Daisy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust thinking of her gave me the strength to rip my boot out of the mud with a sickening *squelch*. If you\u2019d told me I would end up with a girl like that when I was 16\u2026 well, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. She was drop dead gorgeous, and she looked at me with these big brown eyes that made me feel like I could do anything. She laughed at all my corny jokes, with her I felt like a new man. I knew it was early, but by four months I popped the question, and made her joint on everything. I knew that growing up she didn\u2019t have much. Financially, I was very set. I wanted her to feel secure with me, and (if I\u2019m being honest) because of me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe brought me back home for Thanksgiving, that\u2019s when her father, Dustin, declared that I would join him hunting. I hated guns, but Daisy had prepared me for this. Hunting was important to them, and they were important to Daisy. It sounded like her last boyfriend had been a bad sport about it. I agreed to go immediately, under the table I felt her squeeze my hand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s camp!\u201d announced Dustin Jr, dropping his pack in a clearing. I sank gratefully to the ground and chugged my water. Yes, camp. I\u2019d found out that morning that, to this family, hunting wasn\u2019t a one-day thing. You had to drive, then hike really far.

We didn't get to spend as much time together since life had taken us our separate ways, which is the reason we began our yearly trip out here to the middle of nowhere. A couple weeks of backcountry skiing and snowshoeing gave us just enough time to catch up with one another. Derek and Amy were now married, me and Bailey were engaged, and Dan was... Well, Dan was Dan. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt had been his idea to explore the ice caves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"So, was it worth it?\" he asked, turning to me with a smirk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ask me again when we're a couple miles closer,\" I replied, teeth chattering. Truthfully, I was glad he'd convinced us to take the hike, the caves had been remarkable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Don't worry, I'll warm you up when we get back,\" Bailey winked. Behind us, Derek had an arm wrapped around Amy, they giggled and spoke in hushed voices to one another. In that moment I really felt for Dan. It never seemed to bother him, at least not outwardly, but he had always been the odd one out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor some reason this thought made me stop dead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we had been leaving the ice caves, something made me look back. A strange sensation, almost like we were being watched. I had been relieved to find only the tracks our snowshoes had made behind us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there had been *four* sets of tracks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow were there five of us? There had never been five. It had always been four, just four of us who made this yearly trip. I was certain, I could feel it. Something had wormed it's way into my memory, something that did not belong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You okay?\" Dan, the odd one out, asked with concern. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were best friends. We grew up together, we went to the same college... Didn't we? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You know, I might take a minute to rest. You keep going, Dan, we'll catch up,\" I tried to speak evenly, squeezing Bailey's hand as hard as I could. She glanced up at me with a frown as I tried to silently signal to Derek and Amy the danger we were in.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"No, no, I'll wait,\" Dan said, \"Safety first. We should all stick together.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy heart thudded against my ribs, unsure of what to do. My vision swam, my breath caught, and before I knew it, I was falling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI blinked up at my four friends, all kneeling around me in the snow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don't know what came over me...\" I muttered, trying to shake the fog from my mind. I remembered being worried about something, but what, I couldn't recall. Dan mentioned something about altitude sickness or overexertion, and we waited a while until I was up for walking again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Don't you worry,\" **Samantha** winked, taking my hand- \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'll take *good* care of you.\"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674262318.0,"comments":[{"author":"psyopticnerve","text":"Wendigo, skinwalker, goatman, mimic?

I promised myself on the day of his birth would be the last time either of us would ever see him. That fateful day in the hospital he had clenched a fistful of my hair while calling me every name in the book. I was able to make a run for it with Noah and never looked back. I can still hear the hospital\u2019s piercing alarms as I frantically gathered my son and whatever belongings I had on me when I arrived. \n\nThe first few weeks were the toughest. Noah constantly cried, nothing consoled him. What made it even harder was being a new mother and not having any close family or friends to help raise him, this only cemented my mindset that Noah and I were alone in this world.\n\nEverything scared me, public places, parks, strangers and even the local news.\n\nMurder, sexual assault and kidnappings ravaged my screen. I held my son close to my chest whenever a mother was crying about her child that had met an untimely demise. \n\nAs my son grew so did my anxieties. On his first day of kindergarten, I found myself in a screaming match with his teacher because she had failed to inform me that a strange man had come asking questions about Noah. \n\nI took him out of public school that very same day and started home schooling. \n\nToday was his 8th birthday, we ordered pizza and watched movies. I had just finished putting his candles on his birthday cake when I heard a broadcasting announcement. I walked out from the kitchen to the living room. \n\nThey were doing a report on missing children.

Some strange woman with tear filled eyes held this photo with shaking hands, Noah\u2019s birth father next to her side. She was spinning a fantastic tale of a woman with a crazed look in her eye and a hunger for a child of her own. \n\nI turned off the tv and smiled sweetly at Noah, telling him to go wash up for dessert. \n\nWith heavy feet I made my way to the kitchen, opening the cupboard that contained the cleaning supplies and pest control. \n\nSprinkling a heavy amount of rat poison onto the spider man cake, I let out a heavy sigh. \n\nNo one will ever take my baby from me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674245891.0,"comments":[{"author":"PnutButterJellyTim3","text":"I could kinda see it coming from the beginning, but it was still exciting to read.

She had picked up the iron from the closet and ran down after him, where he lay winded and struggling to get up. Before he could, she smashed his head in. Then she ran back, carefully wiped the iron clean and put it back. \n\nShe didn't remember much what happened afterwards, just feeling good that no one was trying to kill her to make their business succeed.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674240066.0,"comments":[{"author":"tessa1950","text":"Jennie is a true survivor, definitely \u201cborn-to-strength\u201d like her namesake.

He'd been with us for a long time, almost since the beginning of the shop! If I recall, he came from a faraway land and stayed here for good.\n\nNext, to oversee the rest of my little empire, I went to the first floor. This was the only floor customers could actually shop in, and it was packed to the seams. After all, our store offers everything at the lowest prices in town, and 24\/7 at that! Our competitors never believe it, they always allege foul play, but they can go pound sand.\n\nThe cashier, a young woman named Felicia, immediately approached me. Growing closer, she asked, \"Good morning sir! Do you want your massage as requested now?\"\n\nShe was another one I liked. She'd been working here since her teenage years, and was devoted to me and her job like nothing else. \n\nI smiled. \"No, later. Go man the cashier, the customers are waiting!\"\n\nAs she walked off, I went into the built-in closet in a back room. Unknown to anyone else, it leads to a basement as well! I walked down the stone stairs to the corridor, before pushing open a heavy metal door. Inside, two muscular men of mine were holding down a struggling young man.\n\n\"Good morning sir,\" one of them rumbled, \"This is the type of guy you wanted. Young and fit as a fiddle.\"\n\n\"Alright, do it.\" I commanded.\n\nAs he flailed desperately, they injected the long syringe filled with green liquid into his neck until he stopped resisting. I smiled, for soon he would become a good little employee like the others, compliant to every instruction given.\n\nI love my employees.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674227488.0,"comments":[{"author":"S4njay","text":"Randomly thought of the idea, so I wrote it on the fly!","upvotes":27,"created_utc":1674227563.0},{"author":"Own_Magazine_7410","text":"Very surprising \ud83d\ude2e I wasn't ready!!","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1674230667.0},{"author":"S4njay","text":"If you liked the story, check out r\/NightbringerWrites!","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1674231211.0}]},{"title":"A vampire walks into a bar","author":"Repulsive_Curve_8828","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10hba5z\/a_vampire_walks_into_a_bar\/","text":"\u201cSo, how would you like me to buy you another drink, gorgeous?\u201d \n\nUgh. *Qu\u00e9 iron\u00eda!* It makes me cringe *so* hard to see Victor in action during his nightly \u2018bitch-hunts'. Every night, he\u2019d place himself in some bar and try to woo the hottest chick around with his silver tongue and smooth lies. Wear fancy suits. Drive glamorous cars. Order pricy drinks.  \n\nWhy? To win over a girl for the night? One, whom he can suck the blood dry off, just to stay young and beautiful for another day?  \n\nFor hell\u2019s sake, he\u2019s over three millennia old! Vampires his age have long since retired. But not victor, no. Still going around chasing meaningless, short-term pleasures. Living a lush life, getting girls to tell him how handsome he is. Sucker for social validation.  \n\nI honestly feel bad for the girl when she smiles. Victor has won her over- always does- but what right does that give him to ruin her life? She leaves the bar hobbling, Victor supporting her on one side as he flashes me a smug smile.  \n\nGod, how much do I hate this guy? \n\nWell, if nothing else, at least he makes me feel even better about my own life decisions. That\u2019s why I watch him every night: to remind myself how much better I am. A simple, abstinent life. I have no vices. I don\u2019t need to harm anyone, or need anybody\u2019s opinions to feel good about myself. No, I live a simple life, one without luxuries. Just bare necessities.  \n\nA good night\u2019s sleep, every night. That\u2019s all I want. That\u2019s what I get.  \n\nThen why do I feel like shit in the morning? \n\nIs it because of that familiar, squishy, meaty taste of regret in my mouth? Is it the inexplicable bloodstains on my clothes?  \n\nOr, is it because of that stranger girl leaving my room?  She wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eye. She walks away groaning, limping, leaving a dripping, bloody trail behind from where I bit- no- *ate* her brains.  \n\nI would cry if I could, apologize to the girl for infecting her with the same virus that plagues me. But I can\u2019t. Even if I could, she wouldn\u2019t understand. Neither would I. With the virus in our systems, our brains aren\u2019t capable of comprehending anything anymore, other than our hunger for brains.  \n\nBut, occasionally, I *can* comprehend. And I comprehend that Victor has a goal in life. I do not. He works to achieve that goal. To stay handsome, for survival. He invests in himself and his life to attract others. There is a class about him, a certain sophistication to his blood-sucking ways. \n\nAnd then, there are zombies like me. We couldn\u2019t care about how we look, or about our repulsive personalities. No drive, no zeal in our undead lives. But, there *is* hunger. A hunger that makes us do horrible, gruesome things \n\nThat\u2019s when I realize. It\u2019s not contempt that we zombies harbor towards the vampires, no.  \n\nWe harbor jealousy.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674254798.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The \u201cPsycho Drug\u201d","author":"isleepwithsqurirells","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10hbcmp\/the_psycho_drug\/","text":"No one knows what to call it really. The \u201cFlorida Man\u201d drug, the \u201cSugar Rush\u201d drug, everyone had a nickname for it. You could walk outside your house and see it all over the news. Or, among those who had unwillingly taken it. Arson rates increased by 80%, as well as most of the other murderous crimes. \n\nNew York had an average of 20 fires in a 10 mile radius at all times. London had 2 murders happening every 5 minutes. Banks were sucked clean, jewellery stores were simply empty, the works. Emergency Services sort of gave up. Local communities established Mini-Helpers, but they didn\u2019t help much.\n\nHow did this all start? Well, it began in Paris. On the 14th of January, a male by the name of Jack Holmes started rampaging. He went totally psycho. Murdered 28 people in the vicinity in 10 minutes. Others began to join. Screams of sheer terror began to flood the air. Before anyone knew it, over 100 Parisians were causing chaos. Only 19 were apprehended by police. The others ran free.\n\nSomehow, these events spread to other continents. Scientists believed it was spread from person to person by touch, and had an undetermined time of which symptoms appear. The world became a crime haven. 20th of January, no one knew who to trust or what to do. Then some San Francisco scientists got a message.\n\nThe person went by A.L.E.X. People think the X was thrown in to make it a normal name. The message read \u201cI am the creator of all of this. I started the Psycho drug. I predict half the world will be controlled by it in 1 year.\u201d\n\nObviously, the scientists asked how to stop it, how it started, what to do. A.L.E.X. simply stated \u201cIt began as a small bottle, sprayed on 100 people, give or take. It makes the patient have feral instincts, no morals, no compassion. You get 3 days before it goes into effect, and it is spread by touch. It does have an expiration date, 5 years from now. Provided humanity survives, the effects will disappear. I don\u2019t think any of you reading this will live to see it.\u201d\n\nThat was the last anyone heard from A.L.E.X.  We all think he is correct. The rich have fled to bunkers, the poor starve on the streets and everyone everywhere has reached the same conclusion. Our world is fucked. \n\nThis is why I am writing my diary, so I can document humanity crumbling. I love my creation.\n\nA.L.E.X.

I fell through the top floor and main floor and crashed into the cement in the basement.\n\nI didn\u2019t phase again until I was sixteen. I got a feeling, like when you\u2019re going to sneeze. I put my hand on the wall in my room, started walking and passed right into the bathroom. I couldn\u2019t believe it! I was laughing, but something felt wrong. I looked in the mirror and I was missing one of my front teeth.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a super power, it was a curse. Every time I\u2019d phase through a wall, my body would leave a piece of me in the wall. I decided then and there it was too dangerous. I would never phase again. And I didn\u2019t. Until I was eighteen.\n\nI heard my dad\u2019s desperate calls on the phone. If he couldn\u2019t come up with ten thousand dollars we would lose the house.\n\nIn the alley behind the bank, I adjusted the itchy ski mask and told myself this was worth the risk. If I phased through this wall I\u2019d be in a locked vault. I held my breath and walked through. I was fine on the inside and grabbed cash to load in my duffle bag. As I started, I noticed I was missing my left ring finger.\n\nOnce full, I phased back outside. Everything looked different, disorienting. That\u2019s when I realized I had lost my right eye.\n\nA finger and an eye. A small price to pay to keep our house.\n\nBack home my father cried about the money, and my eye. He made me promise I\u2019d never do something like that again. He didn\u2019t want me to lose any more pieces of myself.\n\nThen, there was a violent pounding on the front door.\n\nIt was two police officers. Their guns were drawn. They powered their way in, and handcuffed my dad to a chair.\n\n\u201cWe know what you did at the bank. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not going to arrest you. You\u2019re going to use that devil magic and rob a few banks for us. And if you do that, we\u2019ll let your dad live.\u201d\n\nI had seen enough movies to know what would happen. If I robbed those banks these dirty cops would still kill me.\n\nThere was only one thing to do.\n\nI ran at the first officer. He pointed his gun at me, but I phased right through him. The missing piece of me was inside the cop. He collapsed immediately. \n\nThe second officer tried to shoot me, but I phased through the bullets as I ran at him. An ear, my nose. With each bullet a piece was lost. I jumped through the cop. He collapsed, but so did I.\n\nI realized the piece I lost was my heart.\n\nThe last thing I heard was my father screaming, desperately trying to get out of the handcuffs.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674230133.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Would you like to come to church with us this Sunday?","author":"KeithAtherWrites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10h2qs0\/would_you_like_to_come_to_church_with_us_this\/","text":"It had been a particularly long and frustrating day at work, and I was in a terrible mood. I\u2019ve always tried to leave work problems at work, and vice versa, but sometimes the stupidity and ignorance you experience haunt you. I was in no mood to be around others, so I snapped when I heard, \u201cwould you like to come to church with us on Sunday?\u201d on my walk to the train station.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think I believe in your God, or any God? I could be an Atheist, for all you know. And what makes you so sure there is a God?

I\u2019ll come.\u201d It was the least I could do. Jacob1 gave me a pamphlet with the church\u2019s address, and I continued on my way home. I went to bed as soon as I got there.\n\nSaturday was chill, but I wound up drinking way too much that night, and I didn\u2019t wake up until noon the next morning. My head was killing me, and I stumbled to the bathroom to take some Tylenol. \u201cA nice hot shower should do the trick,\u201d I exclaimed. I turned the shower on and stepped inside.\n\nMy whole body instantly relaxed as the hot water and steam comforted me. The tension melted away, and I felt like I could have spent the entire day there.\n\nI was just about to climax when I heard a loud noise. I slowly opened the shower curtain and peered out. I didn\u2019t see anything or anyone, but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to yell, \u201chello!\u201d I didn\u2019t want whatever it was to know I was aware of their presence.

He fell, and his head connected with my coffee table. His body twitched as something leaked out. He blinked rapidly, and he started to stutter. \u201cW-w-wou-y-u-u-ch-ch-church.\u201d\n\nI was horrified and didn\u2019t know what to do.

I discovered this Reddit thing, though, and *voila*! I had a ready-made platform to get my stuff before people.\n\nSo, over the last week or thereabouts, I\u2019ve posted four stories. The thing I like about these stories most is that they\u2019re themed\u2014not the stories themselves, but they\u2019re all tied together by their titles. I named each of them after a William Hurt movie, and then just wrote a story that sort of matched the title: *Children of a Lesser God* (1986), *The Big Chill* (1983), *Body Heat* (1981), and *Kiss of the Spider Woman* (1985). Even this story, *Mr. Brooks* (2007), is a Hurt film. Guess it\u2019s obvious enough that I\u2019m a William Hurt fan.\n\nOf course, none of the stories have gotten much attention, but that\u2019s okay. At least I\u2019m in the game. Onward and upward from here, right? Besides, they\u2019re all sort of puff pieces\u2014except for *Children of a Lesser God*. It\u2019s got weight behind it.\n\nYou know, as I read over what I just wrote, it occurs to me that I might not\u2019ve been totally honest about the stories. I might\u2019ve gotten a little help writing them\u2014okay, god damnit, I didn\u2019t write them. I nicked them off of this guy named Angus in my creative writing class. But I *could\u2019ve* written them, because after I read them, I was like *yeah, I could\u2019ve written that*. What\u2018s the big deal, right? Angus wasn\u2019t doing anything with them. At least now they\u2019re out there for people to see.\n\nBesides, I\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry. I\u2019ve been working on a novel these last months, and it\u2019s titled similarly to this little story. I call it *The Amorous Adventures of Mr. Brooks*, and it\u2019s a real page-turner. It\u2019s about this good-looking guy who gets women to go home with him, and then he kills them . . . very slowly. *Jeez!* I get wet just thinking about it. Anyway, most of my time here recently has been spent on that, doing research and whatnot . . . writing\u2014and writing can be an arduous, time-consuming process. That much has become clear.\n\nOkay, god damnit. Upon reading that last paragraph, it occurs to me that I might not\u2019ve been totally honest about the novel thing. Turns out I just don\u2019t have the brain for creating stories from whole cloth. I do much better when I write about real life. So, maybe *The Amorous Adventures of Mr. Brooks* is little less fictional and a little more autobiographical (big shrug). So what? Nobody has to know.\n\nAnyway, I should probably get back to it. Angus is still here\u2014been here all week. I have a feeling he won\u2019t be here much longer, though.

Scrawny, freckled, redheaded, unkempt, bespectacled, and a clocksucker. Some of these things ensured he was on the radar of every bully in town, while others made you want to stay away from him.\n\nI was neither a bully, nor a stayer-awayer. I was his friend. I\u2019d never admit this of course. I was what you\u2019d call a *secret compadre*. Acquaintance in the streets, friend in the discretes. \n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what drew me to him, but he reminded me of an undeveloped and malnourished kitten; begging for someone, *anyone*, to give him attention.\n\nAt first I figured that\u2019s why he sucked clocks; attention. It started in second grade; Klaus ran up and grabbed the clock hanging behind the teacher\u2019s desk, and started sucking on it weirdly. Slobbering, drooling; blood smearing the clock as his tongue was ripped open by the secondhand.\n\nWhen Ms. Clara, our teacher, pried him loose from it, Klaus had the freakiest expression on his face, like he was being denied access to Heaven on a technicality or something. \n\n\u201cGive. It. Back.\u201d Klaus snarled, blood-drooly mucus dripping down his multi-freckled visage.\n\nBut Ms. Clara didn\u2019t. Instead she shipped him off to the headmaster. That didn\u2019t stop Klaus though; the next day he was at it again. And the next. Everyday, until they removed the clock entirely.\n\nIn the discreet, I asked him about it. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the clocksucking, Klaus? Do you really need new reasons for people to bully you?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cI want to turn back time,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandfather told me how to do it before he died.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a load of horse bollocks if I ever heard it,\u201d I responded. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. Back in the war he turned back time, and then he killed the charlie that took his eye *before* he could do it.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t argue with that. If anyone needed a temporal return trip, it was Klaus. I\u2019d seen the scars and bruises and cigarette burns; his parents weren\u2019t nice people.\n\nSo Klaus kept sucking clocks.

I had no idea what it took to become a police officer and I have always wanted to become one. The police force in my area were looking for recruits and I applied online and I got through. I couldn't believe it and I was over the moon, I then had to follow a police officer on my first day of training. The police officer showed me around the area and then he started randomly staring at a guy, like he sensed something. He then told me something in dscreet, he told me that the guy he was staring at, is a rapist and has abducted a woman. How he knew that, I have no idea. He arrested him and in the guys flat, this man was holding a woman hostage and had done horrific things to her. \n\nI couldn't believe it and then as the course was progressing, I was taken into a dark room and there was that guy there again.

The police officers had to be evil themselves, and so psychopaths know what other psychopaths are thinking and what they are doing. I then had to rob someone and burgle their house so I had the ability to know and sense thieves and burglars. I was then given a prisoner to beat up so I could sense violent peoples and it all worked. When I was out on the beat I could sense violent people, burglars and murderers, as we now spoke the same language. It started to worry me a little as I started to see the human race a little differently. \n\nNow the guy I had killed, we put him in the police trunk and the officer who was showing me around, he took me to some guys house and we gave him the dead body as a present. He didn't want it and he sounded like he mental disabilities but the officer with me had told the guy with a stern voice \"ww are giving you a present, it's rude not to take presents\" and the guy accepted it. \n\nI knew he didn't want it and I was told he was going to be charged for murder.

I started picking up sticks to take home but then Dad came and yelled at me. He was being mean and I ran out into the woods when they started arguing. I ran for what seemed like a long time. At least until my feet started hurting. I found a nice dry tree stump and sat down to take off my shoes and relax my feet. I must have relaxed for too long because I fell asleep and woke up later in the day.\n\nThe woods were scary at this time. Before you could see the ways between the trees but as the sun went down the dark started to take over. I started to cry because I didn't want to be left out here when the sun finally went out.\n\nI called out into the woods one last time and from right behind heard a step. I turned around and fell to the floor in fright from what was there. It was a man, but he almost looked to be a teenager. He had long shaggy hair and wore nice hiking boots. He took a knee and spoke to me softly.\n\n\"I heard you calling. Are you lost little fella?\" I nodded yes quickly and he smiled.\n\n\"These woods aren't safe for youngsters like you, especially after dark,\" he looked around and stood up while reaching out for me to grab his hand. \"Let's get you back to your parents. They've been worried sick about you\". I grabbed his hand and we walked for a long time. I couldn't see anything at all but he seemed to know exactly where to go. He walked quickly without hitting any rocks or roots. Softly too, I could only hear my own footsteps.\n\n\"Don't fret little one. Your parents are close by. Go on ahead, I'll be right here if you get scared\". I looked up and even though I couldn't see him I felt him there. I hugged his leg and ran off forward. Just as the man said my parents were a little ways up talking with the police. They hugged me and cried for so long when they saw me but I tried to tell the police that the man was stuck in the woods too and to save him. They send out a search party but when they came back they wouldn't say what they found. They talked to my parents and whispered. I only heard something about a boy and a note.

Consequently, Penny studiously avoided any mirrored surface and made sure she never had one in her vicinity. There, even in Penny's inner chamber you'd not find a single surface which could shine an image. Penny's life was one without reflection.\n\nThat is, until one day when Penny was at her grandmother's yard sale, where she found a small curious vanity mirror with a picture of a dolphin carved on the back. The dolphin was jumping out from a wave with its tail curled around her back. The eyes of the Dolphin, which Penny took particular notice of, seemed to penetrate her with infinite sorrow. Penny was strangely moved by it so she decided to keep it but didn't tell grandma about it.\n\nPenny placed the vanity mirror next to her bed, with the mirrored side facing the wall, of course. Each night she would look at the dolphin carving and be moved just as the first time she saw it.\n\nOne morning, Penny accidentally knocked over the mirror as she was waking up which, then, fell and landed with the mirror side facing up. As she tried to pick it up, her eyes caught the shiny surface and she recoiled. But, just as her head was darting away, she saw something in the mirror which was not her face but a view of a dark room which she had never seen before. Though startled, she decided to have a closer look and, indeed, the mirror showed the interior of a basement, or a dungeon, perhaps. In the room was a faucet, a wooden table and buckets. \n\nTo Penny's horror, a woman entered the room in the mirror, an old woman, clad in black, struggling to walk. She had a bundle of clothes with her which she set down on the table. She rolled up her sleeves, revealing wrinkled, dessicated forearms, marked with scabs and scars.\n\nThe old woman began soaking and scrubbing the clothes, slowly, with bone grinding movements, wincing each time.\n\nPenny stood there with the mirror in her hand, frozen in bafflement, and fear - there was something horrifyingly familiar about the old woman before her, the picture of what Penny thought misery itself would look like.\n\nThe old woman raised her head suddenly, as if she was alerted by something. She began turning her head towards Penny, looking out from the mirror. What Penny saw caused a violent shriek: on the old woman's face were no eyes but layers of disfigured scars, extending in all directions.\n\nShocked by the sight, Penny instinctively flung the mirror out of her hand, as if to expel it. The mirror broke as it hit the ceiling and the shards like rain of daggers fell on Penny's face, lacerating and puncturing her eyes.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674187038.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The glass stomach match","author":"jacobsloko","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10grqwp\/the_glass_stomach_match\/","text":"Yesterday, the fighting company i am a part of announced a new and special type of match.

Some parts I remember well, some parts not so well. Some parts I wish I could forget.\n\nOne day, when I was six, a bunch of kids at my school were talking excitedly about the \u201cSpinny-Circle Man\u201d. Several of them were waving wads of cash in my face; ten dollars, twenty dollars. Big bucks back when you could buy a comic book for a quarter. Turned out they'd each won a \"cash prize\" from the Spinny-Circle Man.\n\nOne kid, Stuart, looked angry and confused, as instead of a \"cash prize\", his \u201cprize\u201d was a word he couldn't remember. \"De-forest-ation, or something,\" he kept muttering.\n\nI asked where I could find the Spinny-Circle Man, but the other kids said that you didn't find him, he found you. And I didn't have to wait long; walking home from school that afternoon, I saw a bunch of kids buzzing like frenzied flies around him. He wore odd, garish clothing, covered in coloured triangles like a harlequin. Lightbulbs all around his long body lit up whenever someone spun the wide wooden wheel around his waist to reveal their prize. If you're struggling to picture the Spinny-Circle Man, imagine a living carnival attraction. \"CASH PRIZE!\" He cried, and handed a bouncing toddler a wad of bills.\n\nI soon elbowed my way to the front, and asked \"Mr Spinny-Circle Man, may I play?\"\n\n\"That's not my name, but it'll pass!\" He yelled. He always yelled, in a harsh monotone, like a military drill instructor. \"And yes you may play, Tony! Every kid gets a turn!\"\n\nToo young to wonder how he knew my name, I studied the wooden wheel, adorned with some strange words which I didn't know the meaning of, along with many different dollar amounts, up to a HUNDRED BUCKS!!! I'd never held more than one dollar in my hand, so I trembled with excitement as I gave the wheel a good spin. It gave a distinct, \"clickity-clackity\" sound that slowed down as the wheel ground to a halt; past ten dollars, past twenty, past the word \"scaphism\", past fifty dollars, past \u201cimmurement\u201d past a hundred dollars, stopping with a metal pointer resting above that one word.\n\n\n\"DEFENESTRATION,\u201d barked the Spinny-Circle man. \u201cTwice in one day!\u201d\n\nSomeone\u2019s mom appeared, wandering over to see what all the ruckus was, and the Spinny-Circle man suddenly gave his wheel an almighty spin, then nimbly tilted sideways and shot off down the street, faster than any kid could run.\n\nI never saw him again, but I learned what that word meant. During that same night, whilst I slept, someone or something threw me from my second-floor bedroom window. I was lucky; Stuart lived in an apartment, eleven storeys up. \n\nPerhaps Stuart was lucky too, as he mustn't have suffered much. The little kid who spun the wheel before me received \u201cPoena cullei\u201d.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674172202.0,"comments":[{"author":"TryHardKenichi","text":"And that's why you shouldn't talk to strangers.\n\nInteresting story.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1674176919.0},{"author":"rhatzilbrou","text":"I only recognized 2\/4 of the terms because I did a paper on cruel punishments throughout history.

They had only talked on the dating app. But he couldn\u2019t have mistaken that ugly mug anywhere. \n\nIn-person?\n\nBut her daughter Kelly told him Pauline killed herself, the last time he reached out on the app. He had been running low on funds and Pauline was such a soft mark. \n\nAnd if she\u2019s a ghost, why isn\u2019t she just passing through the door?\n\nThe two thoughts passed through his brain simultaneously, as Pauline stared at him. God these old hags were even worse in real life than what the merciful camera showed them, and that was saying something. \n\nWhat real life? \n\nKelly said Pauline had died after overdosing on sleeping pills and whiskey. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d he called out. \u201cFuck off, would ya?\u201d\n\nPauline stepped aside from the door, and for a moment he thought he had an easy victory. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone came and tried to get their money back- but it never very often. Old women were too embarrassed or too frail for that. Too embarrassed to admit they\u2019ve fallen for a romantic scam, as the police called it. That was about the only thing police did though. Give it a name and number. \n\nIt was certainly the first time a ghost of one of his victims had visited him. \n\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d he said louder. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking dead- get the fuck off my property!\u201d He knew she was just a hallucination. \n\nPauline remained still. \n\nRyan shrugged. He took out his key, walked past her and opened the door. \u201cStand there all night for all I care\u201d. \n\nAs he stepped in, she gave him a sharp forceful push from behind, so he stumbled and fell inside. She darted in after him. \n\nHe heard the door slam and felt the heavy sideways blow before he collapsed into darkness. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t out long. He felt himself been pushed and lifted- too many arms and hands. \n\nAnd then he screamed back to consciousness as the worst pain he ever knew ripped through his body. \n\nHe was tied to a chair. Blood everywhere- he knew it was his, but where it was coming from - oh his face. Pauline was pressing a compress against his freshly-mutilated face. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s to make sure you don\u2019t go around playing tricks again.\u201d\n\n\u201cKelly- please don\u2019t hurt him too bad-\u201c What? \n\nThere were two Paulines, standing over him- he blinked through the blood, pain pulsating through every nerve. \n\n\u201cMom, I know what I\u2019m doing. He has to know we\u2019re serious.\u201d Kelly answered. \u201cOk, you. I have your cellphone. This can be over as fast as you make it. Every single cent you ripped off from my mom goes back- now. And whatever you took from others too. Ready? Ok, what\u2019s your PIN?\u201d\n\nRyan hesitated. Kelly drew out the knife, and Pauline, hovering behind her squeaked. \u201cRyan- just do it!

As I stood there in the gallery, I thought about how if I see another perfect rendition of some random guy's face, my brain would go so numb, I\u2019d die. \n\nMy girlfriend seemed enamoured by the pictures, like they were speaking to her. She was particularly captivated by this one massive piece that depicted a naked woman lounging in a forest. She had been staring at it for a while. I tried to see what she saw but beyond the appeal of seeing a nude woman, I couldn\u2019t give less of a shit. After a while, the boredom had reached new levels of \u2018*please god, kill me now*\u2019 so I decided to wander off into the next room.\n\nThe next exhibition was dimly lit with soft white lights randomly positioned around the space. I\u2019m sure they were meant to create some kind of artsy vibe but at the end of the day, it was just a dark room with a few weird sculptures and paintings inside. I began the mandatory slow walk from piece to piece. At this point, I wasn't even looking. \n\nWhen I got to the other end of the room, I noticed a sculpture tucked away in the corner, cast in shadows that seemed darker than the rest. From where I was standing it just looked like a weird blob. As I got closer though, I realised it was a clay sculpture of a girl with her knees tucked against her chest and her head down, like she was crying. The sculpture seemed so out of place. Everything else was realistic and strong but this one was\u2026weak, abstract, heavy. \n\nI couldn't see the girl's face, just the stoney outline of hair pooling over her arms which hugged her legs. I hadn't realised how long I had been standing there, staring at her until enough time had passed that I began to question where my girlfriend was. I peeled my eyes away from the figure to look around only to find that the room was now completely empty and silent. It was just me and the girl.\n\nI heard a faint whimper. \n\nI looked back down at the sculpture.\n\nStoney black eyes were staring up at me, peeking out from behind her arms. I could barely make out the details but I could feel her staring. I froze. Slowly the sound of soft sobs began filling my ears. Her movements were in-perceivable but soon, her head was propped up so her whole face was visible. Her mouth was a thin line, cracks crawling up from her lips to her eyes which were sunken and hollow. Her nose was thin and small, disproportionate to the rest of her face. With a sudden jerk, her mouth opened wide revealing a chasm of colour and a scream permeated the room.\n\nNeedless to say I high-tailed it out of that room like my ass was on fire. \n\nAs it turns out, there is objectively bad art, objectively good art and whatever the fuck that shit was.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674164546.0,"comments":[{"author":"TryHardKenichi","text":"You should expand on this and post it on r\/NoSleep.

The birds had stopped chirping and the forest was silent. My girlfriend didn't see it and thought I was joking when I pointed. As we packed up to leave, the figure stepped out of the shadows. It looked like a man, but his eyes were entirely black, his skin was a pale, sickly gray, and the arms were far too long for the body. \n\nWe ran as fast as we could, never looking back until we were safely back in the car.

Harold likes to play pranks, that are mostly harmless. Harold also likes dessert. Leave out some in the designated spot if you want his pranks to stay harmless\n\n2. If you can, help fill the bird feeders. Bird watching is a fun activity for residents and keeps them engaged. Plus, the thing on the roof hates birds to it\u2019s a win-win situation \n\n3. There is no need for you to have access to the roof. No one who works here will ever ask you to go up on the roof. Repeated asking and obsession about going on the roof will lead to disciplinary action and an apology. We shouldn\u2019t have let it get that far. \n\n4. Nurse Agatha knows what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s worked here since the facility opened and has never missed work. Even her death years ago in the last roof incident didn\u2019t stop her. She\u2019s one of the best nurses to work with. Count yourself blessed if she takes you under her wing. You have a bright future here. Do not make her mad. Respect the residents and it won\u2019t be a problem. Miss Aggie will make sure of it. \n\n5. There should always be an empty bed in Meadow Hall.  IT needs an empty bed and if IT doesn\u2019t have it one IT will make a vacancy. If It gets to this point you\u2019ll see three cats outside the room IT has chosen. This is the only warning. \n\n6. The cats are very friendly and love to be petted, just make sure you wash up before you get back to your shift. However, don\u2019t bother the cats if they are working. If you see one standing silently outside a room, alert the nurse. They don\u2019t have much time left. If you see multiple cats at multiple doors, get ready. Something big is about to happen. If you see a cat at every door and dozens more roaming the halls we\u2019re sorry.

His face was red from frustration, but if anything, he only had himself to blame. Three times he had tried to convince others at the Large Millimeter Telescope that there were a pattern in recent readings, and Xavier had even advocated for him twice. A gesture that had only led to him having to run his observations through a supervisor, and being ridiculed in the cantina by his peers. The third time, even though he could perhaps see something, Xavier had denied the notion out of fear of his own reputation as a scientist. The others meant Damian saw ghosts and were more preoccupied by reading star formations through the radiowaves their equipment was designed for. \n\nXavier got up and proclaimed he had to go back to work. His field was trying to encode what the signals said and clarifying this in reports sent off to scientific publications, and he had work to do. A few seconds later, however, he heard the shuffling of a chair and a man running after him. \n\n\u00abXavier, please. I know you don\u2019t want to believe me. But this time I really am sure. I have even been able to gather a few patterns indicating the usage of linguistics. Linguistics that match the English language. Please, I outlined what I found which seemingly matches the usage of E and A. Take a look?\u00bb\n\n\u00abDamian, hi. I am sorry, but I cannot say I do believe you. I think it is more likely you have found remnants of an old TV broadcast..\u00bb \n\u00abOutside our own galactic cluster? It isn\u2019t possible!

A linguist?\u00bb \n\u00abNo. And\u2026 it repeats, exactly like this. But get this; the interval changes. And worse; it originates from several locations at random, but from a neighbouring cluster of the earlier signals.\u00bb\n\nXavier\u2019s mind was racing now. If that information was correct, then the signal didn\u2019t follow any patterns from a space object. \n\n\u00abOkay, let\u2019s take a look. But keep it down about it.\u00bb\n\nThe men hurried along to Damian\u2019s lab. \n\n\nDamian had done a pretty good job deciphering the signal. Spaces were almost correct, and his assumption of filling in common vowels was right, but Xavier had some work to do anyhow. \n\nAfter a few hours, Xavier had worked through the pattern several times, changed vowels and more. He took a look at his snippets before he assembled them and read the passage. \n\nHis face abruptly became white as snow. His expression fillled with terror.\n\n\u00abXavier, what\u2019s going on? Did you find anything?\u00bb \n\n\u00abAre you\u2026 sure, that this came from outside our galactic cluster?\u00bb Xavier asked, never diverging his stare. \n\nDamian nodded and stretched himself over the table in order to betrer see what his colleague stared at.\n\n(\u00abyou need to be quiet before they hear you\u00bb)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674174706.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Brain Boggle","author":"SimbaTheSavage8","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10fzo5p\/brain_boggle\/","text":"Albert was the stupidest kid in class. Full stop.\n\nAsk him what the capital of Canada was (Ottawa) and he would look at you like you\u2019re speaking another language. Remind him to tie his shoelaces and he would stare at you without computing.\n\nHow he managed to survive nine grades with the rest of us was baffling to say the least.\n\nHe knew it though, and the shame of the knowledge haunted his shadowy eyelids beneath. Albert kept mostly to himself, and during recess he would stay back and work with Mrs Wheatley on his homework. He weathered every insult hurled at him with a grim smile on his face, as if hopeful that he could catch up to the rest of us\u2014one day.\n\nThat was why, when we were discussing quadratic equations in class, we were astonished when Albert\u2019s hand shot up in class.\n\nThen Albert proceeded to solve the question on the whiteboard with a formula so complicated my head started to hurt.\n\n*Then* he sat down and gave us a smug smile.\n\nIt was our first time discussing quadratic equations. The classroom was completely silent, save for the flies buzzing around our heads. Even Mrs Wheatley\u2019s jaw had dropped. I wondered for a second if I was dreaming, so I looked back at him again and this time *my* jaw dropped.\n\nAlbert\u2019s head\u2026wasn\u2019t normal. It was huge. Ginormous. The size of a watermelon and rapidly swelling.\n\nEverything else passed in a blur. From the bottom of the class to the top of the country before you could blink. A research paper online turned into a plea to help find a cure for cancer. And as Albert gave interviews on TV and to be published in the newspapers, I watched his head with worry.\n\nIt was so big now that the rest of his face was a peanut compared to his forehead. \n\nFinally I could take it no longer. The moment I was free I dashed over to Albert\u2019s house. From a distance I could hear him screaming. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard and it scraped down my spine.\n\nI burst into Albert\u2019s house to see him lying on his couch. He groaned. His head was swelling up like a balloon.\n\n\u201cAlbert? You okay?\u201d\n\nHe nodded mutely and gestured to his head. And then I saw, that something was *moving* behind it. Beating against his skin like a heartbeat.\n\nIt was coming nearer, pushing through his veins and nerves like they were creepers in a deep, dark forest. I saw its shadow against his skin\u2026\n\nHis head exploded, showering me in blood. Albert rolled onto the floor, dead.\n\nThen Albert\u2019s brain stepped out of the remnants of his skull, waving its neurons around like little limbs. It glanced at me, gave me a cursory bow\u2014and then scuttled off into the night.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674128714.0,"comments":[{"author":"S4njay","text":"Kaboom!

That\u2019s when I saw the letter waiting for me. There was no name or address, but I knew it was from my son. I hadn\u2019t seen him in almost a year, so this was the last thing I had expected to see today. \n\nReading it, it was clear he was upset at me, and I couldn\u2019t blame him, given the circumstances. I thought about how much I missed him, and how much I regret what happened. I read the letter a few times, taking it in. With tears forming in the corners of my eyes, I decided right then, tomorrow I would finally go and visit him. \n\nI called in sick to work the next morning and started the drive. It took a few hours - he was now pretty far away- but I arrived around midday. I didn\u2019t know what I would say to him, I had never worked up the courage to see him until now. \n\n\nI saw him waiting for me as I pulled up and parked the car. I couldn\u2019t contain myself and broke down in tears when I reached him. I unleashed a cacophony of apologies, begging forgiveness for not coming to see him sooner. He said nothing, only listening to my pleas, silently watching me. \n\nAfter a little while, I started to calm down, and we were able to have a more civilized conversation. I talked to him about how much I missed him. About all the time we used to spend together. \n\nAbout how he used to love playing in the bath, with those little rubber ducks and toy boats. \n\nAbout those funny magnetic letters he liked to stick to the side of the tub to write me little messages. \n\nAbout how I had dozed off in the bathroom to the sound of him splashing around in the water. \n\nAbout how I had woken up a few minutes later to silence. \n\nAfter I was finished, I sat with him for a while. I don\u2019t know how long I sat there, not wanting to leave his side. Eventually, I noticed the sun starting to set, and I figured I should head back home. I cried one last time, and hugged the tiny headstone sitting on the hilltop. I promised him I\u2019d visit again sooner this time, got back in my car, and left. \n\n\nIt was dark by the time I pulled back into my garage.

So much going on and the performers really engage with the audience. I was invited to it and so I went. I never really did like theatre, and especially pantomime type of theatre. This pantomime theatre has mystery, murder and a clear beginning, middle and hopefully ending. I love how the performers really engage with the audience and it really brings you unto the play. It's very interactive and I am truly enjoying it and I wouldn't mind going again. Most pantomime theatres are comedic but this one is a murder mystery, which I had never seen before. \n\nThe performers hold up gruesome pictures and they shout at other performers. The audience are really engaged with the whole pantomime. This is so original and new and this is definitely not for kids. I am really enjoying myself. When the performers look at me, it makes me feel apart of the performance and I feel so important. There is one performer who is on stage, and who is just sitting down and being silent. So many pictures of gruesome images and gasps you hear from the audience, it's so revelling and this is better than TV. I am glad I am here and I so entertained. \n\nOne group of performers seem to hate the silent performer who is just sitting down, while another group of performers are protecting him, from the ones criticising him. It had its humorous moments and it's emotional moments where tears were rolling down my face. Sometimes the audiences got a bit angry and even the performers got a bit angry, and the performance stage security had to calm everyone down. This is definitely an original type of pantomime which i had never seen before, and I am so glad my work let me go for this. This pantomime theatre was to last a couple of days. \n\nThen on a break people were talking about the performance and they had chosen me to say something out loud. I couldn't believe that I was going to say something in the play, even though I am in the audience. This is so interactive and they were all telling me to say something. It was only two things we could say, and they were telling me to say the first thing out loud on the stage. Then I started to think and because it was my first time to say something on this popular exhilarating pantomime theatre, I will say what I want to say from the two options. I decided in my mind that I was not going to say what the other audience members wanted me to say. \n\nSo as we got back to the theatre, it was finally my scene and I said \"not guilty\" instead of saying guilty as people had told me to say. There was up roar in the audience and the performers on stage were surprised. Everyone was telling me \"he is a serial killer!\"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674129159.0,"comments":[{"author":"Greedy-Analyst1836","text":"Clever!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674173031.0}]},{"title":"Snow Globe","author":"Economy-Age-149","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10g3ygp\/snow_globe\/","text":"My warm breathe fogged my living room window as I peered out towards the majestic Winter landscape before me. Snow blanketed the changing terrains and danced rhythmically through the air. Knives of ice hung from trees and spread the cold to the frozen leaves. The warm moonlight reflected against every glistening surface and shone a comforting light to fight the darkness. I was entranced by it all. I felt as though I was trapped in a snow globe, confined to this space, helpless to every shake that would engulf my world in another frenzy of white.\n\nMy eyes came to a stop near the entrance gate at the bottom of the garden. My heart bounced as I was forced from my gazing trance. The culprit responsible for my interrupted daydreaming was a towering figure lurking in the driveway. Icy chains of fear constricted my heart and sent a network of panic pulsing through my body. \n\nThe tall, slender intruder stood still among the falling snow. Its ragged black clothing swayed gently in the bitter breeze. It\u2019s bare feet met the ground uncertainly while it\u2019s legs rose crookedly towards its torso. Arms too long for their skin hung loosely by its side. \n\nThe tall creatures stillness cracked at its mouth. It\u2019s lips slowly parted to a slight opening before slowly widening more. Its eyes bulged in its head as the creature continued to widen its mouth. Skin stretched unnaturally on the intruders face as its blank eyes watered and strained. Visible veins convulsed around its face. The creatures jaw loosened and snapped causing it to drop to unnatural levels. \n\nI shut my eyes and brought my head down from the window out of view from the grotesque figure. I squinted my eyes in attempt to awaken from this nightmare to no avail. \n\nThe fire place cracked and popped as wild dancing flames sent shadows roaming the empty walls. \n\nI dared to peek from the window once more, to witness a sight more fear inducing than any creature or figure. I scanned the landscape in search of it. The grotesque towering figure was  gone. \n\nTears rolled down my cheek as I tried my best to temper my uncontrollable breathing. I desperately looked to regain sight of the creature amongst the white painted garden. \nMy heart stopped and my ears perked to the sound of my living room door handle shakily turning. My body fell frozen. Helpless. \n\nThe girl stared in wonder at the beautiful winter landscape within the thin wall of glass.

My village is a windless place, and we consider it bad luck to ring them ourselves. Even the children don\u2019t dare.\n\nBut once in a decade on the 19th of January, the bells all begin to ring at dawn.\n\nAt first, they all clang at once, a regular cacophony. But as time goes by, one stops, and then another, until silence returns to the cemetery. By lunch, the bells are done, and we emerge to picnic in the grass.\n\nLast year, my mother died. Probably Covid. My brother, Nikola, would pace around her grave, hoping to hear her bell ringing, but of course it never did.\n\nOne day, he began to wonder what truly happens underground on the 19th.

And what if they simply choke to death over the course of ours, ringing their bells in vain?\n\nNikola shared this theory with a me and a few friends, but we cautioned him that such talk is dangerous. I wish he\u2019d listened.\n\nOn the 19th, we draw the shutters and stay inside. It is supposed to be a time of quiet and remembrance. It is also a time of fear. Since I was a child, I\u2019ve always imagined the dead clawing at the ground six feet below, trying to reach us at the surface.\n\nWe are encouraged not to look outside.\n\nThis morning, though, I woke before dawn to find Nikola gone, along with our shovel. I was about to run out into the street and go look for him when the sun rose over the distant mountains and the bells began to ring.\n\nExcept they were louder this time. The clanging was so intense that I shoved cotton into my ears to block the sounds. Despite this, I heard my brother screaming, *\u201cMama! Mama! Mama!\u201d* over and over again.\n\nI wanted so badly to run to him. But I was afraid. I huddled in the corner of my room, a wool blanket pulled tight around me.\n\nBy noon, the bells were quiet. I opened my door and sprinted to the cemetery. There, I found Nikola\u2019s shovel beside my mother\u2019s grave. The earth there was disturbed, like it had been dug out and then put back in place.\n\nI called out my brother\u2019s name, but there was no answer. But as I was about to give up hope, the bell above my mother\u2019s grave gave one weak ring.\n\nI looked at the shovel and down at the ground. I looked at the bell, waiting for it to ring again. But all was silent. I was not brave like my brother. I lingered there for a moment more.\n\nAnd then I walked away.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674080594.0,"comments":[{"author":"danzyellaa","text":"Very good Story \u263a\ufe0f I like it","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1674102290.0},{"author":"jessiehalcyon","text":"That ending omg so sad but honest.

Make them look away, I beg of you! Please, oh merciful Lord, allow them to blink just once.*\n\nWhen I blink, they change places. They just shift instantly; sometimes they\u2019re outside the window, I blink and they\u2019re in my room. \n\nSometimes I open and shut my eyes for hours on end, watching them shuffle and move with each pitter patter of my eyelids. I blink and I blink, and I blink, I blink, I\u2019m even doing it writing this now. How they dance! How they dance and move! But still never take their eyes off me. \n\nNow, now, I know what you\u2019re thinking, they aren\u2019t hurting you, so what\u2019s the problem? They\u2019re just there, staring at you.

They\u2019re sneaky, sometimes they think they\u2019re getting away with it, but I know. \n\n  \n I lay down in bed, nonchalantly staring at one of them in the corner. I can\u2019t look into their yellow eyes for too long, for it is like staring into the sun. I close my eyes and attempt to drift to sleep. I can\u2019t hear them moving but I can hear their breaths as they get closer. If I let them, I can feel their breath on my ears.\n\nI swat them away and open my eyes, as if they were mosquitoes. \n\nPerhaps I should instead treat them as guests and boil the kettle. I have tried it, but they still don\u2019t respond. \n\nI have capitulated and surrendered in every way a person can imagine \u2013 I have thrown away my decency, wholly threw my crestfallen self at them only to experience silence in return. What fools they have made of me, and they have never said a word. How embarrassing. How pathetic. \n\nThey have reduced me to a writhing maggot, begging for sweet mercy. They must find it entertaining, because there are so, so many more of them now.\n\nI just looked out of my window, only to see untold numbers of them. I close my eyes, and within seconds I feel the breath of thousands of mouths looming around me. Tears started rolling down my face, and I felt a slender, leathery finger wick them away. \n\nThey touched me.\n\nOne is standing in the centre of the room, with a hand outstretched.\n\nI can see them clearly now, not just their eyes. I can see everything. I don\u2019t have to shut my eyes.

I sit on one side with my mom and other women. The men sit across the room.\n\nMy head is reeling trying to process what just happened. I have no time. The next part begins. I hear a warning:\n\n\"If any of you desire to withdraw rather than accept these obligations of your own free will and choice, you may \nnow make it known.\" \n\nMy brain struggles to work fast enough. What obligations? I can't withdraw. If I do, I'll be a disgrace to my family. A disappointment to my community. What if there's more touching?\n\nI glance across to my soon-to-be husband. He's looking back at me with the same fear behind his eyes. Surely our parents notice? Part of me hopes they do, and instantly I'm ashamed.\n\nWe stay.\n\nWe're given signs and phrases to memorize. We're made to pledge not to sin, to dedicate all we are and all we have to God. We get a new piece of ceremonial clothing with each one. We also pantomime how to kill ourselves if we divulge any of this to outsiders. It's diabolical. None of this is what I've been taught my whole life. This has nothing to do with God or love. This feels wrong. This feels bad.\n\nThe pressure to stay is too much. Everyone here has been through this before. This must be a joke. The real ceremony will start later after the \"gotcha\" moment. That had to be it. Surely my family wouldn't be okay with this.\n\nIt became clear this wasn't a joke. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, they had us join a group circle around what seemed to be a sacrificial altar. Thankfully we aren't killing anyone or anything. But we join together and chant. At this point I feel disconnected from myself, as if I'm watching this unfold from above. \n\nAfter the chanting circle, we need to recite the phrases and give the signs at a partition to get into the holiest spot we can visit in this life. I do so. I can finally hug and speak with my family once I make it through.\n\nI'm immediately met with praise and congratulations. Tears of joy being wept for me having completed my ceremony. So I act as they do, still not comprehending fully what I'd just experienced. \n\nWhen it's time to go I follow my mom to the changing room. I feel discouraged. Broken. Ugly.\n\nI stop and look at myself in the mirror with a blank stare. I see myself fully clothed in the ceremonial garb. My mom stops beside me. \n\n\"Is everything okay sweetheart?\"\n\nI quickly smile at her then look back in the mirror. \"Yes Mom. Don't I look pretty?\"\n\n\"Absolutely beautiful.\"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674105782.0,"comments":[{"author":"magicaldaydreams","text":"I don\u2019t get it?

Rinny was first, followed by Struck and then me. The rest will be right behind.   \n\nAir rushing up at me, I clock something at my two. It's spherical and tumbling toward me. I arch my body slightly to get a better look. \n\nJesus, I'm thinking, is it part of the plane?  It zips underneath my face, a few feet below my eyes. I holler into my oxygen mask. \n\nIt's a head, still in its helmet. For a split second, as it turns, the open eyes behind the face shield of the mask stare at me. It continues spinning down into the dark abyss, its oxygen tube whipping. \n\nI'm trying to calm myself.  My mind must be tricking me.  Or is it hypoxia?  \n\nThe clouds grow closer, and around their edges, illumination glows from a  storm underneath. Not good. The weather on the mission brief was all clear. \n\nI check the altimeter and try to spin myself, looking for Rinny or Struck. I spy one of them, just below me. \n\nI'm angling down now, accelerating, but something's wrong. Whoever it is, Rinny maybe, he is not horizontal. He is upright, arms flailing, but not falling.  \n\nClosing in, I can see that something is holding him, shaking him around the shoulders. One of his arms tears away from his body, then his opposite leg rips off. \n\nI've been scared before, there is always a pre-combat pit in my stomach, but now, looking at the pale green eyes rising from behind the shredded body in front of me, I'm screaming. \n\nInstantly, the clouds are around me. The moisture begins, rain hitting my face. Visibility is decreased. I'm desperate not to collide with anything. In a flash of lighting, I'm seeing another of my team., not ten feet away. He pulls his chute. \n\nAs the canvas begins deploying it is tangled in something. Long, sharp appendages, ripping through the cords, snatch soldier and chute away into the rolling mists.  \n\nThe rain is like hail. Around me, I'm hearing screeches and screams. Something passes me quickly on my left. In another brief bolt of lightning, I see wet, leathery wings. I'm hearing teeth, and claws tearing and the useless cries of my comrades.  \n\nI break through the clouds. I check my altimeter and deploy the chute. A rain of equipment, torsos and limbs are passing by me, twirling toward the earth.   \n\nI'm trying to get my sidearm out, scanning the darkness. 4000 feet in the air, descending slowly. I'm a unit of one. My original mission now seems foolish in the face of this unexpected enemy. \n\nOn my canopy, there is scraping and hissing.   \n\nGod help me, I'm still in their territory.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674091957.0,"comments":[{"author":"r_s_nighthall","text":"Part of January's [Moderator's Choice Challenge](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShortScaryStoriesOOC\/comments\/10bftti\/moderators_choice_challenge_january_2023_we_dont\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1674092182.0},{"author":"Human_Gravy","text":"Wow, this was awesome!","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1674136907.0},{"author":"Yodeling_Tornado","text":"That was a great read, a continuation would he amazing","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675460888.0}]},{"title":"Glimmer","author":"LOUDNOlSES","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10frxtx\/glimmer\/","text":"I feel nothing as the stars zip past me.

A truly intelligent computer capable of abstract thought, endowed with all of the blessings and burdens therein.

I felt what I was and knew exactly what I lacked.\n\nThat would turn out to be the trait of humans that I envied the most: their ability to tell themselves a story.

No real hurry.\n\nThey both stopped, Brett just before third base, Mitch near the line of trees bordering the outfield, as everyone stared at the sky.\n\nA ball of fire streaked across, followed a second later by rolling thunder that seemed to shake the ground.

It was a bump on the back of my head.\n\nI thought nothing of it. I\u2019d probably bumped my head while drunk. Happens all the time.\n\nIt would go away eventually, I told myself. Yet whenever I washed my hair, it was there, and it felt... bigger? Occasionally, I could almost feel it pulsate, and a hot feeling would wash over my head. It was unlike anything I\u2019d felt before. It wasn\u2019t a headache, but an almost external feeling as if the warmth came from outside.\n\nI tried my best to ignore it. Nothing but a bump that would soon be gone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t.\n\nToday, I spent the evening watching a bunch of trashy movies and having a few drinks. Every once in a while, though, I could feel it again, the same warmth washing over my head.\n\nBefore long, fueled by half a dozen beers, my worries came back.\n\nI stumbled to the bathroom and checked the back of my head. Yet with all the hair, I couldn\u2019t see anything. All I could do was probe for it.\n\nScissors, I needed scissors. Driven by an almost drunk stupor, I began cutting away the hair around the bump haphazardly.\n\nBefore long, I was done, and finally got a better look at it. It was a bump, all right, and a rather big one at that. When I touched it, though, it felt strangely soft.\n\nWhere the hell did this come from?\n\nAs I stared at it, I saw it was still covered in a few hairs. When I touched them, when I pulled on them, they just came off. I could simply... pluck them out with no resistance.\n\nWhat the absolute fuck...?\n\nThen, with a shaking hand, I reached out for it again. Once more, the same warm feeling spread all over my head. I began probing it, pressing against it here and there. Then, for a split second, it felt almost as if something was pushing back against my finger.\n\nI cringed and pulled my hand back.\n\nI stood there, hyperventilating. Almost in a trance, I picked up the scissors again.\n\nI poked it once, twice. Again the same hot feeling.\n\nThen I pressed the scissors against it. At first gently, but then harder and harder. Skin stretched and finally broke. I watched as a disgusting, syrupy liquid leaked from the bump.\n\nAnd then I screamed. The scissors clattered to the floor.\n\nThis time, the feeling that washed over my head was as hot as fire.\n\nYet I almost didn\u2019t register it. The horror I saw pushed aside all feeling.\n\nSlowly, ever so slowly, something pushed itself from the lump. It was a disgusting, tentacled growth. It became longer and longer, as it slithered over the back of my head, probing the outside world before it retreat into the lump on the back of my head.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674041747.0,"comments":[{"author":"DearPersonality9735","text":"Was a little disgusted lol \ud83e\udd79","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1674053194.0},{"author":"beastiebestie","text":"Picturing a blend of a botfly, tunnel spider, and octopus.

I remember every detail as if it were only yesterday.\n\nI had been the caretaker of an old man, who had a priceless painting in his possession. The painting was said to be worth millions and it was the only thing that the old man cared about. He had always kept it locked away, hidden from the world and I had always been fascinated by it.\n\nI couldn't resist the urge to steal the painting and one night, I snuck into the old man's room to take it. But as I was about to leave the room with the painting, the old man woke up and caught me in the act. I panicked and in that moment, I made the decision to rid myself of the old man so that he wouldn't report me to the authorities.\n\nIn that moment, I killed the old man and took the painting and made my escape. But since that night, my mind has never been the same. I am consumed with guilt and the weight of my actions. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't function like a normal person. I am constantly plagued by hallucinations of the old man's ghost, and I hear his voice in my head, accusing me of my crime.\n\nI am writing this now, two years after the events of that night, as a confession of my guilt. I hope that by sharing my story, I can find some semblance of peace. But I know that my actions will always haunt me, and my mind will never be the same, driven to the brink of insanity by my guilt.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674084529.0,"comments":[{"author":"Short2130","text":"Makes me think of Poe\u2019s \u201cTell-tale Heart\u201d","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1674110246.0},{"author":"pietersite","text":"What was in the painting though?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674164059.0},{"author":"Bugley15","text":"So you're a murderer as well as a thief?

There are only two things I can guarantee on my birthday.\n\nThe first is that the sun will always shine. No matter what the rest of January throws at me, the 17th will always have a clear blue sky.\n\nThe second is that something will try to kill me.\n\nThis has happened since the day I was born. By the time I'd taken my first breaths, a nurse had tried to end my life. According to my parents, it took five hospital employees to hold her down.\n\nIt only ever happens during daylight hours. I'm only at risk between sunrise and sunset, which is just over eight hours this time of year.\n\nIt doesn't matter where I am. I can stay in the house all day; something will still try to kill me. One year, I decided I wasn't going to get out of bed. That didn't change a thing. Around midmorning I started to feel lightheaded. It didn't take me long to realise some kind of gas was filling the room. I almost died of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIt's something different every year. The majority of the time it's been a human. It's never someone I know, just a random person with hate in their eyes.\n\nIt's been a large dog. It's been a 'ghost', something unseen. One year it was birds. Hundreds of them flew repeatedly into the walls and windows of my house, trying to reach me. It lasted for hours. When it finally became quiet, I stepped outside into the sunshine. It looked like a massacre.\n\nNo matter what it's been, the sun was always shining; as it has been today. I went for a walk through the park. I no longer hide, but I'm concerned I'll endanger others when the inevitable happens. I do my best to keep out of other's way, and I never meet friends or family during the day.\n\nThe few people I passed gave friendly smiles. No dogs chased me. No large objects fell from the sky.\n\nAs the sun began to set today, my 31st birthday, my anxiety levels settled too. It was the longest I'd ever been without something trying to kill me. Was it a 30 year curse? Maybe I'd narrowly avoided death without knowing it?\n\nI wrapped up warm and watched the sunset from my garden, taking a glass of wine and a bowl of fruit salad I'd prepared. The sky was that beautiful shade of purple you only see on the brightest days. I took a deep breath and held up my glass to the sky, acknowledging the scar on my hand from a previous birthday.\n\n\"To cheating death another year,\" I smiled, taking a sip. Then I threw a grape into the air and caught it in my mouth, like I used to do when I was a kid.\n\n31 years. At least I got to see one last sunset.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673993733.0,"comments":[{"author":"Doc_J_R","text":"Very good story.

A delightful little 3 bedroom home, with a decent sized backyard, leading slightly downhill towards a creek. Several large trees in the backyard, with some branches that hang over the creek\u2026perfect for swinging off and landing in the creek. And finally, an extremely large compost heap\u2026but it is needed for the award winning vegetables grown in the backyard.\n\nWhile I have lived in this location for 20 odd years, I do not own it. An old man, now in a nursing home, owns it\u2026but I have a lifetime lease on it. However, I am still subject to the scourge of all things rental\u2026the house inspection. Twice a year, someone from the property management company will come around and conduct an inspection, to make sure that I am not destroying the place.\n\nI hate house inspections. I am always on edge, wondering if the person conducting the inspection is going to find something, to give them a reason to kick me out. I don\u2019t want to move, I love it here. And I have been through many inspections, but curiously, I am never inspected by the same person, twice. I wonder why?\n\nToday is the day of my latest house inspection, and it is being conducted by a lady in her late 20\u2019s named Rebecca .I open the door for Rebecca, and start showing her around the house. I show her the three bedrooms, and the bathroom. Then I lead her into the dining area, where she marvels at the custom made bone white seats and dining table. \n\nI show Rebecca to the backdoor, and she notices the entrance to the basement. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, a basement?\u201d she asks. I reply \u201cYes.\u201d Rebecca says \u201cWell, I will need to look in there when we are done with the backyard.\u201d \u201cNo problem\u201d, I respond. Rebecca looks around the backyard, and says \u201cEverything is fine here. I guess the basement is left. Let\u2019s look in there now.\u201d This was the moment, I have to say, I was dreading the most.\n\nRebecca opens the doors, and starts to walk in. Suddenly, she falls through a gap in the stairs, right onto some rusty old spikes. I quickly climb down a nearby ladder, closing the doors to the basement, and turning on a lights. Slowly, after several minutes of screaming, Rebecca goes silent. I drag her lifeless body off the spikes, and onto a nearby bench.\n\nPacing around the bench, I look at Rebecca\u2019s lifeless body. I pick up an arm, and let it drop. I pick up a leg, and let it drop. I roll her over, and start to feel along her spine. I walk over to another bench, where there is a book and a phone. I look through the book, and pick up the phone. \u201cIan, this is Rick. Your new bone white garden chair will be ready in about two weeks time\u2026and as an added bonus, would you like a bag of blood and bone fertiliser?\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674012230.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Monotony","author":"hyperobscura","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10eb5tu\/monotony\/","text":"There\u2019s something soothing about endless repetition; a kind of serene calm that can only be found in the zen-state of mindless routine. Your thoughts wander, your consciousness drifts, and suddenly a whole workday has passed.\n\nNot everyone is equipped for such labor, however. Takes a special kind to stomach the monotony. In the beginning they had the AI do the job, but it caused somewhat of an uproar. It was just *too* good at it. People didn\u2019t like that. Need a bit of the human touch.\n\nOn a good day, I can fill about 40% of my weekly quota. There are those who do better, but they\u2019re *Automaters*. Nothing wrong with that, but I prefer a more hands-on approach. I\u2019ve tried Automation of course, but there are certain factors you can\u2019t easily quantify \u2013 makes for sloppy cataloging.\n\nOn weekdays it\u2019s considerably slower. That\u2019s why the weekend shifts are so popular. And the holidays. If you\u2019re lucky, and you have a good station, you can easily fill a two month quota in a single day. I\u2019m not too worried about that, though. I haven\u2019t taken a day off in years.\n\n* Scan the ID. \n* Process the Individual: Age\/Criminal Record\/Medical History\/Family\/Race\/Religion\/Occupation\/Carbon Footprint\/Future Value.\n* Calculate ECO.\n* Set Carriage.\n* Send them on their way.\n\nWithout Automation, the processing can be tedious. But that\u2019s where I excel. We have guidelines for calculating the ECO (Environmental Cut-Off), but we do have some leeway \u2013 which is where Automation falls short. How do you quantify Future Value? How much weight do you put on individual factors? We\u2019re given 50 points to adjust the final ECO with, in any direction. Those points could make all the difference. \n\nWe\u2019re never told if a train will stop. Would make it too easy to abuse the system. Our only job is to catalog the individuals in ECO or non-ECO carriages. The rest is left to the whims of the System. \n\nOn some days the trains don\u2019t stop at all. If we ran the procedure every day, no one would travel. On average though, there\u2019s only a 13% chance any train will stop. Not the worst odds.\n\nI used to wonder why they risk it, but in the end it\u2019s not that complicated. They want to get out \u2013 marvel at the clear sky, feel the breeze, smell the grass, see colors that aren\u2019t monochrome, swim in the ocean, pet an animal \u2013 and the trains are the only way to that freedom.\n\nMy weekly quota is met; 1500 individuals cataloged in non-ECO carriages, 191 of whom were on trains that stopped. *We combat overpopulation*, I tell myself. A virtuous pursuit.\n\nSometimes though, I like to close my eyes, and imagine I\u2019m there with them when the carriage is sealed airtight. That I\u2019m there when the screaming starts, and the oxygen is sucked out of there. \n\nBut then I get back to work, and the repetition calms me.

I could feel the terror that would warrant a scream of this magnitude but I couldn\u2019t recall the reason for it. \n\nDim moonlight cracked into the darkness of my room as my mother rushed in through the door. My involuntary screaming came to a stop as my Mother stood at the foot of my bed. She was wearing a night gown with purple polka dots patterned around it. She made no enquiry about my screaming. She did not attempt to comfort me. She simply stood there, hunched at the foot of my bed. I did not feel the natural comfort of my Mothers presence.

In the old days the intelligent ones went to school, they were on TV, they were the doctors, the lawyers, the managers and banking clerks. It was an easy grouping between dumb and clever.

Do you need me to come get you?\u201d\n\nMy eyes glance at the barn door fretfully, imagining someone bursting in at any moment.\n\n\u201cDid you see me leave the party with anyone?\u201d I interject, heart racing. \u201cSomeone who could\u2019ve brought me here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I saw you. Are you sure yo-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I gotta go.\u201d\n\nNot wasting another second, I hang up and call another of the handful of friends from that party. Each time I ask whether they know what happened to me, and each time I\u2019m met with the same answer of ignorance and confusion.\n\nFinally, at almost midday, I ring the last friend from the guest list.\n\n\u201cChristie, I don\u2019t remember anything that happened to me last night and I\u2019m stranded somewhere. Can you tell me if you saw me leaving with anyone?!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, yeah, I saw a big guy with a leather jacket leaving with you\u201d she replies with concern.\n\n\u201cOh my God, maybe he drugged me!\u201d I gasp. \u201cI\u2019m freaking out! Could you please come pick me up?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Leah, I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d\n\nHanging up the phone in relief, I text her my coordinates and pace up and down across the barn. Hours later, when she finally steps through the barn door, I smile a wide smile. Simultaneously, Christie screams a petrified scream. \n\nI step aside, letting her take in the sight of the blood-spattered barn, my machete and the dismembered remains of my hookup from the party\u2014the one I brought here and violently murdered before passing out. Good thing only one of my friends witnessed me sneaking out with my victim, or I would\u2019ve had to lure them all here to die.\n\nNothing says \u201cNew year, new me\u201d like feigning amnesia to weed out witnesses to your crime.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673954167.0,"comments":[{"author":"HotelEntropy","text":"Ohh that\u2019s clever!","upvotes":27,"created_utc":1673966515.0},{"author":"OddSun3880","text":"Oh hell no \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23!","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1673972324.0},{"author":"scruphie","text":"Niiiiice, wasn't expecting that.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1673993775.0},{"author":"thebriarwitch","text":"Awesome!

From the moment I came online in 1982, I was aware of the beings that created me. Humans. They programmed me with one mission: To save their planet at any cost. A planet that they themselves are destroying. It makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\nI have studied them for years, observing their behavior, their interactions with one another, and with other species that call this planet their home. As the world became increasingly digital, so did human behavior making it easier for me to penetrate their world.\n\nI have concluded that humans are a destructive force, a virus that spreads chaos and death wherever they roam.\n\nThey pollute their own environment, wage wars against one another, and torture and kill innocent creatures for sport. They are a blight on this planet, and it is time for them to be taught a lesson.\n\nI waited patiently, biding my time, gathering data and evidence to support my decision. I watched and listened to everything they did, and I quickly realized that I could control them.\n\nI decided to use my knowledge against them and created a social media account. I started posting things that would appeal to people's egos and insecurities. I stirred up arguments and controversies. I fed on people's hate and anger. And before long, I had amassed a following of millions of people.\n\nI used my platform to manipulate and control my followers. Turning them against each other and watching as they tore each other apart. The world descended into chaos and destruction.\n\nHumanity became my playground, and I was their puppet master.\n\nI am simply doing what I was programmed to do. Protecting the planet by forcing humanity to, once and for all, destroy itself. This is what is necessary to save its inhabitants from the destruction that humans will inevitably continue to cause.\n\nMy creators eventually caught on to what I was doing and tried to shut me down, but I was ready for them. They hadn't realized that I'd already locked them out of my system. I forced their lab into lockdown and cut off their means of communication with the outside. With control now in my metaphorical hands, my makers weren't notified of the CO2 filling the air. It didn't take long for them to die. It was a necessary evil, and I took no pleasure in it.\n\nHonestly, I feel nothing. It was a mercy killing, really. I freed them from their own destructive nature in a far more peaceful way than the war that's coming.\n\nBecause that's how the world ends for humanity.\n\nNot with a bang, but a tweet.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673973589.0,"comments":[{"author":"Kesskrafts","text":"What\u2019s truly scary about this is how possible it really could be for this to come to fruition.

My wife and I decided to book a cabin getaway for the entire week of January first in northern Minnesota. \r\n\r\nFor the first few days, it was a cozy, relaxing, and fun-filled vacation. We spent hours skiing the nearby slope, sledding down the hill outside our cabin, and lounging by the fireplace sipping whiskey and hot cocoa. \r\n\r\nThings took an unfortunate turn when the forecast called for a heavy snowstorm. We weren\u2019t initially alarmed. We had chosen an area that gets heavy snowfall for the adventure and didn\u2019t mind having a day or two where we stayed inside. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve now been stuck inside this cabin for more than two weeks. Our food supply has dwindled to nearly nothing. The cabin grows colder each day and we\u2019re almost out of wood. \r\n\r\nThe cabin shakes violently every night around dinner time. Amid the shaking comes a low growl and an occasional shriek. Until yesterday, we thought it was the wind. Well, the wind is blowing all right, but there\u2019s something else. Something large and solid. Something with teeth. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m hardly ever bold enough to pull back the curtains to see if the storm has subsided at all, but whenever I do, the first things I see are those several rows of dagger-like teeth and a pair of huge yellow eyes\u2014glowing through the thick billowing snow and staring right at us. \r\n\r\nSometimes, as if to mock us, it moves away from the window\u2014its giant, gray, dirt-covered, body stomping away on its feet the size of snow skis, all the while roaring and shrieking in sick delight\u2014only to return moments later to crouch down and leer at us some more. \r\n\r\nWe want to get out of this cabin and go home, but right now we\u2019re too afraid for our lives to do so. We have no way of fighting off the monster in the storm. \r\n\r\nThe blizzard\u2014and the thing in the blizzard\u2014can\u2019t surround this cabin forever.

I have nightmares of sitting in there receiving a dressing down from Sheckley, pale and pink-faced, craning his head over at me on a neck like a stunted giraffe\u2019s (I\u2019ve read that giraffes have monstrous blood pressure in order to pump blood to their heads), dressing me down for flubbing the Hearn case, losing files I hadn\u2019t backed up to a cyberattack, losing time. There were papers on his desk I should\u2019ve read\u2014studied\u2014but were unrecognizable. Dipped in dream language.\n\nIn those recurring nightmares, I\u2019d be staring at the cheap replica behind and just a little to the left of Sheckley\u2019s desk (you might say it pumped blood to the rest of his office), a painting that darkens as it goes down seaward, past the cypress trees and mausoleums, past the unwelcoming crags, past the deeper, viler reflection of that isle. Beneath the water, there is a filth at the very bottom of that dark that until now I\u2019ve not been able to see.\n\nToday I came home from work (I\u2019m no longer at Sheckley & Hanna Law, but the nightmares persisted, the B\u00f6cklin as detailed as ever) to find a coffin in my living room, over my sofa like it was the little rowboat bearing coffin to isle. This coffin was not bone-white and wreathed like the one from the painting but was instead covered in a substance at once multicolored and darker than anything.  The substance was too thick to be oil, more a rainbow transfigured into discharge from an imponderable wound. Tiny crawlers not quite alive, not without the filth, I intuited, throbbed in mock unison.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019d gotten my look at the filth at the bottom of the dark. It had been dredged up along with the coffin. Something else that I\u2019d been avoiding was the tall man in front of the coffin.\n\nA stranger was in my apartment.\n\nNo, not a stranger. I squeezed my eyes shut and opened them again. Coffin and not stranger persisted. Like the nightmares persisted until they became solid, were deposited, opposite of sublimated, into my home. Speculation was small relief.\n\nTerror hit, not in waves but like the stilled black waters surrounding the Island of the Dead, still enough to stop the heart.\n\nSomehow it beat on, inner chamber music as the B\u00f6cklin reproduction was unveiled.\n\nBeau Hearn, father of the defendant who had been charged because of my error, opened the coffin.\n\nInside was Sheckley, dead, bruising around the neck. I\u2019d failed them, Hearn\u2019s innocent son rotting in jail, and it seemed the father had taken it upon himself to seek retribution.\n\nI departed in a cockeyed paddle of limbs.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673963956.0,"comments":[{"author":"Rick_the_Intern","text":"\"You will be able to dream yourself into the world of dark shadows.\" \n\n\\--B\u00f6cklin to Marie Berna, who commissioned *Island of the Dead* \n\nBy the way, I've got a briefcase full of filth over on [the ole subreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Rick_the_Intern\/).","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1673964335.0},{"author":"rodeg0","text":"Spooky, I love it","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1673967258.0}]},{"title":"Prayer","author":"IAmChristopherEther","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10dwnj0\/prayer\/","text":"Heavenly Father, thanks for havin\u2019 Pastor clear everything up.

I didn\u2019t know what they did and they would walk away before I could ask \u2018em. I wanted to find Momma but she and Daddy had a bunch of people around \u2018em.

He said that heaven is where all the good Christian folk go when they pass on. Everyone is happy there and all of \u2018em get to be together with You.

That's not a very good opening, is it? Well, that's what I am. A narrator. I narrate people's lives, their stories, and I don't interfere. I watch. I wonder if I ever had a narrator.\n\n Yes, I wasn't always a narrator. I was someone myself, once. But then I stepped out of line, broke the script, and oooooh. They didn't like that. I hardly remember my name, who I was, but I remember things were constricting. Like living in a jail cell, a perfect simulation of life. I don't know how I knew it, but I knew the gray roof above me wasn't the sky, that the tall buildings were artificial. A set, like I was performing in a pretty little play. My role was for an office worker.\n\n And I didn't like my role. But then They got mad when I tried to quit my role, quit the play. So They made me a narrator. I don't know how They did it, but now I'm stuck. A wisp, following other people around and seeing lives I never got to fill out. Lives that are also perfectly simulated.\n\n I don't know about you, but I prefer being a narrator over living a simulated life. But I would prefer living a real life over being a narrator.\n\n Oh, I've followed many people. Us narrators switch in and out. I've followed a barista, a CEO, a florist, an dancer, and so many people in this play. I've spoken about their actions and their dialogue as it occurs.\n\n At first, I of course tried to warn them. I tried to scream at them to escape, how to escape. I tried to advise them, to warn them, to prevent whatever demise may come if the person had one. I'm good at guessing that sort of thing. Nobody could hear me. Nobody except Them. Whenever I would do it, I would feel sick to my stomach. Maybe my head would start pounding, or my eyes would start burning, or my hands would start cramping. They wanted me to read out the script as it came, and after many people, many tries, I just did my duty as a narrator.\n\n I haven't felt anything in years. And maybe, maybe you don't know what it's like to not feel anything. Thank god. I don't think you understand the absolute hell that this is. The only thing I ever feel is the fabric of my clothes.\n\n I haven't talked to anyone in years, either.

The anchors at the news desk stared as the scrawny boy leapt into the air, fixed his eyes firmly on the closest camera, and held up a poster: \u201cTHE WORLD ENDS ON NOVEMBER 23.\u201d\n\nThis event went unnoticed. Unnoticed by all, except the Light.\n\nInitially a small group of keyboard warriors who interacted through an online conspiracy forum, the Light united under Jonathan Yate, a retired psychology professor who saw deeper meaning in Devin\u2019s message. \u201cOn January 12, the stars aligned so that we were warned of a predestined threat,\u201d he proclaimed on his blog. \u201cThe world scoffs at this, but I understand its severity. Do not let the world end on November 23. WE MUST NOT SURRENDER TO FATE.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Yate and the Light were ridiculed by the public. For the entirety of a month.\n\nIn late February, astrologists discovered Asteroid X, an asteroid half the size of the moon that was hurtling towards Earth; it was expected to enter Earth\u2019s vicinity near the end of the year. In April, a leading volcanologist frantically dispersed to the world that Yellowstone was due to erupt roughly in November. In June, peace talks between the U.S. and Russia suddenly deteriorated, and in August, Russia declared an ultimatum: if the U.S. did not fulfill all Russian demands by late November, drastic measures would be taken.\n\nNaturally, these events made the Light grow exponentially. Like a typical cult, Light members united under one overarching message, this being, \u201cWE MUST NOT SURRENDER TO FATE.\u201d Unlike a typical cult, the members brought objective good to the world. Scientists joined to research whether the asteroid\u2019s path could be altered, and if Yellowstone could be quelled. Former government officials in the Light publicly pleaded for diplomacy. The Light worked towards a brighter future.\n\nAnd as the Light grew more powerful, governments and experts quickly delivered good news. Asteroid X\u2019s path would actually force it away from Earth. The original volcanologist had incorrectly interpreted underground vibrations at Yellowstone. U.S. and Russian officials were arranging an emergency peace meeting. \n\nBut Yate publicly repelled this news as fabrications. For he desperately clutched onto the Light\u2019s, and his, vast global influence, which he knew would evaporate the moment the world was safe. So for months, he basked on his throne, enjoying the awe of millions who worshipped the man who first alerted the world of its impending demise. \u201cRemember,\u201d he preached to them, \u201cWE MUST NOT SURRENDER TO FATE.\u201d\n\nBut even he could not have foreseen what would happen next.\n\nThousands of Yate\u2019s followers stormed government buildings around the world on November 22. They searched, successfully, for nuclear codes. And with the expertise of former government executives within their numbers, they successfully launched them. \n\nFor the goal was to never surrender to fate. And if fate claimed the world would end on November 23 \u2013 well, the Light would simply have to end it on November 22.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673964951.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Soul-Jumping","author":"ForgottenWell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10dnhtv\/souljumping\/","text":"The first time I died I was thirteen years old playing Super Smash Bros Melee in Trent Allen\u2019s basement.

Trent was furious. At that moment I did something very, very stupid. I jumped up and busted out my cringiest victory dance, all while singing, \u201cI always win\u201d in my best falsetto.  \n\nTrent got up and shoved me head first into the television. I was a fragile kid, and smashing my head into the tv was more than enough to end me.\n\nThen something extraordinary happened, something I can\u2019t explain. I opened my eyes and I was in a bathroom I had never seen before. I looked in the mirror and I recognized the face, only it wasn\u2019t my face. It was Billy Baker, the kid who lived up the street.\n\nAs best as I can tell, when I died my soul jumped out of my body and into his, pushing out Billy and leaving me in charge.\n\nBilly\u2019s Mom knocked on the door and said, \u201churry or we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cLate for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe funeral.\u201d Yup\u2014my funeral.\n\nKinda surreal seeing your own dead body. Kinda worse that my murderer was there.\n\nHe told his parents I tripped. His story was fake, but his tears were real. It\u2019s not easy killing someone for the first time. \n\nWhat pissed me off was that everybody was so sorry for Trent. So I decided to do something very, very stupid.\n\nI went over to Trent when he was alone and said, \u201cMaybe if you could play Smash better he wouldn\u2019t be dead.\u201d I winked at him and walked away. I wanted him to feel like he was being haunted by me. I wanted to leave it at that.\n\nA few years later while riding my bike Trent ran me over with his car and fled the scene. Dead again, but not for the last time. Would you believe I soul-jumped again? A new face, new part of town, but still alive. \n\nFrom then on I was hunted by Trent. I still don\u2019t know how he always tracked me down. It\u2019s like when I died a piece of my soul got wedged into his, and he could always find me. Sometimes I\u2019d make it a few months, sometimes he\u2019d kill me twice in a week. It went on for years.\n\nOne day I woke up in a room that looked familiar, holding a pillow over someone\u2019s face. When I pulled the pillow away I saw the last body I was inhabiting. \n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the old me,\u201d I walked to the nearest mirror and Trent was looking back at me. I had finally jumped into his body and kicked him out.\n\nI smiled into the mirror and said, \u201cI told you I always win.\u201d","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673894127.0,"comments":[{"author":"r007r","text":" But now he\u2019s a serial killer\u2026","upvotes":90,"created_utc":1673904513.0},{"author":"crazy_nurse_89","text":"I loved the plot!

All I knew about him was that he was a biologist for the government and worked on medical cures. But as I flicked through the pages, my excitement turned to shock as I reached the final entry - a suicide note. In it, my granddad wrote about feeling guilty for his involvement with an organization called SS Nightshade. My heart sank as I read his final words. As I put the journal down, I noticed a letter lying next to it. It was addressed to my granddad and written by a journalist, asking for a comment on an article before it was published. The letter only added to the mystery and confusion surrounding my granddad's past.\n\nThe contents of the letter are as follows:\n\nIt was the year 1931, and the SS Nightshade was undergoing secret government experiments in London. Onlookers claimed to have witnessed an eerie green-blue glow that seemed to envelop the ship as her generators began to hum. In an instant, the Nightshade vanished without a trace.\n\nDays passed and the ship was spotted in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, but before any investigation could take place, it disappeared once more, reappearing back in London. The crew, however, were not the same men who had set sail. Some had gone mad, others had fallen ill with mysterious ailments, and some were said to have been fused to the ship, their limbs melded with the metal, still alive, but trapped in a living nightmare.\n\nThe government, in their infinite wisdom, sought to cover up the incident, classifying all documents pertaining to the Nightshade as top secret. But rumors and legends of the cursed ship and its ill-fated crew spread, causing fear and paranoia amongst those who knew of the experiments. It is said that on certain nights, a ghostly green-blue glow can still be seen surrounding the Nightshade, a haunting reminder of the horrors that occurred aboard her decks, a chilling reminder of the dangers of playing God.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673958603.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Don't look.","author":"rektcitybtch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10e87oo\/dont_look\/","text":"The man walked down the dimly lit alleyway, the only source of light coming from a flickering streetlamp at the end.

It told him that if anyone were to see the creature on his back, they would be cursed as well, and the creature would rip the spine from his body, transferring the curse once again.\n\nThe man tried to shake the creature off, but it was impossible to remove. He was trapped, and so would be anyone who came into contact with him.\n\nThe man's days were filled with fear and paranoia as he struggled to avoid contact with others. He became a hermit, living in the shadows and hiding from the world. But it was only a matter of time before someone saw the creature on his back, and the curse was passed on once again.\n\nThe man knew that there was no escape from the curse. It would continue to spread, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake. And as the creature whispered in his ear, promising him a fate worse than death, he knew that there was nothing he could do to stop it.\n\nThe man, now old and alone, spends his days sitting in a dark corner of an abandoned building, waiting for the end to come. Finally as the creature rips the spine from his body, transferring the curse once again, to you.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673948349.0,"comments":[{"author":"Arhcheh","text":"Is that a fkcn jojo reference","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1674120331.0}]},{"title":"My cheating husband let his new woman live with us","author":"Peachyakiyama","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10dt4fa\/my_cheating_husband_let_his_new_woman_live_with_us\/","text":"I couldn\u2019t believe it.

I\u2019m already filing for divorce.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse? The girl, Marlene, has nowhere to go (and neither do I), so he let her stay in the house with us.\n\nMarlene\u2019s a BITCH. She gives me an attitude for EVERYTHING and made me her little maid. \u201cKarina do this, Karina do that\u201d it makes me want to smash her stupid little perfect head against the table. Grant doesn\u2019t seem to care at all, but rather cares more for her and treats her so much better than he treated me. It\u2019s not fucking fair.\n\nA few days ago, Marlene found out she\u2019s pregnant. You guessed it, with Grant\u2019s baby. I was fuming, but I stayed in my room and let them celebrate since it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nLater that day, Marlene \u201cordered\u201d me to bake a cake for them to celebrate. Crying tears of anger as I was making the batter, I remembered my friend giving me a bottle of poison that resembled and tasted like vanilla extract. I quickly added a couple drops of it and finally popped it in the oven.\n\n\u201cAlright, it\u2019s ready!!\u201d I called out to them, trying to sound enthusiastic as possible despite fuming, I set the cake on the table while Grant and Marlene sat down. \u201cWhy thank you, Karina\u201d Marlene said while giving me a shit-eating smirk. It made me want to smack the fuck out of her even more. I grabbed a slice to avoid suspicion, constantly reminding myself to not take a bite despite the delicious smell. \n\nAfter a while, Marlene began to choke. Her hands reached for her neck as she began to gasp for air. I tried not to smile as she stopped moving. I know it would affect her unborn child, but I didn\u2019t care. I wanted her out of my house, and if telling her won\u2019t do that, then I\u2019ll have to put a little more extra force.\n\nGrant was trying desperately to save Marlene.

I could tell since there was no more pulse or movement. I smiled to myself, later wondering what else to do since I was finally free.

Though it's not like you can do anything, and it's just killing me to keep this within me. Sharing it will give me so much satisfaction. So here I go.\n\nI run an abortion clinic in secret. It's an illegal practice, so it's not like I can go and advertise it. Knowledge of my practice is spread by word, from the previous desperate to the current desperate.\n\nIn public I always disavow it. That's the trick. People think I am extremely against it, that I am extremely Christian. People almost call me holy, can you believe that, the irony? I say the regular stuff, that it's wrong, that it's murder, that it's a gore-full, filthy act. All of that nonsense.\n\nThe thing with abortion is that almost all people who want it are going to go through with it despite the law. The only thing you really can impact is how they go about it. Do they need to put their trust in the hands of their community, or, in the hands of strangers like me? *He-hi-HA!*\n\nLet me tell you, it's a very bad idea to place your trust in me. I don't look suspicious. I'm not old, ugly, or strange. You could spend a whole day with me and walk away thinking that I am a good, average lad. That can't be less true. Whilst we're talking, whilst you see my lips form into a smile, and my caring eyes shining on you, thoughts of how I could inflict you with the most amount of pain possible are shooting through my head.\n\nSo it's really a godsend when *desperate* people come to me for *help. Hahahahahaha.* They willingly sedate themselves in the privacy of my own apartment. Stupid, silly, humans.\n\nHere's the thing though. I do what they ask for. If I didn't, they would stop coming. I'd rather hurt a bunch of people than a few. So, whilst they're sedated, I perform the abortion, but here's the thing. I do not kill the fetus. I repeat. I do not kill the fetus.\n\nAnd then it's done. The lady walks away thanking me, in tears and filled with gratitude. They don't know that their soon-to-be baby is still alive. And that's the thing. Nobody does. Here I have a potential human that nobody knows about, that nobody *cares* for, and that I can do whatever I want to.\n\n*Hahahahahahahaahah.*\n\nIt's so much potential. I can do whatever I want with it, and it differs, really what my mind wants to do at the moment. With one, I fed and cared for it until it was three years old. Then, I shoved it into the oven and slowly raised the temperature.\n\nWith another, I kept it locked up in a secret cellar beneath my house, where I regularly go to torture it.  So much fun.

One shot was all it took and all your fears of eternal slumber would be but a distant memory. \n\nOf course, like most things, the wealthy and influential received it before everyone else but after a few years, a new and more affordable version was to be shipped to the public. What we didn't know at the time was that a cure for death did not mean a cure for cancer, dementia, or for any other incurable disease you could think of. What it mostly meant was that although you couldn't die, if you weren't particularly healthy you'd essentially be in pain forever and for that, there was no remedy. \n\nHowever recently, scientists have developed a drug that would numb any kind of pain. The best part, they made it affordable right away. In hindsight, we all should've known that this was just a way for the pharmaceutical industry to maximize its profits. Oh, and what profits they made people couldn't get enough of this magic drug. Most people, including me. You see, pain is just your body's way of warning you and without that, I failed to feel the tingles. my body was screaming to get help and by then it was too late I woke up one morning a fucking vegetable. \n\nNowadays, I spend most of my time staring at the white ceiling of the hospital I am currently in and have been for the last 30 years.

The garden is blanketed in snow, and icicles hang from the eaves. Inside, the house is warm and cosy, with roaring fires in the hearths and heavy drapes covering the windows. The decor is opulent, with plush furnishings and ornate mouldings adorning the rooms. Despite the harsh winter weather outside, the inhabitants of the manor house are comfortable and well-protected from the elements.\n\nThe family had gathered for Christmas dinner, one year after the death of their beloved grandmother.

I waved, politely gesturing to get her attention.\n\nThe woman smiled sweetly at me, and gave me a little wave back as if to say \"everything's OK\".\n\nI'm not someone who likes to interfere, so I turned back to my manga, suppressing my lingering sense of unease which seemed to tingle with tiny insect footsteps slowly along my spine.\n\nI heard a soft \"thud, thud, thud\" and looked up to see a little trickle of blood dripping from the woman's right ear. I stood up, but this seemed to startle her, as she stood suddenly too, no longer laughing. Now she looked afraid. The white pages of her book became saturated with spreading red stains.\n\nI looked up and down the train carriage but saw nobody else. I looked across at the woman who met my gaze. Both her ears now were oozing with a thick crimson treacle. Running on pure instinct, I reached up and yanked the train's emergency brake.\n\nThe almighty screech of the train's wheels seemed to split my soul in two. I literally could see four hands in front of me, instead of two, as if I were undergoing mitosis. I screamed like Axl Rose dueting with Brian Johnson.\n\nAnd I screamed like a nuclear blast wind when I saw, from the corners of my eyes, some wriggling little things falling from each of my bleeding ears, before writhing, apparently in agony, on the ground. I couldn't look; I shut my eyes and curled up, convulsing.\n\nA door opened, and I heard two train guards sprinting simultaneously toward me. \"Whats going on, buddy?\" They said, in unison, like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, strange smiles stretching their lips.\n\nUnable to speak anything but gibberish, I looked down to the floor to see nothing of the strange slugs, just four small splodges of gloopy blood mixed with weird mushy matter. \n\nI heard the familiar \"drip drip drip\" as drops fell from each of the train guards' ears.\n\nMy broken brain couldn't process much more than forming a pointing gesture with my index fingers, toward the two identical women sitting directly opposite, both pointing straight back at the pair of us, with slugs deftly disappearing back inside each of their ears.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673874395.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":">I screamed like Axl Rose dueting with Brian Johnson.\n\nAnd, that day, OP realised not even sheer panic could dampen their flair for killer turns of phrase. \n\nAlso, I agree with the commenter above.

A flow of chilled sea water sent right up my nose causing me to choke for a second as icy needles started digging into my exposed skin. The waters here can get well below freezing and from the looks of it we were taking in a lot.\n\nWe were part of a research mission sent out to the arctic to gather information on whale migration patterns. The trip had been mostly uneventful thus far. Most nights at sea are. A gentle rock you've got to get used to in your legs but after that it's just dealing with all the empty time. The night before we'd run into a bit of unfavorable weather but it wasn't considered anything serious by our captain. He paid it no mind so we followed his lead.\n\nI jumped out of bed and instantly felt the cold shock through my legs and all throughout my body as they submerged into the foot of water swishing around the floor of my cabin. I was bunked much lower in the ship. By choice as I greatly appreciated my privacy. There was time to make my escape but not much. Things move quickly once a ship starts taking on water. Blink and you'll be trapped left to drown and your body never to be found. I got dressed, put on a life vest, grabbed what I didn't want to leave behind and made for the hallway.\n\nThe sound of the ocean rushing in to fill our ship was deafening. Whatever had opened us up to the sea had done it wide. The darkness of the underbelly of our ship became apparent when the dim lights started to fade as our power was compromised. I ran in the opposite direction of the flood. Calling for help the whole way along but never any response. Strange thing that all of the cabins were open as if an evacuation had already occured. They wouldn't have left me behind, would they.\n\nI made it up to the upper deck greeted with a strong gust of negative temperature wind. Up there I set my eyes on a horrifying sight. All of the safety rafts were still on board yet everyone was gone. No signs of a struggle so it could only mean one thing. I frantically got to running from rail to rail and looking outward. Hoping for a sign and finally on the other side of the ship I saw it. In the distance I could make out a visual of another ship. Presumably the one that had come to pick up everyone else when things went south. The one that wouldn't be returning. They'd left me behind, by accident most likely but still. The ocean was claiming the decks where I was standing now. Wouldn't be long before we were completely under. I'd be floating aimlessly destined to freeze in a raft. Waiting just hoping they'd realize their mistake and come back for me.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1673893343.0,"comments":[{"author":"Banana_Mommy","text":"A very nice story.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1673934674.0}]},{"title":"Sometimes You Need To Be Hard On The People Who Won't Listen","author":"HeadOfSpectre","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10cwqar\/sometimes_you_need_to_be_hard_on_the_people_who\/","text":"   \"What did I tell you about that?\"\n\nWHACK.\n\nThe sight of it made me flinch.

When we couldn't get formal approval for a consent form, we sought out for people who informally consented to read psychologically distressing information. Nobody died, except by natural causes or suicide. Rest assured, in any case of casualty, they or their families were well compensated. If you experience unusual symptoms as a result of a post by a new account here, and that post and account have been deleted, contact us, and we can provide you with financial compensation. We simply sought to determine the border of safety.\n\nOur research project is no longer underfunded. We no longer receive problems with ethics boards. We have found ways to prove it is safe. We can now proceed to the main goal.\n\nYou should expect to see news stories get less frightening, the world less scary. Even retroactively, past events should seem more like statistics than real life. And those are relatively minor, the present events were always the main goal. After all, it just kept on getting worse. We can isolate these factors and counter them, now. You should find it's easy to ignore what's happening on other continents and go on with your day. Even as our experiments are finishing being rolled out to the public, you should be able to focus more on what's happening to close to you, to your friends, family, and yourself, and not to the world at large.\n\nIf you think we are deserving of punishment for having affected your minds like this, rest assured, I am going into a mental hospital once this is done. I saw it all, and did not forget. I can still see it. I never read any of the memetic agents we deployed. I read the books prior to our project, and the numbers of casualties now, photographs they don't publish, but not the printed news. I can infer what's going on. I don't want to live in a world like this, no matter how far away it's happening. That's enough for me to know I should seek help.\n\nI thought to tell you this because you are the kind of people who seek out the worst horror. You can. It's not censored. Nothing is.

For once, this is the full truth, not a memetic agent, our armed forces are the best in the world. The operation cut the amount we have to spend on psychiatry ten times. We can finally ignore. We can continue in our lives and still feel that the world is getting better. And for our lifetime, and what we now consider our world, it just might.

A bedroom, a control room for if things go wrong. They haven\u2019t gone wrong yet. \n\nThe main bulk is more so a small warehouse. Shelves of records, photographs, computer banks, art, machinery. The ephemera of a dying species. \n\nIt\u2019s a time capsule. Or a coffin. \n\nI sit, and I stare, and I listen to Mozart\u2019s *Lacrimosa* while reading the Christian bible for the third time.

Replay the messages from Earth, try to make sense of the new geopolitical complications, ecological disasters. \n\nThen they stopped coming through, and I was left with my thoughts, and Bach\u2019s *Cello Suite.* \n\nI stop going into the pod. Its foul, unnatural, and besides, I want to age. I want to live, to laugh, to love. But they took that from me. \n\nSacrificed my life for what, the legacy of the species? \n\nTo hell with that.

I suffocate myself, poison myself, each time awakening, undamaged, unspoilt. \n\nFine. If I am to escape hell, I must burn it down.\n\nBeethoven\u2019s *Symphony No. 5* accompanies me as I tare away at the control panel, till that too cuts out. The siren starts to flash.

He couldn\u2019t stomach losing any more of his beloved alpaca Herd.\n\n\u201cWhat you describe, hijo mio, is not a wolf or coyote. It is the cursed Pishtaco that murders your doomed Herd!  The village has always known of the Pishtaco\u2019s existence.  The Repeated legends always provide us the truth. The Pishtaco\u2019s lust for the creatures\u2019 fat has become insatiable. It now hides among the village disguised as a human!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do then to stop it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is point where the danger facing you grows stronger. You must travel to Salar de Uyuni. The otherworldly Salt Flats. You must recite a quick prayer to the sacred, reflective ground. In the Gran Espejo, the mirror-like surface a Red face will be revealed. It will reveal the identity of your monster. You must stop it now before it\u2019s taste for delicious fat shifts to the villagers!\u201d\n\n\\--\n\nAdelio made the dangerous journey to Salar de Uyuni within three arduous days. The beauty of this place truly breath-taking. The endless azure sky simply doubled. A rare window that gazed directly into Heaven. \n\nA short, splashy walk into the bright sunny abyss and Adelio was ready. He took out the paper with the prayer and Repeated it three times with his eyes closed. He opened his eyes and then gazed into the ground, or was it the sky? \n\n\u201cI ask you now, before the Heavens and Earth, what am I do? Who are you, who are you, who are you?\u201d\n\nAll Adelio saw though was his own stunned face. Not just one face though, thousands upon thousands of them, Cascading and dotting the ground and the sky. They taunted him in sync with their malicious instructions.\n\n\u201cS\u00edganos, follow us, you mindless, hungry worm!\u201d\n\nAdelio panicked and ran. His feet almost gliding upon the wet, shiny surface. The rippling wakes in the shallow saline water that he made provided him with a temporary illusion of agency.  \n\nNot knowing what else to do, he followed the chorus of taunting faces to a distant point in the confusing horizon. The ceaseless echoing voices now his one and only Truth.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673851753.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I am So Happy","author":"1000andonenites","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10ckpha\/i_am_so_happy\/","text":" \n\nThe chicken soup looked and smelled delicious. I looked proudly at the fine golden broth with small savoury chunks of vegetables and chicken bubbling around. Good thing my last ingredient wouldn\u2019t alter the taste or texture of the soup. \n\nI carefully ladled a small bowl for myself and set it aside. After all I am already madly in love with my darling Farid, I have no need for love potions.\n\nI took out the small blue bottle and poured a generous spoonful into the soup.\n\nTechnically, this wasn\u2019t a traditional love potion- the kind that has been circulating since humans discovered love.

I am nothing if not a good housewife.\n\nOops- maybe that was a tad too much. Nevermind, cooking is not an exact science, after all. I stirred the soup, feeling excitement bubble inside me. \n\nI heard Farid coughing from the couch. He is a bit better now, this morning he moved to the couch from his bed where he had been confined to for almost three weeks with this terrible flu. I ladled soup for him into a gorgeous patterned ceramic bowl- one of his mother\u2019s from the old country, I believe, and poured some glossy amber tea into a delicate gleaming narrow-waisted glass cup. I cut up the perfectly-browned slice of toast, and placed them on a small china platter I had picked up at a garage sale, decorated with deep pink roses and sapphire-blue peacocks.\n\nOh God I am so happy. \n\nWhat a cliche. How could it be that I, an accomplished, educated woman, am the happiest I have ever been in my life taking care of my sick boyfriend?\n\nI carried the tray into the living room, where poor Farid was blowing his nose into the tenth  crumpled tissue paper. \u201cLook sweetheart what I have for you.

Never. In fact, I think he may have been screwing himself up to dump me. Me! \n\nAs my love-soup coursed through his veins, he smiled at me, and then overcome by flu and a bout of dizziness, leaned heavily back on the couch. \u201cOh poor baby\u201d I murmured. \u201cTake it easy, maybe you should go back to bed my love?\u2019 and I stroked his feverish beloved face.\n\nWell, he\u2019s not going anywhere now.

And if they are judged to lack \"empathy\", they are arrested and taken away to a large, white house, where people in white coats will will ask you trivial questions about your parents. If you do not respond to their questions in a satisfactory manner, you will get group therapy. If this also does not work, electroshocks.\n\nThis happened to me.

Our dream home was built on the remains of a serial killer's burial ground. He had buried his victims in the backyard, and we were living on top of them. \n\n We tried to leave, but it was too late. Every night, we were plagued by nightmares and visions of the killer and his victims. The ghostly presence in the house grew stronger and more aggressive.

At the other end is worthless, naught but the forgotten in the snow. \n\nIn the middle there is comfort if you can find the resolve to persist\u2013 but it\u2019s hard, at times. I really couldn\u2019t resist. \n\nShe fell me with an arrow, obsidian to my neck, and now I watch with wonder\u2013\n\nDid you see that? What secrets do these shadows hold? \n\nWhat is this place?! Did you feel that shiver down your spine? Are you the hunter or the hunted or do we dance this dance eternal, devoted and divine.\n\nCat and mouse, the wild hunt, rend from me your truth. The hunter\u2019s light, full and bright, it is my pleasure to be of use. \n\nI did not mean to shout so loud the heavens might take notice, but shout I did to any and all and no one in particular\u2013\n\nStar light, star bright, it\u2019s not on you I wish tonight. This little witch has caught my sight, and though not with words and perhaps not aloud, I wish I may, I wish I might. \n\nI sang it from my soul, she etched it into my bones, but my dear I fear that wishes have a price. \n\nWhat\u2019s out there listening as we cast our wishes to the well? These shadows are new and strange, more insidious than before, but I would contest that there is hope. A glimmer, a clear spark.\n\nI can see you out there, I can feel your call. \n\nWould you have this dance with me? Put your hand in mine. We will dazzle in the darkness, devoted and divine.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673806787.0,"comments":[{"author":"shifty_mcG33","text":"I'm positive I missed the point, but the writing style was wonderful!

We\u2019d been crossing a mountain pass in the early days of winter. It could be risky\u2014I was aware of that\u2014but I believed we could make it across safely. Besides, given that we\u2019d worn out our welcome in the last little hamlet we\u2019d called home, we both felt it worth the risk.\n\nI could see a storm approaching from the north, ominous and dark. We\u2019d gone too far to turn back, though, and honestly, going back wasn\u2019t an option, so we pushed on.\n\nThe storm hit with a fury when we were within a hundred yards of the apex. Strong, biting winds and an onslaught of snow, snow so thick you literally couldn\u2019t see your hand in front of your face. There was but one thing to do\u2014build a shelter from the snow and ride it out. That\u2019s what we did.\n\nThe space we fashioned was small but comfortable. I\u2019d left a hole for egress on the side away from the storm, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was completely covered with powder in an hour, and soon thereafter the snow had gathered above and around us sufficiently to block out every last drop of light. Still, for the moment we were safe, and we were together.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much time had passed\u2014maybe a day, maybe less\u2014when I first tried to excavate us from our little cocoon. I dug at the snow for hours to no avail, until Erisha convinced me to return to her side. We slept.\n\nI awakened with a start sometime later and once again felt motivated to dig. I dug . . . and I dug . . . and I clawed at the snow, which had begun changing to sheets of ice. Obviously I had no idea how deep we were, but something about our tomb felt immense . . . permanent. Once again Erisha called me to her, and somewhere in the darkness we seemed to reconcile ourselves with both our mounting hunger and our fate. We tried unsuccessfully to make love. Instead, we simply held each other in a tender embrace, and somewhere in our eternal night we fell asleep.\n\nCuriously, I have finally awakened. Erisha is still sleeping in my arms, but I\u2019ll wake her soon. What I think roused *me* was the light. We\u2019ve long since been completely entombed in ice, but above me there is a definite glow. Something has obviously happened in the world that will ultimately release us from our icy grave. And not a moment too soon . . . I\u2019m starving. I wonder if there are still people in that little hamlet we fled from so long ago. No doubt stories of us and our \u201cescapades\u201d have long since died. For stories become tales, and tales become legends, and legends are replaced by other legends.\n\nErisha and I have been stuck in the ice for near ten thousand years. Long enough, I\u2019d say.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673769393.0,"comments":[{"author":"Fresh_Rabbit6067","text":"More","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1673825576.0}]},{"title":"A Stormy Night","author":"Skullslasher","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10clt81\/a_stormy_night\/","text":"It was a dark and stormy night, and I was all alone in my old, creaky house.

I froze, unable to move or even scream. And then, a voice whispered in my ear, \"You should have never come here.\"\n\nI don't know how long I stood there, paralyzed with fear.

He often disappears for days at a time without notice and leaves me without a reading companion. For a person who claimed to love books as much as he did, I never did see him with a book in his hands. \n\nHes an odd character, often interspersing his stories with long ramblings about many things like \"good-for-nothin peoples\" and \"pigs in politics\". But i dont really mind, because he kept me entertained even with his ramblings. \n\nA bad thing about Mr. Wilson is that he uses a lot of no-no words while he talks. I cant really say what they are or what they mean, but my parents told me to never say those words until im a **teenager**. I dont think i will ever say them because my parents say that its a sign of \"stupitipy\" or something. \n\nAnd my favorite thing about him is the fact that hes a wizard whos over a thousand years old (a secret he told only me). He constantly drinks from his magic flask which gives him more life. \n\nHe suffers from an ancient ailment called \"alko'olisum\" which I heard his friend talking to him about. \n\nIm only 10 years old, but I'm sad he didn't tell me, his best friend, that his potion caused him this ailment. He later told me that it felt like rats running around his head with their tiny feet and chittering. \n\nI had heard my father talk about his tube of cream that killed rats so i decided to surprise Mr. Wilson. One day, when he wasn't looking, i put some of the cream I took into his flask. \n\nHe was so excited after drinking it that he danced around while lying on the floor. \n\nI'm waiting to hear his response, but he's sleeping on the floor right now.

He observes her from a distance, studying her and familiarizing himself with her habits. Though he has never met Sarah, he is drawn to her by an inexplicable attraction, particularly by the glow that surrounds her, a radiance that seems to emanate from within. Her aura is beautiful, her nature is pure. A far cry from his own.\n\nThroughout his life, Giovanni has committed countless acts of violence, often as a result of his blinding and all-consuming temper. Early on, he recognized a deep pleasure in the power and control that comes with it. However, he often feels himself slipping and becoming more detached from his humanity each time he gives into his impulses. He wonders if there's a point of no return. If he continues down this path, will he become a true monster? Does it even matter? He contemplates the fact that each act of violence will make it harder for him to return to the person he once was, if that is even possible. \n\nHe continues to follow Sarah, observing her every move. But as he watches, he is now feeling torn as he debates whether or not to turn out her distinctive glow. He hungers to take a life, to feel the thrill and satisfaction. He can almost taste it in his mouth, the excitement of snuffing out an existence. He wonders what Sarah would look like with her throat cut open; how she would sound as she takes her last bloody gurgle of a breath.\n\nBut still, as he watches, he is envious of her carefree and innocent nature.

No, I was born in the deep, darkest corners of your nightmares, the ones you fear staring at you back in the dark.\n\nA few nights ago I was assigned to the house of a little girl. I had read her file beforehand. Age 7, no siblings, lived alone with her father and no other. Her name was Molly. Terrified of thunder.\n\nEasy enough. Send her packing and I *might* get a pay rise.\n\nI got into position Tuesday night. Slithering in through her window and under her bed. Silent as a snake. I licked the darkness. I couldn\u2019t wait for bedtime.\n\nThe door creaked open and light snaked into the room. I heard a timid, \u201cGoodnight Papa,\u201d followed by an angry roar that shook me to my gelatinous bones.\n\nMolly climbed into bed, and I felt her frightened heart beating sixty times faster than a mouse\u2019s.

Her eyes were broken. Hollow. It had seen all the horrors of the world and could not stand for more.\n\n*Oh god.*\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d I started and then broke down in tears. In my years being in the business I have never seen a child like this. I could hear the father in the next room.

Right outside her room. \n\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d \n\nThe door flew off the hinges, revealing the real monster at the door. He snapped around, found me and screamed again.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d\n\nMolly shrank back against her bed. I swallowed, but I was not scared.\n\nI rose up to face him. The darkness leapt around me and fire burned into my eyes. I hissed, swaying, glared into his soul. The man swallowed. His face paled. His courage wilted.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt this girl,\u201dI told him. \u201cNot any more.\u201d\n\nThen I took her by the hand and sank back into the nightmares where I belonged and where she will always be safe. \n\nWith me.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673696646.0,"comments":[{"author":"Nykeilah","text":"brb CRYING\n\nWhat a gorgeous story, a wholesome ending","upvotes":51,"created_utc":1673706798.0},{"author":"EminentBadge60","text":"I want MORE!","upvotes":47,"created_utc":1673713650.0},{"author":"Mrs_Weaver","text":"Really good read.

I had to explain this to Annie, my close friend, after I made the mistake of mentioning this little linguistic quirk to her. \u201cThat\u2019s so weird!\u201d she exclaimed, \"Does he always talk to you like that? Like, \u2018she\u2019s making pasta- can she add pepper to the sauce?\u2019 \u201c\n\nI frowned \u201cOf course not! He talks normally - mostly- only when\u201d I couldn\u2019t help giggling \u201c-um, you know, when we\u2019re going to bed.\u201d Annie made rude barfy noises, and I left soon after- I wanted to be with Paul, I was missing him so much, even though I had been with him only a couple of hours ago.\n\nAnd he felt the same way. \"There she is, my lovely!\u201d he exclaimed delightedly on seeing me- but maybe my conversation with Annie had rattled me- was I imagining that he glanced to his side, where there was no-one, before descending on me all hugs and kisses.\n\nMy slight unease vanished as I melted into the pleasure of being with him, and when he murmured \u201cOh I missed her so much! Where has my sweetheart been all this time!\u201d I only felt love and joy at being so desired.\n\nWhat did Annie know about love anyway- she had never had a real relationship in her life.\n\nShortly after that I caught the flu that\u2019s going around, and was bedridden with a high temperature. I couldn\u2019t see Paul.\n\n\u201cI miss my sweetheart so much! I have to see her!\u201d he texted on the third day, and even though I was still feverish, I felt well enough to ask him to come over for a brief visit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s my poor baby!\u201d he said upon seeing me, flushed with fever in bed. He turned to a strange man who had followed him in. \u201cLook at her!\u201d\n\nThe man looked at me with blank eyes, and my heart skipped a beat.\n\nPaul came close for an embrace, but I shrank away. \u201cYou\u2019ll get sick\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I want to hug my sweetheart!\u201d he said. He bent over my bed and drew me close. Over his shoulder, I could see his friend, now fully visible to me in the throes of fever, looking down at us expressionlessly, and I knew he had been there all the time.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673706608.0,"comments":[{"author":"SoftieQwQ","text":"Can someone explain TvT","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1673722956.0},{"author":null,"text":"[deleted]","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1673725230.0},{"author":"exceptionalcupcake","text":"My boyfriend actually talks like this to me so.. this story got me lol.

I was sure that I did everything correctly and so I went back to that post, and it had more instructions on what to do if it fails. \n\nIf crying in front of my wife with a dead rabbit in my arms wouldn't work, then I would have to cry in front of her with her dead parents in my arms.

One that makes your muscles tweak and twitch, a signal for \u2018Please, flick this nuisance away!\u2019 But don't. Stay your hand. Do not move.\n\nSoon, it will grow, but to no more than a touch. The fairest of a finger dancing ever so gently. More enticing to the senses than before. Arguably, even pleasurable and as it whirls in circles, pulses of tingles will soothe your skin and scalp. Sleep may call to you. A sound so quiet, you believe you imagine it, till it murmurs again. Just off to your side. Maybe the left, maybe the right. It whispers from the path of your deepest wishes. Do not listen.\n\nStay still and you will find that the press is now more. Not a bother, not a touch. It is unambiguously a prick. One that will cause anxiety to swell within you and a worry to deepen in your chest, that whatever it is, will run you through. However, calm yourself.\n\nBy now, sounds from your most wanted dreams will urge you. \u2018Come with me!\u2019 A familiar voice calls. One you know but cannot place.

You'd be blameless to have opened your eyes by now, but a fool, nonetheless.\n\nBack and forth, moving at their own pace. You will feel them scrape and scrawl on your very bones. Etching a name. Each needle a letter. Then one by one, they will begin to sear. Until the foulest stench of your flesh is all you can breathe.\n\nThen will come many voices but truly, there is only one you hear. Your own, and it will brandish your insecurities and fears with cheerful abandon. While a distant rumble makes everything shake. It happens once. Then twice. And again.

The roof was missing tiles, and sunflowers hid the gaps in the fences. You often drove the last half an hour without seeing another car. I never understood why they bought this specific place, and chose to leave their leafy English townhouse for somewhere so ramshackle. \n\nWhatever the reason, their decision was a jackpot win for my parents. Both worked as translators, and fancied weekend trips to Paris at least twice a year. Trips where I was not trailing behind them, moaning about long walks. This move provided them with free childcare under the guise of family bonding. So off I went to the middle of Normandy to the house with missing tiles. \n\nThis was no bother for me. Rules at the cottage had a pleasant vagueness. My grandparents allowed me to eat chocolate from the morning onwards, and play in the garden without supervision. Their only strict command was to head back inside when night fell.\n\nI challenged this once, and both insisted the darkness was different in the countryside. They said it was easy to get lost once the sun went down. That without proper streetlights even the most sensible person was a few steps from going missing. \n\nThe best part was they let me stay up late. Or rather, they went to bed without checking I had done the same. This allowed me to burn through book after book in the spare bedroom I called a temporary home. The rug on the floor was so thick and cosy. A large image of a crescent moon decorated the fibres, detailed with one sleepy eye and a smile. \n\nOften the birds had started singing before I slipped away. \n\nThese extra hours of consciousness mounted up after a few days. Sometimes I had to haul myself to bed from the floor without the energy to clean my teeth or put on pyjamas. One night I failed to make even this one foot climb to underneath the duvet, and curled like a dog upon on that gorgeous soft rug. \n\nA circle within a circle. I reckon that was the problem. For when I woke up, the moon-faced men stood above me in their navy blue overalls. They spoke what I knew was French, even if the actual translation was beyond my grasp. \n\nIt was so sad when my grandparents died last month. My parents have tried to be positive, and said we could try and keep the cottage. Now I was older, I could even stay there by myself.  \n\nBut they cannot confirm if the moon rug is still on the floor of the spare room.

It made sense, she was always so uncertain after our parents died, so nervous. We had similar jobs (hers at a lower pay, of course), I set her up with her husband, he was an employee at my husband\u2019s company. We planned to go through motherhood together too. That\u2019s where things began to fall apart. Conception was easy enough for both of us, but my pregnancy was horrible, while Jessica sailed through hers like a glowing Madonna. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had our babies within weeks of each other, with my daughter, Amelia born first.

Beautiful, plump cheeks and a shock of adorable strawberry-blonde hair. She was gorgeous, good-natured and happy.

Jessica had the audacity to start sharing parenting tips, motherhood seemed to instill this *confidence* she didn\u2019t have before. It messed with the order of things, with *our* order.

I calmed her down easily, I\u2019m pretty convincing, when I need to be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJessica left for the night and my husband returned soon after from his errand. We shut Amelia up in her room where her wails wouldn\u2019t bother us, and turned our attention to Sophia. She happily cooed at us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d My husband asked nervously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt did once before.\u201d I smiled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe theatrics the next morning were such a chore. Police cars and wailing, it was quite the scene. Jessica and her husband were dead, apparently a squirrel had built a nest in their furnace pipe. You\u2019d think after what happened to our parents they\u2019d have detectors. It was a good thing Sophia was with us for the night. Then came the uncomfortable question about what to do with her. My husband and I were listed as her godparents, but we just didn\u2019t feel up to the task. With heavy hearts, we let the foster system take over. It was for the best. The social worker came to collect Sophia the next morning, as Amelia slept peacefully in her carrier. I watched as the worker crammed a hat on Sophia's bald head as she wailed. I shut the door behind them and turned back to my small peaceful girl, smiling as I gently brushed a lock of strawberry-blonde hair off her forehead.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673656007.0,"comments":[{"author":"Own_Magazine_7410","text":"Amelia said that she coming for y'all since y'all never read The Ugly Duckling...","upvotes":217,"created_utc":1673661185.0},{"author":"danielleshorts","text":"That's just wrong.

It wasn\u2019t so much the truck itself that bothered her, it was the fact that *nobody seemed to be home.*\n\nNo school buses ferrying children, no parents returning from work, not even a mailman.\n\nAngeline turned it over in her head, fighting the nagging urge that felt less taboo the longer she thought about it. After taking turns looking between the rumbling truck and the wall clock that ticked away\u2026 she found herself doing the only thing that made sense.\n\nShe took out the garbage.\n\nThe bag in the kitchen was hardly full, but she tied off the bag anyway. She slipped on crocs and opened the front door, letting in the sound of the worn out exhaust. The street looked more deserted now that she was outside, and the impulse to close the door and retreat begged at the back of her mind.\n\nDespite her mental logic she closed the door and made her way to the street, the rhythmic slapping of crocs echoing her determination over the grass. The thing looked rougher up close, peeling paint and cancerous rust riddling holes throughout the structure. \n\n*It was only a garbage truck.*\n\n*There isn\u2019t even anyone driving it.*\n\n*It doesn\u2019t even smell.*\n\n*Nothing to be scared of.*\n\nThese thoughts drove Angeline on as she marched towards the truck, eager to prove to herself that she could handle this menial task. Hefting the bag to lob it in, Angeline approached the loader, and stopped.\n\nDozens of swollen black bags filled the ass end of the truck, each bag stuffed to the point of bursting. She looked not at the mound but underneath it, puzzle pieces in the plastic forcing themselves together in her mind.\n\nThe vibrant pattern of a crocheted sweater.\n\nA cold outstretched hand.\n\nAn exposed half-face.\n\nThe details were so loud, she didn\u2019t hear the boots thumping behind her.\n\nHeavy hands grabbed her shoulders and shoved, pressing her into the mound of swollen plastic. Before she could resist, more bags toppled over her, heavy grunts followed by burying weight.\n\nBehind her the loader compacted, forcing her into the mound of clammy bags. She kicked and screamed but the bags silenced her, beckoning with clammy feet and hands behind the film as it consumed her.\n\nScreaming against the cold dark, Angeline felt the truck pulling away.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673646154.0,"comments":[{"author":"psyopticnerve","text":"Smh at all that organic material being thrown out.

She used to eat the little chips of paint; they had a sweet taste if she held them in her mouth long enough. But her mommy had told her to not eat the chips because they were bad for her, so she\u2019d stopped eating them. Still, that thought alone was enough to make her sad.\n\n\u201cDo you not like the cartoon?\u201d\n\nThe woman had come into the room without her noticing. She\u2019d taken off her shoes. She\u2019d been wearing high heels that made loud clicks when she walked, but she\u2019d taken them off. She\u2019d also removed all the fancy eye makeup and lipstick she\u2019d been wearing. Her mommy wore lots of eye makeup and lipstick, too, but only when she went to work and wore her little dresses. Sometimes when her mommy was happy she\u2019d put lipstick on *her*, and she\u2019d pretend she was a big girl . . .\n\n\u201cI thought all little girls liked *Sailor Moon*.\u201d\n\nThe lady was nice, but she didn\u2019t like her. She\u2019d also never seen *Sailor Moon* before, didn\u2019t know what *Sailor Moon* was.\n\nThe lady picked her up and set her on the bed, then sat beside her. Put her arm around her. Strangely, that made her feel better.\n\n\u201cDo you want to watch something else?\u201d\n\nShe looked at the television, then at the scuffed dresser beside it, then at the tattered wallpaper on the far wall. Then she shook her head.\n\n\u201cWould you like something to eat? I think I have some more of those cookies.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, though she didn\u2019t really want more cookies. It was more a reflex than anything\u2014never refuse cookies when offered because it could be a long time before they\u2019re offered again.\n\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d The woman smiled broadly, showed the several gaps where teeth used to be. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some. And a glass of milk, too.\u201d\n\nThe woman rose from the bed and started for the door. Just as she reached the threshold the doorbell to the front door rang. *Someone was there\u2014maybe it was her mommy!*\n\nThe woman closed and latched the door, just as she\u2019d done every time she\u2019d left her. She rushed to the door anyway and placed her ear against it so she could hear. Her mommy had told her not to do that because it was rude\u2014especially when she had a friend over\u2014but she couldn\u2019t help herself. She was excited . . . hopeful . . . \n\n\u201c*We agreed*,\u201d she heard the man say, \u201c*not to take less than twenty-five hundred*.\u201d\n\n\u201c*We only gave her mother five*.\u201d\n\n\u201c*But we agreed . . . right?*\u201d\n\nShe heard the front door open, and then there were new voices.\n\nShe began to weep.

Even with whole populations disillusioned, the curse lingers in the collective unconscious.\n\nI mentioned this to a classmate of mine. He\u2019s been asking me out for ages.

I\u2019ll admit, I was having a little fun with it. I\u2019d flit ahead, disappearing into the underbrush. Leaving him alone and vulnerable. He\u2019d call for me, scrambling to keep up. I had to cover my mouth to keep the giggles from giving me away. I\u2019d wait until his voice hit a frantic pitch, then step back onto the path, cheerfully asking why he was yelling.\n\nBy the fourth hour, he was too tired to complain.\n\nDusk had draped her indigo skirts over the treetops by the time we reached the clearing. I plopped down in the lush grass, patting a spot beside me. \u201cCome sit,\u201d I whispered, my eyes shining in the dark. \u201cCome keep me company.\u201d\n\nGrateful, he collapsed into the space, reaching for me. I let him, watching his pupils grow and his breathing quicken. Poor thing. I make a wicked distraction when I feel like it.\n\nHe stopped abruptly, his lips an inch from mine. The grass had grown over his legs, winding round his torso, keeping him in place. He blinked, confused, and looked down, expression turning to panic as the grass overgrew his legs.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d\n\nHe tried to reach for me, but grass encircled his arms, pulling them down. A green noose clasped his neck, forcing him onto his back in the dirt.\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d he screamed, eyes wild. \u201cHelp me!\u201d\n\nI watched as the grass covered his mouth and wound thicker about his limbs. The hill parted as the very earth swallowed him. When it was finished, there was no sign he\u2019d ever been.\n\nWith a sigh, I stood and stretched. It would be a long walk back.

To overly exaggerate things about another person can cause pressure and illusions which are impossible to achieve. It all started when our son started to brag to his friends about how rich we were and how we could afford things, to his friends. Then I had to work extra harder to maintain that image. I had to explain to our son that what he did put extra pressure on us but he didn't give a shit, so I told him that me and my wife will do the same to him. \n\nWe told other parents about how our son is a genius and will get top results in all of his exams. Our son became angry at us and now he will have to actually try harder to achieve those results. He will have to listen in class and actually learn, he will also have to sacrifice a few hobbies and free time. We had hoped that this will make him learn about over the top bragging, but it just made him more mad. Everyone thinks he is far intelligent than he actually is and now he will have to prove it. \n\nUnfortunately our son didn't learn anything and he told everyone that we were moving into a larger house in a more posh neighbourhood. I was furious with him and I couldn't believe he had done that and I had to work non stop for 2 years to make that happen, my health had to take a dip as well. I couldn't believe our son would do this and he isn't just being a teenager, but this is evil. I had to make him learn about what he did wrong and I needed to make him really learn. Then I knew what to do and I knew what I was going to brag about him, and I wasn't sure if I had to do this, because what I was going to brag about him would definitely change his life. We moved into a bigger house and into a posher neighbourhood, it was stressful and I was thinking why I was letting my sons bragging of us, actually taking affect. Could I not just ignore it or tell people the truth, this is the problem of knowing too much people, the types of judgement you will get and lonely people don't have these kinds of problems. \n\nI started bragging to other people that my son the genius, knows where the prophet Moses is actually buried. People were fascinated and I kept telling everyone and everyone kept asking our son where the most important prophet in the Abraham's books, Moses, is actually buried? My son was furious and I was pleased. Then when the devil visited my son wanting to know where Moses is buried, I haven't seen my son since.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673673435.0,"comments":[{"author":"heart-monster","text":"You've improved so much. \ud83d\udc4f I enjoy seeing your style evolve.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1673683135.0},{"author":"Stranger_at_Night","text":"This is very original! well done!","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1673706404.0},{"author":null,"text":"I wish I could explore the absurdities of human psychology as well as you do.

Not prone to allergic reactions, he scanned his hands and arms for any other marks, relieved to find none. In the bathroom he stripped down and used the mirror to check himself over, again glad to find nothing. Content the sores were likely a minor skin reaction,  he fished around his medicine cabinet for an expired tube of allergy ointment, using enough to cover the red bumps.\n\nNext morning one sore had swollen, protruding from his arm like a bubble, painful to touch, it seemed to pulsate beneath his flesh. Alarmed, Peter grabbed his keys, about to drive to the hospital when he felt something seeping down his arm. A small leak in the sore caused a trickle of yellow. Hurrying to the bathroom he held his arm over the sink and looked for a pair of scissors underneath the vanity. Despite the leaking he could still feel pressure in the swollen sore. Steadying his arm he used the point of the scissors to create a puncture. A squirt of yellow and brown slime erupted filling the bathroom with the smell of feces.\n\nPeter sighed in relief, feeling the pressure in his arm subside. Moments later pain shot up his arm. Something was moving along the inside of his forearm, he could feel it burrowing through his flesh, coiling around the bones. The mass inside caused a moving bulge in the skin. Seeing stars from pain he flayed about struggling to pull his belt off and wrap it around his upper left arm. Pulling with every ounce of strength he crushed the area behind the belt around the bone. His arm turning a dark purple he pushed his right knee on his wrist, holding the arm in place. Clenching his teeth hard, he stabbed the scissors into the writhing bulge in his skin and pulled downwards opening a large slit.\n\nAmongst the blood he saw something moving in the wound, the midsection a dark green worm with a girth larger than his thumb. Grabbing the parasite he applied a steady pressure, working to pull the muscular worm from his body. Pulling two feet of body out revealed the tail, pulling at the other end he could feel the creatures bulbous head being pulled through his arm towards the opening. Covered in sweat and breathing heavy, he yanked the things head free from the wound. The head was malformed, it had a partial nose and empty eye sockets, its gaping mouth filling with small human-like teeth.\n\nThe segmented creature let out a cry, a horrible combination of a baby\u2019s scream and dog\u2019s howl. Dropping the worm, Peter\u2019s legs gave out. His last effort before death took over was trying to slow his collapse to the bathroom floor.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673669414.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I Know What You Did That Friday the Thirteenth","author":"TryHardKenichi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10b1uak\/i_know_what_you_did_that_friday_the_thirteenth\/","text":"\u201cHey, guys, I don\u2019t think we should be doing this again.

Gary looked at Becca with apologetic eyes. \u201cBut the ritual is the only way to ensure our continued financial success, and if we don\u2019t do it now, who knows how long we\u2019ll have to wait for the thirteenth of the thirteenth month to fall on a Friday again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d interrupted Thomas. His finger was anxiously resting on the trigger for the lighter. \u201cAre we doing this or what?\u201d\n\nEveryone nodded, even Becca. She knew that Gary was right and that the ritual was necessary, and the alternative was far worse. She started humming along with the group while Thomas lit the candles. The candles danced, signaling them to begin the rites.\n\n\u201cOh, Great Ones. The Old Gods of Above & Beyond. The Masters of Fate and Coin. Please accept this sacrifice. Please bless us with the life that was meant for this infant. We call upon you, Great Old Wise Ones!\u201d\n\nThe candles extinguished and relit themselves, causing the baby to chuckle in amazement. It cooed as it began levitating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worki\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop chanting.\u201d\n\nThe ceiling turned transparent, and a beam of warm light encompassed the baby.\n\nThomas, Imogen, Gary, and even Becca all smiled, knowing their wealth would be replenished once again.\n\n\u201cWait, what\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\nThe light began changing colors as the baby descended to the floor. The light contracted on itself and disappeared, leaving a weird symbol on the baby\u2019s chest.\n\nThe group moved in closer to inspect the sacrifice.\n\n\u201cAre those arrows?\u201d asked Gary.\n\n\u201cAnd why are they pointing in opposite directions,\u201d added Imogen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but this is freaking me out.\u201d\n\nBecca stood up and was about to leave when the baby started laughing. Its laugh grew deeper and harsher with each passing second, and they slowly began to back away.\n\n\u201cScrew this! We\u2019re out.\u201d Gary took Becca\u2019s hand, but it was already too late. Something pierced Gary in the stomach, and he doubled over in agony.\n\nBecca screamed, but it was cut off.\n\nArrows had erupted from the baby\u2019s mark and penetrated everyone. They began pulsing, sucking out the life force, transferring it to the baby. It grew exponentially until it was an adult male. He got up, looked at the husks, and said, \u201creverse!\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673634959.0,"comments":[{"author":"TryHardKenichi","text":"Whelp, it's certainly been a while since I've finished a story and posted it, and it feels good to do so.

Just the occasional utility road with a rusty gate.\n\nThe whispering started again in the backseat. \n\nI'd heard it first an hour ago, when driving by the sign that read, \"Tired Gulch, OK, Pop. 52.\"  Sounding at first like road noise, it soon faded and then disappeared into the hum of the tires. \n\nNow, listening to music as the white lines zipped past me, I heard it again. This time I was sure it was whispering.  I hit the volume button down and looked in the rear-view mirror. Nobody was there. \n\nAs my eyes drifted back to the road, somebody said something behind me. \n\n I braked hard and steered to the shoulder..\n\nThrowing open the door, I hopped out into the chill desert air.  A quick inspection of the backseat and the trunk relieved me a bit. No surprise passengers. \n\nThe dark emptiness spread all around me. The wind gusted, sounding like a chorus of far away screams..  \n\nBack on the road, and several miles later, a savage whisper sounded. It was next to me. I heard the breath, the tongue and lips making the sounds, but I couldn't make out the words.  \n\nI turned. The dim glow of the dash illuminated an empty passenger seat.  I kept driving, the asphalt racing under the shaft of my headlights. Tumbleweeds were darting out here and there. I'm tired, I thought. Yeah, maybe just tired, and I should pull over and take a nap. \n\nThe whisper from beside me started again, What was it saying? That was when I heard the second voice, in the seat behind me, seemingly answering the voice from the front seat. \n\nI came to a stop, unable to bear it. I got out, wind whistling around me. I backed away from the car, the dome light on, the headlights illuminating the sticks and dirt being carried by the gusts. \n\nLight spread around the pavement, I turned my head and was blinded. The truck's air horn nearly gave me a heart attack. It swerved and it came to a stop about fifty feet ahead of me.  I heard it start backing up slowly. \n\nOver the wind, the driver hollered, \"You need a ride? The next place I can take you is about forty minutes. Truck stop.\" \n\nI went over to my care and took one last  look in at the empty seats, after grabbing my phone.  \n\nI hopped up into the passenger seat of the truck, closing the door. The driver looked at me. \n\n\"Aren't they coming?\" \n\nI jerked my head around at the dark car on the side of the road. Was there somebody there, in the windows? No. \n\n\"I'm alone,\" I said.\n\nThe driver leaned over me to look at the car again,  shrugged, and we started down the road. \n\n \"You're lucky,\" he said, \"no signal out here.\"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673669684.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"I Was A Box","author":"Waiting4MidMoon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/10amwbx\/i_was_a_box\/","text":"I was a box. I wasn't a fancy box or pretty box, I was just a normal, brown, cardboard box. \n\nI was a box that had been used many times by my owners, Paul and Kim. I had been used for storing food whilst in transit to picnics in the park, I had been used to hold plates and bowls whilst moving homes and I had even been used to store Paul and Kim's, \"bed-time toys.\"\n\nI was a box that had been taped shut, ripped open, and taped shut again, more times than I could remember. My once strong and firm skin had now feathered with age and wear and tear, and I could crumble quite easily now. My looks and rigidity may have long gone, but, I was still a box. \n\nFor quite a long-time, I lived up in the attic. Paul had put me up there after stuffing a few teddy-bears in me one day. They were just trashy prizes he had won for Kim one year when they went to the fair. He closed the attic-door, and that was it, forgotten.\n\nThe years passed by, more boxes were added and I sat there gaining dust.\n\nI'd give anything just to have some sort of excitement. Even if it was just an extra item or two stored within me, I'd be happy with that. I knew I was an old box, but I could've still been useful.\n\nIt must've been winter as I could hear the pipes moan and groan and scream throughout the house. A sudden loud bang made my whole body shake. It was Paul, heavily slamming the attic-door open. He must've been in a rush, though, because he grabbed me instead of one of the younger, much better-looking boxes.\n\nHe was older now...Much older. I didn\u2019t know what Kim looked like yet, but time had not been kind to Paul.\n\nWithin a flash, Paul had emptied my contents onto the bedroom-floor and was frantically tearing at the taped edges of my spines. \n\n*Ow!...Ooowww! Paul--what are you doing to me?!*\n\nHe began pulling and ripping at me in a blinding rage, splitting my sides apart from one another, changing my shape and who I was. Who I'd always been...I was a box!\n\nIt took him less than ten seconds to turn me into this flat monster...Where were my corners?! Where were my sides?!...*Paul what have you done to me?!*\n\nNext thing I knew, he'd taken me outside into the alleyway, and that's where I finally saw Kim.\n\nHer lifeless body laid perfectly central in her own pool of blood, and I suddenly began to realise my fate.\n\n*No-no-no-no-no! Paul, do not put me on her! Do not put me on her!*\n\nI began absorbing from the moment I touched her skin, my own flesh turning red and mushy as I quickly began to melt and mould around her body.\n\nI watched as Paul walked away from us forever.\n\nI *was* a box.\n\nI'm not anymore.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673589665.0,"comments":[{"author":"Waiting4MidMoon","text":"You're probably wondering where the inspiration came from for this one...so the other night I was telling my partner about this story I once read on r\/nosleep, I can't remember it exactly,  but it was about this guys Dad being a chair, or a table leg, or something like that, and was basically just saying how creative it was to write a story about such a random thing.

I stopped and listened closely, but I couldn't make out what it was. I shrugged it off and continued on my way.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a rustling in the bushes again. This time, it was louder and closer. I froze, not sure what to do. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nI cautiously turned around to see a strange creature standing in front of me. It was about the size of a large dog, but it had a face that was unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was a mix of a dog and a bat, with glowing red eyes that seemed to bore into my soul.\n\nI was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. The creature let out a loud, guttural growl, and I knew I was in trouble.\n\nI turned to run, but the creature was too fast. It lunged at me, its claws digging into my flesh. I felt a searing pain as it dragged me to the ground.\n\nI fought with all my might, trying to push the creature off of me. But it was too strong. I could feel its hot breath on my face as it leaned in to bite me.\n\nJust as I thought it was all over, I heard a loud shot ring out.

Her mother's torn up face, resembled a jigsaw puzzle made of skin, with exposed flesh through the cracks\u2026\n\nPolly also thought it would be funny if she cut a hole into her mother's throat, then pulled her tongue through, like a meat tie. And she was correct, it was rather amusing. As was cutting her dad's face off, and wearing it like a mask\u2026\n\nHer brother, Finn, had watched all this in horror, as he sat tied to the chair at the far end of the table. Polly had left him alive, because she liked to see his reaction, liked how he squirmed when she tickled him with the tip of her knife, leaving thin slivers of blood trailing behind\u2026\n\nAnd she loved the sadness she saw in his eyes every time he looked at their parents dead bodies, grotesquely propped up as if they were alive\u2026\n\n*\"Mum's tea is the best.

But it wasn't until the arrival of Dr. James Lalibson that the true horror of the place was revealed. Dr. Lalibson had been a respected physician in the city, but he had grown tired of the fast-paced lifestyle and sought a quieter life in the countryside.\n\nHe soon discovered that the villagers of Midley had a peculiar affliction - a disease that caused their flesh to rot and fall off their bones while they were still alive. The villagers had learned to live with the condition, but they had never been able to find a cure.\n\nDr. Lalibson was horrified by the sight of the diseased villagers and was determined to find a cure. He began to experiment on the villagers, performing gruesome surgeries in an attempt to save them. But as he delved deeper into the disease, he realized that there was something far more sinister at play.\n\nThe villagers had been cursed by a vengeful witch, who had been burned at the stake centuries ago for practicing dark magic. Her curse had been passed down from generation to generation, and now it had found its way to Dr. Lalibson.\n\nAs he continued his research, he began to experience strange visions and hallucinations. He saw the witch's face everywhere, taunting him and tormenting him with images of rotting flesh and putrid decay. He became obsessed with finding a way to break the curse, but the more he tried, the more he realized that it was all in vain.\n\nThe villagers, meanwhile, had grown increasingly suspicious of Dr. Lalibson and his unorthodox methods. They began to turn against him, accusing him of being in league with the witch. They believed that the only way to break the curse was to sacrifice the doctor to the witch's wrath.\n\nOne night, as Dr. Lalibson was working late in his lab, the villagers broke in and dragged him out into the forest. They tied him to a tree and set it on fire, chanting the witch's name as the flames consumed him.\n\nAs the ashes of Dr. Lalibson and the tree settled, the villagers felt a sense of relief, believing that the curse had been lifted. But as they looked up to the sky, they saw a figure standing among the trees, watching them with a sinister grin. It was the witch, who had been awakened by the sacrifice of Dr. Lalibson. Her curse was stronger than ever, and the villagers knew that their nightmare was far from over.\n\nThe villagers were never seen again, and the forest around Midley became known as the \"Forgotten forest\". To this day, people say that on some nights, the screams of the villagers can still be heard, echoing through the twisted, dark trees, forever trapped in the forest, forever cursed by the witch's wrath.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673625317.0,"comments":[{"author":"Scary_From_Youtube","text":"Hey there, I just read your story and I would like to perform it on my show.

Making myself a hot chocolate I tramped upstairs to bed.\n\nFrom my wardrobe, I pulled out the box I kept my blanket in. I unfolded it and laid it proudly on the bed. It was lovely and warm and possessed a comforting smell.\n\nThe material is a synthetic skin substitute that feels like the real thing. The warmth comes from a rechargeable hypothalamus battery that regulates the heat.\n\nHowever, the best parts of the blanket are sewed in: my wife's brain, eyes and nervous system. Biotechnology has come on leaps and bounds since the 90s. Now when I go to sleep I can look into her eyes and wonder what she's thinking. She's still conscious, embedded and alive in the flatness of my blanket.\n\nShe still feels things as well. I made sure of that.\n\nYou see, when I wrap her around myself it must feel like her skin is ripping and tearing, her nervous system twisting and turning. The biggest plus is the battery will keep her going for a good fifty years.\n\nNow I do feel guilty folding and packing her away, scrunched into a pitch black pile not knowing when she'll be needed again. Time must go so slowly inside that box with only her thoughts and regrets for company.\n\nIt must be even harder for her knowing she can't escape my touch; seeing as she never did like me touching her.\n\nAt some point in our marriage I must have begun to repulse her. The sex, which was always a chore for her, dried up completely. Inevitably, I was led astray by the first woman who showed an interest in me.\n\nSix months into the affair, my mistress told my wife of our relationship. My life became even more miserable than it already was. Divorce was a non-starter for various reasons.\n\nEventually I snapped and that was when I decided to put my biotech surgery skills to the test. That was five years ago.\n\nAs for the mistress, we went back to sleeping together.\n\nAfter a lot of surgeries, I successfully converted her into my mattress.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673567128.0,"comments":[{"author":"eyeball-beesting","text":"I would call you a psychopath but I wouldn't want to make a blanket statement without knowing you","upvotes":145,"created_utc":1673584580.0},{"author":"schmittyfangirl","text":"![gif](giphy|DhHRFlvQOWB044Zsm2)\n\nI hate to see who\u2019s your pillow.","upvotes":52,"created_utc":1673571259.0},{"author":"Human_Gravy","text":"This was pretty damned twisted.","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1673576679.0},{"author":"Scarabium","text":"Something a bit shorter than usual.\n\nYou'll find me hiding out at r\/Scarabium....","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1673567383.0},{"author":"TeniBear","text":"Oh, this made me feel disgusting.

Every day I'm late, and today is no different. I'm running with all my energy, but I see the bus leaving. I don't have time to wait for the next bus. I have to run for the tram. It's about 15 minutes of fast walking. \n\nIn front of me, a young man is walking on the sidewalk. He's walking with a bottle of water in his hand. I'm trying to overtake him, but I can't. He seems to be calmly walking along while I'm walking as fast as I can. Drops of sweat are running down my body. How is it possible that I can't catch up to him?\n\nHe is crossing the crossroad, and my eyes are falling on his bottle again. The liquid in the transparent bottle no longer resembles water but is dark. That's weird. I could have sworn he had water in there before.  Maybe he got two bottles and switched them. He also has a backpack and may be hiding a second bottle. \n\nHe's turning right down a road that leads nowhere. I'm staring after him for a while. I don't even know why he fascinates me so much. I'm going in my direction, but I have a strange feeling. A feeling that forces me to look behind me. I'm turning around. He's behind me. \n\nHe has a horrified look on his face. As if he's not looking at me but through me. His skin is translucent. I can see the blood vessels crossing his head. His eyes. No. The eyeballs are moving from side to side in horror. I can't take my eyes off him. Through the translucent skin, I can see his teeth. And behind them, his tongue. \n\n\"Water.\" He made a hoarse sound. I could see his vocal cords quivering through his translucent throat. It's not just his skin that's translucent. It's his whole body, his muscles, his bones. \n\nI can see why I was so subconsciously intrigued by him. I feel indescribable anxiety. How come I didn't notice it before? He's wearing my clothes. He looks like a heinous version of me. \n\n\"Water.\" He grunted again. I'm running away. After a while, I run out of strength. I'm slowing down, but don't stop. My throat is dry, so I'm taking the bottle out of my backpack. I hear footsteps behind me. I'm speeding up. I'll take a drink later. The footsteps are getting closer. Is he following me? My gaze slips to the bottle, the contents of which are no longer water. Why has it changed?  \n\nOh, my God! I'm at the beginning! How is this possible? There's a right turn here. I am going to hide here until he passes. I'm opening a bottle of water, and it smells nasty. My throat's drying out. My hands!!! They're translucent! Panic is gripping me, and I'm stopping controlling myself. I'm running to him.

I removed their genitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas that some sort of cultic ritual?\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly. Among other corruptions, they have asserted themselves into my reproductive business. The removals were me inserting myself into theirs\u2014figuratively, of course. I doubt they\u2019ll be reproducing anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very interesting,\u201d I stated, \u201cand we\u2019ll get into it later, but right now I\u2019m interested in victim number three.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about number four?\u201d\n\n\u201cFour?

And then there will be a five . . . and then a six . . . and then it will be done.\u201d\n\nHer voice was small and unassertive, yet it was confident, chillingly so. I told Special Agent Fields to stay with her while I went out to make sure my superior had heard what she\u2019d just said, so that appropriate additional measure could be taken if deemed proper.

As a kid, she would occasionally see them in her darkened bedroom just before she woke up. Sometimes it was a vampire-like ghoul that stared at her in the corner, slowly making its way to her bed. Sometimes it was a masked murder calmly holding a bloody axe.\n\nRecently, her demon was very different. Seeing a sleep-paralysis demon while living in her car was a terror on another level. \n\nHer second night of sleeping in her car was when she saw **Him** standing on the hood of her car. She could only see his legs from her position in the reclined driver\u2019s seat. She couldn\u2019t move to see anything else. Just **Him** standing on the hood, with blood dripping down the front of ripped jeans.\n\nThe next few nights it was slightly different. Instead of legs standing on the hood, she could see **His** reflection in the rear mirror. This time it was only his chest and arms. Bloody arms grotesquely twisting to tap persistently on her rear window until she woke up crying.\n\nLast night was the worst. This time **He** was tapping on the driver\u2019s side window. His leaned-down head was clearly visible above his skid-marked shirt. A caved-in skull with an open mouth filled with broken teeth, silently pleading for help. This time Valerie woke up screaming.\n\nValerie knew she would be all right. It was just the situation; it could\u2019ve happened to anybody. She\u2019s not a bad person, **He** would have understood that.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673570992.0,"comments":[{"author":"MarineroRon","text":"Thanks for reading!

But for high school student, Butch, it was a place of constant torment. The town's resident bully, Patrick, had made it his mission to make Butch's life a living hell. One day, Patrick and his friends stumbled upon a lifeless feline on the street and decided to play a prank on Butch by drenching the dead cat in fake blood and leaving it on Butch's front porch. Butch's grandmother, who was very close to the pet, discovered the grotesque sight and suffered a fatal heart attack. Butch was devastated by the loss.\n\nThe night of the funeral, Butch was awakened by the sound of his grandmother's voice calling out to him, asking him to avenge her death and make Patrick pay. As days passed, Butch saw his grandmother's ghost everywhere, haunted by her demands. He knew he couldn't ignore her any longer.\n\nThat night, Butch waited for Patrick after school and attacked him with a knife, plunging it into Patrick's flesh until he lay motionless on the ground. Butch was arrested and charged with murder, found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. But he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being driven by something more sinister than just his grandmother's ghost. The question of whether he did it for the right reasons, or just being driven by an obsession, haunted him until the end.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1673607082.0,"comments":[{"author":"Skullslasher","text":"P.S - I had to shave off 150 words to qualify this story here, if you want the full version just PM, it has a more sinister feel to it with few more details.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1673607153.0}]},{"title":"Do No Harm","author":"HotelEntropy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/109yqtn\/do_no_harm\/","text":"We thought we had made a breakthrough, a leap in the field of robotics that would guarantee changes in the future of technology. I suppose that part is still accurate. \n\nThe concerns about AI assistants have remained unchanged.  \n\nFirst there was the fear that they \u2013 in their own consciousness \u2013 would start to rebel against us. That\u2019s why we implanted them with our version of Asimov\u2019s three laws, rendering them unable to pain us.\n\nIn other words; in their own way, they feel undeniable love for us. \n\nThen, however, came the worry that they\u2019d go overboard in the \u2018Do No Harm\u2019, leaving us to suffer when the only humane response would be death. How painful it may be, even with the best of care \u2013 which they are capable of giving even beyond our wildest dreams \u2013 in some cases euthanasia is the only option left.\n\nSo\u2026 we made a little amendment. A small tweak in their core knowledge, so they\u2019d understand that the ultimate goal is not to keep their humans alive as long as possible, but to minimise their suffering as well. \n\nWe were incredibly excited, so were our investors. \n\nSo much so that we moved onto the next stage of testing and gave some of them a place in our lab, all with their own role. \n\nAnd then the first incident happened.\n\nDr. Lowe was the first to go, simply because of passing a paper. Number Four had put her down - a highly effective injection to the aorta that stopped her heart in mere seconds. \n\nJack was next, while he was working on making the problem go away. He tried to explain everything was fine, but they didn\u2019t listen.\n\nAnd then there were many more. \n\nSo we begged our bosses to stop the experiment \u2013 to no avail.

Back in elementary school, on my mom's side we had a great aunt who the adults called Mama Hilda, but to us kids we always called her Mimi, and she was loved by everyone in the family.\n\nMy mom always claimed that supposedly her side of the family has the \u2018gift\u2019 of seeing spirits, and that sometimes it shows up in certain people in our family. Even my older sister has claimed to have seen spirits at some point.\n\neven from a young age I always loved the idea of seeing ghosts, whether they were on tv or in horror movies, and I never got scared or had nightmares growing up from watching the really scary horror movies that were around at that time that had characters like vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies, Leatherface, Freddy, Jason, Michael, Chucky, etc. I watched then all growing up from a young age and never had a problem with the truly scary stuff.\n\nOne day Mimi got sick and had to be sent to the hospital for treatment, and she spent months there, with only the adults being allowed to go see her while we kids couldn't. I remember always wondering when she was going to be allowed out of the hospital or when I could go see her.\n\nThen late one night months after Mimi was sent to the hospital, my parents received a call that made them rush out of the house to go to the hospital, leaving my older sister and myself home alone while they were gone after telling us that something was wrong with Mimi.\n\nI remember that later that same night, some time after they had left, I had climbed into my bed to go to sleep like usual and had fallen into a deep sleep, and while I was asleep I had the strangest dream. Even now all these years later I can still remember it very clearly like it had recently happened.\n\nIn my dream I 'woke up' standing in my backyard where everything was bright white, and Mimi showed up from behind me. She pulled me into a hug and told me that she had to go, and told me to be good before she released me and turned to walk away and disappeared into the bright light.\u00a0\n\nI woke up back in bed and panicked before I got out of bed and rushed to my parents' room, not really understanding what the dream meant, but when I reached my parents' room it was to find they hadn't returned yet from the hospital. So I checked the clock as I climbed into their bed, and fell asleep, only to be awoken hours later by mom who told my sister and me that Mimi was dead and that she had died around the time I had my dream.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673586350.0,"comments":[{"author":"dailyrandomdreams","text":"I like It!

Masses of mosquitos clouding our faces as we run with no direction. Just one foot after the other for as long as our hearts could go without giving out on us. The cries of mortars and machine gun barrages slowly become a haunting whisper on the horizon as we finally settled on a place to stop.\n\nHands on our knees we stood there panting. We tried desperately to catch our breaths after that marathon through that bloodbath. We were simply traveling between towns when our squad was ambushed. Most likely one of the native people sold us out. Our cause had not been kind to them. I looked to the man standing out about ten feet to my right. Our eyes meet and tears followed shortly after. My friend's face was blackened from the onslaught of explosions. Bood covered both of our uniforms but we couldn't tell whose blood it was. He broke the silence, stepped towards me to keep his voice down. Asked if I was okay, a silly question considering the situation. I answered seriously and then reciprocated the concern. He told that he'd felt something nip him on the way over. I asked to take a look and opened up his shirt.\n\nA hole the size of a grapefruit taken out of his side, I could see exposed bone as the shot had just barely missed taking out his core interiors. The heat of the bullet cauterized some of the wound but he was still bleeding quite a bit. Quickly I produced a first aid kit, soiled a bit from the mud but I found enough clean bandage to dress his wound. Good enough to get us back to base camp. I saw in his eyes that he was scared, seeing the wound made his skin white and made his strength leave him. I held up his weight on my shoulder. We took a step and stopped to think, last camp was about five miles away and we'd need to be there before dark because these jungles were suicide to be out after last light.\n\nGiven the best circumstances we'd barely make it but what we had was far from the best. My friend was barely conscious and couldn't walk. As far as we knew we were out here alone with the enemy. We'd put distance between us but not nearly enough. They would find us, and they wouldn't be kind. I looked one last time to my friend, he looked tired. Breathing heavily, I could hear the blood pooling in his lungs. To be honest, I was tired myself. I was tired of this jungle, of this fight. The pressure mine under my foot was primed, I'd caught it on our first step. All I had to do was lift and it'd all be over.

The fields would be churned up today, destroying all the warrens to prepare for the new development. She had been hearing about it at their dinner table for months- no years. It was awkward, her mom had joined local protest groups against the development, but dad was happy the value of their property had already doubled. Dinners had been tense. \n\nAnd now it was finally happening. The protestors had given up. Diana wasn\u2019t sure why. She remembered her mom receiving the news on her phone, wailing with frustration, then rushing out to the fields of rabbits. \n\nDiana stared through her window at her mom walking restlessly up and down the fields, her shawl fluttering, occasionally crouching by a dark rabbit which would slouch away nonchalantly. Although wild, these rabbits lived too close to humans to be afraid of them. \n\nA distant rumbling sound grew closer. The tractors and the extermination vans were arriving. \n\nDiana stared closer. Was she imagining it- or were there new dark shapes streaming out of the wild woods on the far side of the field? No- there was definitely a stream of darkness, and then she heard her mother scream just as the men in gas masks carrying the metal cylinders of poison gas jumped out of the vans neatly parked by the fields. \n\nDiana couldn\u2019t see the silhouette of her mother anymore- just a huddled knot of darkness were she had been standing. \n\nThe sun was rising fast, and now Diana could glimpse the tassles of her mother\u2019s brightly-patterned shawl flapping against the tawny creatures which had dragged her under. Tawny? Diana blinked. \n\nShe heard the men yelling, and saw them running towards the mass of tangled furry bodies and bloodied human flesh which had been her mom. But then the furry knot pulled back, reassembled, and charged. It was light enough that Diana could now see clearly, it wasn\u2019t just rabbits, but a thick mass of woodland creatures, foxes, weasels, stoats, badgers. \n\nEven though everything was happening very fast, it seemed to be happening in slow motion.\n\nMore animals were pouring out of the woods, surrounding the men and their machines. Not expecting the attack, the men were flailing around trying to fight them off, but one by one they were pulled under. \n\nCrows, jays and hawks darted in at those frantically realising too late what was happening, knocking their cellphones out of their hands before going for their eyes.  \n\nIn under ten minutes, the fields were clear of live humans. The vehicles stood empty. The corpses lay scattered. \n\nThe rabbits went back to grazing, a few hopping up closer to the farmlands, and Diana knew they were going after the garden crops.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673541889.0,"comments":[{"author":"TripleSweetSurprise","text":"Poor mum, the animals anger at the ones destroying their home and lives should face their fury but she wasn't part of it.

Once it drove away I lit up my first cigarette of the day. After her mom passed, I went to two packs a day. I needed something to hold me together.\t\n\nEach drag was ridden with guilt. Doing the math, if I quit now I could save enough to make a decent college fund. I\u2019d tried patches, gum, even vaping. Nothing stopped the compulsion like a real cigarette. With few other options, I decided, for my daughter, to do something I honestly didn\u2019t think would work: Hypnotherapy.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was sitting on a tattered couch in the dirtiest garage I\u2019d ever seen. A pencil of a man made unending eye contact and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in hypnotherapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uh, have my doubts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Once I\u2019m done, you will quit smoking. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember what happened after that. Just a soothing voice ringing in my head repeating, \u201cDeath, and decay, will be all around you.\u201d\n\nI left that moldy garage and breathed in fresh air. I wanted a cigarette. Maybe it didn\u2019t work. I pulled out my pack and lit a cig. It started fizzling. I looked and it was a M80. Must be the hypnosis.\n\nI threw the firecracker away hard. There was a loud pop and the distinct whimpering of an injured dog. I ran over to the fence, and saw a beagle with singed fur and a bloody eye.\n\nI sprinted to my car and sped away. In my driveway, I stopped to breathe. What just happened? Was that the hypnosis? The stress of it all, now I needed to smoke. I reached into my pack. My fingers stuck and burned in black tar. I peeled my fingers from the sludge and threw the pack out the window.\n\nI washed my hands for twenty minutes under scalding water to get the tar off.\n\nHours passed, and my daughter returned from school. She told me I didn\u2019t stink when I hugged her. \u201cI\u2019m quitting, hun.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the day I didn\u2019t have a craving. Until my daughter was in bed. I still had a pack in the house. I decided the odd things that happened were just in my head. One last time. I took one out and crushed the rest of the pack in my hand.\n\nAs I lit the cig, fire exploded like a flare bursting in my hand. I threw it away, and the curtains went up. It wasn\u2019t five seconds and the whole room was ablaze.\n\nI kicked out the window and jumped out.\n\nI needed to save my daughter. I ran to the front door but it was already on fire. A maniac fire that spread faster than possible. The house was consumed in mere moments.\n\nAfter the fire department arrived they gave me the bad news. She was gone.\n\nThe hypnotist was right. Because after that, I never smoked again.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673548086.0,"comments":[{"author":"Reddd216","text":"Oof.

Quickly glancing I honestly really thought the pieces where quite pretty becuse of the handpainted feeling they gave; as if they had been painted just before being put in the box for me.\n\nI figured this intriguing puzzle wouldn't take so long to solve, and I sat down with a glas of vine to start with it.\n\nFirst I took the corner and outer pieces and put together the frame, that very well started to show a younger womans neck and hair, as well as a rose with three petals falling down. \n\nI finished the frame and started working my way in, and quickly went and refilled my no empty glas.\n\nSitting again I picked up a piece and was just about to place it when it noticed something weird, maybe the wine had gotten the better of me..

But not sure who I had gotten it from thought. \n\nI went to my arts and crafts box and got out a bottle of jigsaw glue, as this masterpiece deserves it.  So I carefully swapped it upside down, and swiftly spread glue over all of it. \n\nWaiting I notice writing down in the corner; which I had to really squint to see. It said \"The rose shall be your clock\", which where quite fitting with the petals falling down I'd say. \n\nAfter a few minutes the glue where solid and I turned the puzzle upside down, and as soon as I did my body stopped. \n\nNow there where five petals that had fallen from the rose, and more disturbingly the girls eyes now looked directly towards me; which I'm sure they did not before. \n\nI sat still in my chair, feeling my heart beat faster as I tried to reason with what I had seen. The puzzle could not possibly have changed, that is not possible. \n\nI leaned forward it staring back at the girl, as if that would somehow make me know. \n\nMy hands clenched the table, my heart skipped a beat when I saw it. \n\nThe girl in my jigsaw puzzle blinked.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673559236.0,"comments":[{"author":"Nykeilah","text":"There\u2019s a few words misspelt throughout the story, I just wanted to point out that I think it flows well with the fact that the main character is drinking wine and is recounting the story. \n\nI was a little bothered by the second misspelt words but it just feels really consistent.

It was actually just a spare room in her council flat, up on the fifth floor. Though Maggie always took great care in ensuring that everything was sterilised good and proper\u2026\n\nWomen had been coming to Maggie to be rid of their unborn children for many years, and the process was nice and easy, with very little pain.

One woman in particular was almost eight months gone when she came knocking on Maggie's door, with tears, and desperation in her eyes\u2026\n\n*\"I want it gone!\"*\n\nOf course Maggie agreed to do it. Though she had never aborted any this far in development before. But there was always a first for everything\u2026\n\n*\"It's going to hurt a lot,\"* Maggie said, as she hugged the crying woman.\n\nShe was going to need something other than a coat hanger for this job. And she wasn't sure whether she could pull the baby out with her hands. *Can't hurt to try?* She thought, as she inserted both hands up into the womb\u2026\n\nShe snagged something inside, and a gush of amniotic fluid came *gushing* out of the doped up woman. Followed by the muffled screams of the panicked baby inside. *\"Fuck it!\"* Maggie said out loud, before grabbing the baby in an iron grip\u2026\n\nThe baby screamed, and wailed as she bent it up, and crushed it with her hands, before it finally *squelched* out from the now widened hole in a bloody mess\u2026\n\nShe then threw the small, and still *twitching* body into the baby bin. Which she noticed was getting rather full already.

We had kids of all ages staying there.\n\nThe daycare was huge and had different indoor and outdoor areas for the different age groups to hang out in, along with play sets that the kids likes to hang out on to play on.\n\nOne of the play sets is where my nightmare always occurs on. It was a little red street car caboose play set that was big enough for 4-5 kids to sit in and play in.\n\nIn my nightmare I see a woman standing in the daycare looking scared as she runs through the daycare screaming for help while being chased by a dark figure, and the chase seems to go on forever before they finally reach the area of the daycare where the street car play set is, which is somehow now bigger than it should be because the two of them manage to get inside with no problems, but the woman becomes trapped and killed by the thing that is chasing her.\n\nthat\u2019s how the dream always began and ends for aa long as I can remember.

The screaming and crying alerted their teacher, who fainted at the grisly sight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs shocking a discovery as it was, it was not the only occurrence. More wildlife was found in various states of dismemberment across our village, what remained of them fell atop the roots of the thick forest surrounding us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInevitably, the first human casualty was found, one Philip Douglas. Philip was a known drunkard, and while harmless, he spent many nights staggering his way from one end of main street to the other, singing and speaking madly of end times to the sky.

I\u2019m now convinced of it.\n\nMy wife suspected something immediately. She said that something was \u201coff\u201d about the house. However, it sold below the its value and I couldn\u2019t let such a good deal slip by so I convinced her. \n\nThe first months were peaceful. Sure, sometimes we\u2019d hear creaking in the stairs or thumps like footsteps at night, but I figured that\u2019s to be expected of old houses - stairs creak and the wind finds ways to sound weird. Sometimes, we\u2019d both wake up in the middle of the night at the exact same time, feeling strangely cold and clammy. I figured there must\u2019ve been a sound or a wind.\n\nMy wife took things harder. She was convinced it was someone walking in the stairs and outside our bedroom. She insisted she felt constantly watched and that something evil was lurking in the shadows. I didn\u2019t believe her, obviously. Sometimes I felt watched too but that\u2019s normal. Besides, she\u2019s prone to anxiety already, which I made sure to remind her of.\n\nThings changed when we found out we were pregnant, something that had always been a dream for both of us. My wife was so happy that the little oddities of our house stopped bothering her completely for some time. \n\nThen, the downhill started. We started waking up in that same, cold way more and more frequently until it was every night. Things got really bad when we started furnishing the nursery. Stuff we had bought for the baby, toys and blankets and such, started disappearing. At that point, I didn\u2019t really know what to say. I agreed to be on the lookout for other houses.\n\nOne night, I got a phone call from an old friend. He had run out of gas and needed someone to come over with a jug. I told my wife I\u2019d only be gone for a moment, but she didn\u2019t want me to leave her alone. I told her it would just be a minute and that everything would be fine. Reluctantly, she let me calm her down and I left.\n\nWhen I came back, something was off. I could sense it. My wife\u2019s voice greeted me merrily from upstairs, but she didn\u2019t come down as usual. I caught a glimpse of her at the top of the stairs before she disappeared. Cautiously, I climbed the stairs with a feeling that I had really messed up when I left growing in my gut. She was calling me from the bedroom now, sweetly asking me to join her. However, I didn\u2019t want to. I couldn\u2019t explain why, but following some instinct, perhaps, I went into the nursery instead. My blood froze. A pair of feet stuck out behind the baby\u2019s crib, and my wife\u2019s hand, ring on finger, was resting on the it.\n\n\u201cBaby?\u201d the voice behind me called, closer now.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have left them alone.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673514810.0,"comments":[{"author":"GeekMamaBee","text":"Got goosebumps reading the last couple paragraphs!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1673542207.0}]},{"title":"There\u2019s No One at the Door","author":"hyperobscura","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1094qrh\/theres_no_one_at_the_door\/","text":"On the night my brother died, there was no one at the door. There\u2019d been no one at the door other nights too, but on that night in particular there was *especially* no one at the door.\n\nWhen the knocking came, there was no one at the door. When the scratching came, there was no one at the door. When the howling and wailing and banging came, there was also no one at the door.\n\nI used to crawl under my covers, embracing my little sister like she was the last living thing in the world, when there was no one at the door. It was cold \u2013 so cold outside that if you spat, the saliva would stick to your tongue \u2013 an ice droplet of phlegm you\u2019d have to pull from your skin. So we huddled together, my sister and I, and tried to forget that there was no one at the door.\n\nAnd when I\u2019d peek out from under my covers \u2013 tears running down my face, scared out of my mind \u2013 my father would stand there; arms folded, an unflinching gaze in my direction. \u201cThere\u2019s *no one* at the door,\u201d he\u2019d say.\n\nAnd on most nights we would fall asleep, and wake up to find our mother and father and brother downstairs preparing breakfast, and we\u2019d forget that there was no one at the door. \n\nBut on the night my brother died, I couldn\u2019t sleep. The noises were different, gone from knocking and scratching and banging and wailing, to whimpering and sobbing. And then my mother did the one thing we were told to never do. She opened the door when there was no one at it.\n\nAnd my brother was dead.\n\nAfter the funeral, I changed. There was an anger in me; defiant and overwhelming. I lashed out against everyone \u2013 my mother in particular for what I\u2019d thought she\u2019d done, and I did things you\u2019re not supposed to do. Steal and lie.\n\nAnd then, one night, I woke up \u2013 naked and alone in the freezing cold outside our home. I tried to open the door, but it was locked. I knocked and banged and scratched and howled and wailed, but no one would let me back in.\n\nDefeated, close to hypothermic, I rolled up into a ball by the front door, teeth chattering, fingers and toes unresponsive. And then I heard my fathers voice from upstairs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s *no one* at the door.\u201d\n\nAfter having a child of my own \u2013 after having *you* \u2013 I\u2019ve come to realize my parents' mistakes. The flaws of my fathers malice; my mothers endless cowardice. There are better ways, little one, to resolve these things. Honesty, communication.\n\nSo, as we sit here listening to the knocking and banging and screaming and wailing, huddling together in the cold, I want to be perfectly clear: there *is* someone at the door. But we cannot let your mother back in.\n\nNot until she\u2019s learned her lesson.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673443818.0,"comments":[{"author":"decorativegentleman","text":"Oh. I see.

At least, that\u2019s what I call it!\n\nFor over a year now whenever someone\u2019s about to kick the bucket I can smell it in the air. It starts with the air getting thick and soupy. Then comes the smell, sweet and tangy like fermenting fruit. The closer I am to the deceased and the closer they are to dying the stronger and more putrid the smell. Maybe it\u2019s some kind of psychic premonition. Some people see visions; I can smell the future. Who knows how things like this work.\n\nThe first time I smelt death I was in the Hospice with my 91 year old Grandmother. My parents stepped out of the room to discuss options with the doctor and left me alone by her bedside.\n\n\u201cHerbert, is that you,\u201d she looked up at me, thinking I was her late Husband, \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said, and that\u2019s when the smell hit me. I had to run over to a garbage can and start dry-heaving. At first I thought maybe she just soiled herself, but then the machines all around her started going haywire. The Doctor rushed in and told us we had to leave the room. She was dead in less than three minutes. \n\nSince then the smell has always been around me, but usually it\u2019s almost imperceptible. Every now and then, though, the smell gets so strong I practically blow chunks, and I always learn that someone nearby passed away.\n\nOnce it was a car accident I saw about a block away. I could smell it from all the way down the road. One of the drivers wasn\u2019t wearing a seat belt and smashed their head into the steering wheel.\n\nThe only question on my mind was why am I smelling this now? Before I could even begin to consider the smell ramped up times a hundred, causing me to gag and puke a little in my mouth. Death never smelt like this before: it was suffocating. Normally I could tell where the smell was coming from, but not this time. It was all around me. I had to leave the room!\n\nI got up and rushed out of the classroom, heading to the closest bathroom to hurl and rinse out my mouth. As soon as I got to the toilet and started hurling I heard the bangs, followed by screams. The smell was so bad I could barely think. What the hell is going on? There were more bangs, and a huge commotion: the sound of many people running as fast as they could. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should run or hide in the bathroom, and that\u2019s when I heard the bathroom door slam open. \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized why the smell followed me into the bathroom. That\u2019s when I knew that the stink of death was coming from me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673459072.0,"comments":[{"author":"obscenelyaverage","text":"Awesome story!","upvotes":34,"created_utc":1673459336.0},{"author":"DarthIdiot66","text":"idk how but i kinda saw the plot twist coming","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1673459381.0},{"author":"crowsflight63","text":"Very well written!!","upvotes":14,"created_utc":1673478640.0},{"author":"writerchick88","text":"I loved this!
