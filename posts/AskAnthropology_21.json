Thought it would be worth a shot (and probably should have done so earlier) and ask if anyone has notes/essays/ they wouldn't mind sharing for my exam prep, I'd be very grateful. \n\nThe module is on Development- we've been looking at specifically development in relation to sexuality, socialist and postsocialist movements, social movements and the subjective turn, Foucault's influence on Ferguson, Escobar and the likes.

        "text": "I'm a teacher in the UK where a recent physics exam asked a question about a complex method of measuring the liquid volume of a sealed vessel by injecting radioactive isotopes (and thus avoiding having to open the vessel). The question implied that this was a real archaeological method. I have my doubts because I struggle to think of any reason why a vessel would be so sensitive that it's important to keep sealed but also not too sensitive to inject radioactive isotopes into.\n\nThe premise of the question was that you could use a syringe to add a radioactive isotope. After leaving it to mix with the rest of the liquid (and decay), you could then use the syringe again to remove a sample. By comparing the activity of the retrieved sample with the initial activity of what was injected, you could estimate the volume of liquid that it was diluted by inside the vessel.\n\nHas anyone ever heard of something along those lines being done? My students and I were both curious but it turns out to be a difficult question to answer using Google!\n\nAlternatively, does anyone know of other unusual and interesting uses of radioactive isotopes in this kind of context that I could build my own questions around? (Dating using Carbon or Uranium content is already a commonly used example but I'd love to have something a bit different to challenge students with.)\n\nI hope this is an appropriate venue for the question. The sidebar mentions archaeology but I haven't seen many other questions about archaeological methods (and the \"method\" I'm asking about might not even be real, which would only decrease the relevance!).\n\n**tl;dr** Has anyone ever heard of injecting radioactive isotopes into a sealed container of liquid in order to estimate the volume of the contents without unsealing it?",

As a descriptive position cultural relativism isn't contested, but as a normative position, perhaps more appropriately referred to as moral or ethical relativism, Herskovits and other moral relativists have been deeply criticized since the 40s. When Ruth Benedict realized that normative cultural relativism meant a tolerance of Nazi Germany she quickly abandoned any previous normative positions she held on the matter. But Herskovits while aware of the critiques so many philosophers made of normative cultural relativism, as far as I can tell never actually addressed these critiques. Going through his later work on the subject and his responses to people like Paul Schmidt he typically would address their criticisms by going to lengths to reaffirm cultural relativism as an descriptive axiom, ignoring the complications of his own normative position (that because there is no universal moral truths we cannot make value judgements on the ethical frameworks of other cultures).

Both include both museum and field work. Aside from the differences in content, MA Social Anthropology would take two years as I don't have a Social Sciences background. MA Peace and Conflict would take one year as any background is acceptable.\n\nOverall, I'd say the first course is more abstract and perhaps more academic, while the other seems more specialised and career-focussed. I'm a bit apprehensive about the politics and history aspect of the second course as I have no experience of studying these either formally or personally, but I think I could find it an interesting challenge.\n\nI've already made the mistake of doing a literature degree with no real destination in mind, which has led me to a job that's fine but not completely satisfying. I'd like to work either in research or at an NGO, or perhaps a museum if I found a stimumlating role -- so which degree do you think would give me the best chance of getting to that point?\n\nI'd really appreciate some input from people who've done similar things, as I have no real knowledge of the subject and it's a pretty huge financial investment. I've seen quite a lot of \"what do I do after an anthropology degree\" posts around here, so don't want to end up in the same position I'm in now if I can help it! Sorry if this is the wrong sub.",

I know that most Egyptologists think the idea is ridiculous because there aren't really any other anomalies that match this in similar contexts during the proposed time in history. But I know some have raised the findings of gobekli tepe as supporting evidence and I have to admit I am unqualified to say anything about any of this. I just don't want to get stuck in pseudoscience.  \n\nOne other thing I wanted to mention:\n\nThe Sphinx is officially attributed to Khafre, but until Ramesses II, weren't Pharaohnic attributions regularly carved over or erased by succeeding Pharaohs? I know that this was a huge reason Ramesses started the practice of making deep carvings set into the stone so it would be much harder for future Pharaoh's to erase his history. I just wonder if this has any effect whatsoever on our ability to both date the Sphinx and properly attribute its building to a specific Pharaoh or Dynasty. PLEASE let me know if my thinking is off in anyway, I'm looking for any and all criticism here. Thank you again!",

Especially relevant as academics/professors day-to-day work looks more like administration.\n\nI’ve recently been doing a lot of thinking about macro scale systems of rational thought and the religionization of it in a sense. In other words the follow-the-math thinking that dictates how we do everything from managing our personal lives to quantum mechanics. And there’s a push with each successive generation to regard those who don’t engage with it as “primitive”.\n\nWhile there are undebatable accomplishments that have been achieved through this framework, there are other instances (economics for example) where you run into the chicken or the egg problem. Does an intensive algebraic understanding of human relationships actually work and drive growth, or does a collective cultural insistence on its reality mimic growth? \n\nIf you composed a history of thought systems we see a doubling down of empirical, rational and mathematical systems as a direct result of the two world wars. Some amazing thinkers were engaged in a more fluid understanding of moral philosophy and hundreds of esoteric schools were opening around the world before the destruction of europe. A natural fear of idealism and intellectual progress after World War II curbed these tendencies.\n\nSo after World War II, as we’ve gone global, we’ve also discredited thinking that falls outside of what people consider the hard sciences (this is what’s killing the humanities in the United States).\n\nDoes anybody know of any anthropology programs/professors that are specifically in dialogue with these concepts as it relates to western society today?\n\nIn other words, studying rational thought and the mathematical underpinning of the global west’s interaction with the world as a cultural object rather than an inherent truth.\n",

        "text": "Hi! \n\nI've come to r/AskAnthropology because I'm very lost on my topic of interest. I have also posted this in r/AskHistorians since it's kind of a combo question.\n\nI'm researching Pre-Colombian and contemporary Mexico religious practices. My specific focus is on the Aztecs since (for the sake of my research) they seem to have the biggest spotlight on them next to the Maya when it comes to documentation. \n\nWhile I have found a ton of information on the mythology and cosmology, there are a series of terms that keep popping up during my readings and they have been bugging me because they seem to be obscure terms only known to Nahuatl speakers. None of my professors or research partners have been able to help me. Some have even told me that I'm on a wild goose chase and should just drop it.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't just drop it. I am fascinated by the stories revolving these things and want to know more. It is quite possible that through the conquest of the Mexicha people that the words translated into something else. If you know, please tell me. I am desperate for assistance and to preserve my sanity.\n\nThese are the three terms that go hand in hand with one another: \n\"Tonal\" - the spirit/soul/essence of a person\n\"Nagual\" - the physical representation of the spirit/soul/essence of the person - usually takes the form of an animal\n\"Nagualli\" - a sorcerer/shaman/bruja/Curandera who interacts with the Nagual to heal the Tonal in times of sickness, injury, and misfortune\n\nOther variations include: \"naguales\"/\"nanahualtin\"/\"nahual\"/\"tonalli\"/\"tetonaltiani\"/\"naualteteuctin\"/\"nahuallotl\" \nConsidering the very close similarities to the spellings and the meanings of these roots, it's possible that in some books the sorcerer or magician or witch or whatever you call them is \"Nah-Wa-Li\" in pronunciation but could be just about anything in spelling. Hooray for poorly converted/translated languages!\n\nNow, I've only been able to find a sentence or a paragraph about each of these things. Every professor I've asked about this either doesn't know what the heck I'm talking about or refers me to one of the Codices (specifically the Florentine Codex, Borgia Codex, and the Mendoza Codex). \n\nWhile I do have access to scanned copies of these documents, I do not read Spanish very well (which has been pointed out to me numerous times as a MASSIVE disadvantage when it comes to researching this field and BELIEVE ME I'm working on it and I'm working on Nahuatl as well) and despite the plethora of books available to me through school and online sources, I've only found translations into English for the Codex Florentine. The others I would have to buy. Unfortunately I don't have the money to buy every single book I need access to. :( \n\nAnyway. My question is (after much rambling) have you also seen these terms? Do you know if they were translated into something different and are hiding incognito under a blanket of colloquialisms? Do you have any books I might be able to access about this? Do you know of anyone I might be able to speak to in person (or Via Skype or Email) about this? \n\nQuestion asked and terms defined, let me point out my primary sources so far that have provided me with even a shred of information: \n\"Nagualism: a Study of Native American Folklore and History\" by Daniel G. Brinton\n\"War of Witches\"  by Timothy Knab \n\"Religions of MesoAmerica\" by David Carrasco\n\"The Aztecs\" by Nigel Davies\n\"The Flayed God\" by Roberta &amp; Peter Markman\n\"Nagual\" from the Mexico Unexplained Podcast\n\"Nagual\"/\"tonal\"/\"nagualli\" from Wikipedia (gotta through the good ol' Wiki in there)\n\"Aztecs\" by Richard Townsend \n\"The Aztecs: New Prespectives\" by Dirk Van Tuerenhoust\n\nSorry for the long rant. I am literally throwing everything I know out there in hopes something will click with someone and they can help me out. \n\nBest,\nSylvr",

I found myself asking why early humans traveled eastwards so much sooner than eventual ventures north.\n\nI immediately guessed at the Bosporus serving as a barrier, but it seems geologists can still only guess at its age.  Some estimates suggest it would have been formed some 40,000 years *after* humans entered Europe, but other estimates suggest it is older than that.  \n\nCould it have been climate?  Was Anatolia treacherous to navigate 45,000+ years ago?  I wondered if it might have been due to complications of the last glacial period, but the last glacial maximum is placed at a date some 24,000 years *after* the suggested entry date of humans into Europe.

        "text": "I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but here we go: Anthropology is the study of humanity as a whole (got that from the side-bar), and recently I realized that many post-apocalyptic series try to make statements on humanity as a whole, and how human beings would function in situations where they had to, essentially, rebuild society from scratch. And I realized, this is something humanity has already done. Cultures don't just appear out of nowhere; all around the world people built societies from scratch. But do we actually know how cultures have adapted to apocalypses? \n\nDo we actually have any idea how a civilization would react if it was suddenly forced to 'go back a few steps' (e.g a large farming society suddenly forced to splinter back into several smaller bands of hunter gatherers)?\n\nThe Walking Dead asserts that, for modern society, being forced to 'go back' would result in a lawless wasteland, from which large organized settlements would only emerge after a long time and even then, those large settlements would quickly reinvent war. Essentially a big slide back into hunter gatherer societies, before a quick build up into what is essentially city-states. \n\nRevolution is a bit more optimistic and instead posits that the world would devolve into small agrarian settlements ruled over by militias; essentially a quick reinvention of feudalism.\n\nEssentially, if modern technology failed tomorrow, and then some threat actually killed 85% of the population, is there anyway to predict how human society would adapt? Have similar events happened in the past and, if they did, how long did it take those respective societies to climb back up to where they were before? If a farming society broke down into bands of hunter gatherers, how long before built back into farmers (if it was a sudden external force that caused the change, not any intrinsic socioeconomic factors).\n\nAnd if an apocalyptic scenario were to occur to modern society tomorrow, is there any historical basis we can use to predict how far back modern societies would slip and how long they would stay there, and/or what kind of societies they would build?\n\n",

According to my sources, they were usually made with red ochre and sturgeon glue or animal fat.  Supposedly, some are hundreds of years old, although I'm not seeing how that date is derived.\n\nWhile there are numerous examples of pictographs found in both Quetico and Boundary Waters (around 4 or 5 dozen or so), it's also a region of around 3,500 square miles that's been continually inhabited for thousands of years, as far as we know.  Fur traders noted numerous villages in the region.  Even if creation of the pictographs was limited to one individual in the village who created only one pictograph during their life, a back of the napkin calculation indicates there should be far more.\n\nSo what am I missing?  Do the ones we see reflect only a fraction of those made, and exposure/ differences in composition/action by other people cause the rest to vanish?\n\nWhat's also very strange is that in all of the BWCA and Quetico region, there's only one know petroglyph (rock carving).  Presumably they'd be more durable than pictographs, but there's only one.",

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nMy question tackles the idea of polyphonic music and the origin of advanced musical techniques in non-Western cultures. Those who study medieval European music will know that the introduction of multiple tones changed the nature of the music. The earliest historical document for this is the *Musica enchiriadis* which describes specific techniques for the implementation of polyphony in music.\n\nWhen I started looking into how it was that non-European cultures came to use polyphony in their music, I found that an often quoted theory is that musical harmony came from sources like the *Musica enchiriadis*, out of Europe and into other cultures. No multiple discovery, nor any elaboration on when these techniques may have arrived elsewhere.\n\nTo me this seems a bit of a strange leap. I highly doubt that polyphony was first invented and codified in writing with people sitting in a room thinking up the mathematics, ergo why this is an anthropological question and not a historical one. Is it so inconceivable that people could have been figuring out the concepts of polyphony by merely humming or whistling different tones to each other? There's nothing specific about polyphony that demands that a full musical key must be developed for it to be declared polyphonic.\n\nNow I will admit that this question is a bit muddled in academic debate. As far as I know, things like drone music aren't counted as polyphony by scholars who use a more rigid, Western definition. There are, as far as I know, drone instruments that predate texts on polyphony and with some critical thinking we can deduce that those did not solely play monophonic music. I imagine that there is some evidence of older music with a tonic being implied that would supercede European texts as being polyphonic in this case.\n\nTL;DR: Did polyphonic music exist in other cultures before the introduction of European musical structures and styles?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, first time using reddit! :)\n\nYou can feel free to point any error in my speech, maybe im taking wrong information in consideration. Just be open minded to my idea! :D\n\nI've been really interested in anthropology. One aspect of our history that blows my mind is the Cognitive Revolution. The Late Upper Paleolithic Model, or Upper Paleolithic Revolution, refers to the idea that, though anatomically modern humans first appear around 150,000 years ago, they were not cognitively or behaviorally \"modern\" until around 50,000 years ago. Thats the reason it was a \"revolution\": suddenly, ~50.000 years ago, there was a boom in inovation in tools, culture, language, art, hunting, etc and that also led to Homo Sapiens spread from Africa to the hole planet. As I've read on the book \"Sapiens: a brief story of mankind\", science knows very little about what led to the revolution, and one of the most accepted theorys is that it was due to a few, but crucial, gene mutations that shaped our brains to make Homo Sapiens behave as we do today (advanced language, music, dance, rituals, effective cooperation even in large groups, abstract thinking, etc). For me, it really feels weird to think that a few gene mutation is what was missing in Homo Sapiens brains (that was going through a long evolution process since the beggining of the Homo genre (completly animal-like conscious being) to us nowadays (animals with language and culture) ). to behave modernly.\n\nMany people like to compare our brains to computers, and thats what im going to do. Every animal have its brain (computer). It's evident that humans are animals with a very unique brain. Lets say its a computer with many and many specific pieces and processors interconnected in a real complex way that make humans do all this increadible things other animals cant. Lets point cognitive revolution happened 50.000 years ago. Thats to say that, 51.000 years ago, sapiens computers was really really different than 50.000 years ago. Maybe it was lacking just one cable to connect important parts and make the computer work its new increadible features? And then the gene mutations happened, this cable was birth and humans started thinking and doing things such as shamanism and rituals? I cant buy this idea. Before cognitive revolution, our brain was much more like is today than it was like other animal's brain, but our behaviour not. A very little change in brain to a big different change in behaviour.\n\nI think evolution took thousands of years to make a human with a brain capable of behave modernly, this brain was \"ready\" when Homo Sapiens arrived and evoluted a little bit (Homo Sapiens arived 200.000 years ago, but they were anatomically modern some thousands of years later - before the cognitive revolution) and then something else (maybe something at a conscious level  not at a gene level) had to happen to trigger the change in consciousness of this animal.\n\nFor a long time, even before the arising of the Homo genre, earth was fulled with many psychoative plants. Psilocybe mushrooms (aka magic mushrooms) are found naturally all over the planet, and its a very unique drug: it arises from the floor ready to use- pick them, eat, and you'll have a super profund sensorial experience. No cooking, smoking or preparation needed. There are another psychedelic mushrooms found naturally, and also many plants and cacti with this properties. Nature has a hole catallogue of \"nature occuring LSD's\" growing worldwide. From now on i'll just talk about psilocybe mushrooms because of its unique properties i've listed. (they're everywhere and ready to use).\n\nIm sure many animals have accidentaly ingested these mushroooms. Probably a hungry bear (just an example) once eated some of them, tripped balls for hours, got confused and if the trip didnt make him vulnerable to dangers and death, after some time it continued its bear life. I'm sure this happened many times with many animals.\n\nNow i'm talking about a specific animal that accidentally induced a mushroom trip because was hungry: an Homo Sapiens. An animal with a very unique brain, that evolution took some million years to develop after our split from other primates. A brain really like ours nowadays. But at that time, this animal wasnt much different from other animals. \n\nMy point is that... Maybe, Homo Sapiens were the first animals in this planet to understand the Psychedelic experience. Isn't curious all theese natural occuring psychedelic plants? Isn't weird why does the psychedelic experience exists? Maybe we will never find an evolutive advantage for the production of psilocybin in these mushrooms, and maybe it is not just an compound that leads to a funny and aleatory reaction when ingested. Maybe these substances were there just waiting to trigger an evolution in consciousness in a animal of this planet.  After cognitive revolution, human started, dancing, making music with instruments, rituals, and had the shaman (an expert in altered states of consciousness - including those induced by psychedelic plants) as the center figure).\n\nImagine some pre cognitive revolution Homo Sapiens hungry searching for food in the Savana. They find magic mushrooms, eat them and after some minutes they start tripping balls. Man, they're humans just like you and they've ate many magic mushrooms, you know what will happen - probably one of the most profund drug-induced experiences possible). Many shamanic culutres says that psychedelics leads to a contact with the divine - its instinctive for the human to feel what we call \"divine\" with these substances. One of the Sapiens hallucinates a increadible psychedelic face on a tree, and since this animal can make some different things (tools, fire and proto-language),it is capable of taking a sharp tool and dig the psychedelic face in the tree. The other sapiens, tripping balls, see's the psychedelic face drawn in the tree and recognize it as the same sort of thing as the hallucinations the mushrooms are inducing on them. Everybody's recognize the uniqueness of this art, and all of them starts \"believing in that god\". Now, on a conscious level, an evolution is triggered in these Sapiens. Later, they eat the mushrooms again, same thing happen and now they are going to praise to the gods that are appering in more complex ways. They start repeat drumming, they paint more psychedelic faces on the woods. Now, there's something different in the agenda of an earth animal: Psychedelic rituals. Finally, its understood why earth has mushrooms everywhere.\n\nMy english sucks and im not good on sharing my ideas. But I think this long text is enough for you all to understand my idea!\n\nI know Terrence McKenna has the stoned ape theory, that shares the ideia that Psilocybe mushrooms had a great role in the human consciousness evolution. But this theory talks more about the use of mushrooms in early periods of human evolution, not specific during the cognitive revolution.\n\nMushrooms are also known to be one of the most profund psychedelic in terms of changes in identity and stuff during the trip. It's induced ego death is really powerfull and unique, maybe it has some relation in terms of changing an animal consciousness to a consciousness with a stronger identity (the raise of the ego) and capable of understanding music, art, geometry and stuff.\n\nWhat do you think about all this stuff?\n\nThanks for the attention!!",

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nIf you were to google \"why do we kiss\" or \"why do we hug\" chances are you'll find an explanation along the line of \"it's an expression of love\" or \"it denotes affection\" or \"it signifies desire\" (in the case of a romantic kiss)\n\nMy question is, why is the explanation never phrased as a FULFILLMENT of love/desire rather than \"a sign of love/desire\"? To me, the way it's typically described always makes it seem like kissing is a gesture made in favor of the person being kissed, which I'm not necessarily in disagreement with, but is it not self-serving too? And if so, why is it never described in that light?\n\nIf I get the urge to kiss/hug my mom and do so, sure, it can be said that what I'm doing here is non-verbally communicating to my mom \"I love you\" to make her feel better, but why cannot it be said, that the urge to kiss her signifies a personal need for intimacy, and that by kissing her, I am fulfilling and gratifying that need? And if it can be said, then why is it often not?\n\nI was directed to post my questions to this subreddit, so I hope to find my answers here. :)",

Was the potlatch a mode of production?

Or how about the Tiv, who used three tiers of trade? Maybe it's all one big flux anyway?\n\nI also remember learning in my archaeology class that human societies typically fall into 4 categories, band, tribe, chiefdom, and state. Do these categories more or less hold up when we account for just about every group anthropologists encountered? I remember getting the impression as an anthropology undergrad that there was simply so many different types of society out there it was nearly impossible to categorize them all under a neat rubric like that.

The main island of Soqotra lies not far from the proposed southern migration route of anatomically modern humans out of Africa ∼60,000 years ago (kya), suggesting the island may harbor traces of that first dispersal. Nothing is known about the timing and origin of the first Soqotri settlers. The oldest historical visitors to the island in the 15th century reported only the presence of an ancient population. We collected samples throughout the island and analyzed mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal variation. We found little African influence among the indigenous people of the island. Although the island population likely experienced founder effects, links to the Arabian Peninsula or southwestern Asia can still be found. In comparison with datasets from neighboring regions, the Soqotri population shows evidence of long-term isolation and autochthonous evolution of several mitochondrial haplogroups. Specifically, we identified two high-frequency founder lineages that have not been detected in any other populations and classified them as a new R0a1a1 subclade. Recent expansion of the novel lineages is consistent with a Holocene settlement of the island ∼6 kya.

Nowadays they're called Modern South Arabians and not all of them are that Dark like the Hadhrami (Who speak Arabic instead of other South Arabian languages) and the Shehri probably due to admixture from other peoples (this is just speculation).\n\nEdit:\n\nYou can search قبيلة المهرة‎   , الناس مهرى and شعب سقطرى and  المهرة and اللغة السقطرية‎\n\nto see them on youtube and google  since the English results are limited\n\nEdit: The Al-Akhdam group I don't know if they are Afro-Arabs or a related group of South Arabians. There isn't a lot of information other than that they are a caste of \"Dark skin \" Yemenis who speak Arabic.\n\nEdit: I reposted the links",
