[Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. \n\n[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. \n\nI’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election. \n\nAsk me anything.\n\nPROOF: https://twitter.com/RichardRubinDC/status/1630245676427927552",
