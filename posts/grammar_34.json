Here's the sentence I typed:\n\n**\"Right now, what I'm appreciating the most about being at \\[School\\] is our daily visits to \\[Park\\].\"**\n\nIt's long and awkward to begin with, so I should probably find a way to rephrase. But my problem here is that \"is\". *What I like most* seems like it should be followed by \"is\", not \"are\", right? But it seems off to me. Help!",

        "text": "My significant other and I are having a heated argument about interpretation of an email. Recently, I went to the local florist and had them make up a large complex bouquet of roses. I wanted it in my own vase, so I brought that vase to the florist on a Friday morning for them to fill with the flower arrangement. I picked up the flowers about an hour later and brought them home to present to my spouse. After a few days, they began to wilt, and my spouse was unhappy with how quickly they were fading. So, six days after the purchase, she contacted the florist to complain that these flowers were not holding up well. The florist replied with this email:\n\nFlorist: (six days after picking up the flowers):\n\n***\"I have bound those together, so you should take them out and give them a fresh cut at a sharp angle and refill the vase all the way to the top. They are 6 days old today, I gaurentee my flowers for 5 - 7 days. It looks like some may have had a little water drip on them which is what makes the inner petal go bad like that on occasion. It is hard to police other patrons from dripping water on the roses sometimes. At any rate, I gaurentee my product, so I am sending a mixed arrangement with 3 colors of south american roses and other pretty flowers mixed in. All and all, I think that the first arrangement isn't doing to bad considering the various roses I had available to use, Garden roses, south american roses, and local domestic smaller headed roses.***\n\n***If possible also add some of the flower preservative to the water before you put the roses back after cutting them. I will send more preservative with the second arrangement.\"***\n\nUpon reading this, my spouse accused me of being the cause of the problem with the flowers not lasting. She believes strongly that the email means that I was instructed to, and should have immediately re-vased the arrangement with a fresh cut and fresh water as soon as I arrived home after picking up these flowers. I completely disagree, and believe that the message means is meant to inform me how the arrangement was constructed, and that I should \"now\" (six days after receiving the flowers) take them out of the vase, give them a fresh cut, and put in fresh water.\n\nI understand that, often, when purchasing flowers from this shop or that, one may not know how old they are, or how recently they have been given a fresh cut and fresh water. However, in this case, I knew that the flowers had been freshly cut and vased in fresh water within at most 1-2 hours of picking them up (because that is when I gave them my own vase to use). Furthermore, the florist gave me no instructions at time of pickup to re-vase the flowers. Indeed, it seems ridiculous to me that, after paying $140 for the florist making an arrangement in a vase that I provided, that I should be expected to go home and rebuild the bouquet again myself. That seems completely absurd to me.\n\nAnd indeed, the flowers DID last a good 5-7 days, just as the florist expected. So, in my opinion, there was no indication in anything that the florist said, to indicate that I was at fault for not re-vasing these flowers after picking them up.\n\nMy spouse thinks that the first sentence, ***\"I have bound those together, so you should take them out and give them a fresh cut at a sharp angle and refill the vase all the way to the top.\"*** meant that They were bound in such a way that I was supposed to have re-vased them immediately after pickup. I point out that the existence of the comma implies that this is not a cause and effect situation, but rather was an point of information (how the flowers were bunched), followed by instructions in the present (6 days after pickup) to recut and re-vase them in fresh water. My spouse claims the florist was using sloppy or poor grammar, and meant that they  were to be re-vased upon pickup. I take the email at its face, see no errors in grammar, and find all the conditionals and tenses (should instead of could, give instead of given, refill instead of refilled), as well as the specific context of the event (that the flowers were indeed freshly vased by the florist within 1-2 hours of pickup) are all consistent and very clear in their meaning that the florist's email is directing me to re-vase at the time of the email, 6 days after the pickup), not at the time of pickup.\n\nWe are both adamant in our views of this florist's email instructions. I'd appreciate some serious opinions from people who can see this entire situation in a dispassionate light that is logical and internally consistent with all the facts of the situation.\n\nThanks very much!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Hey all. Something I have been wondering about for awhile now is whether not not punctuation goes inside or outside the quotation marks when doing an in-text citation of another work wherein there is no punctuation present in the original. For example, let's say I am performing an analysis of [Whitman's \"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing\".](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/i-saw-louisiana-live-oak-growing-0) The first line of that poem ends with a comma. How would I punctuate the following statement?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first line of the poem is \"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the original, the line ends with a comma. However, the above statement is a declarative and ought to be punctuated with a period. So would it be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first line of the poem is \"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing\".\n\nor\n\nThe first line of the poem is \"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask this because, in the second one with the punctuation within the quotation marks, I am modifying the quote by the inclusion of my own punctuation and that doesn't feel right to me. The first one seems more correct as I am omitting the original punctuation  but signal I have added my own punctuation by having it outside of the quotation marks. But which is it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedited: format\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
