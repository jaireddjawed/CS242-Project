        "text": "My best friend recently moved in with my family and me. \nThe thing is, we spent 6.5 months apart after graduation. The entire time we were inseparable. But after graduation she got into a relationship, and we stopped talking. Completely.\n\nI remember a few nights before graduation we were crying on the ground saying how we’ve never had a relationship this deep before. How lucky we were to be soul sisters. We wore necklaces with on another’s initials. We were best friends for four years. We loved each other.\n\nAnd then we graduated. We moved back in with our families. And she fell in love with a girl at her job. She started talking to her more. Me less. I saw on her Snapchat stories that she stopped wearing the necklace with my initial. She barely reached out when my town was hit by Hurricane Ian. It felt bad but I assumed once we moved back in everything would be okay. Surely it was just our friendship being long distance…\n\nPicking her up at the airport to move in with me felt like picking up a stranger. I didn’t know how to talk to her. The car ride home was awkward. She was nice but the conversation was stiff.\n\nThree months have passed. It hasn’t gotten much better. We barely exchange words with one another. I’ll say something and she’ll respond “mmhmm”. She doesn’t laugh at my jokes. When we were in college she’d always laugh. She criticizes me more. Conversations feel monotone. When she’s nice, it’s emotionally distant. It doesn’t feel like love, it just feels like politeness. I hope that makes sense. \n\nIt’s hard not to resent her sometimes. I just keep waiting for things to go back to normal. But after nearly three months, a 1/4 of a year, I don’t think they ever will. I have more of an emotional connection to my coworkers. I laugh with them. I know more about their lives. They talk to me more. I don’t feel on edge around them.\n\nIt’s a long story but we had plans to get married. She told me a few days ago that she plans on marrying her girlfriend instead. She mentioned it casually, which was very jarring for me. I was preparing for a uphill legal battle, shit we even talked to a lawyer about our plans to get married, only for her to say last week “well me and (girlfriend) are going to be married”. I’m not upset we won’t get married, I’m relieved actually. I’m just so shocked that it came out of nowhere. This was something we’d talk about for the last year and a half. We meticulously planned it out. We were telling our closet mutual friends and families.\n\nAnd suddenly a “oh yeah, nevermind”\n\nI don’t know what I am to her. Certainly not a fiancée, hahaha. I hardly feel like a best friend. I barely feel like a friend. \n\nMaybe an acquaintance \n\nBut she’s moving in with me to grad school and her girlfriend is moving in too. They look for apartments near the schools I’ve submitted applications to. \n\nI still have yet to meet her girlfriend. I hear them FaceTime every night. But she’s never introduced me. I hear them listening to Rihanna’s half time show together right now. I hear her laughing. We just watched a show together and all I got was “mmmhm”s.\n\nI’m moving in with a stranger… make that two strangers.  \n\nTonight is a hard night",

A few times, my little bastards have knocked down glass. Once they knocked down a whole shelf and broke a snow globe, scattering glass all over the carpet. I tried my best to pick up the glass but eventually gave in and used a handheld vacuum around midnight. Another time was a wine glass off the counter at 3 am and something I can’t remember a different day at 10pm. I don’t use glasses anymore and have secured all of my shelves, but those few times I have vacuumed late at night still eat at me.",

If I want to hang out with friends it has to be at my house and they have to be girls. If I do get to go out it's really rare and they have to know my friend's parents and friend and I have to be home by 6:30. They have two apps to track my phone I'm not even joking and if I do get a car they're going to be tracking that too. They also look through my phone in room almost every 5 days sometimes even more.\n\nSo basically what I do is I sneak out of my bedroom window and I go to parties and I go hang out with my girlfriend. Or when they leave me home alone I go out and do things but it's normally for when they go on business trips and they're gone for like 3 days. And also I got my ears pierced without them knowing",

They kept him in a box outside with small enclosure surrounding it. I can’t remember what time of the year this was but I grew up in a hot climate area at the time so it seemed cruel to me to leave him outside. \n\nA few days later, I walked to her house to ask her if she wanted to play. Before I knocked on her door, lo and behold, I saw in the bushes right in front of her house her guinea pig. I decided now was the time to make my move. I snatched the guinea pig and ran back home. I mean with their set up, they shouldn’t have been surprised that he escaped. So in my vigilante 7-year old mind, it was destiny. \n\nI told my family that when I was walking I saw the guinea pig outside, which was true. I just left out that it was in front of my friends house where she has shown it to me just days prior. Anyways my parents believed I just found this guinea pig (I did not live in an area where it’s normal to just find guinea pigs outside). They let me keep it, and I christened him Mr. Pickles. \n\nIdiot me, invited that same friend over to my house to show her my “new” guinea pig, which we kept in a proper cage inside. For some reason, she left shortly after, seemingly upset, and didn’t want to hang out with me anymore. I lost a friend that day, but I gained a guinea pig. \n\nMr. Pickles ended up living for 4 years after that. I’d like to think I gave him a better life. Two decades later, and my family still doesn’t know the true origins of Mr. Pickles.",

        "text": "Probably a long backstory... my mother has always tried to paint me as the bad guy. This is to the point that she has told me and everyone else my whole life that I was bad since before I was born (I was far more active in utero than my brother) and have always been \"bad\". What it boiled down to was that I had adhd, but then also eventually suffered severe depression and anxiety due to never being accepted by HER. My brother could do no wrong, but I was always a nuisance to her. She used to cart me to therapists trying so hard to prove I was as bad as she claimed, but reports many pages long state that I was just sad and broken and needed encouragement and appropriate socialization. She has never once encouraged me and has actually LIED about me and threw me under the bus when I was 7. She became obsessive with her boyfriend at the time to the point that he broke it off with her, and she blamed the breakup on me (to our family) saying I was so bad he couldn't be around me. But she didn't realize at the time that her bf and my uncle knew each other personally and he told my uncle the real reason for the breakup, that I had literally nothing to do with it and that he thought I was a really good kid. I remember being a good kid, I used to help animals and help elderly people in my neighborhood with their yard work. All I wanted was their company as it was lonely feeling unwanted at home. It was nice not having someone yell at and belittle me.\n\nFast forward though several more depressing years, even though my mom has always made me feel less than, I had always maintained a relationship, always tried to do for her and help her. Meanwhile, my brother up on a pedestal has failed her over and over and yet he can still do no wrong. His 2 kids have no idea who she is because he doesnt take them to see her, and they are now both teenagers. I have taken her to lunch or dinner on multiple occasions, given her gift cards, bought her shoes and clothes, taken her clothes to the laundry mat. I have tried my best to make her feel like she had someone there for her even though it definitely wasn't a two way street. I have had some pretty low points that I was dumb enough to call her thinking I would feel better but she just made me feel worse. She is happiest when I do for her and spend money on her, and if I'm not, then she is extremely indifferent. \n\nWell last April my mom suffered a severe stroke, like really severe. She is completely bedridden, no control over her bladder and bowels, no use of right side of her body, has a permanent feeding tube, can't communicate. She only recently started talking out loud but makes no sense whatsoever. She also has large memory lapses and spends most of her time zoned out on TV and oblivious (for the most part) of her situation. \n\nIn talking to the same uncle mentioned earlier, a couple things came out that I can't shake. He didn't tell me these things to stab her in the back, they just came out in conversation and I eventually put the pieces together and reconfirmed details with him. The first thing is that apparently my mom had led the family to believe I never even came to see her, much less did anything for her. The last example of this is only A WEEK prior to her stroke, I visited (she lives 2 hours from me one way) and while I was there she asked me to rearrange her living room, which I did. Well when I told my uncle about how I felt glad I was able to do this one last guesture for her and that my last visit with her was a memory I can feel good about... he told me the truth. Apparently she had called him later that same day after I left, and just as most people ask, he asked her what she was up to. She told him \"oh nothing, just got done switching my living room around\" not only taking credit, but completely leaving out that I had even visited her. This conversation is what really unraveled everything, he was led to believe that I never visited etc which is a flat out LIE. \n\nAs bad as that one stung, this next one hurts deeper. My mom had always talked about a lake she went to in the summers as a kid with her cousins, was her best memories apparently. She always talked about it so a couple years ago I surprised her by offering to take her across a few states to stay there for a weekend, where I would pay for hotel and food and all she would have to do is have a good time and revisit somewhere she loved. She immediately told me she couldn't because her body is so old and stiff that she can't do long car rides anymore. I felt bad for her failing body and also felt bad for offering. Well come to find out, she had asked my uncle to go after that, saying all the same things I said to her. That she would pay and DRIVE. She has always had a crush on my uncle and when my aunt died 5 years ago, she has been trying to insert herself into his life ever since, even tried to move in with him etc. \n\nI am an INFJ and normally have no problems cutting people from my life. SNIP bye-bye 👋 but it has been so much harder to do this to my mom. She always has and continues to hurt me so deep, I almost feel like she wouldn't be happy until I was in the ground before her. That's not depression talking, that's the raw feeling she has left me with. And yet I STILL go and do for her. I feel bad for the situation she is in and when I put myself in her shoes (easy for INFJ) I can see how she just needs someone right now. But after years of widdling me down, and realizing over the last year just how little I am appreciated, I've been showing up less and less. I still do for her, trying to make her misery better (bringing her sweet tea, food when she was attempting to eat, recently got her a new TV) but it feels so awkward to be sitting there with her. Her hand is the last one I want to hold but she hardly gets any visitors. \n\nSome say they don't blame me and others try to guilt me with \"she is the only mother you have, appreciate having her now before she is gone\" but I have already lost my father. I know exactly what it feels to lose someone that close, the difference is my dad never made me feel like she has.",

Who knows. I used to steal in previous jobs and got fired, rightfully so. I thought my mental health was getting better since I live in a dream home and town with the love of my life. Turns out, mental illness follows. \n\nI haven't stolen anything in a long time. But when I do, I know my mental health is getting worse. I have intrusive thoughts about crashing the car so I don't have to go to work. I like my job. I like my coworkers. They make it worth it. I'm fairly new also but have been praised for what I have done so far. \n\nThose aren't excuses, but I suppose mental illness causes one to steal right?",
