        "text": "Hi everyone one. I’ve been dating this guy for 3 months now. Things between me and him have gone very fast. We dated for 3 weeks before becoming exclusive. I’m his first girlfriend, but he’s my third boyfriend. \nHe never had a dating experience. \n\nHe told me he was sorry if it was scary, but he told me he loved me and that it didn’t bothered him if I didn’t feel the same. I didn’t know if I felt the same, but I said it back. We met each others parents. He is very loving and caring. He baby talks with me, and exposes me proudly to everyone he knows. However, something surprised me since I met him. He wants to see me really often, like 3-4 times a week. I never initiate and he always does.   We live in south america so we just finished our summer break. We’re preparing for our college years. He also texts me everyday, and every hour. My friends say that this is normal but I don’t know. I don’t have the need to see him more than once per week, and 5-10 texts per day for me is fine. He really asks for a lot of attention. \n\nI’m asking myself if he’s possessive because of some things that happened. \nFirst of all, I went to a party the other day without him with my friends. He took me there and went back to his house. We use to text, even when with friends or when we go out. That night, I got wasted. I drank really much and got really sick. My friend took my phone and answered his text messages as he was getting a bit worried. \n\nThe next day, when I texted him back, he got a bit mad, and said that he was worried and didn’t underhand why I felt the need to get so wasted. I told him he was overreacting and it wasn’t such a big deal. He said that it was unfair to him and needed 2-3 hours of space to cool down a bit. I got upset and I was scared that he would leave me so I called him but he didn’t answer. After 2 hours, he saw I was upset so he took me to his home and took care of my hangover state. He was a bit mad because he said he didn’t understand why i felt the need to get so wasted. So i cried in his arms and told him i was scared that he would break up with me. He reassured me. Some friends said he was overreacting, so ai don’t know if he was in the right. \n\nFast forward two weeks, I left him on delivered for 2 hours because I was with my family. Our college years would start the next week. When I came back, he was upset that i didn’t answer him. As he was with a friend, i got upset too and accused him of being with his friend. Long story short, we fought all night like kids. Next day, we both apologized and he said it was stupid form him to get angry over a stupid text. Next day he got mad again over a petty thing, and he made me cry. He really apologized and asked me to tell him what i would like to change in our relationship so i could be happier. I don’t know why i didn’t tell him anything. \n\nThe rest of the week, I haven’t been able to answer his texts in a quick manner. He understood that and never got mad again, even reassuring me when i was apologizing for late replies. But i can’t get over the fact he got mad over this last time. Every time he is on delivered, i am stressed because of his reaction last time. \n\nI’m getting a bit distant and i’m feeling him a bit worried but he tries to keep contact with me. I feel pressured by him. \n\nI compared my relationship with my bestfriend’s and it’s not normal. They see each other less and never got into an argument. She tells me he might be toxic and possessive, and she seems right.  \n\nI try to make him understand i need space but he never gets it. He always try to be with me when he has some free time or when he isn’t seeing his friends, but that stresses me. He is also a bit insecure from past experiences so i show him a lot of love and it is getting exhausting. \n\nI’m about to start my college experience and don’t want him to control me and prohibit me to do new things and enjoy my youth. \n\nI cancelled plans with him 2 times to be with some new people i’ve met and he got upset about it. \n\nIs my boyfriend showing possessive behavior ? Are all of these red flags ? Should i leave him ?\n\nTL;DR : My new boyfriend is pressuring me and i think he might be toxic.",

Most chores are divided evenly and when it comes to doing the dishes, I do one day then she does the next etc. This worked fine for a while especially since we both seemed to cook around 50% of the time.\n\nI started working from home a few months ago and my gf is now working slightly later shifts. This means for 4-5 days during the week, I tend to be the one doing all of the cooking and every other day I'll be doing all the dishes on top of that. I spoke to my gf about maybe her doing the dishes during the week since I'm the one doing all the cooking then on a weekend I'll do them.\n\nShe refused and said it was unfair to change how we're doing things. I pointed out we've changed how the cooking is divided now because of our change in work situations so surely the dishes should change aswell. She again refused and said it sounded like I was just trying to get out of doing my share of the chores. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?\n\ntl;dr my gf got annoyed that I wanted to change how ew divide some chores since I'm doing more of the cooking. Does anyone have any advice?",

        "text": "I am (24f) almost 25 my brother is (19M) and my sister is (16F) Growing up I wouldn't say I had an abusive or bad childhood necessarily but I had the single mother that couldn't afford much and spent a third of her day out on the porch smoking then later, the stepdad that had anger issues and probably wasn't ready to be a dad yet.\n\nI grew up with them, always frustrated about us kids, bills, and work pretty much right up until a year or two before I moved out. Always yelling and punishing. Sometimes throwing things or putting holes in doors and more yelling. My stepdad didn't have a grasp on how to show affection because his dad rarely did, and my mother was rarely ever touchy feely for more than a minute. \n\nI had to babysit alot even though i was no where near emotionally prepared to parent two younger siblings i was easily frustrated and mean as a result as a kid when watching them because they were a handful and they never let me live it down to this day i hear about it every time i see them that i was so mean while babysitting and ill probably drown my own kids one day. We didn't go out much as a family, and the reason was always because we never got along or didn't have any money or any time. \n\nBy the time I left, my siblings had a patient and well practiced, helpful, and more affectionate father figure that actually says I love you first and calls and texts to ask about your day. They had a more present, smoke free, less stressed out and also more affectionate mother who found herself and happiness in her hobbies and didn't spend half of her time trying to convince them to lose weight like she did with me (they are both very thin). They were buying campers and going out weekly camping kayaking, hiking and taking trips to visit other states, buying matching jackets, and having family nights every week. \n\nIt feels like since I left, they have had more experiences together and fun in the last 7 years than I did in 18. My siblings were too young to even realize how much it changed. \n\nMy siblings grew up and are very close friends, always posting pictures together and talking daily very rarely, posting anything involving me in comparison. I have tried my best to go above and beyond with birthdays and Christmases in the most thoughtful ways possible, spending hours trying to find the one thing they mentioned they are really into months ago to show that i care. I put effort into being interested in things that are important to them and being kind and affectionate, but i can never outrun or apologize enough for how things were when i was young and didn't know how to deal with two younger kids all the time and they dont listen when i try to explain that i was a kid too. \n\nMy parents tell me they are so proud of me, but I was just so \"difficult\" growing up, so it was just harder back then with 3 kids.\n\nAre there any other oldest siblings who feel like they grew up with totally different parents and find themselves jealous of their siblings? How do you deal with that anger? The feeling of unfairness? Or if you have stories of how you feel your parents were different when you grew up vs. when your siblings did, I'd enjoy reading that too. \n\nTLDR: Oldest sibling frustration from the total difference in the types of parents you grew up with vs. your siblings.",

        "text": "My (27F) partner (28M) of 7 years are likely breaking up. I am 8 months pregnant with baby number 3.\n\nTL;DR: I am currently pregnant with baby number 3 and my partner believes he has fallen out of love with me and wants to separate, and says I deserve better.  But I have been invalidating his feelings towards me for sometime now and making him feel as though he hasn’t been enough for his family.  But I’m wrong and I’ve only been lashing out at him from fear of having 3 kids under 3.  I want to save our relationship.\n\nI (27F) have been together with my partner (28M) for nearly 7 years, engaged for 4.  After we got engaged we bought our first home and a year later fell pregnant with our son who is almost 3.  And then had a second son who is 16 months.  And by surprise I fell pregnant again and am now currently 8 months pregnant.  \nLately I have been overwhelmed with the thought of having 3 under 3 that I have been nesting like crazy since January hit.  And I have been desiring so much more attention from my partner, i have planned multiple days together for us to have all while he’s been working long stressful hours and ignored his need for personal time.  I’ve been trying to force him to help me with these big projects of mine while he has his own that he wants to do.  But I felt they weren’t as important.\nHe holds a high position in retail that causes him to work long hours at times and is often working from home after his long days.  His stress level has been at an ultimate high.  \nSince having our first child, he was receiving promotion after promotion.  He’s had a new title every year it seems.  And we sold our first house after just two years to move closer to his new work.  We found a beautiful home.  And now he moved again and his commute is an hour there and back.\nI became a SAHM after our second was born.  So I have been out of work for a year and a half now.  Through this time I have been dealing with a lot of emotions and identity crisis that I just didn’t know how to control.  I kept putting blame on everything around me.  Our pets, our kids, motherhood, and the worst blame was my partner.  I allowed these TikTok’s to make me believe that my partner was never enough.  And I constantly brought up fights and questioned his love towards me.  That he was never trying. He was always reassuring me otherwise and I still denied him.  I envied his life because I felt he had it far easier.\nAnd now our last few fights have turned into a very likely break up and it has caused me the greatest pain I’ve ever felt to think of losing this wonderful man who I have been hurting for so long.  I blamed him for my depression and ultimately shamed him for who he is as a person.  Instead of focusing on myself, I expected him to somehow fix me.  He believes that he has fallen out of love with me and that I deserve better.  He told me he would always make sure the kids and I were taken care of and that he’d give me anything.  He said he doesn’t think he’s someone who could ever be happy with anyone.  He told me I wasn’t to blame and I was absolutely perfect.  \nBut I haven’t been perfect.  I’ve only been a good nurturer to him, but I invalidated his emotions and failed to recognize his own struggles as a working father and provider. I’ve been selfish and a poor communicator.  \nHe said he’s not going anywhere for now as he wants to be there for the birth of our child and to support me for the time after. And I’ve been spiraling out of control for the past week that this has happened.  I need advice on how I can save our relationship.  I have caused him so much pain.  \nHis family insist I focus on myself and give him time and continue to be the person I am.  That if I push it he’s going to further shut down.  His whole family said they are praying for us and are all very sad to see us going through this. And I’m trying so hard.  But I’ve been so tempted to beg for forgiveness.  I don’t want to lose him.",

        "text": " So, I am a female (24) and my BF is a male (24). The story goes like this, on my BF's b-day, we had some friends over (a she and a him). Prior to this, my BF asked me if I was okay with them staying over in our apt for a day, while we were out of town (we had to leave to celebrate his b-day in our hometown). The couple was also from another part of the country so they had to stay a few days more. Since we were leaving and the apt was empty, he decided that it was ok to let them stay over for one day (bcs they did not have accomodation for that specific Sunday). I was not ok with this (leaving the people there while we were gone). Because I threw a tantrum, and I said, definetly no, I was not allowing this, he decided to give them the keys behind my back, I found out and we fought. He said, that he is sorry that he lied to me, but he is not sorry for letting them stay over, because it was an urgent situation and he did not think that it was such a big deal. I am blowing this out of proportion, am I being gaslighted? We did not speak for three weeks, until I initiated contact (we live togheter), and yesterday I initated a talk abt the situation. He said that he wasn't ready for the conversation, but since I initiated, he talked. Idk how to feel about him now.   \n\n\nTLDR: My BF goes behind my back by giving the keys to our apt to his friends when I did not agree to that.",

        "text": "I just found out yesterday as I was looking through his phone that he had a conversation last month (up until last week) with a girl telling her to come over to his house since his parents weren't there and they could do anything they want. They didn't actually see each other because the girl was busy and ghosted him afterwards. This was the time when we had bad fights and told me he was depressed. But in turns out that he wanted a girl over to his house.\n\nI was shattered to pieces upon reading this so I confronted him. But before I even told him what was wrong, he instantly knew what I was talking about. He immediately said sorry but then he said that his intention was to just have drinks and watch Netflix with the girl, it wasn't sex. I kept on telling him that it was already cheating, then he said \"if that's cheating to you then it's cheating.\" I told him that day that we were done. But he still tried to contact me after and told me he was sorry and that he doesn't want to lose me. He'll do anything to gain my trust back. I told him countless times that I was done, that I'll never love and trust him the same way again, especially that he never mentioned that girl to me and about him inviting her over. If I didn't look through his phone, I would never know he did that to me. \n\nI'm just so depressed and still can't stop crying. I love him and I miss him, but I know he hurt me badly and my friends keep telling me not to bring him back to my life. He told me he'll wait for me even though I repeatedly told him that I won't come back. He asked me for one last chance to get things right and to learn how to love me deeper. Is it worth it to give him one last chance? What do I do?\n\nTL;DR: my bf invited a girl to house when he was at his hometown. Is it cheating? Is it worth it to stay? He begged me to give him one last chance.",

Last weekend we were out drinking and I made a pretty dry/unfunny joke about not wanting to move in (which I 100% meant as a joke and even clarified about a second later, yet she took it seriously). 5 days later, she calls and says she’s really sorry but to her I wasn’t joking and she says her guts telling her that moving in this early is a bad mistake (her last 2 relationships went to shit after the bf moved in, so it’s a big insecurity for her). She apologised and said she still loves me and wants to be with me, but she has to be honest and what I said planted a seed of doubt.\n\nI’m so upset and angry at the whole situation. I love this girl and was really excited to move in, I’m angry at myself for even drunkenly joking about that, I’m angry at her for waiting so late to tell me (I’ve already started packing and have signed all paperwork), and I was genuinely excited to move out of my parents home so the whole thing has really got to me. I live in the middle of no where too so was excited to live in a proper town so I could start my gym routine, start cooking for myself etc.\n\nI explained to her last night that I understand why, I apologised and said obviously i can understand why she feels that way and that even though I was joking, I shouldn’t have said it.\n\nI’ve slept on it and I feel so miserable. I don’t know how to act because i still feel so sad/angry/hopeless about everything now. Even the thought of messaging her makes me upset. I just don’t know what to do or what to say. Any advice would be great.\n\nTldr; jokingly my girlfriend I didn’t want to live with her anymore when we were out drinking and even after immediately telling her that I was joking, who has taken it seriously and now wants to cancel my move-in to hers in 2 days.",

Which is to say we’ve spent most weekends together, seen each other regularly throughout the week, gone away on trips together, texted every day, met each other’s friends, and had pretty serious conversations about the future, etc. He said he deleted all his apps after he met me (I did not ask him to do this) and I hadn’t been seeing anyone other than him.\n\nThe only reason I never pushed a relationship was because I had come out of a five year relationship less than a year before we started dating. He said he wasn’t ready to commit as he was in a relationship for most of his twenties that didn’t work out.\n\nIt turns out he never ended this relationship and has a long distance girlfriend. She lives in a different country but is coming to see him and they’re going on a family holiday with his parents next week. He told me this and said he felt bad but that as we weren’t exclusive, he hoped I’d understand.\n\nI broke up with him immediately and have been doing no contact since (about a week ago). But honestly, it’s hard. I still have lingering feelings for him and can’t work out what to do. I didn’t want to end things and I find myself wishing that he had just kept lying to me so we could have kept having fun. He said that he hoped we could be friends and I can’t help clinging onto that hope even though I know that I’m better off without him. I keep cycling between feelings of anger and sadness but I really just miss him. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do or how to move on. Is it worth trying to stay friends or should I just burn all bridges and reach out to his girlfriend?\n\nTl;dr Guy I was seeing non-exclusively for six months had a serious girlfriend the whole time. Feeling blindsided and angry, but also too attached to let him go. Trying to go no contact but could use advice on how to move on properly.",

I got her number and talked a bit over text, and facetimed. We decided to have a little impromptu hangout later that night\n\nI went over her place around 9:15p. We talked on the couch for a bit, I jokingly made fun of how small her tv was and she said I should see the one in her bedroom. (it was literally 19 inches  - smaller than a monitor, mounted on the wall haha)\n\nFrom there it pretty much led right into sex. The sex was great. I took my time and made sure I made a good first impression \n\nWe hung out all night until 4:30a, talking, cuddling and joking around. I thought it went great. I actually really liked her personality and could see myself dating her. \n\nIn bed, I mentioned that I had a great time. Upon leaving, she told me to text her when I got home. I didn’t, I honestly just forgot. \n\nAnyways I was scrolling through bumble the next night (late, probably around 2a) and I saw her account was deleted. Not gonna lie I freaked out a bit and decided to text her “hey” to follow up, even tho it was late. she read it the following morning around 9a\n\nWas she just using me for sex?

My two year relationship ended in December and I can confidently say I’m over him, so I’m ready to try and connect with someone again. At first I was over him but wasn’t ready for another relationship, and I just wanted someone to talk to. But now I’m ready to build a connection. I want to do it the “right way”. \n\nI’m worried about becoming obsessed again and moving too fast. I’m a very monogamous person, but I recognize that keeping my options open will help me not to settle for the first person I admire. Is there any other advice I can follow to keep a good, natural pace with someone that I am interested in forming a romantic relationship with? For context, this is referring to dating-app-based dating. \n\nI’m attracted to someone [25M] (trying to use correct terms to pace myself, “attracted” as opposed to “like”) but it’s been like TWO DAYS. I’m worried if I’m too distant that I’ll appear uninterested and they’ll move on. What’s a good balance?",

I saw the situation and it's not good. My parents would step in but my dad is going through chemo and can't travel.\nNo one can reason with my aunt.

I want to help but I don't know where to start as I feel like it's also not my place.

At this time, I started to think that I didn't really love the guy I was into before, I started to consider him as a really close friend (and let's call him S.) and I really started to like my ex in a romantic point of view, so I made me feel awful, and he made me cry or think about death several times (I'm a very dramatic and irrational person when I'm on stressful things like that)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 weeks ago, I wanted to make a break because I just couldn't continue with him. He sent me many messages to tell me I'm the wife of his life, that he couldn't continue with me, that kind of stuff. I also learn that he talked with S, about how I was and stuff. I stopped the break since I was as bad as before, and I loved him (and I didn't think at all).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo like 2 weeks ago, I talked with a friend of mine \\[17F\\] (who is a friend of him too) and a good friend of him \\[20F I guess\\], because I was really depressed about him. His close friend talked to him, and he didn't make any crisis for like one week, Ig ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I keep saying to him that although I have feeling for him, I DO NOT want to experience any kind of romantic relation with anyone, him included.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday he told me he wanted to be with me all the time, that he is jealous of many of my friends (because I was hanging out with some these days) and I said to him that the relation was toxic and that I can't handle the fact that he \"loves\" me too much. After that, we had a long conversation that some of my friend thinks toxic. He told that he doesn't have any friends if I'm gone (That's false since he had many online friends and I know he went to some high school parties) and that if I'm gone he is nothing, that kind of stuff. He also said that he can't change if I'm not here, but also that He doesn't want to change, and it'll be my fault if he doesn't change. I decided to stop talking to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, he left the group with his online friends and me. I'm afraid for him, but I know that it could just be blackmail. I know he is mentally bad, but he doesn't want to be helped, since he always makes excuses to do not go to a therapist.\n\n  \nMe, I worry about him, but I think he was maybe more obsessed with me than I thought. Like :\n\n\\- He wanted to be in the same town as me for Uni (before that he wanted to be in a closer town)  \n\\- He wanted to be in the same uni as S, who is a really close friend  \n\\- When I made a break with him, he talked with S, I don't have the screen so S could tell me something false, but he just always said to S that he loves me, that I had to stop the break, that kind of stuff. (He told me that he was talking with S about how was I)  \n\\- I know he was like this with one of his ex.  \nI keep persuading myself that that is just me, and I extrapolate all these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid to talk again to him, or that he blackmails me IRL if we go in the same town next year (He knows what uni I wanted to be on and that's the only uni in my country that provide that study).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR : My ex is obsessed by me, our relation lasted less than one month, I stopped to talk to him yesterday, so now I'm afraid about what will go on in the future for him and for me.",

        "text": "Around the end of highschool (17 years old) I started to go out with a girl for about a year, but after that, her family decided to go to the US because she needed a special operation for a problem that didn't let her walk for too long.\n\nWell, they travelled to the US and after a few months we decided to end the relationship because it was too hard to handle that long distance relationship.\n\n3 years later we started talking again, we stated at the beginning that we would remain only as friends, but in the end we couldn't avoid flirting, talking about love fantasies in calls and else.\n\nThat continued for about a year, but before continue let me clarify her family situation so that the following makes more sense. Once they decided to live in the US they knew it was almost imposible for them to get the residence (green card) so they went as illegal immigrants and they've been like that since forever, so when I started talking again to her their parents idea was that they would marry her to someone there to get the visa.\n\nSo one day after all the flirting she told me that her mother suggested her to start looking for friends in a... Christian dating app (their family is very religious), and after a while she met someone, but still we continued flirting like nothing for about 6 months.\n\nSuddenly, she stopped talking to me... Avoiding me until there were no replies, and after 3 months she told me she was getting married, to that guy. That was her last message...\n\nSo yeah... She married to him one year after meeting him while flirting with me... My doubt was... Is it really love? Were 3 months enough? Or it was too obvious it was for the visa?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; exgirlfriend married new guy in less than a year in strange circumstances",

What can I do to avoid being hurt?\n\nI (f23) met this really great guy (m25)! He’s very sweet, hardworking, gentlemen like and overall 10/10. He will be my 3rd serious relationship. \n\nWe’ve been talking almost a month now, though we haven’t labeled it. We talk everyday, ALL day and see each other 1-2 times a week. We’ve entered in that phase of pet names (babe, sweetie, etc), and we’ve talked about our families and our childhood. I’ve very VAGUELY mentioned him to my parents and they’re pretty happy for me. I don’t know if he’s mentioned me to family (as he’s from another country where his family lives.) all in all, i feel that we’re going at a really good pace.\n\nOne of my close friends invited us on a double date with her and her husband this weekend, and he said “of course”. Im excited, but also got a knot in my stomach. Im not nervous or scared about anything whatsoever. Its moreso the realization that “wow… we’re starting to feel like a real couple”! I had a bad ending to my first relationship (I’m a DV survivor) and a very emotional ending to my second relationship (we outgrew each other). \n\nI really like him so far and I’m scarred because its going too well. I know every relationship has its own ups and downs and right now we haven’t been together long enough to really experience those down moments. I want to say im ready for whatever and will keep my guard up, but im scared that the first “down moment” to happen will truly impact me, you know? For example, I’m not the skinniest girl in the world, what if he eventually didn’t like it? He’s definitely not ugly, in fact he’s a gym rat and is very attractive (almost out of my league)… what if another girl tries to catch his attention, or vice versa? What if I laugh too loud? What if the spark dies…\n\nHe’s told me a few times this week that he hasn’t been this happy or had this much fun in a long time and he enjoys being around me. LOL true story- I cooked dinner for him one time and brought it to him. His face LIT up like a kid in a candy store. He hugged me so tight and thanked me saying he hasn’t had a real meal since he left home a year ago (he lives with all male roommates). That made me feel SO good.\n\nI guess, I am falling a little quickly and i don’t want that because i don’t want to experience another heart break. Am i wrong for feeling this way this early? What should i do moving forward to avoid heartbreak?",

The roommate doesn’t seem very proactive to try and start something which she very much wants to do. Am I over reacting or is this normal ? Side note I believe trust is built not given and hope it’s not broken.\n\nTl;Dr: is this normal to have co Ed roommates and prefer it that way ? And how do you build trust under the circumstances?",

        "text": "I always hate making posts like this on reddit but I am completely desperate for reasons I will get to. The title sums it up mostly. She wanted a 3 month long break (which seems very long to me)  completely out of nowhere and of course I didn't really have a choice. She has NO end goal for the break. Absolutely no motive or direction. I get that there doesn't always need to be one, but for 3 months? I am very confused. I am scared because immediately after this she is moving away for a few months to live with her grandma, then coming back and going to college. I already felt like these were the last 3 months we might truly have together for a long time and now it feels like that time is being wasted. \n\nOutside of this, I am pretty scared at how I have been handling this. I truly don't know how to feel okay anymore and that scares me. I don't REALLY have any friends. What I mean by this is I feel alone with anyone but her. I always have, even before I met her. I don't even have anyone to talk to about how I feel anymore. I don't have anything to do anymore other than work. The unfortunate part about this is that I work for her father for his small business, working in her house. I am crucial to the business and if I leave it will likely fail at its current point.\n\nI feel useless in a way. When we got together she was at such a horrible point and I helped her build her confidence and learn to love life. It feels like she has /I have found every way to make me need her, and now she's left and I can't even tell why. All I know is that the last few weeks have been some of the best of her life according to her. \n\nThis break hasn't been all unproductive for me, as a matter of fact I feel like if it ended now it would be just what I needed. I have realized I haven't been good for her because I lost sight of a lot of things. I expressed this to her and she said that she's been hoping to hear that for a long time. That's all, no sign that that's what she hoped for out of the break or anything. \n\n\n\n\nI think I'm losing direction with this post. This is mostly a rant so forgive me. Forgive me if I sound stupid, I know I'm young. I don't understand any of this and that's why I'm making this post.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is what do I do? How should I feel? Why do I feel this way? Is something wrong? Why am I so dependent on her? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It feels like I'm meant to \"work on myself\" but I don't even know what that means. On top of that, I was at my healthiest I've ever been right before this break. I picked up kickboxing, had a promising future in my dream career, was regularly exercising. Now I can't sleep, I've lost so much weight but gained fat, and I feel terrible most of the time. It is so hard not to resort to bad habits. Half of the \"friends\" I have get drunk every weekend, but I know if I did that too I would be unlovable by the end of the break. I have to choose being sad and alone in the name of protecting myself from that. \n\nI lost direction again. I don't know. Thank you for reading, please give me advice\n\nTL;DR:\nMy girlfriend initiated a really long break with me and think I'm completely dependent and don't know what to do about it",

Did my laundry, cooked for me, I cooked for her, talked about life, our families, and had loads of sex, most of it unprotected, for 72 hours straight. \n\nShe told me we should “get a black rose tattoo” because that’s what I got her for her birthday. We were talking about what we would name our kids etc etc. We even said the L word which sounds insane but this shit was definitely love at first site. Her mom was looking into my parents, calling and asking to talk to me, and shit just felt scary natural, it was like I knew her my whole life, and she kept making comments on how she’s confused as to why she’s so comfortable around me, we were basically a married couple during that time, at least that’s what it felt like, we both agreed.\n\nI walked her to her car after work on Monday night, she said she loved me then went to bed. Fast forward to Tuesday afternoon I get a text that we moved rly fast and she’s overwhelmed and doesn’t wanna talk anymore. I get being overwhelmed cause that’s a lot to take in, but I’m confused because this was all mutual, I didn’t force anything onto her and if she was uncomfortable I don’t think she would’ve stayed with me for three days and said the L at first sight word. I asked if we were rly done and she said “for now”. I proceeded to tell her we can slow shit down etc etc but now she just won’t answer me.\n\nThis shit came outta left field and I’m honestly confused and can’t pin point a time where I felt an energy shift because everything was literally fine, she constantly brought up how I’m so different and how the situation was so new to her because she’s never had someone take her so serious.\n\nMy friend whose a girl says she’s gonna come back she’s just scared, rly scared, because she’s not the type to do all that just to get som weekends dick, I can tell. But what makes me nervous is I see her for the first time at work tmro, only for an hour, but idk if she’s coming back….\n\nTL;DR - I just wanna know if I need to mentally prepare to never have any intimate connection with this woman again, or if this is an opportunity to show I rly do care about her.",

They said they felt pressured but glad its not the case. I then sent a message to clear things up how I'm not mad they have other friend and don't expect to be their focus and we'll be able to meet soon. They said they enjoy catching up but we should only expect that from each other. I then asked the nature of our friendship and they told me they were done with the convo and when I asked for a mini call, they said they didn't want to talk and its better to drop it. They said we are cool but not to say stuff such as that to them again. I apologized then.\n\nWell we haven't spoken at all in 8 months. I wished them a happy b-day and they replied but that's it and I'm sure we are not friends and all they do is read my insta stories and vice versa.\n\nI realized now I pushed their boundaries due to my anxiety and I took it too personally and they were upfront about and that shows respect and all and I was wrong.

She said that if I really liked someone I would want to see them go home safely and that it had nothing to do with the argument.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I felt disrespected by her leaving so abruptly, and that my natural reaction was to just let her be as she stormed out. I even mentioned that I felt her actions were childish which I kind of regret because it definitely came off mean. She did not like my response and the whole situation got much worse than it had before we had this discussion.\n\nI'm having trouble putting into words why it did not feel right to walk her home after her storming out response to being upset.

She is a little orthodox in her thinking, whereas I have a more liberal approach. She used to tell me about their personal life, and even though I didn't find anything wrong with that, I didn't say anything.\nI am serious in my studies and generally, more on the shier side, when I was in my friend group she would stop me from going anywhere with them and tell me to hang out with her and said how we can't keep everyone happy, I also didn't go as my friend group was very non-serious in studies, always bunking and she was atleast more serious than them and didn't bunk but I started feeling as if she kinda started controlling me of everything -where should I go, who to meet , even what to eat etc.I remember there was a DJ night once and we had to get ready in our collage, I had to do makeup, I really like doing it and she didn't have to, she wasn't even letting me get to the washroom to do it , and even when I was doing it she was hurrying and preaching about natural beauty all the time, when I met my other friends they said I looked very pretty and how my makeup looked on point and offering me to click photos but she was asking me not to go, and to go with her somewhere else instead.They lit clicked the best photos i ever had.Also, from the incident that night, our university provided us with university buses as it was too late, even for those who didn't use it, I go home on my own in normal days and she goes in with us, I couldn't find my bus which was going at my route because I had no idea how to she knew which bus goes there  she lit went into her bus and didn't come and left me on my own, it was lit so dark, buses were departing in like 5 mins.I  eventually found it, and she later told me she didn't come because she would have lost her seat on her bus. After that day, I started keeping a little distance from her and she could feel it, I m the worst at hiding, I stopped sharing my assignment and she used to copy a lot or other such things and she pointed out, I said I have no duty to help her and it was an invalid reason to be angry about slowly even tho I sat with her, she started leaning towards two of my previous group friends whom she used to b****h a lot about. While maintaining that I am only talking to them for work and that in a social setting, we have to, but you are my best friend's demeanour, I was like, wasn't it you who said \"we don't have to keep everyone happy \", but anyways, those two were my good friends too, so I didn't pay much attention, see there is one more thing. I'm in roll number one, and those three are in roll number 40s, so during exams,we sit in completely different rooms, and I think those three started getting closer during that time. I  thought it was only natural and didn't pay much attention, I was absent after exam for 4 days and I felt like I could feel them all against me when I returned, even tho I didn't, even did anything, I started feeling like a stranger, they would also kind of s**t-shame me, they all are much more conservative than me, I feel like being used so I would hang out but not interact, now they call me out for that, I don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR! - i feel like my friend is manipulative , and used me  for her personal gain and an overall a jealous and stategic person who likes to b***h alot about others",

        "text": "My (33M) girlfriend (31F) works for her parents, who barely gives her any time off work. Is this worth breaking up over?\n\nMy gf and I have been together for almost 6 years. Throughout her college years she's never found a job that she loved. Two years ago, her parents convinced her to join their family business (after spending all of her 20s convincing her) and she finally agreed. Her family owns a dental office - both her dad and brother are dentists, the mom is an office manager, and now she is the co-office manager. This arrangement works out perfectly for their parents as they envisioned their kids to take over their business once they retire (parents are in their early 60s). \n\nThis office is without a doubt very successful and it's been around for 20+ years. Their family and the business is quite well-known in our small town. My gf has been enjoying the job the past couple years and she's pretty set on essentially taking over the business with her brother after their parents retire. However, aside from the actual work, she frequently clashes with her parents as they are VERY traditional, closed-minded, and have an extremely authoritative management style. Surely, her dad has a strong work ethic that's led him to where he is today, but he is not a team player (something he's self-admitted, it's his way or the high way). \n\nNow where this affects our relationship is how she only gets 5 days of vacation per year. Their family takes MANDATORY trips together on some major holidays, so that already knocks off a couple days of the 5. Because of this, she's already skipped out on many trips that are important to me - such as weddings, trips to visit MY family, birthdays, etc. We have an upcoming destination wedding later this year for one of my best friends (I'm the best man!). She currently has 3 days left to use but she'd need to take off 5 days. She asked her parents to make an exception and got denied. I'm getting tired of attending these events solo and having my SO miss out on all these milestones. She's upset about it too, and already can't stand dealing with her dad, but she feels like her hands are tied bc she doesn't want to quit on the family business, nor am I pressuring her to do so. But I don't even know what to do at this point. I still want to travel to so many places but I know I won't be able to with her. We are limited to traveling on the weekends only. Sometimes I laugh when I realize she is a grown woman and still has to ask her parents for permission to do these things. Is this a dealbreaker? What would you do?\n\nTLDR - GF works for parents who restrict her to 5 vacation days a year. She's been missing out on many important trips and events because she basically can never travel. I'm getting tired of showing up solo. Is this worth ending the relationship over?",

        "text": " I've written this out many times, each with to much detail for a post. So I've made it bottom line. My boyfriend keeps talking about his exes. If its from childhood relationships at age 5 to his last one from him being 26. (Besides flings, and sex) \n\n  I've told him multiple times to not do this, and the reasons why. Yet he says he's just telling a story and they happen to be in it, or he's just trying to express the hurt he has felt in the past, or remember something sweet from his childhood. \n\n  I do not want to shut out his feelings and experiences over the past he has faced but to me it feels like he cant let go of them. Even the one night stands, two week flings, and more. And I feel like I'm being compared to his \"first love\", \"the Korean ex\" , \"the baby mama\", and \"the crazy ex\". \n\nAmongst the other who knows how many by now, I could count it since I know all their names and faces since he HAD to show me them. \n\n Does anyone have any rational advice for how I can view this, am I looking to into it as a red flag? \n\n Is their any way you have explained this to a partner and how it hurts, in a way that made them stop or helped you two talk?\n\n  And if you have done this, why? (not talking about singular talking more of a everyday, in person, text, and call) Was it just talking about your past, or is there another reason.\n\n  I really care and love him and I want it to last. So any advice or help will be great. Thank you.\n\nTL:DR : My boyfriend wont stop talking about his exes no matter how much i ask him not to. He always brings them up no matter how long ago, or how serious it was. (including childhood relationships, sex, or flings, to full relationships) Should I be worried at all?",

        "text": "tldr: my best friend and I used to be close, but I feel like we have grown apart and our personalities have divided. Am I being too dramatic or am I in the wrong about this?\n\nOn mobile sorry\n I (28f) have been best friends with B (28f) for like 12 years now. Of course we have a lot of history and good times. We partied in high-school together and that's really how we became so close. Now I am newly married, a fully functional adult and she is pretty much the exact opposite of that right now. Just to paint you a picture of how our lives have diverged. \nI recently eloped and asked her to be my witness.  I said I'd like you to come but if you have to work or something I totally understand since it's so last minute. She says she can. Day of the ceremony comes and she says she drank too much and feels too sick to come. I respond simply with 'k\" \nShe asked what was up with the passive aggressive k. I say yes I am a little annoyed that you are choosing not to be there because you're fucking hungover. Mind you, I also drank and celebrated last night but you chose not to join us and got drunk by yourself evidently. \nShe doesn't show up. She says i need to express what i want to her more clearly bc she didnt realize i would be upset since we are still planning on having a formal wedding in a year. Long story short. We talk it out. I forgive her.\nA month later my husband accepts a new job in our home state, also where B lives. I ask her if she would be willing to come help me drive out there,  since my husband will have to drive separately as we have 2 cars to get across the country. She says okay, I buy her a flight and she comes. Today was the second day of the drive. Of the 18h we've driven, she has driven 4 hours. \nI have a tesla which is a little different to drive but it's still a car. There's always a reason she didn't want to drive. She was scared of the tesla. Then she didn't want to drive at night. Etc\nI told her today as we are checking into a hotel that I need her to drive more because that is why she is here. She says I need to express what I want more, I didn't ask and that's why she didn't know I wanted her to drive more. I say well I asked you to come out and help me drive. She's like ok I already said I would drive more you need to say what you want cuz I don't know. I say okay, you also never take initiative. You have not once offered to drive. And when I asked you to drive you drove briefly but then said to switch back as it had gotten dark and you don't want to drive in the dark. She says something like \"I thought you just wanted a buddy idk I was waiting for you to ask me to drive.\" Then follows up with \" we don't need to do all this, I already said I would drive.\" That really pissed me off. I pause, take a couple minutes and say I don't know what you mean when you say we don't have to do all this. I am expressing my feelings to you what do you mean we don't have to do this?\nI explain it's annoying when she takes no responsibility whatsoever whenever something happens and our relationship is in turmoil. That's why I included the eloping story, to show the patterns of her saying it's ultimately my fault, as I didn't tell her what I expected or wanted from her. \n\nI just feel like this is the nail in the coffin that will make me pull away from our friendship. I'll still be her friend but not nearly as close as we once were. She is not the person I need her to be, and I won't ask her to do things for me like this. I don't know if I'm being dramatic and I know this story is from my point of view but I'd like some outside perspective.",

We have been dating for the past 1 year and 1 month and have known each other for 2 years. All has been good we have had some really great times. But since this month she wanted to take a break (not break up just a break) from this rs and wanted to stay in the talking stage cause she feels guilty going out anywhere without me. Also we are long distance couple. She is in college right now and I am doing a job in my own city we have met 9 times for 1 week to 10 days each. We did everything couples can alone.... So in different cities we both have different lives she wanted to live her collage life to to fullest like attending festa going out... I never had a problem with any of that she just felt guilty doing so without me...she thought break would give her the freedom to do so... I loved her so i agreed... Just yesterday she tells me that she doesn't want this rs anymore cause she thinks there is no Gurentee for long distance to work.... She has never said this before I asked every thing in the end she tells me she doesn't feel anything for me any more but also goes to that I am not at fault here . I love her and want her to stay not against her will Ofcause also she believes the intimacy part of the relationship is missing cause we have always stayed like frinds we talk we make fun of each other we joke 90% of times but we also have deep conversations.... But mostly friends.... She is the best friend I ever had and I have always given her an open space to be herself everywhere even when we are doing the deed we don't feel shy anymore cause of the confert level that we have reached maybe that's why intimacy has left the question I rly don't know. mostly she is breaking up cause she thinks we will be great as friends but I want to be more then that I have imagined the future with her \n\nPlease help me guys I really need help here you can even text me Or reply here.",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nFor a few months now my girlfriend and I have been going out with a new group of people she met at work. All was fine at first until I began feeling like I had to fight this guy for my girlfriends attention. We would be sitting on a bench together and she’d have her back turned to me talking to him while twirling her hair. \n\nWe went ice skating and I was horribly uncoordinated and slow, so she went off and skated with him instead. That image is burned in my brain.\n\nI guess I’m just wondering how to address this without coming off as insecure, jealous, and untrusting.. thank you\n\nTl;dr - girlfriend acting flirty around coworker while we’re out. Wondering how to bring it up.",

        "text": "So let me start from the beginning;\n\nThis all starts with me posting on one of those \"find internet friends\" things. Been doing this occasionally for the past 2 years, as the past 4 years haven't been good to me, and has made me distant from many of the people who were in my life, and meeting some new people who share similar interests from the safety of the internet has been a good confidence booster, as well as a nice time for an introvert like myself. I always say in these posts that stuff like gender and sex won't cause them to be treated differently, and in all the men, women and otherwise I've met I've never treated them any different.\n\nNow around a month ago, I tried doing one of these posts again, and met a woman, and we really hit it off. She is about a year younger than me, and we share so many interests it's almost unbelievable. She laughs at my stupid jokes, and shares my sense of humour. Share a really similar taste in music. We love the same videogames, and enjoy playing together. We wish each other a good day and say good night every day. We also share similar mental health issues, and have openly talked to each other about our individual issues, and have been trying to support each other. After a day I was really down, she woke me up with a text about how much she appreciates her time with me. Had me in tears at 7am. No one has ever been that kind to me.\n\nI'd really like to make us a thing, but there are some issues;\n1. My own self confidence in this department is... in tatters at best. I'm not the best looking guy. Only had 2 other girlfriends in my life, so I am inexperienced as hell. She could definitely do better.\n2. She has grown to be a really close friend, and I don't want to ruin that. Not just for my sake, but I really really don't want to hurt her.\n3.On top of that, we met under the idea of \"all genders will be treated the same\". Part of me thinks it might just be immoral of me to try and escalate this relationship, when I basically said I wouldn't.\n4. And probably the biggest one; This would be a long distance relationship, as I live in the UK and she lives in eastern Europe. I have noooo idea how to handle this.\n\nI really don't know what to do. I'm up at 5am on a Thursday writing this because I can't get the thought out of my head. I really like her, and like what we have, but I don't know if I'm just being greedy or stupid to think that I want to be closer to her. I've only even known her a month! Am I just going too fast? Should I let time decide?\n\nI was going to wait and hope if she felt something between us, she might start that hard conversation and get this weight off my chest, but then I realized she is so like me in that regard maybe she is doing the same...\n\nI know I should just talk to her about it, but I just don't want to ruin what we have already, let alone stand a chance at hurting her.\n\nSorry this turned a little \"ranty\", it's just weird typing out something that's been stuck in my mind these past few days.\n\nTLDR: Talking with this woman online for just over a month, but have kinda fell for her, and have no idea where to go from here.\n\nSo, Reddit strangers, please lend me your advice, and let me steal a little of your courage.",

        "text": "Hi all! My girlfriend, let’s call her Suzy, and I are moving in with one another. We are in love and hope to be married some time in the next couple years. We’ve been in a relationship for almost half a year now and when we initially started dating, we’d really see each other only about once a week. Suzy’s mom was visiting from another country and would watch Suzy’s daughter (let’s call her Stephanie) for most of our initial dates for maybe the first 2 months or so. \n\nWhen I first met Stephanie at a dinner at Suzy’s apartment, I found her to be a very sweet, yet somewhat socially awkward child. But I thought, “who isn’t at around 10?” At first, we started to bond with board games, but eventually Stephanie tired of them. When Suzy and I made the decision to rent an apartment together, Suzy let me know she talked to Stephanie about it and Stephanie just wanted her mom to be happy and was okay with it. Since then, she has been very distant. It’s hard for her seemingly at times for her to be in the same room with me. When she isn’t going off to her room, she is paying attention solely to her phone. \n\nFor context, I don’t have a lot of experience with kids. Half my family is in another state and I’m essentially estranged from the family on my late father’s side. His father’s family was very old. My grandfather had been born in the 1800s and my father’s half brothers were all in their 70s and 80s when I was a kid in the 90s. I just have zero experience with children as an adult. I’ve never held a baby or really thought of myself as someone who would be a good father. I have anxiety issues I never wanted to pass on to my kids.\n\nI really want to be able to eventually support my girlfriend and her daughter financially and be a good role model as a man in Steph’s life. That said, I’m not delusional. I’m not Steph’s dad or even stepdad. I’m essentially a stranger who will be living with her in a few weeks. I’m not sure what to do. \n\nAre there any books on this? I’m not even sure what to search because I am not even a stepdad at this point. I want to have as good of a family life I can with them. I realize I may have already made mistakes by not incorporating Steph into more of our early activities or decisions. I’m not sure. \n\nCan anyone lend some advice?\n\nTLDR: Moving in with my girlfriend and her daughter and want a better relationship with my girlfriend’s daughter. Things are distant at this point. Need advice.",
