Thinking it's just a bug or something I hit the wiper button or toggle whatever to get it off. I was absolutely horrified to see a tiny bird stuck in my windshield wiper going across my windshield. Tears came down my face right then. It was still moving helplessly. I'd have pulled over right then but the boss kept a close eye on run times and he'd have been pissed if I told him I was trying to save a bird obviously. Right when I pulled in behind the store I jumped and tried to help it. It was stuck pretty bad I'm sure I must have broke it's wing getting it free. I put on the ground and it hoped away. One of the saddest moments of my life, but it helps to get it out of my head.",

        "text": "I delivered for two separate businesses in two separate towns nearly a decade ago. Nothing mind blowingly interesting to report, but I do have a few decent stories.\n\nTL;DR: Smoked some weed, almost died, wrecked and abandoned a shitty car, pissed off a skateboarder, touched a butt, killed a deer.\n\n**Story one:** Took an order to a house on the outskirts of town. Delivery instructions were to go to the garage. Get to the garage, it's a man-cave of sorts. Customer is a 30-something dude, clearly stoned. Immediately notice a joint sitting on the table. As he hands me the money he says \"Money's a little tight right now, wish I could tip you more, man.\" I point to the joint and reply, \"No worries. You could burn that with me.\" He goes \"Oh shit! I thought I put everything away!\" We have a good laugh, we smoke the doob, he ends up pulling a huge bag of pot out of the fridge and sells me an 8th. Good times!\n\n**Story Two:** Had a driver in the oncoming lane fail to yield and turned left right in front of me. Wish I had a dashcam because I pulled the most epic evasive maneuver of all time, avoiding a serious collision by a matter of inches.  Words cannot do this moment justice.  It's one of the proudest moments of my life.\n\n**Story Three:** Same town, a few weeks later. Wasn't super familiar with this town, hadn't lived there long, had been GPSing every address. This particular order was to an apartment complex I had been to a few times, and I knew there was a shortcut through the mall parking lot. It was dark and raining that night. I attempted to take the shortcut. Noticed a few seconds too late that I was barreling into the dead end of a 3 way intersection. Tried to brake and steer out of the way, but hit a curb at a roughly 45 degree angle going around 30mph. Completely obliterated my front passenger side tire and wheel. Had the car towed to a shop. Spent two hours the next day at a pull-and-pay junkyard trying to find a replacement wheel. Took it to the shop. Wrong size. Two more hours at the junkyard. Back to the shop. Wheel fits but the collision bent my control arm. Tire would rub against the inside of the wheel well whenever I turned left. Horrible screeching noise at all times. The wheel literally fell off while I was driving it a few weeks later. Grabbed all my valuable belongings (which included a guitar + small amplifier), called my friends to come get me and started walking. Left the car there, never saw it again.\n\n**Story Four:** New town, new business. Some teenager seemingly on purpose flung his skateboard into the road as I was driving by. Ran it over, broke the deck in half. Yelled \"dumbass!\" out the window and kept driving. I get back from my next delivery and the kid and his mom are standing in the lobby yelling at the manager. They're accusing me of running it over on purpose. Demanding a new skateboard. I was agitated by the lack of honesty and sense of entitlement so I reply, \"what if I need new tires? You gonna pay for those?\" She didn't like that very much. Rest of the details are hazy, but the owner ended up buying the kid a new skateboard. The kid came out ahead on that because he only needed a deck but got a whole setup.\n\n**Story Five:** One of the servers lived in a neighborhood about half a mile away from the store. We had a little fling. If she wasn't working, I'd routinely stop by her house on my way back from a delivery and fool around for a bit. Good times!\n\n**Story Six:** Hit a deer on the way to some apartment complex. Two lane highway, busy traffic in both directions. Had somebody tailgating me pretty hard. No idea how the deer even got half way across the road, but he came from the left. Clipped his back legs pretty square as he was jumping across the road, he spun at least 720 degrees through the air and landed on the shoulder. Just kept driving, didn't even touch my brakes. Had to look hilarious from the guy behind me's perspective. Pizza guy is on a mission! Get to the delivery, my grill is destroyed. Deer fur stuck in my hood. Pieces of my bumper hanging on by a thread. Got a decent tip. Filed a police report. Insurance ended up doing roughly $3000 worth of body work, I didn't have to pay a dime.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "Hello fellow subredditors,\n\nI am about to start this delivery driving job for dominos next week and i have a couple of questions. Some of them may be obvious or different for each store, but this is my first job here in the US and as a student i don't have much experience, so any advice will be helpful. Now i know most of them might be answered in my training, but i just want to know them beforehand just in case. First question is about the change cash. I know the store gives you some money for change, but what about your own personal cash. If, for example, you don't have enough to return do you use your own cash and tell the manager after that or??? Another question is for the tips. Lets say the customer has to pay $21.50 and gives you $25 for the total + tip. Do you hand over that $3.50 to your manager or you just put it in your wallet, return the $21.50 and the tip never happened? Last question, as a foreign student who just came to the states a few months ago, i have absolutely zero knowledge of the area around the dominos im going to work for. I've used google maps to get around and it has always worked. Will google maps help me find my destination?\nThose are the 3 main questions i had. I know they may seem obvious and stupid for you, but for me finding an answer will really help me out and boost my confidence. Thank you and have a great day.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention that the pay is $8.25 while in store and $4 when out, every delivery is $1.50. ",

        "text": "Taking into account Rules 1&amp;5, I've been wanting to ask this here for a while. Place I work at (rhymes with Smominoes) has a lot of carryout business. There is only one insider who is not management. Drivers are expected to cut pizza, fold boxes, take orders, tag boxes, grab supplies and help customers at the counter and window. Sometimes we get tips from those customers. One manager decided that only insiders should get inside tips and started demanding drivers turn over any inside tips for the inside tip pool (mostly or all managers, as I said.) Store manager has decided not to get involved (though he doesn't take them himself) and apparently the corporation has no policy about it.  \n\nSo how does the sub feel about this? I think a tipped employee (shorted to $4 while on the road) should keep all tips given to them. This is a good area so it might be $5-10 on a weekend night per driver. This means the manager has given herself a couple of dollars raise by stealing from the drivers. Her argument consists of how hard she works making pizza, an argument I find flimsy bc back of house employees never get tips in any restaurant and managers usually don't take part in tip pools. Opinions? Policies at your store?  ",

        "text": "My first job was in pizza, as the title says, ten years ago. Stuck with it through time, worked at all of the big three, and a couple others (some non pizza but still delivery) here and there, and then cycled back to the pizza company I got my start at. I've been a CSR, an Assistant Manager, a GM in training, make line, cut guy, dough guy, you name it, I've done it. Delivering, however, is what I've done the longest. I'm on a different path in life now, career outside of food service and whatnot, but I still deliver once every week or two to make some spare cash. From stab wounds to counterfeit printers, stolen vehicle(twice) to death threats, borderline fist fights, to 70 hour on the clock weeks of solid ice roads, just barely not getting fired more times than I'd like to admit, the weirdest shit you'd ever think customers could do, and everything in between, I've got some stories, man. \n\nLet's start with a shorter one, but one of the worst customer experiences that I'll never forget. This one time I delivered to a group of 13-14y/o kids who were already obvious shit heads from the beginning of the interaction, asking all the awesome questions like \"you feel proud of your job pizza boy?\" and shit. Keep the straight face, tell them the total, and they run inside to grab the money.  You guessed it, big ass ziploc bag of coins, no quarters. I count it all out in front of them, cause fuck getting shorted, and it's to the exact penny. Figures, but hey that's part of my job. Give em the ol' \"Thanks guys, have a great night!\" And they say oh dude, sorry, we forgot your tip! I'm thinking Oh, cool, maybe they aren't so bad. Guess what, another fucking bag of coins, but this time in a paper bag, all wrapped and taped due to the weight. Still straight faced and generic customer service voiced, but now pissed off internally, I get back to my car. I don't even open the bag of tip coins to count it til I get back to the store. When I finally get there, I cut it the bag open to count it, and it's 70 cents in pennies, a ton of small rocks(to add weight to make me assume there was more I'd imagine) and a bunch of strips of paper that said \"you thought we tipped you lol\" or just a bunch of negative shit like \"meaningless\" and \"no future\". Still to the day amazed how much thought they put into shitting all over whoever happened to show up at their door. \n\nI have never been so tempted to go back to a customers house off the clock and fuck their shit up, but it was just a bunch of awful kids, not worth my job/jail, and looking back after the fact kinda impressive on their end. This was almost three years ago, and I can still remember those fucking kids. Kept some of those scraps of paper in my lockbox til the day I quit. \n\nAnyhow, I have stories for days about stuff I've seen, and have so many words of advice/pointers to give to the  younger, or newer to the job crowd, I'll probably be around this sub a lot in the future.  Remember: lock your car, don't write in tips, don't beg for tips, and never under any circumstances fuck with someone's food.\n \nDrive safe dudes! \n\nEDIT: Their address was blacklisted. I forgot to mention that part. Sucks for their parents if they ever wanted delivery, but sometimes you have consequences for raising shit heads. Or maybe they're awful too. Who knows, screw em.

        "text": "I'd like to share my story. This happened about 6 months ago. I had just gotten to work. It was still light outside and we were pretty busy. I snagged the first two runs up and took off on my double. They were both going to the \"hood\".  Made my first delivery no problem and headed to my next. \n\nAs I pulled around the corner arriving to my second delivery I see a black dude standing outside of the address and another riding a bike in the street slowly in circles like they were talking. Definitely a red flag but like I said, it was early evening and still light outside so I didn't think anything more of it. I pull up on the wrong side of the street in between the two with my driver side door facing my delivery address. I roll down the window and asked the guy standing there if he ordered. He said yes. I hop out and go to open my back door where I keep the food. When I turn around he goes and reaches behind his waistband and pulls out what looks like a .45 or a glock and said \"give it up, nigga\" (I'm white) as he points the gun in my face. \n\nI didn't freak out or anything. I was surprisingly calm especially since I had like $300 in my wallet.  I shoved the food bag at him and gave it to him.  I reach in my back pocket and retrieve my $20 change bank the store gives you to get your night going and handed him that as well. I wanted to tackle him so bad but I felt like this cat has never held a gun before. Im 6'2 200 lbs and he was prolly a few inches shorter and over 50 lbs lighter. It was wobbling in hands making me uneasy like he was gonna accidentally shoot me. At this point I opened my hands and threw my arms out signifying you got it all. He said get in your car and go while still pointing gun at me. In one fluid motion I dive in the car, throw it in gear, and floor it. I look over my shoulder when I get halfway down the block and he's running behind the building. I loop around the block as I'm calling 911 to see if I can get a visual. As I'm doing so I notice the other black dude on the bike so I pull up next to him. I yell out the window as dispatch is picking up \"Where's your homeboy!?\"  He shrugs and continues to ride his bike down the street. I decide to stay with this guy. I explain to dispatch what has happened as I'm tailing this guy on a bicycle. He notices I'm not leaving him so he stands up on his pedals and starts to go. Pulling down alleys and side streets, I stick with this guy on the bike relaying my position the whole time. Finally, after a slow 5 minute pursuit, an unmarked police cruiser tries to pull me over. I stop and motion him on and point the perp out to him. \n\nI was extremely lucky. Out of all the outcomes to happen from this situation this would have been one of the best. The one they caught on the bike gave up the name of the one with the gun and they were able to capture him a couple days later. Both 15 year old kids smh. Be safe out there fellow drivers. Trust your gut. If something is sketchy, don't feel like you have to make the delivery. Phone your manager and say this delivery does not feel safe and I guarantee you they will be on your side. ",

One driver opens and one closes with that little over lap period. Sometimes there isn't even an over lap period , usually on weekdays. Morning driver will take about 14-20 deliveries and the closing driver will take about 18-24 deliveries depending on the day. More on weekend potentially. We have to personally manipulate the promise time constantly to keep it at 30 minutes so people actually place orders. I feel like we would have more business if we had more drivers on during peak hours but the upper management is always complaining about cost of labor. Are they screwing themselves out of more sales or are they right to think by always having a skeleton crew they'll save more money",

In 2013 we stopped taking personal checks for orders since too many bad checks were getting written. We apologized for the inconvenience, we warned people a month in advance that this change was taking place.\n\nThis one customer always paid with checks. At first we accepted them, but told him next time he'd need to pay cash or card if he ordered. He'd go months without ordering, and then out of the blue call up and ask to speak to the manager because he only pays in checks. I'd tell him we can't accept them. He'd get angry and hang up. Call back a few weeks later, ask to speak to the manager. Manager tells him, sorry, we don't accept checks. This goes on well into 2015. Some people just can't take a hint. ",

        "text": "With 19 years of full time delivery experience, I probably take my job a little too seriously? I try to be perfect. Never show agitation with even the worst of customers. Always arrive with a smile and friendly personality. Thank those of who stiff me just as gratefully as those who tip me $10. And I don't screw up. At least, very rarely. \n\nI had an incident tonight at dinner rush, though.  I should probably just let it go, but I'm  still livid five hours later. \n\nYou may have read my story a couple weeks ago about a problem delivery to customer at Home Depot, which led to a customer complaint. Well, tonight I got another!\n\nIt had been fifteen years  since my last complaint, and now I get two in two weeks!  I'm on a roll! \n\nTonight's issue was a delivery to one of my bi-weekly regulars who I've delivered to for six years. Middle aged, middle class family with three young kids. The mom comes off as kind of a bitch, but the husband, who I usually deal with, is generally cool. Never had a problem with him.  Well, except a little issue...\n\nOver over the past year and a half, I've busted my butt getting their food over as quick as I can, only to get there to find they're not home from work yet!  Three times! Food goes back to store, they call two hours later, and I get redispatched. The husband then tells me I was faster than they anticipated, acts embarrassed, and tells me they had called on the way home from work. \n\nUp until now, I've always assured him it was no big deal, no problem. Even though it has been dinner rush, and a return trip really throws wrench into things for me. It costs me tips on my other orders who are also waiting. \n\nWell tonight it happens again!  I'd been there for about five minutes. Knocking on all doors and going around to the back of the house while snow and a whipping wind were having at me.  I finally get back to the car, go to try calling the customer (no answer) and start backing out. Just then, the wife pulls in the driveway. \n\nI was a bit perturbed at this point.  I'm thinking, \"Lady, this is the third damn time! Common!\" I get out if the car, put on my happy face and make a joke about, \"I guess I was to quick for you?\"\n\nIt was then, during the transaction,  that I had to say something. So I did. While not  being condescending, I simply said, \"Ma'am, I just need to let you know that this has happened to me here a few times  We usually stop delivering after two times. Just so you know, they might cut you off if  this happens again.\"\n\nShe replies, \"Here? Two times, or a few times?!? How many? I don't think so!\"\n\nME: \"Actually,  this is the third time.  We keep track in your customer records.  It's been you're husband the last two times that this has happened. \n\nCustomer:  \"I'd like to see proof of that\" \n\nMe: \"I'm just letting you know. I've been the driver those three times\"\n\nWith the that, she tips me $7 and takes the food. I generously thank her, smile and tell her to have a great weekend.\n\n (I very rarely deal with this women, almost always her husband.  The only other time she's paid, her two small children peaked their head out the door and started babbling to me and saying hello. Trying to show me their toys. I was just being polite and saying hello back, trying to act interested when she storms out, gives me the evil eye, and asks her kids why theyre total king to strangers?  All while looking at me like I'm some random guy in the park that just wandered over and started chatting up her kids)\n\nNo sooner than I get back, the husband calls. ( He wasn't even there for the transaction. ) He immediately goes into how \"Your driver was very rude to my wife, and I don't appreciate that, bla bla bla. For five minutes!  My manager couldn't even get a word in. Told him she was sorry, and she'd investigate what happened. \n\nI'd alerted her minutes before that I thought this customer might be calling. Explained what the history was and thought they'd have my back. Instead, I'm told I can't \"argue\" with the customer. She believes me and is on my side, but won't explain to customer that this in an ongoing issue, and they need to be home when they order.\n\nI know i'm going to have to go back here soon. I dread it, especially after my management didn't take my back. I'm not even sure if I can act friendly next time?  I'm so angry.\n\nI always bump these customers order ahead in line when it's busy, because they are regulars with $50 orders and they tip. I bring plates and napkins. I try to get it there piping hot. When my coworkers fail to give them the weekend pizza special, I go into the computer and adjust the price so they save $14 dollars. I let them know I fixed it for them to save them some money. \n\nI go out of my way to offer them above and beyond service!  Yet, they keep pulling this ordering before they're home BS.  \n\nAt what point do you say something? Am I really just suppose to keep my mouth shut and keep pretending like its no big deal for me? Are you always rude in the customers mind if you dare say what they don't want to hear, or call them out on their error?  What the hell gives with people? \n\nSome people are clueless and order when they're not home. But who does it 3+ times and doesn't learn from their mistake? \n\nO.k. I get it. They don't want to wait. They're hungry and it's been a long day. Well, I have a long day delivering for ten hours. I don't want to wait for you to get home when I get there, only to find your ass ain't at home. Or, even make s return trip. It's costing me time and money.  Guess it's better mine than theirs?  How dare I say something!\n\n I guess I'm one rude SOB?\n",

Drivers fought over who had to take them, constantly.  \n\nAnyway, I said fuck it and took one; as it was a three-bagger and the other two were on the way, and even if I got stiffed on all three, the delivery charge alone would put $7.50 in my pocket.  \n\nAnyway; I take the first two that aren't the trailer park first, even though the trailer park ordered first.  Tippers get their food first, sorry!\n\nI eventually arrive at the trailer park, get their food from the car and turn around and go to take my first step into the road when suddenly a big F350 almost plows into me, turns right suddenly and smashes into the porch of the house I was about to deliver to.  The two male occupants jump out, grab bats from the bed of the truck, and run up to the door and begin attempting to force their way in.\n\nI stand there flabbergasted for a minute trying to process what I was watching, before moving back into my car and contemplate either grabbing my .45 and ending this myself; or calling the cops.  I call 911 because frankly .45 is expensive and this house is a known scammer, sort of place where they will hand you a big fistful of change, snatch the food and then slam the door; and the change is always short a dollar or two but management won't cut them off.  I also don't know if they're armed with more than the bats, and don't want to find out.\n\nOperator tells me to move away from the house and stay right there.  I mention that I am armed, so that the police are aware.  I pull a little bit further up the street and simply sit and watch.  At some point the two assailants have gotten into the house.\n\nI lean back in my seat, pull their pizza out of the bag and start munching on their pizza; it's clear they aren't getting it and at this point, I really don't care. \n\nA good 15 minutes later  An ambulance arrives first, pulls up next to me, I point out the house and they say \"Cops here yet?\"  \"Nope.\"  \"We can't go in until the cops are here.\"  \"The two dirtbags already left.  You probably saw them leave, just a few minutes ago.  Big red F350.\"  \"Ah... Yep, we saw them.  They nearly hit us.\"  \"Hey, want some pizza?  It was for them, but I don't think they'll be eating it.\"  \"Sure!\"  We all hop out and the 2 paramedics and I sit and chow down on their food.\n\n45 minutes later 3 sheriffs deputies arrive and enter the trailer.  I'm instructed to stay there to give a statement.  Three hours later I get to give my statement.\n\nApparently the dude inside was bangin' out one of the other two dude's wife, and owed drug money.  They beat him half to death with bats and left.\n\nGot fired for being out 4 hours on a run, even though I told them where I was and why; and had documentation showing that.\n\nI did sue for unlawful termination, if you're wondering.  They settled out of court and I got a little lump sum, which my bitch wife has now spent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: This is the authors wife and I just wanted to clear a few things up. First don't leave your reddit account logged in on the phone ESPECIALLY as it pops up with a notification every time someone comments on your post! Secondly, don't lie and slander your wife online, your manly parts will pay dearly for that. Just so everyone knows, I (the wife) was actually with him on this drive, most is true, some parts are not. No he didn't get any money from it, so no even if I had wanted to, I couldn't of spent it. I certainly DONT have a spending issue, any kind of hoarding or emotional stability issue. Infact I'm the one that opened a savings account in the relationship. So that's all a bunch of bull right there! He better rethink his \"settled for less\" comment.  Thanks all, Wife. ",

However she didn't order any ranch sauces, just noted there should be some. So the person who took the call added them to the total (I'm not sure if they told them or not but you will probably be able to guess soon) a total of $1 in sauces was added on to the ticket and it was sent off with me after I once'd over the little scrap o' paper.  \n\nWhen I got there she was confused as to why there was not **FIVE** sauces. I was confused and asked why she thought that, and she explained (not calmly) that she should have gotten four ranch sauces for, what amounted to, four single orders of wings and one more for the side that does indeed come with one. I had three sauces for her and explained we saw her note saying \"ranch for the wings\" and inferred that she meant one ranch for each order of wings as she ordered two double orders.\n\nShe continued that she worked at the same chain in a different state up until she moved to my area and they gave sauces for each order of ranch for free. In the four years I've worked there that was only true for the first.\n\nSo I ask you fellow drivers, does your store give sauces complementary with orders of sides?

Today was our soft opening, and because of that I only had 1 delivery. I got tipped five bucks and it was nice being out of the kitchen and on the road by myself. \n\nI've spent the majority of my time in the kitchen, on the make line, at the cutting table, making dough, and cleaning, a shit ton of cleaning. I'm a little concerned that my shifts are always going to be like this, only a couple deliveries and the majority spent in the kitchen, which I don't prefer. Does anyone think it'll get better or have a similar experience?\n\nAlso, I applied for part time, because college is a lot to deal with sometimes, and I mentioned that because of scheduling conflicts I had to quit my last job. However my manager still isn't understanding that and scheduling me for every single day other than Tues/Thurs (school days) for 6-7 hours each time. I have trouble confronting my manager about wanting to cut it to 20-24 hours but I'm afraid it'll cause a problem like my last job.\n\nAny advice?",

        "text": "Ok, so a few ago I had a pretty large order of around $200 placed by a customer that was outside our delivery zone. Well since it was such a large order, management decided to allow us to take the order. So I'm the one who is set to take it, and it turns out that they were putting in a $70 tip! Sounds good to me! Well my manager comes to me and tells me that while it is $70, only $20 is going to me, and the rest of it was being split amongst the in-store personnel. The order had tipped with their visa, so if they had given me $70 cash, I could've probably kept it for myself.\n\nWell this did leave me in a bit of confusion, because I didn't understand what my manager meant. When I asked about a split tip to the customer, they seemed confused and said that everything should be paid for.\n\nHere's where the real kicker comes in. We have to confirm online tips in our computer when we clock back in from a delivery, so I asked my manager \"well if I'm only getting $20 do I put in $20?\". To which she said that I put in the whole $70 and then I'll give them $50 extra at the end of the day to split for the rest of the staff. In cash. Which means that I'm reporting that I got a $70 tip when really I'm only getting $20. Won't I be taxed for that? If it truly is a company policy, why don't they have a system that doesn't feel so under-the-table? This whole thing feels pretty sketchy. Any thoughts?\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: So I talked to my GM during my shift today. She said that the place specifically requested the tip be split up that way, and that it was a very rare occasion. I still told her that I shouldn't be taxed for it, to which she stated she didn't even think about the fact that that would happen and apologized. She told me she would get it fixed, and I did ask for it in writing, so I guess we'll see what happens when I see her for my next shift on Wednesday.",

        "text": "As a delivery driver for a few years I have come to the opinion that sometimes tipping your driver purely based on percentage isn't appropriate  in some, if not most, situations. Delivery tips should be based off of the service required of your delivery rather than cost (after all at my store we use our own vehicles and pay for our own gas). I feel that tips should take into  consideration the distance to a given address and the amount  of time and effort that is required to bring a customer their food.\n   The way I look at it is if I have to do a delivery that takes 30 minutes  (yes our delivery area is too large but the owner refuses to stop delivery to the really really far areas which hurts overall delivery times and driver tips. For example I once had to take a delivery that was 25 minutes one way, to a town we have never delivered to, because one of our kitchen staff had no idea what was in or out of our delivery radius but since the order was made before anyone noticed the mistake) you should be giving your driver a good tip regardless of the price of your order. If I am delivering two subs or 4 large pizzas to you I am driving the same distance  and using the same amount of gas. For example if I am delivering two subs that cost a total of $17 a 20% tip would be $3.4 but two pizzas that cost $40 would have a 20% tip of $8. I don't see why it would be okay to give the first driver $3.4 but the second driver $8. Tipping a base percentage seems to hurt drivers who take smaller orders since they are driving the exact same distance and using the same amount of gas as drivers who take the larger ordrs.\n   The only exception I see to this is for very large orders. Anything over $100 I am totally OK with a 10% tip to the driver. However large orders should think of tipping more than just the driver since such orders tend to have a large impact on the store itself. People may not realise that large orders can have a direct impact on the kitchen and from the of house staff. In my store any order with eight or more pizzas will completely fill our ovens thus causing other orders to get backed up and take longer than normal. At my store orders that consist of numerous  salads and subs can cause dramatic backups since the store sees large orders as a priority.",

        "text": "I just moved here a month ago, and I originally ordered most of my food from Dominos, always got some deal that added up to $3.99~$9.99. Since I lived a block away, I would just carry it out straight from the store. Sometimes I would order delivery from other places like chinese food, but they always refused tip. If a place that delivered did accept tip, I tip $3~5.\n\nHopefully you can understand where I'm coming from when I say... I'm upset. The delivery places here are incredibly overpriced. I have to go through $15 minimum fee, taxes, delivery, NONE of which have gone to the delivery person, order comes out to A GIANT $16.68 + $5.00 for ONE large pizza... but I found out CHOWNOW doesn't tip the delivery person my $5, so that's $21.68 they give directly to the STORE, meaning the store can choose to NOT TIP AT ALL. And I thought I was making a good impression this entire time.\n\nI just caved in yesterday and bought a bunch of frozen pizza. Why does it taste so much better than any of the pizza I've made over the last 2 years? At one point I was making pizza every day and trying recipes from all different websites... I'm ashamed. Yes, I've bought and tried many things, pizza stone, cast iron pan, solid pans, perforated pans, small pans (12\"), big pans (18\"), always have the oven at 550 degrees, and have tried both electrical and gas oven in my life. And, of course, it always costs $1.80~$4.50 per frozen pizza at most. Yes, a decent sized (12\" or more) frozen pizza does go that low , especially on sale.\n\nWhich is much, much less money than I spend making it from scratch, sadly. Buying in bulk (you know, 32 oz of lowest priced mozzarella, 5lb flour... etc), it costs $2.25 for 8oz of mozzarella, $0.50 2 cups flour, $0.28 yeast in jar, $0.30 pizza sauce, $0.80 for vegetarian toppings, $0.12 1 bottle of water, $0.60 for 1 teaspoon of 4 different spices each, let's just say $1 for sugar/brown sugar/salt/oil/milk powder/wheat gluten/whatever... a total of $5.85. That's pretty fair all things considered, a perfectly tailored pizza (in theory) has a good price. It's actually probably more than stated since I'm doing the labor and I have to microwave/oven at high temps, but let's just leave it at that. And sometimes I'll do an 18 inch pizza, so it's a little bit more ingredients used, so maybe making my own pizza costs me around $6~8. Frozen pizza? Less or equal in price and tastes better for some reason, and can be put in the oven at much lower temps. If I choose to add toppings, add $0.80 cents and it's still only $2.60~$5.30. Mostly on the low side. I've started reading frozen pizza ingredients in hope that I can see what spices/cheeses they're using. I only recently learned about wheat gluten being incredibly important.\n\nAnd I want to say \"oh, but the frozen pizza wasn't as good as delivery\" but my delivered pizza comes luke-warm or cold every time. I finally was fed up and asked the delivery guy \"am I tipping you enough?\" and he admits that he waits to deliver my order because the delivery people claim they NEVER SEE A TIP FROM ME. Well yeah, I guess that's because THE TIP IS FROM MY CREDIT CARD ON CHOWNOW, I PUT IN \"$5.00\" AND APPARENTLY YOUR STORE IS SOMEHOW LEGALLY STEALING ALL OF IT FROM YOU.\n\nI'm not paying $21.68 anymore for a one-topping pizza that ends up cold because the delivery driver isn't getting my 30% tip. I realize I can order by phone and pay upfront, but I only carry emergency cash at home, and ordering online gets me coupons for discounts and one free item (2-liter soda or undercooked garlic bread). And none of that matters if my tip isn't getting me bare minimum service. \n\nSomething has to change. If pizza chains are moving to ChowNow and other garbage websites, they should give half of that cost to the delivery guy and change the minimum to $10. On top of that, how about we pay them minimum wage or better? I'm tired of paying a \"tip\" that is stolen by the stores that are operated online by companies like ChowNow, and I'm sure it costs these places like $2~3 to make a pizza at most. Ugh.\n\nStarting to hate pizza now... apologies if this was ranty, it's really not meant to be. \n\nCan someone who delivers tell me if you would ever INTENTIONALLY give poor service because you're not receiving tip? I want to cry knowing like 10 orders of increasingly bad service could probably have been prevented if I kept a stack of 5 dollar bills nearby and never paying the store more than what was asked. I mean, it's stupid in the first place that I'm paying anywhere near $15 plus tip for one pizza, but ugh...",

I can understand kids trying it, but an adult? Seriously? And then she says, \"I'm sure you would remember my order. It was *12 pizzas!*\" like 12 pies is some unheard of amount of pies to order. We get an order from a megachurch down the street from us every Saturday that is always between 20-60 pies. But no, I should remember Ms 12 pizzas over here. \"The customer is always retarded\" is my new saying.",

        "text": "So, this happened a few hours ago and I'm mostly over it, but I still can't help but have some lingering feelings. \n\nSo it's my first delivery of the night. The total is $64.75. Now at my PH they give is 15 dollars to make change and that's it. No change change or anything like that. Even in my car, I don't keep anything of the sort (I collect my change so I can turn it in when my jar is full). Anyway, let me go on because I'm hoping this will be catharsis. \n\nI deliver to a motel and I deliver to a motel, its a woman by herself and we exchange the usually greetings and the first thing she says to me is, \"Do you have a quarter?\"\n\n\"No I'm sorry I don't.\" I thought that would be in the end of it--usually it is.  And I give her pizza, explain to her that we put her sides in the big pizza box and everything. She gives me the money and I tell her, \"I hope you have a great day, let me get the door for you.\" \n\n\"EXCUSE ME. YOU OWE ME 25 CENTS.\" I stop and stare at her and repeat what I said. \n\n\"I'm sorry but I don't have any change to give you. They only give us fifteen dollars.' AT this time my mind is spinning I\"m thinking, I wonder if I call the store could I see if I could get her a discount or credit, maybe my manager could do something. Now if I give her a dollar my register would be short. I had those thoughts swirling at that time and she's ranting at me about stealing from her and how tomorrow is her wedding day and I am stealing 25 cents from her. \n\nThen she says, \"I can fucking take you. You'd be wrong if you think I can't.\" I stared at her for a moment and then she starts talking about how her father is a manager at Pizza Hut and I'd be fired if he was my manager for doing this, and again I try to explain--but in reality...my customer service part of my brain has been shut off. \n\nShe's talking about how \"hard it is to find jobs in CA\" as though to scare me, little does she know that this job is an enjoyment for me to make friends and a little extra money to take care of my kiddos and that I make a decent living with substitute teaching. Not to mention I also may have gotten a third job last Friday so that when I go back to school I won't have to worry about my income.  \n\nAnyway, I\"m listening to her rant and rave, accusing me of stealing and she's calling my manager, all while STILL threatening me. Kicking my ass, beating me down, etc. She tells that to my manager. And at that point, I'm done. I hear my manager on the phone and I'm like, '...Yeah I'm leaving.\" \n\nSo that's what I did.\n\nI started to drive back, while the customer comes running out screaming, \"WHERE'S MY CHANGE YOU BITCH?!\" I'm like, whatever. I drive. Manager calls and asks, \"what happened?\"\n\nI tell her and told her, \"Honestly, I'll take the write up if I have to. I'm not going to be threatened to be hurt by her.\" My manager understands and says she'll have to call the district manager to see what happens. \n\nI talk to her a little bit, she is on the phone with the customer apologizing saying she'll have another driver out there with the correct amount of change. And I ask her, \"So what now?\"\n\n\"Well, you're going to get written up. Technically could be fired for this and I know you don't want that.'\n\n\"I don't, but I can't even call the cops on her if she does that right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nShe reassures me that the write up wouldn't be a big deal and that it would be for 'attitude' but I'm like, whatever. I felt sick the rest of the night which caused me to be SUPER sweet to all my other customers--because I didn't want one bad apple to spoil what is usually an enjoyable quick paced job. \n\nBut, what bothers me a bit is: I remember during training that if a driver feels unsafe we have the right to leave or not delivery...wouldn't that apply here? \n\nAlso: My manager did tell me what I could have done instead of, I could have given her a dollar or drove back to store retrieved the right change etc. But I told her honestly after she threatened me I just...I couldn't. Usually I'm pretty damn good thinking on my feet and trying to make the customer happy but the moment someone threatens to attack me I just don't care anymore. ",

I tell him (and mispronounce the name while I'm at it). General policy is not to go inside but he offered and the wind was freezing cold. So, Im waiting just inside the door while he sends a kid off to get the person who ordered. It takes a minute. \n\nA guy comes down. Tells me he's not paying for it. We brought the order earlier and it was entirely wrong. 1 pizza when they ordered 2, and the pizza wasn't even right!\n\nI didn't remember an order going out there earlier so I offered to call the manager. While I'm doing so they tell me more. The order was 25 but they said they paid 17 for the one pizza. They tried to tell the driver it was wrong but all he did was list the reasons why it was how much it was. Told me that he just wouldn't listen. But also that he did get there much earlier than we quoted (we were running 50 mins to an hour). \n\nI'm trying to tell the manager what's wrong, that someone came out with their order earlier and it's completely wrong and he has no idea what I'm talking about, the guy goes upstairs to get it and it takes a minute for him to get back down. He says the box was from pizza hut. \n\nI work for mazzios. They didn't order from pizza hut. They have no idea why they have a pizza from pizza hut.\n\nThe guy is extremely apologetic, pays me and gives a decent tip and I tell the manager, never mind, that it's from pizza hut and he just laughs and hangs up. \n\nIt was an interesting delivery.

I ended up not paying him because I had no way of confirming if he was lying to get me to pay twice, it made no sense that he would show up with the pizza and a bill if my card was declined. I had to go to my computer, check my account and email, and nothing showed up saying my order was cancelled. How could they possibly send the pizza to my house if the payment was not made, it just makes zero sense. My question is has anyone had any experience like this, and if so should I have paid the delivery man? I looked it up and found some posts, but I know there is money in the account so it's not like that. If the order shows up on my bill I will be contacting a lawyer about this, absolutely ridiculous.",

Anyway, I got there in less than 30 minutes even though I couldn't see shit and got stuck for a couple minutes and knew my tip was considerably low. This happened a few times, every online tip was much lower than the others. \n\nI just find this to be \"unfair\", I guess. I feel like a tip should be determined based on how fast the driver was, how bad the roads are, etc. But these online tips don't even give the driver a chance to earn a higher tip...\n\nPeople who weren't tipping from their phone would open their front door, see the snow coming down hard, realize I was still there in less than 25 minutes, and adjust their tip accordingly thanking me for driving in bad conditions. This seems so much more reasonable.\n\n\nIdk, just had to rant for a second. Does anyone else store do this? Do you like it?",

Apparently, I'm beyond rude and I need to be fired, according to customer? \n\nI never get complaints. Its been years since the last.\n\nAnyway, this girl places an order to the Home Depot. Of course the customer only gave the address. They failed to mention which business at that address they were at. Nor did they offer a full name. To make things worse, her number didn't work because a coworker hit a wrong digit when taking the order. \n\nWhen I arrived with the delivery, I discovered I was delivering to a business address. I called to find out exactly which one. (There's Home Depot and two other big box stores at this address)  Of course, no answer, because I had the wrong number. \n\n1.5 hours goes by when the girl calls looking for her food. I wasn't in the store to take the call and don't know how it went? Regardless, I'm redispatched with her   food that I've been driving around with for close to two hours, out of the hot bag, getting it nice and cold for when the inevitable call comes looking for the food. \n\nBefore leaving the store, I call the customer on the correct number to find out where she is and to apologize for the delay.\n\nAfter apologizing for the long wait, I ask if she's at Home Depot? Sounding annoyed, she says, yes, she is.  \n\nI then ask where she is in the store?\n\nHer: I'm inside.\n\nMe: Yes  Ma'am, I know, but where inside? It's a big store. \n\nHer: Just inside the door. The front door!\n\nME: The right door, or the ones to the left end?\n\nHer. The one near the end. \n\nMe: which end? There's  three front doors and there's a lot of employees. Are you at the service desk? \n\nHer: Uh, no.\n\nMe: Are you at the Contractor pickup door? \n\nHer: Jesus!  No, I'm just right inside. Just come in and I'll be standing somewhere around there.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but being a big place and all,  I'm just trying to figure out exactly where you are? \n\nGetting more exasperated, she still can't tell me which of the three front doors that's she's right inside. Or, where she is once I come in to the right door. \n\nI've got to admit, I probably could have found her, but by this point I wanted to play a little. Have a little fun with her for wasting my time. I already knew I wasn't getting tipped, and no other orders were pending by now. \n\nFinally she tells be she will be standing outside, \"Where  the damn snowblowers are. Just hurry up, this is ridiculous\" etc.  \n\nMe: O.k, I'll be over in 2-3 minutes and I'll meet you out front. However, in the future,  please make sure to tell us the name of the business and where to find you once inside. Unfortunately, we don't have time to come in and hunt down customers we may or may not find. When I don't have a full name, that can be troublesome. \n\nHer: Well, nobody asked me that when I ordered! How would I know you guys wanted to know that? All they asked for was my address! \n\nDoing my best to hide my frustration,   Yet showing no tone of agitation, I was at a loss for words.  All I could think to respond is , \"I'm sorry, but it's kind of just common sense.\"\n\nWith that, I hung up and started driving over. I get 500 feet down the road when my manager calls. She tells me the bitch  just called back irate. She doesn't want the food. She said that I was beyond rude and treated her with total disrespect. That I need to be fired, and what kind of deliver guy am I if I can't figure out how to find a customer at Home Depot? \n\nI don't know whether to be taken back. annoyed, or humored by this customer? I'm almost hoping she takes the time to write a complaint email to our Corporate offices. They might kiss her ass and send some gift certificates, but I know they'll take my side.  (We're a small local chain and I know the higher ups and am in good standing with them.)\n\nI guess you can't please them all? Some people are just too damn stupid to order delivery! ",

( It's also a very long walk from the car to the side door where the busses park, and the door is always  locked, so you really hope they answer their phone when you arrive!  Otherwise you might be making multiple 150 yard walks back to the car once you locate them.)\n\nSo tonight, I take this delivery over for 15 large cheese pizzas and some salads. Arrive at 8pm on the dot,  Sure enough, nobody answers my calls on arrival. I park, make the trek to the building and start hunting.  I try the basketball courts first, as I hear the yelling and cheering.\n\nGet in there, and there's like four different teams. I make my way through the crowds and start asking if anybody's placed an order for 8pm delivery? The first two teams, nobody knows anything. I get to the third, and people are getting very excited with the game. I try to ask somebody who looks like they're a coach, or with the team, if they are expecting pizza?  They get out a yes, but she immediately turns her back and start yelling out and cheering on the players. The head coach is jumping up and down excitedly yelling at the players.\n\nThen this women basically leaves me standing there for a minute or two. Turns her back and walks away. Back to jumping up and down and yelling at the players.   Hesitantly,  I go up to her again, tell her I've been here for over ten minutes trying to find them, and ask if they want their food? She tells me yes, but I have to wait! They're in overtime! She's not nice about it, either. She's acting completely annoyed that I arrived when they asked us to. Like I'm interrupting them. \n\nIt's already been 17 minutes since I arrived.   I have other deliveries waiting at the store and it's almost time to go home after ten hours.  Usually, I'm a kiss ass, but this time I told her I can't wait.  She doesn't like this! Wrinkles her nose at me, huffs, then drops everything and goes back to yelling at the players. Finally she comes back, hurriedly gets in her purse to find her credit card, and throws it at some older guy on the bench to pay me, telling him, \"Take care of this kid\". (I'm 36 years old.)\n\nSame thing. He sighs, rthen asks me to wait a minute because they're in over time. I tell him, \"I'm sorry, but I've been here 15 minutes and I can't wait. I've got a car full of deliveries\"  He's also pissy with me as we walk out into the hall to the side door. He can  barely even wait. No sooner then we get to the door, he's running back to the courts telling me to, \"just hold on a minute!\"  The fans are going crazy!  I can barle hear.\n\nWell,  just then, the side door slams behind me. Locked shut! I now have to walk another 150 yards,  all the way around the building and back through the halls to the back where the gym is. I find the guy again and get him to pay.  He's telling me he doesn't know why I can't just wait a minute so the woman with the card can come pay.  Again, I explain I'm sorry, but I've been here 15 minutes with a 8pm delivery and I have other orders waiting at the store.\n\nHe begrudgingly tips me $15, and before I can even thank him, he's back to the game. Door shut in my face with three bags of pizza at my feet. Luckily, their team bus is in the parking lot. I know from past experience that's where the food is usually going, so I go over and ask the driver if I had the right bus? I did, so I dropped the food off and got the hell out of there!\n\nWhile I like the tips on these orders, I dread hunting the customer down! What really makes me crazy though, is when every once in a while... (O.k., too often) I get over there and the game isn't quite done, and whoever is paying expects me to wait around patiently!!  \n\nIt's like what gives?  Are these people so anal retentive that they don't realize they're not the only customer waiting for their delivery? That I make my living doing this, and my tips depend on food arriving on time?  Who the hell asks the delivery driver to wait on them? Especially for a timed delivery? \n\nI know college deliveries are not a lot of driver's favorites. But does anybody have experiences such as this at the college? Not just dealing with poor college kids that are too stupid to order a pizza, but dealing with sports teams and their adult coaches who expect you to wait on them? \n\nAnd it's like what do you do? If you show any sign of being annoyed, they're going to call the store and say you were rude.  If you actually take the food back to the store, the manager is going to be pissed you brought $200 of food back instead of waiting a few more minutes.  Re going to send you back with it a second time, and you're definetly not getting tipped then.\n\nDamned if you do. Damned if you don't.  ",

        "text": "Weeks days during non-rush hours are always a crawl, but the few orders you get are gems.\n\nI had the phone ring, gave the answering schpeel just in case it was the boss doing a random check, and then heard a female voice say something followed by the sound of someone dropping thier phone. Wrong number I guess, whatever. Then like a minute later the number calls again so I pick it up and give the schpeel. The lady asks for a pepperoni and I coax out the usual stuff like \"what size\" \"delivery or carryout?\" \"Where will we be taking this?\" When we get to the third question she gives my a house number but stalls on the street. I hear her calling out to someone else in the house asking about the address and she tells me that she needs a second to figure out the address. Great. So I sit there in silence for a minute as we get a call on another line that my AM takes. Then two minutes, then 5. After my AM finishes her phone order I hear someone move then phone and I get hung up on. I look at the address in the order that just popped up and I notice that it has the same number the lady I was talking to knew; she just had her friend call in the stinking order and forgot to end the call with me!\n\nWell at least when I got to her door with the pizza she didn't stiff me.",

We said it sounds like a plan and we all watched the game, he was a really cool guy and told him we could call him Pizza Steve, even though his name is Pete. Me and Pete hang out for the next couple of months, my girlfriend says we need a break because we haven't been talking much, I told her that was obviously a fake excuse but she insisted otherwise, go to hang out with Pete. Find my girlfriends music hat (beanie with speakers in the ear holes) tell him that my girl has one just like it, he almost cried and told me he had been sleeping with my girlfriend for a week. Me and Pete both agreed to leave her and we still talk today, he is no longer Pizza Steve but Pharmacist Pete.  ",

        "text": "We all have those delivery nightmare stories, where it's almost too unreal to believe. There's a saying I always tell new drivers I'm training, and it goes \"You never know what's going to be behind that door\". Here's a story of one of my worst delivery experiences in my 5 years of delivering pizza.\n\nThe story begins with a delivery at 2 pm. The store is dead slow and I'm reduced to chain smoking in the back out of boredom. My manager comes back to inform me of the delivery, and that he knows exactly who ordered it. He tells me that this is a problem customer that has consistently complained about her order upon arrival, demanding her bill be comped after inspecting the pie. The complaint you may ask? Her order is a single large pizza with triple pepperoni, and upon delivery she demands that there be not one single square inch of pizza not covered by greasy goodness. She see's a bit of cheese peaking out? Obviously not triple pepperoni, and she obviously deserves this pizza to be completely comped on the spot.\n\nSo begins our story, with a triple pepperoni pizza coming out of the oven, the boxing and cutting of which results in grease burns all over my hands as a result of the gallons of oil produced by the triple layered nastiness that is this pizza. As I walk out the store my boss gives me the good luck nod accompanied by a delivery destined for disaster, and I go on my journey to Mount Doom.\n\nAs I arrive at the house, conveniently only 2 minutes from our store, I see the tell tale signs of a customer I don't want to deal with. A rotten lawn, a crooked porch, a doorbell ripped from a wall, and an ashtray overflowing with cigarettes. I knock on the door and am greeted with a horrifying women, overweight and far past the time any human should go without a shower.\n\nAnd so it begins... ( I'm switching to dialogue now to make my life easier )\n\nCustomer: Lemme see it\n\nDriver: Hey there, how are you doing? It's going to be $17.54\n\nCustomer: I'm not paying till I see it!\n\nDriver: Ok then... (hands over the pizza)\n\nCustomer: I see cheese here... I ordered triple pepperoni, there shouldn't be any cheese showing! (she's yelling and pointing at a spot of cheese a quarter in size)\n\nDriver: Well I'm sorry about that, but it's going to be $17.54.\n\nCustomer: I'm not paying for it because it's not what I ordered!\n\nDriver: Well give me the pizza back, and I'll cancel the order for you, or I'll remake it.\n\nCustomer: No!! This should be free!! You fucked up my order and you need to make this right!!! I'm not paying for this!\n\nAt this point something happened which had never happened before... This bitch took the pizza and slammed the door in my face. At this point I furiously hammered on the door, and yelled at her that I would be calling the police right away, and that she would be arrested for theft. After a minute of banging on the door, she opened it.\n\nDriver: Give me the fucking pizza or pay for it right now.\n\nCustomer: I need to eat, I have to feed my son, he has to go soon and needs to eat.\n\nDriver: Not my fucking problem, pay up or I'm calling the police.\n\nAt this point she gives me a $20 bill, and I in turn give her $2 in change. As I begin to storm off she shrieks at me, \"you're stealing my money!!! you owe me 46 cents!!!\". So I go to my car, fish out 50 cents, give it to her and remark \"Good for you, you saved 4 cents!\". At this point I get in my car and peel out of crazy town.\n\nUpon arrival to my store, I informed my manager of the shit I just had to go through, and I got her address and phone number black listed from our store. These are the kind of deliveries that make you a stronger and unshakable driver.",

More often than not my store doesn't ask for mistakes back when we go to deliver a new one, which is kinda scummy since nine times out of ten, the people asking for new pizzas are hoodrats who just want an extra pizza for free. We should ask them for the original pizza back and if they don't give it to us, we should just say \"nope\" and go back to the store, but that's just me angrily venting. ",
