I have an interview tomorrow to work at a discount store 25 walking minutes away, I know it isn’t the most glamorous, but I’m taking it as an opportunity to suck up those rather depressing thoughts, and channel my dejection by hopefully one day being able purchase a new car that’ll act a physical representation of what I am capable of even in moments of doubt.

        "text": "So, I bought my first car ever about two months ago, a 2004 Peugeot 307 2.0HDi.\nI study software engineering but my true love is in machines with actual gears, like cars, boats, planes, bikes etc.\nI'm also a huge fan of racing and all types of driving in general. I enjoy my job (I'm a delivery guy) because I get to spend time just driving and listening to music.\nSo, back to my car, I was with my friends hanging out and I decided to do a quick fix (a common problem on my car is trunk opening button getting stuck and the trunk opening every time the car is unlocked because of it), it was like a 10 min job. \nSo, when I got that done I wanted to remove the plastic that covers my engine. I wanted to do this because I just like to see the bare engine like I do on my family's VW Passat. When I got the plastic cover off, I was absolutely shocked by what was under it.\nThere were pipes everywhere leaving both me and my friends in the \"What the f*ck\" mode. Like, Peugeot engineers made the engine be behind the fuel pump and all the other hoses, but I expected the engine to be right in front of me when I open my hood, making it a little easier to work on and a bazillion times better looking. So, the engine is almost under the windshield of my car. I find it really funny because the front of the car is bigger than average, giving engineers more space to fit the engine neatly. Also, they made so that car has two oil caps, where the main one is under the plastic cover and there is a second one in the centre of the cover that has a pipe that leads to the engine head. I've never seen anything like this before, and I hope engineers actually have a really good explanation for that.\nAt the end I just screwed on the cover because I didn't want to look at that abomination anymore.",

I’ve had all of these life goals I’ve wanted to achieve but having no visible progress for any of them has been a bit discouraging.\n\nDespite all that, today has felt like the best day for me mentally since summer last year when I went to a friend’s wedding and reunited with old college buddies. Receiving well wishes from people today in person, on social media, through messenger and text have all just felt so comforting and reassuring enough.\n\nLike, these people care enough about me and I’ve made enough of an impact in their lives to where they want to go out of their way to wish me well. I’m constantly the friend that’s checking in on others when possible so to get some of that int return feels so worthwhile and appreciated. It just feels nice to be remembered.\n\nI think year 27 for me on this earth is gonna be a weird but good one.

Maybe, but I'm responsible enough to hope I won't do anything too idiotic. \n\nAny ideas on what I should do to take advantage of the opportunity while drunk in between measurements? Listen to music loud? Watch a comedy?

Considering the fact that I am very academically skilled, combined with my attitude, I became a person that was perfectly unrelatable and out of reach. \n\nI started to truly heal and accept change in 2020 and while it was hard to let go out my \"facade of invincibility\", I feel like my life has become so much more enjoyable since I can be just myself with all my facets. And I have found out how nice it feels to have people notice me as a real and relatable person.

He told me that he thought I was gorgeous since the first day of class, but was too shy to ask for my number. I told him I could tell he's shy, and asked if he only thought I was attractive because of my breasts (just joking.) Of course he said no, but he was blushing and laughing, so I got him to admit that they're nice. It was cute. \n\nAnyway, I asked if he'd like to spend time together later this week and he said yes. We've been texting a lot this weekend and it's been very interesting getting to know him. I'm excited! Maybe if it goes well I'll initiate a first kiss.\n\nIn the past I've always been the one to initiate or make the first move. Honestly, I love it. It's so scary yet so fun. Absolutely exhilarating.

Sometimes when it would be his weekend for me to visit he would have to work (he was a hospital administrator before retiring) and I would tag along with him to the hospitals. \n\nIt should go without saying that I would get bored so I would wander off and just start talking to random patients, lol. I would just sit there with them and listen to their stories about why they were there, about life, and just whatever they wanted to talk about. \n\nAt first I thought it was all about me just selfishly wanting not to be bored, but over time I realized that the reason they were talking with me was because it was bringing  joy to them as well. Hospitals are lonely places, and as sad as it is few people take the time to talk to people who are unwell (be it mentally, physically or, emotionally). \n\nI learned very early on how impactful it can be for a person to engage with someone else in a real and meaningful way, so that is why I have always strived to listen to the voices and stories of another. Sometimes just being yourself can bring meaning to another's life. I dig that.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have been out of the gym or any major physical activity for the past few years (outside of walking and the occasional workout every few months). Work takes so much of my time and energy. By the end of the day I'm too tired to do anything other than sleep. \n\nI really want to go back to the gym and my only realistic option is having early morning workouts. However, if I recall correctly, when I last tried working out in the morning a few years ago I felt tired, hot (as in sweaty and feeling overly warm) and hungry the whole day. Additionally, I felt my mind wasn't as sharp as it used to be (my job requires a lot of focus and concentration). \n\nObviously, the easy answer is to give it a shot and see how it goes. I would appreciate if anyone could share their experiences or advice regarding the matter. Also would like to know if anyone had tried it out, if it would be possible to eventually get used to it (be able to focus more or not feel as tired during the day). Thank you.",

But it always crushes my soul a bit when I have a particular friend I like or bond really well.....and then they introduce me to another person or talk about them like their bond is closer than ours.\n\n\nIt makes sense. They have history with each other. For example I have a friend I met in high school and I consider us close. We have another mutual friend together. But then I recently found out this mutual friend isn't just another friend from high school, no, they both go way back from elementary school. Even though I talk to both of them together, it turns out they have separate conversations together (of course since theyre friends with each other too but they have a whole middle school group chat that I'm not a part of as well).\n\nI know this sounds dumb of me to be jealous of \"oh omg! My friend has another friend!\". It's hust that.....I never had a childhood friend or someone with history. I never belonged in a groupie. But others do and they have a certain bond that I feel like I shouldnt interfere with. :(\n\n\nI got invited to a wedding and I was thrilled I was even considered as close enough to witness her ceremony! But she has a close groupie and they are all chosen as bridesmaid. It just makes me feel left out as like.... I'm the \"other friend\".\n\nHow do I get over this?",

It wasn’t like my world was going to crumble if I couldn’t do anything about it. He gave me a sunscreen sample and told me that was the best I could do. I made an appointment with a different dermatologist a week or so ago and had a great appointment with a young woman physicians assistant. She addressed the redness around my nose and into the eyebrows. She identified several small features to keep an eye on. I’m so used to having reddish skin around my nose and I just live with it. She prescribed three creams and my face looks better already. One of them will help reduce the age spots as well as make the skin more elastic and healthy. Sounds good to me. I wanted to say that if you ever have an encounter with a doctor that doesn’t feel completely kosher - if you leave feeling unheard - you should look into a second opinion. The first Dr was very pleasant but had me out the door quickly. I don’t think his intentions were bad but it would have been nice to have had these three prescription creams suggested to me. You really do have to be your own advocate. And I’m aware we live in a society (USA) that easily clings to medication‘s for all things, and probably too much too often. But right now my skin LOOKS BETTER and healthier. That means something.",

At first it was a little salty, but then I added some vinegar to tame it down then it was fantastic.

But this one float was really cool, the parade had stopped so there could be a chicken run and lunch break( basically they just chase a chicken around and it’s supposed to get cooked later) and we were kind of dancing to the music they had and they threw us beads. they decided to throw a really big bead for my little sister, who caught it, then they threw big beads to all of us as well. They were really nice and smiling, and we were saying thank you and all that, and they were being so nice, I even said at one point that they were the nicest float we had seen, and the girl who I said it to on the float was so kind. They even gave me a bead so I could give it to my mom! ( she works nights in a NICU) it was a very nice Mardi Gras for me, and I just wanted to share it.",

On top of that, my mother was the type to chat away (2 hr. phone call with salesman...story for another time I think lol), she was a talker and some of that rubbed off on me, I think.\n\nWhen I'm out and about I don't talk to everyone, if I see a bag/dress/hair color/etc. I like, I will comment to the person \"Oh love your dress, so pretty!\" and people light up. If waiting in line, I may talk to another person waiting to pass the time. My partner finds it rather odd/embarrassing when I talk to strangers.

Basically what I learned is that once you own an NFT people have to pay you to use that piece of art, so if they want to use it for anything you have the right to charge them for it. That is probably why it is so beneficial to be an artist and make NFTs because you literally get to own the rights to your own art on the web. It is basically like copyrighting I am pretty sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you know any more than I do please feel free to inform me about how NFTs work.
