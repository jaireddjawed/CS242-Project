Saturn: Has beautiful rings and beautiful on the outside\n\n  9. Jupiter: My favorite gas giant and has a cool storm and color and nice size.\n\n  Note All gas giants are beautiful but rank low as being a gas planet not very explorable or of usw lol\n\n  8. Ceres: The only dwarf planet besides pluto on the list mostly because of its 1 crater with a massive light I want to see.\n\n 7. Pluto: Yes the next dwarf is up next with a beautiful ice world.\n\n 6. Venus: although my dislike for planets that look the same all around venus brakes this with its beautiful golden color.\n\n 5. Ganymede and Callisto: Both tied because I forgot about another moon and I think they are equal in beauty and interest\n\n4. Tritan: 100% the tourist attraction of the solar system not somewhere I would want to live ignoring the deadly parts but a nice vacation\n\n3. Earth: Earth is amazing and we have so much to explore and could be number one but thats kinda basic if you do that its cool tho.\n\n The top 2 are phenomenal and hard to choose.\n\n 2. Titan: basically a yellow golden earth with so much to see and so much variety its great.\n\n1. Europa yes titan may be way more beautiful, way more to see, also needed for scientist. However, Europa I believe is the most important thing in our solar system we should study. I feel here lies many answers and stories.\n\n \n Top 3 dislike:\n\n  3. All satallites that look like moon is as bland as it can get.\n \n  2. Io looks like a barf bag,\n\n  1.  Mars all scientist may hate my answer but extremely overrated and I feel like its only cuz its the closest to us that we can study. I think it is extremely ugly and a huge downgrade. I know as someone wanting to get  into astronomy I should be excited about life on mars etc. I am kinda however, I hope we keep going after because im more intrested in all the other planets.",

The ISS doesn't really have these problems so we know it's possible, and the fact that it's in LEO meaning a skeevy astronaut could still be arrested and held accountable is probably a large factor in that. \n\nBut what about outside of Earth's gravity well? There's light lag between us and the Moon and especially Mars where the lag is upwards of 20 minutes one-way so what do we do if some clown of an astronaut decides to become a real-life Impostor? What do we do then?\n\nWould Earth law even apply on the Moon or Mars?",

So I don't really have a set of questions ready to say all at once, so I'm gonna need a reliable person that can answer my questions over a course of a couple of days. I know it might seem like I'm lazy and greedy, but I need the 1st place prize in this competition and the questions are these types of questions google won't answer easily.\n\nTLDR; I need a person that can answer mildly complicated questions that google won't easily answer.",
