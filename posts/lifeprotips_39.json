        "text": "LPT Recently I was driving in CA and a pickup truck passed me going the wrong direction on the highway at a super high speed. We were very lucky we didn’t get hit. Usually on US highways there is a mile marker every 1/10 of a mile and this can be used to identify your location on the highway. When speaking to 911 I told them our direction and mile marker and they were able to arrest the individual, which turned out to be a DUI. I found this out after CHP (California Highway Patrol) called me a few days later to get information to use against the individual in court. They told me people rarely think to get the mile marker or they don’t know how to find it, and so I thought I would share with random people on the internet in the hopes of preventing future accidents.\n\nSide note- exit numbers off highways also correspond to the mile markers in the US",

This is your clutch control point, where it “bites”. Press your clutch all the way in again, then repeat the process 10 times until you know exactly where to stop each time.\n\nNow do it again, but hold the clutch control point.\n\nVery slowly start pressing the accelerator until you feel the car begin to active strain against the handbrake, then hold the accelerator there, and your clutch still at the same point, and drop the handbrake.\n\nYou will now start moving up the hill. Start giving some more gas, but don’t overdo it (engine will sound like it’s trying to go to the moon if you do, then back off a little). \n\nOnce you’re steadily moving with some momentum, entirely release the clutch in a fluid and gentle motion.\n\nAccelerate some more, until the engines is getting a little rowdy (revs are high), then you can gear up: \n\nClutch in, second gear, bring your clutch up to the control point while keeping the accelerator steady, hold for a second until the car is moving comfortably, then release your clutch and start giving gas.\n\nThis process helps you feel the car a lot better, and makes you a lot less likely to stall than “just slowly let go of the clutch and accelerate”.\n\nFor a bonus challenge, try a hill start in second gear with the same principle, you’ll have less power so you’ll need some more gas and your clutch control point will be different, but if you can manage that, you’ve really gotten to understand the clutch of your vehicle.\n\nGood luck!",

I bought a replacement ring for my wife for Christmas that is white gold plated silver with 3 carats of moissanite for less than $200. My wife gets compliments all the time and loves it! \n\nMoissanite is very similar in durability to diamonds - the main difference is there is a slight increase brillance, which combines with the cut to have a more prasmatic appearance. My wife actually likes all the bright colorful sparkles better and you don’t notice any difference to a diamond unless you are looking right at a large high quality diamond next to it. Previously moissanite had a yellow color but now they make ones that are pretty much as colorless as a diamond. Also, Moissanite is synthetic and not mined and/or related to conflict, which makes it more desirable for some people. Obviously some fiancees may feel buying a diamond is a tradition and/or a symbol of not being cheap, but IMO there is no reason people should spend 3 months salary on an engagement ring when you could buy a huge solid gold moissanite ring for a fraction of the price. A moissanite ring will last just as long and sparkle pretty much the same amount. \n\n[https://www.brides.com/moissanite-vs-diamond-5094238](https://www.brides.com/moissanite-vs-diamond-5094238)",

Most often, you won't end up with a cart that limps, wobbles, squeaks, pulls to one side, or is difficult to push.
