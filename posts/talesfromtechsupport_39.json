        "text": "I posted this on FB at the beginning of the year and am sad I didn't think of here first. \n\n\n\n\n**BACKGROUND**  \n\nI just got hired by **$ITFirm** to run two depts in IT for a financial services company (**$FINSRV**). They send two techs from a contracting firm (**$TEMP1** and **$TEMP2**) for initial setup help because I am currently the only IT person in the office of over 150 people, and this needs to be done by next Monday apparently. \nThey have no servers, no machines, no desks, nothing at this point. Everything is delivered on TUESDAY and I supposedly have to unbox all the infrastructure (while **$MAINT** is setting up power to the suite, as well as the desks; **$CABLING** company is running/ installing the racks/jacks/cabling/panels), install the servers in the racks, set everything up, then unbox and set up around 160 user machines.   \nRealizing that this was pretty much impossible in the time they allotted for it, they sent me temporary help from 3 hours away. :|\n\n\nSo... it's WED, I have the servers installed, I'm on bridge calls with about ten people trying to finish configs and setups, and there are **$TECH1** and **$TECH2** plugging away outside the network/server room, unboxing and setting up machines. I'm under the gun, understaffed, don't have the infrastructure in place yet to even get this done, and every time I walk past the training room which has 9 machines to be set up in it, **$TECH2** is texting, and messing around on his phone, or staring off into space. **$TECH1** has the suite unboxed by 10am, and a bunch of machines fully set up by noon. **$TECH2** however, is in a training room of 9 machines that I unboxed before they came that morning. He didn't finish setting up the 5th machine by the end of the day.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**EPIC OKEY-DOKE**  -please forgive the formatting, I just copied it from FB with minimal changes    \n\n\n\n\nI don't normally enjoy being an ass to people just to be mean. I have no qualms with doing it when it's needed. However... today I HAD to; and I admit, I did it in a manner that I enjoyed a little.   \nI have an employee who just...doesn't...listen. yesterday I had him setting up workstations in a training room, it took him 8 hours to plug in 5 computers and set them up. I told him about 10 times he needed to be doing things a lot faster. He asks the same question 3 times after I just told him the answer, and I watch him on his phone for 20 minutes at a time after I tell him to put it away.   \nSo... I fired **$TECH2**. Got ahold of his contracting company and arranged someone else to show up today, and last night told **$TECH2** we won't be needing him anymore. I was nice about it, didn't allude to him being deficient or anything of the sort.   \n\n\nBut today, **$TECH2** shows up for work. I'm dumbfounded for a bit. Like... really? Then it dawns on me, I suppose I had to tell him everything yesterday 3 times, I don't know why this would be any different. So I tell him this morning, nicely...     \n\n\n&gt;\"we don't need you anymore. Your company sent us someone else. Sorry but 'thems the breaks'. Wish you luck, do you need help gathering your things? \"  \n\n\nMade it pretty clear. \n\n\nHe says:\n\n&gt;\"well I was contracted for at least three days work\".   \n\n\n\nI tell him we only needed him for one and we have someone else now. He actively ignores me and asks a question about the work. So I tell him (at this point i'm getting a little annoyed), \n  \n\n\n&gt;\"this is no longer your concern. We have someone else on the project and I can't have anyone who isn't cleared by security on this floor. So please gather your things and I'll show you out if you need me to.\"   \n\n\n\n\n\nHe stares off into space then says he's missing his knife. So I walk around and help him find it, then he stands there and starts trying to talk to the new guy **$TECH3** who's watched most of this conversation. **$TECH3** and **$TECH1** blow him off and **$TECH2** walks over to where his things are and putz's around for another 5 minutes, and looks like he is just killing time so he can bill his Contracting company. I can almost hear the sound of my boss' butthole tightening at the lost time and wages of this whole debacle. I.E. This guy just milking my time, and his own, when so much is yet to get done, SO a solution pops in my head. \n\n\nI stand up with purpose and make it a production, and say   \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"ya know what? I have an Idea! Grab your stuff quick and come with me.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n He gets a little excited like he's somehow convinced me to put him back to work. I walk to the door of our suite with him and I step out and point to a locked door on the other side of the floor. And as he walks out, I kick the prop out from under the door we just exited and step inside. Then I stand there silently as it closes super slowly. It's almost completely glass. Once it closed I took a moment to stand there and watch the whole reality of what just happened set in. I watched **$TECH2's** facial expressions change as he went from hopeful albeit willfully ignorant, to disappointed, to mad, when he realized I just tricked him into walking out the door so I could close it behind him. I smiled, I admit.\n\n\nPart of my brain tells me I should feel bad, but this guy wasted one full day of three days I have to get this project done. So nope. I don't. \n**THE END**\n\n**EDIT**: Trying to make the format more readable. Apologies. ",

As my manager and I were doing our usual tasks of closing terminating frozen processes and checking for locked DB tables, we get called into one of the meeting rooms by the local office's Financial Administrator. Also important to note that Microsoft had sent out a Win10 update about a day or two before.\n\nAs soon as we walk in he starts venting on how he's been waiting a whole **5 MINUTES** for the computer to start working and that he had planned to log on 8 minutes early in order to avoid any hang ups like these. He asked if he could just turn the computer off then back on again.\n\nBy this point my manager and I just look at each other and proceed to  explain that after new crucial/important updates the computer needs a bit of time to finish applying said updates. Not even a second after this explanation, **BAM** the Financial Admins desktop comes up.\n\nNot wanting to lose face the Admin starts going off about wanting to turn off Windows Updates on meeting room computers because you know, they're so inconvenient. Again, we explain that these updates are important and while we could turn them off it is not recommended. He gives an annoyed look and then as if nothing happened starts his meeting, basically dismissing us.\n\nNice to know we are highly valued...",

        "text": "I’d been a part of our Intermediate Maintenance department for about a year or so when I was asked for my very first time to assist with a gear change on an MD88 one evening.  I was rather excited, so I hurried down to Bay 3 where the guys were already getting set up to test the alignment of the landing gear door position sensor targets. \n\n The sensors are magnetic devices which sense when the target, a piece of steel, is in proximity to it, signaling whatever it is attached to is closed.  If they’re not properly aligned, the sensors will not sense the target and you might not get important signals such as “Gear up and locked” or “Gear Extended.”  Which means a crew member needs to run to the center of the cabin, pull up on the floor covering and look at a little peephole periscope  to see if the gear are in the proper position for that phase of flight.  \n\nTo test the door sensor, one has to sit in the landing gear area and close the door.  I’d just completed my training on this aircraft and one of the important things pointed out specifically about this plane was when doing this very test, make sure you use the special ‘seat’ tool which extends from the forward side of the gear bay to the aft side.  If you don’t use this tool, and just sit in the door, you run the risk of popping the door open and falling out of the belly of the plane.  Even the aircraft manual says to use it, for this very reason.  When I arrived on the scene to help, a fellow we’ll call $Bob was prepping to ride the door and sit on it.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Hey, shouldn’t you use the seat-tool, $Bob?”\n\n&gt;**$Bob**  “That’s just a waste of time, we don’t need it.”\n\nBeing the junior mechanic I just shrugged and received my assignment: I would run up to the flight deck and operate the hydraulics system.  I grabbed my radio from my tool box and went forward to do as I was told.  \n\nIt was a few minutes before $Bob was ready, so when they signaled me to kick on the hydraulics I did so immediately.  After a few seconds, I saw the door system signal it had closed so I stepped out to watch.  As I stood directly outside the aircraft door on the stair stand, I couldn’t quite see what was going on but I suddenly heard an unmistakable *THUNK* and saw $Bob suddenly spill out onto the floor.  I ran back into the plane and switched the system back off before hurrying out to the gear bay to assess the situation.  \n\nBefore I’d gotten more than a few steps, one of the guys started yelling to call 911, and I saw the giant gash down $Bob’s shin.  I turned around and sprinted over to the first aid box on the wall, snatched out every bit of gauze I could find and a pair of gloves.  I sprinted back carrying my bounty to find another mechanic holding a bunch of oil rags covered in dry sweep against the gash in $Bob’s leg to stop the bleeding.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Get that $#!% off his leg!  Hold his ankle for me!”\n\nOne of my (many) additional duties in the Army had been \"Combat Life Saver.\"  It meant I was someone who was capable of providing immediate response to someone who was injured beyond the very basic first aid we're given in basic, but below direct need of a Combat Medic or higher to intervene immediately.  I'd drilled myself relentlessly in the required knowledge and procedures, but while they'd come in handy for some exercises I'd never had to respond to an actual injury before.  \n\n\nI used one piece of gauze to wipe the debris from his leg and then examined it for a moment.  The up-latch on the gear door had a very sharp corner, which had sliced both his pants and his shin wide open.  Because of the sort of tightness of the skin around the calf muscles, the skin had pulled open and revealed quite a bit of muscle which thankfully had received very little damage itself.  I finished my evaluation and slapped a large gauze bandage against the wound and started wrapping his leg with a roll of gauze.  As I was finishing with the first roll and starting on my second, my $Lead arrived and asked what I needed.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “More gauze!  More gauze and a cart!”\n\nThe gauze arrived swiftly as my last roll ran out and I went through several more finishing the tight wrap around his leg, creating a pressure dressing.  We lifted him to a flatbed cart and drove him to meet the arriving ambulance crew and Police first responders, who took one look at his leg, nodded, and then loaded him into the ambulance.  \n\nAbout thirty seconds later, my adrenaline crashed and I became a sort of zombie for about an hour—and in this poor, confused and slightly shaky state I was introduced to $MEKMike (MEK=Methyl Ethyl Keytone—really nasty, nasty stuff.)  who informed me he was a Base Maintenance safety rep, was impressed by my response and wanted to talk to me.  Once he got me back into his cube, he began talking….\n\n&gt;**$MEKMike**  *after ten minutes of blabbing* “…So I soaked my feet in it [edit: a water bath--he used to wash himself in MEK all the time, thus thr name....] for a few hours and the water turned black!  I was never all right after working in the paint shop for so long….You should try it!  It’ll make you a new man!”\n\nAfter extricating myself from the crazy, I reported back to my $Lead who then told me our Department Manager wanted to talk to me.  When I popped into his office he promptly informed me, in front of the rest of the Leads and Duty Managers, that I would be our department’s new safety rep.  \n\nAs for $Bob?  When he got back to work a couple weeks later, he came over and thanked me and apologized for not listening to my concern with the seat.  And then showed me the pretty cool scar he was developing.  \n\n***\n*A few months later, I would be at a safety rep meeting where I met our new Department Manager.  He was livid about how many aircraft damages there had been lately and [informed us of his intent to make an example of the next one.]( https://redd.it/7ngnh9)*\n\n*The full collection of stories [can be found here.](https://redd.it/7i0esb)*",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I felt like sharing, and I thought y’all might enjoy. \n\nI don’t work as tech support, but I’m known around my workplace as being at least marginally competent around tech thanks to a year of network support classes at the local community college. Most of the time people just ask small favours. One guy in particular-we’ll call him Jim-has asked for some help from time to time-wiping an old laptop before selling, fixing odd driver issues, virus scans, etc. He’s a good friend, and usually competent enough with computers to get by, but sometimes he missed the obvious things. \n\nWell, yesterday, Jim asked for some more help than usual. He asked me if I would be willing to set up his new surround sound system for his entertainment center. He just got it for Christmas, but he couldn’t get it to work. He got all new cables, adaptors, splitters, fancy gold plated stuff and everything-but he still couldn’t seem to get it to work. At this point I figured that it was some kind of calibration problem, or maybe his tv didn’t support surround. Regardless, I agreed to meet him at his house and try to help him out. \n\nI got to his house after waiting a couple hours for his shift to finish, and he led me into the living room to inspect the system. Turns out, this fancy “surround sound system” he was so excited about, was in fact, a sound bar with a subwoofer. Anyway, no big deal, I should still be able to get some sound out of it. I checked the back of the bar-yup, all the connectors look good, everything is plugged in the right spot, no obvious problem there. Alright, let’s check the connections on the other end. Pull the tv out from the wall, look around, yup, this all looks goo-huh, what’s that power plug lying on the floor over there? Yup. That would be the power plug for the sound bar. Funny enough, they don’t seem to work without power, who’d a thunk it? Trying to prevent myself from facepalming, and not wanting to make Jim feel like an idiot, at this point I pulled out my flashlight, shone it around, muttered some buzzwords under my breath, traced some cables, unplugged/plugged in random cables, etc. for the next 5-10 minutes, just to make it seem like I’m doing something. Then I plugged in the power cable, and Voila! There was sound! Amidst many thanks, I managed to extricate myself from his house and went on my merry way, shaking my head and laughing the entire way home. \n\nI’m sure you all guessed what was wrong before I started the story(the title may have helped..), but usually I assume people are competent enough to troubleshoot at least as far as plugging it in... lesson learned I guess!

        "text": "This is a story that ended yesterday.\n\nI'm a web developer. We have a system where each week another developer gets to do the support. I got this ticket in one of my support weeks.\n\nCustomer A wasn't able to add a line to a set of data in one of our applications. This was an application that had existed for years, without any changes in that time, without any problems. The developper for this application left a month before the ticket came up, and she only gave us a very quick introduction to the app while mentioning \"you probably won't have to work in this application. It's been running properly for years\".\n\nWell, customer A had a problem and made a ticket. I opened the code, ran the project and took a look. To add a line, you get a few textboxes where you input a title, date and price, then press the save button. She got a \"input string was not in a correct format\" error, mentioning a conversion to double. Clearly a problem with inputting the price. First thing I did was sending a mail to ask if there was a problem with using a point as wel as using a comma as decimal character. I didn't get a real answer to that question, only that it was urgent.\n\nI didn't really have a lot of time to look into this project as I had a lot of other urgent work to do, but I looked into the issue from time to time, mainly trying to work out why this used to work and now suddenly stopped working. I soon found out that locally everything worked fine and on the test server it worked fine.\n\nI sent some mails to get more information. I wanted to test on the production server, as that's what she would be using, so I asked some data that she wanted to input. I didn't want to put some test data on production. I tried it, and it worked. I asked which url she was using. She responded with the correct url, and that she also tried it on someone else's laptop, with the same error message as a result.\n\nVery strange. I asked some other developers for ideas, tried to change some settings on my laptop, but I could never reproduce the error. Meanwhile my boss was getting impatient, asking about the ticket several times.\n\nOkay, I need to see what she is doing exactly, maybe look into her computer settings for some strange stuff. We agree on a day and time for a skype meeting. The time is there and she figures out how to share her screen. She goes to the app. Okay, that's the right url, so that's not the problem. She goes to the page and got to the form to add the line.\n\nNext... she presses the save button. She doesn't input anything, she just goes straight to \"save\". And she gets the error. I don't know what to say for a few seconds and quickly think about how to stay nice. \"Do you also get the error when you input your data first?\". She says \"I need to input my data first? Okay, I'll try\". She inputs the data, presses the save button, and of course that works.\n\nProblem solved!\n\nShe had been trying to add a line for a few weeks now, on several computers, with coworkers looking, and never did she or her coworkers think about inputting the data BEFORE trying to save? Also when I asked about the decimal character or the data she tried to input, she never mentioned that she never even got to the point of inputting so the data wouldn't matter. Granted the app could have been made better by catching empty values, but still.\n\nI returned to my desk. Boss asked for a status. Told him the problem was fixed. The issue being that the customer didn't realise they had to actually type in their data before saving it. Boss didn't believe me at first.\n\nTL;DR: Customer has difficulty grasping the order in which things should be done. Probably also pulls her pants back up before peeing, then wondering why her pants are wet.",

Then it just black screens and stays that way.\n\n&gt;Me: Alright, let me take a look\n\n*takes her MacBook and indeed it performs like she described*\n\n&gt;Me: Well this sure is weird, how long has this been happening for?\n\n&gt;Girl: Since last night\n\n&gt;Me: Wait a minute\n\n*puts MacBook screen under sunlight*\n\n*screen is working fine, backlight turned off*\n\n*press brightness up hotkey*\n\n&gt;Me: There we go, is there anything else?\n\n*girl shyly answers*\n\n&gt;Girl: Nothing else, thanks for your help\n\nEasily one of my easiest cases ever.",

I live out in the country, with very few neighbors.\n\nI have three wifi routers at my \"compound\", covering my house and the metal building I use as a garage and shop.  We were fiddling with wifi on one of my evil minion's devices, getting signals from two of the three routers and the few neighbors' setups, when evil minion #2 notices there's a signal with a nondescript label, and it's rather strong.  Odd, maybe one of the neighbors has a souped-up router?\n\nThen we notice that if you move in the direction the neighbors live, the signal gets weaker, not stronger.  Go outside and the signal gets much weaker.\n\nWat.\n\nOkay, load up a wifi signal strength app on our phones and start going around the house.  There are three spots in my house with lots of technology; the signal isn't as strong there as in the kitchen.  There's nothing in the kitchen that would do it.  Go towards the entrance, the signal gets stronger, then drops off.  My bedroom is off to one side of the entrance; the signal strength is strongest there.\n\nWat.\n\nOkay, I have this little computer there hooked up to the TV for watching movies.  It's powered off.  I disconnect it for good measure.  There's another laptop there, which I use mostly for reading ~~r/talesfromtechsupport and r/HFY~~ ebooks.  I power that off and unplug it.  Signal's still there.  I also have an old tablet.  Power that down too.  Even unplugged the TV.  Still there.\n\nWat.\n\nWracking my brain at anything that might be broadcasting a wifi signal...  I'm pretty sure that hasn't been on the list that long...  What the heck could be wireless...  ...  Naw, that'd be silly.  Couldn't be...\n\nI unplugged the bed.\n\nAbout a month earlier I'd bought one of those nifty motion beds, that'd raise the head and legs.  It also had massage, though that wasn't a feature I thought I'd use.  (Turns out I use it more than the motion though.)  And it had this nifty wireless remote control with a display that'd show what the bed was doing.\n\nAnd the remote apparently uses wifi to talk to the bed.  When I unplugged the bed, the signal dropped.",

        "text": "I am a support tech for a 3D printer manufacturer. I was reminded of this story today and thought I would share; I have been a LTL but most of my stories are just complaining about ID10T errors. \n\nAs a bit of background, the 3D printer I support uses filament, a strand of plastic wound on a reel that is pulled into the printer by the extruder and then pushed to the hot end where it is melted and deposited to make the part you want. \n\nA user opened a ticket because he was unable to get the filament to move into the printer correctly. The extruder in our printer is a closed-loop system, so if the filament does not move the printer throws errors and shuts off the hot end until the problem is fixed. We tried everything on the books to solve it. I sent him a new extruder, we tested the tube that the filament runs down for blockages, and looked at the hot end. Everything worked perfectly, but the user was still unable to get the filament to move properly. \n\nAfter a weekend of wondering what I could be missing, I got an update from the user. He had disassembled the filament inlet guide path and found the problem. The filament reels are shipped from the factory with a small strip of masking tape on the end of the filament to keep it in place during shipping. Sometimes the end of the filament comes out from under the tape, which is what had happened in this case. The customer didn't see it and the printer pulled the tape into the filament guide path until it jammed the filament in place. We were able to pull the filament out by hand during testing, but as soon as the extruder took over it wasn't quite strong enough to overcome the adhesive on the tape and the printer stopped again. Once the customer removed the tape and put the guide back together the printer performed perfectly.\n\nTL:DR - Sticky stuff makes movement hard.",

        "text": "Currently on hold getting my new payroll login fixed, so why not type up a TFTS post! Apparently someone at another company signed up with this provider decided my social looked so pretty they had to have it for one of their employees.  \n*$Greybeard: ~~old salty guy~~more experienced tech who has earned his grey*  \n\nWe've been having issues with the VM host at a particular client for a while now. It's running a much older version of the OS, and it's one that prior to this none of us had experience in, so that's been a ....learning experience. Typing a command called \"destroy_domain\" is *fun* the first time around. But occasionally one particular guest would go down, and that command would be necessary to bring it back up again.  \nThis time though, as we were bringing it back up, ALL the servers decided to go down. And I couldn't stay connected to the host - it kept connecting, then dropping. So $Greybeard headed onsite while I assisted remotely.  \nComplicating matters was the only other reachable server was a legacy one, with an attitude problem. Something as simple as right-clicking the desktop to copy a file would cause it to crash (as I did, twice. Thank the tech gods it's being replaced shortly)  \nAfter bumbling along with what documentation we could find, we were both somewhat stumped. He was physically in front of the thing and could log in and view the VMs just fine. But one in particular, though it said it was coming up, was completely unreachable remotely. I still couldn't get connected to the host either - entering the exact same credentials as $Greybeard was got me \"Access denied\".  \nTill finally he booted the problem child VM down and I noticed it was still responding to pings...   \nYup, arp -a gave me a different MAC than I was expecting, for both the VM guest and the host. And the main UPS was beeping.  \n\nMy best guess at what happened: the UPS is slowly dying, which is causing the VM to die. But this time, it went hard down for a bit, taking down the main switch. The APs are PoE so they reboot, and the VM host loses network connectivity. The APs go off the subnet of their controller and do some auto-DHCP craziness in *a subnet with no DHCP configured at all*, and in a freak accident assign themselves the addresses of the host and the one guest. And said guest just so happens to be the onsite DHCP server. So when I was trying to connect remotely I was hitting the AP instead, which runs off a different flavor of the same OS so it looked identical from there.  \nI burst out laughing like a madwoman at that point, and over the phone it sounded like $Greybeard's head and the nearby concrete walls had a particularly enthusiastic heart-to-heart.  \n\nThankfully, both the UPS and the VM host are on track to be ~~deconsecrated~~replaced.  \n\nTL;DR  \n*In a ~~world~~scope where no DHCP server has gone before, two ~~buddy cops~~APs decide to strike out on their own.*  \n*But they accidentally impersonate ~~the president~~the PDC and the VM Host! What will they do next?*   \n*HILARITY ENSUES.*  \n*Coming next summer to a dollar-store bin near you.*",

When I use SecureCRT it doesn't work, when I use Procomm it crashes, and when I use Putty it blue screens.\n\nI sit in silence, waiting for the IT dude to work on it.  After a few minutes of struggling.. I chime in.\n\n&gt; Nero: Have you tried another serial adapter?\n\nGetting a straight answer was hard.  This guys vocabulary is, shall we say, challenged.  And he has a propensity to using pronouns to a fault.  It takes some time, but we manage to figure out that when I asked initally about using different serial adapters, he was talking about plugging his USB serial adapter into different serial ports on his machine.\n\nWe provided him with a new USB Serial adapter.  \n\nNow it's important to mention, that this isn't a \"script\" as we usually know it.  It's a router configuration.  The failure he was running in to was that his pasting of the configuration, was outrunning the router it was being applied to.  When that happened the router would just stop responding.\n\n... So the fix was to slow it down.  Sadly Putty has no rate limiting.  ProComm is not something he should have installed, for a few reasons.  So we're left with SecureCRT.  I added the delays to the line and charecter output and it looked to run fine.\n\n&gt; FieldTroll: Hey Nero, this still isn't working.  See the lines in the config, it says it doesn't work.\n\nSo we try changing the timing again.  This time, I watch carefully what's going on.\n\nYes, there were errors.  The router he had sitting on the desk had no copper telephone ports.  The script he was installing has configurations for copper ports.  \n\n&gt; Nero: Are you sure that script is for that router?\n\n&gt; FieldTroll:  Yes!  The guy *over on the other side of the office* could install that script without problem.\n\n&gt; Nero: I'm seeing settings for copper ports, that router doesn't have copper phone line ports.  It's erroring, but because parts of the config don't match that router.\n\n&gt; FieldTroll:  Ok, I'll get another router.\n\n...........  He's not returned with a new router.  I believe I've fixed the problem.  But I also think he's not going to admit it's fixed.  But seriously, if your'e going to have me check your stuff, make sure the stuff you're using is compatible, so when we test it.. and it works.. it actually works.  ",

I wish I would have googled the number for the humane society or something but I was very confused. I felt bad to disappoint her in that the IT help desk is not a place where people can help you solve any problem. I wish I had that super power. \n\n\nEdit: changed “human society” to “humane society” ",

        "text": "Rack space is at a premium.  Due to cooling, floorspace, and power requirements.  Sometimes, this means you need to shuffle things around to make space to allow devices to be clustered properly.  \n\nThis... is not usually a problem.  This.. was a problem.  \n\nIn this case, we want to dedicate a rack to T1 testing gear.  Each testing device sucks up something like 8u, so they're gonna use the whole rack.  All I have in there is 5u of servers, and 2u of \"other stuff\" but it's all gotta get out of there.  \n\nUnder most circumstances this would be a breeze.  Shut the boxes down cleanly, move them, turn them on, and it's like nothing happened.  \"Under most circumstances.\"  The whole shutting down cleanly, means drives get parked, settings get saved.  The machine should come up happily.  \n\nThat is unless it's decade old hardware.  Or if it's not decade old hardware, HP DL380e G8's...  \n\nSo I shut down one server, and move it to it's new home.  I power it on..... then it shuts itself off.  ... weird....  so I do it again.  And it does it.. again.  So out comes the console and I try to get the stupid thing to tell me what it's doing.  \"No system disk..\"  It was just then, that my heart sank.  A half hour of troubleshooting later, I discover that the raid controller (for one drive...) had forgotten it's configuration.  \n\nOk, so I have two of these servers, there's no way the second server is going to do the same thing.  So I went to reboot it, and see how it's raid card was...  Aaaand it's lost it's drive configuration too.  What the ever loving....   \n\nThen I went and consulted the internet.  It turns out that that particular raid card, in that particular model server, just can't remember it's raid card settings.  Ever.  Thankfully, the person who setup these servers just left everything as defaults.  Setting the drive \"as the box suggested\" and setting them bootable got the boxes back up.  I felt really lucky that worked.\n\nThen came the mail server.  A Barracuda 600.  One of those servers with a raid 1 and what should be a pretty bulletproof setup.  I plugged it in, turned the power on... and the front lights never moved to \"ready to go\".  ....  Turns out as soon as it tried to load the kernel, it just locked up.  This story ends in a much more sad place.  It's a mail system, so there's a backup MX.  But... instead of fixing it, we're retiring it.  So long mail filter.....\n\nAmusingly, this night, which stretched out into four hours, was supposed to have been for moving seven devices.  We only moved three.  I get to go back tomorrow night to finish the job.  I am genuinely scared.\n\n-Nero",

        "text": "About an hour before lunch I was sitting in my office like one does. A couple helpdesk calls here and there, but generally pretty calm. I work at a shipyard, so most my jobs are either the normal forgotten passwords, or they're some weird production machine with embedded Windows that broke.\n\nDuring this time I got a quick call from the receptionist one floor below me:\n\n&gt;$receptionist: \"Hi, $me. The plotter in the copy room just prints black on the paper. Could you take a look at it?\"  \n&gt;$me: \"Sure, I'll be there in a moment\"\n\nWhen I arrived a minute later I realized there had been a couple of misunderstandings. Or should I just say \"sparse info\".\n\nThe receptionist didn't mean a plotter. She was talking about the A0 photo-grade printer. (Canon iPF-750)  \nIt didn't print black when you asked it to print something. It was constantly printing black.  \nThere was a giant string of A0 paper, at least 10-15 meters long sprawled onto the floor. With pure black printed on it.\n\nI tried to click cancel. But it didn't stop. It just said \"Finishing current job\" and I could tell that would never end. So I rushed back to my office and logged onto the print server and killed the print job. Then I went back down and pulled the power for the printer, and plugged it back in manually (Had to delete the job first. Otherwise it just retries)\n\nThe printer managed to spew out what was at least another 10-15 meters during the time it took me to get back to my floor and then back down to pull the power. Making for a total of at least over 20-30 meters.\n\nI had noted which user sent the job, so I walked over to their office and had a talk. He was an engineer:\n\n&gt;$me: \"Heya, did you sent a print job to the printer in the copy room not too long ago?\"  \n&gt;$engineer: \"I did, why are you asking?\"  \n&gt;$me: \"Well there was a slight issue, could I see the file you were trying to print?\"  \n&gt;$engineer: \"Sure, it's this CAD drawing\"  \n&gt;$me: \"Ah I see, these seem to be drawings for a ship.\"  \n\nSo I opened the print settings and had a quick look. The problem was pretty obvious.\n\n&gt;$me: \"You see this setting called scale? I'd recommend not leaving that at 1:1. Especially not when 'Fill' is set to Solid Color\"  \n&gt;$engineer: \"S**t.\"\n\n**TL;DR**: Engineer printed CAD drawings for an entire ship (About 70 meters in length I'd assume) with scale set to 1:1 and fill set to Solid Black. Didn't even use the plotter, used the expensive color printer.\n\n**Proof**: [Here](https://twitter.com/Kuwaddo/status/868084915061051393). I sort of regret that I never laid it out and took a picture of the entire print job. But that's too late to sob over now.\n\nEdit: Written on a Monday. I somehow mixed up the plotter and the printer. This was corrected and I now need more coffee.",

A good percentage of them are able to follow the guides and make decent headway, but if it isn't in the guide then they deem it out of scope or just don't pursue the matter far enough.\n\nCase in point, customer P ($P), who had been having no luck networking her wireless printer to her computer with her mobile hotspot device. Customer P was cold transferred to me ($BrBW), understandably upset. She'd been sent FOUR replacements, none of them doing what she needed them to do:\n\n&gt;$P: \"I can get it to print through WiFi direct, and the I already have it assigned a static IP address locally. But when I try to set it up, the computer can't find it!\"\n\n&gt;$BrBW: -already astounded that a customer actually knows how to assign a static IP- \"Have you redone the setup for the printer over a cable to make sure the software is loaded right and all the proper drivers are installed and updated?\"\n\n&gt;$P: \"Yes, four times! Every time I get a new device, I go through the whole setup again.\"\n\nAs she's going through her horror story, I'm refreshing on her equipment, because I can count the number of calls I've had about wireless printing on one hand. That's when I notice something in the security settings on the emulator called \"Privacy Separator\". Check it on the manual. It prevents (you guessed it) intranetwork communication between devices.\n\nDerp.\n\nI have her sign in as admin and, sure as shit, it's enabled. Have her disable it, restart the hotspot, and add the printer without redoing all the ridiculous HP software setup. Boom. Printing a test page in under ten minutes.\n\nTL;DR: We sent four replacement devices because no one bothered to look at the manual and uncheck a box in the damned settings.\n\nEdit 1: Sorting out the dialogue spacing.\n\nEdit 2: Dederpification of duplicate phrases.",

At the time I worked nights at wally world, in electronics, and everyone knew it. So as soon as something went wrong I'd get to go out and try to fix it.\n\nNumber 3 was having a problem with their TV, usually the coax face plate pulled loose from the plaster again or a loose wire on the outlet tripping the breaker (twice), relatively quick fixes. So I grab my kit and head out to find the outlet's fine, the coax isn't in use, instead there's a TV meal table beside the entertainment center with a laptop and...\n\n*an HDMI to DVI-D adapter sticking out of the laptop.\n\n*a DVI-I to VGA adapter... Says right there, DVI-I... uh oh..\n\n*a VGA to S-video adapter... Where did you even get that?\n\nand finally\n\n*an S-video to coax adapter? They still make these??\n\nSo the laptop is trying to send a digital signal to an analog TV, but it's not going through because that DVI-I adapter doesn't have the digital pins and there's no converter box of any kind. It took a few tries before I found the explanation that worked. See TL;DR.\n\n&gt;**TL;DR -** Video adapters are like people, just because they both have mouths that look the same does not mean they speak the same language. You have to double-check. *The laptops HDMI speaks English, the DVI-D also speaks English, but the DVI-I speaks French. Yes they all fit together, but they don't speak the same language.*\n\nAs it turned out another tenant who was moving with his job decided to donate his not-as-old TV a few days later. I went over and set that up *properly* and all was well.",

Here's one that just happened. The twist makes it TFTS-worthy.\n\n**Definitions**  \n$Tool: System that everyone in IT uses, that has security based on Windows Active Directory (AD) groups; You need to be in the Users group to log in to $Tool, but also be in other AD groups that define your privileges with the system. You can guess where this is going.  \n$Me: Me  \n$DA: One of the users, who also has AD Domain Admin rights. A nice guy, very smart and helpful.  \n$AMT: Access Manglement Team who provision access to $Tool by adding users to AD groups, on receipt of approved requests. They've been doing this for years.  \n$Auditor: A security compliance auditor. I get on with him very well, as he asks the right questions, not  \"checklist\" questions. We've done a lot of work together to fix the real security risks. Think /u/lawtechie rather than someone working from a simple checklist.\n\n**Prologue**  \n$Tool has been in use for a while, and we're still expanding its use and capabilities. It's pretty simple to use, but one tech team leader contacts me to say his team are having trouble with it, and could I do a presentation/demo to his team to help them. Hmmm - I know $DA and most of the rest of that team, they're very smart, so there must be a serious issue. OK, I agree to talk to them and set up a meeting. I ask if they have any questions in advance, so I can make sure I address them, and the questions I get back are really basic. Hmmm^2 - These guys should be able to figure this stuff out themselves.\n\n**The Setup**  \nI pull together some presentation materials the night before the meeting. Plus, I check what access the team members have and try to anticipate what they might need. $AMT have added them all to the privilege groups I'd have expected, so that should be fine. But wait - what?! NONE of them are in the Users group, so they can't actually log in to get started. Hmmm^3 - Why didn't they just tell me that?\n\n**The Apology**  \nThe meeting begins. I start by saying what I've found, and apologise to them for the trouble they've had. I'll give them a quick overview of $Tool, then we can use the rest of the scheduled time to sort out their requirements and submit corrected access requests.\n\n**The Fix**  \n    **$DA:**  Hey, I can add the team to the Users group.   \n    **$Me:**  You could, but it should really go through $AMT. Though as the requests for privileged access have already been approved and provisioned (incorrectly), we're just fixing a problem...Yeah, please go ahead.  \n$DA does so, and everyone checks they can log in OK. The presentation/demo is a bit unnecessary at this point, but I run through it quickly. They're appreciative, understand everything I'm saying and ask interesting questions. This is great! I've converted them from enemies to allies, and I'm confident we won't have any more problems. (I have a good track record on this - Everyone I've ever trained becomes a competent convert to my cause).\n\n**The Twist**  \nLater that day, I get a call from $Auditor.  \n    **$Auditor:**  Hi $Me, I found something odd here. A bunch of users were added to the $Tool Users group today, but I can't find any recent approved requests. Has there been a security breach with $Tool?  \n    **$Me:**  Oops. No, $AMT had messed up, so we fixed the problem. ($Me explains the situation)  \n    **$Auditor:**  I see. But I'm supposed to report unapproved changes.  \n    **$Me:**  Yes, you should. But please make it clear that I was the one who asked $DA to fix it.\n\n**TL/DR:** Hmmm^4 I fix someone elses mess and get in trouble for doing so.",

I had been working as an internet tech at this call center for about 6 months at this point when I got a call from an older gent.\n\nThe wife can get online but he can’t. I make sure everything looks good on my side and ask about their set up. Basically, husband and wife have separate computers on opposite side of the room that are connected with Ethernet to the router. \n\nI had him swap ports on the router with the wife’s cable and he still can’t connect. Wife is still online. \n\nSo I tell him flat out, either the Ethernet cord is bad and you need a new one or your computer itself is causing the problem and it is much cheaper to buy a new cord first and see if it works than to pack his computer to a repair shop. \n\nHe went off on me about how he is a retired aerospace engineer and copper never degrades or goes bad so it can’t be the cable and I don’t know what I’m talking about. Thankfully he also hung up on me because I had no idea how to respond to that one. We got a little chuckle in the office about it and went about our day.\n\nThree weeks later, his wife calls. I told her I worked with her husband a while ago and explained everything again. When I explained that everything to her computer is working so it has to be between the router and her husbands computer, she understood. I explained again, an Ethernet cord is cheaper than diagnostics at a computer repair shop. I even looked where she could buy one locally and the rough cost for the length she needed. I think like 14ft if memory serves.\n\nShe called me the next day and thanked me for the help. I like to imagine her husband grumbling about the whole thing while buying the cord just to come home, plug it in, and figure out he could get online. \n\n",

The only part she really needed help with was moving the couch to get at the phone jack and power outlet, but I'm the most tech-literate guy she knows so I was on standby in case there was some other issue. \n\nBut anyway, the driver asked me if I was going anywhere interesting this evening, and when I told him he immediately launched into a spiel against his own Internet provider. Apparently he'd been getting much slower speeds than he was paying for and had called their helpline, and then been asked to remove the front panel from the phone jack so he could plug his hub into the test socket.\n\n\"I'm not doing that!\" he'd exclaimed (or so he told me), in a decidedly affronted tone of voice. \"If I'm going to have to do anything involving a screwdriver you can send someone out to sort it out!\"\n\nI do have some sympathy for him, because I can understand people being a bit wary of taking a screwdriver to an outlet when they've no idea what else might be behind it and how fragile it might be, but I can just imagine his tone and the reaction of whatever poor unfortunate helpdesk minion was on the other end of it.\n\nThe conversation rather dried up after that.",

The second day however wasn't as successful. The line manager in his infinite wisdom decided to join in and help, and started pulling all the old cables out and cutting them. Keep in mind that there was probably 40 cables being fed through a gap in the wall.\n\nThis broke everything, half the line stopped responding to inputs, the other half wasn't showing any data, and the reporting software stopped getting data. Line manager however decided he did nothing wrong, that we broke something, and that we had to fix it else we'd have no line operations in the new year and would cost the company thousands.\n\nThe next 3 days were spent panicking and trying to get everything working again, not really what I planned before Christmas break. Somehow we miraculously fixed it by following out-of-date network diagrams,  figuring out what cables were cut, tracing them through under-floor panels, and bodging up the line in order to at least make it functional again.\n\nI've at least learned that companies are built on bodges, and that I should probably keep my head down once in a while...",

I specialize in computers and smartphones, mostly software related things since we don't carry parts (although if people bring parts, I'm happy to replace them).\n\nEither way, a woman walks in, panicked and nearly in tears. She shows me her laptop and tells me it won't start at all, it just gives her a black screen, and it had all her family photos so she's really afraid she lost them. Usually when we get this kind of issue, it means a fried hard drive or motherboard, in which case there's not much we can do. I mentally brace myself to tell the woman her pictures are lost and she should see if she can have a recovery company look at it as I hook it up to power and start the laptop.\n\nSurprisingly, the manufacturer's logo comes up. Not bad. Next, it goes to a black screen with some text at the top. \"Yes! That's the black screen!\" the woman says.\n\nI have a look at the text. It says:\n\n&gt; Battery replacement recommended. Press enter to continue.\n\nI press enter... and the laptop starts normally. The woman audibly ghasps. \"It's working! Thank you, thank you! You have no idea how much those photos mean to me. My mother passed away recently, and these are years worth of photos.\"\n\nI made a backup of her photos on a USB drive she brought, recommended she get an external harddrive for backups and come back next time to let me help her get it set up, removed the battery (she said she only used it while plugged in) and sent her on her way. \n\nIt's easy to get annoyed with people for not even trying to read error messages and such, but seeing the relief in her eyes (she even teared up a little) made any annoyance melt away. Helping her out definitely made my day, and I still smile whenever I think of that repair.",

We assumed there was an issue with the camp AP for the PtP. Colleague started troubleshooting around 9am. He was walking the person at camp through every possible reason for the outage. Bad cables, dead hardware, looking for lights on PtP units and even pinging the Camp PtP unit (which replied). Got to 3pm and it was looking like one of us was going home to pack a bag and do the 14hr day of travel to get to this site. I was already getting my list of reasons together to argue why I couldn't go.  \n\nColleague asked the client at site to try one last thing with the PtP unit and half way through, client says:  \n\"Quick question, would an aluminium water tanker stop the signal?\"  \n \"YES\" he yelled a little too loudly...  \n \"Please dont tell me that someone has parked the water tanker in front of the PtP Access Point\"\n\n5mins later, network connectivity was restored and I managed to stop laughing.\n\nSo now we have bigger signs and a fenced off area in front of that part of the trailer..

Code has been in a decent shape for quite a while now, to the point where my **$supervisor** can also make minor changes, like if there's something speficic for one or a few of our customers, he doesn't need to make a ticket for me, but he can just make those minor changes himself. Usually that ended up with me having to copy the file changes to my local working copy, and pushing those to source control.  \n\nThat takes up quite a bit of time every now and then though, so somewhere in december I think, I set him up with version control on his laptop, showed him how to pull, commit and push changes. Now just this morning I tried to push my changes but noticed there were some changes I didn't pull in yet. Lo and behold, my supervisor made some minor changes by first pulling my stuff in, then making his changes and commiting them with a proper description of what he did.  \n\nHe's already a good supervisor, but those things just put a smile on my face. When you've got a shitty supervisor, or stupid manglement, don't forget that those people often ended up there because they end up doing less damage in that spot, then they'd do while performing the actual work",

I don't see anything wrong so far, but if you help me narrow down the issue, I would know more specifically where to check for problems.\n\n&gt; Hyde: UGH!\n\n&gt; Me: \\**ignoring the interruption*\\* What exactly is the problem?  You can make calls out since you're talking to me right now, but how about inbound calls?  Do you get those okay?\n\n&gt; Hyde: **YES!!!**\n\n&gt; Me: How about any black screens whenever you call or receive calls?\n\n&gt; Hyde: **NO BLACK SCREENS!!!  NO!**\n\n&gt; Me: Do you have any questions about features, maybe?\n\n&gt; Hyde: OH MY {UNBELIEVABLE} {DEITY}, YOU ARE SO ANNOYING!  **NO!!!**\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, then, uh... it seems like your [device] is working like it should?\n\nThat last sentence came out more of a question than I would have liked, but being incomprehensibly screeched at tends to rattle one's nerves.  Plus, you know, I'm rather baffled as to why she's so furious about an apparently properly-functioning [device].\n\n&gt; Jekyll: Oh, okay.  You checked my [device], then?\n\n&gt; Me: \\**blinks at the abrupt volume change*\\* ... um, yes, I checked your [device], it seems to be fine.  If you have any problems later, please do call us back and we'll... be... happy to help?  \\**utterly confused*\\*\n\n***\n\nThat's the tech support part of the story, if you could even call it tech support.  But the call doesn't end there, oh no.  The real tale is what happens next right before the customer hangs up.\n\n***\n\n&gt; Jekyll: \\**muttering to herself*\\*  So many problems...\n\nAs she readies to hang up, she makes convulsive jerking motions with her head, hand, and arm  and her voice takes on a strange cadence.\n\n&gt; Hyde: **PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS**...\n\n&gt; \\**click*\\*\n\n***\n\nI've met plenty of customers with verbal and/or motor tics but none were so creepy as to set the little hairs on my arms standing straight up like a crabby old lady almost perfectly cloning Gollum's horrible throat-clearing noise and motions.\n\nAfter that call, I still had 15 minutes left in my shift for the day.\n\nThe hell with that.\n\nI clocked out early and went home.",

Tier 2 help-desk technician for a mid-sized company, with a very skeleton crew helpdesk. There were 10 of us total for 24-hour coverage supporting 2500+ company-wide.\n \n$Peers: Random Tier 1 and Tier 2 techs.\n \n$User: Your everyday user, someone from one of the company locations. In this case, one of the older employees.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n$Selben wandered into the office early. He was working on a project and needed the extra hour, but honestly the extra hour of sleep might have been a better choice. He slid in the side door and plopped down at his desk. After powering up his machines, he followed the morning ritual of getting coffee. He had been working on the project for a couple hours when he got some email updates that several T1 techs were running late, so he opted to jump into the call queue. Almost immediately he received a call, with an older sounding user.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling the helpdesk. This is $Selben!\n \n&gt; $User: Eh? Hello?\n \n&gt; $Selben: Yes… Hello, this is $Selben from the helpdesk.\n \n&gt; $User: Is this Fax support?\n \n&gt; $Selben: I can assist you with that!\n \n&gt; $User: Oh good! I can’t get our fax working. (*starts mumbling*)\n \n$Selben muted the user and sighed. They had tried to phase out the fax machines several years ago, but some vendors still required them, so the techs still had to deal with them.\n \n&gt; $Selben: Okay, what seems to be the problem?\n \n&gt; $User: It won’t send!\n \n&gt; $Selben: Okay, do you get a dial tone?\n \n&gt; $User: I don’t hear one.\n \n&gt; $Selben: What do you hear?\n \n&gt; $User: You.\n \n&gt; $Selben: …\n \nThe troubleshooting went back and forth for nearly an hour before $Selben was able to figure out the user had been using the fax as a phone and had called $Selben using it. \n\n$Selben made the realization and called the user back on their desk phone.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Can you hang up the other phone?\n\n&gt; $User: Yeah sure!\n \n&gt; $User: Okay, it’s dialing now!\n \n$Selben could hear the paper scanning.\n \n&gt; $User: It says sent. Thanks so much! Goodbye!\n \n&gt; $Selben: Have a good one, bye!\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n$Selben started filling out the ticket, but paused when he heard the clunks and clicks of the only fax machine in the office spitting out papers on the desk behind him. He slowly turned around and walked up to the fax machine. It was a fax, from the user he had just gotten off the phone with, asking for IT support to aid in getting his email on his new phone.\n \nIn the early years of $BiggerCompany, users would send in faxes to the helpdesk if they were having issues. They were only to call the helpdesk directly for emergencies, and of course to resolve any fax machine issues. No one had bothered to officially remove this policy, since most locations no longer had fax machines at all. An additional policy had evolved over the years to include emailing and calling for non-emergency support. Technically, the user wasn’t wrong…\n \n$Selben called the user back, and helped him set up email on his phone. At the end of the call, he informed the user that the support request process had changed “recently,” and he could just call in next time.",

        "text": "Another story reminded me of this tale.  This happened around 2007ish.  I can't remember exactly the year.  I was a lonely Airman in the USAF and I was tasked with doing tech support for a MAJCOM's technology symposium.  I always liked these because I got tons of free food, got to hang out with big wigs, was given a lot of responsibility, usually got a couple of Lieutenants to boss around (yeah, as an enlisted guy), and all the big names in tech would bring out their best toys.  Right around this time, Lockheed-Martin had a fully functional F-35 cockpit simulator that they brought out to show off - it was cool playing on that after hours when none of the attendees were around.\n\nAnyway, the rest of the story: besides the expo floor, there were also seminars being hosted.  We'd given packets to all of the presenters directing them to contact tech support two weeks before the symposium if they were going to use any of the audio or video equipment, such as a projector, in their seminar room prior to the expo.  We followed this up with a phone call the week before to ALL of the presenters.  Then, the check-in packets directed them to seek the tech school in Rm XX (with map included) if they planned to use any equipment.  Essentially, anything more than a white board they needed to contact us.  On top of ALL OF THAT, we also checked in with each presenter during the break periods between seminars.\n\nSo, in the middle of seminar time, when everything is supposed to be quiet because everyone was in a room getting a presentation, I get a call over the radio that one of the presenters is having trouble with a projector.  I look at the schedule and this presenter hadn't signaled at any of the previously mentioned times that they were going to use a projector.  I dutifully went to the classroom, it was being hosted by some PhD in some field of important study.  I entered, identified myself as tech support, and was ready to get started.\n\nWell, that wasn't their plan.  They had invited be into this room simply to ambush me in front of all of the attendees, because \"the projector doesn't work\" (this room probably had 40-60 people).  I was never given a chance to even look at the equipment.  After he berated me for 2 - 3 minutes, in a room full of Senior NCOs, Majors and above, I was shooed away by him.  He stood there and told me that I was an idiot, that he knew it was the projector and not his computer, and that he didn't have time to let some high school kid (I'm paraphrasing this part but this is what I feel he meant) touch his computer.  I was simply there to be his scapegoat.\n\nTo this day, I have no idea what the problem was.  But I suspect he needed to Fn-F8 (or whatever the key combo was) to get his laptop to mirror the screen and VGA output.  Nothing was ever done about him and I've never seen him again.\n\nDetails are sketchy, this story is 10ish years old.  But that's what I remember.\n\nEdit: # of people in this presentation room at the time",

I remember that guy from the last time he called me - we didn't have a VGA cable long enough to connect his laptop to the beamer. Yeah, that sucks, but usually we use wireless HDMI sticks (what a pain in the ass...) and well, he doesn't have it.  \n  \nAnyway, he chose to answer my question if we could move his laptop like 30cm (1 foot) to the side with a snarky remark along the lines of \"do you think I'd stand here if there was no need to\".  \n  \nSo I offered him one of those magic sleep-spell wands, I mean a wireless presenter, to click through his power point slides. Nah, he also wants to do other stuff on his laptop. Alright mate, beats me, so sorry. We'll maybe order a longer cable specifically for you next time.  \n  \n  \nTime passes.  \n  \n  \nToday I'm on my lunch break, minding ~~my own~~ reddits business when a colleague approaches me. They have some problems getting a beamer running, could I maybe...  \nSure, why not. Usually 99% of those calls only need some cable pushing and Windows-P. Three minutes max, let's go.  \n  \n  \nGuess who's there holding another presentation on fuckifIcare.  \n  \nSo I ask some questions, notice the blinkenlights on our table ports aren't flashing and go into full cable monkey mode, starting to trace everything from the table to the floor.  \n  \nAll the while our external speaker acts just like that and interrupts every single question, every single check with \"nonono, that can't be it\" \"it worked just like that before it didn't anymore\" and similar helpful advice.  \n  \nI'm fed up. He's not a customer, he's not a user, I'm officially not even on the clock right now. And my peanut honey cornflakes are getting soggy as I put up with this bullshit.   \n  \nUnterdosis: \"Okay, just a moment. You called me since you have a problem and asked me to help, right?\"  \nI stare right at him with the look I reserve for doorhandles catching my clothes.

Your choice.\"  \n  \nHe remains silent, good. I've finished checking the cables and have a look at the beamer now. Literally a look.  \n  \nThen I go and fetch the damn remote to turn that damn thing on before going back to my soggy cornflakes. \n  \n",

The moment anyone gets wind that you have even the barest comprehension of how to use any kind of technology, you become the go-to person in every workplace and among your family, friends, and neighbors.  And I honestly don't mind, but I do expect people who are getting my help for free at 9pm to at least listen to what I tell them.  Repeatedly.  Over and over again.\n\nMy mom has had a Kindle Fire for the last 3 years. I still have to put books on it for her and take them off.  She's finally getting the hang of borrowing library books on Overdrive by herself (most of the time), but can't seem to get the hang of returning or deleting them, even with exhaustively written instructions, complete with little illustrations.\n\nI have created many exhaustively written instructions, complete with little illustrations, for my mother.  She ignores them because she \"always gets them wrong\".  She gets them wrong because she always assumes that, no matter how painfully and exquisitely explicit my instructions are, she must be reading them wrong, so she doesn't actually follow the instructions.  The instructions say \"press button A\"?  She will press button B because she's sure she's not understanding the instructions correctly.\n\nYesterday, despite my having shown her several times previously, she asked for my help downloading books from the Project Gutenberg website.  I manage to get her to the website, tap the search bar, the Kindle keyboard pops up at the bottom of the page, she types something in, and then I tell her to tap the \"Go\" button on the keyboard.\n\nSo she tapped the search button (the magnifying glass symbol).\n\n&gt;No, Mom, the Go button.\n\nShe tapped the search button again.\n\n&gt;The Go button, Mom.

Right here.  Where it says Go.\n\n&gt;Mom:  This one?\n\nShe taps the back button, which takes her to another website.  I take the Kindle away from her, go back to Project Gutenberg, type in her search term, and hand it back to her.\n\n&gt;The Go button.  Right here.  See where it says \"Go\"?\n\n&gt;Mom: Are you sure?\n\n*FFFFFFFFF-*\n\nAt this point I'm torn between breaking down in quiet sobs of despair and stuffing the Kindle down my mother's throat.\n\n&gt;Yes, Mom, I'm sure.",

If you like this one you can check out my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/77l9ze/i_just_sent_you_an_email_asking_you_how_i_can_use/?st=jcidedgv&amp;sh=204d2237).\n\nSo, I'm working some combination of tech support/professional services/sales in a small software company of 20 people. I'm responsible for the Japanese market since I speak the language, and because Japan you are bound to at some point work mostly through what they call System Integrators. For those of you who are unfamiliar with them, my cynical TL;DR of what an SI do is charge 30% to forward quotations between the actual software developers and the end user. This particular SI has been our major partner for the last 3 years and while they claim to do support, it wasn't until I told them that \"the end users tell me they see no point in working through you as you have 0 resources allocated for professional services and support\" that they actually dedicated 2 guys to do support so you can probably see where this is going. Anywho!\n\nWe have a joint customer who is...pretty pissy about everything. My first case with them when I started at this company was initialised with him berating us on how shitty our response times and support quality was. When he sent previous mail conversation from our at the time partner it became abundantly clear that this was a stock-response to anyone who took more than 20 minutes to reply to his non-critical issues. \n\nThese guys have an issue with their new environment that's been going on since mid-October when they changed their infrastructure. After the upgrade the end users experience delays in everything they do, like opening a file takes 20 seconds. The end user thinks it is our software and stops the services, and even though the issue persists they believe it is still us who is to blame. Instead of the SI sending the log files like they're supposed to do, they hide the fact that there is an issue at the customer site and claim they want to \"set up a lab environment on their own so they can learn about our software\". It's not until they casually mentions that the customer has \"some latency issues\" that the real problem is described. So, I contact the end user and they tell me the issue which is immediately followed by a mail from our SI saying \"don't mail them directly, please communicate through us\". \n\nBack in the lab environment that the SI set up our software throws error 10061. The communication then proceeds something like the following:\n\n**Us:** 10061, yes, this means that the target machine actively refused the connection. This is very common and in 100% of the previous cases it has been one of the following: username or password is incorrect, port is blocked, user is locked on the storage side, you're communicating on HTTP when it should be HTTPS, or you have a firewall blocking the connection.  \n**Them:**  We have tried all of these. We believe it is the OS version of the NAS.  \n**Us:** Are you sure? Because this error has in every previous case been one of the above.  \n**Them:**  Yes, we have tried everything. I think your lab environment is not using the same OS version as we do, it must be the OS.  \n**Us:** Actually, I have the same version as you mentioned here, can you please verify the above things again?  \n**Them:**  *sends screenshots of every step* yes, look here, we've tried these things.  \n\nThis goes on for about a month and in the process I get lost in the 100's if not 1000's of screenshots they send. So I start discussing with the developers of what the reasons could be and it turns out we've had cases where several entries for the same FQDN of a server points to different subnets in the domain caused this so we start investigating the DNS but it turns out that's not the issue either.\n\n*Maybe this is a genuine problem?*\n\nFast-forward to yesterday when I arrive on-site to look at their lab environment. The firewall they said was disabled is activated without the listening rules for our ports. The HTTPS connection that they said they tried was set to HTTP and the system engineers who said they had tried it didn't even know how to find the setting.\n\nI really should start demanind remote sessions for everything.\n\nEDIT: Some formatting",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7qw8vl/snipe_hunt_20_hours_in_the_network_from_hell/",
        "text": "#0. Introduction\n\nHi TFTS. It's been a while. Like it says on the tin, I'm a mercenary sysadmin. That means I get to inherit other people's problems... regularly. That generally means cleaning up years worth of accumulated cruft and \"mostly working\" band-aids, in order to turn a festering collection of slow-burning dumpster fires into a clean, perfectly-ticking, *profitable* client. Mostly these clients are fairly small - 50 desktops or under - but the occasional bigger environment falls in my lap. This was one of those.\n\n#1. The Snipe Hunt Begins\n\nWe've all had the \"somebody plugged a rogue device into the network\" problem at some point, and this was one of those. It was an unusually nasty one, though. This was a rogue device plugged in somewhere in a several hundred device network on a sprawling multi-building K-8 school campus. A campus with no actual servers, no Active Directory, and completely unmanaged switches. Pardon me, with *nested* completely unmanaged switches, some of which were hidden above the ceilings of random hallways. Yaaayyy.\n\nAs if things weren't bad enough already, the outages were frustratingly inconsistent. Broke stuff wouldn't *stay* broke - it'd be mysteriously broke for a half hour, then just as mysteriously swim back into service. (This was further complicated by frantic staff who would rapidly shuffle between hardwired, wifi, and *guest* wifi connections at semi-random.)\n\nI eventually isolated the problem to \"the new building\", on the other side of a fiber link in the primary MDC, by careful, tedious, and frustrating manual network bisection. At this point, I deployed a brand-new 48-port smart switch in the campus' primary MDC. My smart switch would refuse to pass SYN floods, or rogue DHCP traffic. It also refused to believe that 192.168.1.1 went anywhere stupid, once I'd manually bound the router's IP and MAC address to the correct physical port. This restored reliable service to the campus as a whole, but \"the new building\" was still just as screwed as ever, until I could find the actual problem.\n\n#2. The \"New Building\"\n\nThe \"new building\" wasn't all that old, but it wasn't in any better shape than the rest of the campus. It featured room outlets with conflicting alphanumeric labels on the right and left sides of each jack. Sometimes the right label was correct. Sometimes the left. Sometimes neither one was correct - or there was no label at all. Similarly, the ports on the patch panel in the electrical room were labeled haphazardly. Some marked \"N/U\" - presumably for \"Not Used\" - were patched, and had link lights. Some which were labeled with apparently valid alphanumeric tags did not go to any outlet with a matching tag on either side of the jack. Others weren't labeled at all. But the worst of them was marked with nothing but an ugly, amorphous red blob.\n\nOver the next several hours, I learned to truly *hate* Port Blob. When patched into the switch, Port Blob would not produce a link light, no matter what port it was patched to. You might reasonably think this means there's nothing on the other side of Port Blob. Unfortunately, you'd be just as unreasonably wrong. Once I'd paperclip-reset and gained access to the switch - a not-particularly-\"smart\" Netgear GS724t - I saw that whatever was on the other end of Port Blob was successfully passing traffic, despite the lack of a link light. Yes, really.\n\n#3. Plumbing the Depths of Port Blob\n\nI had deep suspicions about Port Blob, but I couldn't *prove* anything yet. My usual trick - doing an `ipconfig /all` on an affected computer, and looking for incorrect DHCP settings that would lead me back to the rogue - just wasn't panning out. Every device in the building would promptly get DHCP service from my shiny new pfSense router, but half of them couldn't *ping* that router, or anything on the internet, afterward. This led me to suspect I had a TCP problem, but not a UDP problem, since DHCP worked. So maybe a SYN flood? One that somehow made TCP unusable, but without actually bringing the router itself down? That didn't really make sense, because ping (which is ICMP) didn't work either. Then again, ping is the literal last priority traffic on any interface, and an overworked interface will cheerfully drop pings entirely if it's super busy. Ugh.\n\nI looked for unusual amounts of traffic on any given port of my not-terribly-smart switch, and got nowhere useful with that. That GS724t wasn't the brightest kid in its class by a long shot, so I wondered if maybe it just didn't show SYN floods in its statistics. Running a really aggressive `nmap` across it confirmed that it did accumulate stats on weird traffic, though, so not only weren't we looking at a rogue DHCP server, we weren't looking at an old-school malware-related DoS issue either. Crap.\n\n#4. You Can't Find a Layer 2 Problem on Layer 3\n\nI eventually realized that something must be ARP broadcasting itself as 192.168.1.1, but *not* servicing DHCP requests. This meant that when a computer would issue a DHCP request to the school's LAN, it would always get serviced by my pfSense router- but the key here is, DHCP responses come from *the LAN's broadcast address,* not from the router's IP address. So afterwards, since the client machine already had a conflicting MAC address in its own ARP tables, it couldn't reach the same router it had just gotten its own IP address from. Ha! \n\nAfter having this brainstorm, I waited for the next outage report. When one came in, I raced there as fast as I could, and managed to get there before somebody monkeyed with it. One `CMD` and `arp -a 192.168.1.1` later, I was armed with a MAC address which *didn't* belong to my pfSense router - so my suspicions were (finally!) confirmed, and the game was truly afoot.\n\nNext, I did a vendor lookup on the rogue MAC address I'd just harvested. This showed me that it belonged to an AsusTek device. So I went back to my paperclip-hijacked GS724t switch, and went digging in its MAC lookup tables. Bingo, there's my ASUS... on port 13, which did not have a link light, because it was patched to Port Blob. Great. Doing the GS724t's internal cable test routine on Port Blob resulted in \"cable failed\", with no distance result shown, so that didn't help any. Next step: look for any *other* MAC addresses harvested from Port Blob. That scored me two more MACs, one of which belonged to a Ubiquiti device - which meant that I'd found one of the school's access points on the other end of Port Blob. Hallelujah!\n\n#5. Seek. Destroy. Rejoice.\n\nFinally, armed with the MAC address for an AP in the same room as Port Blob's far side, I roamed through the halls with Wifi Analyzer running on my phone. Soon enough, the access point I was looking for popped up on the visible list, and I Marco Polo'd my way into the gym teacher's office. Here I found a loosely nested 50' patch cable spanning the space of three feet from an unmarked outlet on the wall to an old Netgear desktop switch, of the \"blue steel\" 100 Mbps variety. Three other cables were patched into the little Netgear; one ran to the Ubiquiti AP I'd sniffed my way into the office with, another snaked sinisterly into the ceiling by way of a ragged hole thumb-poked into a tile, and the third... ah, the third went to a little white ASUS router. The \"Karate Champ\" music immediately played in my head. **FULL POINT**.\n\nAfter unplugging that damn ASUS router, the (worst) source of (most of) my misery, the next step was unfucking Port Blob. First, I labeled it **gym ofc** on the patch panel, with the tiniest font my labelmaker offered. After that, it was time to isolate the reason it did pass traffic but didn't produce a link light on the GS724t. Going back to the gym teacher's office, I found a visually identical \"blue steel\" switch sitting on the desk, not plugged into anything. And this one was gigabit - score! I plugged it in, re-patched everything from the 100 Mbps blue steel to the gigabit blue steel, and raced back up to the patch panel. AHA! Port Blob now showed a link light - a *gigabit* link light, at that - *and* it passed traffic!\n\n#6. After-Action Report\n\nPiecing the whole thing together later for my after-action report, I discovered that the school's landlord had brought in a security vendor to install a wireless keyfob system. Reconstructing things from there, $vendor tried to connect their gear to the ASUS, which the landlord owned and \"managed\" as a wifi bridge to have \"their own wLAN\", but it wouldn't work reliably. So then $vendor paperclip reset the little ASUS, which both took it out of bridge mode *and* set its LAN IP to 192.168.1.1, same as the school's real network. Shit still didn't work, so at this point $vendor shrugged and plugged their gear into the school's LAN directly... but left the ASUS router they'd been monkeying with plugged in too. This wasn't *quite* where the trouble actually started, though.\n\nHere's where it gets extra crazy - the only wire plugged into the ASUS was in the WAN port, which by itself wasn't enough to cause any trouble. Except that the gym teacher was in the habit of patching her laptop into the network with a cable (sensible) *and* she had a remembered connection to the landlord's WiFi (uh-oh), so *when she was in her office*, her laptop would ARP on its wLAN, find 192.168.1.1 on that damn ASUS router, then respond to ARPs on the school's LAN identifying 192.168.1.1 as present *on its wLAN*. This would make it impossible for a random grab bag of machines across the school campus to find the router, even though they could get a DHCP address from the router just fine. The key here is realizing that DHCP requests and responses occur on the *broadcast* address, *not* on the router's own LAN address - so machines would DHCPREQ on the LAN's broadcast, get a response with 192.168.1.1 as the gateway, but then be unable *to* reach the gateway because of the ARP to the ASUS that they'd seen coming from the gym teacher's laptop.\n\n*And* this whole monstrous mess was plugged into an unlabeled port on the panel, which led to an unmarked outlet in an office, patched to a switch which didn't produce a link light at the MDC but *did* pass traffic.\n\nThe school has promised me they won't let anybody else touch the network from now on. We'll see...",

        "text": "So I work for a banking software vendor and handle two programs for the banks. I will get all sorts of calls, but most are legitimate issues that require assistance, or they don't want to do something themselves. This time though, the client got mad at me because the internet based application does not work without internet. I will me or M and user will be U.\n\nM: Client support this is M how can I help you?\n\nU: Yeah this is User with who cares bank. We have a location without internet, should we take the work to another branch and have them run it again?\n\nM: No, if you take the work to another branch and have them run it again, it will cause the transactions to double post when the internet comes back up at that branch.\n\nU: Ok, what about the file?\n\nM: If your IT can get the network back up, everything will post the way it should. \n\nU: Well this work needs to be run.\n\nM: I understand that, but when their internet comes back up it will cause items to double post, and you will have to clean that up manually. Right now I would recommend speaking with your IT and having them work on the connection problems that branch is having, that should actually be the priority.\n\nU: Ok.\n\nM: Unfortunately there's not much information I can give you, without internet the application just doesn't work. I'm sorry about I'm not able to give you a better solution.\n\nU: Ok, can you have another tech call me please?\n\nM: I can, what is this in regard to?\n\nU: I just need them to call me.\n\nM: Ok, I believe the only other person available just left for an appointment.\n\nU: Ok.\n\nM: I can have someone call you, but it's very helpful if I can give them some information ahead of time so they can be prepared and fix your issue faster.\n\nU: Just the issue we have.\n\nM: Well the priority needs to be restoring internet access to that branch, that will solve all the problems you're having.\n\nU: Ok.\n\n\nSeriously, I don't know what this guy expected from me. I can't fix the software if there's no internet.\n\n",
