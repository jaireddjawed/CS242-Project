It could be from robs perspective too! Since I guess the episode cutting out the way it did meant it was the end of gumball‚Äôs story.\n\nIt‚Äôs worked great for samurai jack and Scooby doo (Velma); which I actually quite enjoyed! It was a lot more interesting with its story telling, humor, relatable characters, and Easter eggs and fourth wall breaks vs the copy paste Scooby doo‚Äôs I couldn‚Äôt give a labor about in the past.\n\nI digress. It should be done in its own way of course, however that may be. Gumball‚Äôs story telling and humor was GOLDEN, but was always a little limited because it was a kids show. (Not that id want vulgarity and traumatic plots for kids) it just has so much more room for possibility! Even though that‚Äôs what made the shot great, I think the audience alway knew there was a bigger lore than the butt jokes and outlandishness. Through a chance like that it could be built upon it! \n\nIdk maybe I‚Äôm just nostalgic or venting. But I would pay a whole new subscription service just to see wherever it streams. I grew up with them and they filled in for a lot of my childhood. It would be incredible to see Gumball and Darwin one more time. (butt jokes and all)\n\nTL;DR \n\nI miss the Amazing World of Gumball and I think a reboot or continuation would be really cool just to see them again.",

        "text": "Growing up in the 80's and 90's, i read a lot of DC comic books (Green Lantern and Green Arrow were my favorite).  As an adult, i wanted to take in the vast universe of characters that the live action TV shows had to offer.  And what i learned is that a LOT of them were not written for adults.\n\nCase in point was the Arrowverse. Every single show in that lineup had varying levels of melodrama, forced conflict where none should exist, and writing that made characters have to make insanely obvious bad decisions in order to progress the plot the way the writers wanted to go.  The characters, whether 22 or 62 all acted like angst-ridden teenagers, always angry at each other over the dumbest things, and no one seemed to understand how adults function.  If i hear, \"You lied to me!\" one more time, i'm going to break my TV.\n\nNow, i'm not saying i want \"dark and gritty.\"  Arrow was dark and gritty, but was not a show for a guy in his 40's.  It's a show for 15 year old girls.  Yet i watched every season of every Arrowverse show because i still wanted to see the obscure characters in live-action that i would probably never otherwise see.\n\nAs a counter example, i did watch Preacher, and that seemed fairly adult.  It was full of drama (not melodrama), and it all seemed earned, and informed by somewhat realistic character motivations.\n\nSo, what other shows can i watch that are not melodramatic shlock, and don't have me yelling at the screen over and over?  What about Gotham?  Krypton? Stargirl? They can be very lighthearted and silly or dark and scary, but they need to be written for adults who can actually follow the logic of storytelling.  Thanks to any help anyone has.",

I was only 10 when this show aired (1994), but I watched it with my parents and it was my introduction to police shows. \n\nThat said, I recently rewatched the series on Peacock, for the first time since airing. I remember some of the key plot lines, but for the life of me I cannot understand some of the decisions.\n\nSeasons 1 and most of 2 were very stylized and unique, with some decent story taking place outsode of the 1 4 precinct. Then, for whatever reason, the tone changed and the show became stale. \n\nThe inclusion McNamara helped bring in a wider audience, but the conclusion of season 3 just baffled me to no end. Behind the scenes politics aside, the killing of two main characters in the same episode never sat right with me. On top of that, the 4th season completely changed the show to the point it may have well been called something else.\n\nExcuse my griping, but I've never talked with anyone who was a fan of this show.",

This is usually when the kids are at work. The dog gets walked, lights get dimmed and cell phones get silenced. Some shows are The Last Of Us, White Lotus, The Great British Baking Show &amp; The Afterparty.\n\nSilver Level = shows that i feel are good but not great. I‚Äôll watch these while people are around and don‚Äôt mind pausing if someone calls. If I‚Äôm home alone I may watch them on an iPad while eating. That‚Äôs shows like Shark Tank, Abbott Elementary, Atlanta, \n\nBronze level = Shows that I couldn‚Äôt get into or just stopped enjoying. These may also be shows I‚Äôve seen a million times. I work from home so I usually have these playing on my phone while working just for background noise. Things like Welcome to Flatch, The Carmichael show (seen a million times but love), lots of stand-up comedy.",

It felt like a horror show at times.\n\nThis show was surprisingly entertaining and had a surprising amount of heart. \n\nThe last episode was so damn good too. The acting too.",

        "text": "We all know the kind of idiot that keeps falling for the same person again and again. \"Maybe this time they won't leave\", they'll say to you as they have the same embarrassing public fights, the same communication problems, and the same messy, heart wrenching breakups. \n\nAfter years of the same endless cycle, today I finally realized: I am that idiot...\n\nI fell in love with the Star Trek-esque misadventures of Final Space and it's beautiful character development, long form plot and compelling villains, only for HBO to cancel it to \"cut costs\". Fool me once. \n\nI was infatuated with the light humor that Close Enough masterfully mixed with the woes of life as a newly independent adult family. It brought joy to my long work days, eased my loneliness from my family beimg 2,000 miles away.¬†I thought I had a friend who knew my struggles, only for them to die in the dumpster fire that is HBO Max. Fool me twice. \n\nI started watching Gravity Falls to discover it's only two seasons long, a concise ending to a series ended before its potential could be wrought. Fool me again and again. \n\nInfinity Train is in unfinished limbo, never to grace the eyes of the fledgling sci fi nerds that came home from school to catch an episode of their favorite day time cartoon. \n\nFuturama fans are being tortured with news of a third (or is it a fourth?) reboot since the first cancelation all those years ago. \n\nLower Decks is... Well actually I am looking forward to the next season, but it's not enough to fill the void in my animated heart! \n\nI don't think I have it in me to connect to another cast of beloved character on a deep &amp; emotional level only for them to be ripped away again and again. How can the joys of laughter outweigh the soul crushing heaviness of these traumatic losses? To watch a loved one be killed without warning or funeral time and again; is this just a personal hell?\n\nSo I'm humbly asking you, fellow cartoonists, to guide me to my cartoony grave. It's been a wild ride; I regret little and learned much - but I need to work on myself. To all the streaming services murdering without consequence: hope you'll fear my ghost as it approaches you on the high seas, haunting a ship as it flies the black flag forevermore. \n\nGoodbye netflix, I won't miss your hit and miss \"quantity over quality\" production choices. \n\nGoodbye Discover, I only ever cared about your Star Trek anyway. \n\nGoodbye Amazon, your mediocrity was only offset by the face and crew of James Holden himself. \n\nAnd goodbye HBO. Your siren song of nostalgic animation won't lure me into your clutches ever again. To think I forgave you after you allowed those two buffoons to destroy a decade of our lives with Game of Thrones? To think I dared blindly trust you again after losing Final Space? Fool me twice, shame on you. And for a third and final time, you've rent my heart into that shape which can not be mended. \n\nI've watched TV for years, but at least Audible has a few completed series. Except for GRRM.
