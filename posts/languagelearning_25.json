I settled on creating a language exchange app because I found that it was very useful when I was learning Mandarin. I'm trying to make it unique from other apps out there (Tandem, Preply, mylanguageexchange, etc) and I would like the community's feedback!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome questions I have are:\n\n1. What are your frustrations with language exchange apps?\n2. Based on these frustrations what would you wish would be in a language exchange app\n3. What brought you to a language exchange app (aside from practice general speaking of the language you are learning)\n4. What do you ultimately hope to gain from language learning (and therefore how does a language exchange app help fit into that goal)\n\nFeel free to dm me if you'd like to learn more about what I'm building",

        "text": "First of all I am Polish. I'm learning English intensively right now, because I believe it is virtually the most useful language to learn. Aside from that I taught myself some latin, and right now I am trying to read some works of the great authors, eg. Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero. Some may think that learning dead languages is a waste of time and energy, but I genuinely feel gratitude towards myself when connecting with authors who lived and created nearly 2000+ years ago. And now I've got some questions about learning classical Hebrew and classical Arabic. I couldn't find anything that resembled thelatinlibrary.com - when I started learning Latin at some point I was afraid there aren't many books to read. Now I know I probably won't run out of reading material for the rest of my life. Are there any websites where I can read Hebrew/Arabic works for free? Are there any works other than religious (Old Testament/Quran), any poems like Aeneid or philosophical ones (like lists from Seneca). How different is classical Hebrew/Arabic from modern Hebrew/Arabic? What are the best (not necessarily free) resources to learn those languages? Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "As many of us on this subreddit already know, the term Romance languages refers to the fact the languages in this family are derived from Latin, the language of the Romans. Some of the languages in this family are frequently described as \"the language of love.\" French, Italian and Spanish are often labelled in such a manner. Does the average person know that the term Romance language has nothing to do with love? Do you think this misunderstanding contributes to the perception of these being beautiful?\n\nIt seems to me that many English-speaking countries romanticize French in particular. In the United States, French is often romanticized in fiction and Paris is seen as a city rich in culture and a trendsetter in the fashion industry. The infamous Emily in Paris series comes to mind. French is also one of, if not the most studied foreign language in the UK. Spanish has also become another language that is popular in English countries and is romanticized like French for the way that it sounds. Is this view exclusive to English-speaking countries or is it a worldwide phenomenon? I understand why many English speakers feel an affinity to Romance languages because much of its vocabulary originates from Latin, but Greek and Sanskrit (among many other languages) have also greatly influenced the English language and are not romanticized to the extent that French is. \n\nThe thing that bothers me with the romanticization of the Romance languages is that it causes some people to hate on languages they perceive as \"rough sounding.\" Languages like Mandarin, German, and Russian are some of the languages that are most commonly derided for sounding harsh. Often times people will hate on these languages without giving them a shot. At the end of the day, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Why does it matter to some learners how a language sounds anyways? I think that romanticizing something too much can also be detrimental. If you romanticize something and it does not meet your expectations, it is likely that you could feel burnt out and disillusioned when reality does not meet your expectations.",

It‚Äôs being taught at what we call a c√©gep in Quebec, it comes before university. In it you learn linguistics, German, Germanic and Hispanic culture and much more. That‚Äôs all good and seems interesting to me but ( this is where the problem comes in ) you also learn Spanish. This is the closest language learning program to where I live, it is the most suitable for me. Going to another c√©gep is not really a good option.\n\nThis would start in about 7 to 8 months, meaning that if I kept going at my Spanish learning at my current pace I could reach a pretty good level. This would make at least a good part of the Spanish courses useless.\n\nHere is the solution I found. I enjoy learning Spanish a lot and don‚Äôt want to drop it, it would be a huge waste of the time I already spent on the language. Therefore I thought I could keep going at it but in a much smaller quantity and start another language ( of course completely different than those mentioned before to avoid mixing them together ).\n\nWhat do you think?",

I take French (a C1-level class) year round, and also work in French. I am thinking of doing a French-language summer program in France this summer. It would be 2 months; 1 month at C1 level (where they prep you also to take the DALF C1), and then the second month at C2.\n\nMy current French level is somewhere between a B2-C1. I don't know if I'd succeed at the C1 right now, but it's somewhere in that range. \n\nDo you think it's feasible to get the DALF C2 this year? Or would it be best to aim for C1 and push C2 to the future. \n\nAlso, if I don't take a French class at university next year (after the summer program), does anyone have tips so that French doesn't die? I'd still be working in French and living in QC, although I wouldn't be hard studying grammar. \n\nPerhaps if someone has had a similar experience or just general advice and you could chime in, that would be great.\n\nThanks!",

However, the more involved I had become in language learning the more grounded in reason I became. I realized that learning a language seriously takes at least 3 years of daily effort and even then I will only barely scratch the level of native fluency. This means that instead of planning to learn 8 languages in the long term, I settled with 2 to 3.\n\nI realized that 99% of polyglots on YouTube are marketers, grifters and at best have a mediocre grasp of the languages they claim to speak. Learning a language could take a lifetime. Okay!\n\nI speak Arabic natively and English as a second language but I am pretty fluent in English that I can blend in any English environment fine, although I am aware that my writing feels monotonous and robotic and I don't know how to fix that.\n\nAnyway, right now I am certain that the two languages that I want to speak are French and Spanish. The third is uncertain. I will make the decision once I succeed in learning Spanish and French.\n\nRight now, I am yo yoing between Spanish and French, not knowing which one to stick with. I like Spanish, but honestly I like French more. I enjoy French music more than Spanish music, and I need French more than I need Spanish in my life, because Algerians speak French and their Arabic is unintelligible to me.\n\nI've been told to NEVER learn two languages at the same time. I thought I'd learn Spanish and French together but that's a very bad idea per the advice of a dozen people I asked.\n\nThe problem is, Spanish is 100 times easier for me because its pronunciation is straight forward. Conversely, French's pronunciation is perplexing. However, I like French more.\n\nDeep inside I want to start with French and only move on to Spanish after 2-3 years.   \nHow to stick with my decision? What is your advice for a first time language learner? I don't count English as a language I have \"learned\" as I passively acquired it from the Internet.\n\nThank you! :)",

        "text": "I think every learner knows Language Reactor (formerly Language Learning with Netflix). I'm not sure if this info is really new to everyone, but it took me some time to research. Still, I thought this info might be useful to some. \n\nMany have asked on the internet if you can use LR on mobile devices. The answer is yes! And that is with the Orion Browser, which you can download from the AppStore. Here you can download the Chrome plugin for LR directly in the app, then activate \"Always request Desktop Website\" in the options and that's it. Go to the Netflix website and enjoy dual subtitles. I use this variant on an iPad Pro M1, so I can not speak for other devices. It works fantastic.",
