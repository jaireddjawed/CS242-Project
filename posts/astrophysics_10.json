If this is true and we take an average expansion rate of the universe and apply it across every aspect of the visible universe would we not have void spaces with lower levels of gravity that are expanding much faster like cosmic balloons constantly pushing galaxy clusters together like tight knit strings if matter and energy? Also would this also explain why it appears as if from our standpoint inside of a cosmic void ourselves that these galaxies are travelling away from each other in all directions? What if being located inside a cosmic void is skewing our perception of the expansion of the universe due to our low level of gravity effecting space/time expansion rates in relation to clusters of highly dense regions in space with lower gravity and therefore lower space/time expansion rates?",

My dream would be to get a phd in astrophysics, however doing some reading on the internet I'm getting the impression that the main path towards doing any kind of research is to complete a postdoc and become a professor. Is this true?\n     For one, I hear that your chances of becoming a professor at a university is very slim. And that phd holders end up wasting thousands of dollars just to move out of their field of expertise. Also, I can't really see myself becoming a professor. I am generally a quiet guy who is kind of nervous at the thought of speaking in front of up to a hundred students. So, is there a different pathway to find a decent job in this field, like at a museum or the government or private sector? I don't care too much about the money I'll make and only want to end up being happy by doing what I love. Thanks!!!",

Do most graduates end up becoming professors (which I don't really want to become) or engineers? My main goal would be to get into a research position at a university(if that's even possible) or work in the private sector. Working for NASA or SpaceX(for a lack of a better example) would be great. Thanks!!!",

I don't need to know the actual velocity of the body or the angle of momentum at an arbitrary point, but if they're something I get as freebies as part of this calculation that wouldn't be too bad.\n\n[Help me /r/astrophysics, you're my only hope!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFJLMyUwrg)",

        "text": "Let me just say, when I came to this sub, I was looking for a place to find respectable, interesting information and discussion related to astrophysics.  After all, /r/astronomy is pretty cool, but not what I am looking for.  /r/space used to be cool, but is just now full of edgy pictures of the moon or something stupid.  Did I come here expecting Girls with Guns?  No.  Did I come here expecting to see Neil deGrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan toasting some '46 (or was it the '47)? No... well, maybe a little.  Did I come here expecting to see Guilty Crown?  No.  \n\nBut most of all, I did not come here expecting to see Him, Isaac Freaking Arthur, the Man himself.\n\nLet me tell you a little back story, just to put it all into perspective.  One night, home alone and with nothing to watch, I started to peruse the YouTubes.  As you all know, late nights are great for contemplating existential thoughts and watching Madoka hunt witches.  So I look up something or another about black holes on YouTubes, and I find some video that catches my eye, \"Civilizations at the End of Time: Black Hole Farming.\" I mean what a perfectly captivating title... civilizations at the end of time?  Sounds pretty existential to me.  Black holes?  Well those things are pretty cool.  Black hole *farming*? I mean come on now, if this isn't going to be some kind of awesome futuristic shit then my name is Gilbert Gottfried.  \n\nSo I click the video, and to my despair, the video is half an hour long, is narrated by Elmer Fudd, contains a table of contents, and has the narrator asking you to watch previous videos first.  I mean what a tool!  This is video is going to be such duesy, right?  Tonight sucks!\n\nBut boy was I wrong.  By shear luck I chanced upon one of the greatest video series of all time.  \n\nThe thoughts this man has are extraordinarly out of this world.  This guy has to be one of the most intelligent board of elections administrators who has ever lived... I mean what is he even doing there?  I guess Albert Einstein worked in a patent office... now this physicist is just waiting for his time to shine, and that time is coming nearer every day.  In my opinion, this guy is going to be the next Ray Kurzweil, if not better.  His YouTube viewership used to be in the lower thousands, but in the last few months alone it has started to take off.  Come on, people, invite this guy to talk at events and stuff!  Come on, Isaac, write a book or something!  This is going to happen, this man is going to be one of the greatest science and futurism communicators of our times, and with his rhoticism, an inspiration to those who have fears of public speaking.  It's going to happen and you're witnessing it right now.  I mean the fact that a moderator on /r/astrophysics recognized him enough to put him on here is proof that he is rising in popularity.  \n\nAnyways, I was just happy to see him in the corner of this subreddit.  Who put him there, anyways?  /u/UNIVERSEnema, /u/Rimm, /u/jaur, /u/perciousangle, /u/nootpoint, /u/astromaddie, /u/Orphillius, /u/Proctor_J_Semhouse, /u/TheEmbernova, /u/riff_satan, /u/drythroat?  I just want to let whichever one of you put him up there, good choice.  ",

The smaller developing nations know that this will put them even further behind and keep them essentially enslaved, so a terrorist group comprised of members of these impoverished nations hijack and ransom the new ship for negotiation. Their demand is that all nations receive an even share of future discoveries. In the end, they succeed.\n\nHow does /r/astrophysics feel about this? Should the more powerful nations keep the weaker ones out of space to keep all its resources to themselves? Or should space be shared by all of humanity and nationalized to be more evenly distributed? Let us know in the comments below.",

For a while I've wanted to study Anime and specialize in Moeshit, but after I looked into it a bit and asked around, I realized a lot of people say there aren't many job prospects and doing an engineering degree would be a much better option. Could someone who's doing or has finished a degree in Anime give me some info on possible career paths, average salaries etc.?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

It was like pulling teeth just trying to get anyone interested in being mods, and the people who did finally volunteer just dragged their feet and never got anything done. It's been months now, and your worthless new mods couldn't accomplish so much as a simple sidebar. Come on, you idiots, this shit isn't rocket science (no pun intended)!! This whole experience has just proven that we were right about you people all along. You're just a bunch of whiny babies who like to complain when things don't go your way, but when it comes to actually getting anything done, you're all completely useless.\n\nSo we're taking the sub back. I'm really sorry it had to be this way, but we've realized that we simply cannot entrust that kind of power to such weak and ineffectual fools. The free ride is over, folks. This sub will be returned to its past glory, whether you like it or not. Dissent will not be tolerated.\n\nPeace, love, and God bless.\n\nSincerely,\n\nthe /r/astrophysics team",
