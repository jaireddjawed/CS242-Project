And because i am a very smart person, i sudo make installed them.\n\nAs i gave them root privileges, i dont know what the heck they are doing to my system. Are they malware? Could they be exploited easily? Can they enroll MOK keys or sign rootkits...\n\nNow this pc is so valuable for me. Building the toolchains and environments would likely cost me another 1 year more and its just so much work.\n\nWhat should i do? Please help me.",

        "text": "I know some Linux types scoff at user friendlieness, but plenty of us don't, let me get that out of the way.  Anyway, I've been looking at the immutable distros out there because later Win10 and WIn11 are disgusting me so much I want to get my less technical family off of them. Problem is, I'm not sure there's a terribly good landing spot. I figure if I give them something immutable it'll be a lot harder for them to break, right? Especially clicking on pop-ups, you know how it goes. \n\nObviously the big one out there is Fedora Silverblue...two problems with it though. One, it's GNOME, which isn't all that Windows-like. I like it personally but it might be harder for someone coming from Windows, learning-curve wise, and the idea is to NOT frustrate people back over to Windows. Kinoite might work out better, but then we get to the second problem: Fedora is religious about offering free software only. So certain codecs and such are missing. That won't do.\n\nVanillaOS is up and coming and seems more relaxed...but again, GNOME. \n\nI'd like to see a more relaxed option out there that uses KDE, or maybe Cinnamon, and I'm wondering why none have popped up yet. I do think if Linux desktops are going to get anywhere it's going to be a situation where you give them a read-only system and let them use Flatpaks. Of course, if nothing's out there I might just have to give them an Endeavour or Mint setup without sudo access, but then they wouldn't be able to update the system, so that's not really a fix. \n\nThis has been turning around in my head for a while and I just wanted to put it out there.  I think there's room for more (and more diverse) immutable offerings out there.",

WSLg is a thing now and literally any GUI app works (I've played around with KDE and GNOME).\n\nI just don't do much with Linux other than use command line tools that are easier to `apt install` in Linux than download from a website in Windows, verify with GNU Privacy Guard, install, add to path, etc.\n\nPretty much the only GUI app I use is Nautilus to easily browse the file system, but I can also browse the WSL file system from Windows File Explorer too. So what am I missing out on? What GUI apps does Linux have that Windows doesn't have an equivalent for (i.e. Davinci Resolve doesn't count)?",

Windows 10 is slated to end support in 2025. I find it unlikely that every Windows 10 user will make the switch to Windows 11 (especially in such a short time) for the following reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Windows 11 doesn't improve on Windows 10 in a way that adds value to the operating system\n* System requirements for Windows 11 are unreasonable\n   * Many computers manufactured from the early to mid 2010s and onwards are powerful enough to complete decent workloads long into the future.\n   * For example, I bought my (high-end at the time) laptop back in 2018 and I can still play all the games I've ever wanted to play.\n   * I find it unreasonable that a lot of people who are currently happy with their computers would choose to spend a significant amount of money upgrading their rigs just to run Windows 11.\n* The Business World\n   * Many businesses that switched to Windows 10 nearly a decade ago will have to upgrade their hardware in order to run Windows 11.\n   * To some, this will be considered an unnecessary business expense. There is already a clear trend in business to shift some operations from Windows to Linux.\n* The rise of the Steam Deck\n   * The Steam Deck has already convinced some gamers that Linux gaming is viable.\n   * Gamers who meet the demographic of the second bullet point will feel pressure to switch to Linux once support for Windows 10 ends.\n\nWhat are ya'lls thoughts on this? Do you think I'm reading too much into this or do you think Linux might have a breakthrough in market share sometime in the near future?",

        "text": "Hi.  I'm going to do nothing else and study Linux for 3 months. I'm not  completely zero in Linux. I used Ubuntu for a year and been using i3 and  Arch BTW for 3 years. I have some general knowledge and I am  comfortable working with configurations and debugging (with a lot of  searching in the internet). But my plan is to become COMPETENT in Linux.  So my step by step plan is this:\n\n1. Studying LPIC 101 and 102 PDFs from LPI website itself.\n2. Studying *LPIC-2 Study Guide Second Edition by Christine Bresnahan and Richard Blum (SYBEX)*.\n3. Installing and configuring Arch, Gentoo, then LFS.\n4. Since  I want to learn Awesome WM and I want to be able to write widgets and  configurations for it, I also will read Awesome documentation and study *Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition, Roberto Ierusalimschy*\n\nAnd besides these, I'm also going to learn Emacs so:\n\n1. Emacs tutorial (I've already studied it)\n2. *Mastering Emacs by Mickey Petersen*\n3. Studying *Learning GNU Emacs, Debra Cameron and others, O'REILLY*\n4. Learn some Elisp by reading *An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp, Robert J. Chassell*\n\nMy  goal is to build and configure a workspace which I'm comfortable with  and I can be productive. Right now in Arch, when updates break the  system, I have to search and search to find the solution to fixing the  system (which I almost always have succeeded in) but that takes a lot of  time and I want to be able to fix my system faster in these situations.  I will probably install Gentoo (or maybe Arch people say compiling  programs take a lot of time, but I'll see myself :)) with Awesome and  also configuring a development environment for myself (for C++, and AI  in Python).\n\nI'm also reading *CompTIA Network+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, 8th Edition, Mike Meyers*  (I have studied half of it till now). I would also need some networking  besides Linux cause my country puts a pretty heavy censorship on the  internet and I have to configure a VPN server for myself.\n\nSo  for all this, I have 3-4 months and I'm free almost all day. Do you  think it's a good roadmap? Would you recommend other resources, another  way to take, etc...? I will appreciate your thoughts and comments.  Thanks.\n\nTLDR: I have 3-4 months to  study Linux. I'm not new to Linux and I have used it for 4 years but  I'm not comfortable with debugging the problems that come up. Which  resources would you recommend to me for studying? What roadmap do you  think is good?",

        "text": "In Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.. you have dependency management solutions.\n\nThe idea is every project wraps its output into an artefact, this is pushed into a central repository (Maven Central, NPM Registry, Ruby Gems, etc..).\n\nThe build management system can extract the artifact contents and link against the contents. To compile your application.\n\nI figure the only technical objection is about C/C++ being platform specific and the artefacts it can produce. However:\n\n* Apache Maven is aware of the operating system and architecture for those terrible Java developers who make OS specific code. \n* NPM and PiP both have dependencies with C libraries (SSL is an obvious one) and are OS aware.\n\nI figure C devs might complain their project in what it produces. At this I would refer to Node.JS developers who produce all sorts of madness and the artefact is still usable accross projects.\n\nThis approach happened years after apt and rpm were developed, but more than a decade before Snaps &amp; Flatpak which aim to overcome how painful it is to use deb/rpm.\n\nMy issue with Snaps and Flatpak is to reduce image size you can now reference  libraries which install as snaps/flatpaks. Which is an incredibly heavyweight means of pulling down libraries.\n\nLastly having written RPM/Deb specs for Java, Node.JS and Python projects its actually really easy to pull the dependency management and build information to auto populate most of it for you.\n\nIt just boggles me the open source movement has spent so much energy not doing the obvious thing.",
