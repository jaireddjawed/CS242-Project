The cross appears numerous times throughout the film, the best part about it being, it can mean what you want it to mean. A crossroads? Conflict represented by the shapes’ perpendicularity? Or quite literally a crucifixion? The meticulous and particular lighting has no right being as well done as it is, and I believe the luscious, rainy, beached Irish countryscape speaks for itself. The dialogue is so perfectly done, every word weighted to its own effect. Each character so simple yet insightful. A fantastic work of art from any standpoint.",

        "text": "one of my favorite documentaries, a close second to Hiroshi Teshigahra’s *Antonio Gaudí*, is Stan Brakhage’s *The Act of Seeing with one’s own eyes*. i have seen it eight times—far surpassing the number of viewings i’ve dedicated to any other film. on the most surface level it’s a half hour film of actual autopsies but that description undermines it. since many shy away from it because they dismiss it as a simple \"disturbing\" movie, i will dispel that myth of provocation and explain why i love it. \n\n*The Act of Seeing* is part of a trilogy of documents (rather than documentaries; see below) shot in Pittsburgh with the assistance of curator Sally Dixon and photographer Michael Chikiris, the latter of whom can be seen in a few shots of *The Act of Seeing*. the trilogy is an stylistic outlier in Brakhage’s filmography known for its abstract editing. in this trilogy he chooses to let his handheld camera simply watch its subjects. *The Act of Seeing* is mostly arranged in the order that it was shot in. this in-camera editing gives the film a naturalistic effect that prevents unnecessarily adding shock to the already graphic imagery. the choice also marks a moment where Brakhage forgoes his authorial power to manipulate the footage towards a constructed meaning.\n\n*The Act of Seeing* is usually regarded as a reflection on death. there is merit to this as Brakhage has stated the process of making the film gave him peace in the idea of eventually dying. personally i enjoy it as being a series of observations on the human body. an equal amount of attention is given to the corpses as to the coroners themselves. similar to Robert Bresson's fascination with the movements of hands, there is a lot of subtle action for a film seemingly about the dead. Brakhage points his camera towards the small details of the corpses, the coroners, and the morgue as a place. this appreciation of small instances of beauty is amazing.\n\nbefore my first viewing of *The Act in Seeing* i spent nearly a month contemplating whether i should even watch it. i was scared that i wouldn't be able to handle it. if you're interested in the film but similarly skeptical, i highly recommend just going in. as someone who hates gore, i did not find this movie scarring. Brakhage has remarked that the coroners were gentle with him because he was frightened of shooting the film. that gentleness is reflected in the film's structure that eases the viewer into the more graphic imagery. until my most recent viewing when i was looking out for it, i did not notice the smooth transition from bare naked bodies on tables to dissection. \n\n*The Act of Seeing* is one of the most unique films i've seen yet. i hope to find (and even make) more films with such an observational patience and appreciation of detail. it's a shame that *Deus Ex* only exists online in low quality and *eyes* doesn't exist online at all.\n\nsuggestions for further reading:\n\n* \"Encounters With The Real: Historicizing Stan Brakhage’s *The Act of Seeing With One’s Own Eyes*\" by Juan Carlos Kase\n* \"The Document Correspondence of Stan Brakhage\" by Marie Nesthus\n* \"Brakhage Salon 5.26.96\" on Phil Solomon’s Vimeo\n\nsome relevant letter excerpts from \"The Document Correspondence of Stan Brakhage\":\n\n* I am most concerned in my work at the moment with Document (as distinct, as I can make it, from Documentary . . . knocking that \"ary\" off the end giving me the sense I am escaping that rhetoric and outright propaganda associated with \"Old Doc\" school of filmmaking . . . that I would rescue \"ment\" for some end in absolute . . . hoping to get the Latin's documentum sense of \"example\" in the first place . . . where documentary's \"lesson\" now sits). My photography of late has led me to a gathering of images (rather than editing) which refers to its Source (say Policemen, Hospital Corridors, etc., as in \"eyes\" and \"Deus Ex\") rather than reflect that Source; that is, the images and the order/rhythms/tones of their \"gathering\" tend to make all reference terminate in the film, thus bouncing energy back only on The Viewer, his Policemen, Men, etc., his Hospital Corridors, hallways, alleys, tubes, what-have-him. I'm coming to believe that, along this line of recent work, I've stumbled upon a way to plug yet another energy leak in Art. A concealed art and a lack of obvious self-expression are essential along this tack. \\[November 22, 1971\\]. *to Hollis Frampton*\n* If I'd had that roadmap (and could've understood it) ten years ago, I'd have known where I was going directly these last six years; and \"eyes\" would have been no surprise to me at all, nor why I whittled my editing responsibilities down to Tone and Rhythm, as most clearly seen in \"Deus Ex.\" But the present case (the morgue footage) pushes me to a further extreme; for single shots (of the morgue footage) carry shifts in specks of tone and rhythm which \"Deus Ex\" took dozens of shots to more obviously accomplish; whereas \"eyes\" ran more along its several lines of various stories, with its rhymes of colors often forced, as in verse, its rhythms sprung by the \"action\" it was following. \"Get the action,\" like they say . . . \"shoot first and ask questions later,\" as you put it; but that's just it, that I have no questions apropo the morgue footage . . . no \"story\" . . . or linear presents itself, as the title I've given the work-in-progress makes clear: \"The Act of Seeing with one's own eyes.\" \\[November 24, 1971\\]. *to Ed Dorn*\n* \"Document,\" I said, taking two steps at a time. The start is always seeming to be \"out there,\" as you put it. Of course it isn't; but the point is it pretends to be. I did recently get this quote from D. W. Griffith: \"What I really want to do is make you see.\" I'm paraphrasing; but that's the gist of it. The trouble with it is the word \"make\", dramatist's inevitable downfall. \\[January 7, 1972\\]. *to Robert Creeley*",

The obsession goes so far as to put the girl onto a pedestal, so far that it gets nearly impossible to ever achieve and \"conquer\" that girl.\nIn most cases everything in the mind results into the dude acting against his own self interest.\nThe mind games and fantasy go so far of reality that just as the end of the film, it gets impossible to reach the woman.\n\nI know this seems like a schizo stream of conscious, ideas and what have he.\nFeel free to expand, dissolve, criticize and whatsoever.\n\nOne thing is for sure, this film is made for a rewatch",

I suspect none of my top 25 films would sway from the vast majority of “top 25 films of all time” lists with maybe 1 or two exceptions. I do my best to not discuss film with anyone who doesn’t like to, and do have great conversations about films with like minded and different minded people. But especially people in their 30s (those close to my age) seem very quick to pull the reverse card when you say “X is done well, as Y as the best example”. They don’t dispute X is done well and they don’t dispute Y film is a good example, they simply dispute that a film can be good, or bad, or even defined at all. \n\nWith that said, it seems to be more and more meaningless to have discussions about things like “the language of cinema” in an era that is very quick to deconstruct what that even means. Some examples of this are things like saying a film “mismanaged it’s tension by leading to a relief moment that took all of the impact out of a scene because it was instantly followed by everything being okay.” \n\nIn a time where everyone can now make films, appreciate films and can at least critique films in a public forum, and thusly redefine, and deconstruct what cinema, film, movies, flicks etc are however they want, it begs the question why discuss what a film does well or poorly at all?\n\nI recognize this has always been true, but I do feel there is a shift in culture with box office numbers being widely known (allowing anyone to define a poor film as a great film by sheer numbers), RT scores reflecting a mismatch of paid, unpaid, hype people and trolls, and a swath of revisionist directors looking to rebrand what a film even means furthering a narrative that “what movies are” is somehow too constricting and critiquing a film using any precedent of other films is a waste of time.   \n\nI’m coming off one of these talks recently, the answer may be “stop talking to noobs about film” or “chill dude who cares”. Tell me if so, but I think there is an actual thought worth talking about here.\n\nTLDR: revisionism and ambiguity of expectation in cinema seems to have created a grey zone for critical discussion. Are people that simply say, a film can be anything man, right? And if so, why think or talk about film as anything other than a personal artistic venture. Am I getting old?",

There was a very similar blend of 2D and 3D techniques to *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*, but instead of that comic book aesthetic, *The Last Wish* looks like a painting from a book of fairy tales has literally lifted off the page and started moving.\n\nOn the flipside, aside from the difference in shading style, the actual animation techniques were very, *very* similar to *Spider-Verse*. It does the exact same trick where it animates faster, agile characters on 1s and slower, lumbering characters on 2s or 3s. It has the characters and sets as 3D models visually flattened by shaders, with effects like clouds of smoke done in 2D. Characters stretch and distort expressively in action scenes like in 2D animation.\n\nIt's derivative, but it's executed well and I like it a fair bit! This new 2D-3D hybrid animation style feels as close as DreamWorks has gotten to their old 2D classics like *The Prince of Egypt*, *The Road to El Dorado*, and *Sinbad*.\n\nDo you think the animation in *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish* was too derivative of *Spider-Verse*? Do you think that Western animated films are becoming too derivative as an industry of *Spider-Verse's* style?",

        "text": "This article includes a lot of film stills. If you would like to see the illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/michael-findlays-shriek-of-the-mutilated/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/michael-findlays-shriek-of-the-mutilated/)\n\nThe 1974 film *Shriek Of The Mutilated* begins with a series of drawings that document the existence of a Yeti, or at least a high school stoner’s doodles of something hairy. As we peruse the renderings, a disembodied voice explains the frightening facts about the Yeti and how it most certainly exists!\n\nIt’s all part of a grand conspiracy I have discovered! Somewhere in a secret, smoke-filled room, there is a cabal that monitors every film that is released about Bigfoot, Yetis, abominable snowmen, and any movie that requires a gorilla suit. They make sure that all such films open with a sober-sounding scientist explaining that these creatures are real. I’ve seen an awful lot of these movies, including Sasquatch porn, and they all begin with a serious forewarning that the events depicted are either real or “could be” real. Maybe it’s a hoax funded by the Gorilla Suit Manufacturers of America, or GSMA. I’m not sure but, now that I revealed their existence, I expect I may be disappeared. If I suddenly go silent, call Q-Anon right away. Maybe he can get John Kennedy or Hugo Chavez to do something.\n\nIt turns out that the narrating voice in *Shriek Of The Mutilated* is Professor Prell, who is preparing his class for a little field trip. They are going to an island where the fabled Yeti lives. No sooner do they arrive and settle in than the Yeti starts popping out from behind trees and rocks, slashing up unsuspecting students who have wandered away from the herd. The Yeti is played by a man dressed up in a shaggy suit that looks less like a Yeti and more like a poodle or maybe shitzu. You could call it a \"yoodle\", or even better a \"shitti\". Whatever it is, it's more cute than scary.  Whilst on the island, the professor and the students stay at the home of the creepy Dr. Werner. There is a lot of standing around in his living room with everyone delivering stilted dialogue. Once the murders start, the students get panicky and ask to go home. One student named Karen, who seems particularly frightened, decides this would be a good time to go wandering around the backyard. Suddenly, she is surprised by a half-naked man swinging an axe. She screams and goes to run, but Dr. Werner appears and asks,\n\nDr. Werner: “Is something wrong?”\n\nKaren: “There’s a man with an axe!”\n\nDr. Werner: “My Indian?”\n\nKaren: “I guess so.”\n\nDr. Werner: “Don’t be frightened, that's Laughing Crow, my housekeeper. I asked him to chop a few logs for us. See? He’s a harmless old buzzard. He takes very good care of me.”\n\nBy the sounds of things and the looks of Laughing Crow’s hairy muscled body, it seems likely that being “Dr. Werners Indian” involves some special duties.\n\nOn the outside chance that you read this article and actually decide to watch this film, I will not reveal the big twist in the third act. Suffice to say, *Shriek Of The Mutilated* transforms from one kind of cheap horror genre to a different kind of cheap horror genre. Either way, the murder and mayhem continue until half the cast is dead, and the movie ends.\n\n*Shriek Of The Mutilated* is tame for a grindhouse film. There is no nudity, not much blood, or at least not much believable blood, and it certainly isn’t scary. An initiated grindhouse aficionado would have expected quite a bit more from director Michael Findlay. Findlay made his name by bringing together the two staples of the grindhouse world: sex and violence. Before Findlay, these two taboos were kept somewhat segregated in mutually exclusive films. You could go see a nudie picture or you could go see a gory picture, but they were rarely combined.\n\nBefore making *Shriek Of The Mutilated* in 1974*,* Findlay had already established himself as a pretty successful New York City underground filmmaker. He had written and directed a successful and nasty little trilogy, *The Touch of Her Flesh* (1967), *The Curse of Her Flesh* (1968), and *The Kiss of Her Flesh* (1968). They were all much more graphic and gory than *Shriek Of The Mutilated.* \n\n*Shriek Of The Mutilated* doesn’t have a whole lot to offer. The soundtrack does feature both Wagner and *Popcorn* by Hot Butter, a rare combination. I wonder what Wagner would have produced if he'd had access to a Moog. I wonder what he would have produced if he'd had access to a film crew. Probably some kind of antisemitic *Lord of The Rings*, only four times as long.\n\nGandalfberg: “Aha! I found you Saromanstein!”\n\nSaromanstein: “Eh, big deal, for this you want a medal?”\n\nGandalfberg: “Oy! Always wit the wisecracks! A little respect might be nice. I’m gonna turn you into a pastrami sandwich!”\n\nSaromanstein: “Enough wit the magic already! And I prefer corned beef wit the mustard on the side, gives me heartburn.”\n\nGandalfberg: “Oooh such a heartburn I’ll give you!”\n\nSaromanstein: \"Heartburn Schmartburn, I’ve had acid reflux since I was little, my doctor tells me I should try to relax, but with the wife always complaining, and the rent on the black tower is going up, what do I know from relax?”\n\nGandalfberg: “Oy, tell me about it. You want maybe we should share a little nosh and some tea?” ",

More just ones that tap into the anxieties and hopes of Western society at that time. I especially like old sci-fi and horror like Star Trek, Village of the Damned, and the old Twilight Zone.\n\nMy favorite movie of all time is Wings of Desire and my favorite album is Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, both of which fit the criteria I’m looking for, if that helps. I’ve also seen and enjoyed Doctor Strangelove and The Iron Giant.",

Bresson famously denied that his movies contain symbolism (white pigeons flying away at the end of The trial of Joan of Arc was interpreted by many to have a deeper significance but Bresson simply stated that usually there are many pigeons at large public events) but maybe this was an exception considering it's his latest movie so he felt comfortable experimenting with his style?",

        "text": "In December 2022, two different animated features were released on streaming services following muted theatrical runs. One of these was an adaptation of a 140-year old story, the third notable film adaptation released in 2022 alone, and roughly the 30th known version of the story since the 1940's. The other was an original film with all-new characters, released by the biggest name in animation of all-time. Knowing these facts, one would expect to like the latter film more than the former, because it has more resources being put into an original idea, and as movie fans we keep saying that studios should be making more original movies of instead of endless remakes and sequels.\n\nHowever, in actuality, it was the former film that became more beloved, and was praised for being riskier and more inventive with its story and characters, while the latter was criticized for a predictable plot and one-note characters we've seen countless times before, and promptly got forgotten to the ether of time. These movies, of course, are Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio and Disney Animation's Strange World. The main reason why one was more successful than the other was that one was made by an auteur with an undying love of film and animation, while the other was made by a soulless corporation that only sees animation as kids' stuff and cares more about selling products now than telling timeless stories. Both overall philosophies are represented in the way these movies were made.\n\nGDT's Pinocchio stands out in a way that no other adaptation has done yet, and feels both timely and timeless at the same time. While the film features the broad story beats of the original novel and countless different versions (Geppetto building the wooden boy, the circus performance, escaping a giant sea creature, his nose growing), it takes unexpected turns and twists in the plot and characterization. These include the creation of the villainous Count Volpe serving as an amalgamation of three different characters from the original story, the titular character being kind of a brat throughout who has to grow from his flaws. Other deviations include, Geppetto's construction of the boy resembling Frankenstein's creation, and a spirit realm serving as a purgatory for every time Pinocchio dies. The film is set in the 1930's in Mussolini's Italy, filled with Nazi salutes and Fascist imagery, up to the point where a military base becomes the new stand-in for Pleasure Island. The World War II setting in Europe inherently gives the film more prestige than most contemporary movies. The animation style was stop-motion, which gives it an imperfect hand-crafted quality that makes it more sophisticated than CGI. In fact, a 30-minute feature was made available to show how the entire crew constructed the sets and puppets, so you know that everyone had to put a lot of care into this movie. Entire backdrops and different-sized models had to be created from scratch to pull off the more sophisticated shots. Plus, it was all done on a budget of $35M, yet it looks so much better than most modern blockbusters that cost $200M or more. With a smaller budget, you know a movie is more likely to be good and not focus-grouped to death.\n\nAs for the contents of the film, it's apparent while watching that it has a great script, with fantastic writing and character development. For instance, it pulls off multiple different tones and blends them all seamlessly, being emotional, creepy, funny, and gut-wrenching all at once. It features scenes of a cricket trying not to get squished, an escape from a sea monster that looks like a horror movie, Pinocchio talking with the spirit of Death about existentialism, a young human child dying in an air raid, the villain abusing his monkey companion, and a show for Mussolini being ruined by Pinocchio making his freedom song about poop. Yet these scenes all manage to co-exist in a narrative that adds to a greater whole while never appearing jarring. Furthermore, there are no out-of-place pop culture references or rap songs, and nobody stops to smell a pile of feces. There are multiple quiet scenes where characters sit down and talk about their feelings, instead of just engaging in non-stop action with tons of bright colors and loud noises. And the voice cast is all great with no miscast celebrity actors, like Tom Holland as Pinocchio, Chris Pratt as Geppetto, Gal Gadot as the Blue Fairy, or James Corden as everyone else. Instead, the film is filled with respected thespian performers and tenured voice actors who fit the characters' personalities well, particularly Ewan MacGregor as the Cricket and Finn Wolfhard as Lampwick being the standouts, along with Tom Kenny as a tiny Mussolini and the great Cate Blanchett as the voice of a monkey! This is the kind of film where I could see tons of video essays and Twitter threads about how it successfully appeals kids and adults simultaneously, just like how we used to praise Pixar and Renaissance-era Disney and Studio Ghibli back in the day.\n\nIn fact, this film is certainly better than Disney's \"live-action\" version from the same year. We all know that the Disney live-action remakes are all soulless cash-grabs with no soul or heart, but this one in particular was egregious. That version may be the most \"uncanny valley\" of the LA remakes yet, with even less internal logic than their retellings of Mulan and The Lion King. The wooden boy looked fake as shit, Jiminy's face looks like he skinned another cricket alive Dwight Schrute-style, and Tom Hanks is stuck in a green-screen room for 40 minutes with his worst accent since Colonel Tom Parker. The entire film feels like it's going through the motions to get from one plot point of the animated film to another, but also spinning its wheels to bloat the runtime toward 2 hours. There were so many poorly-written jokes and scenes that circulated onto Twitter to show how bad it was, from the clocks that reference all the IP's Disney owns, to the unfinished escape from Monstro the Whale, to the title character smelling a CGI pile of crap, to \"Chris Pine\" and \"influencer\" jokes. The worst part is that this cost $180M, over 5x the GDT version, yet it's one of the ugliest-looking films I've ever watched. Even blander movies don't make me want to gouge out my eyes as much as this film, and I'm learning to be more skeptical of a film if it has a higher budget than its scale would suggest. It's almost like Disney was intentionally trying to make a bad movie and tank their own value as a company.\n\nWhich leads me into why Strange World doesn't work. Even though that movie's not based on any pre-existing source material, it is one of the most derivative animated films I've ever watched, without an ounce of creativity. Each element in the film feels like the first-draft version of itself, even down to the title \"Strange World.\" (Yes, I know this is a strange world they're entering, I'm not an idiot like you think your target audience is.) Every plot point was done better in other animated and adventure movies, from Atlantis to Annihilation to countless Miyazaki movies, but this time everything feels rushed over and not properly developed. There's also a ridiculous third-act twist where it turns out they're all inside a living organism, but it's another idea that's not really explored.\n\nThe characters in Strange World are also poorly-written. Everyone is either one-note or a walking cliché of a stock character, and any personality seems to come from the fact that some of them are not straight white dudes. (I mean, seriously, what kind of name is \"Searcher Clade\"?) The film doesn't bother having an antagonist, yet pokes fun at the fact that it doesn't have an antagonist like it thinks that's clever. There are also multiple obvious toy opportunities, from a 3-legged dog to a weird blue blob, who's first seen when a character says \"It's so cute, I want to merchandise it.\" Compare this to the stop-motion Pinocchio, which has no available merchandise and therefore contains more artistic integrity. There's also the issue of Disney's twelfth first openly-gay character. It feels like that character's only source of development in the whole runtime was to give him a relationship with another boy at the beginning, and then have him bumbling around the adventure trying to re-connect with his dad, in a relationship that could easily be solved if they just properly communicated instead of keeping us waiting for another hour. The cast is technically diverse when it comes to gender, race, age. and orientation, but that's where all of their personality stops. If this is how Disney is going to deal with representation in their future movies going forward, then they might as well just give up now.\n\nIt feels like we're in the new-Renaissance version of Treasure Planet, a grander, more serious sci-fi epic that's a bit more mature than the typical animated Disney fare, but unlike that one, Strange World actually *deserved* to bomb. I can't see that movie gaining any kind of cult following the way Treasure Planet did over the last 20 years. Same with Lightyear from earlier this year, a film whose target audience is impossible to determine and whose similar box-office bombing was easy to predict.\n\nActually, come to think of it, every single decision Disney has made over the past decade has come to roost in this Pinocchio/Strange World comparison. As we've been made well-aware over the past decade, Disney is an evil corporation that stifles creativity in the name of profit with everything they touch. They turned Star Wars from the most famous movie franchise in the world to cinematically irrelevant in the span of 4 years, yet they've also over-saturated us with subpar shows on Disney+, indicating that we are both getting not enough and too much Star Wars content since the Lucasfilm purchase. We all know about the trials and tribulations of the Marvel movies. Martin Scorsese was correct in that they are not at all cinema, and they've clearly had no plan since Endgame, and all their movies and shows look like garbage now because there's 20 hours' worth of material per year and no signs of stopping. All their animated films have declined in quality as well, from WDAS and Pixar. The former is just a princess and sequel machine now, with the occasional soundtrack song thrown in as well, while Pixar has had a spotty track record over the last decade and has become super predictable in its storytelling formula. Plus, their latest films have been relegated to the Disney+ gulag, which looks like an insult from corporate, yet watching their latest output since Onward is totally understandable why they'd do this. Not to mention how lazy the live-action remakes are, and how their purchase (and subsequent phasing-out) of 20th Century Fox means they've hamstrung any market for mid-budget adult dramas. Disney is a company that does not deserve any praise for putting out a somewhat-competent product, or even constructive criticism to show how they could improve and make better movies, but rather vitriol and scorn for every fuck-up they make, if only to discourage them from ever trying again.\n\nMeanwhile, this new Pinocchio was made by an auteur who has made his love of cinema from all sorts of different eras and countries known, who has brought forth a singular vision of a timeless story, and who has a distinct style that has won him numerous fans, awards, and online video essays dissecting his work. Plus, he's a great public speaker and marketer and get his messages out into the world so effortlessly. GDT's film seems to have been influenced by the story of Frankenstein, as well as ancient myths and legends and real-world history, whereas Strange World looks like it was influenced by the same generic animated films and self-aware big-budget action films from the last decade, which strips this film of any distinguishable personality. The film was also released by Netflix, a company that wasn't even making original programming 15 years ago and didn't buy centuries' worth of valuable IP, so it had to build all its popular series from scratch. GDT's decision to work with Netflix shows how much they care about the medium of animation and will allow creators to thrive and become popular. Disney used to stand for that for years, working hard to build unforgettable movies with timeless stories and memorable characters, until they suddenly became a force to be reckoned with in the early 2010's. It's getting to the point where I am more skeptical of a movie if it has the Disney logo in front it, and I'm actively steering my friends away from anything that company has a financial stake in and toward something more obscure.\n\nSo despite being another remake of a classic story, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio happens to be one of the most original films I've ever seen. It's inventive, emotional, gorgeously-animated, and made by someone with passion for filmmaking, with great writing and character development that's easy to see on the screen. Meanwhile, despite having original characters and a new setting, Disney Animation's Strange World is one of the most derivative and predictable films I've ever watched, with nary an ounce of imagination. Both of these attitudes are represented in their final onscreen products and production processes. It also proves that just because a movie is original, doesn't necessarily make it good, especially when it has a large budget and studio backing. Meanwhile, even the occasional re-telling can still feel completely fresh when in the hands of the right filmmaker.",

        "text": "NWR, hands down is one of the greatest directors I've seen when it comes to cinematography, and in popularizing the \"neon-noir\" genre. He's done a fantastic job with *Drive* and *The Neon Demon*. I absolutely love the lighting, use of colors, the dark and brooding atmosphere that it creates. I'm especially looking forward to seeing how his upcoming series *Copenhagen Cowboy* turns out. \n\nUnfortunately though, even as someone who's often a fan of his work, I find it a bit difficult to stay connected and engaged during his movies. While *Drive* certainly felt fast-paced enough in my opinion, while balancing all other best parts of Refn's style, I couldn't say the same for *Too Old to Die Young* and *Only God Forgives.* My biggest source of confusion is the long and awkward pauses in conversations that the characters have. For instance as a hypotheticl NWR scene: \n\n**Tom: \"How's it going...Mary?\"** \n\n*\\*30 second pause ensues\\*(sometimes longer)*\n\n**Mary: \"Fine...\"** \n\n**Tom: \"Cool....\"** \n\n*\\*Characters awkwardly stare at each other for another 30-45 seconds\\**\n\n**Mary: \"What do you think about corporations...do you like them?\"** \n\n*\\*Awkward 30 second pause\\** \n\n**Tom: \"I don't know...\"** \n\nThese types of scenes (of course the exact scene won't be 100% like what I depicted above) bother me for two reasons: \n\n1. The dialogue feels drawn out unnecessarily and the pacing doesn't actively contribute to the plot (i.e. it's not b/c there's building tension or anything) \n2. The actual dialogues feel so robotic and unnatural and out of place sometimes...like it's not how actual people talk. \n\nI especially disliked this about *Too Old to Die Young* and it was so bad, that I couldn't watch past the first half of the 4th episode. I've heard Episode 5 was apparently very good, but I was so bored by that point I didn't feel like watching further. Felt similarly about *Only God Forgives.* The cinematography was excellent, but the scenes, character development, and dialogue felt so awkward and unnatural that I couldn't get into it. \n\nHowever...the other part of me feels that I'm missing something deeper. Is there something NWR is trying to convey with these long pauses, seemingly robotic dialogue, and also the awkward silences even in large group events depicted in the movies (i.e. a nightclub where almost everyone is deathly quiet and basically frozen except for the main characters as they traverse through). Is he trying to drive home the cold feeling of isolation in our society, and how human interaction often feels superficial and shallow? \n\nWhat is the reasoning in your opinion?",

I'll admit, I had never heard of it so I thought I'd check it out (fairly easily as it's currently streaming on HBO Max). All I knew going in was the succinct summary on HBO Max: \"A lonely widow turns to prostitution to make ends meet\" and that it is a long film (201 minutes!) with use of real-time sequences.\n\nWhen you read that a film had been judged the greatest of all time, it does color your first watch somewhat. I certainly went into this film hoping it was good. \n\nI absolutely loved this movie. I am so glad it got the top spot in the S&amp;S poll as I doubt I would have checked it out otherwise (even though I'm aware it's been in the full list). It is a challenging watch, mostly due to what doesn't happen as opposed to what does. Those long takes of Jeanne just sitting, or washing dishes, or setting the table, or making the bed, or bathing. It makes the everyday extraordinary. In the moments where we are just watching her drinking a cup of coffee in a cafe, I found myself utterly mesmerized by thinking, \"What is she thinking?\" I grew to feel like I was really watching someone's actual life, in a 'Truman Show' kind of way. \n\nIt is a very long film, but it doesn't *feel* long at all, and as the events progress I felt rewarded for my patience: differences would occur, an accident or mistake that threw things off, and felt like a huge catastrophe for Jeanne. The gradual spiraling of her routine felt so natural and yet dizzying-dreadful at the same time. \n\nIt's an astonishing film, and truly a masterpiece. I'll be checking out more of Chantal Akerman's films now, too, and hope they're just as good.",

I’ve recently taken a Film Studies class called “Stanley Kubrick and his Contemporaries” where we watched most of Kubrick’s films in chronological order from Killer’s Kiss to Eyes Wide Shut along with some others for comparison such as Out of the Past, Ben-Hur, Rosemary’s Baby, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nAt first, I was excited. He’s one of the most well-respected directors of all time. But I haven’t seen any of his films besides The Shining. But pretty soon, I found out that he’s a pretty morally reprehensible person, much like the other straight white men from this period.\n\nHe’s such a misogynist. My professor talked about how misogyny is ingrained into the way films are made. The bullets into the painting of the woman jn Lolita. The femme fatale and distrust of women in film noir. His terrible treatment of Shelly Duval. His worship of other misogynists like Friedrich Niche and Freud. His violent rape scenes in A Clockwork Orange. His evaluation of marriage in Eyes Wide Shut. How can anyone still be watching this guy? He’s promoting very harmful beliefs about women. Why don’t we burn and ban all of his films?\n\nAlso he seems very racist. The Killing and Full Metal Jacket had some slurs. He even said that “Hitler was right about everything” and was a vicious self-hating anti-semite himself. He even made fun of the dangers of nuclear war with the completely unfunny Dr. Strangelove.\n\nIs there something I’m missing? He just seems evil to me, and it’s very difficult for me to enjoy the works of evil men. Why do so many people condone his evil? Is it just “film bros”? All of his films are very boring and pretentious too. 2001, Eyes Wide Shut, Barry Lyndon, and Paths of Glory were incredible bores.",

A lot of people see this show as a super progressive satire of rich people, but I don't really buy that. \n\nMike White isn't conservative, but one can read that into it. I personally think he's either a misanthrope  or just enjoys eating its own (for whatever reason) through art.",

        "text": " Hey, I'm writing this post because I just feel lost. For as long as I remember, I've always wanted to be an actress then I grew older and my passion for acting turned into a love for scriptwriting. My dream would be to be a movie director. The thing is, my family is really poor and film school is too big a risk. maybe some people will say that I don't love cinema enough to pursue it as a passion and take the risk and these people can believe what they want, I suppose I'm not ready to take the risk. Furthermore, I would like to do other things. I tell myself that art is so pure, so personal, one can create it without being necessarily taught. There are other things that you necessarily have to go to school for that I would love to learn and that would assure me financial stability in my future. The thing is, I know art schools are most important for networking / the portfolio which now I can't do.\n\nNow I just feel stuck, I feel like the art form I love is completely out of reach and impossible to me now. It feels to me like what's the most important is networking which is impossible for me to do out of school and I just don't know what to do anymore. I would like to share my creations but how?\n\nI was wondering if there were any good resources on the internet for learning the art? Any recommendations?\n\nAnd what should I do about networking? Is there any way to do that online?\n\nBecause of where I was born and because it now stands on networking and not the love of the art and the skills I can't access my dream. Maybe I'm panicking for nothing but I just feel like my dream is slipping away from me. Thanks so much to anyone that will help!",

        "text": "I was anticipating this reveal to happen at the end, but I was left with the film not going this way at all by the end. And yet, it seems very deliberate that you were supposed to feel Sam was hallucinating the clones, but I never saw this mentioned anywhere online either. \n\nThe film goes to great lengths to depict Sam’s detoriating mental health through out, and also shows him remaining on the Moon way longer than he was supposed to be. Sam 2 does not even acknowledge how bloody and injured Sam 1 is, until really late, as though Sam 2 is just Sam 1’s imagination. \n\nEverything seems to have two interpretations too, like the rescue team coming to cover everything up OR the more sane explanation being that they were just coming to bring an insane Sam back to Earth because he is too far gone to do so on his own. Gerty talking to the bosses on a live feed while communications were not working could be the company lying to Sam OR it could be Sam imagining that happening when he was unconscious in the rover, as that scene happens before ‘Sam 2 brings him back’ (aka he hallucinates and comes back on his own). \n\nThere is even what seems to be foreshadowing, or clues if you will. Sam 1 and Sam 2 fight in one of the scenes. Sam 1 is thrown out of the room by Sam 2. He comes back to the room very bloody and Sam 2 is shocked and says “I didn’t even touch you!”. I interpreted this as Sam ‘fighting’ on his own and injuring himself. The line by Sam 2 could be Sam’s subconscious mind realising the truth for a second. In another scene, Sam 1 tries to figure out the password to his logs, and Gerty helps him. Later on, Sam 2 asks Gerty why it helped him with the password, as though Sam 1 and 2 are the same person. Sam 2 also always wears sunglasses and hides his eyes a lot, which can be interpreted as Sam dissociating Sam 2 from himself. \n\nTo me, the storytelling seems very deliberately reminiscent of The Machinist or Fight Club. Sam 1 looks like a depressed, Trevor from The Machinist, and Sam 2 looks like a paranoid caricature of Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle with his temper, sunglasses and leather jacket, as though he is an imagination of Sam 1. \n\nI was sure this was the ending, and was confused that the film did not acknowledge this. Is this just me? What do you think?",

        "text": "I recently finished David Halberstram's massive tome on politics and the media \"The Powers that Be,\" which meanders through half a century of media history before rising to a crescendo of early 70s newspaper scandals in the Pentagon Papers and Watergate. Halberstram is a master story teller, and despite this book's girth I was left thirsty for more on some of the most fascinating real life characters in the book. More specifically, Katherine Graham and Ben Bradlee. \n\nOf course immediately I went to Alan Pakula's 1976 masterpiece All the President's Men which I have seen but not for some time. Also worth mention that I am a big fan of William Goldman and Adventures in the Screen Trade. Despite having seen the film before, I was completely blown away. You could not ask for a greater ensemble of talent in front of or behind the camera. The film has Goldman's and DP's Gordon Willis' DNA all over it, and I was particularly impressed after having just immersed myself in a long complicated novel about Watergate at just how successful Goldman and the filmmakers were at conveying the absurd amount of information involved in Watergate in a mostly digestible manner. \n\nTo be frank after watching the film I was in such a revere that I became convinced that were it not for the totally lackluster finale of the film which really kneecaps the audience's experience, it would be more consistently in the conversation as one of the best films of all time rather than just being accepted as the best newspaper and conspiracy film of all time. Goldman gives a justification for the ending in his book, but I found that explanation wanting and the reasoning of the audience being too familiar with the real life ending becomes less relevant every passing year. \n\nSo again I was hankering for more films in this vein, this time instead turning to a documentary on Daniel Ellsberg entitled The Most Dangerous Man in America. Formally a somewhat clumsy documentary, it is never the less comprehensive and both benefits and suffers from being a near first person account of Daniel's story. Fascinating information told in a straight forward fashion.\n\nI then remembered that Spielberg had made a movie about The Washington Post a few years ago that I had never gotten around to seeing staring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. Perfect, right up my alley.\n\nAnd unfortunately I found the film to be a massive disappointment. I knew right away that something was off when the film opens with a title card placing us in Vietnam in 1966 set to a Creedance Clearwater Revival song recorded in 1970. I'm not sure if the anachronism or the cliche was worse. This would kick off what I consider to be a lazy and forgettable movie. All of the parts are there, but there did not seem to be any artistic ambition at all. \n\nI can't help but wonder if I had not watched it in such close proximity to All the President's Men if it would have fared better, though of course the ending of The Post draws direct parallels to the film. \n\nThe movie just cannot compete in terms of script, photography, acting and directing. The exposition in The Post is delivered in such ham-handed ways like when Katherine Graham's daughter recalls to her the time she visited LBJ's ranch. I absolutely hate it when movies deliver exposition like this: having one character tell another something they already know, nobody in real life talks this way. \n\nEverybody in The Post is constantly spoon feeding the audience telling them how important this or that is, how difficult this or that decision is. It's so drab and boring. Compare to one of the opening scenes of All the President's Men:\n\n&gt;  WOODWARD at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but \n               it's hard.\n     \n                                     JUDGE\n                         And what is your occupation, Mr. \n                         McCord?\n\n                                     MCCORD\n                              (softly)\n                         Security consultant.\n\n                                     JUDGE\n                         Where?\n\n                                     MCCORD\n                              (softer)\n                         Government.

In Halberstram's book, he shares the story of journalist Ben Bagdikian (played by Bob Odenkirk in The Post) in the heat of the argument with the Post's attorneys over whether or not they had the right to publish the Pentagon Papers saying \"The only way to assert the right to publish is to publish.\" Ben Bradlee is described as glowing with admiration at the words that have just come out of his reporter's mouth.\n\nOnly in the movie, these words are given to Ben Bradlee to say, and he originally says them not in the throws of a desperate struggle for the 1st amendment but in regards to which reporter will cover Nixon's daughters wedding. These kinds of details are totally unimportant for the average viewer, but with historical drama the more familiar you are with the story the more likely you will be annoyed by the unnecessary change to details. This isn't a case of needing to streamline things to keep the story moving, the words are still said and Bagdikian is still there in the scene. It's just to give the big star of the movie a little more shine. Another example is when secluded in his motel, Ellsberg tells Bagdikian the line \"Wouldn't you go to jail to stop the war?\" which after watching his documentary you know that he did in fact say this, except not to a reporter in a motel room but to a reporter outside of a courthouse surrounded by a huge crowd of people. \n\nAnother dimension of my thesis of this post: the familiarity of the variety of character actors playing bit parts in this film. Having Bob Odenkirk and David Cross playing across from each other in a period drama completely took me out of the movie and put me in a Mr. Show sketch. \n\nThere were so many character that could have done with some unknown character actor, but instead we get Bradley Whitford playing smarmy meanie for the 1,000 time, or Jessie Plemons and Alison Brie with 2 scenes each. I like these actors, but giving these two bit parts to such recognizable faces again just seems to me to draw attention to the artifice of what is supposed to be the retelling of a true story. \n\nWhich brings me to Mr. Hanks. I love Tom Hanks as much as the next person, but I found him down right awful in this film. He doesn't seem to be making any real choices, he's just playing Tom Hanks with a slightly gruff voice. Again it's unfortunate, but you cannot help but compare him to Jason Robards Oscar winning turn as Ben Bradlee and find this performance incredibly wanting. Bradlee is described as a person with immense charm and Robards is able to get that across in very little screen time. In those brief glimpses, you see how he controls his newsroom with his aloofness, his interactions and manifold relationships with a variety of subordinates, and the change over the course of the film in his treatment of Woodward and Bernstein.\n\nHanks on the other hand is given the whole movie and his chemistry with every other actor, even Meryl Streep, is non-existent. There appears to be absolutely nothing under the surface of any of these relationships, despite the fact that there was a TON of truly interesting material to mine especially his relationships with Katherine Graham and Bagdikian. With Katherine they scratch the surface, but that is all. A truly disappointing and forgettable non-entry into the Hanks (and Spielberg) canon.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/zzfgv0/what_is_the_significance_of_female_nudity_in_21/",
        "text": "I'm not familiar with Alejandro González Iñárritu's other films, but I personally found the way he included female nudity in 21 Grams disjointed from the rest of the film. It's a rather sensitive film, but then there is a scene in which we get an extended close-up shot of Naomi Watts' bare breasts, and there are a few seconds when you can't even see her face, it's just her breasts. If the point was to reflect her character's emotional journey (it's the first time she makes love to another man after the death of her husband), shouldn't her face be part of the shot? Of course, maybe there wasn't a point to it other than showcasing nudity for the sake of nudity (I'm not trying to say this is either good or bad). \n\nYou could also argue that Iñarritu's intention was to reflect how much Paul and Cristina (the characters played by Sean Penn and Naomi Watts) enjoy each other and that they're able to have fun. But the director still chose to emphasize her breasts for some reason, Paul even plays with her nipples. We didn't see Cristina playing with Paul's butt. \n\nThe only thing I can come up with is that we learn that her character is pregnant by the end of the film, so maybe that was the point. Associating female breasts with pregnancy (lactation). It's a bit far-fetched.\n\nIt's a very interesting film (I personally love Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography) and I don't think the movie is better or worse for including nudity, but I didn't understand the choice to leave Naomi Watts' face out of frame while Sean Penn is sucking her nipples. It doesn't seem *deep* or *sensitive* to me, which is the vibe I get from the film as a whole.\n\nIn another movie starring Naomi Watts, Mulholland Drive, there is a scene in which the characters played by Laura Harring and Naomi Watts get naked and have sex. That scene (even if it might have been surprising) didn't feel disjointed from the rest of the film because their faces were visible and it matched the eerie and mysterious vibe the rest of the film had. \n\nYou might be wondering why I am so curious about this particular scene. If I had seen the exact same scene in another movie I probably wouldn't think twice about it, but considering it's part of a very deep film about raw human emotion the choice to include nudity in a way that to me feels gratuitous is a bit perplexing, like it's part of another film.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of the 21 Grams reviews I've read mention or analyze the nudity.",

        "text": "Jackson's King Kong gets varying responses. There is no set consensus on the film a good 2 decades in. In fact when PJ is talked about, it is either for his excellent in bringing LOTR to screen or his failure in doing The Hobbit justice. A small section of his fans do talk about his small scale horror films pre LOTR. But KK barely gets a mention except from fans of Kong, one of cinema's iconic character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPJ was a Kong fan too and the 33 original classic was his favorite movie, After striking gold with LOTR, PJ could have done anything he wanted and it is interesting how Kong was his choice (although he was planning Kong for a long while). In 05, he got a mammoth $200M budget to go make the movie he wanted. And the money as well as the effort shows. King Kong has all the  technical flair present which we saw earlier in LOTR. It is a proper epic and when the marketing stated \"From the Director of LOTR\" it was not hard to believe once the movie started. From its recreation of 30s New York, to the tumultuous boat ride to Skull Island, the island sequence with the natives, to the grandeur of Skull Island and its various fascinating creatures to finally back to New York and Empire State Building, the excellent work of the set/production designers, vfx crew, costume designers, prop designers, cinematographers, sound guys is all there to see. You do get the idea that Jackson is having a lot of fun but at the same time he is paying tribute to his beloved film and wants to do proper justice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeyond the action and visuals, the work on the human characters is notable too. The 3 hour runtime isn't just made for CGI-fest, although that is all a Kong movie needs to be in all honesty. Jackson &amp; his writers go deep into the background of his characters. In part it is a movie about filmmakers. Egoistic yet ambitious directors, struggling actors, pompous movie stars &amp; successful script writers. And not just the film crew, Jackson also develops the boat crew as well. The Captain of the boat, the cook (played by Andy Serkis), the senior officer Hayes who is often seen schooling the adventurous Jamie Bell's character in the movie. I mean beyond Naomi Watts's character the rest don't NEED to be developed keeping the context in mind. It is a monster movie after all. But the work done on the characters shows Jackson wants you to be invested in the story. Was he making a prestige picture akin to LOTR and expecting awards?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis King Kong is also really well developed. At least as good as an animal character can be in a movie. I won't write much but just link to 3 scenes that help you get attached to the character and see him in some 3 dimensional form:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ghrraB8mTU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ghrraB8mTU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HRy9ygjD9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HRy9ygjD9M)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u1nAH0L7BE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u1nAH0L7BE)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are fans of the movie, I am a big one too. And it is generally rated favorably. However, a big criticism which I concede to as well is that it is too lengthy. At 188 minutes, the movie doesn't have substance to justify such a runtime. I wouldn't propose cutting an hour of it as some would suggest, but maybe a good 20-25 minutes could have been removed. For instance the Dinosaur stampede scene which lasts for a good 7-8 minutes is pure fluff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut on the other hand you have a director working on a massive budget and using it really well whilst executing a film he is passionate about &amp; it shows. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid Jackson go overboard with King Kong? Or is it fine to allow a director full creative control and allow them to fully execute their vision? Does his film stand apart from the majority of monster movies or is the depth he tries to put in the film unnecessary?",

        "text": "*LINK: https://youtu.be/Yy8UyaE2me8*\n\nDisclaimer: Hey r/TrueFilm! What you see here, both in the VIDEO ESSAY linked above and the write-up down below, is an essay I wrote on Steven Spielberg's THE FABELMANS. The essay dives deep into how this film acts as Spielberg's love letter to his upbringing, life, and the art of movie-making. For those who want to watch the video, click the link above. Otherwise, I hope you all enjoy the essay below and look forward to hearing your thoughts on it!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhether you’ve been watching my videos since September 2020 when I posted my first video essay on the Snyder Cut or watching since I posted about School of Rock, I think the one thing you’ve all come to realize about me is that I LOVE MOVIES. Everything, down to the last-minute detail… everything about movies is just fascinating to me. I loved film ever since my mom started showing me the Walt Disney animated movies collection on VHS, while my dad introduced me to storied franchises like Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and X-Men at probably too young of an age. Movies bring us together, help us escape to new worlds, better understand our own planet and the people in it… and best of all, they can help us look deep within our lives so that we may accept and understand our time on this planet. There’s just nothing like the movies, but I bet you’re asking why I’m singing the praises of the storytelling medium I love the most in this world. \n\nSee, THIS YEAR had the privilege to attend the second-last day of the Toronto International Film Festival. I used to attend the festival as a member of the press, but this past event, I was just a fan. A fan who could drag his friends to an 11am showing, get popcorn with extra butter, and sit down to watch Steven Spielberg’s newest film, The Fabelmans. A fictionalized take on his own life and his journey toward becoming a film director, THE FABELMANS acts as a way for Spielberg to come to terms with his own life, his relationship with his parents, and his undying love for film as an art form. I think I’ve said at least a few times now that Spielberg is my favourite director and JURASSIC PARK is my favourite movie. Clearly, I have a bias toward this man, and when it was announced that Spielberg would finally be coming to TIFF, I knew I had to see this movie. \n\nAnd through no shock whatsoever, not only did I love FABELMANS, I think it might be one of Spielberg’s greatest works ever. An intensely intimate, emotionally gut-wrenching, and surprisingly hilarious journey of a boy trying to fulfill his dreams, THE FABELMANS had me falling in love with film all over again. I knew that after I walked out of that theatre, I needed to write about it. I needed to go to my own artistic outlet because that’s the kind of movie this is… a story where you better understand your own life, the hardships you’ve faced, and the lives of those around you, while also celebrating the achievements, advancements, and artistry of motion pictures. THE FABELMANS is Spielberg’s love letter to life, and to the cinema, and that’s what I’m here to talk to you about today. So, as always, my name’s Nick Poulimenakos, grab a snack, subscribe to the channel, smash that like button, and let's jump into my final video essay of 2022… \n\nIn THE FABELMANS, we see Spielberg, portrayed here as Sammy Fabelman, navigate his upside-down life. His mother is a former concert pianist turned homemaker, while his father is an engineer. Both are present for Sammy’s first trip to the movies, where he’s instantly hooked on the art form thanks to the film, THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, which features one of the greatest crash sequences in film history. From there, Sammy’s love for film continues to blossom. He begins shooting home movies for his family, as well as short films and feature-length projects with his friends. As this happens though, Sammy experiences several hardships alongside his family, such as various moves across the country, antisemitic classmates, his father seeing his love for him as nothing more than a hobby, and worst of all, his mother seemingly falling in love with his father’s best friend, Benny, played wonderfully by Seth Rogen. Above all else, as I said earlier, this film very much seems to be Spielberg coming face to face with his life. He seeks to make sense of all it, more so than what he’s tried to do with his past features. \n\nIt’s no secret that the divorce of Spielberg’s parents has long impacted his movies. In many of them, he’s tried to reconcile with the pain he felt over his parents splitting up, but in those movies, that familial aspect was never the ultimate focus of the story. A major part of it, sure, but there was still an alien to rescue, or dinosaurs to escape from. That’s not the case in THE FABELMANS. Here, it’s the main focus, and we get an in-depth look as to how Spielberg ultimately views his family life and his love for filmmaking. In short, I thought it was rather beautiful how the story of the Fabelman family is portrayed. For Spielberg, or in this case, Sammy, it’s clear that he doesn’t harbor hate for his mother, or what happened between her and his father. That doesn’t mean there isn’t pain here, but… it’s complicated. \n\nSee, it was Sammy’s mother who always supported his dreams of being a filmmaker. Not to say that his father didn’t, after all, it was his camera that Sammy uses to shoot movies, his father assists on his film sets, and he even bought Sammy an advanced editing machine when Sammy began shooting more elaborate projects. But his father still viewed his filmmaking aspirations as a hobby… something that Sammy will grow out of when he enters the quote-unquote real world. Any artist can relate to that sentiment… a parent who is unable to see your dreams the way you do. Sammy is often at odds with filmmaking with his father, but not his mother. His mother is a former artist herself, so she, more than anyone, can see why Sammy loves film so much. She used to be a concert pianist, but moved on from it and became a homemaker. It’s obvious that she loves her family and husband, but something is missing from her… something that she longs for but can never find. For some time now, she’s been unable to explore that artistic side of herself, so when Sammy discovers his passion for film, she backs him unconditionally and encourages him to pursue his dreams. \n\nBut that’s where things get complicated, as it’s Sammy’s home movies that eventually reveal to him that his mother has fallen for someone else. In any other movie, I feel as though the story would take the easy way out and simply villainize the mother who cheats on her husband. But here, Spielberg opts for a different portrait. Spielberg doesn’t outright characterize his mother as the villain in this. Selfish? Maybe… especially in the eyes of a kid who’s seeing his family break down around him. But not a villain. In crafting this story, I think that Spielberg has finally come to terms with his maternal relationship… accepting that people are complicated and there’s not much else to it. As Frank Sinatra once said… that’s life. It may not be pretty all the time, but everyone only gets one. We can spend it feeling angry, or we can seek to understand, forgive, move on, and live life to the fullest. Wow, that was corny… but I get judging by the title of this essay, it was always going to be a bit corny. Anyways, back to the video. \n\nIn the film, Sammy says that while his mother is making a supposedly selfish decision by leaving the family to be with Benny, he also sees that she needs to be happy, as she hasn’t been for some time. It isn’t because his father was a bad person or someone who refused to love… if anything, even with all their disagreements, Sammy’s father is a perfectly fine person. You can see through how his father’s role in all this formulated Spielberg’s mindset towards fathers in his own films, where they are either absent or battling their own familial demons. Spielberg leaves no stone unturned when it comes to painting as accurately of a frame as possible when it comes to his family. \n\nAnd through all of that, he and Sammy realize that pain can come from anywhere, even when things seem fine. Sometimes one person in a relationship does nothing specific to warrant the other person falling for someone else. Sometimes that love is too strong to keep within, and no matter how mad you get at that person for the decisions they’ve made, sometimes it’s better to accept them for who they are. Sammy’s mother loves her son, loves her daughters, and still has a love for Sammy’s dad. But her heart had other plans, and with this story, Spielberg can finally accept that and move on from it. \n\nThat last line though is easier said than done, and while 75-year-old Steven Spielberg may be ready to pack everything up and move on, the same can’t be said for younger Spielberg, or, once again in this case, Sammy. His mother’s emotional affair wasn’t the only thing he went through. Sammy faces numerous hardships in THE FABELMANS, but the one thing that’s always there for him, through thick and thin, is the movies. I said it at the beginning of this essay that movies can show us real truths, escape to new worlds, and help us release the emotions we have inside of us. Sammy’s love for cinema exceeds being a fan of it. He needs it to live, needs it to survive, and needs it to make sense of the world he’s living in. As Sammy’s world concurrently crumbles and rebuilds itself, it’s movies where he finds peace. \n\nFilms are what Sammy uses to make sense of everything… in a scene where he confronts one of his high school bullies (a rather touching scene I should say, as Sammy and the bully actually become somewhat friends by the end of it), Sammy says that films allow him control over his otherwise uncontrollable life. When he’s behind the camera, he’s in charge, he’s in calling the shots, and everyone looks to him to lead. Unlike his real life, Sammy is in control of every single aspect of a movie, and because of that, filmmaking almost becomes a drug to him… something he can’t, or even refuses to, live without. \n\nAnd that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Spielberg shows the good and bad sides of becoming engulfed in your passions. They help us escape, re-think, or even reshape the world we live in, but they can also greatly impact those in our lives, both in good and bad ways. It’s his devotion to filming that shows him what his mother is hiding from the family, but his devotion is also what keeps him going. No matter how hard life gets, no matter how loud the world seems… filmmaking is always there for Sammy. There’s such inherent beauty and inspiration in that and it’s something we can all relate to. \n\nThis film, above all else, is a celebration of the filmmaking craft. The intricate, detailed, complicated, yet fascinating moving parts that go into making a motion picture. Spielberg spends long stretches of time showcasing how Sammy makes his films, the hard work they take, and the innovative techniques he comes up with in order to get the perfect shot. It’s not news to anyone that Spielberg loves filmmaking, nor how films are made, but in The Fabelmans, it’s as if we’re taking inside the mind of Spielberg, seeing every gear turn inside that insanely creative brain of his that’ll eventually lead to getting the shot he desires for his films.  \n\nThere’s never a moment where we rush past how something is shot, how someone is directed, or how a sequence gets edited. It’s all here on display to tell you all that filmmaking is hard, hard work, but it’s so… damn… beautiful. Spielberg is pouring his heart out here when it comes to his relationship with his chosen profession. Filmmaking helped him break away from the worries of his own life, and for the last 40-something years, he’s been helping us do the same. Whether it’s transporting us to an island filled with dinosaurs, or taking us on a journey to find the holy grail, films are wondrous creations that should be cherished, studied, critiqued, and embraced. Films can help us escape, teach us things we might not have known, tell universal stories with people from different walks of life, and, as I’ve said a few times now in this video, help us come to terms with pain and trauma we may have experienced… just like they did with Sammy, and just like they did with Spielberg. \n\nSteven Spielberg is a personal hero of mine. Someone who I greatly admire, both as a filmmaker and as a person. His films make up some of my earliest memories when it comes to watching movies in general. He’s someone who was able to channel his pain and hardship into his dream and love of storytelling, and in The Fabelmans, we get an in-depth, albeit somewhat fictionalized take on how all of that transpired. In the end, what I think this film does is act almost like an epilogue to Spielberg’s storied career up until this point. Every emotion he’s ever felt for his family and filmmaking is on full display here. All the pain in his heart, confusion in his brain, and happiness in his work… Spielberg sums up his entire journey with The Fabelmans. He finds closure in his upbringing and celebrates the craft that we all talk about day in and day out. I never knew I needed a film about Steven Spielberg’s life and love of the movies, but my god man… I’m so glad we got it. It’s one of those stories that had me hugging my mom as soon as the movie finished, and thinking about it for days on end. What a story, what a director, what a life… what a dream. Oh, and before I forget… if you’re making a movie, whether it’s big or small, always remember: if you put the horizon of your setting centre-frame, it’s boring!",

        "text": "The Woodsman (2004) is an American film directed by Nicole Kassell that explores a pedophile returning to his hometown after many years in prison. Sex offenders are some of the most maligned outcasts in society at large. They're viewed as evil, perverted, and irreparably damaged. \n\nThe power of cinema, like other forms of fiction, is the ability to adopt a perspective entirely different from one's own. Usually, this is for the purpose for fantasy (imagining being Spiderman or James Bond), but this film requires you to see through the eyes of the people most of us hate more than anyone else. It tests your empathy and limits of compassion.\n\nI also appreciated the ordinary, silent quality of the film. Most \"evil\" characters in cinema *look* evil (i.e., Voldemort), so that their outside appearance matches their internal character. But here, evil is brought down to Earth, made banal. We must confront the idea he is like the rest of us, the product of many forces larger than ourselves. This isn't to excuse his crime, but to better understand it. Even if we hold him entirely responsible, his struggle is very real. Alienation, fear for his safety, disgust. In one scene, someone points in his direction at work. He gets self-conscious and scared, only to see it was directed at someone behind him. As social creatures, not much can be more painful and The Woodsman captures this in a very real, visceral way",

        "text": "So to give some background a few years I really got into watching movies and all the classics I could. Whether it was the silent cinema works of Chaplin, Keaton, Lang or some of the more recent acclaimed films, whether it was films of Hollywood's Golden Age or New Hollywood, whether it was the works of foreign masters like Kurosawa, Ozu, Bergman, Tarkovsky etc. or the beloved pop culturally popular films of the 80s. I checked and my IMDB top 250 list is around 80% complete, Letterboxed Top 250 list is around 60% complete, TSPDT around 35% complete and I have seen more than half of the films in both the polls of the Sight and Sound 2022. Suffice to say while I have obviously not seen every great movie ever made, I have seen a decent amount of them at this point.\n\nYet when I look at 2023 and the films I am most excited to watch, the ones I will actively make an effort for it is mainly just the mainstream Hollywood blockbusters. Movies like Mission Impossible 7, John Wick 4, Guardians of Galaxy 3, Across the Spider verse, Indiana Jones 5 etc. There will be a few movies from auteurs I really care about that I am excited to see like Killers of Flower Moon, Oppenheimer and The Killer but mostly it is the mainstream fare and in total I think around 10-12 films (depending on whether something like Megalopolis will make this year or not).\n\nI guess at this point I don't feel the curiosity anymore. I dipped my toes into all kinds of cinema and after all that I realised my taste is mainly the mainstream stuff only.  There are a few directors I will keep a track on but like Nolan, Scorsese or Fincher etc. are hardly some indie directors right now.  My question is that do you feel this kind of burnout too? Do you also revert back to the mainstream stuff to enjoy?",

Are we supposed to think that both she and the professor are equally \"bad\" here? I didn't get that at all. \n\nI was thinking Macy's professor character was a good guy trying to relate to her and help her. I can't find any avenue where the professor is even close to as manipulative and vicious as the student. Yes the ending sort of \"levels it out\", and he shouldn't have physically struck her, but 99% of the movie till that point he was being kind and making sacrifices to try to help her.  She appreciated none of it and then rewards him with a phony rape accusation. \n\nIn my view, Carol the student was the clear \"bad guy\" of this movie. An immature, selfish, manipulative brat. AT MOST you could say Macy's character was a little theatrical and preachy and grandstanding when he shouldn't have been, but that's not even close to the level of depraved as Carol.\n\nI believe she knew exactly what she was doing with the legal weasel words, and I believe Macy called it out perfectly in the very beginning when he said he thinks she's just \"angry\".\n\nCarol, to me, seemed like she was angry at either Macy personally for not understanding his class, or education in general for always being too hard for her. She was lashing out and wanted a sense of control over something she historically struggled with and had trouble \"keeping up\" with. Her actions and intentionally destroying Macy's life were just methods of feeling power in an arena she typically feels powerless in. It's kind of demonstrated by her ridiculous demands at the end about what books she personally wants the school to allow and not allow. She wanted to feel \"in control\" and wanted to get rid of anything she didn't like or understand.\n\nI don't think she was acting in good faith, I believe the Professor was acting in good faith and was genuinely trying to help her up until she \"turned\" on him and started trying to destroy him.\n\nWhat was your take on this movie? Are they equally \"bad guy\"?",

        "text": "Park Chan Wook's 'Decision to Leave' is an erotic thriller with a simple plot: the detective falls for the suspect and makes errors in his investigation. What sets this film apart from any other erotic mystery is its poetic narrative and the director's vision.\n\nThe film is flushed with poetic lines. The Monday Grandma says \"I pray on Fridays for Mondays to come quickly (indicating she likes Song Seo Rae who takes care of her on Mondays) but sometimes Mondays come faster\" - an allegory to her rapidly approaching death. In between barely hanging on to the last remaining thread of his failing marriage- weekend sex and his growing infatuation for Song- the suspect, he is hellbound on exonerating her. He has an explanation for all her actions- when his partner comments on how Song has no grief for her dead husband, he says \"To some grief covers like an envelop, to others, it's a slowly spreading ink.\"\n\n'Decision to Leave' is a film that plays on metaphors, plays on opposite extremes- like the sea and the mountain. The detective says and does contradictory things- he orders his coworkers to not eat expensive meals but brings expensive sushi for the suspect. When his wife asks him to bring sushi, he refuses to do so by making up an alibi. The growing disconnect between the detective and his wife is seen when the director takes away the focus from the detective having sex with his wife to a sex scene on the TV with only the girl in view, showing how the sexual relationship has only one interested party left. The focus then shifts to sex with a skeleton insisting on how the love between the couple has died. This follows up with the detective lying to his wife about the case. The death of love culminates in the scene where Song goes to the mountain to blow away her grandfather's ashes metaphorising blowing away the ashes of love between the detective and his wife.\n\nWhile the distance between the detective and his wife grows, it shortens between him and the suspect. When he is staking out Song through binoculars, he is shown to be in her space- smelling her, feeling her. They start having inside jokes now. They share a laugh over Song's insufficient Korean- they laugh over the word solitary during an investigation, symbolising laughing away his loneliness. After the investigation, the detective starts cleaning the table, but the suspect takes over the cleaning cloth from his hand. Only their hands are shown as if a married couple's.\n\n'Decision to Leave' is a thriller film filmed through the artistic lens of an auteur. That's why when Song says she is different from the other Chinese refugees that came to Korea, the camera shows the detective, but only shows the mirror image of Song- making her stand out. I can see why critics call this film \"Hitchcockian\"- Park Chan Wook doesn't play on the theme of 'Who Dunnit'; rather, like Alfred Hitchcock, he tells you who the suspect is and develops an artistic narrative around it. It is a film that is truly cherishable.",

        "text": "Long winded. Chaotic. Abruptly hilarious while maintaining for it's small scenes of true sincerity. The characters work for me, even exceptionally when Chazelle uses Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt as the two focal points of the opening party, and the whimsical entryway into Hollywood for Manny. Party life was the same as work life, and the stars shined brightest when they were in control of chaos, and this is during the SILENT movie era. Ego was out of control for everyone involved in the business, something known as a timeless trope throughout the history of the film industry. Chazelle molded his own theory of Hollywood, with what felt like an endless callback to all eras of filmmaking, and made more of a fun thril-ride version of Eyes Wide Shut, while riding a Sunset Boulevard subplot with Jack Conrad (Pitt). Even though there's novelty in the Tobey McGuire scenes, I still felt it could've been left on the cutting room floor, at the expense of completing the Nellie-Manny \"relationship\" being put into scrutiny via owing money to a powerful underworld boss. Brad Pitt did nothing but shine in each of his parts, Margot Robbie was in complete control and had fantastic chemistry with the Female Director and Diego Calva. My overall thoughts on this film have been within such dissonance ever since. There's parts that get kinda campy, but remain fun, and some of the serious tone doesn't convey truthfully, even in the Rothschilds party scene ending on a complete meltdown by Nellie, and a puke-gag. Yet, we learn of the deaths of several characters via headlines in the newspaper, the same way we've seen the passing of iconic figures of film in our own lives, but poignantly silent, even though these stars that will \"dine with angels and ghosts\" until the end of time. Simultaneously forgetting and condensing all notion, the ending sequence spirals to the endless Jazz solo over the flowing of dyes through liquid, in my interpretation, a total minimalist replication of the opening party scene. Surrealism through the usage of iconic movie scenes and moments became another point of interest, as Manny's reaction to seeing Marilyn Monroe typecast as Nellie was the inciting incident. My thought was that Manny saw the greed and hostile nature of the business but still made it. He saw the figures all around him and thought of Nellie and Jack as icons, true people of a \"once in a lifetime\" nature. But their reincarnation onscreen became overwhelming in feeling their presence again, but also that Hollywood rejected and callously ended their relationship with these figures, but they still allow them to exist and almost live in a purgatory, while the audience of common people just see the magic onscreen, and not the souls. With this feeling, it surprised me that so many on /r/movies were agreeing on how fantastic the shoutouts were, while I felt like it was just staged evidence of how unoriginal, and formed around a shell the true business of Hollywood is. Old Hollywood has always been a fun visit, and even movies like Hail Caesar! point out the goofiness and self-importance while not going fully in depth. Chazelle made a statement here, no matter what your interpretation may be, but a film like this that seems to actually understand the often dubious history of Hollywood, but shows that the magic is very real too. Seeing Persona being flashed by in the midst of what felt to be a visual ego-crisis did give me chills however. \n\nOverall, it may just be the Chazelle film that takes a few years to simmer before we seriously appreciate it, because I kind of feel like I still have a hangover.....",

You can read my take on it [here](https://letterboxd.com/robotlolz/film/audition/) if you’re interested. \n\nBut I was a little surprised on letterboxd to see the number of people that view audition as a feminist #metoo revenge movie. I think it’s a valid take, but somewhat coloured by modern western perceptions. I also think there’s a slightly mysoginist “that bitch is crazy” take that’s equally valid.  \n\n[Tony Rayns addresses this divide](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T3fjSa-WMJw) in a special feature available on the Arrow cult movie streaming service. There’s a feminist take, a misogynist take, and a neutral take, and he takes the view that the movie is more neutral, which I largely agree with. He highlights the fact that Japan doesn’t have a modern feminist movement as such, suggesting that it’s one of the least feminist developed nations. \n\nIn the movie Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) plays an aging widower who puts out a casting call with the ulterior motive that he wants to meet women. This is obviously a sleezy maneuver, calling to mind the “casting couch” and portraying an uncomfortable power dynamic. But Aoyama isn’t a Harvey Weinstein. He’s trying to get a date. He never forces himself on anyone, he’s not a rapist. His biggest sins are dating a woman under false pretences, and not being attracted to a woman in his office that wants to date him. \n\nThe 24 year old woman he dates, Asami Yamazaki, is also a liar. She carefully conceals her own damaged psyche while being courted by this older man. She comes by her trauma honestly however, she is the victim of a life time of abuse from men with positions of power over her. Still she initiates the sex between them, and is never pressured by Aoyama, and he very early on tells her that the project the casting call was for has been cancelled. He is not dangling a carrot in front of her to coerce her.\n\nI’m curious about true films take on the feminist/misogynist/neutral aspect of Audition. Personally I think they’re all pretty valid, and that’s what has my brain juices flowing about this movie a day after watching it. Maybe there is no “correct” answer and maybe that’s why the movie is compelling. To me the movie was more about codependency and was fairly neutral in as much that you could have either gender be the possessive, jealous, codependent partner. That said the feminism aspect demands to be addressed given the genders and the power dynamics at play in the movie.",

Consider her pink wig, her duality (bare yet defensive, vunerable yet indifferent, naieve yet worldly, honest yet clothed in lies), her mystery, and how she appears and disappears altogether\n\nNot to mention Portman's cherubic features\n\nThe three characters have romance and \"love\" enter their lives momentarily but as they are emotionally immature and strangers to themselves they are unable to truly connect to or understand each other\n\nThey may be able to feign maturity, speak eloquently, and behave in a condescending manner towards Alice but they are slaves to their impulsives\n\nBy the end of the film Jude Law's character reverts to his original self. In the original play the three characters are torn asunder again looking at her gravestone with no knowledge gained after her death. The ending sequence with the traffic accident is like a continuation of the beginning sequence. A fleeting thing that leaves you wondering if it had ever been. Was it real? Did I really ever know the person? Was it love?",

        "text": "And this troubles me immensely. As a screenwriter and filmmaker (written several scripts, directed a short film of my own) I know the things that I love and want to, and have, emulated in my own work. Yet when I watch a movie I don’t like, I can never truly understand why. If someone were to ask me why I didn’t like a movie, I’d struggle to reply and might default to something like “it just wasn’t my cup of tea.”\n\nBut surely there are concrete reasons to like or dislike anything. Things I should be able to select and point out and describe. But I can’t! And I suppose being able to describe the things you don’t like a work is an important skill in criticism. \n\nHow can I get better at discerning and describing my tastes? How do you all do it? How do you move beyond that unconscious gut feeling and into tangible criticism?",

        "text": "TLDR: this felt like throwing up after a meal of Conan the Barbarian and The Fast and The Furious. What am I not getting?\n\nI recently watched this for the first time and was incredibly disappointed. I found the movie mediocre, if not poor, on every dimension of analysis I took:\n- plot: there’s 20 minutes worth of it;\n- character depth and development: risible e.g. how Nux completely abandons his belief system and changes sides with barely any justification;\n- dialogue: scarce and with absolutely no substance;\n- music: mediocre;\n- cinematography: mediocre with some useless CGI stunts (what was the point of that sandstorm 15 minutes into the movie?);\n- general aesthetic: poor with little refinement or artistic depth. \n\nMoreover, as with many (IMO poor) action films, the plot is plagued with ad hoc additions to artificially increase tension but without posing any credible threat to the main characters or introducing any deviations from the plot’s expected outcome (which IS the real source tension and is normally intrinsic to the plot). For me, the telltale sign of such poor writing is the introduction of surprisingly convenient meteorological effects (see the sandstorm at the beginning of the film).\n\nI gave this movie a go after seeing a score of 8 on IMDb. Usually I find IMDb ratings very consistent. At first I though this rating may be a consequence of media hype but surely after ~7 years since it’s release the score is past the first months/years of hype. \n\nI feel I must be misunderstanding something about this movie to be so far off the mainstream opinion. Can anyone explain what I might be missing?\n\nOtherwise, what could be the cause for such undue acclaim?",

        "text": "So obviously this question was sparked by reactions to to Avatar: The Way of water and the discourse around that entire franchise. Specifically it's always annoyed me  when people say things like \"well if it weren't for the visuals, nobody would like those films.\" On the one hand there is a grain of truth to the criticism. The visuals are by far the strongest aspect of the films,, and both movies feature basic plots and archetypal characters. I'm not disputing that. My issue is with the specific way these criticisms are phrased and the implications that that phrasing has.\n\nWhen a high profile film comes out, and it's main strength is its visuals, people will always talk about the films visuals in a way that makes them seem like they're superfluous and can't be counted as a real strength of the film. Why? I can't recall ever hearing anyone say \"Man, this movie's not actually good. If it weren't for it's mind-blowing script no one would like it\" or \"dude I don't get why people like this film, if it weren't for the entire cat putting on an absolute master class in acting no one would care about it,\" and yet many people talk about films visuals in this way.\n\nFilm is primarily a visual medium. That's one of the things that fundamentally sets it apart from other mediums like novels or live theatre, so why is it that visuals and visual storytelling are frequently treated as the least important aspects of a film, rather than one of its most important and defining ones?",

        "text": "There's a problem of speed in this movie... The speed of the ideas contrasts with the slowness of the main character, like a parallel between tradition and modernity. Actions scenes are neither slow nor quick though , they're instantaneous, split second instants, but that do take screen times for the viewer, and for  that reason the movie struggles to keep up its duality between speed and  slowness. On paper, the movie could have worked. It's once put on the pellicule that it becomes difficult. One second on screen is one second that happened in the reality of the narrative, we don't have access to abstractions like in a written work, as viewers. The show *does* go on, which is inconvenient for the pace of this movie. The actions scenes fail to blend with the flow of time of the story and they fail at feeling like slices of time for us.\n\nI'm not sure if the director could have done anything against that. The problem with this  type of movie is that modernity takes all the space. At least in our big budget western cinema. We expect movies to be always quick. There is no shared experience of Tradition in the west, not since the spaghetti westerns, we forgot what is slowness entirely, speed is the only virtue that we recognize in our society, and thus, Ladybug is doomed to remain (in appearance) a dim character. Ladybug's rare innocence for an adult fails to find our attention. We do not recognize how unlucky this man must feel. We simply lack empathy when we find that it's his own decision to be naive. In the cultures that haven't fallen into cynicism, he might still have the spark of the heroes who voluntarily descend into Hades, but for us he appears as the childish guide we are forced to follow, but never imitate.  \n\nIt's only on the moral spectrum, and almost despite Ladybug, that the movie becomes subtle. With some attentiveness, we can find a sort of comparison between different shades of politeness, an antiquated value but still philosophically powerful in that setup. The Englishmen are up against the Japanese, whose heritage has been stolen by a Russian thug, who can't look at his own heritage. Boys don't look like what they are, girls neither, and Ladybug is unable to deceive anyone. He's the killer who gave up his weapons, who's happe about sedating his foes,  who follows therapy and tries to give therapy... He's a kind of politeness that has no norms, only an empathy, and that's probably why we still like him. Or at least, we're curious to know how his demise would come...\n\nBullet Train revolves around the age old question of the benefits of being evil. It's striking to everyone, at a young age, that being immoral is more lucrative and that people who care the less of their peers do better overall. And if it is truly so, then why be altruistic altogether? Why be less than optimal?.. Why even be \\*polite\\*, as it presents itself in most of our mundane lives? Brad Pitt  is here and he dances with knives and bullets to magically show us how decency prevails in the end. An overly sweet tale for most people but one that has the actual pace of the traditional virtues it aims at depicting, an assumed childishness typically oriental. There's a real conundrum of pace and civilization in this movie that makes it more appropriate to the lovers of Asian culture than to the  action-seeking westerner. It's not that we aren't portrayed nicely, but it's that the movie asks us to exchange with other cultures to be enjoyed as it should. The colors of the cinematography alone won't let you relax once moment: this movie is kawaii, definitely kawaii. There's nothing quite like it that has been done before, afaik, an action movie with a script you could find in a manga, with an over-budgeted production and hollywoodian action scenes. It's an original mix and even though it is difficult for the first viewers right now, there is a possibility that it will age well. The marriage of action movie and asian philosophy has been so iconic in the past, maybe there's room for it in the future.",

It’s shot on low-quality video using a point-and-shoot approach you would expect from a 5th grader. The props and costumes looked as if they were bought at a party store. The whole thing is as ugly as a movie can get. The acting is horrific. A lack of skill or artifice can be fine if you trade it in for something else, but this was just insufferable. \n\nNo doubt it was all intentional. Ken Russell stars in it himself, but I can’t see what he is after. There is nothing edgy or funny or raw about the low production value. He may have wanted to make something that would aggravate his audience, but I’m not sure why. Challenging your audience, or confronting your audience, or expressing anger toward your audience can all be used to accomplish something, but that is not the case here. The film is just a waste of everyone’s time.\n\nThe worst part is the dialogue. Each of the actors puts on a silly voice and a ridiculous accent. After an hour it’s just intolerable. Women’s roles come with the added bonus of being objectified by cheap, revealing costumes and lots of lip licking.\n\nRussell plays a mad psychiatrist with a horrific German accent and a nasal voice. The Doctor runs an insane asylum where he tortures patients with orgies and medical procedures. It could all be some kind of self-parody,  but it shows no insight or irony. The Doctor is treating a rockstar named Usher. Edgar Allan Poe’s work has always been an influence for Russell, but again, the film does not develop the connection or explain anything.\n\nIt was probably liberating to make a film without any concern for quality. I doubt there was much of a crew. It looks like it was filmed in Russell's backyard over the course of a weekend. Russell's last line is “and to sum up…” which he repeats over and over again. He appears unable to explain what he has made, or its purpose, and neither can I.",

        "text": "Raging bull and the wolf of Wall Street are unflattering depiction of Jake LaMotta and Jordan Belfort. In raging bull LaMotta is portrayed as a sexist, domestic abuser who goes as far as starting relationships with teens. He’s a real monster of a man. Belfort is portrayed as an addict. Addicted to women, drugs, money and alcohol. He’s a hedonist who cheats incessantly with both his wives and with his business. Biopics are often flattering depictions. Just this year movies about Elvis and Whitney Houston came out. Both movies were scared to depict the end of their lives that were addled with substance abuse issues. They both aimed to give the best possible interpretation of both people instead of showing what really happened to them. Raging bull and TWOWS are the rare exceptions that show those men as they really were. \n\nThese are autobiographical tales in which both men were involved in the movies making. LaMotta trained De Niro to be a boxer and Belfort is in the movie describing himself as a “bad muthafucka” which leads me to believe that Scorsese is making fun of them. These are men who deserve to be ridiculed they have earned a public embarrassment at the stock. Belfort doesn’t seem to be all that bright outside of his charisma and financial savvy. LaMotta also seems to be a bit of a fool outside of the ring. Which makes me wonder if Scorsese did this to humiliate them while the actual men failed to see it as such?\n\nDo you agree that these movies are meant to flagellate those men or are they just portraying the lives they lead.",

The lighthouse itself, acting as the thing that draws the men to the job, the reward that they crave. The cinematography and lighting are THE best I've seen ever, every shot being its own unique symbol or painting, and it's and damn, crying shame they likely didn't have the budget to buy themselves an Oscar. By God, Chekov could shoot me 17 times in the chest with his gun because there is NO stone left unturned here. One could write college theses on the damned seagulls in this movie.\n\nNow the meaning of the entire film itself? For one, it's wonderful that an entire film itself can be a symbol, but the thing greater than that is it's not symbol. From one angle, you can see that this is the Greek story of Prometheus, quite literally portrayed in the final shot of the film. Though beyond this visual depiction, The Lighthouse being an interpretation of this ancient story seems to be a stretch. Perhaps something to do with Thomas' forbidding nature; once again, a stretch. Though I think my favorite is the 1864 schism of the nihilists.\n\nNow the meaning of the entire film itself?

Now, a lot of movies become my favorite fairly quickly, but I haven't been this massacred by one since Last and First Men, or maybe Eraserhead.",

        "text": "I wish to get a few things out of the way, as to not have anyone confused on my intentions and potential biases. \n\nFirst of all, this topic will discuss religion, a lot, but I really do not wish for this to go off-topic into another debate on whether Christianity is true or not. I'm well aware the users of this site are mainly atheist/agnostic. I also understand that some of you get really irked up when you see \"Christianity\" anywhere, but I implore you to have tolerance this time.\n\nI am a Christian, or at least, I try to be. I'm not from the western world, and I'm not Protestant, I'm not a Roman Catholic, and I don't belong to any small Christian sect, neither am I non-denominational. I am an (Eastern) Orthodox Christian. The Orthodox Christian church and the Catholic church were one Church up until 1054 AD, where differences and crippled relations let to a \"Great Schism\", and as you all know Martin Luther created his own spin-off of Catholicism, as did Henry VIII with Anglicanism. It is like when a glass shatters, and starts breaking more and more. A lot of people in the west do not even know for the Orthodox Church, but it is the second biggest denomination of Christianity after Catholicism.\n\nHistorically speaking, Eastern Orthodox Christians can make the factual claim that they are the unbroken continuation of the Church founded by the Apostles. Jerusalem and the entire \"eastern\" area of Christianity were Eastern Orthodox, until the Muslims (Saracens) conquered most if not all Christian lands that were once Orthodox. The First Crusade started shortly after the Great Schism, and the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Emperor, an empire and emperor who were Orthodox Christians, implored the Pope for help with the Muslim invasions, but under strict terms that the Western Latin Christians were to hold no sway over the historically Orthodox lands. The Latins betrayed this request and set up their own Crusader states in the Palestine area.\n\nNow onto the movie itself.\n\n I'm well aware that Ridley Scott is an agnostic, he makes sure he gets that across in almost every movie, but in some moments you can almost see him playing and thinking about his own beliefs, like the burning bush scene in KoH.\n\nI really like Kingdom of Heaven, because of its settings, and the Director's Cut (Roadshow Version) is framed like those old grand epics of the 50s and 60s, with an overture, intermission, and an entr'acte. The soundtrack is simply amazing, the cinematography and combat scenes feel grand and satisfying. The pacing seems to take a back seat during the latter half of the movie, but this is easily forgivable. \n\nWhere I'm really confused is the philosophical discussions on religion and point of life. Not that I don't understand them, but the views of Balian and some people on these matters are weird for the time period. As others have critiqued the movie, it is a 21st century secular look at a 12th century world, which was entirely religious. Balian with some of his views seems like an average agnostic who just read Kant and Hume, and fell in love with humanism and its \"gotcha\" moments at Western Christianity.\n\nWhat is ironic is that I, as an Eastern Orthodox, am expected to critique Western Christianity because they caused a lot of damage to us, like the Fourth Crusade in 1204, which saw the Catholic Crusaders pillage, loot, and rape the city and inhabitants of what was called the greatest city in the world, Constantinople, oh yeah, this city was also the capital of Eastern Orthodoxy and the Byzantine Empire!\n\nBut I'm not going to spend time critiquing the historical inaccuracies and biased misconceptions of some of these things, that was done a lot by others, I'm also not going to talk about the obvious demonizing of everything and anyone Christian, where Western Christian Europe is shown as a bland and desaturated gutter, where the clergy and other Christians are shown as borderline psychopaths, whereas in the Muslim world, everything is seeping with life and color, and the Muslims are shown in the most opposite way to the Christians, as stoic, faithful, and justified in their doings. Of course no one mentioned the fact the Muslims have been mercilessly killing off Christians in Orthodox lands for five centuries now, because Muhammad decrees it so in the Quran.\n\nBut I'm here merely to discuss a few of the scenes which discuss religion.Ridley Scott stated that Balian is an agnostic because he himself is an agnostic. However, the presence of the Hospitalier knight who is basically an angel contradicts Ridley's apparent goal of making Balian an agnostic.\n\nBalian prays one night, doubting his faith, and then a day later gives up and starts leaning towards agnosticism. This rapid change seems forced and out of place, giving no real worth to the movie, but again, his wife and unborn child died, whilst the clergy of the Western (Catholic) church said various horrid things at the wrong time.\n\nBalian states \"I am outside God's grace\", but the Angel Hospitalier says \"I have not heard that\", alluding that there is a God, and when Balian says he has lost his religion, he gets the following  response: \n\n&gt;**Hospitaller** **:** I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of God. Holiness is in right action and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness. What God desires is here *\\[points to head\\]*  **Hospitaller** **:** and here *\\[points to heart\\]*  **Hospitaller** **:** and what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man - or not.\n\nThis is more or less a weird quote. For such a character to say he puts no \"stock\" in religion, but the latter half is perfect. In fact, in Orthodox theology, you will find saints who say a true Christian should not speak at all, but act like one and by his/her example and there will be no words needed. The scene with the burning bush, where Balian tries to brush off religion and \"Moses\" as simply misunderstood natural happenings, is met with the Angel Hospitalier character appearing out of nowhere, with no horse, in the middle of the desert, behind Balian who arrived there with a horse due to his understandable crisis of faith. \n\n&gt;**Hospitaller** **:** One may stare into the light, until one becomes the light. I've done it many times. **Balian of Ibelin** **:** *\\[throws a rock at a bush that catches fire by the spark\\]*  There's your religion. One spark, a creosote bush. There's your Moses. I did not hear it speak. **Hospitaller** **:** That does not mean that there is no God. Do you love her? **Balian of Ibelin** **:** Yes. **Hospitaller** **:** The heart will mend. Your duty is to the people of the city. I go to pray. **Balian of Ibelin** **:** For what? **Hospitaller** **:** For the strength to endure what is to come. **Balian of Ibelin** **:** And what is to come? **Hospitaller** **:** The reckoning is to come for what was done one hundred years before. The Muslims will never forget. Nor should they. *\\[the Hospitaler slowly walks away as a second bush several yards from the burning one catches fire. The Hospitaler is nowhere to be seen in the clear and open desert\\]* \n\nFirst of all, the Hospitalier has no way of knowing of Balian's love interests, unless...\n\nSecondly the Hospitalier makes it sound like Jerusalem was always a Muslim city, until \"those Crusaders\" came and took what was never theirs. \n\nThis is partially true, in the fact that the city was never \"Catholic\" and the Crusaders did in fact kill a lot of innocent Muslims.The catch here is in the fact that the Muslims killed a lot, A LOT, of innocent Christians, after all the Quran commands them to do it, and JERUSALEM WAS NEVER NEITHER CATHOLIC NOR MUSLIM, it was an Orthodox Christian city where many Orthodox Christians were massacred by the Muslims.\n\nDespite this, the Angel Hospitalier walks off into the desert, Balian turns and sees a completely separate bush catching fire on its own, turning again he sees that in the vast open and empty desert the Hospitalier knight is nowhere to be seen. \n\nIf this is not an allude to \"God exists\" then I do not know what is.\n\nAfter dueling in the desert with a few Crusaders who want him dead by the orders of  Guy of Lusignan, he falls unconscious after killing the attackers. We see the Angel Hospitalier appear again out of nowhere, giving Balian a gentle touch to his forehead, pretty much reviving him, and disappearing again.\n\nDespite these obvious \"God exists\" signs given to Balian, he continues with his critiques on religion in the final act of the film, almost as if he just came off of his reading session of Kant and Russel. The Catholic bishop helps little in the fact he is repeating the same \"God wills it\" while trying to save himself from the Saracen horde outside of Jerusalem. \n\nBalian says how no one and everyone has claim to the Holy Sites and Jerusalem itself, saying basically that Jerusalem belongs to all people, the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims, and how not one of those groups has the right to claim it their own. Balian later tells the bishop \"you have taught me a lot about religion\". As if the Angel Hospitalier did not do anything????\n\nIn burning the dead bodies which are deceased by plague, Balian says to the bishop. \"If he is God, he will undestand, if he does not understand, then he is not God, and we need not worry\". Oh how simple, if God does not agree with what I'm doing, he is not God, and there is no God. This attitude is short-sighted and confusing. I'm not saying anything on what should have been done to the bodies themselves.\n\nNear the end, Balian threatens Salah Al-Din (Saladin) that if he does not grant the inhabitants of Jerusalem safe passage out, he (Balian) will personally see to it that every single Holy Place in Jerusalem is torn down and desecrated, because those places \"drive men mad\".\n\nBalian is shown to go above religions and gods, and makes a threat to both Muslims and Christians alike. At the end of the movie, a Muslim character says to Balian \"If God does not love you, how could you have done the things you have done\".\n\nI watched the movie a few days ago and still think about it. It is very thought provoking and I really liked the movie, even though the ambiguous and forced approach to religion and the pandering to Islam and Humanism is noticeable, I still feel a sort of attachment to the movie. I wish we had more of these traditional 3-4 hour historical epics.\n\nMy final question is, does God even exist in KoH? And does Balian believe in him? Does God exist but Balian chooses a more agnostic approach?\n\nThank you for reading this long wall of text, and if you didn't, thank you for taking the time to click on it.\n\n*In the words of the Angel Hospitalier himself,* ***God bless you.***",

        "text": "I recently stumbled upon a book about Alice Guy-Blaché and was astonished that it was the first time I heard of her.Not only was she the first woman filmmaker, but a visionary and a true pioneer of the early days of cinema. So, if you are like me and not familiar with her incredible accomplishments, I made a [video essay](https://youtu.be/3rVQI-PNwTg) about her life and career, but if you prefer to read - here is the most important parts in text.In 1895 she had just started working as a secretary for the French inventor and engineer Léon Gaumont.\nIt was an exciting time of innovation, and motion pictures, although very basic, were showing signs of being the next big thing.\nKnowing that, manufacturers from all over the world, including Gaumont, were competing with each other to create the best version of a motion picture camera, \nand perhaps even more importantly, a reliable way for the images to be projected on a big screen.\n\nThe ones who did it first were the Lumière brothers, and on December 28, 1895, they would make history by conducting the first public screening of motion pictures for a paying audience. Unsurprisingly, this new attraction was a massive hit, and not before long Léon Gaumont would begin to manufacture his own camera system as well.\n\nThe main purpose of films in those early days was to essentially document everyday life. They were called actualities, and were nothing more than just a simple shot of something mundane happening—a train arriving at a station, workers leaving a factory, a city street... you get the idea. They were essentially seen as a scientific and documentation tool. To Alice Guy-Blaché however, the potential was far beyond just that.\nBeing the daughter of a bookseller, she had been surrounded by books her entire life. So one day, as she puts it, she gathered some courage and asked Gaumont if she could try to film a scene on her own—a fictional one. Just like in the books she had been reading growing up.\nApparently, he told her that it seems like a silly thing to do,  but as long as it wouldn’t interfere with her regular job as a secretary, she could go ahead and give it a try.\n\nAnd so she did.\nShe grabbed some friends and a camera, and the result was The Cabbage Fairy (1896), a simple story about a young couple who wants to have a baby. \nThe film turned out to be a huge success, and Léon Gaumont was so pleased with it that he decided to enter the movie-making business. To help him with that he appointed Alice Guy as the Head of Production, making her one of the earliest prominent figures in this completely new industry.\n\nOver the following decade, as a writer and director, she was involved in the making of hundreds of movies for the company, and at the same time as the head of production—she supervised the entirety of the film output.\n\nIt wasn’t just a fancy title either. When was actually involved in every single stage of the process, from personally hiring and training new directors, to managing set designers, scouting locations, finding props, and even making some of the costumes herself.\nIn 1900 she won her first award for her work, and by 1905 she had directed more than 100 movies using the chronophone—a system that Gaumont had developed for synchronising picture with sound.\nIn addition to that, she was among some of the first directors to experiment with a variety of filmmaking techniques—from visual effects to close-ups, reverse speed, and hand-tinted color to name a few.\n\nIn 1906 after continuous success, she took on her biggest project to date—a 25-part film about the life and passion of Christ.\nBy all means, it was going to be a challenge. A massive production, big budget, multiple locations, over 300 extras, special effects, and many advanced storytelling techniques.\nBut if anyone could make it happen, it was going to be her. Once again, it was successful. And when it was projected at the “Society for the Development of the National Industry” in Paris, each scene was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.\n\nThe next chapter of her life takes her to the United States.\nShe had just married, and moved across the ocean with her husband Herbert Blaché, a production manager for Gaumont whose job over there was to promote the chronophone in that region.\nUnfortunately, this venture failed, and the studio Gaumont had built for that purpose was getting underutilised, but what Alice Guy-Blaché saw was opportunity.\nSo, she rented a part of it and started making films on her own under the umbrella of the Solax Company—making her the first woman to be running a studio.\n\nIt was a joint business venture with her husband, and while he was taking care of the production side of things, she was the one directing the films.\nWithin two years Solax became a major player in the industry, and as the demand was increasing, Alice Guy-Blaché invested in a state-of-the-art studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, right next to Universal and the rest of the American film giants.\nNewspapers were widely reporting on her success, calling her a dominant figure in the motion picture industry. But even though she was now a businesswoman, she was always a film director first. She kept on improving her storytelling skills and there were a lot of things that made her movies special.\n\nFor one, they were about life. The acting was a lot less theatrical than the norm at the time. She focused on real human emotions and that was so important to her that she had a sign in her studio that read “Be Natural”—as that is all she wanted from her actors.\n\nBut what's even more is that she was willing to go against the grain. She had women play important and empowering characters. She was the first one to have an all-African-American cast. From gender inequality to antisemitism and human rights, her movies challenged social norms—and her female perspective was not only present, but very much needed.\n\nMy favorite film from her filmography is Falling Leaves (1912) and would love to hear yours!",

Griffith became the emperor Los Angeles for the picture, creating a  veritable city of 300-ft-tall Judean walls and elephant idols, hiring  over 3,000 painstakingly outfitted biblical extras to populate his  pop-up paradise on an otherwise sleepy Sunset Boulevard. Why? Because at  his core, Griffith was a seedy character. In many ways, *Intolerance* was  his manic, ego-fuelled quest for public forgiveness and greatness. This  was the sizzling beginning of big budget pictures, and it was built on a  foundation of scandal, glamour, and disaster. It wasn’t just a movie.

        "text": "Some thoughts on this intriguing movie...I find some parts hard to watch just because of the sheer pretentious eruditeness, albeit this is done on purpose. Nevertheless, I like the concept of the movie and I'd recommend this movie to anyone interested in films. I do have many comments on the realism on the movie which is something that the filmmakers were obviously going for.\n\n1) Blanchett's conducting gestures is a bit off...I can't put my hand on it but it just looks like an untrained professional conducting. However, her verbal instruction does seem like what a top-tier english-speaking conductor would say to a professional orchestra. Kudos to the script-writer and/or music consultant to this movie.\n\n2) Blanchett's German is pretty good, and she nailed down the German accent. My only gripe is that her German lines are too obviously scripted. Since you can tell that she's not a native speaker of German, she shouldn't be able to fire those lines with such fluidity. I think if she appear to stumble more on her German, it would've been perfect. \n\n3) Unrealistic that a LBGTQ+ conductor who have a history of sexual scandals will be appointed to an orchestra like Berlin Phil. German orchestra allows their own musicians to elect their own chief conductor. The election process is highly competitive and there's a kind of conservatism to it. Someone as bombastic and controversial as Tar is unlikely to get the job despite her talent.\n\nStudying under Leonard Bernstein wouldn't give Tar an advantage in the election process too. Bernstein had lots of students and only a small percentage of them made it as truly world-class. Moreover, there are relatively few American-born conductors in top-tier conducting. \n\n4) Too much rehearsal time for Mahler 5. Professional orchestra do not devote so much time to practice a single piece, even for a recording. \n\n5) Backstage Trumpet Solo is also not realistic. Mahler, the composer, is famous for pedantic instruction in the conductor's score. I don't think a professional orchestra is going to put the solo backstage.\n\nSome thoughts on the movie itself:\n\n6) Although I highlighted the unlikelihood of someone like Tar getting elected as Chief Conductor of Berlin Phil, I must say this 'inversion' is refreshing. To see someone as cunning and controversial like Tar at this coveted position is sardonic of the musical scene. I suspect that the screenwriters secretly detest this industry (ironically, musicians will hate to be labelled as an industry).\n\n7) Another point on 'inversion' - now we have a female lead who is engaging in all the cardinal sins you can think of: bullying, being a sexual predator, having a relationship with a subordinate (concertmaster) in a complex workplace dynamic, aggressively anti-woke. I find this amusing which is why I bothered to finish the movie.\n\n8) I was expecting Tar to begin a sexual relationship, or sexually assault Olga for a more villainous development. \n\n9) PTSD-like symptoms were portrayed brilliantly. \n\n10) I love the triangulation of all her relationships. Nothing is simple in her life. Even her relationship with her brother is fraught. \n\nOverall, the movie is refreshing for the points I have mentioned. Few movies revolving orchestras are made, ostensibly due to the relatability of the musical life. The target audience is obviously not the everyday man. The producers are also not going for the box office $, but gunning for awards.",
