I bet someone died over there.\" I looked at her confused and quickly replied \"Uh yeah maybe.\" and rushed inside only to find a man walking his cat up and down the stairs inside the apartment building. Not being able to reach the person who ordered the pizza he opens the door and asks if I know which room to go to. I tell him yes then rush up to the room and quickly leave. Luckily I left without being the next one in the hearse.",

They paid in advance and left a $25 tip, and we found out right before we left to deliver the order. We pumped those pizzas out as fast as we could this morning, and got to the place at 12:30. We had 3 people (including myself) go to unload the truck. They didn't hold the door for us, help us unload, *or even say thank you*... We got all of the pizzas indoors and they had the audacity to ask us to hand out pizza to everyone, we said no and left (still no thank you at all). Pretty shitty, but I still got $10 (my boss just rounded it up to make it even) so I guess it could've been worse. But still....",

When I tell her I'm in front of her house, she begins to berate me on the phone telling me how I'm not and how I *need* to hurry up and get her hangry-ass her pizza. I apologize for my mistake, entering the address for a house several doors down (I use voice-to-text with Google Maps, sometimes shit happens).\n\nAs I walk up to the door, she starts swearing and cursing at me, telling me that I'm an idiot and that my pizza place should hire some smarter drivers (what you don't know, lady, is that I'm a member of Phi Beta Kappa, thank you very much). Her son walks into the living room to see what's going on and why his mom is so upset. She looks at the two of us and says something to her son like, 'Just sign the fucking receipt and don't leave a tip.' She storms out of the room while I explain the situation to her son. He sighs, and looks at the receipt again, scratches the total out, and hands it back to me with a $7 tip. He didn't apologize but the look on his face told me this was unfortunately a pretty regular occurrence.\n\ntl;dr Sometimes I make mistakes; it's not personal. A woman tested my patience and by not reacting ended up getting a great tip.",

I knock on the door on the left a few times and there is no answer. My phone is on the charger in my car, so I go back and call the customer. He answers and I tell him I knocked on the back left door and there was no answer. He says, \"Well I've been by the door the entire time so you didn't knock on shit. I'll be right out.\" I can already tell this guy is gonna be a pain in the ass.\n\nSo I go back behind the house and he comes out of the door on the right. As I hand the pizza to him, I tell him, \"Sorry, it said to go to the back left door.\"\n\nHe says, \"This is the left unit.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but it said back left door.\"\n\nHe drops the pizza down on his patio table and hold up two hands while facing me. He starts talking to me like he's scolding a kindergartner. \"If you're facing the building, which door is on the left?\"\n\nI hold up my left hand and point at the door on the left. Now he starts shouting at me. \"If you're facing the FUCKING BUILDING, which unit is on the left?\"\n\nI hold up my left hand and say, \"Left.\" I hold up my right hand and point at his door and say, \"Right.\"\n\n\"I said go to the FUCKING door on the left with the FUCKING light. Does that door have a light?\"\n\nI look at the door on my left and the light above it and say, \"Yes...\"\n\n\"That's a FUCKING motion light that YOU must have set off. MY light is ALWAYS on!\"\n\n\"Sorry, it said back left door with light. That's where I went.\"\n\n\"Well I don't know how my instructions could have been any more clear. You just must be stupid.\"\n\nAt first I was shocked, then my shock quickly turned to anger. I hold the credit card slip out and say, \"Sign this.\"\n\nHe signs it and I walk back to my car in a huff. I drive back to the store and tell the manager what he said and the manager can't believe it.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, we get a notification of poor customer feedback online. It's Mr. Back Left Door. He writes, \"I gave very clear instructions on where to go, and yet you have to call for directions every time. Maybe you should hire smarter drivers.\" Upon seeing that, I told the manager I refuse to ever deliver to his house again.\n\nI brought it up to another driver and she went off on how rude he was to her as well. She told me that it went pretty much the same way and that he was just as rude to her, telling her that \"if she was smart enough to follow his 'clear' instructions, she would have a 'real job'\".\n\nI wonder where people get off thinking they can get away with treating service people like dirt.",

So I show up and knock on the door, a man answers and says the guy who ordered is upstairs sleeping and I can come in. \n\nSo I go upstairs and there is a very fat native guy with no shirt sleeping in a room. So I ask the other guy if he would mind waking his buddy up, he tells me no and then he goes downstairs gets in a car and drives off. \n\nSo there I am standing in a house alone with a fat snoring native and fifty dollars worth of pizza. \n\nSo I start knocking on his open bedroom door, he doesn't wake up.\n\nSo I start banging on his wall and shouting wake up, he doesn't wake up. \n\nThen I notice a broken nerf shot gun beside his bed and I'm not about to touch this greasy looking man with my hands so I pick up the nerf gun and start hitting him with it, he doesn't wake up. \n\nSo now I'm whacking this guy with a nerf gun shouting \"WAKE UP! WAKE UP AND TAKE YOUR PIZZA! \"\n\nFinally he shouts \"FUCK OFF\" and I go \"NO WAKE UP AND GIVE ME MY MONEY\" He shouts \"FUCK OFF IM TIRED\". So I say, \"fine then I'm going to leave and take your pizza with me\" \n\nFinally he wakes up, walks into the kitchen and pays for the food along with a five dollar tip. So I leave that stupid house after being in that stupid situation and just shake my head at my new worst delivery. \n\nEdit: yeah most of you make a pretty good point that what I did was fairly stupid  but I live in a fairly small town and I'm a pretty big guy, I honestly wasn't that worried about it. Also in hindsight maybe I should have just left but in the moment I had a fifty dollar order and the customer right in front of me it's hard to explain leaving to the boss\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So, this isn’t one of those “A guy tipped me 700 dollars!” kind of stories (because that never really happens) It’s more subtle, but I still wanted to put it up here, because everybody needs to understand the impact of human decency. \n\nSo, it had been a long day and I'm more tired then usual. I had a pounding headache and the deliveries keep coming in. I was in a terrible mood when I left the store.\nNow, this address isn't new to our system, but I've never delivered to it. It's in a wealthy neighborhood, which is actually the worst. Upper-middle class people tend to be the worst tippers on the planet.\n\nAnyway, I get there and knock on the door.\n\nLet me set the scene here-\nThe girl who opens the door can't be older then 15 or 16. She's in a wheelchair, wearing a dark grey tee shirt and black leggings, sporting a buzzcut. Makeup isn't gothic or punk per se, but  definitely edgy (dark eye shadow, black lips). It's the look that if I tried to pull off in highschool, it'd be a disaster. \nIrregardless, I'm pretty sure she'd deck anybody who tried to fuck with her- disabled or not.\nShe's obviously home alone, which, [side note here,] I always hate seeing teenagers home alone ordering pizzas for themselves on weekends (or in this case, over summer break.) I always feel like they should be with friends or eating as a family. Maybe it's because I was the only child with no friends and working parents who ate delivery alone every night growing up, but it always makes me sad to see. \n\nAlright back on track with the story now...\nI hand her the receipt to sign and she hands me 10 bucks. \n\"10 bucks?\" It's a 15$ bill you know.\"\nwhy I didn't ask how much she wanted in change I have no idea, but I consider a good tip 3 bucks, 5 tops, so this was a surprise.\n\n\"Yeah, I know, but you're quite literally feeding me. I get the sense most people don't really appreciate that.\"\n\nThat blew me away. I know some of you have gotten way more in tips, but remember, this order was 1 small pizza, no toppings. Not a holiday, good weather. 2 dollars would have sufficed.\nSo now I'm happier then when I arrived, but I feel like shit. I hand her the pizza and am trying to put money in my pocket, while closing the insulated bag thing when I stumble over my own feet and drop everything. I sorta trip on the way down, too. Mortified, I start scrambling to get everything picked up.\n\n\"You ok?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah I'm good. Just a headache.\"\nI immediately want to shoot myself. Why did I say i have a headache? Why not just leave? Part of me tries to rationalize.\nI'm flailing around while squeezing my upper nose. It's not like she doesn't know somethings wrong.\n\n\"One sec.\"\n\nI can't express how much I really didn't want to stand there any longer. at this point i have one hand massaging my temple. I'm dying. Without breaking eye contact, she reaches back, fumbles around with a backpack hanging from the back of her wheelchair, and then hands me a bottle of Advil.\nI must've looked shocked, because she immediately says\n\n\"Seriously. Don't worry. I have more in the house. It's all yours.\"\n\nNow, I realize how bizarre this whole situation was, and I realize how dangerous it could have been. I'm not in the habit of accepting drugs from strangers, but this girl really, really, didn't seem like the type to pass off MDMA as Advil, and I was desperate. \nI poured out four tablets and swallowed them right there, then gave the bottle back to her.\n\n\"Thank you!\"\n\n\"Not a problem. Drive safely.\"\n\nSo yeah, that's my story. I know it's kinda subtle, but i am so grateful to that girl that I'm sitting in my car typing this up right now, in the middle of my shift. It was a nice change from entitled assholes who ignore you or the single, drunk guys who hit on me.",

I had been getting awful customers all night, but this one takes the cake.\n\nI pull up to the apartment and walk up two flights of stairs to his door. I knock and he answers. He's completely naked. I decide not to give him the satisfaction of acknowledging it and just treat it like a normal delivery. He's of course snickering and trying to make it a bigger deal than I was acknowledging so he says \"Sorry, we're having a bit of a party in here.\" His apartment was pitch black and silent. I walk back to my car and notice he took my pen. I'm sure as hell not going back for it. Hey, he tipped me $2.\n\nLater that night, we get a phone call. It was a customer complaining that the wings he ordered cut his mouth open and he wants another order for free. We ring him up some boneless and he says \"No, I want traditional.\" Like the ones that cut your mouth open? Whatever. I was next up so I had to take the free order. I look at the address and realize it was a customer I delivered to early in the night. And then it hit me. Yep, it was the naked guy. And yes, he was naked the second time too. Still no reaction from me.",

I end up ordering pizza on many (6 or7+ times in 2 weeks) of those nights.  I have been reading through this sub and hear about drivers having/knowing regulars and such.  I always order from the same place (PJ's) and have never had the same driver - ever (not a large town).  Do you people tell each other who tips well and who does not?  I usually order a large pizza and 1 side (wings or poppers) and tip 6$ on a $25~ order (is that fair)? or does that get me on the naughty list? or on the nice list? or the unforgettable list? I should add that I raid my change jar so the 6$ is in quarters or dollar/2 dollar coins and not bills if that makes any difference and pay for the food with credit/debit.\n\n\nI appreciate your job and do not want to be a cheapskate, I am just surprised I never see the same person twice, and would like to know how your (nice person/naughty lists - if the even exist - work).\n\n\nedit... And the other night I ordered and put instructions on the order to come to the back door as our TV room is downstairs and I can not hear the doorbell but can usually hear people walking up the stairs in the back.  I did not hear him (was watching a loud show) and he needed to call from his cell to tell me he was there.  Will this put me on the naughty list?",

        "text": "I’ve only been a delivery driver for a couple of months and this is the first incident where I’ve had something sketchy go on so I’m equal parts pleased I realized what was happening and disappointed that I could have fucked up with someone trying to pull something over on me.\n\n&gt; **A Little Introductory Information**: There’s a group of apartments that are near our restaurant that a particular problem customer lives in. You probably know of the type: the customer that will use the restaurants good will to their advantage by claiming that something, anything was wrong with their delivery in order to get free shit out of it. “It’s overcooked, I’d like a new one delivered”, “There’s mushrooms on this pizza, I’d like a new one delivered”, etc.\n\nSo yesterday an order comes in and right away I notice that this is the street that this customer lives on. I haven’t been around long enough to have the specific address memorized but I’ve heard the stories from the other drivers and so I get hyper vigilant about this order. Everything is checked and double checked. The ticket is correct and the pizza looks good: correct toppings, not burnt in any sense of the word, and cut nicely. I set out and get to the address on the ticket only to realize that it’s not the troublemaker but a neighbor across the parking lot. I breathe a sigh of relief that I don’t have to deal with them this time and knock on the door.\n\nA man answers the door and I tell him the price of the pizza ($23.5-something) and he hands me a twenty and a one and says that his wife is getting the rest. This happens sometimes and I can hear his wife in the background rummaging around in her purse, so I start to hand him our delivery bag and as I’m doing so he asks me if I have change. We do carry change and so I tell him “Yes” and he asks for a five.\n\nLooking back on it I know it was a stupid move, but at the time but I was just relieved I didn’t have to deal with our problem customer. So I pull a five out of my change bag and hand it to him while I’m busy getting the pizza out of our warming bag. Simultaneously while this is happening his wife hands him a ten. I hand him his pizza and he hands me a five.\n\nFor a split second I think that this is fine. $26 is greater than $23.5-something and I get a $2 tip, right? Then I realize what happened. I believe what I said was “Have a nice- Wait. No.” I tell the guy that I need more money and he replies with “Isn’t that your tip?” I explain that the pizza cost $23.50, he gave me $21.00, and I just gave him $5.00 from my own change. I need the $10.00 he’s holding and he can have the $5.00 back. He kind of looks at me blankly for a second and his wife (who had gone back to sit down on the couch) asks him if there’s anything wrong. He hands me the ten and I return the five to him. As he closes the door I can hear him tell her that “Nothing’s wrong, just a little confusion.”",

Apparently I was one of the 11 ppl that called in about these guys, uniforms were already on the way to the trail. Though, they couldn't find them dudes when they took my dmg report an hour later^duh. \n\nThe deputy was pretty nice, didn't bother to call out how I was driving without my wallet (which was forgotten at home and contains my drivers licence). The bros at store had a good laugh; now I know whose house I should goto at the first sign of the zombie apocalypse, and so ends my saturday~\n\nTLDR; $2 tip for my troubles, fml.",

        "text": "I am a manager who sometimes drives for one of the big 3.  Anyone who also works for this one will know exactly which it is but here goes anyway. Recently, they have a new system on the website for all online orders that a customer can pay an extra couple (like $2-3 I think) to get their order as a priority order. This order then gets sent to the top of the makeline and delivery list.  Even if you have orders at high times, the priority order HAS to be delivered first, and the system will not let you skip it, and requires a manager's password to add on another delivery.  I have had problems in the past where there have been deliveries on the board that need to go immediately, on the brink of being late and then have to skip over it because someone paid three bucks to get theirs sooner.  I mean you can't tell another customer who calls to complain that their pizza isn't there because someone paid three dollars to make sure their delivery more important than yours.  If a customer tips well, a driver remembers it.  If you don't they also remember it.  Throwing a couple dollars at a website to get your order out of order is abhorrent in my mind.  Throwing those same dollars at the drivers whom delivered to you previously would most likely have the same effect.  \n\nWhat do you, a sub full of delivery drivers think about this system?  Do you think this is a helpful system for people who want their delivery quicker, and aren't afraid to pay more for it? ",

You wouldn't be able to tell them from any other car on the road.\n\nIt's beginning to make me think, what are the pros and cons of using a pizza topper? The only pros I can think of is that it's brand awareness and if you light it up, you can find it easy if you park it in a lot somewhere. But I can think of more cons than good with them. They're less aerodynamic, they can advertise the fact you're carrying food/money to potential robbers, it scratches up your roof, and if you believe cops give leniency to people with pizza signs for speeding a bit over the limit like I've been told, they won't if you don't have a sign up there.\n\nBut despite those I'd like to hear your thoughts on the topic aswell.",

He's incredibly temperamental, has horrible judgment, and does things every single goddamn day that would get you fired in a heartbeat at any other company. We're a chain that's mostly local, with a few locations. This guy is, when he has his head on right, a really great boss. Problem is that his head isn't on right 99% of the time, and add lots of drugs and alcohol into the mix, and he is a doozy to work for, to say the least. But it's entertaining and funny when it's not unbridled rage being hurled at you for absolutely no reason.\n\n\nA couple of months ago, one of our drivers, Ronnie, who was a long time employee, had some issues at work. I don't 100% know the specifics, but he had some anger issues and did coke for a while. He never really had any difficulties when I worked with him, but adding my DM into the mix was like kicking a hornet's nest. \n\n\nThe two began arguing over something- I don't know, some run that my DM didn't like, but Ronnie thought was fine. Anyway, the important thing is that Ronnie and the DM began bickering, and it suddenly got really fucking heated, really fast. Ronnie stormed off to the other side of the kitchen, where we have the dishwashing sink and the dish machine, and fucking PUNCHED IT as hard as he could. He honest-to-god left a dent in the side of it. \n\n\nOf course, my DM was furious, and began screaming at Ronnie, things like \"DON'T YOU FUCKING TRASH MY STORE- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I DENTED YOUR CAR?!\". As he was shouting this, my DM walked over, grabbed the nearest fire extinguisher, and stormed outside. Sadly, this is the last of the camera footage before I had to piece together the rest of the story from the other drivers and employees working that shift. \n\n\nMy DM rushed outside with the fire extinguisher, and held it above Ronnie's windshield, and demanded that he apologize. Ronnie was adamant that my DM was in the wrong, etc, etc etc. Basically throwing gasoline on the fire at this point. I think at some point several of the bigger guys working for us had to go out there a break up this fight between this grown-ass professional restaurant manager and this 18 year old kid. \n\n\nSadly, or maybe not, I did not get to witness this fight, but that's okay, because not too long after, two of my drivers got into a knock-down drag-out brawl that ended with one of them choking the other out during the middle of the night rush. Neither of them was fired. \n\n\nFun times are always had at my work. I could write a book of all the insane shit my DM has done.",

I do know several of my coworkers who frequent this subreddit and I'm sure this story will stick out very easily, but alas here it goes anyway.\n\nWe hired an interesting guy about a month ago. He had his moments where he was a good worker, but at other times he would be a total shitbag and take other people's deliveries or just simply leave once he had been cashed out (when he had the closing shift.) \n\nHe called up one day and said that he was getting \"his tires rotated\" and could not come in immediately, but would be in soon. He was supposed to come in at four and had not showed up by 7, so the manager calls him and tells him not to come in as it would be largely pointless since it was a relatively slow day. \n\nThe guy comes in the next day and says, \"Hey you see my new rims on my car?\" The realization that he made someone else close because he was getting new rims on his car made me angry, but I'm not one to really complain to the owner so I let it go.\n\nA couple of days pass and he doesn't come in for another shift. The manager calls him up and asks him if he's coming in. The coworker says that he cannot come in because his rims got stolen. His car was sitting on cinder blocks because they either got stolen or repo'd. I wonder which one...\n\nHe was fired shortly thereafter because he no showed no called several more times. ",

        "text": " (Sorry for lack of formatting)\n\n   I'm a driver (F) who has been PT for over a year now for one of the big 3, I make up to $20 PH on game nights so I like having this job. \n\n   We have taken on a new employee over the past 6 weeks who is related to MGMT. He's a little \"different\" and I understand that and try to help out if I notice him getting behind or making mistakes. \n\n   I'm kind of a motherly type (I have a BF  in a long term relationship, I do *not* flirt but I am nice to everyone) so I will often pickup a manager coffee or food on the way back if they're doing open till close. \n    Over the past 3 weeks, this employee has started to touch me (Not like a pat on the back, but squeezing, poking, trying to give back massages.. \"accidentally\" brushing against me, holding my wrists etc) I understand the store is small and accidents can happen, but when it's constant and lingering it's not an accident. \n\n  It's progressed to taking my keys and phone (repeatedly) hiding things I need to do my job and conveniently finding them again, following me around the store and asking if he can meet me somewhere. Most recently he's tried to get in my car, saying it's \"Our car\", and sat on it,refusing to get off, saying he's going to follow me home or wants to come home with me when I try to leave and blocking me.\n\n  I finally had enough after repeatedly telling him to stop and I had a BF etc, and was trying to work.. So I brought it up to management, who promptly wrote him up for sexual harassment as I had asked for a transfer to another store. \n  After this happened, he was throwing stuff, slamming things and glaring at me all night. Mgmt (even though they are related) told me he was going to be gone if he did this again. I'm afraid he's going to retaliate and do something to my car, or follow me home (I don't live far from store).  I don't want him to lose his job as it's kinda hard for him to be employed and this is an opportunity for him. \n\n   At the same time, I'm scared he's going to do something else, I'm absolutely NOT comfortable being alone in the back of the store with him. My request for transfer was denied and I'm stuck being on the same shift with him right now as we're short.  I need this job right now, as the company I regularly worked for just went under,  but am worried about what he might do :( \n\n  Any advice?  I kinda want to escalate it as I don't think it's going to stop, but my manager assured me it would. Do not want to go back there tonight :(\n\n**Update**:  (not sure how to do an update post and link it.. ) Thanks for all the advice, and duly noted. I did go in last night, against my BF's wishes (he wants me to quit as he hates me doing this job, but it's not feasible right now). The person in question wasn't there. Apparently the report was escalated by my manager and it was decided that it was best we weren't on the same shift for now, I'm not sure-the guy may be suspended, they just told me not to worry and that my comfort and safety were most important. I think everything has been caught on the CCTV except the incidents with my car. \n\n   I really do love this job (I know it sounds silly- it's just delivery,but it's great to interact with the customers and- for the most part- co workers) and the MGMT knows I work hard and care about the store. \nIf anyone else is experiencing this, and you tell the person to \"STOP\" or \"I'm NOT playing.. this isn't funny stop\" repeatedly and they do not, you have every right to report it to management. You should NOT (as I did) have to move constantly to other parts of the store to avoid this person, or think about calling in sick and losing pay because you don't want to be on the same shift as them. You should also make a note of the time, date and what happened when it happens (I know you can get busy quickly, but if you don't note it then then times can become sketchy). It doesn't matter if your M or F, and because you work in the service industry, you are not less of a human being than anyone else.\n\n   ",

It's late and nearing Christmas so my SO and I decided to take our kid through the Christmas light show set up through the park. Right as we get in I get a call from my shift supervisor. She tells me some guy ordered his pizza and when he came to pick it up it was wrong. The guy literally flips out and starts cussing at them and threatening to burn the place down. I told her if she was seriously afraid for her safety to call the cops while I call the DM to give them a heads up. We agree the guy is prolly just crazy but not serious. We were wrong.\n\n10 minutes pass and we are only halfway through the park. They go all out with this and people are cruising and stopping to admire every display. My phone rings again and my employee is in tears. According to her there was a knock on the window outside and the guy was standing there with a red tank of gasoline. Cops still hadn't showed up (they were awful in this town, I unfortunately had to call them a lot. More stories on that later) he then walked to the side of the building and that was the last we saw of him. I'm stuck in this stupid line literally only 5 minutes away from my store but no one is budging. I call the DM again and she can't believe he actually came back. Finally I get to the store and cops are everywhere. Checking all the cars, they stopped a man walking his dog for questions but they never found the guy. Never heard anything else. I've had threats and such before but this was a whole level of crazy. ",

Usually pretty routine, in and out and back to my car. So I left my car running in the street and knock on the door. While waiting for the lady I got distracted by her cat laying on the top of the hand rail on her mini porch. I hear a door shut and turn around to see a woman getting in my car! There was a car behind my car too which I believe was in on it.  I dropped everything and went chasing after my car. Got close and ended up falling on the concrete. They drove off. I had no chance. \nI had both my wallet with $180 cash from my last two days working, my phone, and an older iPod touch in the car. \n\nSo my fellow drivers. Be careful. Always lock your car when you go to the door, even if it's less than 15 feet away. Keep your cash out of your car. and NEVER think it won't happen to you. Because I did.

Night shifts, however, still averages about 21 dollars, even though business has been slower lately. Seeing my lazy-ass co-worker driver get all night shifts makes me feel less valued.. Sometimes I wonder if i got recognized as being an exceptional team member for my actual hard work, or for the fact that I'm willing to open three days when no one else is, even though night shift drivers make more in tips.\n\nIf it were up to me, i'd work nights only. But I don't want to offend management. The thing is, no one wants to take the opening shift. and they also need more night drivers because one or two are quitting soon. So I'm afraid if i let them know that i dont want to open anymore because business has been slow, they will get offended and maybe hold it against me? What do you guys think? My friend told me to just lie and say im signing up for school in day time lol. But honestly, I dont like lying. What should I do in my position?",

        "text": "This was at Chinese food take-out. It was the end of shift after staying late due to a very busy dinner. The drivers had gone home and it was me and another counter person doing our closing duties. \n\nMaybe 10 minutes before we're completely closed we get a call from Customer. He wants Chinese, and he wants it bad. So my boss does the usual by this point and says it's basically up to me if he gets food or not, because I'd be taking it. Sure, I'm usually up for gettin' an extra couple bucks. So boss lady okays it but it's gonna be a 7$ delivery charge because this guy was technically in another city. He was like 10 miles away, it was crazy.\n\nSidebar: We usually did free delivery depending on how far you were. We had a decent sized area where the furthest outskirts in our area was a 3$ charge. It goes to us drivers as a supplement to the tip, CFP gets none of it. Sadly plenty of people took that as, 'well that's your tip'. Dicks.\n\nAnyway, back to story: \n\nHe places his order and it comes out to about $18, that's including the delivery charge. I look up where he is on the map, and this dude is far.\n\nHe lives out in a subrural part of the outskirts of the City where the really fuckin' rich live. The 1 to 5 million dollar houses. I take manicured dirt roads to get to the actual house after I enter the fucking rich neighborhood and see a big damn house with like a 5 car garage and a few sports cars out front.\n\nThis is where it gets good. Ring the doorbell, customer answers, and I really can't believe what I'm seeing. I know what I'm seeing, but this shit is supposed to happen in 80's movies about rich dudes, right? Nobody would *actually* snort cocaine off a lady's ass right?\n\nLoL, no. Dumbass kid me. Literal chubby cheeked boy scout.\n\nCustomer is wearing an untied red silk kimono, and that's it. He has a couple of pretty women standing next to him wearing not much more, and there's the Gordon Gekko scene happening behind him in his cavernous living room.\n\nDelivery pleasantries exchanged, this dude is way happy about every goddamn thing. He's super grateful for the food (now that I think about it, our food was fucking awesome, it must have tasted like God high on cocaine). Time to pay.\n\nAt this point, I'm happy to get the 7$ delivery charge because I'm not gonna spend half that in gas, so I'm already set for bein' totally fine. He walks away for a minute (which is when I see the vigorous butt sniffing goin' on in the back) and comes back with a couple bills.\n\nCool, twenty bucks. i get a 8-9$ tip! Best I've ever had (since I've barely delivered at this point). \n\n&gt;Me: \"Hey thanks, I have a good n--\"\n\nWait, no...\n\nThose aren't tens.\n\n&gt;Me: \"Wait I think you gave me the wrong--\"\n\n&gt;DiCaprio: \"I know.\" as he slowly closes the [12 foot asgardian door.] (http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/legacy/i/partypictures/07_08_14/boh/Untitled-3.jpg)\n\nI just kinda stood there for a second thinkin'...do I tell my boss? What if I go to work tomorrow and he's pissed off thinkin' I stole from him? I figured I'll just hold onto it for a week [in case he changes his mind] (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EE3wT5fSFvM/UI7JTn7kXuI/AAAAAAAAB0A/NBuKSPuyDEE/s1600/up_russell1.jpg)\n\nA week went by with no calls or anythin'. That's how I got tipped $188 on an 11ish$ order.\n\nTL;DR: 1,710% tip if you count the delivery charge.",

The front desk staff harass our drivers, we're not allowed to go to the rooms, and most of the people who stay there are assholes. \n\nSo a web order comes in for said hotel, the total came to be about 30 dollars with a super generous $2 tip (which happened to be the lowest tip I'd gotten all night). After waiting for another order heading that way I approach the hotel and call the customer down to the lobby. He replies \"Perfect, I'll be down in a minute,\" sounding happy as can be.\n\nOnce he meets me in the lobby he has a nasty face, the only way I can think to describe it is that he smelled something bad. Anyway, once I hand him the receipt to sign he scribbles \"DRIVER DID NOT COME TO ROOM, REMOVE TIP\". I kind of chuckled and handed him his order. \n\nI moved onto my next delivery which was a super chill stoner who happily gave me $8 on one pizza.\n\nOnce I got back to the store the manager was asking me what was up \"that hotel guy's ass\". Once I told him he just goes wow and ends up giving me $5 for having to deal with him.\n\nSo I took the pre-tip off and call up the hotel dude to let him know his request had be fulfilled, and also told him about how being the only female driver at my store I've been dragged into rooms, and seen more penises than I'd care to. I wished him a nice night before hanging up on him, while he was still stammering about what I said. At least I made him feel like the asshole he was in the end!\n\nSo that's how I lost the lowest tip I got all night!",

Usually there are no problems. We run in, the people behind the counter call the name that was provided with the order, and they come up to pay/sign and leave. \n\nThis time I get there, they call the name once, and nothing. Call again, and nothing. At this point I'm wondering if it's supposed to be delivered to their actual address (occasionally customers will change their real address with the racquet club, and employees will forget to change it back to the primary address the next time they call) and I give a call to the phone number that's provided. \n\nI don't get an answer (a big problem with being an out of towner with a different area code) so I leave a voicemail asking to call back at my number so we can confirm the correct address.\n\nCut to an hour later, we get a call to the actual store from her and I'm the one to answer. \n\nCustomer: \"Yeah I ordered a delivery to the racquet club well over an hour ago and we still don't have it. Where is our order?\" \n\nMe: \"What was the name for that order, Miss?\"\n\nCustomer: \"My name is Jessica.\"\n\nMe: (Not seeing an order with that name, but knowing full well it was hers, as it was the only order to the racquet club) \"Ok and what was it you ordered?\"\n\nCustomer: \"Medium cheese and a small pepperoni.\"\n\nMe: \"Ah. Yeah I have the name for that order under Mike. I actually was there about an hour or so ago and they called the name \"Mike\" a few times with no response so I called the number that was provided a couple times and left a voicemail.\n\nCustomer: \"Yeah I know the name for the phone number is under Mike. But my name is Jessica. So I didn't hear it.\" \n\nMe: \"... Ok... I also called the phone number that was provided and left a voicem-\"\n\nCustomer: \"Yeah that's Mike's number could you just get down here as soon as possible. They're (the racquet club) is about to close soon.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah no problem.\"\n\nI get there and forgot her name. I don't even know if I caught her actual name, I just remember it started with a J, but I told the people behind the counter \"I'm back for the same person\". I fill them in on what happened, so they get on the intercom,\n\n\"Mike's wife, please come to the front desk, your pizza is here again.\"\n\nWouldn't you know it, she shows up.\n\nI make sure to inform her to leave a phone number we can reach her at if she ever orders for delivery, that way we can avoid these things. Then I walk out after laughing it off with the racquet club employees, after they tell me she was berating them for not having her order as well. They have literally zero control over that.\n\nYou'd think this shit would be common knowledge for most folks but I guess not.",

But I guess they hired a new guy who doesn't quite fit that mold. \n\nEvery time he delivers he parks his car all the way up my drive way, sometimes blocking other drivers, and he's always playing loud offensive rap music. He leaves it on even as he's handing me the food. He's also extremely rude and unprofessional. He has his pants sagging all the way down, untucked shirt, and smells like weed (im not anti weed I just don't think you should smell like it at work). \n\nHe never greets me with a hello, or says sir, or how are you, he just walks up to me very slowly and hands me a receipt without saying anything. I sign it and give it to him. He gives me my food, I say thank you, he says nothing and walks away. This has happened many times already. At first  i thought he might be a mute, but then he called me asking for directions to my house once(even though I live less than half a mile from the store)\n\nI'm not sure what to do.

He's the only person in my life who I've ever contemplated not tipping, but I still tip him like everyone else because I always pretip ahead of time. Would it be possible to ask the manager to not have that guy come to my house ? Would the manager just tell me to fuck off and not order from them if I did that ? Or what if he fires the guy and I have to worry about retaliation from the driver ? \n\nAnd to add even more to a shitty situation, the driver in question happens to be African American. What if it makes me look like a bigot ? Obviously I'm not but they don't know me. There have been at least 7  drivers from that restaurant who've delivered to me and they were great, but they were White. How's it going to look if I complain about the only African American ? The last thing I want to be known as in that restaurant is that fucking racist down the street. \n\nSo what do I do ? Do I begin finding a new place ? ",

My boss was great, the cooks were great, most of the other employees were great, the food, blah blah blah. But my job at CFP was to work the counter. I was not really a driver, I might occasionally pick up slack if I could, but anytime I delivered it was most likely that someone called close to closing time after our drivers left for home, and I was getting off soon. So I'd pay, take the food, and keep what they gave me as long as it was cash. It worked out for people that WAY wanted delivery (read:high) and were willing to bend over backward to get it.\n\nI'm at work and it's about 10 minutes before I'm off, the whole place closes soon after, and the usual drivers went home way before.\n\nWe get a call from HPx, I didn't take the call I was doing my closing duties.

I walk over to the wall near where they are. They're sitting on the patio and the flood lights are refracting really well through the smoke. Everything in the backyard was well lit (heh).\n\nSo I stay a bit quiet and go to the block wall within visual and when I think they aren't looking I quickly put the bag of food up on the block wall.\n\nAnd I wait.\n\nIt didn't take long before...\n\n&gt;HP1: Wait, is that...is that chinese food?! Did you order chinese food?\n\n&gt;HP2: I think so, where? Holy shit.\n\n&gt;HP3?1?: That's chinese food!\n\n&gt;Me: [I put up the smaller second bag]\n\n&gt;HP1: Wait. Who's there?\n\n&gt;Me: Order chinese food? CFP? Is this 1234 E Street rd?\n\nWe had a good laugh. Called my buddy over. Had some more laughs.\n\nTL;DR: Ninja put some chinese food within sight of the stoned customers. They saw magic chinese food. Laughs.\n\nEdit: formatting",

After a couple minutes of not being able to find the house, I set the pizza bag on top of my car to fish my phone out to call the customer. He explains that they're actually down the street and he'll wait outside his house so I can find him easily. I get back in my car and drive down the block to see him standing outside his house on the sidewalk. As I'm getting out of my car he starts laughing and says \"Wow, I've never had a pizza delivered like this before.\" At first I thought he was referring to my car, which looks a little sportier than most cars delivery drivers would drive, until I turn and see the pizza bag still ON TOP of my car. It was pretty heavily weighted down by all the pizzas and didn't fall off the trunk where I had set it because it had been held in by the lip spoiler on my car. \n\nI went into full panic mode and just nervously laughed and mumbled something like \"Yeah...\", took a $5 tip and left without a complaint.\n\nNone of my coworkers know even to this day.",

Most time, it was just normal people doing what you'd expect.  But every once in a while, there'd be something really weird going on.  Something you couldn't explain and then I'd spend the rest of the shift trying to figure out the other pieces of the puzzle.  So this is [a comic about that.](http://www.thewebcomicfactory.com/comic/tales-of-pizza-weird-delivery/)",

        "text": "This happened a year ago, but I just found out about this sub and decided I wanted to share this story. \n\nI live in a fairly small town, but there's another town to the south of us that doesn't have any pizza places. We're not really supposed to deliver there, but my general manager feels bad for them, so we do anyway. It's really only two places in the town that ever order from us: both of them nursing homes. \n\nIt happened on one such delivery. Someone from the larger of the two nursing homes had ordered delivery and I took it out there. \n\nI walked in as normal and found the customer sitting in the dining area at the end of a long table. She and about five other ladies were sitting there and talking to each other. I get the money, she tells me to keep the change, I give her the pizzas, and I start to leave. Standard delivery procedure. \n\nBut then. \n\nI turned around to walk out of the dining area so I could leave, and as I did I made eye contact with one of the other ladies at the table, and she had a look in her eye that made me super uncomfortable, but I tried to hide that as best I could. She looked something like [this](http://imdb.com/name/nm0920800/), but less attractive, if you can believe that. A second later, I heard something come from her direction. What I heard was her calling out to me, saying \"YOOHOOO!\" in a very sing-songy type voice. \n\nIt startled me, so I stopped walking, looked over at her, and nervously said \"I'm sorry?\" She looked at me again the way she had before. And then again came the horrid sound of \"YOOHOOO!\"\n\nAt this point, I had no idea what to think, but it wasn't left up to my imagination. I looked at the ladies sitting next to her, hoping to get some kind of an explanation. This was a mistake. \n\nThe lady sitting to her right, sort of laughed quietly, looked straight at me, and nonchalantly said \"She wants some sex!\"\n\nOh. Hell. No. \n\nIt was at this point that I dispensed with all politeness and walked as fast as I could out of that dining area. As I walked past the receptionist to leave the building, I heard one final \"YOOHOOO!\" and looked at the receptionist with an expression of pure panic, never slowing down as I walked out the door. \n\nWorst delivery I ever took. \n\n",

        "text": "Like the title says I wish phone had no part in pizza places. Being an instore I usually answer the phone most of the time and I can honestly say phones are more of an inconvenience then anything. They always ring at the worst times it seems. Especially in my store my manager loves to send me to answer the phones and sometimes if your really unlucky you can be up there for awhile. But my least favorite part about the phones is they never stop ringing ever. I know phones are here to stay in pizza places I just needed to vent about it. ",
