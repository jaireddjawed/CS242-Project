        "text": "TLDR: Get a friend a job at my work, he turns the boss against me, I delete over 6 years of programs so he can't use them and put a damper on parts getting out on time.¬† \n\nThis took place back in 2008/9ish time frame when layoffs everywhere were pretty heavy. Fortunately for me I worked in the tool and die automotive trade and work was still busy. \nThis place I worked at was like the speed of a trailer factory but all machining type of work. Everyday was a crisis to get parts to heat treat so they can ship on time. Always balls to the wall. \n\nI bumped into a coworker from a previous job (let's call him pip squeak) while at the bank on a Friday cashing my check. He mentioned being out of work for almost a year and I said I could get him a job where I was at. \n\nWell I did and I regretted it. I had been the group leader of the tool room here for nearly 7 years. My boss knew me well, my work ethic, my attendance and quality of work I produced. I programmed, setup and ran the wire edm, the Bridgeports, manual lathes, surface grinders, I did the mig and tig welding too. \n\nSo pip squeak gets the job and immediately goes to work behind the scenes turning the boss and everyone else against me.(my thanks for getting him work I guess) Still not sure how. And to top it off this guy didn't do anything. Not so much as to drill a hole in a 50hr week. He also came back in the evening to clock back in until the middle of the night racking up hours he didn't earn and on the weekends too. Up to 90hrs a week. ... for doing literally zero. Nothing to show for it. \n\nThe owner gives him my wire edm and all the jobs I have programmed. And they were GOOD programs, easy setups, so all he had to do was push a button. \nNext the owner gives him my group leader position. I also find out he's making about $5 more an hour. \n\nWhen I try to teach him the programming software he disappears flirting with the ugly office gals. Refusing to learn it because I \"can do it faster\" \n\nI've had enough and decide to leave but 2 weeks before I walk out(quit without notice) and turn my wire edm over completely to him I delete 6+years of wire programs I made, did it 2 weeks early so there would be no backups of them to retrieve when they try. \n\nNow he's forced to learn the software and do something. But this was more revenge to the owner for his bad decision making. But still a 2 for 1 deal because I know it hurt them both.",

        "text": "First post and on mobile so I apologize for formatting and length.\nWhen my kid was little and I was recently divorced we moved in with my mother whose neighbors kids to the left didn't like her. There were 3 young teens and a baby. \nWhen I moved in my mother bought a trampoline and a swing set for my kiddo to play on and set them up in the backyard. Now the backyard has a tall privacy fence and had a simple lock on the back gate. \nThe neighbor's kids smashed the lock and made a mess of the yard so my mother asked that they stay out of the yard because it's private property and she would be liable for any injuries the kids had while playing on the equipment, they loved the trampoline in particular. The neighbors essentially told her to f off so she went and bought a better lock for the gate and a lock for the fence around the trampoline. So they started stacking stuff (yard furniture, boxes, junk) on either side of the fence so they could climb over and cut a giant access hole in the net fence around the trampoline. So my mom took the trampoline down. The kids retaliated by digging a hole under the fence (the pile of dirt was outside the fence right next to their driveway so it was super obvious), kidnapping my dog and taking her to the animal shelter. \nI paid the fines and got her out of puppy jail and made sure that there were bricks and large rocks all along the inside of the fence next to their property but I was less than happy about the situation (I'm slow to anger). Then they started throwing their baby sister's used diapers over the fence instead of just dropping them in the trash and I had to clean those up too but I wasn't very confrontational back then so I just let it simmer. \nAnd then my kiddo got assigned to pick up the dog poop in the yard as her chore (she was probably about 7-8 at the time) and my mother got her a long handled pooper scooper to help make it easier for her. She did a good job clearing the poop but I went out to check on her and noticed that instead of just using the scoop as a shovel she would square up on the little pile with her back to the fence, plant her little feet, aggressively scoop under the poop and then yeet the whole pile backwards, over her head and it would sail through the air.... \nI asked her what she was doing and her response was that if she threw the poo behind the bushes that it would just be fertilizer for the plants and she wouldn't have to actually bag it and throw it away. At this point I was in tears laughing because 1. That's not really how that works but I appreciate kid logic and 2. She underestimated her yeeting abilities because instead of landing inside the fence but behind the bushes she was actually catapulting piles of dog poo onto the neighbor's roof, lots of little splattered piles.\nIt didn't start out as petty but after I finished laughing I left the kiddo to her catapulting",

He then seeminglu vanished off the face of the earth in January. Fast forward to last night, I get a friend request from a random account that wasn't sent from a game. I got curious and decided to accept it to see what they wanted. Straight away it was clear that it was either a friend pranking me or an old friend reaching out because\n1. They knew my name\n2. They knew I'm from the UK\n3. They know I'm studying history to make it my profession.\nThis is the part where it gets weird. Like any confused human being on the Internet I asked who they are and if they're an old friend or current one since they'd have no way of knowing those things about me otherwise, but they avoided that question and replied with things like \"I'm nobody\" or \"I know you but you don't know me\" before unadding me. Today, I check my tik tok to see a random account viewed my profile. The pfp was one of those default email ones where it's a solid block of colour with the initial of your email in the middle. This raised red flags for me because the types of videos I post wouldn't typically get on the fyp of those accounts, so I check the user and it rings a bell, so I went onto the platform they added me on yesterday and searched up the user which confirmed my original suspicion that it's an old friend AND told me who it was. Now, my revenge. I've put them in a pretty tight spot now by telling him I know who he is. Now I await the answer, otherwise all he can do is ghost me, again!",

Well here's the catch, we have already stated that we don't have the room for any more big toys and will buy them ourselves so that we can figure out space.\nFiance's sister has mentioned a few times that she is getting it and any other big toys she can in order to annoy my fiance and go against her wishes.\nThe thing she forgets is she has 3 boys that are already loud and messy (oh and have recently moved back in with fiance's parents and are already annoying parents) so my little act of pettiness? \nI've order a pack of 48 assorted noise makes (whistles, clappers etc) and plan on ordering a few kazoos and messy toys for the boys, as she already moans about the noise they make should be fun right?.\nSo now I ask you fellow petty guys and gals, what are some other noisy and messy gifts I can get them to enact sweet petty revenge?.",

        "text": "If you don't know what a \"revenge dress\" is, just google it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou might be wondering why TF I am making a *Tudor* revenge dress. let me take you back 9 years when I started dating my ex. I was 27 and he was 21. we dated from November- February. In this time, he got really intense, like not even a month in, asking why I wasn't thinking about kids with him, getting mad that I won't let him take care of me trying to change how my roommate at the time did things in our apartment. insisted that he was living with me, even though I stated \"absolutely not. Not until you have lived on your own for a year at least.\" (he was in his last year of college and living at home) condescending my independence, upset if I asked for some alone time (I had to *ask* that I have a day alone or tell him I was having a sister night), and by the end I am pretty sure he was trying to get me pregnant.\n\nat the end of February, when I start to look forward to the warm months, I realized the idea of spending time with him I was miserable at the idea. So I broke up with him. For the next 6 months he stalked and harassed me, asking when we could be friends again. Mutual friends we telling me he was insistent that he was going to get me back. I swear he though everything in life was going to be like the movies or TV. He finally left me alone when he met the woman that became his wife. he got her pregnant and then got married before the year was over. But the damage was done. I was a shell of a human who withdrew from the very small social scene in my area. he even had wormed his way into my oldest circle of friends that I never introduced him to, so I couldn't even hang out with my other friends. \n\nhe burned bridges with the friends I met him through so he finds a new circle of people too. A year or so later my now boyfriend moves to the area. he is in the SCA (basically historical larping) and my ex has joined the SCA so they meet and become friends. long story short my ex hasn't learned boundaries and that he can't just manipulate everyone around him without some people catching on, and he damaged his friendship with my now boyfriend.   \n\n\na year ago in September my boyfriend and I start dating and he finds out I'm *that* Kellygreen802, and we share stories and puzzle pieces get put into place. he is a bit worse than either of us thought. anyway, my BF wants me to go to an SCA weekend event and I LOVE to sew and wear costumes so I am down I made a simple dress and made a persona for the event. He did warn me that ex will probably be there and I say thats fine, I can ignore him. (Side note; we live in a small community so my BF was trying to mend the fence with him and i said I can ignore him, but I will not interact with him until he appologises for how he behaved after the break up)  he talked to ex and said if you want to come to the things I host here, you will have to talk to Kelly.   \n\n\nthe camping weekend comes and I was very able to ignore him even if we were in the same group of people, but apparently after that weekend he asked my BF not to bring me to any events.  \n\n\nfast forward to now and my BF wants me to go to the holiday event in january.  I plan on making the most elaborate Tudr gown with beading and layers of fabric, and because of my BFs \"rank\" in the make believe kingdom court I can wear a circlet as I am his \"consort\". It is going to piss him off so much  \n\n\nI will update after the event if this gets any attention",

So if there‚Äôs a chance I can be petty to them, I will. There‚Äôs a coworker whom I think I sort of had a spark a few weeks ago. He is what I would consider a high value man; good job, tall, cute, sexy voice, interesting hobbies, and he also used to be fat. I never knew that about him until he showed me his before pics. He likes to run and I also like to run, so I suggested doing a 5-10 K race in the town we work. And we left it at that, however, I haven‚Äôt seen him lately until yesterday; didn‚Äôt feel that same rapport as before and I also felt rejected. I saw some other female co worker who is rail thin waif looking approached him and said something like ‚Äúyou better bring me chocolate if you‚Äôre gonna sit at my desk‚Äù\nA few minutes later he brought her chocolate. I got insanely jealous and petty, so when she wasn‚Äôt looking I took the chocolate and hid it to probably leave it at the main kitchen in the office where I know people eat whatever they find there. So there, I felt relieved and I felt good. That‚Äôs my petty story.",

(Sorry in advance if my formatting is bad, writing isn't my strong suit) I'll call my cousin joe for this story; joe lives in a small town in between where I live and Tucson, he moves there in 2016 after graduating college the same year. for the most part he lived quietly for a few years until early this year his new neighbor Karen moved in. joe described her like the typical Karen look nut a little overweight. at first, she keeps to herself but would complain to all the neighbors about small thing she finds in their yards to nitpick, but nobody takes it seriously. joe mainly kept of her raider but that would change during the summer when he notices a bunch of dog turds laying in his yard, joe doesn't own a dog. he has cameras that cover his house, so he went and took a look to see where their coming from and it was Karen dog when she would go for a walk. the camera clearly shows her stopping at the corner of his yard and her letting her dog loose in joes' yard to do its business. joe went to her house and told her to stop letting her dog poop in his yard, she denied it until he told her he has cameras, and it caught the whole thing. her defense: well, your yard already looks like a dump so it shouldn't bother you now. that pissed him off because he takes care of his lawn every week and doesn't take kindly to that. he tells her that if she keeps letting her dog poop in his yard, he'll get police involved and he walked away. not even a week later he finds more dog poop in the same spot and Karen on the camera letting her dog loose, he wasn't kidding about letting police know and later that day they came by and gave her a ticket for her dog pooping in other people's yards. Karen gets pissed and comes to joe's house telling him that he will be paying for the ticket, he politely told her to piss off and slammed the door on her. this doesn't stop Karen from letting her dog poop on joe's lawn and every time he calls the cops on her. this repeats three more times before joe decides to take matters into his one hands and teach Karen a lesion. Joe bought a water pellet gun from the wall of mart a few years prier and barrow a full body camo sute from a friend and waited for a day when Karen would take her dog for a walk. that Tuesday at three she left for her run and joe set his trap. it didn't take long for Karen to come back and right as she let her dog loose (a beagle) and it ran to the same spot, joe emerged from his hiding spot and opened fire. not hitting the dog but right near it causing it to run back. as Karen was about to curse joe out, she realized he set her in his sight and joe opened up at her hitting her in the chest, crouch, and rear back as she ran. she called the cops, and it was the same ones who ticketed her the previous times. when they saw the footage of what happened, they couldn't stop laughing as Karen was fuming at them. they then gave her another ticket and told her if they had to come out her again, they would have animal control come out and take her dog away as she clearly didn't learn her lesion the first time. when she asks why joe was getting off free, they just said her dog was in his yard and he was free to do as he pleased. form that day on Karen avoided joe and his yard, what got me laughing hard was what he said she was wearing, and the color of the water pellet he used. she was wearing spandex pants and tank top that was two sizes too small and were colored white, the pellets were yellow. it looked like she pissed herself as she was running away to her house. me and the rest of the family were laughing after hearing this and couldn't top that with what else was going on with our own stories from the years, even mine about how someone though I was too young to buy scratchers.",

So, I always ask them to move all the meat, and I even acknowledge how petty it is but.. whatever, I pay for it and I am pretty nice when I ask. The problem is that they never do it lol NEVER. They always give me half the meat I paid for.\n\nSo I knew this was going to happen when we went out on Thursday - so after we sat down and ordered the half and half Pizza with my little request to move all the meat over, I also placed a pick up order for the same Pizza but just as it normally comes. Our half and half Pizza came out, and I asked the waitress if they had moved over all the meat and she said yes. So I went inside and picked up our other order and proceeded to take all the meat I could out of both Pizzas until I could show the differences in the plate Meat Mountains I put together.\n\nMy wife was embarrassed the whole time but I just hated that for years this has been happening and I could never compare or call anyone out. I ended up getting both Pizzas for free. And before anyone says that I am a dick, I was nice but definitely frustrated them. I worked in restaurants before so I understand annoying customers, but if someone asked me to just move the meat over I would have done it.\n\nTldr: I honestly don‚Äôt know how to summarize this lol",

        "text": "I don't know if this fits in this subreddit, but I recently thought of it and would like to share it. I remember in 1st Grade, there was this kid who continuously bullied. I think the reason was I was a brown-skinned person living in a predominantly white neighborhood. This kid didn't intimidate me. He mainly just annoyed me.\n\n(Que Revenge) One day, in Science Class, we were learning about how our body parts moved. (About tendons and how you can move your hands/legs) There was this one really gross example were  they brought in a dead chicken. The tendon was still attached, and the teacher showed how the tendon makes the part move. This bully sat next to me in that class. In that class, he was eating one of those white cheese sticks. (You know the ones, string cheese. You'd peel the cheese off) I noticed that the tendons in the chicken where white and stringy, like the cheese. So, I leaned over and told him, \n\n\"You know that you're eating chicken tendons?\". \n\nI got told on, but I think it was worth it. I don't know if this qualifies as petty revenge but it will live in my head for ever.\n\nSorry if I didn't format this post correctly, or for bad grammar or spelling.",

        "text": "So many years ago I had a well paying job and growing passion for Scotch.  I collected some rare bottles and bought and sold whiskey online for fun.  My go to at the time was Macallan 18 and most nights I would kick back and relax with two fingers of bliss in a glass. I worked offshore 30 days on and thirty days off which is somewhat relevant.  One day while shopping for a good deal on scotch I came across the Macallan 18 for something like 160USD/bottle which was a pretty good price back then normal was closer to 200.  I jumped on it and ordered a full case.  Note I frequently ordered scotch from overseas vendors and even individual collectors.  I didn't think much on it until the next time I was home from work and still had not received so much as a tracking number (after something like 8-12 weeks). I tried emailing the vendor and got no response. I tired aggressively emailing the vendor....I tried calling and leaving messages for vendor.  Nothing... so I did what I should've done in the first place which was research the vendor and lo and behold this vendor has a habit of ripping off anyone ordering expensive spirits from anywhere outside of the UK.  Tons of stories about people getting ripped off.  All the positive reviews were from fellow brits.  I contacted my credit card company who said they could cancel his payment if he did not respond to their notice within a certain timeframe.  That timeframe came and went, and then on the day that the credit card company reversed the payment he shipped the booze.   Problem was he had already missed the date so I got my money back and about 4-5 months after ordering it I got a case of scotch free of charge.  I kept a few bottles and gave a few away to my brother and best friend.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  Overseas vendor rips off out of country buyers but due to my credit card company's policies I was able to turn the tables and got a lot of free macallan 18.",

On several occasions, after parties, he would lay down in one of my (girl) friends beds, without asking, and wait for them (we've had to remove him multiple times). when confronted he blames his past relationships for ruining him. I was also seeing a girl in our class, and when we had a one week break, he texted her saying, \"do you want a serious dicking?\" Real class act.\n\nAnyway:\n\nOne night, My class is out at the bars. I was talking to one of Bs friends who mentions that B said \"why are you talking to OP, I fucking hate OP.\" I'm all about confrontation, so i wanted to chat with him.

Aside from removing him from my friends beds, and cock blocking him, I guess.\n\nAs the night goes on I hear someone go up to B and say \"hey, the bar was crazy, so I just put my drinks on your tab and l Venmo you.\" \n\nWithout hesitation, I turn to my friend and his girlfriend and ask what they want to drink. And I end up getting a few drinks courtesy of B's tab. \n\nFelt nice, loved the free drinks, and it was definitely enough to help me forget about the issue! But I still don't like him",

He was known to blabber false stories to other kids in a exaggerated way. Per example, we have an assignment to remember what we did on the weekend, and he wrote down that he went cruising with his dad on his brand new lamborghinni, or saying that he went on a amazing trip.\nI already knew that this was fishy, I grew up with a brother though sadly would bully me too but I don‚Äôt want to explain about it, who my brother bullcraps every story like my bully in a exaggerated way.\n\nI didn‚Äôt do anything, but one of the kids ask his dad and his dad responded with. ‚ÄúOh, (Bully name) is exaggerating, this is not true we don‚Äôt have a lamborghini, none of his stories are real.‚Äù You can already tell that everyone at school wasn't happy and ordered him to stop his bullcraps.\n\nNow, once a year my class would do an international food. All of us, bring in foods from our countries. Now, I have mentioned that I am Swiss, but I am also very mixed. My mum was from Ex-Yugoslavia and my dad is german.\nSo, I decided to make a croatian dish called Cevapicci, and my favourite croatian/serbian soup, bean soup. Those recipes where from my maternal grandmother, and I always loved her cooking.\nI made it the day before, brought it everything to school, and my bully said ‚ÄúUgh, I think you‚Äôll bring in something disgusting, I won‚Äôt try it and maybe everyone as well won‚Äôt try it.‚Äù I rolled my eyes but I ignored him, the morning went smoothly, then came lunch. Teachers and the students were bringing in their foods, and wouldn't you know it Bully still criticize my food.\n\nI breathe in and out through my nose, but if I was an emoji, I would be the one with the smoke coming out of their nose.\n\nWhen my soup and sausages where heated, the heavenly smells hit the noses of each and every student in the classroom, including Bully.\n\nPetty revenge initiated\n\nEvery student stares at my food, and they all ask for the sausage and the soup, it was all gone within minutes, manage to save myself some aside, as I tried some of their food. And low and behold Bully approached me, he was staring at the container, not aware that it was empty, and ask. ‚ÄúIs there some soup and sausages left?‚Äù\n\nI smirked, and showed him the empty container in satisfaction. ‚ÄúNope, everyone got it but you. Didn‚Äôt you say that my food is disgusting. And, you didn‚Äôt want to try it? Why should I give you some?‚Äù He stared wide-eyed at the empty container, and tried to demand to give him some of my food that I left aside. I shook my head, and showed him that even my plate was empty. He stayed silent, and glared at me and tried to complain to the teachers about it, but they said ‚Äòsorry, but it‚Äôs all gone.‚Äô\n\nBully was frustrated, and he did bring food from his country, but it wasn‚Äôt homemade, it was store bought. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what he bought, but I didn‚Äôt want to eat his food after what he said to me. He glared at me when I refused, and I just shrugged and said ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to try it, you bought it store made and not homemade.‚Äô\nThe look of disbelief on his face was priceless, while the teachers haven't heard what I say. \n\nWriting it, still made me chuckle and laugh about it, and I still remember the look of disbelief and anger he gave me, but can‚Äôt do anything about it was satisfying to see.",

I‚Äôm gonna be with him for life!‚Äù. I believed in all of that until the friend group both of us were in started telling me that he had been cheating on me. The thing is, we were in a long distance relationship because I had strict parents and we lived in different cities. However, the ldrs relationship never bothered me until people within our friend circle who went to the same school as him told me that he was cheating on me. \n\nIn our relationship, he talked a lot of shit about the ex before me and I was dumb enough to hate her until my ‚Äúperfect‚Äù world crumbled. I was ready to text her and I did, trying to figure out if he lied about a lot of things (which he did). Let‚Äôs call her Caro. Caro and I talked whilst I was processing my breakup with the cheater. After I broke up with my ex, I actually had a thing with Caro and she liked me too so we decided that we‚Äôd kiss and send a picture of us kissing to the ex and make sure our friend group talks about our relationship. We heard that he absolutely bawled after hearing it and cried even harder after seeing the picture. Worth it. Me and Caro still have a good friendship and we decided to end our relationship because we preferred being friends. We‚Äôve been really good friends for 4 years. :) No idea what‚Äôs up with our ex now.",

The other day I was off work soy wife and I were both in the car taking him to school because we had a few things to do in town that morning.  The last road we take is a narrow blacktop that goes right to the school as it avoids driving through town.  This same road sometimes has some younger drivers because it also goes right to the local high school.\n\nThis particular lovely day I had noticed a newer full sized pickup behind me, a very nice one with wide tires.  This was not unusual since this is a farming community.  I was up to about 50 when the truck suddenly swung out to pass me, spraying gravel all over my wifes car.  The rocks hit the windshield hard enough I was worried it had broken it.  He had also gotten off the road badly enough I was worried he was going to crash.  Luckily he didn't.  He then proceeded on his merry way at 70 to 75mph, in a 55.  I watched the truck and noticed it pulled into the highschool parking lot.\n\nI wanted to say something to him, but I also knew he was probably a 16-18 year old kid and me saying something wouldn't go over well.  Plus kid in car.  So I stayed cool.  Dropped my kid off and plotted revenge.\n\nMy wife and I came back after our errands and took a picture of the truck, asked a few people we knew if they recognized the truck.  Thanks to it being a small community we had an answer within minutes.  A little Facebook and Google work and I knew his dad's name and phone number.\n\nI very politely messaged his dad about the situation, answered dad's questions and said I just wanted him to be aware before someone got hurt or his son got caught by the cops.  I really didn't figure I'd find out what the punishment was.\n\nI kinda forgot my wife has a friend in the highschool.  But we did notice the truck wasn't in the lot the next day.  Apparently dad took away the truck and made his 18 year old son ride the bus. In the words of my wife's friend he was \"salty.\" I got a pretty good laugh out of that, I had to admit.  \n\nI hope he thinks twice before he drives like a moron next time.  If not, well I guess my next conversation will be with the county sheriff, but I really don't want to be that guy.  I remember being young and dumb, I'm still relatively dumb sometimes, I just don't like people endangering my wife and kid.",

I received a Black Friday promo that would give me 50% their annual price for the new Uber One.  When I  tried to sign up for it, it wasn't allowing me since I was on Uber  Pass. I reached out to customer service and was advised to cancel my subscription so that I can sign up. I waited three days to be able to  sign up for it and it didn't work. I was then told by another customer support rep they couldn't help me because I wasn't subscribed....after I  was told to cancel.  I then lost the promo that many new people got and  me as a loyal customer did not. I ate my anger and signed back up because I use it a lot.\n\nI thought I  had signed up for an annual plan, but for some reason was set on a  monthly. After one year (and $120) later, I decided to check and see if I  can switch to an annual. I was unable to make the switch and was told to cancel again. The app gave me a renewal promo, but it was for a monthy and I had no option to switch.  I reached out to customer support and they did the same thing they did the previous time. Every person I  talked to told me something different and it was as if no one was listening to me. Just pasting an auto-response (like you did). Even after showing the previous promo and discussing the new offer I was presented with, I was told that no one can help me and that I would have to pay full price still. Every interaction I've had with them has felt like I've been talking to AI. There is never any supervisor and during  the conversations, it's as if\n\nIt also came to my attention that people who took advantage of the deal last year were given a $60/year renewal, meaning they would have paid  $110 for two years, while I paid $120 for one year. So I then decided to post on different social media platforms letting people know that if they are Uber One users, they can save some money. A few people have already taken advantage, so Uber could have just saved the money by just having better customer relations.\n\nFeels petty, but hey.",

I gave him my number and told him we could be friends and talk about what he wanted ( I know it‚Äôs sex I‚Äôm not giving it, but I would be able to invite him back to my bar if we were friends)\n\nThe lights turned on ( club is closed ) and he was maxed out on his limit for taking money out on his card so he cashed app me the last tip for 20% for his bill.\n\n3 weeks later I see that he asked his bank to dispute the charge and since he did it first I couldn‚Äôt do it back to get my proper refund. \n\nBut I did see he used his joint account that included his wife‚Äôs name on the card so I did a little research and found all of her social media accounts. \n\nAnd before I was gonna contact her I tried to call him and just see if we can settle this cause in the end i didn‚Äôt wanna try to ruin his marriage I just wanted my refund it‚Äôs almost the holidays.

She‚Äôs always demanding and it would be so bad at times my grandma, my dad, and my uncle all at one point tried calling her out but she takes it as a jokes\n\nReal story: yesterday my mom asked me to make my little sister a sandwich. I didn‚Äôt respond to the message as I left the phone on the bed and was fixing my Guinea pigs‚Äô cage. 4 minutes later she responds with ‚Äúwhen you guys want something don‚Äôt ask bye‚Äù \n\nAfter seeing the message I was confused. I thought she sent it an hour ago and got mad but then saw those two messages were 4 minutes apart. Immediately I knew she was in one of her moods. After a minute of mentally preparing myself. I got up and went to the pantry only to see we had one piece of bread left on the bag. I knew my mom would get mad so I found this opened bag of bread with three stale slices left. I threw the stale slices away (in the bag) away. \n\nFive minutes later she got up and found the bag in the trash can and got them. She yelled at me dad something along the lines of ‚Äúlook what she did. Are you going to teach her a lesson or what?‚Äù. I of course heard this, got out of my room and defended myself. I don‚Äôt know how long this post can be so I‚Äôll skip the next parts. She continued yelling me about my solution. She said she wasn‚Äôt getting us iPhones for Christmas (which we did not ask for and if she‚Äôs so worry about bread maybe don‚Äôt buy expensive phones?)\n\nAfter having time to cool off I did my laundry and coincidentally her laundry was there too. Most of her stuff was dried besides this pillow so I put it back on the dryer with the remainder of my clothes. She messaged me to bring her stuff and I did. The moment I stepped into her room she starts asking me ‚Äúwhy did just throw my clothes to the side? Why didn‚Äôt you dry them?‚Äù After clearing that up I left her room to mine. I had my AirPods on since music helps me be calm, so I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. Apparently she told me something but I didn‚Äôt know. \n\nI woke up to a message saying I was only allow to ask for one thing this Christmas. Now I want to ask for something stupidly expensive. Perhaps I will get a new iPhone for Christmas? Or the newest iPad? Maybe I‚Äôll ask for a car considering I can now start driving.",

        "text": "I used to get bullied a lot in school. They mostly hated me because I was an A student. In my country, it was common for people of colour to hate on each other for succeeding. I wasn't raised to think like that though. I was raised to praise other people's successes. We all used to get along until we reached my country's equivalent of senior year. Those were the worst times for me. \n\nThey excluded me, made whole hate groups against me. Called me a piece of shit multiple times. Some of them even pushed me against a locker to try to intimidate me. Spread rumours about me. People put weird things in my bag as a prank. I wasn't alone though, my friend, who was also an A Student, got bullied too. It was horrible. The bullying was not too often physical, but it was rife.\n\nThen came our final exams, Entry exams and final assignments They all kept asking me for help with the work and learning for those entry exams. Arrogant people. They really thought I would help them. No. But I pretended too. I gave them good, but weak advice on how to do their essays( good enough so that they would pass, but get weak marks). Assignments counted 20% of our overall marks. I would promise to tutor them but never show up. One of them asked me out for prom (it's called \"Matric Dance\" in my country). I told him I would go, but never showed up. I just kept dodging them and breaking promises and messing with their marks. I refuse to help them in everywhere and knowing that they would be afraid to ask teachers for help, I told them: \"Do it anyway! I don't have as much time as I thought I would.\"\n\nThen when the last bully decided to hurt me once more, I was lucky enough to have some of my teachers as witnesses. So I finally got to report him with evidence. His bullying was put on his record. This bully had it coming. He once threatened our pregnant vice Principle to become a prefect. So everything was set up for his failure. All the universities he wanted to go to didn't accept him. \n\nAs for the rest of them, they passed their final exams but not enough to get into the courses they set their eyes on. They were so focused on getting back at me for not helping them the way they wanted that they failed to study hard enough(which i knew they would do). They're all now miserable, either doing courses that they never wanted or not being in university or college at all.(My country has strict requirements for entrance into higher institutions). \n\nFinally, I got into a course that I always dreamed of being in and guess what, I've gotten merit awards and made sure my bullies would see them on my social media. So that they would see that I succeeded regardless of their tormenting me. And my friend, he too got into one of the best universities in the country and now, he is going overseas with his qualifications, working in an renowned international company.

In either case, this ticket will call for some wasted administrative work on the part of the company.\n\nOne of these days he may even graduate to malicious compliance. \n\nSigned, \nProud wifey",

        "text": "Due to thanksgiving being tomorrow, I figured I would share a petty revenge story that took place in 2015 on thanksgiving and has been going since then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy uncle every year makes home made moon shine for parties. Usually apple pie flavored moonshine for Halloween, thanksgiving, and Christmas. My family is also the type of family that we are all around alcohol and from a young age (in America) you can enjoy a sip or 2 as long as it is a family event. \n\nYour 16 and just helped cook all day? Take a sip if you want.\n\nWell in 2015, my cousin decided, she did not want a sip, she wanted a cup. She waited for everyone to not be looking, filled a cup up with moonshine and drank the whole thing. This obviously did not go well since she was 15 and ended up throwing up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer mother, my aunt said it was my uncles fault for having it in plain view where she could reach. Well, he did not make a fuss, he simply said ok I will fix it. For the past 7 years (tomorrow) every time they have attended a part with alcohol he brings out his alcohol riser. - A huge stack of wood almost like a deck and places it right there on it. It is about 6 and a half feet off the ground so you have to reach over head for it, just not a lot. All of my uncles and my grandfather are 6 foot to 5'10. So it is a little of a reach but manageable. My aunt however is 5'4 and cant reach anything. The best part, my cousin who was the one who started all of this, grew to being 5'8 so now she reaches up and grabs what she wants. It is the biggest reach for her though.\n\nI have 4 cousins and she is the oldest one. The other 3 are ranging from 12-16 and are all around the 5 foot mark. So my uncle says he must leave it up in order to make sure the younger ones cannot access it. \n\nSo each party, my aunt has to ask my uncle to pour her drink. We all \"laugh\", she takes it and then by drink 3 almost all the alcohol is back on the normal table for all to reach. Sometimes it varies but it never stays up the whole night. Occasionally, he will pour her drink and then set it immediately on the table. If my other uncles pour a drink and immediately put it on the  table, nothing is said. \n\nShe did end up apologizing after a year or 2 I think but it still is used cause of my uncle not knowing what else to use it for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts a great story of classic sibling rivalry and a funny starter conversation for new comers.\n\n\"Why is your alcohol on a structure over 5 feet tall in the yard?\" \n\n\"what do you mean? that's the alcohol table, have you never had them?\"\n\n??",
