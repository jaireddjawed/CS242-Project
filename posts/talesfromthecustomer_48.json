        "text": "About a year ago, I went into an electronics store to buy an auxiliary cord. I got what I needed and was walking to the checkout, when I noticed a CD from a band that I liked in high school. I was interested because I didn't realize that this band was still making music, so I picked it up and started looking at the back.\n\nAbout a minute later, I heard someone behind me say \"I just bought that CD yesterday, it's awesome. You should get it.\" I jumped at this because I didn't notice that there was an employee standing behind me. This is how the rest of the conversation went:\n\nMe: \"Thanks, I'm glad to hear that it's good. I'll probably just check it out on Spotify.\" \n\nAssociate: \"Yeah, but, if you buy it, you like own it. And then you can like burn it to your laptop and stuff.\"\n\nMe: \"My laptop doesn't have a CD drive.\"\n\nThe employee then slowly BACKED away from me. He didn't say anything, he didn't turn around, he just silently backed away while looking at me the entire time. After he took about three steps backward, I couldn't help myself and I started nervously giggling. So there I am, standing in the middle of an electronics store giggling while an employee is backing away from me like I just told him I had just arrived from another planet.\n\nAnyway, this wasn't a bad retail experience. It just makes me chuckle every time I think about that poor, confused man. ",

The car salesman had already made us mad because the truck we had specifically called and asked about earlier in the day was suddenly sold and he was now trying to sell us another truck that cost us $10,000 more.  \n\nHe kept trying to pull the, \"How much do you want your monthly payment to be?\" bullshit.  We kept going around and around about the price of the truck.  He finally told us the monthly payment would be $506.61. I asked at what interest rate.  He froze like a deer in headlights.  He said, \"Let me talk to my manager.\"  Then he comes back and tells me he can't give me the exact interest rate.\n\nSo, let me get this straight - he could tell me my monthly payment to the penny but couldn't tell me how much interest we would be paying on the truck. My hubby and I proceeded to explain to him that we were not complete idiots and that he could shove his truck up the body part of his choice.",

        "text": "This is a story about the worst customer in the history of fast food, me. At the time I was in high school and made a lot of stupid decisions, on this particular night the stupid decision involved my friends and I getting pretty drunk and deciding we wanted some food. The fast food restaurant we went to only has their drive-thru open after 12 so we had to go through that. We went through the drive-thru open beers in everyone's hand acting like belligerent immature idiots (re: highschoolers).\n\nBefore anyone gets upset I have to note that we didn't bring a car there so no drunk driving. We decided we should at least pretend to be a car and proceeded to walk up to to the drive-thru window with 5 people in the formation of a car, crouched down as if we were sitting and with \"the driver\" manipulating a steering wheel. The employee at the window was surprisingly accomadating and actually agreed to take our order and give us food despite the fact that this is against protocol.\n\nSo of course I decided to be a dick and take it a step further. It became absolutely imperative that I get breakfast food immediately. After several insistences from myself that I wasn't leaving without breakfast food, and multiple rebuttals from the employee that it just wasn't possible she finally came up with a creative solution, \"well I have a cinnamon roll that has been sitting here since breakfast 12 hours ago but I really don't think you should eat it.\"\n\nDeal! I'll take it. I paid for my ancient cinamon roll and swallowed it in at most 2 bites. Apparently that employee was pretty smart because a cinnamon roll that's been sitting out for 12 hours is not the best choice of drunken midnight meals. Not three seconds after I had received my food I proceeded to violebtly vomit it all over the ground outside of the drive-thru window. A lesson to all fast food employees: the rules exist for a reason.",

        "text": "So I accidently posted this on TalesfromRetail and was advised to place here.\n\nI had an interview lined up last week with a brand that I've supported for a loooonnng time - It was for part-time work at one of their outlet locations while I'm getting settled into my new home. That day, I decided to go in early to check out the store, do some shopping and talk to the associates. I thought it would be a great way to make a good impression. And that resulted in the unexpected.\n\nI walked in and the store only had about 10-15 customers. I wasn't greeted (which doesn't always happen - I'm just a fan of it) but I walked by an employee folding shirts that made eye contact, gave me a full body scan and then looked away. I didn't really think much of it, but thought a smile at least would be nice. As I shopped, I grabbed a couple tops and jackets and two pairs of jeans and ended near the clearance section (which is where the fitting room was).\n\nIn the back, there were two female employees standing by the sales rounder not helping customers or doing anything work related. They were talking about a date last night. Before I knew it, one of the girls went from talking about dinner at some lame Italian restaurant and then drinks at home on a balcony to describing deep penetration. Trust me. Full detail. I looked around and there were 4 other people standing within a 10 foot vicinity and 2 others less than 20 feet away. Noone said anything, but I caught one customer staring. She was not quiet. She was not bashful. And I let it continue for 3 minutes to see if it was some sort of joke.\n\nWell, I interrupted. I walked up and asked the ladies if I could use the fitting room and one of them took my things from my hands without saying anything and they just kept talking! She was describing how his butt felt in her hand while they were having sex. AND I QUOTE \"It felt so amazing to grab, you could see my nail marks from being too rough\". I had to ask them if I could just go back myself, and she said no. So I said \"how I am supposed to try things on without my clothes?\" Her response was \"We'll be done is just a minute, hun.\"\n\nSo, I walked out. And then cancelled my interview over the phone. And then emailed corporate.\n\nWhat would you have done? I can't imagine working in a store that doesn't value their customer service or respect privacy. Did I do the right thing?",

And there's this great dumpling place in the Chinatown of my city (well, to be honest there are a few, I'm just especially fond of this one).  The place in question has great food, is super cheap but has some of the worst service I have ever experienced.  They also play a really weird happy birthday song at least once every time I've been there, but I guess that's not exactly stroy relevant.\n\nOn this day myself and 3 other friends (so there were 4 of us in total) headed into Dumplings for lunch.  We'd all had late breakfasts so it was a little late for lunch, probably around 3:00 PM.  There are a few people in the restaurant but no line so we get seated straight away.  We've all been here before so it's just a matter of deciding how much of our favourite items we want before ordering.\n\nThis place makes it's money with fast service, they seat you, take your order, get your food out ASAP and do not encourage loitering.  So, it's a predictably short period of time before we're asked if we know what we want.  After ordering the waiter starts taking our menus and I ask\n\n\"Can I keep this one menu in case we want some more?\"\n\nMy request is initially met by a silent stare, which felt like it lasted a millennia because it was so a weird and awkward reaction.  He then suddenly snatches it from my hand and says\n\n\"NO! No menu for you!\"\n\nAnd walks off.\n\nAfter a couple of seconds in shocked silence my friends and I all burst out into laughter.  We still go and eat there, the same guy still works there and I absolutely LOVE telling people that story.",

So our two families decided to go out to dinner at a small, fairly popular family owned Italian restaurant. \n\nEverything was going fairly well at first, we all got out food ordered and it came out without issues. My younger sister is a petty picky eater and had ordered chicken alfredo, a dish she loves when my dad makes it at home. \n\nAfter a few minutes of eating, she realized she didn't like this restaurant's version as it was made slightly different than what she was used to. After mentioning it to the parents, one of the restaurant owner's sons overhears and come over to the table and starts interrogating my sister in this thick Italian accent telling her how it's the best Italian food in the world and she has to like it. He proceeds to leave then come back every few minutes while my sister is sitting there terrifies.\n\nNext, the 70 year old owner comes over, and in the meanest voice I've ever heard demands my sister to tell her what's wrong with the food. She's basically yelling at her and when she gets no answer she walks over to a corner of the restaurant and just stands there staring us down for the rest of the meal. \n\nOur waitress comes over soon after (she was actually very nice and did what she could to help us) and explains how sorry she was that the owner was acting like that. At this point our entire group has lost our appetites and just wanted to get the hell out of there so we paid with most of our food less than half eaten and left immediately.\n\nWe were all fairly shocked as we left that the owner and her son would seriously treat customers that bad and we definitely don't plan on ever going back there.",

        "text": "First time posting in this sub, hopefully this is what you guys want to hear!\n\nTonight I attended a group dinner booked in a private room at a well known restaurant. There was ~20 of us there (less than the maybe 40 who were expected). We weren't any super prestigious party, it was a celebration for my boyfriend's professor who is retiring. \n\nWhile the food and people were fantastic, our server was not. I understand that we were a large number of people but we weren't in any rush and no one was complaining to the server or asking for weird substitutions.\n\nThe waitress got our drinks as we came in  then started by taking our order. We were seated at a long table, she stood at the very end of it leaning over an empty chair and instead of saying thank you or acknowledging the next person, she would just stare at us. We had to raise our voices across the room to place our order. Then my boyfriend decided he wanted to add mushrooms and onions to his steak (she still hasn't left the room to put the order in yet, so no big deal) so he loudly but nicely said \"excuse me\" to get her attention in which she looked at him then turned right back around at which point he gave up on trying to get his mushrooms.\n\nNext our food arrived awhile later (obviously a wait is to be expected since we were a group) but during our waiting time she didn't come back to see if we wanted any more drinks. Some people were drinking alcoholic beverages and wanted water as well and some just wanted more water. Absolutely nothing. She came in to give us our food and would say \"WHO ORDERED THE UHH...uhh... MOZZA BURGER?\" she clearly didn't know what any of the food was nor would she say \"you're welcome\" after placing it down in front of you. Then she disappeared for the whole duration of us eating, still no more drinks. She didn't see if we needed anything else. \n\nFinally she came in and asked who was paying at the table, everyone wanted to so she left for the machine, came back, and instead of saying \"here you go\" or trying to get your attention to give you the machine (she stood behind us for all of this) she would reach over you and thrust it in front of your face, at one point she took out her phone and started texting while waiting for someone to pay. When she got to my boyfriend she thrusted it into his face, he paid, didn't want his receipt so she ripped it off of the machine, crumpled it, threw it on the table, realized she forgot to check what he tipped her, uncrumpled it, checked, and threw it back down. She threw a lot of receipts on the table but seeing that really bothered me. She could have waited until we left to check.\n\nI felt like she kind of ruined a good tip on herself. She could have had 20 of us satisfied with her service and personality (manners mostly) but instead we were all annoyed and feeling rushed by her. We stayed for a bit longer to take pictures of the group and everyone thanked the prof and then we left. \n\nShe also kind of half started clearing our plates off the table once we had finished then she seemed to have given up after half the table so some of us were left with our plates in front of us for a bit. We were there for about two hours which didn't seem too bad since we were so large.",

        "text": "I originally posted this as a comment in /r/idontworkherelady, but I think it deserves its own post here. \n\nI am very pale, to the point that people ask if I'm albino (I'm not). However, most of my comments have to do with my hair, which looks like Macaulay Culkin's when he was in Home Alone. I also have blonde eyebrows and eyelashes, which everyone points out, amazed. \n\nBut the one instance that takes the cake was when I went to a major clothing/accessory store. I was wandering around, looking for nothing in particular, and a woman came up to me. She was fairly big, maybe in her mid-forties, and had obviously dyed platinum-blonde hair. Imagine Matilda's mother. She will be Zinnia Wormwood (ZW) and I will be Me. \n\nZW: \"Excuse me, but what colour dye do you use?\"\n\nMe: \"What?\" I had no clue what she was talking about at this point. \n\nZW: \"I said what colour hair dye do you use?\" Starting to sound annoyed. \n\nMe: \"Oh, I don't dye my hair.\" Which is true, and I turn around and start walking away. This isn't the first time I've been asked this. \n\nZW: \"Don't lie to me. Yes you do. There is no way that is natural.\" She says this in a combination of snottiness and annoyance that I can't ignore. \n\nMe: \"Look, ma'am. I don't dye my hair. You're barking up the wrong tree.\"\n\nZW: \"Young child! Don't talk to your elders like that!\"\n\nI just start walking away at that point, knowing this conversation is going nowhere fast. ZW sees this and does a 180° in her tone. \n\nZW: \"You don't have to lie to me. I won't tell anyone that your hair is dyed.\" She says this in the way you'd talk to a three-year-old to make her admit she ate the last cookie. She then winks at me. \n\nMe: At this point I had had enough. \"Look at my eyelashes. Have you ever heard of someone dying their eyelashes? I don't think so. So for the last time, I. Do. Not. Dye. My. Hair.\" I turn on my heals and walk away, ignoring her further pleas. \n\nTL;DR: Some snotty woman insisted that I dye my hair. I imagined dumping a bucket of bleach on her head, but it seemed like someone had already bleached her brain.\n\nEdit: changed the antagonist's name to Zinnia Wormwood. Thanks /u/laurenkelsi14 !",

        "text": "Like many American workers, I have a scant half an hour for my midday break. Not a big deal: I can often get some lunch in me and run an errand or two and still make it back to my desk without a problem.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not the case the other day. Thanks to my bank having only one teller and a customer who insisted in reorganizing all of her finances right then and there, I was a little squeezed for time. No biggie: I'll just hit up Fast Food Joint, grab a nasty death hamburger and get on with my day. Simple, right?\n\nNope. Not on this day. Had I been one minute earlier, all would have gone off without a hitch. Instead, I wound up behind two frighteningly stereotypical middle-class mothers with three children between the ages of 3 to 5 years. Obnoxious ones. One of the mothers had a very close approximation of [the dreaded haircut](http://imgur.com/gallery/GDgwI2x), and neither of them were making any effort to control their children or figure out their order - which with children is never a straightforward endeavor.\n\nNow I'm generally pretty cool, but I'm running late getting back to the office and I've some pretty important work to do, and these people are obviously not going to be quick getting their order in; thus, I very politely did something out of character for me.\n&gt; Excuse me. I hate to be a bother, but I'm in a bit of a hurry and am just getting one item. Could I pop in front of you? \n\n(I seriously was and am this polite.)\n\nNow, a simple \"no\" would have been sufficient. Instead, Mrs. Bitchy Haircut replies with\n&gt; Well, I hardly see how that's my problem. Maybe you should have got here first. You'll just have to wait your turn.\n\nNow that was bad. But then, the little girl in the gaggle of ankle-biters, probably about four years of age, blonde and obviously doted on quite a bit, raises her finger, points at my face, and stomps her foot in sync with her phrasing\n&gt; Yeah! Wait! Your! Turn!\n\nI'm absofuckinglutely gobsmacked. I wanted to pull her outstretched arm out of her socket and beat her mother with it, but I'm just stunned in place like a salmon that's been brained with a club. Mrs. Bitchy Haircut - who I now am assuming is the mother of this spoiled little twit - tilts her head ever so slightly as if to say \"yeah\" and turns back toward the counter.\n\nAnd how did they order? Well, isn't it always so cute to let your child place their own orders? The stammering, the constant mind-changing, the five second pause after every question the cashier asks? They let every child do this, then placed their own predictably fussy orders (\"I want my fries hot with low salt.\" \"I want to be clear: no pickles!\" \"Does the Calorie Burger come with mayonnaise?\").\n\nI could have walked out, but I was hungry and fuck them. I waited patiently, secretly seething and wanting to give some very late-term abortions, got my order of a single Value Toxic Burger and arrived at my desk ten minutes behind schedule.\n\nTL;DR Predictably cunty woman has predictably cunty child, and they make me late for work.\n\nEdit: grammar.",

Friend 2 and I started taking her to work midday and picking her up around 10pm when she got off.'\n\nOne night, we make a detour to a popular fast food chain that sells cleverly named hot sauces because she hadn't eaten dinner yet. By this point, it's about 12:45-1am because we'd dicked around at her apartment for awhile beforehand. So...technically a little late to be ordering food, but like I said, dicking around.\n\nI pull into the drive-thru, but I pull up a little further so that the speaker's in front of Friend 1's window in the back since Friend 2 and I weren't hungry. We're finishing up a conversation about the menu or something at this point, so I was the only one who heard the girl on the speaker say, \"Hi, how are you?\" We seriously didn't mean to talk over her and did not intentionally mean to ignore her greeting - she just spoke up right as we were still discussing stuff on the menu...\n\nConversation goes on for a couple seconds more, and then this happens:\n\nFriend 1: Hi, I'd like a- \n\nCashier: I'm doing GREAT, THANK YOU FOR ASKING!!! :D :D :D (Think of this spoken in the most caustic way possible.)\n\nWe sat in stunned silence for a full minute.\n\nEventually, Friend 1 ordered, we got our food, and drove off. We did feel pretty bad after that for not responding to her hello, though. We usually aren't those people.\n\nTL;DR: Always return your server's greeting.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to remove the name.",

But then, we had a minor problem when scanning the swede (rutabaga for you Americans out there) - there wasn't a barcode.\n\nSo the swedes come individually wrapped and pre-weighed: there's meant to be a price sticker on them indicating the weight and therefore price. My dad picked the smallest swede which - unbeknownst to either of us - didn't have a label on it. After a couple of minutes of faffing about, a supervisor comes over, checks what the problem is and goes to the fresh produce section to procure another swede of similar size to scan.\n\nMy father notices that said Swede - not the one he's paying for - is marginally bigger than the one he picked out - and therefore more expensive, so he proceeds to not so passively-aggressively complain. He says something along the lines of: \"So this company's ripping me off again; look! That swede is bigger than the one I picked out!\" He continues in this vein for a little while. To be fair, he's not raised his voice, or asked for a manager, but is rather loudly talking about how he's being cheated. Out of, what, maybe five pence. (American terms: 7 or so cents, I guess.)\n\nBeing British, no-one confronted him and we all looked around rather embarrassedly - myself included - because anything more than saying \"sorry\" out of habit in this country is regarded as too much societal interaction. Ah man. Sorry I didn't stand up to him (so to speak).\n\nAnnoyingly he's been in a bad mood for the whole day now.\n\nSigh.\n\n*Edited for clarity.",

I finally flagged someone down and showed them the dead frog. This employee said they would get right on it so I walked off.\n\nI glanced over my shoulder to see the employee walk off in the other direction so I turned back and loitered in one of the aisles nearby. No one really bothered me and I was keeping tabs on the reptile area. No one walked back up. I ended up walking up to yet another employee to ask for a manger and they promptly got one. I told the manager there was a dead frog in the reptile area and he seemed pretty shocked. I watched to make sure someone at least cared before leaving.",

They said that we'd asked for total figures based on three different down payments be sent to our credit union so they can make the loan. The figures were base on either a $1K, $2K, or $3k down payment. We ended up with the $2k down payment.\n\nThey said when the final contract was written, the secretary had erroneously used the $3k numbers instead of the $2k numbers so we'd have to send them $1000. I told them we didn't have it and they said that we'd have to pay them $200 per month for the next five months. I explained that we wouldn't be doing that. The guy was pretty much yelling at me. \n\nFinally I said, \"I have a signed sales contract. It shows how much we agreed to. If your person wrote it wrong, it's not my fault. If you think it's in your best interests, feel free to take us to court. I'll show up with the contract that you signed showing the numbers. I think we both know how it will turn out.

I love self checkout. I use it every single time unless I have more groceries than will fit in the bagging area. I have some produce that I buy at least every other time I come to the store. I don't usually bother to find the tag with the number to punch in, and instead look up produce using the click-on-the-picture system they have. Since these are things I buy a lot, I barely have to look at the screen. Search by picture, vegetables, next screen, second item on the bottom row, enter quantity, done. On to next item.  \n\nFor some reason, the self checkout attendant (SCA) decided to \"help\" me with that yesterday.  \n\n&gt;Me: *[finishes scanning items, moves on to produce, clicks search by picture.]*  \n\n&gt;SCA: Oh, you don't have to do that, you can just type in the number.  \n\n&gt;Me: Oh, I've got it, I'm good, thanks.  \n\n&gt;SCA: No, you need to do it like this. *[reaches across me to go back to the earlier screen to type in the item code. I really don't like her getting in my personal space like this, but I'm still trying to be polite, so I don't say anything.]* Now you just type in the right code. These are called Roma tomatoes *[no shit, I know what I'm buying]* and it's ####.  \n\n&gt;Me: *[reluctantly types in code, hoping she'll go away now.]*  \n\n&gt;SCA: *[pulls my onions out of my cart]* Now these are #### and they're done by weight so you have to place them here....  \n\nShe proceeds to do this with all six or seven types of produce in my cart. To make matters worse, she misidentifies the type of apples I have, and the code she gave me was for a type that was almost twice as much per pound, and I had to actually pull out one with the sticker with the code on it to prove it was wrong, and on one the code she gave me was just completely off. I was buying celery, her code brought up coconuts or something. When she went back to her station to find the right code, I pulled it up as quick as I could through the picture system and was paying by the time she came back. If she hadn't decided to \"help\" I probably would have been loaded up and leaving the parking lot by that time.\n\nTL;DR We're not all morons, so don't help me unless I ask for it.",

The whole process was quick and painless until check out. \n\ncheck out was quick but the bagger, who has literally one job during the transaction, got distracted talking to a nearby coworker. In the end, I loaded my cart myself. \n\nOn one hand, I worked retail for a decade. I work in hospitality. I had a brief secondary call center job. I also had a stint as a pizza delivery guy as a second job. Overall, I am very sympathetic to workers in any related field.  \n\nStill, it really annoyed me to be completely ignored by someone not even attempting to do their job.  I didn't say anything at the time, but if it does happen again I might. I might just not go back, but it's on my side of town. The prices suck but the big retail chain is a bigger hassle to get to. I don't relish going all the way accross town for small quick trips but being ignored is sort of a pet peeve.\n\nedit: as I am still getting the occasional reply I do want to add.  This particular store often gives inferior service. simply put, they tend to hire the youngest employees possible and many of them honestly don't care. Just because I have only mentioned one incident does not mean the store normally provides good service. It is close. it is not cheap and has never had the best service.  For good service, there is another nearby grocery store (a co-op), but it is not open for the hours that work for me. i would go to the mid-ranged store if it were open when I needed it.\n\nAnd fyi, when I mean  the bagger was distracted by conversation I mean she was literally talking through me to talk to her coworker. He showed up late and she started talking to him, instead of bagging my cart of items, with him standing right behind me. i was literally spoken through.  For a second I was really confused when she spoke. It was only when I heard a reply from behind that it made sense. \n",

        "text": "I'm a university student at a college in a small city, and new, smaller version of a popular retail chain went up early last month. We used to go to the bigger versions of the store, but they're approximately 10-15 minutes away. The closer location is on the same road as the school, so it's perfect for late-night grocery runs.\n\nMy friends and I went for a quick trip one evening, bought a few items, and went to the registers. The funny thing about this particular location is that they usually have no more than three registers open, no matter how many people are in the store. It's pretty typical of that chain, but in such a small store where people's shopping trips are usually completed in under 30 minutes, you get some pretty long lines. The place isn't in any way understaffed, either, given the amount of students (and adults) who pounced on those jobs the moment the store opened.\n\nWe opted for self checkout that night, because the other lines were long as usual. Friend 1 scans her stuff first, and gets the 'approval needed' screen for her six pack of beer. No problem, just flag down a cashier for the code, right?\n\nYeah, no.\n\nThere's four self checkout lanes. One was down and another was being used, so that left ours and the one next to us. A woman with a kid is waiting at the other one for the 'approval needed' code, so with us, that's two self checkout lanes held up because we're waiting for a cashier to come by. The woman with the kid is, unfortunately, using the glitchy one that likes to demand approval for random non-alcoholic or non-dangerous items (we've had it demand approval for mini burgers before).\n\nWe stand there for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, with neither us nor the woman receiving any help. There's only one other nearby SA that isn't working the busy registers, and she's happily chatting it up with a customer. A couple of other SA's eventually come slowly by, but I guess none of them have the authorization to enter the necessary codes (not entirely sure how it works) because none of them take any notice of us. \n\nFinally, an older lady rushes up to the registers and enters codes for both of us, ending the holdup. \n\nI really, really don't like being *that* customer, and we didn't yell or anything - Friend 2 left us with the groceries to walk around a short distance to see if anyone was nearby. We tend to run into this problem every time we go there, and I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth the convenience of being 5 minutes away. ",

It was early, and the store wasn't crowded, so there was one contractor checkout open as well as 4 self check outs. I'm about to check out when I spy her.\n\nThis woman. This middle-aged, suburban white woman, with tacky, overpriced jewelry that only the tasteless affluent can afford, is in the middle of a bitch fit. I wheel my cart closer to see why she's berating these two hapless employees, because I know this type of woman, and I've worked for far too long in retail not to.\n\n\"...I don't want to walk all the way down there! Why don't you have more check outs open?!\" She nags sharply, clutching all of two items in her arms.\n\nI stare blankly at the four open self checkouts in from of her.\n\n\"Well ma'am, the self checkout attendant would be more than happy to help you check out right here,\" One of the young sales associates responds, with tortured patience.\n\n\"This is *self checkout*. What do you mean she can help me? It says *SELF CHECKOUT*.\"\n\nBy now my jaw is firmly planted on the floor while I observe the spectacle she's making. I'm shocked she's not foaming at the mouth.\n\n\"I know ma'am, but the attendant there can help scan things and bag them for you -\"\n\n\"Well it's not clearly marked that way, is it?! Why isn't it marked? This is ridiculous. Where's your manager?!\"\n\nNo. No fucking \"let me speak to your supervisor\", not for this, not on my watch.\n\nI pull closer, look her dead in the eye. \"Believe it or not, these employees don't choose which registers to open, or design the store layout. They're trying to help you, and you're being an absolute *cunt* for no reason. I don't know where you get your sense of entitlement, but there's no reason to be so mean.\"\n\nReveling in the adrenaline, I stare her down until she walks away without another word. One of the sales associates barely inclines her head in thanks.\n\nIt felt so good. I feel like I was yelling at every past fucknugget who made my day hell for no reason. I'm pretty sure I only lashed out like that because I was super sleep deprived but, well... I may have to make a habit of it.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I said that that was unacceptable and I was growing very agitated.\n\nHe said he would transfer me to a manager.\n\n10 more minutes and I'm connected with somebody else who turned out to not be a manager. I started from the beginning for a third time. \n\nThis time once I got to the matter about the price of this small piece of plastic that is necessary to operate the dryer, I explained to the gentleman that this is a case of the manufacturers planned obsolescence. I said this is price-gouging at its finest and that I know it only costs the company pennies to manufacture this particular part. I also told home what I had endured on the phone during the last 30 minutes and that if something significant isn't done I will never buy a product from them ever again.\n\nI was placed on hold for 5 minutes. The guy came back and said as a courtesy the company will send me the piece at no charge, it should be there within 4 business days.\n\nDo you think I handled this situation well? Poorly?",

I've had situations where people who approached me from behind would address me as \"ma'am\" or something similar. I was usually never bothered by this when it would happen, as they usually apologized or showed some humility. I had long hair (and I was a total girl about my hair, too, anyways).\n\nOne evening, my SO and I went out to dinner, and our server approached us from behind me and addressed us as \"ladies\". My SO laughed (since it wasn't the first time, and it is kind of funny when it happens) and the server responds, \"oops,\" and laughs a little bit before proceeding to take our order. I could tell quickly by her attitude that she seemed less than enthused to be there. I noticed that she didn't write down our orders, which is fine if you have a good enough memory to remember what your customers order. But when our food finally came out, portions of the requests we made to our orders were wrong. Now, I don't always hold servers accountable for this, because often times it can be lazy cooks. But the server walked away as my SO was trying to explain to her about something that she asked for and didn't get, plus I was going to request a drink refill and didn't get the chance to. It took her a long time to come back around, and even though at that point I asked for a refill, she never gave me one. I eventually had to go to the bar and ask for it. We had finished been finished eating for about 15 minutes before she finally came around. She just handed us the check, grabbed our plates and walked away. Not asking us if we wanted dessert, not asking us how the meal was, and not asking us if we wanted refills on our empty drinks.\n\nNow, I like to think I'm a reasonable person. If the restaurant was packed, or she had a big party she had to attend to that was taking a significant amount of her time, or even causing her frustration, I would've understood. But the place was mostly dead since it was an hour before close on a week night. The vast majority of the time she wasn't in sight at all. 10 minutes from the time she handed us our check, I finally had enough and walked up to another server and explained I've been waiting for ours to run my card so I could sign it and leave and have no clue where she is. So he made the effort to find her for me and do it. She comes back with the receipt and a pen, says \"Thanks\" with a half smile and walks off. No apology for making us wait so long that we had to ask someone else about it.\n\nI typically tip anywhere from 20-25%, even if the service is kind of mediocre - or I'll tip a good flat amount if I'm coming in somewhere with other people and just want a drink. When the service is this bad, I either don't tip at all, or I round up to the nearest dollar (which is what I did in this situation), and I write a note on the back of the receipt explaining why the tip was the way it was.",

It was going in an old Pentium 4 tower, so it had a fairly healthy overhead.\n\nSo, I take it home, and open up the box. What am I greeted with? Well, a 250W PSU. With fewer connectors than were advertised on the box, and a completely different brand!\n\nA couple of days later, I went back to $UKComputerRetailer to see what on earth was going on.

Another employee must've then taken it out of the bin, put it in a random box, and then put it on a store shelf. I have no idea if the power supply was actually any good or not... but to this day, it is the most bizarre thing that's ever happened to me in a shop.\n\nAs this was the last 305W power supply, I was given a discount on a 300W PSU, which actually was what it was supposed to be.\n\nTL;DR: Guy puts power supply in bin, guy 2 takes it out and puts it on sale.",

        "text": "So my friend and I decided to visit a mega furniture store  known for inexpensive furniture.\n\nI should preface with that my friend is very talkative and generally a happy person. She strikes up conversation with everyone.\n\nWe took off apart from each other and eventually she called me to let me know she was getting ready to check out. I went ahead and took my time through the showroom while heading to the cash register. I saw her and joined her line, with only one customer between her and I. \n\nI saw her making conversation, as usual, taking her time putting money back into her purse that many people do (so annoying). But whatever. The next customer quickly shoved her stuff to the cashier to ring her up. \n\nThen I am next. Before I could tell him that the bag I had was purchased the day prior, he got into the store phone and called a co-worker, who was also at the registerd, to tell him/her that \"dude.that girl I was telling you about that visits all the time was just here,\" followed by a laugh.\n\nNow. He could've been talking about the woman between my friend and I. Chances are slim though.\n\nCan she be annoyingly talkative? Yes. Does she not notice when people are giving social cues? Yes.\n\nI just think it's very rude to not take customer gossip to the break room or until after hours. \n\nHe eventually asked me if I was going to pay for my bag, so I said \"no. My blonde friend you were talking about on the phone paid for it the other day. Remember? You checked us out. I asked you if it was okay to bring the bag back into the store.\" He immediately said \"oh yeah. I remember you now\" with a straight face. He wasn't laughing anymore.\n\nI told my friend and she talked to a manager about it. But from a distance, all I could see was the manager smiling. She said that the manager couldn't stop smiling, like she thought it was funny.\n\nSo the manager's reaction makes me think that they made my friend into a small butt of jokes for the moment. Even if they were sharing another \"crazy\" customer story, as long as the customer isn't causing a scene, is calm and collected, I think management should at the very least pretend to take a complaint serious. Hell, there have been times when my store manager's have been very concerned talking to customer, then immediately laugh when she hangs up the phone. \n\nI feel bad for her, nfl. If you gonna be a D, be a professional one. ☝",

        "text": "Well here we go again.. see the first post listed in the letter if you need to catch up\n\n&gt;\nHello again, I am the same writer of this letter from about a year back: http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/1rtjrh/a_letter_to_mccrap/\n&gt; \nI’ll be publishing this one as well because I believe in the right of people to know about corporations and their response to feedback. I will begin on a positive note (which is a bit difficult to do right now) and tell you that my feedback from prior has been taken into consideration and the store seems to be doing better. I try to check in on it from time to time and have had much less issues with it. On the other side of that, my friend took it upon himself to write you a letter as well and he got a response… while I did not. Just because I said I didn’t want promo cards or a formal apology letter doesn’t mean that I don’t want a response at all. Just a “Thank you for your feedback, we will investigate the situation and take appropriate actions” would have been appreciated and maybe (if your feedback system could allow it) a response once the issue had been addressed so that I knew I could stop going out of my way to avoid it.\n&gt; \nSo this time it is a different store. Store number ---- located on --------------- in TH. I wish I could say that tonight was the only occurrence of issues with this location, but I cannot so I will address that first. About 4-6 months ago my wife went to go get some food for us because I was not feeling well. It was a DQP dressed like a Big Mac just like last year and the exact same thing happened… one patty instead of two. So we found out when she got back that they had messed the sandwich up and were debating whether or not it was worth going back to get it fixed and she decided it was. She went back and talked to a manager at the counter (one whose name we did not know then, but now know as “-----” the shift manager) and asked her to fix it. Unfortunately ----- had a very rude attitude with her and did not seem sympathetic at all with the situation. If I remember correctly, there was very little verbal conversing... she just took the sandwich away from her, took an order, and then put the sandwich in front of my wife and gave a rather insincere “Have a nice day.” I also wish I could say that was the end of the issue, but after walking out the door that night she was addressed by a (still unknown) male employee standing outside the door. Again, I am blanking on what the conversation was, but she described the situation as very uncomfortable and unsafe feeling. I did not write a letter about this because of the distinct lack of information to give, but my wife did fill out a survey about it with the url on the top of the receipt (which I no longer have).\n&gt;\nSince this incident I have only visited this location a couple of times. Once was a week ago and I picked up a Classic Pack (2 QP, 2 10 Piece Nuggets, 2 MD Fries) and ordered it word for word the way I did today with exception of the words “and add bacon to them”. Honestly… I’m pretty sure it was the same person ringing it up too. So last week she rang up my “dressed like a Big Mac” correctly and I even had a fun little conversation with the guy at window 2 who double checked my sandwiches for me. Swell guy, but didn’t catch a name. This week she rang it up correctly with exception of adding extra cheese. When I asked her to take it off, she did… but she also removed the “plain” at the end of the sandwich (which is her way of saying “only” it seems) and I didn’t notice until after had gotten the food upon looking at the receipt.\n&gt; \nSo I hate to say it, but I’ve remembered the first incident both times that I visited that location and today was no exception. When I walked in, I was actually was looking for the lady that matched my wife’s description and when I walked through the door, there she was standing… actually kind of glaring at me as I walked in with my sandwiches. The closer I walked to her, the more her face actually became what seemed… angrier. When I finally got to the counter I sat down the sandwiches (and my sauces… I asked for buffalo, buffalo was rung up, and I got BBQ) and with the most unpleasant reaction I have ever received from a food service organization said, “What’s wrong!?” as if I was the biggest inconvenience for her. At this point with her mistreatment of my wife and myself, I was about done with her but I held my composure. “I asked for them to be dressed like Big Macs and add bacon... and they have ketchup and mustard on them”.\n&gt;\nAlmost as if she knew I was going to come in, she immediately replied, “That’s how you ordered them” as she pointed at the grill slips. That was it, I couldn’t handle it anymore and I became a little distraught. “That is not how I ordered it, I ordered it dressed like a Big Mac with bacon”. She repeated, “That’s how you ordered them.” I repeated, “That is NOT how I ordered it, I ordered it dressed like a Big Mac with bacon… I let her ring it up however she preferred.” She then said the most perplexing thing I have ever heard, “Well you should have told her exactly how you wanted it. How is she supposed to know what is on the sandwich?” At this point I lost hope in -----… Does she really not expect her employees to know what are on the sandwiches? So I asked, “Isn’t that part of her job to know that?” And she said (as if she was implying the employee was stupid and incompetent), “Her job is to take orders and take money. That is all.” At this point I was beyond over her and I asked “So if I asked her what was on a certain sandwich because I was allergic to something… she couldn’t tell me?” and she did not reply… rung up my sandwiches “add bacon, Ask me” and moved on to the next customer (she actually rang up one as a DQP). She finished with the customer and brought my sandwiches over noticing that she forgot the sauces, threw them in and threw the bag down and let out another insincere “Have a nice day.” which was identical to what my wife described.\n&gt;\nHonestly this experience has ruined this location for me completely… and there are probably countless others who feel the same way but don’t know how to address it. This location is ruining the golden arches’ name and it’s saddening. I would like some response this time one way or another… and I would honestly very much appreciate a sincere apology to my wife and I from this rude manager.\n&gt;\nI hope your day is going much better than mine has gone and I appreciate your time reading and addressing this. I know that this is not the way that a restaurant should be ran and that is why I am taking time of out my evening to write this for you.  I look forward to hearing back from you and seeing this restaurant getting back up on its feet.\n&gt;\nThank you!\n\n\nEdit: Good news friends. I heard back from the fill-in GM (The GM is on Vacation) and they discussed the issue at length with me and confirmed that the way I experienced their store is not the way it should be going. The temporary action is that I will be receiving a duplicate of my order free of charge/inspected by a manager as well as their will be an investigation into the situation. Additionally when the GM gets back, they will be talking with me about the situation as well. ",

        "text": "So - I'm not totally sure I'm not the asshole here, but am feeling that I need to vent. I work marketing for a small company, they want a car wrap. I make a sketch of what the owner wants, we hire a designer, the designer sends the proofs asking for feedback. Designer proofs are radically different from the sketch (done in Visio) and the logo is wrong. Like, the wrong name is on it. We get that sorted out immediately (although no new proof has been sent...now I'm not expecting one and am scared to ask) but it's not over yet. I'm feeling like we just started, and I don't want this dance.\n\n\nSo: I don't like the font that the designer has chosen &amp; ask for it to be changed, saying I'd like a font like (common font). I apologise. I acknowledge that it's a boring font. I kind of explain why the opinion, but I guess not very well (this is all over email). Basically, designer used 3 different versions of the same font (I disagree but designer asserts, they all look different as heck to me) plus some italics. I discuss with boss &amp; coworkers, everyone agrees that they're not that readable, especially for something going on a car (i.e., can you read it at 25mph? probably not).\n\n\nThere are also a few small copy/content changes - delete a phrase, just put the phone number on the door, simple stuff. \n\n\nDesigner writes back (verbatim, so I guess I'm really in for it if I get caught):\n\"What are you saying? I NEVER design anything using (font) or (font), they are common and ordinary and not worth someone paying a designer. I used only 1 font all the way through this job except for matching the (font) on the logo. Why do I feel like I need to defend myself when all I wanted to do was find out what goes on the (part) of the car, which I still don’t know the answer to? What do I do next?\"\n\n\nI'm writing back now trying to keep it tidy, but I want to say: *I don't know! Do what I asked?!!* My email clearly stated (in a bulleted point, no less) what to put on the car part asked about. The font that designer \"matched\" was a serif font matched with a sans serif font. Getting the logo wrong initially and changing everything else on the sketch is just icing.\n\n\nIs it normal for designers to refuse to work with clients on something like this?  Does picking a font make you a designer, or less of a designer? Sorry, this turned from a tale to a question, but I'm writing back to the designer now (clearly..) trying to figure out what the heck to do. Designer did not (of course?) copy my boss on this last email. I will, of course, copy boss on my response (just as I did on the original feedback sent). Lawdy. Thanks for reading! Throwaway, obv.!\n\n\n***update*** You are all bang on, designer is going, going, gone. Phew! As a poster said below, we probably don't need a designer at all for this job (so hopefully boss won't hire one without checking, next time. Not holding my breath). Cheers!! ",

        "text": "So, the other day I went to eat at a popular African themed restaurant with some friends. They serve international styled food, and it's usually kindof a miss.\n\nThis visit though, was just too many misses. First thing was we got sat down and a waitress takes our drink order. One person ordered a Sprite after asking if the restaurant had Coke or Pepsi products. So of course, when the waitress brought the drinks, she brought him Coke instead. Well, he was busy attending to the small child and didn't see her put the drink down. When he did she was already at the other end of the restaurant. And there were no other waiters to be seen.\n\n10 minutes later we get the attention of a waitress (seems the first one left for the day), and get the drink changed. We then order our food. The same person orders a chicken Jumbalaya meal. When the food comes out, he gets Kung Pao Chicken. We get that changed back to the original order, which is delivered by the Manager. We have been nothing but polite this entire time, telling them the food was good, when in actuality it was pretty, eh. \n\nI had Mongolian Beef which was advertized as wok fried with hot chili peppers. Which you would think would be spicy right? No. The dried peppers had not opened in the cooking process so it was just sweet with unopened peppers sitting in the sickly salty sweet sauce. But, that's not their fault. I should have known better than to order something with possible spice at this restaurant.\n\nNow the third strike I didn't notice until this morning (monday. I ate there saturday evening). We had ended up splitting the check. I paid for my one dish (I drank water). My friends paid for their two dishes, appetizer, and drinks. I looked at my credit card statement this morning to see that I was billed for both my meal, and their meal. But each one without the tips that we had written in.\n\nCalled the credit card company to dispute, and I'm waiting for the restaurant to open to let them know that people are really messing up there. I actually tipped well for that shit service, because I always tip that much if I go out ($5 on a $15 bill), but I hope they don't bill me for that tip anymore as they obviously don't deserve it now... Ugh. Check your statements when you split checks, as you may never know what happened.",

They had a promotion going on where if you traded a copy of GTAV for ps3 you could get the PS4 copy for half price. Amazing since I was planning on getting it anyway. However the department running it, was separate from the actual store, lets call them T-mo. \n\nI walk up to the T-mo desk and i'm approached by a red shirt who tells me they are on lunch and will return in 30 minutes. No problem my and my SO have a small bit of shopping to do.\n\n We return 30 minutes later and T-mo representative is helping a man, a woman, and two teens (age ~18-19). After 5 minutes the T-mo representative looks over to me and says \"I'll be right with you\". Fast forward 45 MINUTES of me standing in front of her and not a single word has been said to me. At this point a small crowd of about 5-6 people have gathered obviously looking for the same promotion as they had their game copies in hand. At this point I'm furious (God bless my SO for keeping her cool for so long) The man who the T-mo rep has been talking to for +45 minutes walks over to me and says:\n&gt;Man: \"Do you need something?\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \" Yes I was here for the GTAV promotion going on\"\n\n&gt;Man: \"Oh let me see if I can get her to help you out\"\n\nHe walks over to the girl at the desk and says that she should help us out since we have been waiting so long. A random crowd member very passively aggressively says:\n\n&gt;RCM: \"I have been waiting here half an hour and you haven't even acknowledged me. Haven't you noticed the other 5 people staring a hole into the side of your head?\n\nShe mutters out an apology and takes his copy before mine. At this point whatever at least it's getting done. \n\nWant to know what really made me see red? She calls over a regular red shirt and he takes my copy of the game and gets everything processed in 2 minutes. I wanted to explode if my SO hadn't been there I would have yelled till security kicked me out. We finish the transaction and we start heading out, but not before filing a complaint. My SO and I walk over to the customer service desk and ask the regular red shirt employee CSR:\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry but I need to file a complaint I have had a terrible experience. Who is the manager of your T-mo department?\n\n&gt;CSR: I'm very sorry to hear that let me check ~clicks away at a computer~ Oh it's Michael. \n\n&gt;Me: Can you get Michael to come up here? \n\n&gt;CSR: I'm sorry he is out for the night. \n\n&gt;Me: Okay can I have a number where I might reach him tomorrow?\n\n&gt;CSR: i'm sorry I don't have one. \n\nAt this point im seething. nothing anyone could tell me would be able to make this better, so I decided to leave. I told the CSR Rep thanks for nothing and just left. \n\nMy SO contacted corporate right away and let me speak to them, they were very apologetic and said they knew who was working the T-mo desk and would speak to them immediately. Although I never heard anything back so I doubt anything was done. \n\nTL;DR Bitch representative makes me wait 45 minutes to do a simple 2 minute transaction. Customer service is lazy and unhelpful.

        "text": "So last year I moved to a new city and into a new flat by myself and this happened within a month or so of moving in. I'm working pretty long hours and living far away from any big supermarkets so, as I'm not able to drive, I like to have my grocery shopping delivered. \n\nSo one evening I get home from work and I'm super-tired but I have a bunch of housework to do and I'm waiting for my shopping from a certain big supermarket to be delivered. I'm in the middle of washing up when there's a knock on my front door and my shopping's arrived. \n\nJust to explain the layout of my flat: The front door opens straight into the living room/bedroom and then to the right there's a door through to the kitchen and then a door to the bathroom directly in front of it. \n\nSo I take my shopping through to the kitchen, sign for my stuff and the driver leaves. I put my shopping away and go back to washing up when there's another knock on my door and delivery guy is back.\n\n&gt;'Hey I'm sorry but can I use your bathroom please? It's a long drive to my next drop off?'\n\nHe seems nice enough so I point him through to my bathroom and go back to my washing up. Anyway, he finishes up in the bathroom and comes out and instead of just leaving he stands in my kitchen doorway blocking any way out of the flat. And then starts asking me all these questions:\n\n&gt; So how old are you?\n&gt; How long have you lived here?\n&gt; Do you live alone?\n&gt; Do you have a boyfriend?\n\nAnd at this point I'm starting to get a little freaked out so I make up some rubbish about how my boyfriend is going to be coming over soon but he doesn't seem to want to leave. At this point he starts walking closer to me while still blocking my way out so I'm feeling kind of trapped in my kitchen and getting a little scared and I realise I've left my phone out in the living room. \n\nHe keeps going:\n\n&gt; How long have you been with your boyfriend?\n&gt; You know you're really pretty\n&gt; I wish you were single\n&gt; I'd like to ask you out\n&gt; I'd ask you out if you were single\n&gt; Are you sure you're happy with your boyfriend?\n&gt; I just want you to know I think you're very attractive\n\nI tell him I'm flattered and thank him but I'm very happy with my boyfriend (true) and he's definitely going to be here soon (not true). He starts edging towards me again and I'm backing up into the kitchen, overcome with panic - I'm a 21 year old woman and absolutely tiny - this man is like twice the size of me, I'm completely alone and have no idea what to do so I start fumbling around looking for a knife because it's the only thing I can think to do.\n\nLuckily at that moment my neighbours car happened to pull up into our shared driveway and I told him that was probably my boyfriend here at which point he finally left (rather quickly). I immediately locked my door behind him and ended up bursting into tears. I phoned the supermarket to complain but I don't know if anything was ever done. \n\nLooking back it might not sound so scary but I was completely terrified, especially knowing I was completely alone. \n\nTLDR: Ordered shopping online, delivery man hit on me and wouldn't leave my house and backed me into my kitchen with no way out.",

You are going to leave me a tip, aren't you?\" Not in a friendly, I'm trying to educate you way, but in about as snarky a tone as she can muster.\n\nHonestly, I was speechless.

        "text": "This happened to me over the weekend but I didn't know this sub existed until now. I have posted in talesfromretail and talesfromsecurity before though.\n\nBasically, I bought 2,000+ dvds and games from a seller on eBay in the north of England. I have bought from this seller before so I was quite happy with goods I previously bought from him. I usually sort through them all and after removing any scratched discs and worthless titles, I end up with roughly 1/3rd of what I paid for to be re sellable. The rest I give away on Freecycle or to charity shops (thrift stores).\n\nSo the seller has about 15 large boxes of stock - almost twice what I usually buy. \nI usually have UPS ship them down for about £70 for 8 boxes. But because of the larger number in this consignment, I thought it would be cheaper to list the job on one of these van driver auction sites - like the one on shipping wars but *not* that site.\n\nSo the bids come in and the best - but note quite the cheapest was £71. He was new to the site but had 4 positive feedback and was fully insured etc.\n\nSo I accept the bid and paid the deposit. I contacted the driver and we arranged a 2 hour time window in the late afternoon the next day when he could pick the boxes up. I wasn't too bothered about delivery and told him that if he preferred to drop them off the next day, that was fine by me - 350 mile trip and all...\n\nSo on the collection day, I get a call from my ebay seller. He wants to know when the driver will be there. There's still 30 minutes left in the time window so I give him a call. No answer. So I leave a message and ask him to let me know when he will be at the address. No big deal. Traffic? Unexpected delay? Could be any number of things. I'm at work at the time so I just put it to the back of my mind.\n\n4 hours later and I get another call from my eBay seller. My delivery driver still hasn't arrived. I'm quite angry by now because he hasn't even returned my call.\n\nSo I call him again and he says he will be there in 10 minutes. Ok, unprofessional but at least he's cheap.\n\nAnother 45 minutes and a third call from my ebay seller. He still isn't there.\n\nSo I text him to ask where he is. Apparently he said there was nobody in. Complete rubbish. So I ask him to go back because I know the seller is there. He agrees by text that he will go back in an hour. I relay this to the seller. I then ask how far away he is. He texts back that he is 80 miles away and will have to do it tomorrow because it's now too late.\n\nWhat happened to going back in an hour?\nNever mind. I'm tired, I'm hungry and I'm in my way home from work. After dinner, I ask him what time he will collect them tomorrow. He can't give me any time frame what so ever.\n\nI'm sick of this now. I tell him to cancel the job and I will find somebody else to do it. So I relist the job and I have to pay £110 but at least I will get it done.\n\nThe next morning, my seller informs me that the parcels were collected by van driver number 2. Fantastic. Later that day, they are dropped off at my home by two very friendly guys who are shocked when I tell them about the trouble I had to start with.\nI then leave a negative review on van driver 1's profile. I keep it factual with no opinions or warnings to other members.\n\nEnd of story? I wish!\n\nSo the next day - 48 hours after I last had contact with van driver number 1 - I get a phone call from him. The first thing he says in a slurred, drunk voice is\n\n**\"Wot you doin' postin all that shit 'bout me on the net?\"**\n\nSo I explain that I want nothing to do with him and that our business is concluded. I then end the call. \n\nOver the next hour he sends numerous threatening texts telling me we can \"Sort it out together\" (fight?) and that \"this ain't over yet\". \n\nBy now I am both angry and scared. This guy has my address and he sounds like a drunk and like a complete nut case. \n\nSo I call the customer service number for the site. I explained everything to them and after sending them screen shots of the threatening text messages to them, they tell me that they have blocked his account because even questioning members over feedback they have left, let alone threatening them about it is completely against their policies. They are very apologetic and are really helpful and advised me to call the police if I felt threatened by him. \n\nWell I live in a very secure apartment complex with an intercom and neighbours very close by so the threat from him wasn't an immediate risk.\n\nIt's been almost 3 days since he last contacted me so for now I will assume they were just empty threats he made after seeing a negative comment on his account.\n\nIn conclusion, I never expected to end up with such an idiot to be on a professional site like that, but van driver 2 was absolutely amazing and very helpful - his colleague even let me know when he was held up in traffic a few miles down the road and that he would be a few minutes late. What a great couple of guys!\n\nAs for the software? I was able to pull out just over 1,000 resalable discs, about 150 were beyond repair so I just kept the cases and the other 800+ will be on freecycle soon.",

But whatever, who cares about $3?\nHe then gave me a lecture about \"You should really be outside waiting for your pizza it's a public holiday it's just selfish for you to take so long.\"\n\nHe pulled up and just as I got to the door he started honking. He called me selfish. Plus he took an hour and a half and our food was cold. So I should just wait outside that whole time waiting eagerly for you to get my pizza? I get where you're coming from, but I took barely a minute to get outside and you were already honking.\nScrew you man.",

        "text": "On Saturday my entire extended family (15 of us) got together for our annual meal honoring my mothers parents anniversary. This year my grandmother decided she wanted to go to another restaurant, we had been going to the same place for the past 10 years. The other place in question is german themed and so is this new place.\n\nSo we all get there and we had never been, just looked at reviews online that said the place was good. Place was ok, wasnt in a very nice part of town but seemed decent enough. Cant judge a book by its cover sorta thing.\n\nSo once we are all there we order and most of the plates we get are around $15-$25. We order appetizers as well for $10 ea (4 of them). For whatever reason there is only one waitress and she is working ok, not checking as often as i felt she should (many of us asked for drink refills and had to flag her down, but she was alone and it was a decently busy dining room (approx 10 tables).\n\nFood comes, wasnt anything to really write home about but it was good. No issues there. Portions were rather small we felt compared to the other restaurant but hey were here and thats that. \n\nOverall service was ok, no real issues. My parents gathered up money from all of us and my mom counted it out and paid. She paid cash b/c she knows they get to keep every penny vs credit cards. The bill was $500. As we are leaving we presume the owner came up and said in a very rude tone \"X name doesnt work for free!\" and he throws the bill and money at my mother (literally). My mom trys to ask whats the matter (maybe she miscounted the money??) but the owner runs off into the kitchen. What happened was she miscounted $100 and didnt tip the waitress (brought the total to $600). Now in reality it was seriously an honest mistake. But we all felt the owner handled it horribly. he could have just said politely \"I think you made a mistake\" or \"I think you should recount this\" Instead he was so nasty we were all shocked. I understand they thought we were going to stiff them on the tip. There was nothing on the bill indicating gratuity was part of it either. \n\nIm just shocked how the owner handled it all. My father managed restaurants in the 70's and 80's and remarked he would have never handled it like that. He begged my mother to go back and allow him to talk to the owner (I think he was gonna yell at him) but mom dragged him off.\n\n**UPDATE:** Since we had reserved several tables, the restaurant had my mothers phone number. The owner called today and profusely apologized. I still dont think we would ever go back..",

In the middle of the reptile display was a young veiled chameleon, he must have been only a year or two old.\n\nThis was the most pitiful chameleon I've ever seen. He was far too pale, shivering, and you could see veins pumping frantically through his skin. His cage was about the size of a 10 gallon fishtank -approximately 1/3rd the size it should have been. Having owned a chameleon myself for several years, I could tell he was terrified, stressed, and quite ill.\n\nI grabbed the attention of a passing associate, and gently pointed out what was wrong with the chameleon. To my great surprise, he not only cared, but listened to my recommendations to help the poor thing. Even more surprising, while I was looking for what I came there to purchase, I noticed that he called another associate over and they were really taking care of the chameleon!\n\nI was so happy to know that employee actually cared. He told me he was going to put him in a larger cage in the back of the store so he would be less stressed, and raise the humidity level in his cage as well. I hope the little thing is ok now, and the employees have looked up how to take better care of their reptiles. \n\n**Edit:** Thanks so much for the gold, whoever you are!

It is not unusual for some of the wealthy entitled to think their poop doesn't smell. Not many, but just enough to give our town a reputation.\n\nThis happened the other day at my local supermarket. It was  the day after we got an 8 inch snow storm, so it was a little busier than usual. All the open registers have lines, but one or two deep. I get in line by an older woman, around 60, and I assume her daughter. The older sees me get in line behind her and continues standing there, occasionally looking around. I understand, there is only so much excitement you can get looking at the racks and what not.\n\nNow before I continue, when I worked in a supermarket as a cashier during school, it wasn't uncommon for shoppers to leave their cart on line while finishing shopping. Annoying to other customers, but there was nothing I could do if the first customer told me they'd be right back. The ones who left and dashed would sometimes be out of luck as I could honestly tell the next customer that I didn't know anything about the cart, but I digress. Back to mom. \n\nAfter a minute or two her \"daughter\" has finished unloading and there is room for me to unload so I ask mom to excuse me so I can start unloading. That is when she finally decides to mention that the woman in front of her was a stranger and she was waiting for her daughter, who still wasn't there, and was going to continue to hold her place in line.\n\nNow if she had told me when I got behind her, I might have grumbled but moved over to another line. But no, she decided her time was more valuable than mine (even though I was shopping during my lunch hour on my telecommute day) and didn't bother to warn me. Sadly this type of inconsideration to others is not too uncommon, but the audacity of not even bothering to warn me sent me over the edge.\n\nI don't usually flip out, but it just pissed me off. \"No! No! No,\" I told her. \"You don't let me stand in line for a few minutes and then tell me an extra cart of groceries is about to cut in front of me!\" I don't know if it was the veins popping out of my head or the fact that someone stood up to her, but she backed down and \"let me\" get in front of her. \n\nVictory was mine. I put a selfish a-hole in her place, which in my area can be like shooting fish in a barrel. It was just satisfying. And then it happened. \n\nTurned out the line I was on needed a price check and mom, and her real daughter, now on the adjoining line, were able to check out before the cashier even started my order so I ended up doing them a favor. Sigh. My sushi didn't taste as good after that.\n\nTL;TR: Defeat snatched from the jaws of victory",

To celebrate his return to the land of the chewing, I asked him to pick a place that had food he could eat for our date night. He suggested a diner we like, though we haven't patronized it in six months or so. \n\nWe were told there would be a 15 minute wait, which was fine, since it was a busy Saturday night. Five minutes later, we were seated at a booth by the bar. Not my favorite spot there, since the blender can get loud, but we were hungry. \n\nThe place was busy, and we waited about 15 minutes to be greeted. We watched the tables on either side get their entrees, and the server (...Bob, we'll call him) just took our drink order without asking if we were ready to order food too. I was a little annoyed, but we were having a nice conversation, so it wasn't that big of a deal.\n\nAfter we got our drinks, I ordered my regular (this amazing breakfast burrito with eggs, sausage, peppers, and green chili) and my husband asked for a chili burger with chili tater tots as the side. \n\nLike five minutes later, Bob brought a plate of chili fries. My husband wasn't inclined to say anything, but I mentioned that I thought that was supposed to come with his meal, and it was supposed to be tater tots, not fries. \n\nBob said something like \"Yes. You're totally right. I entered it wrong. I'm sorry, I'll make sure it's right with his burger.\" He left us the fries to munch on while our entrees were being prepared.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Bob approaches our table with a plate of chili tater tots. \"I don't know why this didn't come with his burger, but here!\"\n\nOkee. \n\nNot five minutes later, out came our entrees. My husband's burger was right, my burrito was divine. We were relatively happy. We enjoyed our date and asked for a box for all the extra chili-laden carbs for my husband to eat for the next couple of days. \n\nBob delivered the check, and ran off for the box. My husband picked up the check and looked horribly confused.  I assumed somehow we'd gotten charged for the fries AND tots and that something had gone horribly wrong.\n\n[Here's the check.](http://i.imgur.com/RU6fA4E.jpg)\n\nWe asked if it was the wrong check, but Bob said no. He was sorry he'd taken so long to greet us, and with the order mix-up and since we'd been so kind, he wanted to comp dinner for us. \n\nMy husband went up to the cashier to pay, and I gave Bob a $20. And then spent the drive home trying to figure out what percentage of a $0.01 check that was.\n\nEDIT: Holy moly, thanks for the gold! :) ",

I never really figured out what it was, but the looks on their faces said he had been there a while. He wasn't being abusive but he was clearly upset and frustrated. They just stood there and would occasionally just say something like \"I'm sorry sir, but I can't do that.\"\n\nI waited quite a while and he just wouldn't stop. He apparently thought that if he was enough of a gadfly that he would get what he wanted. I realized I was going to be there for hours if I didn't intervene.\n\nI finally interrupted him and said, \"You realize you're asking her to lose her job.\" He just looked at me as though stunned for a few seconds and stormed out. I guess he finally realized that no matter how much of a pain he was, he wasn't going to be enough of a pain to make her decide to give him whatever to make him just go away.\n\nSadly, they didn't even say \"Thank you\" to me. Probably some policy requiring them to say as little as possible.",

By now I'm paying attention, I was a cashier for several years, and I hate people like that. The head cashier walks up and said, 'cashier, we were restocked today' and asshole said, 'told you so.' I loudly claim 'that was rude!' And the cashier looked at me with surprise, and I said, 'oh no, not you.' I saw the man child tense up, but he never looked at me.\n\nWhen he was gone, the cashier apologized to me, I told her it was unnecessary, and I hoped she didn't have to deal with anymore assholes.

In fact in some cases (Master-Card and Visa) policy state that a retailer is not allowed to refuse cards based on lack of ID - And while the intent is to protect themselves (If you wind up disputing a charge on a card someone used that was stolen, the store still loses that money) But at the same time I don't personally think that it's reasonable to expect someone to cough up ID just because one person out of hundreds MAY be a thief.\n\nIn the end I wound up having cash and payed that way, but I just seemed slightly miffed about being told that there was a store policy about requiring ID that I had never heard of at that store before, and one that upon research goes against the network's policy\n\nI guess I'm asking, is this a reasonable thing to require?\n(I recently lost my wallet on and hadn't got my replacement ID at the time I made this purchase)\n",

        "text": "Backstory: In June of last year, my hairstylist (who I have known since I was a small child, she used to be my aunt's best friend in high school-we'll call her R) called me and asked if I wanted to have my picture taken so she could hang the photos in her salon. She hired a photographer couple to take our pictures after she styled our hair. After the shoot, R promises to send us free CDs of our pictures. All of this is free, but since I'm taking the time to help her business, I expect to be treated with respect just like a customer would.\n\nI wait, and I wait. No pictures. I facebook message R twice and ask if she's still going to send them, she basically just says \"yeah, I'm going to get them to you soon\". Never happens. I post on the photographer's facebook page (business page) asking about it, even offering to pay. No response. I felt ignored and disrespected after I took time out of my schedule on short notice to walk around town and take headshots. So I post the following one star review on the photographer's page:\n\n\"(Photographer) took pictures of me and some other girls for a hairstylist. I'm assuming the hairstylist didn't want to buy the pictures (our hair didn't turn out the way she wanted in the pictures because of weather) which is totally within her right. But Ive posted once on the page asking if I could have the pictures (and that I'm willing and ready to pay) and even messaged one of the photographers and instead of even getting a \"no\", I've been ignored. I feel really disrespected. I guess I'm never getting the pictures I was so excited to see, even if I'm more than willing to pay\"\n\nI'm pissed at both R and the photographers after this for wasting my time, and I don't visit R's salon again until today. Nothing is ever said to me about the review, and since I said nothing negative or even identifying about R, I didn't think it was particularly earth shattering.\n\nToday: The only reason I made an appointment for today was because for the first time since she last did my hair, I needed my color updated (I had an ombre which you can go for a while without retouching, in my case, a long long while, since September of 2013). I am picky about who colors my hair, and I thought I'd bite the bullet and just let R do it because by the time I'll need it updated again, I won't be living here (graduating soon). I now realize this was a huge mistake!\n\nI come in at the scheduled time and wait until she's done with the next client. She then greets me with a huge smile on her face. I sit in her chair, and we talk like usual while she is cutting my hair. Then she moves to the coloring part-once she has my hair all wrapped up in tinfoil, this is when her demeanor changes.\n\nShe starts with \"I wish you'd delete that review off of their page.\" Oh god. Now? You could have told me this any time from when I reviewed it to when I walked in the door, and you want to start this now? She knows I'm trapped now because I've got chunks of tinfoil hanging in front of my face. I can barely see.\n\nShe starts off relatively snarky, saying how she thought it was disrespectful because he's got a family to feed and how her daughter models for them (I wouldnt call it modeling if YOU are paying) and how she (R) got chewed out for the review (I'm sorry but I really don't care, if you piss me off, you earned it)\n\nI stand up for myself, I interject my points, but I'm so humiliated because she's doing this in front of her two co workers (who are around my age). \n\nShe also tells me \"You shouldn't have sent that to them because I'm the one who lost the CD!\" Which is something she NEVER told me. I told her she never told me that, then she starts saying \"WELL IT WASN'T EXACTLY AT THE TOP OF MY LIST.\" So, helping the people who help you isn't a priority? Okay!\n\nShe then starts telling her co workers the story WHILE she's leading me to get the chemicals washed out of my hair. After I'm laying down in the chair getting my hair washed (in a VERY vulnerable position, I can see her walking closer towards me with her arms flailing outwards) she starts in on me again, YELLING at me now. I feel so humiliated and cornered that I don't even remember a lot of what she said. I do remember her trying to justify yelling at me like I'm a child because \"she feels like she can do it since she's known me so long, I'm basically family\" &lt;-bullshit. I see her when I get my hair done, and I saw her a few times as a kid. Thats it.\n\nAfter the girl (who I feel so bad for, I know she's got to feel so fucking awkward) washing my hair rinses it, I immediately start ringing it out and trying to put it up. R says, \"I'm just going to brush your hair since I'm sure you want to go\" I said \"I don't even want you to do that.\" Then she tries touching my hair. \"DONT.TOUCH.ME.\"\n\nI pay, she tries saying some more stuff to me. I basically tell her I don't appreciate being yelled at like I'm a child, and she responds with \"Well according to the Bible it's the older women who are responsible for the younger women-\" I cut her off with \"I'M NOT A CHRISTIAN SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE FUCKING PREACHING TO ME. I HOPE YOUR RANT WAS WORTH IT.\" and walk out the door.\n\nI'm still stunned. I can't believe this happened. If she would have said anything about losing the CD, or kept me updated at ALL (goes for the photography page too, just because I'm not paying doesn't mean I'm a worthless peon) then I would have been in the loop and wouldn't have gotten pissed. REGARDLESS, that just isn't how you act in a place of business. Luckily, no other customers were present. Actually, I wish there were so they could have seen how she acted. I felt trapped and embarrassed to the Nth degree. I helped her, she didn't give two shits about helping me, and now we're here.\n\nOh, and I made sure to give her a damn review on every possible webpage listing her business that I know of. We'll see how she likes that.",

She nit picks everything, she's snotty to waiters and waitresses, and she never tips more than 15%, typically much less.\n\nOnce I met her and a friend of hers for lunch at a local diner in my hometown. I was in town visiting family and friends and she mentioned lunch and I thought why not. She brought her friend Jed along. \n\nTo explain about Jed. Jed (not his real name) had a stroke a few years before. He still has trouble identifying certain objects or ordering things for himself. His family and friends try to get him out quite often. He's very nice but definitely have problems functioning on his own. My Mom tries to get him out quite often, and she does a great job at this. He enjoys his time out and it helps him to socialize.\n\nI met them at a diner which I've been going to since I was a really little kid. It's a great place that serves tons of different food plus amazing pie!! Which I always try to indulge in when there.\n\nThe waiter came to see us after we were seated and offered drinks. To make this easy, I'm me, Mom is mom, Jed is J, and Waiter is W.\n\nW \"Hey folks what can I get you guys today?\"\n\nMe \"Water please.\"\n\nMom \"I'd like black coffee.\"\n\nJ \"I'd like.....\" *pauses for a few moments* \"Coffee\"\n\nW \"Would you like cream or sugar with your coffee?\"\n\nJ \".....\"\n\nMom \"Just bring him black coffee\"\n\nThe waiter goes off to get our drinks and brings them back for our order.\n\nMe \"Can I please get a turkey burger and a side salad?\"\n\nMom \"I'd like a club sandwich and please hold the bacon. Also could you please put the mayo on the side?\"\n\nW \"Not a problem what side would you like with that?\" \n\nMom \"Fries\" *she then stops paying attention to the waiter and stares out the window*\n\nJ \"I'd like fries....\" \n\nW \"would you like anything else?\"\n\nJ \"And fries....\"\n\n*Both the waiter and I look at my Mom who's not paying attention*\n\nMe \"That's ok. Right Mom?\"\n\nMom *waves her one hand, still looking out at the window* \"That's fine.\"\n\nSo the food orders go in and we get them pretty quickly. It wasn't busy and diners are typically pretty quick. \n\nW \"Here you go\"\n\nMom \"WAIT A MINUTE, WHERE IS HIS BURGER!?!?\"\n\nW, Me, and J are all kind of stunned from the volume. \n\nMe \"Mom, he just ordered fries, didn't you hear Jed? \"\n\nMom \"NO. He ordered a burger and fries! Where is his burger? We only ever get burgers when we come here.\"\n\nW \"I'm sorry Ma'am, I only heard him order fries\"\n\nMom \"Get him a burger right now!!\"\n\nWaiter scurries away quickly\n\nMe \"Mom, Jed really did just order fries, the waiter and I even asked you about it.\"\n\nMom \"He should've known better, no one just orders fries.\"\n\nShe then proceeds to cut half of her sandwich in half and give him some so Jed has food, because according to her he may starve before the burger comes.....\n\nThe waiter has the kitchen make a burger up and brings it out.\n\nW \"Sorry about that.\"\n\nMom \"You should be. You can do better than that.\"\n\nWaiter turns pretty red and wanders away.\n\n90% of the time I get pie at this diner, because they have uber amazing pie. After the yelling, I was ready to leave.\n\nMom \"do you want dessert?\" \n\nMe \"Naw, I have to get going. Let's just get the check. Here I'll even treat.\"\n\nMom \"No no no, this is my treat. Are you sure you don't want dessert?\"\n\nMe \"I'm good thank you.\"\n\nSo signals the waiter and gets the check. I notice she's using cash but hasn't pulled out enough for a tip. \n\nMe \"Oh are you going to pay at the counter? Can I leave the tip?\"\n\nMom \"No no no, I've got it. You go ahead.\"\n\nJed gets up to stand by the door but I'm waiting. My mom has done this before, something small happens that she doesn't like and she won't leave a tip. So I'm waiting and sipping what's left of my water waiting for her to leave cash for the tip. She comes back to the table and leaves about $2. The bill was inexpensive for three people but $2 isn't a good tip. It's not even really a tip. She grabs her jacket and doesn't see me slip another few dollars on the table for the Waiter. This is not my first rodeo with her in this.\n\nThe waiter told us to have a nice day on our way out. She didn't really say anything, but I did smile back at him. ",

        "text": "This is my first time posting here, I apologize if this is hard to follow.\n\nThe Prelude:\n\nI am not old enough to drive, and am also not allowed to stay home alone due to previous issues that I would rather not talk about. My Dad is also in Scotland at the moment, so me, my sister, and my brother need to go everywhere with her. This time, my brother was going to his Tae Kwon Do (did I spell that right? I don't do those) lessons.\n\nWhen he was finished, we decided on a place to pick up dinner from (my brothers lessons end at about 6:30). This time, one of my favorites! Carls Jr!\n\nSo my mom rolls up to the order-box thingy (to talk to the food cooking people, I don't know this terminology) and orders us our food. First thing I notice is that the guy ringing everything up sounds new. When my mom is done ordering, the order-box thingy didn't show the order, so the guy had to repeat everything.\n\nHe repeated everything fine, and my mom responded (along the lines of) \"You went a bit fast, but it all sounds correct\"\n\nThe Event:\n\nWe get most of our stuff. Then, my mom looks in the bags with our food, as well as our receipt. She sees that her chicken sandwich is missing. She asks about it, and then the guys at the window said they didn't hear her say anything about it.\n\nAnd then the horribleness happens.\n\nShe starts swearing, and throws the bags she has at my feet (we normally put our bags of food at my feet) pretty hard. She is clearly angry, and the employees step away from the window.\n\nI could hear them talking about how they never heard her say anything about a chicken sandwich, and then they return to the window. The window guy is clearly a little scared, and says \"you'll have to wait in the parking lot.\"\n\nMy mom swears some more, calls them incompetent, and drives to a spot in the lot.\n\nShe goes in and talks to them (I have no idea what, I was sitting in the car still with my brother and sister) and comes back. And then waits. It took a while, so she goes in again and demands the credit transaction for the chicken sandwich be canceled and then drives home.\n\nThe Aftermath:\n\nWe get home, and my mom goes back up to her room, on an empty stomach. She is not nice when she is hungry, so I can only imagine how horrible she will be the next day. Anyways, I get the food for my brother, sister, and I and we eat.\n\nI finished, showered, and then wrote this post. I feel really bad for the guys who my mom yelled at.\n\nTL;DR: My mom wont be going to Carls Jr again because of a chicken sandwich.\n\n**Edit**: She's not Satan.\n\n**Edit 2**: She was completely nice and fine the next morning, she must've fed herself while I was asleep :)",

        "text": "Now, I'll be the first to admit I don't know a whole lot about how public transportation works, but I've taken this bus route a few times so I sort of knew what to do.\n\nI had to go to the DMV yesterday morning to get a new ID, as the first two I've ordered never actually showed up in the mail. I don't dirve, so getting there means I go with my brother at 6:30 in the morning and waiting in the cold, unheated plaza for an hour waiting for the DMV to open. In and out of the DMV took about 15 minutes as I was first in line.\n\nI get on the first bus, which goes to a main stop in the city where the DMV is located, where I'm supposed to get on another bus back to my city, but missed that bus by about 30 seconds. It's 15 degrees out and I was pissed that I would have to wait another hour for the next bus home.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later another bus shows up that shows an intersection closer to my apartment than the bus I was originally going to take. Cool! I get on it and hand the woman my transfer and go to my seat. \"Uhh, where are you going?!\" She asks and I look back. \"&lt;My City&gt;\"  I reply, confused why she cares. \"Well, this a regional bus, and you have a local transfer.\" She says back to me in her 'I'm better than thou' sassy tone. I pull out my wallet and say \"I have cash, I don't care, I just need to get ho-\" \"EXCUSE ME?!\" She interrupts. Jesus, woman, I'm fucking paying you, I just want to get home and take a nap. I pull out a five because it's the last bill I have. \"This bus is $2.75!\" \"Look, I really don't care, all I have is a five, I just want to get home.\" \"Harumph.\"\n\nI certainly was not expecting to get yelled at for my lack of understanding how buses work...",

I read a lot of reviews that talked about this being a scam &amp; whatnot, but I fully read the agreement when I gave my credit card information. I knew that a shipment of products was coming.\n\nI got an email because there were new products added to the line &amp; I was intrigued. I also got a 50% off coupon. My products came &amp; unfortunately, there was a leak in one of the bottles &amp; there was goo all over the box. I called customer service, they apologized, sent me a return label &amp; sent out a new box.\n\nA month later, I received an email saying my next box was on its way. I was busy &amp; didn't see the email. Next thing I know, my bank account is hit for $40 &amp; a box shows up on my doorstep. I called customer service &amp; talked to someone. I told her that it was my own stupidity for not being aware, but I wasn't ready for a new box of supplies. She said \"not a problem at all\" and issued a return label. She said that as soon as the box is received, she will credit my account. She asked if there was anything else she could do for me &amp; I said no, but apologized to her for all the negative reviews they've received. She said she appreciated my candor, but they're used to it.\n\nYesterday, I received a post card from the customer service rep thanking me for my upbeat disposition &amp; my membership in their company. :)  Yes, some times things go so very right!",

It took Failnet 2 months to upgrade the line, provide the correct router (the first one didn't support VoIP), make my landline work again and make the internet work at least intermittently. Afterwards, it took 4 months to handle the intermittent internet dropouts, which apparently crashed the router as I had to reboot that piece of... manure every fricking time the connection dropped and it took 3 minutes minimum to boot up. But yeah, still better than no internet.\n\nE-freaking-ventually, they do upgrade their infrastructure and the connection becomes usable again. Sure, the bandwidth changes between 5 and 90 Mbps depending on the time of day and the alignment of the stars, but it did not drop out every 15 minutes anymore. Or so I thought...\n\nThen, this Sunday, the issue happened again. [EXPLETIVE DELETED, SERIOUSLY, IF THE FOUNDING FATHERS HEARD THAT, THEY WOULD RECONSIDER FREEDOM OF SPEECH]! Of course the Failnet support line was already closed when the issue happened. It always is... So I called Failnet first thing this morning. I provided my name and account number to the CSR and he immediately (with no time to look over my notes) said: \"Weren't you that person who called for 6 months about internet problems?!\"\n\nYes, I was... and it looks as if this odysee will last even longer as this person immediately found quite a few things wrong with my line... yay!\n\ntl;dr: they're flouncy, bouncy, pouncy, trouncy, / fun, fun. fun, fun, fun, / but the best thing there is about telcos / Is Failnet's the only one.\n",

She chooses to pick fights with dining staff instead of just going to the dining halls that have vegan food pre made and ready to go.\n\nMy college campus has a dunkin' donuts knock off coffee shop that's pretty popular. This story took place at that special time of day where everyone was either on their way to class, or just got out, so the line stretched into forever land. \n\nI had just placed my order, and was waiting for my drink, when this entitled jerk behind me made her order. I was \"lucky\" enough to overhear the encounter (EJ= Entitled Jerk; C= Cashier)\n\n&gt;EJ: Okay, so, I'd like a [Insert Drink Here]. But I'm Vegan, so everyone behind the counter needs to wash their hands, put on new gloves, and clean all the nozzles before making it.\n\n&gt;C:...But, miss, your drink requires the use of 3 or our machines, it would be 20 minutes to clean everything before we can even start on your order!\n\n&gt;EJ: That's fine, I'll wait! :3 \n\n&gt;C: Let me talk to my manager, because there is a significant line behind you and I don't think it'd be fair to everyone else to have them wait that long.\n\n&gt;EJ: But that's discriminatory to vegans! Why can't I have the same curtesy of going to a coffee shop and ordering my drink just like everyone else!?\n\n&gt;C: I would gladly make your drink to your specifications if you were the only person here, but the line-\n\n&gt;EJ: *Do I need to file yet another report?* \n\nEveryone in line within a close proximity complained and yelled about how it was unfair and all that jazz. Luckily I had ordered before her, and got my drink before the extensive wait.\n\nYeah, they shouldn't have made her drink, BUT this girl had currently been making a ruckus at all dining halls as well about there being no vegan options (**DISCLAIMER** Two dining halls on campus are half vegan here, she's just an entitled jerk and goes around saying \"But **ME!** But what *I* want!!!\" regardless of the VAST majority of the school having non-vegan diets). Because of this, and because of strict non-discriminatory policies, they had to make her drink, and lost the entire line of business behind her.\n\nShe posted [THIS](http://imgur.com/YOJiW4U) on her Facebook (She sued the dean/college because they wouldn't make a special meal plan for her; which required chefs to drop what they were doing whenever she came in to scrub the grills and make any dish she requested. Regardless of the fact that there were vegan options prepared and ready to serve at the dining hall just across the street.... and she fucking won.)\n\n**Screams into the sunset**\n\nEdit: TL;DR added, grammar",

        "text": "My husband and I decided to wait until the day after VDay to go out to eat to celebrate. This was Sunday night of what I know was an insanely busy weekend for restaurants everywhere. We went to one of our favorite Byobs that specializes in fabulous Italian food from scratch. This restaurant is amazing and goes out of its way to make their meals perfect for every customer.\n\nAn example would be we went there with friends for dinner once. Even though it wasn't on the menu, the owner/cook made homemade Carbonara after one if our friends asked if they would ever feature it as a special. The reason the owner was so nice about making it was he had all of the correct ingredients already and wanted to go out of his way to do something special. \n\nHowever there are some customers that will abuse this kind feature pretty regularly.\n\nDuring our VDay dinner, my husband and I really enjoyed ourselves. Our waitress was very nice and brought everything promptly, checking on us, refilling drinks, bringing extra bread. We had finally gotten our entrees and the hostess seats a table of four beside us.\nBecause the food was amazing, and we're both kind of quiet while eating, we heard everything from the table beside us.\n\nTo make this easy, Waitress is W, there were two couples, one of the women didn't speak. So I'll refer to the customers as Man1, Man2, and Woman.\n\nW \"Good evening, how are you doing tonight\"\n\nWoman \"We called yesterday to request a special cut of steak. The owner said she would check to see if it was available.\"\n\nW *looking a bit confused* \"Oh ok, she has the day off today but I'll go check in the back and call her if I can't find the information. Can I get anything else to drink for anyone or open your wine for you?\"\n\nWoman \"We'd prefer for you to go check now, it's ridiculous to make us wait any further.\"\n\nW was still smiling and excused herself for a few minutes to the back of the restaurant.\n\nW \"I'm sorry, I was able to get ahold of her and she apologizes but she was unable to find that cut of steak on such short notice this weekend. She said it was featured a few weeks ago as a special but it is not part of our regular menu. May I tell you about our other specials for this evening.\"\n\nWoman \"Well that is just ridiculous, a day is more than enough time for them to go out and get this for us.\"\n\nW \"I'm very sorry, we have a few other steak options tonight as part of the specials for Valentine's Day Weekend, may I tell you about them?\"\n\nThe woman sighs elaborately but waves her hand to indicate that the waitress should tell them the specials.  W does so.\n\nWoman \"Ok, I'll take your swordfish special. Now I don't want any SAUCE or SPICES on it, I want it to be plain and NOT over cooked. Got it? And instead of pasta or salad, I want a plain steamed vegetable. Something like broccoli or asparagus. GOT IT?\"\n\nMan2 *Who sounds like he's trying not to laugh* \"So you want swordfish?\"\n\nWoman shoots him a dirty look and waits for the Waitress to repeat everything back to her, word by word.\n\nW smiles and writes everything down and then repeats it back to the Woman super politely. She then turns to Man1 on the other side. Man1 speaks for both himself and his wife.\n\nMan1 \"Now we'd like to split your Caesar salad to start with, BUT we don't want croutons or Parmesan cheese and the salad dressing to be put on the side.\" (Aka he wanted two small plates of plain lettuce)\n\nWaitress \"Absolutely sir, and for your entree?\"\n\nMan1 \"I want your Veal chop special, but I don't want it breaded or seasoned. I also want it cooked well done. Instead of the pasta that comes with it, I just want plain mashed potatoes.\" \n\nMan1's wife then leans over and whispers to him.\n\nMan1 \"My wife would like plain steamed vegetables on top of plain pasta. No garlic or seasoning on it.\"\n\nMan2 *who seems to be trying not to snicker too hard* \"I'll take your vegetable lasagna please.\"\n\nW \"Absolutely. Let me get you refills on your water and some fresh bread.\"\n\nWe didn't stay for very long after this, but made sure to give the Waitress a hell of a good tip for our great service and what we were sure would be horrible time serving the table beside us.\n",

She jokingly mentioned that she is gluten free and wouldn't say no to a piece of pie, and the conversation went on until I paid and left.\n\n\nWhen I was walking back to my car, I realized that the pie I was taking home probably wouldn't get eaten anyway, so a few minutes later I walked back into the shop with the box and gave her the whole pie. Her face lit up and she told me I made her day! I was really glad to hear that, but honestly I was glad to give it to someone who would enjoy it and she was very nice and helpful; she deserved it.",
