I have been considering comparing and analysing screenshots from the series looking at the discourse that could arise from this. However I am concerned that this is not a tried and tested approach within discourse analysis. \n\nI have considered a content analysis however I feel I am more suited and prefer a more qualitative approach. \n\nI have 6 weeks to complete this research proposal so I'm just brainstorming here. \n\nThanks for anyone who takes the time to read this and have a good weekend!\n\nZulem",

What are they? What about the conditions it was used in made it so it didn't change?\n\nEdit: Just in case it's not clear, I mean any language in history during its use. Like let's say a language that was wiped out when invaders decided to switch its speakers to their language, but before that it barely ever changed. Or a language that was stable for a long time before becoming more fluid later. Both of those would be viable.",

As usual, the emailed response from the school was \"there are people of all ages!\" But I don't trust that and want to invest in lodging and plane tickets based on that. I haven't had fun when I've been the only person in my age group, ever.\n\nPlease advise! Thanks!",

        "text": "So something that I've noticed is that the pronunciation of the vowel sound /æ/ is different in most dialects of American English than in Received Pronunciation and some other dialects of English.\n\nIn the word *cat*, for instance, the /æ/ sound in the middle is identical in both AE and RP. But in the word *can*, it is not the same at all. In AE, the /æ/ sound seems to change whenever it's placed before an nasal, such as /n/, /m/, or /ŋ/.\n\nI have been trying like hell to find any kind of literature or explanation on this phenomenon, to no avail. I can't even find a way to write it in IPA. Can anyone help me out with this?",

A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).\n\n**Commenting rules**\n\nThe rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics. You don’t have to be a flaired user to answer questions, but we expect answers to reflect an expert level of knowledge. Please familiarize yourself with [**our commenting policy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1u9xsr/reminder_of_the_rlinguistics_commenting_policy/) and [**our subreddit rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/rules).\n\n**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**\n\nYour question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it. This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

I am really curious if this is just a temporary thing and after, for example, 20 years I will be more hesitant toward certain topics the same way as I am in my native language right now.",
