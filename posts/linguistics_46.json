Examples like foughten or jotten (down a note).\n\nFurthermore, I find that seeing it written down and reading it makes many of these feel ungrammatical to me, but when actually casually speaking it without thinking, it doesn't sound odd.\n\nIs this uncommon? Are there area or age trends that show signs of this usage?",

        "text": "Hello everyone. This is my first post here on /r/linguistics. I am not a linguist, but rather an humble geek who often bores coworkers and family members with rants like the following one. So please forgive any noobiness in what follows.\n\nLet me define 'passive sentence' a sentence in which the direct object of the action determined by the verb is elevated to the rank of subject (let me also assume we are considering a nominative-accusative language). This should, more or less, correspond to the traditional definition of what passive is (correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nMy question is: what happens to what used to be the subject? In English, one can most often use the preposition 'by' and be happy with it: \"i was kissed by the girl\".\nThis is essentially the same thing that happens in my native language (Italian) and every other language I know/checked: one can use prepositions 'da' in Italian, 'par' in French, and 'ni' in Japanese (which lumidaub kindly pointed out being a postposition).\n\nThe interesting thing is that these adpositions are used, in the respective languages, also for marking non-alignment cases in generic phrases.\n\nThis leads to my question(s):\n\n1 - Are there languages in which the \"demoted subject\" is marked, in the passive voice, with a specific morphological construction not seen elsewhere?\n\n2 - Is there a language which marks the \"demoted subject\" with the case normally reserved for the direct object?\n\n3 - What other curious construction can happen?\n\n...thank you in advance &amp; Cheers!",

Meanwhile, most other Romance languages that have kept a similar form instead have vós, vous, voi, etc. That's all fine, until you realize that a lot of these languages also have a form similar to the Spanish one: Portuguese has/had vos\\-outros, many French dialects still have vous\\-autres, and some Italian dialects have forms like voialtri \\(probably through contact with regional languages in this case\\).\n\nSo, my question is, what's the origin of this \"you\\-others\"? Where did this change first occur, and from where did it begin spreading?\n\nI also notice a similar trend with the first\\-person plural: nosotros in Spanish, nos\\-outros/nusotrus in regional/archaic Portuguese, nous\\-autres in some French dialects, and noialtri in some Italian dialects.

There are exceptions to these three rules, and sometimes this system can get messy when it comes to direct borrowings from other languages, but they are enough to be able to discern the gender of the vast, vast majority of words.\n\nOn the other hand, the German grammatical gender system is much less consistent. Even though it has rules, they are generally much more complicated and riddled with exceptions. The most consistent rule is about the always feminine endings that create abstract concepts like -keit and -schaft, but that is just a remnant of how the feminine gender came to be in Proto-Indo-European in the first place.\n\nThe grammatical gender systems of IE languages vary like this. Some are based on endings much more consistently than others. What caused this? Is this something that doesn't really have an explanation and is just a pecularity of language evolution?",

        "text": "The articles were by [Jonathan Meades in the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5756245/Queens-English-tool-social-mobility.html) and [Laura Barton in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/may/22/received-pronunciation-may-be-dying-out-but-its-passing-is-long-overdue).  \n\nAre such ideas reduced to impressions like these, or are quantitative studies of this accent sometimes done? How are they carried out? (I would assume they would use samples wider than broadcast media; I remember in the 1990s seeing maps of the spread of 'Estuary English' - which must have been carried out among members of the public.) Studying RP among the general population would have the extra hurdle of its not being entirely region-specific.   \n\nI would also be interested in links to post-2000 studies about RP. \n\nAnd also on a different one, studies on youth accents in London and environs. (The character of Eggsy in *Kingsman* is a great example of the Afro-Caribbean influenced youth accent that seems to have progressively replaced Cockney for at least some working class kids at some time over the 21st century, and which is different again from Estuary English which was itself regarded as novel in the last decades of the 20th.)   \n\nETA: RP seems somewhat slippery. Further to the example of the *Kingsman* films, Colin Firth is a good example of contemporary basically-RP with slight regional inflections (which I think is read as RP by most of the general public; the way he says 'a good man' about 30 seconds in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDJEyqNw-9k) is the sort of non-RP bit I mean). But he is still somewhat different from a traditional but recent Radio 4 presenter such as [Charlotte Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9wtJGpoO7A), whose accent is different again from, say, [Kenneth Clark in *Civilisation*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHa4vEusEB4), who's quite close to the voice on [a 1930s newsreel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieF3d_YBUh4). Is RP merely evolving rather than dying?",

What happens in Romanian is that some words switch from a masculine singular to a feminine plural. How is this considered to be neutral? It's totally unlike a language like Greek, which has 3 clearly defined genders.\n\nFrench does the same thing as Romanian in some cases, but isn't considered to have a third gender. Here is an excerpt from wikipedia for French which : [\"Some (very rare) nouns change gender according to the way they are used: the words amour 'love' and délice 'pleasure' are masculine in singular and feminine in plural\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_grammar).\n\nSo can a linguist explain shed some light on why is Romanian considered to have a third gender?",

The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

        "text": "Hi y’all,\n\nI’m a native speaker of English and Hebrew, born and raised in Israel. I got my English thanks to my mother who went to high school in Chicago (or was it Skokie?...), and also a lot of media exposure.\n\nI recently started tutoring a kid in the fourth grade who’s starting to learn to read and write in English. This meant going online (especially Wikipedia) and reading about all sorts of rules for spelling that I was mostly instinctively aware of, but not entirely, and also reading up on certain sound mergers in different dialects.\n\nI found out quite a few interesting things, like the fact that the ‘marry’–‘merry’–‘Mary’ merger was far more widespread than I’d thought (I don’t have it at all), and that apparently I don’t have the ‘horse’–‘hoarse’ merger. (Also, I could’ve sworn the word ‘pour’ is pronounced with a long [u] vowel, like ‘poor’... Blew my damn mind.) Also, going by the Wikipedia article on /æ/-tensing, apparently I have a _very_ conservative NY accent—hell, I even pronounce ‘do’ and ‘dew’ differently, and I’m 26. (I do like the idea of making fewer mergers: this means both less ambiguity and a more 1:1 ratio between spelling and my pronunciation that a student can rely on.) Although, oddly enough, I used to pronounce ‘orange’ and its ilk with an [o] vowel but ‘forest’ specifically with a low back unrounded vowel. (I suspect it’s because I clung to how it’s pronounced in the introductory song in Disney’s _Robin Hood_: ‘Robin Hood and Li’l John walking through the fahrest...’)\n\nHowever, the most surprising thing to come across was what it mentioned about the ‘cot’–‘caught’ merger and the ‘lot’–‘cloth’ split. From what I noticed in my own speech, I don’t have the merger in careful speech, but I tend to merge more in rapid speech. However, the split seems to work according to slightly different rules for me, somehow, depending partially not just on the syllable coda, but also how many of them there are in a word, and what the onset it (e.g. a labial/ized consonant makes it more likely for the vowel to be rounded and raised, e.g. in ‘Bob’ or ‘rot’, or maybe it just sounds like that to me). I was talking to my cousin in New York last night and I tried to glean any sort of generalization from his speech, but I didn’t get a lot of concrete conclusions, although I noticed he made many judgements that were very similar to my own.\n\nDoes anyone have any more reliable info on this? I’d really like to be able to pinpoint my accent more accurately, and also make sure I don’t sound outright foreign when speaking English.\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: I can differentiate the low back vowels as well as ‘cot’ and ‘caught’ consistently when affecting an RP accent. So it’s not completely an UR issue. Also, in my mother’s dialect, she consistently pronounces ‘not’ as ‘[nät]’, and the vowel in ‘caught’ would be raised to New Yorker levels.",

        "text": "Hi! I figured I would ask some language experts about this, to have a more nuanced view, with much less “emotiveness”. I have read some sociolinguistic books about the issue and learned a bit about Language planning, so I know that diglossia is in some ways in check thanks to the *Charter of the French language*… But living the linguistic duality in Montréal, I cannot help but feel that French is losing ground as a common communication language in favour of English. Speaking French has become a way to accommodate the French majority… Young immigrant children speak mostly English to each other, that’s the natural language. They feel no attachment towards French. Even young Québécois are favouring English more and more, and cannot express themselves without the use of English in their sentences. I even know some Francophone-born who speak English to each other… All-the-time. They are all about American culture and they don’t know about modern Québécois artists. I cannot understand this; why you could toss aside your own culture and language that way, seeing just how much our situation is precarious in North America. Only older people seem to care about this now, so we’re screwed when they die out.\n\nI am a Québécois myself, and I’ve started to be worried, obsessed, disheartened by the survival of French in my province and in Canada at large. I always find myself arguing with English Canadians on the Internet about this, as they simply don’t realize just how central a language can be to one’s culture. They simply see this as a “tool of communication” … It isn’t. Without French, we’re becoming just like the millions of assimilated French Canadians outside Québec who have become nothing English Canadians with French surnames, just like the millions from the Québécois diaspora in the States who have left nothing behind but cities with French names, like the Cajun who now see the French language as something quaint and are not really concerned about their Acadian brothers’ struggles up north.\n\nI fear that when we’ll become too small a minority, the language laws will go (either provincially or federally). English Canadians don’t care about the French language, and only see this as an expenditure or something that hinders their access to some positions at the federal level. They don’t see us as the founding people of Canada, just a pesky minority who always want more.\n\nPlease don’t tell me that “language disappear all the time and it’s a normal thing of life”. It’s not normal, it’s a sad day when a language die out. It means a way to envision, to see, to name the world has disappeared, and we lost a huge part of the world cultural diversity. That’s goddamn tragedy. All the more when you see this happening to your own language.\n\nI guess my question is, do you see Québec French at risk of disappearing? What factors or change in society would make it at risk of disappearing?\n\nEdit: can someone tell me what I did wrong to receive these downvotes? Is my post too long?\n\nEdit 2: Sorry if I am being dismissive towards English Canadians... I will try to be less antagonistic from this point on.\n",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nESL teacher here. I have a student who is struggling with acquiring BICS at a young age (he’s 9 right now), and I would love some insight on whether his trajectory is within the norm or not in SLA for a child his age.\n\nThis child came from a Spanish-speaking country to the United States 2 years ago, in the summer before second grade. He is now about to finish third grade. Despite having been immersed in English for these 2 years, he doesn’t seem to have picked up much BICS at all. He can’t consistently answer the question “How are you?” (he sometimes answers appropriately with “good” or “tired” or “hungry,” but he just as often answers with his name). He has also needed to be explicitly taught basic sentence starters such as “I like...” and still has trouble distinguishing it from “I have...” I have never heard him naturally produce an \"I am...\" sentence (he often says \"I have boy\" instead of \"I am [a] boy.\"). He actually has no peers who speak his L1, so the poor little guy has been pretty isolated despite his sunny demeanor and desire to make friends. This makes his case all the more odd for me as I'm pretty positive it has nothing to do with motivation or with lack of exposure.\n\nI’ve only been working with him for this past year as he was in another state before this year, so I can't speak to his prior ESL education aside from the fact that he was in an ESL inclusion class. He is enrolled in a gen ed class now and works with me 5 periods a week for intensive pull-out instruction (3 periods of 1-on-1 instruction and 2 periods of small-group instruction). Most of these periods were spent on targeted CALP instruction until I realized that this student was not making progress in BICS on his own. I then started incorporating explicit instruction in BICS in our 1-on-1 periods and in warm-up activities in our small-group classes. He’s benefitted a lot from this explicit instruction, but like I mentioned, he is still inconsistent in his use and understanding of even the most basic/common BICS language after 6+ months of this type of instruction. When compared to his peers in the small-group class, his lack of BICS acquisition is especially alarming. \n\nHis teacher and I have noticed other non-linguistic signs that suggest cognitive processing issues, and he’s in line for a psych eval that we’re pretty sure will lead to an IEP - which I believe will greatly benefit him. Even so, I'm not confident that I know how to formally address his lack of progress BICS. Are there any resources for explicit instruction of BICS for young children who are immersed in the target language, or does the literature mostly assume that BICS is picked up naturally at this age and that it's CALP which needs to be explicitly taught?\n\n(FYI, his Spanish is pretty basic but he can definitely communicate in it. He is also literate at a first-grade-ish level in Spanish, which makes sense considering he left his home country after the first grade. His father is fluently bilingual and tries to speak English with him while Mom speaks mostly Spanish.)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
