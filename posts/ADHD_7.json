I can now officially say I have ADHD. \n\nI’m still wrapping my head around what this means and the context that it is giving to my life. \n\nWill gladly take any off the cuff advice. I believe I have a pretty standard experience with the feelings of inferiority (stemming from feeling stupid constantly), difficulty listening and retaining spoken/written information etc. \n\nWhat was it like for you when you first found out you had ADHD?",

I’ve already tried the typical tips like getting enough sleep, exercise, and eating a healthy diet, but they don’t seem to be enough.\n\nI’m looking for some lesser known tactics that will help me stay in task. I’m mostly interested in any psychological tricks that have worked for others with ADHD.\n\nHave any of you found any creative ways to increase your productivity? Maybe some tactics that focus on motivation, concentration, or organization?\n\nI would really appreciate any advice or tips that you can offer. Thank you!",

We stayed up all night talking about it and making sure all our bases were covered and it’s what we both wanted. Everything was good and I caught her cheating on me Christmas Day of 2021. \n\nHere’s why ADHD played a role into it. I was very inconsistent with how I loved and showed affection. I wasn’t purposely being toxic, but sometimes I would just shut down the world and hyperfixate on something and for hours, the only thing that mattered was the one thing I was doing whether it was video games, working on my project car, or cleaning the house. I wasn’t giving her the attention she really wanted and she also never communicated that. I learned that about myself and with my new girlfriend now, I told her “if you want attention, please just tap me on the shoulder and remind me that I’m fixating again and you want me” just be supportive. The thing is, I just don’t realize it. It’s not that I don’t care, I really do, it’s just that I go “emotionless” for a small period of time and I can’t control it. \n\nI also come to learn after my divorce, a healthy relationship shouldn’t rely on how much money you spend on someone, it relies on how much of your attention you give them.",

This led me to being fired from a previous job, something I don't want to repeat.\n\n-I had been unmedicated since the beginning, therefore once the interest waned, so did my motivation to perform.\n\n-Psychiatrist currently has me on a very low dose and is not responding to my requests to have our next appointment early in order to adjust dosage.\n\n-Work performance has improved considerably on Medikinet (Ritalin generic). Problem is I'm running out of meds.\n\nSo as a result, this quarter's deliverables were late. Like, very late. They were done well, but meeting deadlines in the financial world is our bread and butter. \n\nConsequently, I now have three people calling me twice a day to ask me what I have been doing all day, and they're playing around with an Excel spreadsheet separating my 8 hours into blocks.\n\nThey aren't budging with my requests to allow me to work late (my sleep cycle is wacked), nor about allowing me to choose the type of work my brain finds interesting (for example, I can spend hours playing around Excel and doing mathy mathematics, or setting up complicated systems, but instead they want me to sit in front of 50 page financial statements and tax returns that feel like torture).\n\nI have made it abundantly clear I cannot work like this, and it's starting to really increase my anxiety and stress levels to the point that I'm starting to feel unwell.\n\nI also have a tingling feeling that they don't really believe my struggles are real. I believe they think I'm just finding \"excuses to justify my laziness.\"\n\nMetaphorically speaking, I have always felt like a very jumpy dog that has been allowed to roam free.

For me to accept something and move forward with it, in literally every aspect of my life, i feel i need to have a lot of info on it and be able to contextualize it. My clinician told me yep i think you have ADHD, meds will help, would you like them? I said yes but i want to know more. I want to know what type i have, how it specifically affects me, what the physical differences my brain has to a 'normal' one, specifically how the medication works blah blah blah. I feel i cant move on with my life until i fully understand this part of myself. My therapist doesn't know anything about ADHD, and while she offered that we learn about it together, i just want to see someone who really understands it. Someone who can help me figure out the things, thoughts and systems i use/do that are linked to my ADHD, and how i can help myself with them and create better habits.  I have left her to try find someone educated on ADHD that will also be able to help with my other struggles i have (self-confidence, anxiety, low energy etc..) as I feel they are all related. Its been a bit of a struggle to find this human fountain of ADHD knowledge. The best i have found is someone who have delt with multiple ADHD clients, but has 'limited knowledge' and is no expert in the field. I have a session booked with her this week but I'm not sure about it. Maybe i don't need an expert on ADHD to help me but I'm not sure. \n\nIn regards to medication, i tried 30,50, and 70mg elvanse in a month and felt no different, and i didn't notice myself being any more efficient. I have not moved onto concertaXL. Currently on the 3rd day of 27mg and feeling the same way again. No change. I'm finding it difficult because i don't really know what I'm meant to be experiencing taking these, but a lot of people here post how great it is. I know the pills aren't magic, and it makes complete sense that you need to put the effort in. The way i thought about it was, if this pill reduces my current ADHD symptoms, that's brill lets go be productive, but all my ways of living have been developed with an ADHD brain. I need to know what systems/habits i do that i don't need to anymore, and be educated on some new healthier ones. I just feel like meds and therapy are both crucial, so while I'm not receiving any therapy/education, it is a surprise my meds are not doing anything? Im not sure. \n\nIm not really sure what I'm asking here, just really want to get some advice and hear from some other about their experiences and opinions. Have a bless day everyone",

That day was like an doomsday and for the rest of the few school weeks we had my motivation was sinking like crazy. İ am more depressed then ever and i feel it in the way i act, i am lonlier then ever and ever since that \"doomsday\" i haven't studied a full hour without constantly crying or dozing off. İ do thing i have a trauma regarding school and all but it feels like my meds are not working at all. İ had to switch my psychiatrist due us moving and the new one told me that it might be the depression and she gave me a higher Dosis (from 18 to 25) . After a whole month, i spoke to her again to check up and she asked how i am doing. Truth is , i don't know if i am able to be as motivated as i was when i thought all my problems were gonna be solved when i pass that exam, it felt like a punch in the face, it set something off i think or meds are off, which is hard to believe. İ told her that i don't want a higher Dosis but i yet feel no different or secure , she now prescribed me Escitalopram 10 mg.( Anti- depressants), i will pick them up tomorrow. İ am currently in therapy, but since i started in January i still feel no different. \nİ feel so hopeless, everyone in my old class in going to graduate this spring and here i stand without having touched one single pen. \n\nAny advice on  how depression affects stattera use ? Since I'm currently 18, my doc wouldn't give me a higher Dosis then 25 mg stattera btw. \nAll answera are greatly appreciated 👍❤️",

The thing I didn't know about ADHD is that it can cause depressive like symptoms if not treated properly. I was placed on Vyvanse, Wellbutrin (and she is keeping me on my lexapro - we don't wanna take me off anything that is making me feel better in conjunction with my V/W). I am finally busy during the day, going to workout classes, engaging in conversations with people and feeling a mutual interest in the conversation. I used to stay in bed all day, skip class, had no motivation to live... this medication has CHANGED my life. I am a human and this is what life really feels like. It makes me really emotional to speak on this because I am 26 and I had lived my life undiagnosed until now. Vyvanse is expensive but my psychiatrist states that I wont build a tolerance to it as fast as it doesn't just metabolize in the liver but also in my red blood cells.. Hoping for a generic ASAP!",

Historically, I would read it with no comprehension. But say I read it. Or I just wouldn’t read it. Now, I’m trying to be better and actually do my job well. I looked up how to have better reading comprehension, but nothing seems helpful. It’s all about asking questions and getting the answers.

And I’m realizing the instant I don’t understand something, I completely tune out. Which makes learning new things I don’t understand immediately pretty darn difficult.\n\nHow do you start?

How do you recognize what is actually important in what you’re reading (and not highlight every damn word)?",

        "text": "Hi!\n\nSo, this is a post in which I would love to get input. I haven't done anything yet, and I don't plan to just yet, but I was wondering if coming clean with the student would be the way to go, against his mother's wishes.\n\nI (F early 20s) am a language teacher in an academy. One of my students (12M) was diagnosed with ADHD about 3 years ago. Since then, his parents have been in denial. They refuse any treatment whatsoever, no therapy, no meds, nothing. They have not told the child he has ADHD. I complied with it at the beginning because I was told they were looking for a second opinion.\n\nSo far, he has been diagnosed by several professionals, public and private doctors, therapists, we have filled in at least 4 forms that have been used for evaluation... He has ADHD. He just does. He was not very aware of his own struggles a couple years ago, but he has become more and more aware as he grows up.\n\nThe parents started to give him \"natural, alternative medicine drops\" in the morning. I'm unsure of the effect of that but it's sure as H that it wears off before my classes. He has gotten worse, can't stay still, won't focus, will distract everyone around him, and, what is worse: he is very sad. He doesn't know why he can't concentrate, but he can't; he doesn't know why he tries to study and can't memorize; he doesn't know why he is regressing and forgetting knowledge he already knew... He is really frustrated and has several times asked me what is wrong with him and why he is dumb. I reassured him he is not dumb every time and try to adapt his exams a little to help out (underline things, shorten the questions). I can't adapt it too much, though, because then the others will realise and he won't know how to react. I also try to pay more attention to him and explain things further to him so that he doesn't loose track of the class.\n\nI think that it is time to tell the child that he has ADHD and that the reason why he learns in different ways is because of that. That he is not dumb at all and that he just needs some help and some adapting on his exams and ways of learning. I also think it's time to explain what ADHD is and to tell him that it isn't a disease or anything, I just think it's time to explain and talk to him about it. Mom refuses. Her child does NOT have ADHD.\n\nI don't know what to do. My boss supports me if I wanna tell him, because he is my student, but I don't know if I should or not. What is more important? That the child stops feeling useless and frustrated or sparing the mom's feelings and thoughts about the matter? I really don't know. It breaks my heart to see him so clueless and frustrated with himself. His self-esteem is also going down the drain. School has chosen to do what mom wants, but I answer to noone but my boss in the end...\n\nBIG EDIT: I would be legally in the clear to disclose this info to the child once he turns 13 really soon. When he turns 13, he will be able to go to the doctor and override his parent's wishes. He could get a report. He could get the accomodations he needs with it, all without parent's permissions. But he can't do that if he doesn't know and doesn't go to the doctor.\n\nEdit2: I have seen the doctors reports, there are many. The mom shows them to us but doesn't send them to us, so that she can keep the child from being treated different (being given accomodations).\n\nHelp?",

Got married right after I came back from that trip and then life and honeymoon and I moved and they still charged me $90 every single month.   \nI don't even know where the rented clothes are (I remember I put them all in the bag to return with the correct postage and everything but my mind is blank after that).   \nSo now here I am, emailing the help desk to see if that the $990 I paid in membership fees for a service I did not utilize can cover the cost of the missing clothes. I am hoping they will tell me that they will void the $570 it costs to purchase the clothes and cancel the membership as I have paid over that amount in fees. I doubt it but fingers crossed....if they say no I will probably have to just charge all of that onto a card...I have done so well this past year in getting my spending and savings right. I paid off my cards, I put money away every paycheck, I have cut back my spending and become so much more fiscally responsible over the past year and this just feels like a punch to the chest. \n\nI literally hate myself and how stupid I am for repeatedly forgetting to address this. It was one of those issues that I just decided to ignore until I just sat down and did the math. I hate subscription services. I hate how they're set up to profit off of people's unsubscribing. I will never sign up for a clothing subscription service again. It did not and will never make sense for me. Here is me mourning my hard earned money as that would have been living expenses for an entire month.",

        "author": "russdr",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11rx0hg/advice_on_strange_interaction_with_provider/",
        "text": "I had an interaction with a provider yesterday that I'd like to get some opinions on.  I want to see how far to take it.  At minimum, I'll not be returning.\n\nFor context, I'm currently trying to find a provider in my area and this was my initial meeting.  Right off the bat, the \"interview\" was very cold and they essentially read a list of questions and wrote down my answers in a very scripted and, to me, an emotionally disconnected manner interrupting me often and repeating questions multiple times.  That's not the concerning part as everyone is different and maybe they needed to concentrate while they wrote.\n\nThe concerning part was at the end in regards to my prescription.  They said that they normally don't prescribe stimulants to new patients and starts with non-stimulant meds, but since I had already started treatment via stimulants elsewhere, they'd continue me on the same meds, just at a lower dose.  I didn't argue with that but the provider went on to say that they don't understand the craze about stimulants.  1st major red flag.\n\nThey went on to say that my prescription history was \"spotty\" because I hadn't gotten refills in the last (2) months of 2022.  I stated that it was because of the shortage.  I told them I called multiple local pharmacies to no avail.  It wasn't until the 1st week of January that I found them.  They interrupted saying that the shortage didn't start until February of 2022.  I rebutted that I have multiple emails with my previous provider asking for advice on what to do regarding the shortage around that time.  I even went as far as saying I'll pull up my phone history to the various pharmacies on a weekly basis.  They shrugged it off.  On top of that, they stated that if I've been without meds for that long, I didn't really need it.  I replied that I had to ration and it was an absolute struggle.  Second major red flag.\n\nThe last major red flag was that they circled back to using non-stimulant type of medication as an initial treatment to which I replied that when I started my treatment with my previous provider, I asked them to start me with the lowest dosage of the prescription as possible.  I wanted to start low and work up to what I felt was the best dosage.  After hearing that, the provider started looking at my prescription history and said that they didn't see the lower doses, just higher doses.\n\nAt that point, I asked them to please tell me where they are reading that information because it is incorrect.  I told them I don't feel comfortable knowing my history was incorrect as it makes me look like I'm lying and worse off, it makes me look like I'm lying about my history with a controlled substance.\n\nThey said it was a directory from the state but started to change the subject and dismiss the importance of what was happening.  I said I have emails that show my low dosage and that I wasn't lying.  At that point, they were completely dismissive as if it wasn't important and started to talk about the next item.\n\nI've since asked my previous provider for my medical history and I'll be asking for it from my primary at my next appointment as well.  I don't know if the new provider was lying or not yet but I feel as though if my medical history does in fact reflect the proper dosing, that I need to make some sort of complaint somewhere.\n\nI can somewhat understand their aversion to stimulants but it felt more like they were trying to find any way to not treat me and make me look like an addict than discussing how my current treatment had altered my life vastly for the better.  All this, to me, is grounds for never returning.  Where I feel the line is drawn is lying to me about my medical history as a means to disallow or deter me from proceeding with the same treatment.\n\nShould I escalate?  Is there something I can or should do?  I think it's rather dangerous that someone like this is out there claiming to be a medical professional using tactics like this.\n\ntldr:\nProspective provider had multiple red flags but one was that they may have lied to me about my medical history (but I need to confirm).  Can I escalate?  Should I escalate?",

It's less exhausting that way. If the conversation does ever get 'deep' people tend to steer it back to shallow waters because, I don't know, maybe it's too redolent of n alcoholics anonymous meeting or something. Doesn't help that group conversations usually take place in bars and venues where the music is deafening so you need to shout to be heard... auditory processing issues aren't too fond of this dynamic.  \n\nAnyone got any advice for how to manage group conversations and be more engaging?",

My husband is a go-getter and has extremely developed executive function. He just, does stuff. Right away. He doesn’t think about it, it just happens. \n\nThis *paralyzes* me. I feel a lot of guilt and shame when he swoops in and does something that is my responsibility. I wallow in shame, further paralysis, I do less, he swoops in, the cycle continues. \n\nWhen I am alone, no one is depending on me so I can do things at the speed that works for me. So I don’t get to the dishes today, there’s always tomorrow. Bad day I work, I’ll watch a movie and run the laundry, but it probably won’t get pulled from the dryer for a few days. \n\nOne of the best lessons I learned is that it’s better to do something halfway than not at all. And that works for me. When I was a kid, I would only complete half my homework (because of the undiagnosed adhd) but felt too shameful to turn in a half done assignment. I would end up not turning it in and get 0 credit instead of half credit. Learning that if I can only muster enough energy to do half of the dishes, or 1 load of laundry, or clean just the toilet instead of the whole bathroom has been a game changer. \n\nMy husband personal stance is that if you aren’t going to to do something all the way, then it’s better to not do it at all. Clearly this very must conflicts with my own self-regulation. \n\nI think this is more of a general statement on how others’ expectations conflict with how a person with ADHD would typically operate. I’m using my husband as an example of this but am not looking for a solution to our dynamic. I’m just trying to understand how to better balance my needs with those around me. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this?",

Hope this is helpful to someone out there!\n\n\"We appreciate your interest in Ironshore Pharmaceuticals products. We documented your inquiry as:\n\nQuestion: Hello,\nI am an ADHD patient who has been prescribed this medication for the first time. Is Jornay PM suitable for vegetarians.

He’s found a quirky loophole in the world of coaching where he’s able to succeed by hyperfixating on his players’ growth as people without caring too much about winning. He’s able to exploit this hack of the system by keeping a bunch of assistants around him who know what they’re doing and are organized—he wouldn’t have a job otherwise. And I think “be a goldfish” speaks for itself.\n\nIf he has ADHD, Ted has carved out a niche for himself in which he’s able to work with it rather than against it. Even if he doesn’t, there’s a lot of inspiration to take away from how his character interacts with the world. Maybe I’m projecting too much of my own stuff onto him, but he’s one of us, right?",

and i cannot bike in traffic or streets due to turns (right and left) and due to cars and walkers. once a car hit me and guy tried to force me into his car physically but i was more bothered about not being able to burn cals if kidnap, yes i do have an ed as well ED SWITCHES:\n- BED and emotional eating cos i struggle with emotions and cos i can sit still for tv shows only when eating the 4D X movies are only exception \n- binge and purge cos BED weight gain \n- restriction cos it s the only time i can feel organized and like i am achieving something\n- [ ] I do not like routines i am a spontenous and adventurous type but the only time i can be organized is when i have very fixated and ritualistic routines i hyperfocus on but then if routine gets slightly off and everything is moderately off i shut down again into spacing out and blocking out cos it s too much for me\n- [ ] right now everyone is proud of me for bpd and alcohol abuse recovery but i just hyperfocus on therapy, getting a fit body and good diet, staying organized by torturing myself and a salary raise\n\n- [ ] i lose motivation very easily if my progress is stagnating or going a bit backwards or if the progress is good but gets repetitive and boring. i start projects i never finish \nand this moment i feel like an attention seeker because i almost got tested in the past but they kept asking about my IQ and my IQ is between 120-130 (did the their stupid tests) but their comments hurt like let me explain comments hurt way more than a relationship ending through abandoment because neutraul or slightly negative comments feel like disapproval or i am boring and it pains me a lot \ni struggle a ton with time management cos the concept of time is so hard to gasp like it feels like it moves too slowly but when i am overwhelmed by external stimuli i just want to retreat for a long time but then i get bored and chase new things but i need them to do on my own because groups are too much i cannot pay attention to people yes i many times interrupt my colleagues during meetings\nand i work from home and i couldn t have an office job it would be too hard to pay attention not to dump into colleagues or furniture and a common kitchen aaah nightmare. also i am very sensitive to neutral or irritated facial expressions and i prefer to work with my laptop from home. i cannot multitask unless i am very focus and motivated on it and even then i can only multitask by tapping on things or my skin i dunno \n- [ ] i cannot sit still at all i forget things then i remember to do them but i cannot because of mental and physical block outs \ni am 90% too early or late because if i am not too early i will be late \nduring childhood i would have been described as with my head in the clouds clumsy then as a teenager as a procastinator and not motivated. i appear socially withdrawn but i love talking to people but it s so painfully hard to pay attention to them i get frustrated with myself and impatient with people a lot \ni dunno if i am a perfectionist or not because i basically cannot retain information but communication skills come naturally to me so they compensate and i do good at work and bosses are okay with me i make reckless mistakes and even if i realise i m gonna do a mistake i cannot physically and mentally stop my process of commiting it\nthere s much more but now i feel blue maybe will update my post. \nP.S.: i already started working on self helping coping strategies and do therapy but i also need a theory of what s going on with me at the core y know that answer on paper that you re not going insane or are just a dumb and lazy person? :\\",

It’s an itchy, prickly sensation that travels all over my body, is extremely uncomfortable, and prevents me from sitting still. It only happens when I’m tired—usually not during the daytime or when I have more energy.\n\nHas anyone else ever felt this?? It’s really frustrating when I’m attending a concert, going to the movies, or even lying on the couch at home. The only thing that solves it is going to bed. Wondering if anyone can relate! Thanks!",

They have some common characteristics.\n2. most, or nearly all, autistic people, and about half of people with ADHD, have some degree of sensory sensitivity.\n3. many people who are autistic also have ADHD — it is a common combination of conditions. I have seen estimates from 40% to 70% of autistics meeting the criteria for ADHD. The proportion of people with ADHD who are also autistic is much lower as there are a lot more people with ADHD.\n4. researchers gave found one or more genes that are known to increase the likelihood of both autism and ADHD, which might well explain the previous point.\n5. both ADHD and autism (along with bipolar disorder) are among the most highly genetic psychiatric conditions\n6. both groups of people tend to have social difficulties, although the details of their difficulties tend to be different (people with ADHD can easily lose friends because of their impulsivity and unreliability; while autistic people have differences in communication that lead to them not understanding neurotypicals and neurotypicals misinterpreting or avoiding autistics.)\n7. both groups of people tend to be blamed for behaviours that are really signs of their condition — neurotypical people think if they can do something then the autistic or ADHD person must be able to do it, and hence it is simply laziness or some similar *voluntary* characteristic that is the problem when autistic or ADHD people do not act the way that neurotypical people expect.\n\n[**#ADHD-tips**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Agreeable-Shift1482)",

        "text": " \n\nI can answer you from the perspective of someone with Adult ADHD that started in childhood, mother of three with ADHD, and now at least three of my grandchildren are diagnosed…\n\nFirst, **you need to \\*understand\\* us.** Our brains are literally wired differently. They’re calling it “Neural diversity” now, which I like because it really is just thinking differently, not so much like we’re crippled by some ‘disorder.’ But life for us is like having 35 tabs open in your browser, all on different topics across several genres, and knowing exactly how each one corralates to the others (I actually do this a lot, boggles my husband’s mind.) It’s like having five different radio stations going all at once in our heads, rock, talk radio, news, classical and reggae.\n\nAnd **we really** ***want*** **to be understood.** The biggest issues in relationships is when we feel the other person doesn’t understand us and we feel alone. My son had an issue over 20 years ago where he was being defiant in the principal’s office in the presence of a police officer. When I walked in, the cop was unclasping his handcuffs to take him to Juvenille hall. I sat in a child-sized chair in front of my son and said “So, what’s going on?” After 10 mins of being heard, he was calm and understood that his *response* to the situation was inappropriate (although I took issue because he was being bullied) and the officer said he’d never seen anyone so effectively handle an ADHD kid that wound up. I replied “All he wanted was for his feelings to be heard and understood.”\n\n**We feel very deeply.** We seem to get our feelings hurt pretty easily. Because we attach to the things that get our attention accutely, when they’re taken from us or otherwise destroyed, we feel like *we’re* being hurt. We’re often told we talk too much, because we want others to understand and feel things as muc has we do. And we don’t understand why people can go through life without feeling things like we do.\n\n**We’re not stupid.** I was tested and have a 167 IQ. And yet I forget simple things like remembering to set my alarm the night before so I make an appointment, or what I had for dinner last night. I can hear a song and tell you the song title, band name, and usually the album name, what the album cover looked like, the track, the lead singer, and often a bit of other trivia about the song, band or album. My husband calls me his “own personal ‘Behind the Music’.” Yet many ADHD kids grow up to be adults with a *lot* of self esteeme issues from being called lazy, stupid, crazy, spoiled or weird. They often have PTSD (and some like me have actual physical scars) from bullying, poor grades because they just don’t think like the other kids, and a high suicide rate.\n\n**We move at a very fast pace.** We thrive in situations were we can apply what we know and are good at in a focused manner. My ADHD son would be so into a video game he wouldn’t notice his bathroom urges and wet his pants as a teenager. If I’m working on an important project or event, I typically spend the last two weeks before the event in what my kids call “pre event psychosis” where I get almost zero sleep, only face-planting my keyboard for 15 mins at a time, with little side effects. My husband says he marvels at everything I do out-of-sight until he notices them or I bring them up. My grandparents used to call it “running circles around them” (sometimes literally.)\n\n**We want to be helpful, and involved.** We forget that people might not *want* our help, beause we’re so busy butting in trying to join in. We have so many ideas how you can improve what you’re doing that we don’t understand why you’re comfortable doing things the same way every time. Or by yourself. Or it’s not the best/fastest/most fun way possible. We don’t understand why people say “go away, I’ll do it myself” or “I don’t want your help.”\n\n**We’re easily distracted.** Scatter-brained. Forgetful. Spastic. For example the other day I was sitting at my desk writing a fiction story on my computer, fixing a USB charging cord, making a short grocery list, organizing my top desk drawer and talking to people in the room, all at the same time. I also fed the fish on my desk, and periodically swapped out the page of the document I was scanning into my computer. What most people don’t understand is that ADHD people can actually *do* that, and we’re usually *good* at it. We will also have a thousand and one unfinished projects.\n\n**We need different coping mechanisms.** For some ADHD people, they need quiet to function, to keep the distractions limited. Me, I like to listen to music, preferably non-lyrical like “handpan” music or binural tones. Something with energy. I put headphones on and five hours later I have the outline of a small novel (and sometimes that’s bad, because it started as a simple reply on facebook that went WAY out of control!!) However, if my husband can’t find something in the fridge, without looking up from my computer I can say “second shelf, towards the back, under the sour cream behind the mayo.” And my office area that looks so cluttered and disorganized? I know what and where everything is, so please don’t move anything.\n\n**Yet we’re visionary too!** Some of the best writers, philosophers and scientists were or are ADHD. We think outside the box so much, we forget to think \\*inside\\* the box, and “Neuraltypical” people don’t have a reference in normal thinking to understand what we’re talking about. It’s not anyone’s fault, we literaly have a different perspective on the world. We can imagine all the “what ifs” in the universe (which can challenge even the most patient parent.) But we’re usually very good problem solvers, inventors and creators.\n\n**We get easily frustrated.** Because we move at such a fast pace, we have trouble learning the rest of the world dosen’t manifest things as fast as we’d like. We want to be instant Mozarts and Wozniaks, we want the paint to dry faster, we want our TV show to come on *now*, we want to arrive at our destination as soon as we pull out of the driveway (are we there yet?) We can be pushy and demanding beause we want things to go at our speed. And if we *grasp* a concept, we want to move on to the next step, whether the people around us are on the same page or not.\n\n**We also have trouble slowing down,** which is why things like belly breathing, grounding and centering, meditation, yoga, martial arts or even simple playtime in the bath can improve our mood and behavior rather impressively. *Learning to do* these things is hard for us though…\n\n**We get easily depressed.** The problem with moving fast in a slower paced world is that we get disapointed on a regular basis. We’re different, and a lot of ADHD people describe feeling like a “Stranger in a Strange Land” (good book by the way…) With all the expectations we have of ourselves and our world, and the disapointment from them, people with ADHD have some of the highest rates of mental health disorders and suicidal ideation overall. (It’s also why learning how to adjust one’s perspective and let go of expectations and live in the now is so theraputic for us.)\n\n**Our brains specialize.** Much like a savant, we’re usually *really* good at something, but lackluster at most of the other things around us. When we fixate on a topic or field, it’s one of the few times that we are able to shut out the distractions, and so we excel at that thing. The drawback is that it’s also really hard to get interested in anything else. If we’re good at math in school, we don’t hear the bell ring ending the class, we get distracted at our locker looking \\*one more time\\* at those equasions, and we miss 90% of everything the next four teachers talk about because in our head we’re seeing numbers and fractions and sums. (As you can tell, mine was English class, adding sociology in college.)\n\n**The best way you can help us is to understand us.** Be patient. Be kind. Don’t get angry when we try to help. Or when we don’t remember. Learn more about how we think and approach us from our perspective once in a while. Help us set up the structures, reminders and mechanisms that help us function. Or at least try not to throw us off-track if we’re doing good.\n\n**For kids**, give them *lots* of stuff to do, but make sure it’s something that catches their interest. Don’t be surprised when that interest changes overnight. Learn the concept of a “teaching moment.” In those moments, you have their attention - use it to teach them why the situation is good or bad. Don’t nag about the failures or differences as much as recognizing and praising the successes. ADHD people have so many little failures throughout the day that praising us for a success goes a log way.\n\n*Realize they are mini adrenaline junkies!* My daughter’s teacher realized she needed to be evaluated at seven when, instead of going around the table like most her peers at that age would, to get a marker she wanted she not only went across the table for it, but she did so standing, not crawling, and didn’t understand why it was such an issue. I loved to climb trees, big tall pine trees, all the way where I could touch the top, despite it swaying from my weight, or my mother’s terrified screams.\n\n*Make them learn to read,* without it they will have trouble finding coping mechanisms because neuraltypical people don’t think like they do, but in the myriad of universes and galaxies in stories they can find descriptions of things that their minds will connect with.\n\nAnd it goes without saying I hope that most of all, we’re human. We deserve the same love and respect you would give anyone else. And if you do, you’ll find no better or more loyal helpers in all of society. Just let us be us.",

        "text": "Basically, a few years ago, I was diagnosed with autism/ASD. Till then, everyone ironically had thought I rather had ADHD. Mostly due to my constant hyperactive rocking back and forth and issues of concentrating.\n\n During my main test, I was hence also tested on ADHD. The test was...odd. I got a paper with lines of \"p\"s. Some of these p's were \"wrong\", aka q's &amp; b's and I had to mark them out during a specific time. Like, 1min for crossing out one line, 10 lines on paper. The test was done twice over two days.\nBecause I could concentrate enough, I was diagnosed as negative. Which was fine -I wasn't going to challenge a professional diagnosis. But I admit that the test was still very weird to me.\n\nAs years went by, things kept being troublesome for me. Though I did not have ADHD (officially), I had clear executive dysfunction. No matter what I did, no matter the context, everything with structure was seemingly against me: From constantly missing homework, to getting lost on simple, easy streets. I also can't get somewhere in time, except it's a direct threat to my life or existence. EVEN IF I want to be in time. Even IF I try to put structures in place. Furthermore, I also had trouble in school: Any essay was marked worse, because \"I didn't get to the point\". Even in college, no matter how often I wrote essays, it never was per se coherent. Like -it got better. But it seemed like the issues were always hiding in dead man's corners until someone points them out to me. \n\nThings came to a shove a few days ago: In a college paper, I missed to correctly quote a very tricky quote. Overall, I butchered the entire thing, but the quote was the queen-kicker; I nearly got kicked for plagarism (I was let go, because it was my first paper). At that point I realized I might have a deeper issue. Maybe my issues weren't just lack of discipline and skill. Maybe I needed some serious help.\n\nTalking about it online, many see my issues as undiagnosed ADHD again. I was first adamant it's not -just ASD and other stuff (like depression, MDD etc.), but then the p's came back to haunt me. Like... not shitting on the head of our psychiatry, but he was the same guy who tried to tell me that I didn't have depression, because \"teenage girls get moody and depressed all the time\"\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. How do you know that a test is competent or not? Were the P's right? I'm trying to get some resources over our college, though I'm too low-support needs for disability. So idk",

        "text": "A few months ago, a psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed me with Vyvanse. I have been seeing him every two weeks to adjust the dosage in order to alleviate my symptoms. However, despite taking the highest dose of Vyvanse (70mg) for the past two weeks, my psychiatrist noticed that it was not fully treating my symptoms, including executive dysfunction, task initiation, time blindness, and my tendency to hyperfixate on everything except the task at hand.\n\nYesterday I had another routine check-up and he switched me to a different medication called Concerta XL? Once I get my prescription, I have to take 54mg of Concerta XL in the morning and a smaller dose of 18mg at mid-day. \n\nBasically, what I am asking is what should I expect? Should I actually feel hopeful that this medication would do anything different? I guess I am feeling a bit cynical because I expected Vyvanse to just \"fix\" everything and when it didn’t, I reasoned that I can't have it all and I should feel content with it making me feel calmer and generally more focused. But now my doctor is saying that it should at least be assisting with those other symptoms.\n\nIt doesn't help that I am doing an incredibly academically challenging course and its structure/content is fundamentally incompatible with ADHD. Realistically I know that I am not dumb, I wouldn't even have been eligible in doing this course if I was, but from the coursework and the deadlines to the sheer variety of subjects that I am required to do, I feel like I am drowning. I guess I don't believe that I even have ADHD. I know logically that can't be possible. The number of specialists I saw and teachers that reaffirmed all can tell me otherwise.\n\nBefore I actually started taking the medication, everyone was preaching like it was some kind of miracle cure. But now that I'm on it, it's hard to tell if it's even working. \n\nAnyways, coming out of that tangent, does Concerta work differently to Vyvanse? \n\nTLDR: Switching from Vyvanse to Concerta. Would I notice any change?",
