        "text": "I currently work in a Print Hub and mentioned in a previous post that Malicious Compliance kind of just comes with the job. Here is another one that I just learned the outcome for this week.\n\nI had been on medical leave for quite some time. During that time, a number of systems and programs we used changed. In particular our online systems for business cards and similar products had changed. The way the system was before my leave was that when a customer uploaded the file, the system would slightly stretch the file to include a bleed. If a file was submitted with a bleed, nothing would be done.\n\nFor those not in the know, a bleed on a print file is an excess of the image in the design that is meant to be cut off. This ensures that there is no ugly, uneven white edge on the finished product.\n\nAstute readers would realize our old system could cause issues however, especially when writing or images are close to borders. Information could be cut off due to being over the bleed line after the image was stretched. As such we as workers knew that a change was going to happen.\n\nThis change happened during my medical leave, as the online system was updated to allow more customizations. When customers uploaded files they were presented with a digital canvas where they could change their text and images on their file. Two boxes were presented on this canvas, one box showing the finished size of the product, and one showing the bleed we needed to ensure a proper cut.\n\nThe problem is, the system no longer automatically stretched the provided file to the finished size, and certainly not to the bleed size. The new system allows customers to properly fit themselves, but rarely do they size it to bleed.\n\nAs such, when we print and cut the finished product, there is often this ugly white band on two of the sides. As the cutting system is all automated, and without those bleeds there were always problems. Additionally, our large Guillotine Cutter is constantly in use for orders that need it, and to reprogram it and interrupt orders to trim a millimeter off every order was unreasonable.\n\nMy manager, who will be named Dee, brought this to the attention of the system admins and IT, but was pretty much dismissed. He was told to push those orders that did not have bleed into problem status, and they would take a look at the problem. Also to send a list of problem orders still not handled at the end of each week.\n\nWhen I returned to work three months ago, I was given a run down of everything that was new, including this new problem. I followed this Malicious Compliance currently in progress, none the wiser to what Dee was doing, pushing the orders without bleed into problem status, which was quite a fair amount to be honest. I didn't really think much about it however.\n\nTowards the beginning of this month, Dee had asked me to scan in February's problem orders, easily 500 orders, ensure each problem was its own separate file then file them in a filing cabinet out back. (I have read/listened to horror stories about office scanning, but I don't really have an issue where I am as we have a high capacity, automated scanner, so this was no issue) I did as I was told, in the folder they told me to put it in on the shared computer and then went to file it.\n\nThere were over thousands of problem orders stuck in limbo due this bleed issue in this filing cabinet. Not only did this likely make us look bad to Head Office, but the customers were probably pissed. When I asked Dee what was going on with this issue, he explained everything, and informed me of his plan.\n\nIt turned out IT intended to do nothing about this bleed problem. They wanted us as Production to fix the problem, which meant designing. The Design Team gets paid *a lot* more than we in production though, and as we weren't being paid that wage, Dee was having none of it.\n\nHe was told each week to send in all orders that haven't been fixed as of yet, so he was. Dee and the supervisor created a program that would submit each problem order as a ticket to IT, one at a time, at the end of the week. Previously, they had sent everything in as one ticket. This is why they had me scan each problem order as its own file, rather than just a single PDF with everything in it.\n\nThis program ran on Friday, late afternoon, just before IT's weekend started. Dee knew IT needed to acknowledge all problem tickets before they left the office. Every 15 seconds a new problem ticket popped up and they needed to acknowledge it, all 500 files, before they left. I don't know exactly how well it worked, but it certainly worked. Two hours, five minutes after hours at least, depending how fast their PCs are. I did the math, and that's only the stuff that I scanned myself.\n\nFrom my understanding, Dee and Supervisor had also decompiled the files they had already submitted and resubmitted them as well.\n\nAfter the first week the Regional Manager (who is a really cool guy, we'll call him Ray) stopped by to check in and asked why IT was cursing Dee's name and Dee explained it. Ray said, in no uncertain terms. \"If they haven't done anything about the jobs by the end of the week, you should follow up. *Wink*\"\n\nAt the end of last week, Dee set up the program to ask for updates on each of the problem jobs, as well as the program to submit new problem jobs from last week, and set it to run.\n\nWhen we came in this Monday we got an update from IT that the system has been adjusted, and customers should not be able to submit jobs anymore that \"Do not have borders meeting the Bleed Line.\" We still have some issues as reorders can override this fix, but it's been a lot better now and this week has been extremely productive.\n\nDee, meanwhile, came into his email having over 20 unread messages, and over 500 junk mail as the spam filter kicked in. Each message was the program's response asking for an update, with the first few responses from IT being \"We are still looking into it.\" and the later responses simply being the letter A.\n\nThere is still the matter of the orders still stuck in Limbo, so there may be an update, but the main Compliance has been settled.",

        "text": "So I work as an engineer for a service company. Usually my position gets awarded a stipend for a truck, aka truck allowance. Half the time I’m at the office, the other half I’m visiting jobsites and construction sites. \nSo, the three options are, Lease a company vehicle(extremely discounted rate), Truck allowance, or a company provided service vehicle(which as an engineer I don’t need )\nThe issue is I don’t want yet another vehicle in my driveway.  So I went with the truck allowance option seeing as how I have a personal truck.  However, for some stupid reason there has to be a minimum mount of miles driven in a year to get the stipend.  That normally is not typical.\nThe idea being, I don’t drive enough to need a full-time company provided service vehicle.  \nAt the high end, the truck allowance is around $500 a month which equates to about 30,000 in five years. \nA company provided service vehicle is twice that. With a ladder, racks, toolboxes, insurance, gas card, up keep, it isn’t cheap.\nSo in short $500 a month is a no-brainer, right?  Other companies I worked for couldn’t write the check fast enough.  Not this company. \n“Sir, that’s just company policy…”\n\nFine, if you’re gonna be that dumb. Go ahead and send me the brand new truck I guess.  \nAnd then they wonder why customers complain about the price for service.",

Basically, the teacher would spend the first part of class discussing recent news, then we would talk about politics or government or something. I don't think the class was well defined. The teacher did her best, though.\n\nEvery day in this class, the teacher would ask the students if there was anything on the news that they wanted to discuss. There would be a long, awkward silence until somebody remembered something. When an answer finally came, the teacher would talk about it, what it meant to the local and national situation, how it affected us as students, and so on. Naturally, as a middle schooler, I had zero interest in the news. I spent this class reading the comics from the newspapers they provided in the lunch room. But if nobody brought up a news story, then she would shift to interactive work, and I had to pay proper attention.\n\nI realized that if I brought in the comics AND the front page, then I could wait until there was a lull in the discussion, then I would skim the front page, ask about an article there, and she would talk for the next 10-15 minutes about it. I could keep her going for half the class. I don't know if she never caught on or if she didn't mind, but it worked.",

He said yeah, loaded her up in the back of his truck and brought her over. We hung out, watched the goat do her job, and watched my neighbors watch my goat do her job. I knew that even if the HOA didn't like it, there was nothing they could do about it. We aren't allowed to raise livestock, sure. But if, say, the HOA presidents daughter wants a pony at her birthday, then its okay for them to hang out for a few hours.

        "text": "*This happened decades ago.  English is my first and only language, but I'm not bothered enough to proofread this.  I was reminded of this after seeing someone else talk about how bad it must be for both teacher and students in the age of AI.*\n\nI had a pretty lousy teacher for eight grade social studies.  To give you an idea of this, there was a unit where she asked the class if anyone seriously - *seriously* \\- thought they would want to be president some day, and would explain that something like that needs to be your calling.  Someone asked her if  teaching was her calling, and after pausing, she answered honestly: no.\n\nNow, on with the story. \n\nOne of the bigger projects we had was called News Summary or something like that.  The point was simple: to encourage us to be aware of current events, we were required to read, watch, or listen to the news and write three-sentence summaries.  No citations or sources needed; she just wanted to see that we were informed about things in the news.  Piece of cake.  I wrote my summaries, turned them in, and thought nothing more of it.\n\nI still thought nothing of it a couple days later, when she spent the entire class ranting about ethics and plagiarism.  You know how you feel when someone calls a meeting to admonish and entire group for something that someone did wrong?  That \"why am I stuck listening to this crap\" feeling? That was me.  At one point, she asked everyone to close their eyes, and said \"raise your hand if you'd like another shot at the project\".   So now imagine my shock when, at the end of class, she asks me to stay behind.\n\n\"You've always been one of my better students.  I'm really surprised you didn't speak up in class today.\"\n\n\"Speak up?  About what?\"\n\n\"When I asked for hands.\"\n\nI'm really confused and don't know what to say.  So after a long pause, she lays it out.  She \"knows\" that all of my summaries are plagiarized because \"no eighth-grader writes like they're writing for a newspaper\", but she can't prove it because she doesn't know if I just listened to a newscast and wrote down what they said.  This was back before everything was online, mind you.  I didn't know how to respond, and I had to get to my next class, so I left quite confused and unsure what this accusation would mean.\n\nWell, when I got home from school that day, my mom was quick to tell me that she'd had an interesting phone call with my teacher.  And here's the good news: not only was my mom always supportive of me as a child, she literally watched me doing this project, and she still had all the source material - newspapers that were a few weeks old, so they weren't in the pile of things that the teacher would have easily found at work (papers got discarded at the end of the week).  She probably could have found the papers at the library, but again, this is someone who admitted to the class at one point that teaching wasn't really her calling.\n\nThe plan my mom had worked out with the teacher during this phone call was that I could produce proof that I wasn't plagiarizing, and we'd forget this whole thing ever happened.  My mom was so livid during this phone call that she also didn't really think to just say \"we have the papers at home, we'll bring them in tomorrow\".  The teacher said I had until the end of the week to provide proof, which is good, because the scheme that finally started hatching in my head couldn't be put into place overnight.\n\nSee, the thing about our local paper is that the Letters to the Editor page would print nearly anything as long as it wasn't an absolutely crackpot rant from someone who sounded like they belonged in an institution.  So after racking my brain, I wrote a letter that complied with their length limit, which I think was 150 characters. The gist of it was that I was noticing more and more that I had a number of friends who were showing real aptitude for different things at school as they entered their teenage years, be it the arts like music and writing, or athletics, or philosophy, but teachers kept downplaying their aptitudes and interests in order to push the notion that the only thing that mattered was being able to pass your middle school exams.  It was, I wrote, discouraging to see my friends' talents and interests being so casually dismissed.  Admittedly, I took some liberties here, as most of my friends were actually just doing what they needed to pass with good grades.  But I had a point to make.\n\nThree days later, I handed in my stack of source material after class.  Attached last in the pile: the letter, with my name, age (required for anyone under 18), and town printed beneath it, published in the newspaper.  In hindsight, I wish I would have included a Post-it note with it just to speak more directly to my point.  But there was no mistaking the message from that note: it's not hard for an eighth-grader to write \"like they're writing for the newspaper\".  I stayed to make sure she read *all* of the clippings, and after a very awkward pause, I was told I could go to my next class.\n\nAdmittedly, there's no dramatic fallout from this.  She quietly replaced my grade of zero with an A, the rest of the school year was perfectly boring, and she continued to teach until she could afford to retire.  I did hear later on, however, that she stopped doing the News Summary project.  I can't imagine why.",

        "text": "Obligatory: This was about 5-6 years ago. I was doing some last minute Christmas shopping during the holiday season at my local Walmart. I had over $100 dollars in items 2 of which were rolls of wrapping paper. Having been an employee at Walmart where I was quite frequently called up as a back up cashier, I was quite fast at scanning items and as such usually used the self checkout because it goes quite quick for me. None of the items I had purchased were something you'd return so I promptly pitched my receipt in the waste basket next to the self checkout I had just used and promptly headed for the exit, all of my items in my cart are in bags except for the two giant rolls of wrapping paper because... Why would I put them in bags? That's just silly.\n\nAs I get close to the exit I observe one lady who appears to be well into her 60s standing next to a girl who I doubt was more than 18. As I go to exit the store the older lady steps in front of me and demands to see my receipt. Having worked for this shitty company I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder I asked why she needed to see my receipt, the conversation went something like this:\n\nHer: I need to see your receipt ( in a demanding tone)\n\nMe: why would that be?\n\nHer: because you have unbagged items\n\nMe:.... because It's wrapping paper. \n\nHer: let me see your receipt.\n\nMe: I don't have it. I threw it in the trash at one of the self checkouts\n\nShe quickly rushes over to check the trash.\n\nHer: it's not in here.\n\nI shrug and tell her that I'm not required to show her anything and that she can't keep me in the store by law and I'm going to leave now. She goes into a frenzy shouting \"mark that one down!\" To the young girl with the clipboard. I can only assume that they were writing down the time and description of possible theft scenarios.\n\nAfter that incident I've put every single thing I've ever purchased from Walmart in a bag or at bare minimum I will put it over the corner of the box or as far into the bag as I can get it. 24 pack of soda? Yep in a bag it goes. my kids pack and play? Yep that's getting bags wherever I can fit them. And if I were to buy a TV from Walmart you better believe every single corner is getting a bag out on it. It doesn't matter what it is, no matter how obnoxious. Every. Single. Item. Every. Single.Time.\n\nThe looks I get from unknowing cashiers as I calmly wrap bags around my basically unbaggable items are hilarious. But I keep it together with a slight smile and say \"wouldn't want anyone to think I was stealing!\" And from time to time I do get stopped to ask for my receipt for my \" unbagged items\" to which I politely point out my item does indeed have a bag. I simply get a dumb founded look in reply. Not once has an employee continued to ask for my receipt after pointing out the bag. And I'm going to keep doing it until the end of time... And yes that goes the same for any wrapping paper I might purchase.\n\nTL;DR: Shitty old Walmart employee makes a scene and accuses me of being a thief due to not having my wrapping paper in bags. Ever since I put everything I buy  in bags one way or another no matter how obnoxious.",

It took over 10 minutes for my nephew to get “smokebreak” to understand that while weed is legal, their employer and most companies prohibit being under its influence while at work.  It was also pointed out to “smokebreak” that alcohol is legal but MOST employers don’t want you knocking back a cold one or two during your lunch break. Employers don’t need or want the liability of inebriated employees, especially when they’re operating machinery.  “Smokebreak” accepted that he was going to be terminated but appreciated that they were not going to tell his job placement agency or future employers specifically why, “he didn’t work out” at the warehouse.",

        "text": "I posted this over in r/ServerLife and someone suggested this would fit well here.\n\nI’m a bartender, and this last weekend a guy comes in with his friend and sits at the bar. They order some greasy food and a couple bloodies to “combat the hangover”. \n\nOne of them orders something that we’re out of, that I didn’t realize was 86’d when he ordered it. I go to put in their order, realize it, come back and apologize and they’re chill about it, but he makes a “I’d like to talk to your manager” joke (he’s laughing the whole time). I play along and say something dumb like “you know what, we just ran out of those too” and they’re laughing. \n\nBut for the rest of their visit, every time I check on them (about 3 bloodies deep each at this point) he WONT let it go. “I’m still waiting to talk to the manager”. At one point I get worried that he’s serious and stare at him and say “Do you actually want to speak to a manager? Because I can get one for you”. He stared back at me for a good minute, and then laughed and said “no dude I’m just messing with you.” But STILL won’t let it die. \n\nNext time I go over to check on them, a manager is behind the bar getting some stuff for the floor and he says it again. I smile bc this manager is the BEST. Great with customers but always has our back first and foremost. And she is up to her neck in bullshit this particular day, and is NOT HAVING ANYTHING. (We call her our saint and mother Mary). He asks again, I say “are you sure you want to do that? She’s having a pretty bad day”. He says yes. I say, “sure she’s right here”. Guy looks delighted. \n\nMary looks concerned, comes over and asks him what the problem is. He immediately starts backtracking, saying “no everything’s fine, that’s just been ‘our joke’” today”, and she is not having any of it. She’s like “no if there’s a problem, please let me know”. Guy insists there is no problem, he’s just messing around. Mary goes off on him. She’s like “are you kidding me right now? I don’t have the time for this.” Saying how disrespectful this is, how there’s people who actually need help rn, how they’re wasting my time and making me look bad at the bar, basically saying “why would you pretend about something like that? either tell me your problem or fuck off”. Guy immediately regrets his decision. The fear on his face is palpable. I walk up in the aftermath and he says NOTHING. I say “I told you she’s having a bad day.”\n\nThey still tipped me well.",

        "text": "It's been years, but I'm still worried that this person is going to hunt me down in my sleep, hence the throwaway. I used to work at a deli shop-slash-cafe place, just to make ends meet while I went to uni, and the owner of that place was a real piece of work. If you got on her bad side, you were on the shit list, and she would be both openly and passively aggressive with the general vibe that you were an incompetent idiot no matter what you did. I heard that woman scream at a fifteen-year-old on her second day because she had mixed up coffee and tea cups, which differed in size by about an ounce, just to give you an idea of her personality. \n\nAfter this whole experience my dad told me that, as a general hint, it may be good to be suspicious if a workplace hires exclusively teen girls with no experience, because they're very unlikely to recognise shitty workplace treatment. There were two people in this place who didn't take her shit; me, a mid-20s recovering addict who's seen way worse and a 45-year-old Iranian man who told her she could go fuck herself when she berated him for not being willing to come in early to his eleven-hour shift to prep ingredients (off the clock, of course). I liked that dude.\n\nWith the stage set, onto the malicious compliance. When I started, this place desperately needed a new wheel meat slicer. The one they had made a constant screeching noise and drove everyone crazy. About a month and a half into my employment, they got one. Industrial grade, cost five thousand bucks, both looked and worked accordingly. Amazing piece of kit. \n\nAs we were all celebrating and unpacking it, I flip through the instruction booklet to look up how it works and specifically how to clean it as there were quite a few parts. Manual says to clean everything detachable thoroughly, but that the wheel itself should be cleaned by letting it run on very low speed (with safety precautions) and using a cloth and alcohol-based cleaning agent on the exposed part. There were some pictures and detailed instructions on how to do this, and it explicitly stated *not* to take the whole wheel off and deep clean it as this would remove the wheel lubricant/anti-corrosive agent and risk damage to the machine, and to especially not let water or any cleaning agents get into the machine without making sure to thoroughly replace any lubricant. \n\nI was working the evening shift, so 99% of the time it was up to me to clean it. The instructions is how I clean the machine, because I trust the designer to know how to clean it. Or, I do for about two days until my boss sees me, asks what the fuck I'm doing and why I'm not taking the wheel off to clean it. She berates me about food safety and hygiene standards, telling me how disgusting I am for doing it this way. I stand my ground and inform her I do it this way because of the instructions, that I'm following the manual, and explain the reason behind it. If we scrub it down, especially the inner part, the grease will go away a lot faster and we'll risk damage to the machine. She basically tells me to shove it and to do it her way.\n\nNow, I'm not gonna ruin a 5000 dollar thing because one woman doesn't understand how lubrication works, but the very next day my manager sees me clean the machine and gives me an extremely condescending talk-down on how \"this isn't how we approach hygiene\" and how \"boss told me you don't seem to understand food safety\". My explanation falls on deaf ears again, and I'm also informed not only am I expected to take the wheel off and scrub it at the end of the day, but *after every us*e. Boss also wants me to make sure I spray off the inside section to insure there's no bacteria in there, with some hints that there'd apparently been a whole colony of life growing in there due to my two-day negligence.\n\nShe wants me to spray soap and water mixture into the cogs of a machine they just bought. The blade is stainless steel, but the fucking cogs aren't. Fucking fine. If that's what you want me to do, that's what I will do. Every day, five times a day, I take that fucking machine apart and scrub it down. Every day I see that lubrication disappear more and more, and after a week it's all gone, eventually becoming replaced by growing patches of rust. I feel bad for the machine, but I do as I've been told. I only work six days a week, so every day I come in after my break thinking that *surely* yesterday my manager would've reacted. Nope. She takes it apart just like I do, clean it like I do, and doesn't seem to think twice about the fact that this brand new machine is rusting apart in front of our eyes. In fact, she goes the extra mile and also scrubs the cog itself, which is probably why a year or so worth of lubricant disappeared in one week.\n\nThe thing about rusty machinery is that it usually works up until a certain point, but once it reaches that point, there's no going back. One day, I turn it on, and it makes a screeching noise I can only imagine came from the soul of this bit of kit wondering why God has forsaken it, and it's like the clocks all stop. My coworker in the pastry section comes over to ask what the FUCK that noise is, my boss and manager come into the room with the same question, and I just shrug and slice my salami. Boss tells her co-owner to go get some lubrication for the gears, and after a minute he puts some fucking spray-on 445 in front of me and tells me to lube the gears up. I ask him where the lithium lubricant paste is, since according to the instructions that's what you need, and he seems flabbergasted that putting something made for hinges and wheelhouses isn't appropriate for a meat slicer. \n\nTwo days and some tinnitus later, he's acquired some grease, and then proceeds to be stumped when I let him know I'm not gonna stop doing my regular job to spend thirty minutes greasing up this machine unless someone else takes over my station or they pay me overtime. My boss is meanwhile demanding to know why I haven't told them we needed to stock up on lithium grease, which I don't even bother to respond to. I make sandwiches. I'm not your mechanic. \n\nI left that job a few weeks later, and when I did the machine was still crying the song of its ancestors every time we turned it on. And we were still scrubbing it down from the inside out daily, of course. I have since then gotten a sneaking suspicion I know what happened to its predecessor, and me and my dad - who is actually a mechanic - still laugh about it sometimes. \n\nMy boss did ask, rhetorically, at one point how the hell the machine got to that stage so fast. I answered that it's probably because we've ben scrubbing the lubrication and corrosion protection off several times a day, and I take great pleasure in the memory that she completely ignored me. It's the only time while I was there that she didn't snap back at me, and I like to think she remembered back to when I explicitly told her that if we clean this thing in that way, this is exactly what would happen. Overall I don't think a 5k machine would make or break anything, but fuck me did that feel good.",

        "text": "My sister just reminded me about this story, it takes place in 2017. I'm on mobile, forgive any formatting errors, but definitely come at me for spelling mistakes. \n\n\n\nShe and I were out for brunch and had a lovely time at an upscale rooftop restaurant in the heart of our city. Y'know, the kind with a full setting, cloth napkins, and white tablecloth. The kind where a pancake entrée has the word \"melange\" and mimosas are $16. \n\n\nWe had a great time even though the service was a little rushed, we get it - Saturday brunch means a lot of tables with a speedy turnover. My sister had been a waitress all through college, we even joked about her applying for the weekend shifts since she'd make great tips.\n\n\nWhen it came time to settle the check, we noticed we had been charged for two coffees, which we didn't order nor receive. While handing the bill back, I ask that they be taken off. \n\n\nWaiter: Well, you got coffee. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, we actually didn't. See? *Shows him the pristine empty coffee cups* \n\n\nWaiter: No, there's two coffee cups on the table.\n\n\nMe: There are coffee cups on *every* table. \n\nAt this point he kind of huffs and rolls his eyes, and says he doesn't have the authority to remove anything from the bill. Before I can ask for someone who can, he smirks and says the manager on duty just went on break and we'd have to wait 30 minutes for her, but he'd be asking us to wait at the host stand since they need the table.  \n\nMy sister and I look at each other and we both get the same idea. \n\n\n\nSister: Well, okay. Guess if we're being charged for coffee, I'd like a refill.\n\nMe: Oh, for me too. And can you bring cream and sugar?\n\n\nIt was at this moment he knew he fucked up. We spent another 20 minutes sipping coffee and keeping him from turning the table. We asked for refills once, and I asked if they had any raw sugar packets. \n\n\nBy the end of it he was pointedly ignoring us. We kinda giggled about it, and I made a very dramatic show of flourishing my card, putting it in the booklet, and setting it upright. My sister even tried to flag him down but he refused to look in our direction. \n\n\nWe finished and hung around until he came back with his manager. He was smirking again. Big lips, that guy. I have to say that facial expression stayed with me. \n\n\nWaiter (sickly sweet): Okay you two, we have a seating time limit to allow our other guests the opportunity to eat with us. Will that be all today? \n\n\nMe: Well, we've been waiting for you to take our check. I was trying to get your attention earlier, but you must have been busy. \n\n\n\nI offer him my card and the booklet, and I've never seen a human turn red so quickly. He mutters that he'll be right back and marches off to run it. While we were waiting, the manager asked us about our experience. We said we both had a great time, and we'd be back, and relayed what happened. At least we ended up enjoying the coffee. \n\n\nWe paid, left a decent tip, and skedaddled. But it felt good knowing he probably cost himself a ticket's worth of tips over $9 in coffee.",

        "text": "Hi there! Looking for some malicious compliance solutions to our new property manager’s very stupid rules. \nFiancé and I have lived in our apartment for 3 lovely years. Outside of lack of available parking and the occasional minor HVAC or plumbing issue, this place was amazing. No frills but exactly what we need, and very reasonably priced. \nA new management company took over at the beginning of 2023, and they are the absolute worst. They started by increasing our rent by 38% effective when our lease expires. They’ve been ordering a TON of new items to renovate the leasing office and other apartments and have been leaving them in our lobby, causing a tripping hazard for everyone in our building, especially outside of our mailboxes. \nLast week, I came home to find a management golf cart parked in the resident spot right outside our building, and the company car spot empty. I parked in the company spot. The following day, there was a tow warning on my car. I went into the leasing office and told management that I’d stop parking in their spot when they stop parking in resident spots. \nYesterday we received an email that they would be painting and updating the hallway and apartment door, which may cause noise and odors. Fine, whatever. We were told to bring our doormats, door decor, etc inside. Makes sense. The email then went on to say that we were no longer allowed to have any personal affects outside our apartments—in other words, the doormat and homemade wreath we love are no longer usable. \nMy fiancé and I lost it. They have been acting like a really strict HOA, and we want out (not for lack of trying—the housing market in our area is still so insane that we’ve lost several bids to buyers bidding over asking price). It broke our hearts to come home to our friendly neighbor’s door empty and sterile. \nIs there anything we can keep outside our apartment that would be illegal for them to remove? We’re thinking symbols of the Church of Satan. Honestly, anything to get around this rule would be awesome. Thanks!",

        "text": "Back in the 90s I was an irrigation tech working in downtown DC. One of my jobs was an office building directly across from the FBI HQ on Penn avenue. Not only was traffic terrible and parking non-existent, It was a highly secure building. A few years prior, a paralegal working on Saturday was raped and beaten by a perp who had walked in off the street. So every door and stairwell in the building had badge operated locked doors. You had to call a security guard to be escorted anywhere inside.\n\nOn the 11th floor was where most of the executive offices were located. It was surrounded by a mezzanine with some fancy landscaping and there was irrigation to water it. You accessed it through a locked window door in one of the offices. Now this will be important later. The controls for the irrigation were located inside the stairwell.\n\nSo when I had work scheduled there once I finally found a place to park I would try to load up every single tool and part I needed so I didn't have to make trips up and down. You could ring security in the parking garage and the guard would come down and escort you up the elevator. That was the only way you were allowed access.\n\nWhen you worked on the irrigation you had to access the controls to be able to turn it on and off and test it. To do so, I had to walk back through the office  to the stairwell where the controller was mounted. But the stairwell door would lock behind you and to get back to the mezzanine you had to take the stairs to the garage level and call for the guard to bring you back up the elevator. So even though it was against protocol, I would usually wedge something in the door to keep it open. I knew it wasn't protocol but it wasn't like anyone off the street would be able to get into the offices. To even get into the stairwell from the garage you had to have a badge to open the door. So I wasn't really putting anyone in danger.\n\nWell one day I had the door wedged open so I couod go back and forth to the controller and the guard saw it. He yelled at me about leaving it open and told me it always had to be locked . I was cool with that but then he must have told his boss about it. The management company called my boss and complained. They threatened to pull the contract and I got my ass chewed up and down the next day. If it happened again, I might even be fired.\n\nNot going to lie. I was a little pissed. I knew I was in the wrong about leaving the door open but the guard didn't have to be a dick and take it up the chain of command the very first time. Cue the malicious compliance. \n\nOn my next service call after parking the truck I  grabbed my bucket with some tools in it and called for the guard and I got escorted to the 11th floor. I waited about 5 minutes, then walked down the stairwell to the garage to grab parts, then called for the escort back up.\n\nI waited about 5 more minutes. Then I took the stairwell to the garage and got some more parts then called for the escort back up again. You can see where this is going. So after multiple trips up and down I finally had all the parts I needed and did the work. The guard was already getting pretty annoyed but hey, what can he say? I'm following protocol. \n\nThen I got to the part where I was going into the stairwell to test the system with the controller and reset the program. Every single time, for every single test or change, The stairwell door would lock behind me and I would take the stairs to the garage and call that same guard again for the escort back upstairs. For those of you wondering why the guard just didn't open the stairwell door for me, it was because in order for me to contact him, I had to go back to the garage level and use the phone there. No cell phones back in those days. And he had other places he needed to be and couldn't just stand there and watch me while it was working. \n\nI could tell the guard was getting really pissed now but he didn't dare say a word because he was the one that complained originally about me leaving the stairwell door open. The shittier the look on his face got the bigger the shit eating grin got on mine. He knew by then that I was doing it on purpose but there wasn't anything he could do about it. \n\nI know it was my mistake to begin with but he shouldn't have been such a jerk and tried to get me fired.\n\nTL;DR: I left the door unlocked in a secure building and the guard tried to get me fired. I made sure during my next visit that I locked every door, every single time I used it, but that meant that the guard spent the whole day running back and forth unlocking doors and escorting me around the building.",

        "text": "Long time lurker, been debating posting this. I tried to keep it short while providing context, tldr at bottom.\n\nFor context, I (27F) work for a small, local security company. We mainly do oil/gas and logging roads. I typically work pipeline security, but I'm between sites at the moment waiting for spring breakup (when the ground starts to thaw and heavy equipment and trucks can't operate because this is swamp land). Before breakup, they've got a 24/7 log haul happening on one of the big logging roads in our area.\n\nNow because of this, traffic going against the log trucks is being restricted by us. I sit down at the far end of the log road and control who can go through the \"wrong way\". This is limited to 3 companies and their subcontractors because their sites are close to my end of the road and they don't interfere with log trucks. Any company that is in violation of this rule receives a $10,000 fine, and their road use privileges are affected. In this case, they can still only travel one way on the road once breakup hits and the log haul has to stop, until the logging company says otherwise.\n\nOne company in particular has been one massive pain this whole time. Let's call them S, for privacy reasons. Now S site sits about halfway down the log road. They have to go down to the far end of the road and drive the same direction as the log trucks. Well they don't bother telling their subcontractors this, so all day every day I'm busy turning these guys away.\n\nOne morning last week, this big pickup pulls up, and I ask the usual of \"where you headed?\" He gave me the kilometre number of where the site is. Its S company. Only he gives me a different company name, a subcontractor. We'll call that company P. I informed the guy that he couldn't go this way. And he lost it.\n\nStarts cursing and swearing, yelling about how it's complete bullshit and I shouldn't be allowed to do this. He tells me he's gone this way down the road plenty of times when he's not working, and it's never been an issue. \n\nThe thing is that private users, so just regular people, are technically allowed. Legally speaking we can't stop them, as roads are public to a degree. There's a whole thing that I'm not gunna get into. Private users are allowed to use the road, though we strongly caution against it.\n\n\"Alright then I'm a private user and you can't stop me!\"\n\"You just told me that you're here for work, but alright, if you say so. You've been warned!\" And he floors it on down the road.\n\nWhat followed was a 4 day manhunt. I immediately notified the road patrol supervisor, as well as road patrol, and my boss. I was asked questions for 4 days while they tried to identify this guy. Because he said he was going to work for S company, they got hit with the fine. Of course this didn't go over well with them either. Next thing I know, the site superintendent is asking me tons of questions about the guy. When I said he worked for company P, well that didn't go over well. From my understanding, company P was at risk of losing the contract they had with company S over this. Company P then started digging around, and I heard they found out who it was, and the guy lost his job over it.\n\nThe kicker? He wasn't even working for company S that day. The superintendent told me they didn't have company P out working on anything. One of his employees had seen the truck I described way on the other side of S site. He hadn't even stopped there. As far as anyone knows, he actually was there as a private user. And had he just said as much, none of this would have happened.\n\nTL;dr guy chose to piss off security by swearing at me first thing in the morning, cost the company $10,000 and got himself fired.",

        "text": "This is an older story I hope I haven't posted before.\n\n \n\nI was working at Widgets International in their Order Entry department.  Widgets would come in for repair, I would type them up and move them along.  One step in my process required me to flag for Quality Review any repair that had a significant enough complaint.  This is a step I rarely followed.  Why, you may ask?\n\n \n\nIn my first month working there I flagged maybe three orders out of several thousand.  I was told that I was flagging too many.  Turns out that Quality Review screens and pre-flags all the repairs they want to look at before they even come across my desk.  My flagging orders was a waste of time.  My time if the order was already flagged and Quality Review’s time if I flagged an order they’d already determined they didn’t need to see.  So I stopped.\n\n \n\nThen we got a new manager, Portia.  Portia was hot to make her mark on our team so she reviewed our process and decided that we should be more active in flagging orders for Quality Review.  I explained to her what I explained to you in the previous paragraph, that there was no point in our flagging anything.  Portia refused to believe me and insisted we follow the process.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Okay, Boomer.  So we started flagging more orders.\n\n \n\nTwo weeks later, Portia tells us that the Quality Review team has come to her in a panic because of all the orders we were sending to them and could we please stop sending so many.  I go back to not flagging anything and everything goes back to normal.  Portia is happy that she made an impact and Quality Review and I are happy to dispense with the extra work Portia created.\n\n \n\nA couple years later we get a new manager, Shithead Stanley.  Stanley was brought in because the team had recently expanded.  We went through the same song and dance with Stanley that we had gone through with Portia; Stanley wanted us to flag more orders for Quality Review.  The new team members nodded fearfully and went along with it; Stanley was not a pleasant man.  We senior team members rolled our eyes, agreed, and started making bets on how long it would last this time.  I bet a week but continued on my merry way *not*flagging orders.\n\n \n\nA week later (called it!), Stanley tells us that the Quality Review team has come to him in a panic because of all the orders we were sending to them and asked us to stop sending so many.  With the information from the QR team, Stanley singles me out.  He tells my team, “Squid is the only one who isn’t flagging too many orders.  The rest of you should be like Squid.”  No Work is Best Work.",

        "text": "A little back story....I had a friend who worked as a processor for a small mortgage company....small in that they had around 15 offices scattered throughout NC.  She found another job and put in her two week's notice.  The person they hired to replace her quit 2 days before her two weeks were up.  So her office was in a bind!  \n\nIn walks me.  My friend told her boss she knew someone who could do the job, and that, since she was friends with this person, she would be willing to train her after hours and on weekends, plus, if possible, take calls during the week.  That take calls during the week is important!  So I was hired.  \n\nThe manager wasn't too happy about it as I had no actual experience in an office setting, just college knowledge, but as long as my friend would help me, she said OK.  But because of this, whenever I would ask my boss a question, she would immediately get upset and tell me to call my friend.  Even for simple things, like, where do we keep the stamps?\n\nPlease keep in mind that this was the early 90s, and all our computer systems were DOS based and quite difficult to master. The number one mortgage software, at that time, was a system called Contour, which was pretty non-user friendly for such a costly program.  I was trained that if an issue came up, I was to fix it myself and not to contact Contour.  I was given a list of common errors and how to fix them.\n\n I'm on my 4th day, and an error pops up on the screen that I had never seen before and is not on my list.  It states I am to call this 800 number and speak with a Contour Technician to help clear it.  I immediately call my friend, but she is not available right then as she is going through her own training.  So I go to my boss.  She tells me to call my friend.  I tell her I tried, but she can't talk right now. She gets mad and starts swearing that she knew hiring me was a bad idea.  I asked if there was anyone else I could call, and she said, \"Just call IT.\"  I reiterated to her I was told not to call Contour.  She says call IT! So I did.\n\nThe Contour Technician was a sweetheart and walked me through how to fix the problem.  To help in the future, the technician asked me to print a diagnostic page and fax it to him so he could see if there were any other problems being as I was new to the system.  So I did.  He thanked me and told me he didn't see any other issues but to call him if I had any more problems.\n\nCue the next day... my boss called me into her office and was livid!  According to her, I just caused the company to have to pay 30k in licensing fees.  It appeared the company had only bought 4 copies of the Contour program, but had installed it in way over four computers.  My faxing the diagnostic page let the cat out of the bag.  But since she told me to call IT, and the fact that firing me for exposing the company doing something illegal would also be illegal, all she could do was rage at me.  She then called my friend and raged at her.  From then on out, I refused to call my friend if I had any questions and just bugged my boss.  \n\nShe never did fire me, and towards the end, we became, if not friends, not enemies, until the company closed under mysterious circumstances a few years later.",

        "text": "First I'd like to apologize for any grammar mistake as i'm not a native english speaker, also as there is a lot of things i need to mention to put into context this might be a little longer than usual, so bear with me for a while, if not TL:DR at the bottom\n\nI (31M) started working for my uncle two years ago, he has a company with some business partners of his, my work is now being directly under him, learning every perk of running the business and also being a personal assistant to him.\n\nWe settled on a contract in which I'd recieve a fixed montly amount with a bonus of an aditional salary by the end of every year, and while I had no overtime pay, I had total control of my work schedule, and by total I meant TOTAL, where I could come to the job just 3 days a week as long as I delivered results.\n\nMy uncle knew my work ethic so is kinda of a win for him since when needed i'd work 60-65 hours a week, if needed to, also I could work during a holiday (we have around 10-12 festivities days that are non working days - if i were to put into an American perspective, is just as if we had over 10 july 4th holidays during the year), also I was avaliable on call nearly 24/7 if anyone needed anything from me related to work.\n\nWork was running great until september last year when my uncle took a couple days to travel to another state to meet new clients and one of his associates (let's call him Gordon) took his role in the company for a those days to suport some of his roles. \n\ndue to having worked a 14 hour shift the day before the travel, and also having 2 12 hour shifts the week before I was dead tired, and since we had little to no work piled up i took a early leave the first day he was there and arrived way after lunch the day after, then started working normaly from the 3rd day until he came back a week later.\n\nhe was furious at my \"attitude\" berating my uncle for even contracting me in the first place, since i don't even work full regular hours and demand among the other business partners (the company has in total 6 owners including my uncle), that I at least punch in my working hours and if i don't meet the \"quota\", those would be deducted from my monthly payment.\n\nthere's a ton of labor laws were i live, employees have a certain amont of hours required to work each month, every hour short of that is deducted from the monthly payment, and every hour beyond is payed as overtime.\n\nother partners backed up Gordon's Claim stating that I needed more supervision on what I was doing, which my uncle was forced to comply, his only remark was \"since we're doing by law, it means that we also will pay him overtime acording to the law, right?\" - they all agreed and from October foward I would start punching my hours on the job everyday.\n\ncue the malicious compliance, that was exactly what i did, Gordon was expecting a decrease on my pay due to being in the company at my least busy week since I arrived, when in fact i usually pull a crapload of overtime, also, if they need to call me after I left they have to punch in the hours from the moment I left until the I finish the call, resulting in \"free\" overtime pay.\n\nOne more thing, by the law the rate of overtime pay increases the more overtime is done in a month, is a really weird formula, but to simplify my average overtime hours pays 1/3 higher than the average overtime hours of other employees that have the same monthly salary as me.\n\nMy monthly income is now 30% higher due to the overtime I started recieving and in a busy month that could get even close to 50% higher even though I am actually working a little less than before and Gordon can't go back in the same situation as before, since my uncle made sure that once i started punching my hours there was no going back, and all partners aproved\n\nTL:DR boss made me punch in my work hours trying to deduce my salary when in fact I do a lot of overtime now my salary got a 30% raise due to the overtime pay",

        "text": " Hi all! This is one of my first ever posts on Reddit, so thanks for bearing with me.\n\nA little background. I work in the film/tv industry. At the time of this story I was working an entry level position called production assistant (PA for short) on a failing tv show. My duties included office upkeep, stocking the kitchen, research for coworkers, various paperwork, picking up supplies from vendors, and picking up lunch for everyone in the department (among a long list of other tasks).\n\nNow I really liked my immediate boss, Coordinator #1. The two of us had a system to keep the office running; and were starting to become friends. The problem? Our Department Head was a sexist and racist ass. At the height of the #MeToo movement I might add. After one too many demeaning “darlings”, winks, sneaking his girlfriend into the office, and flipping through Tinder on company time, Coordinator #1 reported him to the higher-ups. But in typical Hollywood fashion they gave him a gentle slap on the wrist and sent him back to the department. So, Coordinator #1 left the show in disgust.\n\nEnter Coordinator #2. I knew #2 and I wouldn’t get along immediately. She had been fired from her previous tv show for “attitude problems”. On her first day she chewed me out for, I shit you not, hanging the actor photos 11 inches too low on the wall. It only got worse from there. This woman sucked up to the Creepy Dept Head, found faults with everyone around her, and loved power trips. She quickly made herself a nuisance to everyone in the department. But Creepy Dept Head was too busy with Tinder to do anything. \n\nBetween her constant berating, treating me like I was stupid, and unprofessional rudeness, she made my life a living hell. The final straw came when she screamed at me in front of the entire department for a small mistake. I almost packed my bag and walked out right there. In hindsight I should have. But she told me I’d be replaced at the end of the month, so I thought I’d hang in there and collect a paycheck while I could. From then on, I counted down the days, and made no attempt to hide my misery.\n\nThe thing is, the tv show had barely started filming and we were already severely behind schedule. The poor construction department was building sets 24/7, and the first episode was supposed to air in the next few weeks. For everyone in our department this meant extremely long hours and working 6 days a week. Not my problem. I was leaving soon. #2 reminded me on the last week. “Friday is your last day.” \n\nIt ended up being a hell of a week. More long hours and running behind schedule.  The department would need to work another Saturday. Well, Friday came, and I gleefully counted down the hours. At the end of the day #2 realized her mistake. She hustled over to me on my way out the door. “Can you work Saturday?” Cue malicious compliance.\n\n“Nope. You said Friday is my last day.”\n\nThat’s when she got huffy. “I’m trying to get you some extra money.”\n\nGiving up one day of my measly PA paycheck was well worth the look on her face when I said, “No thanks. Friday is my last day. Bye!” and walked out to happily never see her again. I took a job on a much better tv show a few weeks later with the nicest crew. To this day I’ve worked on lots of other shows; and I always warn my coworkers not to ever work with her. Turns out she has quite the bad reputation around town even without my help.\n\nThe fallout after I left: Now that there was no PA working Saturday, #2 had no choice but to do both her job and mine. Years later I’m now a coordinator. And I can tell you it’s a job that keeps you BUSY. There’s no way I’d be able to get anything done without the help of my amazing PAs. So it gives me extreme satisfaction to know she had to get off her high horse, halt her Very Important Emails™, and go get everyone lunch and snackies until my replacement was found.",

She nagged at me in front of the whole office for needing to be called 5 times and being so unresponsive. Then, right there and then she angrily announced to everyone that nobody is allowed to use their headset anymore. She even strutted to the IT room to tell the IT guys to quit using their headsets as well.\n\nBeing the obedient assistant that I am, I took off my headset then connected my computer to the speaker. Then listened to recording at full volume of voices of everyone in the office debating and talking about the audit. The worse, I was not just listening to the conversations in the meeting, sometimes I would stop then replay certain parts of the recording at least five times to capture what was being sent. Everyone in my immediate vicinity just could not stop snickering. Some of the teams across the office who had no idea what happened asked what was going on annoyed that they cant focus at work. Some people are cringed bybtheir voices. I just told them it is a new policy and they just have to live with it. My boss on the other hand pretended she wasnt hearing anything. \n\nI did this for a few days, until it got old and I finally returned to using my headset.",

        "text": "Context: my friends and I house-shared with the worst people ever (a couple). They were loud, messy, gross, they shouted and swore all day and night, they took priority over all communal spaces and made it seem like we weren’t welcome in our own home. They also stole from us constantly. \n\nHere’s the kicker, despite all that, they were very very strict on house rules (for us obviously, not them). We would get screamed at if we made any noise whilst they were sleeping. But they could stomp around the house, shouting and swearing, slamming all the doors at 3am as much as they like. \n\nObviously the house wasn’t this clean, crisp, haven of peace. It was an 8 person student house, so you can expect a bit of noise and mess. We tried explaining to them that if they can leave their dishes to rot and mould in the kitchen, we could maybe get a bit more slack with what we were allowed to do. (If we left a cup next to the sink over night they would break it). They would try to paint this picture of us being these horrible messy and inconsiderate housemates (we were literally too scared to leave our rooms and lived off takeaway for months so we didn’t make any mess). \n\nWe did everything, the cleaning of the whole house, the bins, cleaning up their mess. Etc. as mentioned above, we stayed in our rooms and would go to each others rooms and didn’t cook in the kitchen or go downstairs for anything. So when we stopped cleaning the downstairs ( we were never down there so no mess was ours) it started to get messy from their own doing. Empty drink bottles everywhere, cushions thrown around, rubbish all over the floor. \n\nOne of them decides to tidy their own mess! Before they both left for a few days. \n\nWe were finally able to relax and chill downstairs, we didn’t feel anxious anymore, we went out (they didn’t let us leave the house without them). All brilliant and good. Until we get a text message. “Can we make-sure to keep the house tidy as I’ve just cleaned all of downstairs as it was soo messy! :)”. \n\nThis text changed something in me. Idk if it was the acting like cleaning up your own mess is this amazing favour. Or acting like it wasn’t her and her bfs mess she cleaned up, and us disgusting little rats would mess up her beautiful cleaning job instantly. \n\nSo I decided to clean. I picked up everything in the living room and kitchen thT belonged to them and put it in nice big pile, over their personal hob. (They were only allowed to use the fancy hob).when I say everything, I mean everything. Bits of their rubbish, their mouldy mugs and plates that had insects on them. The man had a whole counter top dedicated to empty spice containers (I wasnt allowed my cup with my cutlery in it on the counter). \n\nWhen they found the pile, they asked me why I didn’t throw out the rubbish. I said something along the lines of “you said you cleaned these rooms so I assumed you wanted to keep the mouldy wrappers since they’ve been here weeks”. I honestly just wanted to show them that they also make mess too, a lot more than anyone else here, also that her “impeccable cleaning” missed a few spots.",

        "text": "The following recollection happened a few years ago but I have only recently realised that it was in fact a malicious compliance on my part. A late realisation, which is slightly embarrassing given the fact that I've been a long time fan and reader of this subreddit. Nevertheless, I finally have a story to share myself.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nI had to change schools in between the last two years of highschool. Both schools had the same overall educational system and both were obsessed with not letting anyone get away with plagiarism and so viewed Turnitin as the teacher's best friend. For those who are not familiar, it's basically a platform that checks for plagiarism any piece of written work you upload into it. The thing about it was though that it would check a newly uploaded piece against the other pieces of work that had been uploaded prior. At least that's what my understanding of it was over a decade ago (time zooms; madness). \n\nAnyway, as I said, these two schools had the same educational programme. I was even able to take the exact same classes at the same level for some subjects once I've moved over. One of them was Chemistry. The only difference between the two schools' programmes was that the coursework in the first school had to be done in the first year, whilst the coursework in the second school had to be completed in the second year. And since I moved in-between the two years, I was essentially coming into the second school with all of my required coursework completed, submitted, done and dusted like jello mustard, and most importantly 'turnitin'-ed. \n\nThis one particular coursework which caused the MC I am about to share, was in a way a unique piece of work. I did a small experiment, based on a suggestion from my professor, testing the relation between the rate of heating of a liquid in a glass container and the surface area of an exposed spirit burner's wick. The experiment turned out to be something that had little to none information online. So I ended up writing most of my coursework just purely based on my findings (FYI: the smaller the wick the faster the rate of heating, which was the complete opposite of my initial hypothesis). So once I've completed it and turned it in and got it checked for plagiarism, unsurprisingly, I had almost 0% plagiarism. \n\nFast -forward about a year - I'm back in Chemistry in my second year of my new highschool. My new professor (who was a chill lady but unwavering about rules) was aware of my educational background and the current situation with my coursework as by then, she had already gone through my file and checked the grades and feedback I received for all of my projects the year prior. When the time came for the coursework in this second school, even though my new professor agreed that I don't need to work on any new coursework, she still insisted that I submit my old coursework into Turnitin. I tried to explain to her that based on my understanding, if I were to upload the coursework in question to Turnitin, it will most certainly get flagged for plagiarism (one of the deadly sins as viewed by both schools; which is fair enough, no likes their efforts to be claimed by someone else). My new professor would not have any of it, and kept on insisting that no matter what I say I absolutely have to upload it. And so I complied (maliciously as I now realise). \n\nA day goes by and I'm sitting in a different class going about my day when an administrator assistant comes in, with a serious look of concern on their face, and asks that I go to the principal's office immediately. As you'd imagine all of my classmates had the expected facial expression of that Chris Pratt 'oh snap' gif meme.\n\nSo I proceed to go visit the principal's office - there I find the principal, my Chemistry professor, and if I remember correctly, the ethics counsellor, all with grim expression, sitting in a semi circle around a monitor. They ask me to sit down and start the conversation by explaining how bad plagiarism is exactly and how they have never seen such a high percentage of plagiarism at any point in the history of this school for any piece of work tuned in before - if my memory doesn't fail me, my coursework showed 86% plagiarism. At first I was taken aback and had a momentary surge of panic, thinking \"oh damn this is serious, what's happening?!\". But once I heard the percentage of plagiarism I figured that it was the damn spirit burner project.\n\nThe principal asked me to explain myself so I asked whether it shows the origin of the work that the website thinks I had plagiarised from. They said yes and turned the monitor to face me - lo and behold, in, admittedly, fine print the name and the author of the original piece of work is highlighted stating my full name. As I point that out, all three have the \"What?\" reaction and check for themselves. After realising their oversight, my chemistry teacher finally admits that she now got what I was trying to tell her before.\n\nWith a sigh of relief and a bit of a nervous chuckle, from both my side and the side of the administration, I was let go with an apology for raising the alarms. So I just went back to class with my nose up high and feeling unreasonably victorious and vindicated, as if I beat some kind of totalitarian system that punishes the creative minds of the youth.\n\nAnyway, that was it! \n\nTL;DR: I was made to submit a unique piece of coursework into a plagiarism checking software even though I said that it would be flagged for plagiarism because I've already submitted this piece of coursework into this plagiarism checking software and it was expectedly and massively flagged for plagiarism, so I almost got into big trouble",

Young lady preparing all the paperwork to submit the loan application to the bank.  We were told she was the best.  Never had a loan turned down.  We were to do as she said.  \n\nWe submitted pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, employment history, etc., etc, and tried to dot all the Is and cross all the Ts.  When we thought we were all done, she explained that we needed one more thing.  I needed to write a letter explaining a gap in my employment.  \n\nWhat? A gap?  What gap?  \n\nWell, it turns out that I had indicated in one of the forms I submitted that my last day of one job was a Friday, and my first day of the new job did not begin until the following Monday.  I politely indicated that was nuts, there wasn't a gap, that was a weekend, which is a pretty normal thing.  She insisted however, that she was the GOAT (or the 1980s equivalent of the GOAT), and that we knew nothing about the process and she would not be denied if we wanted our loan.   \n\nAnnoyed, I complied.  I wrote a letter explaining the gap in my employment.  To whom it may concern, about that gap in employment from Friday to Monday, I was engaged in running guns for the Nicaraguan rebels the entire weekend (running guns for the Nicaraguan rebels was kind of a thing at the time).    \n\nSigned it and submitted it.  Don't know if she ever read it or not, or even included it in the loan application package.  We got the loan.  Her record remained perfect.",

        "text": "Being a travel nurse in the operating room has its benefits; the pay, the ability to take time off between assignments, and the bits of malicious compliance that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.\n\n\nBeen at this hospital for two months. I’ve worked with this particular surgeon a handful of times, but it’s always been the same procedure so I know what he wants for every step of the case. I’m about to start applying skin prep (another layer of antimicrobial security to prevent postop infection) to where the surgeon is going to operate; he always wants the armpit, front shoulder, and breast/chest of the specific side prepped.\n\n\nWe’re operating on the patient’s right side. They’re already asleep, and their right arm is padded and secured on an arm board. Before I start prepping, the scrub tech immediately says “You need to undo their arm [from the board] so that you can prep the whole arm.” I tell them no, the surgeon wants it prepped this way, the arm stays on the board. This scrub tech hadn’t done this case with this doctor in quite some time either, but they still decided to explain how the whole arm should be prepped for this procedure. I ignored them.\n\n\nI begin my prep. Less than a minute later, the charge nurse comes in to log in to a portable X-ray device (us travelers don’t often get credentials for those), and the scrub tech decides to ask the charge nurse how the surgical site should be prepped for this case, right in front of me. The charge nurse backs up the scrub tech and tells me I should be prepping the whole arm in addition to the sites that I mentioned earlier. I protested, “But Dr. X doesn’t want that, he always wants the same areas prepped and draped accordingly.” The charge nurse wasn’t budging, and they demand I unfasten the arm and do it their way instead.\n\n\nI sigh, and say okay. Cue MC. I prep the whole arm and am holding it in my sterile glove while waiting for the drapes and stockinette to be applied. All of a sudden, the most glorious thing happens: the surgeon arrives with the charge nurse still in the room.\n\n\n“Did you prep the WHOLE ARM?!” he asked me. \n“Yep!”\n“Why did you do that? You’ve been here two months, how do you not remember the prep by now?!”\n“I was told to prep it this way.”\n“By who?! Who told you to do it this way??”\n\n\nThe surgeon was pissed due to this delay; as a traveler I’ve learned to take the heat for making small mistakes, and I was contemplating taking the fall for this so that we could just move on with the rest of the day. But before I could speak, my charge nurse was actually humble and admitted that they told me to prep the whole arm. The doc looked at me. “Did you tell them how I prefer it to be done?”\n“I did.”\n\n\nThe doc turned back to the charge nurse and proceeded to lambast her for delaying the case. The scrub tech just stared blankly at the wall. But I didn’t look or listen, I just stood there enjoying the moment with the biggest shit-eating grin under my mask. It’s a nice day when someone else proves you were right.\n\n\nNeedless to say, I didn’t renew my contract at that hospital.",

        "text": "So reading some of these reminds me of my time in a plastic manufacturing plant and how I was told I didn't understand business. We had bought a machine brand new for $750,000 us dollars and it was making us a fair amount of money. My bosses didn't want to do the regular maintenance on it though so as expected it began having issues. I was running the machine one night and noticed it began leaking either oil or hydraulic fluid, can't remember which. I immediately told my boss we needed to shut it down because not only was the machine getting worse but it was starting to spray fluid all over the parts. I was told no, this machine had to run or we would lose $500 an hour. I suggested placing the mold in another machine but I was told no, and further told I didn't understand business. \n\nWell as expected it had more problems which I reported but was told they might take the parts despite being covered in the fluid, and not to worry about the machine now spraying fluid like a bad horror film sprays blood. I asked if he was sure they wanted it to keep running they looked at me and firmly said yes, so I did.\n\nEventually the grinding sounds hit and the machine shut down. They freaked out a moment trying to fix it but it was no good. They moved the mold into a different machine, had to rerun all the parts, and remember that $500 an hour they lost for the machine being down? Well instead of being down 24 to 36 hours costing them about $18,000 the machine was down 3 weeks costing in production $252,000 plus another $45,000 for a new motor. Clearly losing almost $300,000 makes way more sense than $18,000. They're right I don't understand that kind of business.",

        "text": "So I'm gonna tell my story too. I'm on PC but not a native speaker, so I apologise for grammar.\n\nI work for a subsidiary of a fortune 500 as a manager of a dev team. I have 7 people under me, think L3 people very knowledgeable and driven to solve issues. We're all remote. I'm lucky my team is mostly great and we achieve the objectives we are given.\n\nOne day, the new security manager decides that devs are not allowed to be administrators of their laptops. He writes a new company policy for it. It's a shit show for us. It means my team can't work on some applications that requires administrative rights. Also, as devs know, some bugs need my guys to install/ desinstall/ reinstall the applications many times to make it work, changing only a few parameters each time. So I try to push back saying it might impact our service level agreements but the security manager doesn't want to understand and just sends me emails with \"NO\" in bold and caps. His boss is AFK for health reasons so I can't escalate as I would have.\n\nThe only way to make my guys work is that we need someone with the admin rights to unlock them when they need it. That admin is part of the support center. So, cue malicious compliance, I ask my team to create a ticket each time. They're not happy about it of course. The support center manager isn't happy either, because we create a lot of tickets and his team has been understaffed for a while. I also tell all the other managers in my department to do the same, and even though they create a lot less tickets than my team, it helps. \n\nOf course this is my plan. If my team is unhappy, other people in the company are going to be too.\n\nSo pressure piles up. The support center manager is unhappy, his boss saw the numbers increases too so he's unhappy too. He talks to my boss but hey, I have emails from the security manager.\n\nThe support center manager asks me to be reasonable and asks for a number of hours per week. I'm a team player of course, so yes, I want to help him. I ask for 20h/week for a guy from his team to sit around waiting for my team to need him, unlock their install and then wait some more. I'm guessing the admin is pretty happy about it, because it's way less pressure than his normal job and there's not much to do but type in an admin password once in a while.\n\nThen comes the climax, one application has a critical bug outside of the hours of the support center guy. So I tell them as per my agreement with the support center manager and obeying the security manager, my team can't work on it yet, we'll have to wait the next day. It's a healthcare product so it means a lot of our customers are going to be upset about it (can't say too much, don't want to be found).\n\nOf course, I'm a reasonable guy, the support center manager is too, so we find someone with admin rights and put my guys to work. The resolution of the ticket takes much longer than usual to solve because of all the back &amp; forth between the admin and my team. During the postmortem, it is found than the new security policy was the main delaying cause (every member of my team told the postmortem woman that, as I did). I have all the emails I sent to the security manager highlighting the risks of this new policy, and him saying he didn't care for it. I sent that to the postmortem woman and let her find her way in the politics.\n\n3 months later, the security manager doesn't work for us anymore, and most members of my team (but not all :( ) have admin rights on their machine. I learnt that the support center manager has made his mission in life to complain about the security manager to everyone who would listen and have him fired. And the support center manager knows a lot of people in the company. His director agreed with him and with the postmortem woman (or her boss, not sure at that point), they convinced the VP to fire the security manager even before the security director came back from his health issue.\n\nTL;DR : a new security manager tries to make new rules that don't work, problems follow, he gets fired.",

        "text": "Going to try to be vague as I do still work there. So, this happened many, many years ago and the main character is actually someone else. But, most of the staff knew the details of what happened. So, first some background. This company has a production process, and there are cycles of this process throughout the shift. At the end of each cycle, you do an \"upload\" (not the actual thing). This upload has to be coordinated across multiple work teams, and the person who does it has plenty of other duties, but this is one of the most important ones. Let's call this person's job title \"upload operator\" or UO for short. If this isn't done correctly, it can really slow down or even stop production. So the UO is typically pretty tenured and on the trajectory of being promoted.\n\nAt this company, when we get new members of management either external or internal from a non-production role, it is not unusual for them to go through a phase I personally like to refer to as \"knowing just enough to be dangerous\" or \"dangerous phase\" for short. We had a new manager join the company, let's call them NM for new manager. And they were assigned to night shift, which had become quite reliant on the UO in the interim. So NM went through a humble phase initially, and everyone really liked them and thought they would do well. Now NM had actually take a step or two down from their previous role at another company wanting to do something less stressful. I only mention this because it seemed to fuel the hubris that was ultimately NM's demise. So, once NM reaches the dangerous phase, the change from humble newby to overconfident jackwagon was jarringly sudden. One evening, UO is doing what they do, and one work team was struggling to be ready for the upload. Now, this happens sometimes, but it's one of the only teams that doesn't necessarily stop production if they don't upload on time. Nevertheless, NM freaks out on UO for uploading without them and as UO is trying to explain that we had to upload, NM tells them that they \"don't upload until NM tells them to upload, period, end of discussion, do you understand me?\" Cue malicious compliance.\n\nThe rest of the shift, NM is paying zero attention to the operation. Not sure why they thought that was a good idea after such a contentious exchange, but here we are. All night long, team leads were calling UO asking what was going on and why we hadn't uploaded so we could go on to the next cycle. UO just kept saying, \"I'm waiting for NM to let me know we can upload.\" And all night long, NM was blissfully unaware of the shit storm he had initiated. Towards the end of the night, NM finally decides to take a look at some operational \"dashboards\" and realizes something is really wrong. Now, this situation might have resulted in UO getting in trouble, possibly even losing their job, if not for the bonehead decision that NM makes once they've realized what has happened. They shut down the shift and went home, without notifying anyone of the debacle or telling the night shift employees that they would need to come in the next day to finish the week's work that didn't get done because of him. When the day shift came in and were told they would have to come in on a weekend, there was a lot of backlash. UO was ultimately told don't ever do that again, but was also immediately promoted to NM's position when NM was terminated post haste.",

        "text": "My friend(Jemma) tells me about how she and an entire group of Bridesmaids left a wedding after their friend dared them to.\n\nSo this all happened  a few weeks ago, a long time friend of jemma's group was getting married in another state but the day of the wedding she suddenly had a problem with one girl who wore glasses, which she didn't have an issue with beforehand; the glasses girl told her she wouldn't wear them during the vows and pictures but the bridezilla didn't want her wearing them at all and was screaming at her to not put them on for the rest of the day, obviously she couldn't do that since she needs to see.\n\nThe argument got more heated until bridezilla gave her the ultimatum to take them off &amp; keep em off or leave. This is when jemma and the other bridesmaids stepped in, told bridezilla she was out of line, and that they would all leave if she forced the girl with glasses to leave; Bridezilla called their bluff and, being maids of their word, the bridesmaids left the wedding and decided to celebrate and eat at a restaurant before they head back home. Bridezilla called them several times after they left, telling them that she didn't care about the glasses anymore and begged them to come back to the venue, but they not only refused but also chose to end the friendship, with her, all together. Jemma said that the wedding proceeded as follows, just minus the bridesmaids and a few awkward stares because everyone heard the bridezilla's screaming from earlier.\n\nJemma told me that the bridezilla has always been like this, throwing a tantrum when she doesn't get her way, and that the meltdown at the wedding was just the last straw for them. Personally, i think she's got a monk's patience if she put up with her for that long.",

        "text": "Background - Always been somewhat a workaholic, being an insomniac leaves me alot of night time to fill... Can't keep my wife and kids up, so I've filled the time with work related stuff (gaming only goes so far) \n\nCorp finance IT job few years back, some history before the \"fall\" - I started out as a subbie, then upgraded to consultant and then to permanent. My work ethic seemed to be what they wanted... The perks drove the choice for permanent positon (medical, pension, etc). When I became permanent, work became interesting. Firstly, I had to do time sheets in an admin position. Because of traffic I drove in early, 6:30am and left at 6pm (even though working hours were 8-5),logged my time sheet when I arrived and when I left, but only measure 8.5 hours because the choice was mine to work extra. Didn't mind because I missed 4 hours traffic daily. I had a pc to work on, but after a couple weeks I asked to get a laptop, so I could work at home as well. No, not work FROM home, just get some work done that I couldn't with time limitations at the office (always done it, it gives me time to improve on what and how I do things. I. E. Automate stuff with scripts, prebuilt spreadsheets etc). Add to this, I smoke (it'll be clearer soon 😂). I took an allotted 5 smoke breaks a day (same as coffee drinkers I spose?), but I personally reduced my lunch hour to 30 mins to cover the extra \"time lost\" going up and down 7 flights of escalators. \n\nNow to the fun side of things - 3 months into permanent position, I get called into HR to be told I can't work 10 hours+ a day and only log 8.5.i MUST record actual time spent. The catch was my boss didn't pay overtime... The laptop request was denied as \"it was to expensive\" (consider it cost an extra 9USD a month to use a laptop rental instead of a pc...?), plus I MUST take 1 hour lunch.\n\nSo, I complied - I still drove in and left the same times I did before, but now I only went to my desk at 8 and clocked out at 4:30,no matter what was left to do. I still took my allotted 5 smokes a day, but I made sure I used my 1 hour lunch to the max. Oh, and 6 months into the job, they demanded I take a laptop. You csn guess how my \"polite denial\" went down...\n\nAnyway, I stayed at the hob another 18 months (needed the money), but there was alot more \"compliance\" scenarios that went down... Not to their benefit... 😂",

        "text": "So this is a fun little story from my last job working in a vegetarian/vegan food factory. It was the worst job you can imagine, the place smelled like rotting food at all times, the employees rarely ever do anything to prevent spreading illnesses (they would regularly show up sick even during Covid) and management was just the worst. I quickly adopted the policy of doing the least irritating job I could find and trying to avoid listening to my shift lead since he was a prick. For the sake of the story lets call the shift lead \"Jim\", \"Jim\" was a by the numbers guy, to the point that if you argued with him using logic he would instead tell you your wrong and \"his math\" (yes he would point that phrasing out very deliberately) was what they were going to use and to \"not think above your pay rate\". \n\nSo on this particular night (I worked from 7pm to 5am) Jim decided he wanted to be really lazy since the building owner was going to be gone for the week and he wouldn't have to report anything to him for days, he spent his whole night just sitting in the office playing games on his phone ignoring our calls because we needed assistance. After about 8-9pm rolled around and me finally getting pissed off enough to care I ask my department manager if he could cover me for a couple of minutes to get Jim in there to help (we needed him to go get maintenance because the machine sealing a product called Tempeh was barely sealing any at all and we where throwing away about 70-80% of all packages). I get into his office and before I can say a single word Jim says very loudly \"Whatever it is I don't care, just leave me alone tonight!\" I tried to get in a word but he just glared at me and said \"Just get the fuck out and don't bother me again!\" Then a evil thought crossed my mind.\n\nQueue the malicious compliance, \"You want just me to not bother you Jim? Or does that mean everyone?\" I asked and he says the words that screwed him over \"As long as I'm not bothered I don't care!\" Alright I say and leave with a grin that most anime villains dream of doing, I get to my department manager and tell him that \"Jim doesn't want to be bothered at all tonight\". My manager looks at me kind of confused at first and asked what the hell does that mean to which I just told him \"Jim doesn't care what happens as long as NO ONE bothers him\" me putting a big emphasis on the last part. Now my department manager was the guy you go to for getting information around the build fast, he's a fast talker and quick on his feet. He lets me get back into my spot and very quickly starts darting around to each department to inform them of what transpired. Needless to say Jim wasn't bothered at all the entire night, he even had to be waken up at 3am to do his nightly paperwork because he fell asleep. During the night the machines packaging the soy hotdogs also started sealing poorly but we couldn't get any maintenance out there until its been approved by Jim so we just ran it all night. By the end of the night my line (I worked in the boxing department, boxing up the Tempeh) had thrown away roughly 4 tons of Tempeh, we used large red buggies that would hold at least 500 pounds and we chucked 17 of those suckers, I wont even try to count up the dogs that where thrown out too. Needless to say this was going to hit the company HARD!\n\nNext day my shift comes in and to no ones surprise Jim is on my ass right away \"Why didn't you inform me that we where loosing so much product!\" he starts screaming into my face \"The owner looked at his email and saw that we lost nearly $15,000 in product alone last night!\" I simply smiled at Jim and said to him \"I would of said something but you told me not to bother you all night.\" Jim realizing he could be in trouble for this doubles down on trying to blame me \"You had a duty to tell me even if its against my orders!\" He shouts. I calmly put my helmet on and colored coat, smile and say \"Sorry I didn't think because it was above my pay grade\" and then I went out onto the floor quite happy that I knew he was either going to be in a shit ton of trouble or fired. Sadly he wasn't fired only in trouble, he's position was nearly up for grabs and he had to work every day for 6 months after that (with only Sunday's off) before they eased up on him. Did he learn from this? No, he was still a total prick that the whole staff generally acted nice to but hated with a passion.\n\nThis is just one of a few cases of malicious compliance I have working there and at a retail job I had before, I might post some more stories about those at a later date.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: This didn't happen in the US or UK. / English isn't my first language (but I'm working on it!)\n\nI (M22) work as a teacher at my college's application school. We work little hours and we get paid a small amount of money too. It's like an internship. For the past semesters, I've been dealing with a supervisor whom we'll call \"Sheila\"(F±40).\n\nSheila is one of four supervisors at the school. The supervisors usually drop by your class once in a while to check if the students are having their needs met or to solve any issues (like a student that wants to retake a class, etc).\n \nMy issue was that Sheila has a strange interest in me and, for some reason, focused way too much on what I did at class, to the point of obviously overlooking other teachers. Because Sheila isn't a professor from my department, she only knew about me from colleagues or rumors around college. Such rumors include: I bring whole meals to college instead of eating at the cafeteria like everyone (???), I was supposed to be in another college (why?), I'm not actually from the state (this one is true) and so on. She confronted me about these rumors in front of colleagues but I brushed it off, which seemed to annoy her.\n\nSheila then began to try and find out things I wasn't able to do. She asked me questions about buying a very specific device (imagine something like a wifi camera) which I, of course, wasn't able to answer. She giggled and looked smug after that. I, however, managed to answer her other questions, even if they didn't relate to my field. Which made her slightly upset.\n\nIn one of those semesters, an older student (that is a lawyer) that we'll call Amanda (F±60), started to request some things from me that I wasn't able to nor had permission to give. Such things include: a FREE (school approved) GOOD digital dictionary, extremely detailed and personalized exam AND exercise corrections, detailing of my methodology, explanations of the goals of every lesson and audio transcripts of exam materials.\n\nDue to Amanda's lawyer occupation, she worded those requests to me in a very formal way. Our school is careful with lawyer students due to some legal issues that happened in the past (something like a student trying to fire a teacher because they got caught cheating). \nBecause I wasn't able to fulfill her requests due to lack of permission (and I'm not interested on going to court), I asked her to forward her requests to my superiors. And guess who answered them? Sheila.\n\nSheila didn't even bat an eye to Amanda's requests and started forwarding them to me, saying that I should comply. Because Amanda got what she wanted, she began sending more and more requests, to the point that Sheila just told me to accept all forwarded requests and be fast about it.\n\nSo, I did it. I sent materials, transcripts and the like, all in the name of the school. Amanda was very happy and Sheila was loving the extra work I was doing. She thought she was being smart and had the upper hand.\n\nWell not until Sheila tried to embarrass me in front of my class. She said that despite my \"excellent work\", I'm \"standoffish\", and that's \"funny\". My students tried to correct her statement but she just ignored them by saying \"really?\" and swiftly left. She tried to pull this again at an online class and another group of students shut her down again. I e-mailed her shortly after that saying that I would prefer her observations about my work to be done in a private setting, rather than in front of the whole class.\n\nSheila replied immediately, denying everything and said that I was imagining stuff. She even tried to manipulate me by saying that she was the \"most vocal\" supervisor in \"my favor\" and was \"ceaselessly requesting\" a promotion for me (which I never got). In the end, she assured me that no further comments would be made.\n\nThat's what I foolishly thought.\n\nDuring a meeting, my boss addressed to all of us a \"concern\" from an unnamed supervisor that said us teachers were getting embarrassed by her PRESENCE. My boss said that such behavior was unacceptable and they are there to help. At that moment, I saw red. I couldn't believe Sheila had twisted my words and told my boss about the email exchange portraying me as the bad guy.\n\nAt one point in the meeting, I asked the other supervisors if we teachers were supposed to do everything I was asked to do for Amanda. They all replied a firm \"no\" to and even gasped when I mentioned transcripts. Basically, our school doesn't have the authority to provide transcripts and students could legally contest test results if a mistake was present in the transcription.\n\nI then requested a meeting with my boss and another supervisor about this. In the meeting, I pointed out that they said that we weren't supposed to be doing those tasks but I was being ordered to do them anyway. My supervisor quickly opened the email and discovered that Sheila was \"sniping\" emails from my and my students and exclusively replied to all of them using her personal phone, before others could do or see anything. We also discovered that she was archiving some of the requests so they wouldn't be found easily. I helped them dig everything up and my boss and the other supervisor said it was inappropriate of the supervisor to do that and they would talk with her about this.\n\nI left the meeting feeling relieved and hoped something would be done. After a few weeks, I saw the supervisor in person but she just said \"excuse me\" and quickly left to another room. I kid you not, this woman treats me like I'm the plague now. She avoids me, doesn't address me directly anymore and, best of all, was apparently assigned to another role that doesn't involve supervision of teachers! Even though she hasn't been greatly punished, I bet she'll think twice before making her comments again.",

        "text": "In my country when you start 9th (I think) grade, you have to do 3 days of work for free, for the experience and to expolre more about what diffrent jobs require you to do for your future work life. This happened when I was 15.\n\nI had found out about the official date pretty late cause I had been away from school for a while due to being in hospital, so by the time I found out, most jobs were taken, and I was left with going the desperat path, which was working at a nursery. I called the nursery I was in as younger, and lucky me I was allowed to work there even with such short notice (It was 5 days after I had called in).\n\nNow, something I have to mention is, I am a bisexual trans man. Most people in my country are really accepting, even a lot of the elders, but it's of course not all perfect, and there is still much discrimination and homophobia, which I also have experienced first hand. One of the women who works at the nursery is really homophobic, and I was placed in the same group as her with the kids aged 4-5. And no, i wasn't ectivly telling the staff about my gender identity and sexuality, I had a trand and bi pin on my pants which i had forgot to remove before I came in, and before i get asked, I wore the same pants the day before at school cause I was too lazy to change before i left, and I was also running late.\n\nThe 1st day, \"Dina\" (homophobic worker) made it clear she did not like the fact I wasn't cishet. She would deathglare me when a child asked what was on my pants, and when I replied that it was a pin telling people I was a boy, just so people don't forget, she would comment on my stutter while I was reading to the kids (I struggle reading, and sometimes I will start saying a word before my braind had properly made the whole thing out), she almost tripped me twice when i was playing tag with some kids outside, and \"accidentaly\" walked into my waterbottle that I hadnt closed cause a kid needed help trying her shoe, and all this on day one. by the end of the day, I was fed up, so I decided to take it up with the manager, who told me to come back if anything else happend.\n\nThe next day, a kid asked me if I could help him with his sweater. When I was about to help him get it off, Dina pushed me away, and started helping him instead. After the kid left I asked what her issue was, and why she pushed me, which she replied with \"I don't want the kids to end up sinners and having to go to hell because you're teaching them being \\*insert homophobic and transphobic slur\\* is ok\" that got me really offguard. So right thab, my dyslexic brain decided to do exactly what she wanted.\n\nLast day comes, and I come in and I do everything I would, except help out the kids, and I had to tell them they had to ask Dina, cause I was busy with helping someone else with art (which wasnt a lie btw). More, and more kids started coming asking for help with stuff that ment I had to touch them, and I declined everytime, and told them I was busy, and they would have to ask Dina. \n\nBy the end of the day, Dina was pissed I had told all the kids to ask for her to do everything. I just told her I did as she said, and I hadn't touched the kids.\n\nA week ago I returned to the nursery cause I was picking up my cousin that had recently moved here and started going to that nursery, and I talked to a woman that aslo was in the room, but had other tasks that required her to be occupied most the time and wasn't able to help, but she had been watching everything while I was there. Apparently, Dina had been fired. i wasn't the only person she was homophobic to. She had been telling a girl her mommies wouldn't go to heaven cause they were 2 married women. It had been going on for a while, and after I left, the moms had found out and reported it, and at the same time the other woman decided to tell about what Dina said and did to me, which when you added the other write-up Dina had, gave the manager permission to fire her. I WISH I could've seen everything go down.",

We were nice and showed up mid afternoon when it was slow. The cashier said she had to get the manager who explained we couldn't just do a mass order. \n\nSince the entire company was there, we suggested that we would just cycle the line and answer the skill testing question.  The look of horror on the manager's face was priceless. So in a very reasonable compromise that avoided our malicious compliance, the manager filled the entire order and got us to agree that if we were ever to do that again we should call ahead first and they'd work something out.  He did thank us for not showing up at noon. \n\nOur team had mixed reactions (some of them were up for the MC in a big way). But all and all everyone won and only the threat of MC was there.

        "text": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI just wanted to share my story about how I quit my job as a cinema manager with a little bit of malicious compliance.\n\nI had been working at the cinema for a few years, and had worked my way up to be a manager. However, the job was incredibly stressful and demanding, with long hours and constantly changing schedules. On top of that, my boss was very difficult to work with and often made unreasonable demands.\n\nOne day, I had had enough. My boss had asked me to work a double shift, even though I had already worked six days that week. I politely declined, explaining that I needed some time off to rest and recharge.\n\nMy boss didn't take kindly to this and started berating me in front of other employees. That's when I decided to take action.\n\nI calmly walked over to the computer and started typing up my resignation letter. My boss asked what I was doing, and I simply replied, \"I'm quitting.\"\n\nMy boss was taken aback, and started trying to convince me to stay. But I had already made up my mind. I handed him my resignation letter, which included a list of all the reasons why I was quitting, including his unreasonable demands and lack of respect for his employees.\n\nBut here's where the malicious compliance comes in. My boss had always been very particular about how things were done at the cinema, and had a long list of rules and regulations that we had to follow. So, I made sure to follow every single one of those rules in my final days at the cinema.\n\nI arrived at work exactly on time, took my full lunch break, and left exactly on time. I followed every single protocol and procedure, no matter how tedious or unnecessary.\n\nMy boss was clearly annoyed by this, but I didn't care. I was done with the job and I wasn't going to give him any more reason to be difficult.\n\nIn the end, I left the cinema with my head held high, knowing that I had stood up for myself and refused to be treated poorly. It wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "Many years ago I worked at a place with lots of arcade games and pizza; similar to Chuck-E-Cheese.  I was hired to do maintenance, repair, and setup of these arcade machines.  There was already someone there doing this, but they were never allowed to work more than 40 hours a week and the place was open 7 days a week, 9 hours a day (63 hours a week not including prep for opening and cleanup after closing).  At the end of my first shift I was told that I was also expected to help with cleanup since everyone that worked close had to help with cleanup.  All my shifts were close shifts.  This meant I had less time before my morning classes than I expected when taking the job but a few extra bucks was valuable to a starving college student.\n\nFast forward about 2 months.  New manager (fresh out of high school) gets his big boy boots on and starts making rules.\n\nFirst rule: A schedule with everyone's hours for the next week will be posted by Friday morning.\n\nSecond rule: You must clock in before your posted shift start time, but not more than 5 minutes before your shift.\n\nThird rule: You must clock out at the end of your posted shift end time, no more than 5 minutes after.\n\nAt the end of my first shift after these rules were created I clocked out and left everyone else to do the cleanup.  To be clear it's not like I was getting time and a half overtime or anything, all I expected was to be paid my normal rate and they didn't want to pay even that so I clocked out and left.  At the beginning of my next shift they were angry; they expected me to clock out and then work over an hour for free...every single shift (these were only 5 hour shifts too!).  I refused.  The next week they posted a new schedule with my shift ending an hour later.  Since everyone saw the list, they all got mad.  I guess they were all just fine with wage theft until one person refused.  The next week everyone had an extra hour on their shifts.  At this point his wage theft scheme had failed.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and this new manager doesn't come in on Thursday.  He doesn't come in until Monday.  No schedule is posted.  Monday afternoon I go in to get my check and say, \"see you next week\".  I'm told my shift started half an hour ago.  I say I made plans since I wasn't on the schedule (no schedule means I couldn't be on it).  The manager point to a schedule posted on the wall, printed just hours before (after some of the shifts on it had already started).  I thanked him for posting next week's schedule early and started to leave.  Then I was threatened with termination, and I kept walking.  Came back a week later and talked with the daytime guy doing the same job.  He said it was a bad week; many machines were down and he was walking around with like $100 in tokens because he was spending much of his time giving refunds, to the point he didn't have enough uninterrupted time to make any repairs.  He was also keeping a roll of masking tape with him to tape over the coin slots as the machines failed.  This meant a lot more use on the remaining machines, which started to show it quickly.  I go to clock in and was told I had been fired.  I smiled and walked out.\n\nSpoke with the daytime guy a while later.  Apparently they never filled my position (people with mechanical and electrical knowledge willing to work minimum wage are rare).  Instead he was getting 14 hours a week in time-and-a-half overtime (with a base pay almost twice what I was getting).  This extra expense came out of the department budget, which also paid for replacement parts (even before this it was never enough to buy enough parts).  This 'from the department budget' thing was from the same manager; he didn't want normal payroll to go up.  For a while basically everyone was carrying around $20 in tokens to give refunds, but all the comps were unacceptable to the manager so now only the sales desk could issue refunds...which meant ordering pizza took forever and many people just left angry rather than waiting for a refund.  Most machines had tape over the token slots.  This backup at the sales desk didn't last long, as few people were coming and no one was booking parties anymore.  Other than staff it was basically empty.  It didn't even smell like pizza anymore.  With no customers, the daytime guy finally had time to make repairs...but didn't have the parts to do most repairs.  As far as I know that manager stayed there until the place went under ~8 months after I was fired for not working a shift that his own rules said I could not work.\n\nTLDR: New manager's rules and laziness combine to destroy a once thriving business.",

        "text": "I’ve joined a drama group that’s entirely focused on drama games. Before we begin, everyone forms a circle and we say our name, our pronouns “if we would like to share them” and mention something that happened to us this week. Since it began a few weeks ago, most people shared their pronouns. I’m one of about  3/4 out of 15 people who chose not to, so I’m not the only one who hasn’t. Nothing has been made of this, but I feel tense about it. I feel like- for those who us who identify what they clearly appear, which is all but one, it’s ridiculous to the point of parody. I’m happy to call someone what they want to be called, but I find the expectation to announce my pronouns in a group setting incredibly silly. I was happy with people correctly assuming my pronouns and the idea they shouldn’t do so, just in case I think otherwise, I think is hilarious. \n\nBecause of this, I’m considering pointing it out by driving this idea to its extreme- by declaring myself gender fluid and wearing a garishly feminine tee and requesting people use the neopronouns “Que/ quem rather than he/ him when referring to me. Also maybe switching my pronouns every week. If the gate has opened up for us to use any pronouns we want then there’s a long list of pronouns online with various connotations and so why not explore this concept to its full potential to enrich my life in a slightly unconventional way? \n\nI’m posting this to get peoples opinions and discuss possible repercussions I might face. I would rather not be thrown out of the group as I really enjoy the group, but it’s gonna bother me to not say my pronouns and it will bother me to say them. I’m worried I won’t be able to keep a straight face with this request. Am I being un-inclusive? I really want to mock this emerging expectation, so why not take it as far as it can go? Happy to hear peoples thoughts on this… kind of hoping the post doesn’t blow up too much. \n\nAs a side note, just recently, there’s a single gender neutral person in the group. Turns out person actually attends a place in which I work, but in a different context. I found this out when I ran into them the other day. I’m not trying to single them out and I don’t want this to be thought of as an exercise in bullying. But, well, am I playing the wrong kind of drama games here? Please share your thoughts.",

        "text": "I was working with a group of contractors, we all got along very well except for one woman.  She was in her 50's and had raised a family before returning to school and starting a career.  Her husband was a senior employee in the contracting firm, that's the only reason she was hired, we all knew this but she side stepped it every time the conversation was working its way around to that.  Somehow she qualified for a MBA program with no work experience aside from part time in a sewing shop and got her degree.  Well done right? Good for her?\n\nNot so fast. \n\nShe was insufferable.  And VERY money hungry.  Her goal was to bill $1000 per hour.  (she was billing $150) Not a day went by without her mentioning her degree, the university, that she was a  mentor to some poor sap, etc.  How do I know this?  Well, I started to get embarrassed for her, then embarrassed for myself and the other contractors who were associated with her.  Then I started to wonder if I was being fair, so... every time she mentioned her degree, uni, etc I would put a check mark on my paper day calendar.  It was a funny calendar so instead of ripping off the days I flipped them over and saved them.  After a few months I remembered why I was doing the check marks and went back and reviewed. Every day had at least one check, often more, except when she went on vacation.\n\nAt the same time she tried to position herself as our manager.  We didn't have a manager as we were all working on different client projects at the client site.  We worked in the same room, but that was it.  We were suddenly 'her team' and she was offering to intercede on our behalf with the employer for training etc.  It was obnoxious, but instead of making a fuss we just ignored her.  Until...\n\nShe got a transfer working for the UK NHS.  She was thrilled.  We all knew she was just a seat filler that allowed the contractor to bill hours regardless if she did any work or not.\n\nBecause she was leaving to go overseas she couldn't take her relatively new laptop with her, instead it had to go to the employee with the oldest one - me.\n\nShe had all her personal files in one folder which she deleted then handed me the laptop.  She started to get nervous and asked me to empty the recycle bin on the laptop.  'Sure!  no problem'.  Did I mention we all worked in IT and that she had no computer background?\n\nI waited until she left for the day and everyone said their goodbyes then I recovered the deleted folder.\n\nOMFG.  Turns out she was writing performance reviews for all the staff at that client site, and the reviews were horrible.  She had no business writing reviews, she wasn't our manager.  I of course copied the other staff on what she had been saying so we could do damage control.\n\nAlso included were her finances - yikes!  They sold their house. She and her husband were investing in every get rich quick scheme you could imagine and were losing money hand over fist to charlatans.  There was more but that's all I can recall right now.\n\nShe started sending us emails from 'jolly old england' and using british slang and phrases and asking how 'her team' was.  ugh.  No one ever replied.  We hated her with the fire of a thousand suns.\n\nThe NHS project burst into flames, her husband was fired and she was stuck in England just as the 2008 crash hit.\n\nI used to amuse myself thinking how hard she was ridiculed for mentioning an MBA on the daily in the London business district.\n\nThe moral is - don't be a twat to your co-workers, especially if we all work in IT.",

Our office manager at our surveying office would every so often purchase a piece of land and make a subdivision off of it to make extra money.   There was one property he bought and he had to hurriedly send us out to it to mark his property lines since the next day a guy was coming to completely clear and de-stump about the roughly 7 acres lot.  While marking one line, this lady comes out and proceeds to curse us out and ask us what we were doing.  My field crew chief at the time decided to take the “f you, mind your own business!” route.   I thought better of it and decided not to be so brash about things.   Now I knew what was getting ready to happen on the property we were marking, but best business practices are to know as little as possible about what is happening.  I told her that someone had just purchased the lot and wanted to see where his lines were.  She had been mowing some over the property line, and she proceeded\nto tell me that she had broken 4 mowers trying to keep that lot cut back so she had more open space around the house, and she was sick and tired of no one maintaining the lot.  Equipped with the knowledge of what was coming the next day, I told her “well ma’am, I’m a man of action, and I’m going to personally find the guy who has bought his property, I’m going to put my finger in his face, and tell him he had better mow his property as soon as possible or he’s going to be dealing with me about it.   Fast forward to the next morning.   This huge, tank like machine went out and by the end of the day, there wasn’t so much as a stump or tall weed left.  Clean as a pin down to the dirt.   The next day we had to come out and do a topo on the land for the engineer.   I couldn’t resist going and knocking on that ladies door.  She answered and I said “ma’am, I told you I would take care of it.  Anything else you need?”  She said “I just wanted them to mow.”   \n\nOn the positive side we were out there probably another 15-20 times doing the subdivision layout.   She always threatened to shove a wooden stake up my crew chiefs ass, but she told me she liked me and I was welcome on her property anytime.",

Of note, I was the youngest person ever hired to that role.  \nI reported to an Associate Director (our title system was weird) who was great. About a year later, he announced his retirement, and while I was sad he was leaving, I was thrilled that I had his support and was a shoe-in for his job.  \nUnfortunately there was one AD, Lisa, from another group (she was marketing, I was comms) who thought I was a bit of an upstart and didn’t like me much. I left on a planned vacation and returned to find that Lisa had convinced the head of the organization to combine the marketing and comms groups with her as the sole AD. So no promotion for me.  \nAt this point, I was in the middle of a huge project to build and launch a new listserv (it was perpetually 1995 there). I had to coordinate with IT to build the new server, sign up forms, etc. It was for members, and we planned to launch at our annual conference to encourage people to sign up.  \nWell Lisa didn’t think we’d get enough participants if it was opt-in. She wanted us to automatically add all members (~5000) to the list and give them the option to opt OUT. I argued against this as politely as I could for weeks. IT backed me up- no one was going to find/use the unsubscribe link and the minute the first person hit “reply all” to be removed from the list, it was going to explode. But Lisa knew best.  \nSo the day of the conference comes and I ask IT to be on call, even though it’s a weekend and they’re technically off. I confirm, in writing, one last time with Lisa that this is opt OUT. She says yes, Elle, how many times do I have to say it!? Opt OUT.  \nSo the head of the organization makes an announcement about the list during her opening speech, and we go live.  \nIT called me within about 15-20 minutes because the server was so inundated with reply all emails that it was crashing. We scrapped the entire project within an hour.  \nThe head of the organization was livid, but I just forwarded my last email with Lisa.  \nBy the time they offered me Lisa’s job, I had a new position lined up elsewhere with a $33k raise.",

        "text": "In the mid-2000s, I was a Business Development Officer (BDO) for an Asia-based commercial bank in the US. Getting deals booked required the usual internal sales versus credit fight. I wanted to build a book per lending guidelines and credit always boohoo'ed every potential deal.\n\nI tried to get along with that team until the bank brought a new head of credit. Turns out she got her previous bank (a huge Asian bank) fined $50 million booking crap deals by US banking authorities and placed under other restrictions. So she wanted her claws in everything, currently on or about to be booked into the portfolio. \n\nPrior her reign of madness, sales and credit had access to a shared folder which contain sub-folders of all active, completed or pending new deals and their respective documentation. She had her team go through everything to report issues, if any (none really at that time); namely, those booked already and those closed to see if there were mistakes to learn from. I get her point of view and could only laugh when her team griped to me on the sidelines.\n\nI managed my folder in the Impending folder as I worked on a slew of active new and secondary market deals, prior to moving booked to the active folder. We didn't hit it off well as she questioned why I had so many deals ongoing and why she wasn't clued in to what I was doing and that we needed her nod to proceed.\n\nI don't work for her and my boss was pissed as it seemed that she wanted to merge BD under her control. We complained to the general manager who sorta shrugged and said that she wasn't wrong in trying to protect the bank given her $50 million oops elsewhere.\n\nFine!\n\nEach deal's docs (and there were a LOT of docs) made each deal folder come in around 15-25 megabytes. So I blasted her and her team each deal folder one at a time (including those under consideration). Also, included the GM.\n\nI jammed up their Outlook inbox for weeks which delayed new business to the point that the GM told her she's clogging up the servers (IT complained about storage overload, mind you that disk drives were kinda expensive back then) and flat-lining his business growth (Head Office questioned his deal fall-off). She fought to keep this madness for 6 months.\n\nThe other BDOs did the same as I. We kept at it until the GM shut her down. During that time, she lost two analysts and couldn't replace them them for over a year. She ended to A LOT of the work herself since the remaining analysts were a bit too junior for her tastes.\n\nAsk for trouble and thou shall receive....",

        "text": "Country back road Karma\n\nMy alma mater college campus is atop a mesa in a small mountain town in Colorado.  In the early 90's, it was accessible by 2 lane country road. This road is in an undeveloped part of town with small ranches, full of wildlife.  At that time, I had lost my license due to a misunderstanding on my part with the law, but I had to get to class.  My wife normally drove, but that day I was solo.  So I followed the rules of the road to the letter.  I'm driving to class and it's a no passing zone.  There is no oncoming traffic, and this guy is tailgating me bad.  Like a foot off my bumper bad.  We are the only ones out there.  He loses his patience, and hammers past me.  Adios, amigo.  As he speeds away, I see something fly off the roof of his sports car.  Im not a tree hugger mind you, but Colorado is my home state and this jackwagon with out of state plates is just letting his jerkiness shine through.  I thought he threw trash out of his sun roof at me.  I pull over to pick it up.  Lo and behold, it's not trash.\n\nIt's this guys wallet.  With his out of country drivers license.  I want to say Germany but definitely Europe.  The exciting part was the $400+ in cash in the wallet.\n\nNow, Im a poor college dude.  My wife and I put ourselves through school, zero help from anyone.  Paid all expenses, rent, utilities, car repairs, tuition, you name it WE did it.  We watched many of our college friends go skiing and on trips with their well to do families and eat out.  Not us.  If we got a burger at McD's, we felt like royalty. Egg sandwiches and ramen were a feast. But, one thing we did do that was totally stupid was take trips on credit cards.  We ended up racking up 20k+ in cc debt and filing bankruptcy ultimately, but we had a trip planned not 2 weeks in the future when this all went down.\n\nHowever, my wife says I am honest to a fault.  I was really struggling because here's some money that would really help, but even though this person was a jerk, they are from out of the country.  It's one thing to be an American and lose your wallet and ID, but a foreigner?  So, I ultimately decided to return the wallet to the police station because that was the right thing to do.  When they asked if there was money in it, \"Nope.  It was empty.\"  The better question for the cop to ask would have been \"Was there money in it when you first touched the wallet?\"\n\nThat was such a great trip with some extra cash.  If you're going to be a jerk while driving, check to make sure you have your wallet in your pocket first.",

The party gets raided by police and I was led to the patrol car where a police officer provided me the instructions for a breathalyzer test so he could issue me a ticket for under-age drinking. He told me to take a deep breath, put the instrument that measures my blood alcohol content in my mouth, and then exhale. I followed his instructions maliciously. I took a deep breath, put the device in my mouth, and exhaled – I registered a 0.00. The police officer smiles wryly at me (recognizing my malicious compliance) and says – do it again, but this time exhale through your mouth (the previous time I had only exhaled through my nose).  I, of course, then tested positive and received my ticket. My malicious compliance only bought me about a minute delay in getting the ticket, but it was nonetheless satisfying.",

        "text": "This story happened about a decade ago when I was still a teenager and used to live in my parents' house. We are migrants and are on good terms with all the neighbours since the 90s but we do have a reputation in the neighbourhood of frequently undertaking ambitious DYI home improvements and in atypical manner to what locals expect. \n\nOur house is separated from the neighbours with a living hedge wall of cypress trees that grow on our property. At the time of this story, we already lived in the house for the better part of the decade with the same neighbours and the same cypress trees.  \n\nOne day out of the blue, one of the neighbours sees my mom working in the garden and starts complaining about the state of the living hedge on her side of the property. We usually trim the hedge only from our side and most of the top that we can reach. The neighbour complains and demands us to trim the hedge from their side as well. In her eyes, as the hedge wall is planted on our property, it's 100% our responsibility and they are tired of maintaining it from their side. The altercation is very brief as my mother surprisingly quickly replies \"OK\" and walks off grinning.\n\nUnbeknown to the neighbour, we already were planning to cut down the hedges to the stump so that they could regrow anew, as the existing hedge was very old and was not particularly sightly. Previously we postponed these works as we did not want to upset the neighbours, but this demand provided the perfect excuse. So the next day while the neighbours are at work, we cut down all the hedges surrounding our property to barely above ground.\n\nAs we are finishing clearing up the trimmings the neighbours come back home from work shocked to discover the hedge practically gone. They look around and realise that with the hedge wall gone, their whole backyard, kitchen, living room and bedroom are on full display through the windows.\n\nThe neighbour questions what have we done and why as they would no longer have any privacy in their own home. My mom without missing a beat replies \"we fixed the problem, the hedge will no longer need trimming from your side\" and goes back to clearing up.\n\nWithin a week the neighbours came back to us and asked for permission to construct a wooden fence on our property to protect their privacy. We happily agreed as long as they paid for it all, as we didn't mind waiting a couple of years for the hedge to regrow (our privacy was much less impacted). They built the fence within the week and it provided a good surface for some vine flowers to grow instead of the cypress trees that my mother had wanted to plant for a long time. \n\nTLDR; neighbour wants us to take care of the hedge wall on their side and instead is forced to construct a wooden fence out of pocket to protect their privacy.",

        "text": "I was recently reminded of this story from a colleague. I work in contracts meaning my department audits signed documents to make sure everything is legal and compliant with our policies. We have a very old system that we use (think early DOS. Like a black screen with white words and you type everything manually. Looks like Pong).\n\n\nSo typically what happens is I would get a contract for specific mechanical equipment and I would review to make sure it's possible in a physical sense and that the finances also make sense. Occasionally we will encounter a situation where we need to update our system to allow a contract to go through. This would be if we sold an older equipment that we no longer build but had a few spares lying around. Or if a client bought our equipment from a 3rd party provider but wants us to service it since we're the official company that makes this stuff. It's kind of like a car dealership selling a used car that they don't make anymore. It's still part of their brand but they might not necessarily have software to support it since it's so outdated. Trying to explain best I can.\n\n\nWhen we have these types of contracts with older equipment, all we have to do is send a note to a person in a specific department and ask her to open the system temporarily to allow these devices to be added and serviced. The way we send this request is that we fill out a form and submit it to this lady. \n\n\nThis lady is... Something. She's a combination of a power hungry overlord and a scared pathetic mouse. It's very interesting to see. I sometimes play a game to bet on which mode she will respond with. She's very much a bully who cries when she gets called out for being a bully and then says she's being bullied... yeah. She's fun.\n\n\nSo anyways, one day I received 85 new contracts (same client) all for used equipment that we don't make anymore and have not for years. Someone found a whole bunch of them for dirt cheap and bought them and now want us to service them. Cool. Good find mister client. We will be happy to help. \n\n\nTypically you submit 1 request form per device. Filling out the form is bit of a pain because it's a very manual process and a bit time consuming. I like to be efficient and make life easier so I did some reviewing and noticed that there are really only like 5 models of machines. 85 different serial numbers but only 5 types. So I sent off a quick email saying the following:\n\n\n\"Hi Lady! (Not her name but I'm calling her that here) I have a whole bunch of machines to add to the system but I don't want to submit 85 different tickets to you lol. I checked and saw there's only 5 model types. Can I send you the request in batches by model? Might make our lives a bit easier than going one by one.\" \n\n\nNow this lady is notorious for sticking to the rules. I don't usually mind because rules exist for a reason HOWEVER they were also created by people and therefore can be changed by people. In this instance I was hoping Lady would understand that I'm trying to save us both some time. Nope. Her response was:\n\n\n\"It is unacceptable that you think you have the right to change the way we do things. Especially that you don't even work in my department and have no concept of what it is that I do. We do not work however we want. We have procedures to follow and if you are unfamiliar with these procedures then it is clear to me that you need training.\"\n\n\nA new level of bitch has been achieved.\n\n\nYou want me to follow procedures? You don't want to understand that I'm trying to help us both? Let's go then.\n\n\nI spent the next three hours creating my emails/ticket requests. But I didn't submit them as I went. Oh no. I waited until I had 85 of them ready to go. Once they were loaded I spent a hilarious moment clicking send. It was like I was launching little torpedoes every time I clicked send. Each causing small devastation as they build up in her inbox and overshadow anything else that might have been in her queue. Also I know she keeps the volume on so I know she was hearing that damn DING! that has traumatized Outlook users everywhere. One by one 85 different requests were running to her inbox like moths to a flame. \n\n\nI waited for the inevitable tantrum. \n\n\n\"Hey, I see you're sending me a bunch of requests can't you just bunch them together? This is a lot and it's messing up my system now due to the constant influx of emails and tickets.\"\n\n\nDid I forget to mention that our laptops are also super old? That many emails in one shot most definitely froze her Outlook for some time. \n\n\nI replied:\n\"Oh sorry that you're having a hard time. I was just following procedure as per your request. I already sent them all so nothing I can do.\"\n\n\n\"Well how many requests did you send?\"\n\n\n\"85\"\n\n\n\"What?!?!?\"\n\n\nI then put my status to \"out to lunch\"\n\n\nHave fun lady. I'm getting a sandwich.",

        "text": "This is something that happened at a school where I taught adults who were mentally impaired, either from birth or after events that left them impaired. We got them a level 1 degree, which is the most basic of basic degrees, but one that could help them find a job. I quit, so I am comfortable sharing this story.\n\nWhen I was there I worked along with a coworker I will call B. B was an incredibly kind soul and the students loved him. He loved teaching, he loved sports, but he also loved to be alone. B had no immediate family, no relationship, and just a few close friends. Unfortunately fate sometimes gives you a bad roll of the dice, and he got incredibly ill with covid. It landed him in the hospital, and his lungs quit on him due to being weakened by a nasty cancer that he was fighting. \n\nHe passed away, and after our mourning, the manager went to HR to get the paperwork done. However, there appeared to be an issue. The only way the paperwork could be done to clear his position post-mortem was if the death was sudden, some BS rule. Being in the hospital for over a week, it was not seen as sudden. B had all opportunity to resign before he died. \n\nAs he had no immediate family, there also was no one who could resign from the position in his name, another BS rule. Basically, if something gave HR work, they had a rule that shoved the effort elsewhere. We also could not \"fire\" him post mortem as we had a list of reasons was given to pick from, and nothing resembling death was allowing us a reason to fire him. B was not allowed to leave.\n\nSo we rolled with it. We kept B in our team, he got working hours that we all picked up for him as B did not show up (who thought!) and lets fast forward three weeks. HR called manager, they asked why B has not shown up to work for three weeks without notice. Manager said, plain as day, that B died but HR wanted to keep him in the position. They asked if it was sudden, manager said no, as it was nit sudden according to HR\"s description of sudden. They asked why he didn't resign before he died. Basically the whole same conversation. Manager said that HR's rules kept him around post mortem, and he was not planning on digging him up to come to work. \n\nHR would work on it, so we grabbed our popcorn. Fast forward another 3 weeks. HR again called, again asking the same questions. Manager this time didnt say that B died, he played around a bit. He said he tried calling B, but he didn't answer his phone. So HR said that manager should consider firing him then. It was silent in the office, manager rested his face on the desk and mumbled \"fine\" as he hung up. HR forgot that B had died. \n\nSo as told, B was fired for not showing up to work for the month after his death. I'm pretty sure he is up there on a cloud laughing his butt off as he would have loved the way we complied with it all.",

There was a line of grannies who didn’t know how to work the ATM and wanted to have some spending cash. In comes Karen. \n\nShe comes in huffing and puffing dead fox around her neck and in her finest fur coat.\nShe pushes past everyone and screams at me: “ How dare you! Do you have any idea who I am! How dare you embarrass me like that! My credit card was maxed out! I have a 50.000 dollar credit and I didn’t use this card! Do you have any idea how I feel having it declined !!! “ \n\nI quickly check what is going on and I see someone spend it all in one night at club “Luxury”. A well know high end club for … you know… sex workers.\nPeople often don’t realize that if you take a credit card, even if you have two plastic cards it is still the same credit line. Her husband and her both had a card but it was the same 50.000 they were spending. I could see it was her husbands card who spend this amount. \n\n“Ma’m, I am sorry for the inconvenience but I see there was a large purchase recently, come on in and my colleagues will sort this out for you” \n\n“ I didn’t purchase anything” she huffed! “So I was robbed!?”\n\nI really wanted her inside so we could handle this in private. “ I don’t think so Ma’m but do come inside so we can handle this in private” \nI was hoping the ‘in private‘ had her realizing she was broadcasting her issues to the legion of gossip grannies this town has. \n\nShe lost it: “ you want to hide your mistakes huh! I was robbed! You want to silence me”\n\n-“No Ma’m I think it is a misunderstanding I see it was your husband who made the purchase that is probably where the confusion comes from, please come inside so we can get this sorted out for you” \n\n- LIAR My husband has his own card this is impossible! \n\nI tried one last time to beg her to come inside but she chose violence and grabbed my computer screen and turned it around… I quickly turned it back but she saw the transactions in club ”Luxury”. \n\n“ See! She cried out victorious! I am being robbed , I don’t know what the heck club “Luxury” is! ( granted the name does not sound so wrong by itself, but  everybody who lives here knows what it is, I couldn’t believe her penny didn’t drop sooner) \n\nShe demanded to know what that was! She asked for my manager and I called for him but asked her to please, please please! Go inside. \nI wanted to save her the realization she just outed her husbands escapades to everyone.\n\nMy manager took his sweet sweet time. And she kept screaming at me. She demanded to know what club Luxury is. She asked her audience to help her out these thieving banks! Asking someone to look it up, but her geriatric onlookers didn’t have to, they knew. \n\nI finally said ma’m it is a nightclub. \nWhile one of the grannies chimed in: nah it is a place full of company for rent , go yell at your cheating husband ! \n\nShe got white in the face and probably remembered the sign she must have driven past 1000nds of times ! “ Club Luxury, new girls every night”\n\nShe huffed she would have me fired for this but no complaint ever came. She just kinda ran out of there. \n\nPeeps: if a bank receptionist asks you to please come inside to handle things…. Please do so!",

        "text": "I have always been interested in electronics and did a lot of reading and studying on my own, and I was very good at buying things at swap meets and repairing them and reselling them as a teen.  My first real paying job, a friend of my mom knew a guy who ran a place that supplied answering machines to businesses.  They were new tech back at that point in time.  She said he was desperate for someone who could fix them as he had ones with issues spilling over the shelves.  So I went to see him.  \n\nIt was an interesting meeting, a middle aged businessman and me, I was gees, 15 or so.  We kind of eye each other and he asks me if I can fix them.  I was pretty sure I could, and when he pulled out the service manuals for them, he had a couple that were based on the same base, I was quite sure.  So he asks me what I wanted an hour, and I was used to getting $3 an hour for watching the kiddo next door on occasion so I asked for that.  He pondered that for a minute and made me an offer I could not refuse:  $10, cash for each one I fix.  I quickly agree and agreed to stop by after school the next day with my tools to dig in.  \n\nThe next day I show up and he takes me in the back and sure enough he has a couple big sets of industrial shelves overflowing with the things.  I start pulling them off and looking at them,  He gives me a smile and drifts off and leaves me to it.\n\nI quickly discovered this guy had no tech skills what so ever.  None, nada.  Most of them had a brainlessly simple problem: The outgoing message was kept on a big loose loop of tape with a metallic splice at the end/beginning that went past two posts and that told the thing the tape had went all the way around and to stop and turn on the cassette recorder for the incoming message.  The splices and the posts got dirty and did not make good contact and the tape would just go on forever.  About 3 minutes with some alcohol and a Q tip cleaning those parts as well as the other things in the tape path not only had them going again but sounding like new.   I cleaned the front panels up with some spray cleaner and hit the wooden cases with some lemon pledge and they would look like new.  I spent more time carefully coiling up the power cords than repairing them, but when I was done they looked and sounded like new.\n\nThe owner came back to check on me a couple hours later to see if I was going to be able to \"crank one out for him that night\" and I pointed to a pile of 5 or so and told him to check them out.  His eyes just about popped out of his head.  I got near 10 done a night for a while.  It did slow down a bit once I got the easy ones knocked out, but I just kept picking the low hanging fruit and learning more and more about them, and getting deeper and deeper into them.  He also had units coming in all the time so I did still have some easy ones mixed in with the bunch.\n\nI thought he was going to soil himself when we settled up at the end of the first week, I had spent like 3 afternoons there and got near 30 of them fixed.  It was a really good payday.  He was not super happy with our agreement but he had proposed it and he had someone who was kicking ass getting them fixed so he was cornered into honoring it.  It was not lost on him that he could have been paying me like $12 a night and I would have been happy with that, but he thought he would get the better of me.",

This particular day, the owner saw the parts manager and was fed up. He told me to fix it. As I had warned him several times, this time I sent him home. We had someone else work the store, so no issue.....until owner comes back. \"Where is the parts manager?\" You told me to deal with it so I did by sending him home. Owner was pissed. Told me I had to run the register since I messed up. Ok.....\n\nIt was a busy Saturday and we had lots of buyers. As mentioned,  I approved all deals but was relegated to cashier duty. We lost at least 5-6 sales that day. Owner comes back at closing time to lick his chops on juicy sales...but there were zero. He said \"why didn't you approve the deals?\" I said I worked the station you ordered me to and I was quite busy. I thought you were handling sales today. (He didn't).",

        "text": "I'm sure a lot of you are dealing with this. The Higher-ups want us back in the office. It's extremely unpopular and is being met with a lot of pushback. No one, not me, not my boss, not my bosses boss have been complying. \n\nSo there's this huge conference call where HR is going fire and brimstone on us saying if we don't go in we show up on this report which with enough occurrences could lead to disciplinary action and termination. \n\nA  friend of mine is a bit higher up than I am, and he tells me they're monitoring this through badge swipes.  They came up with some arbitrary number of swipes a person needs to make in order for them to be considered \"in office\". \n\nOh. Ok. \n\nSo, you see, I work as a fraud analyst for a massive bank. You need to swipe your badge every time you go to a different floor, as well as entering and leaving the building. But the report isn't based on dates or times. Only badge swipes. \n\nSo I go into the office one day and swipe my badge. But oh no, that coffee went right through me, so I gotta go to the bathroom. Oh, but it's on the other side of the floor, better cut through the elevators and swipe my badge to get there quicker. Oh, I'm out of water. Gotta go two floors down and swipe my badge to grab water. And then I had to use the restroom again. Then lunch. Then someone on another floor needed to speak with me. Then, I needed to return a cable I borrowed, but that person was away from his desk. And so on and so forth. \n\nThis went on for most of the day. I'm required to be in office 2-3 days a week every week. I'm the only person on the report that's been in 4 days a week for my team since January. \n\nI've been in office twice.",
