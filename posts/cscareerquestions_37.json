I graduated in may of 2021 with a 1st but was pretty depressed at the time so didn't job hunt for a graduate degree straight away and let my coding get pretty rusty, so currently I am working part time as a builder. Recently I've been using code wars and working on mini projects to add to my GitHub like a budget application to improve my coding, and once I've completed some smaller projects I want to make a bigger one to both improve my coding and to show to potential employers.\n\nI'm wondering whether I'm doing the right things to increase my chances of employment and if there is any advice as I am panicking quite a bit that I'm not doing the right things to help myself get a job? I'm also wondering if I've missed out on getting graduate jobs as it's coming up on two years since I graduated?",

I've dabbled in ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, SOAP, WCF, MVC, APIs etc.\n\n9 years of my career has been in banking/fintech. On the last major project I was on, I assumed the tech lead role for around 9 months. I've grown jaded with my current position and another team in the organisation asked me to apply for a role in his space. I assumed that it was a senior developer role, so it'd be a lateral move. Turns out it's an Architect position, in a whole new-to-me stack, Java, Sonic, SpringBoot, AWS etc.\n\nI suffer from imposter syndrome and ADHD. I'm tackling the ADHD in the next 2 weeks with my Dr, and I've knocked their 3 assessments outta the park which keeps some of the imposter syndrome at bay. I was let go from my previous job after 4 months because I \"wasn't at a senior level\". Since then I've been scoring above average at my current organisation for the last 2 years and 9 months of employment. Despite this, the imposter syndrome remains. My current manager seems content to let me sit in my current role while I work on old code, not gaining business exposure to AWS, Lambdas, DynamoDB and the like. This and other toxic cultural changes has pushed me beyond the point of me wanting to stay in my current team and role.\n\nThis is a major step up for me and I really want to succeed, what do you guys  recommend, from experience in interviewing for the Architect role in a new stack? This will be a technical interview.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm pretty  decent at writing functions/subprocesses, I can produce a bubble sort..  what I'm saying is: conceptually, I have devoured those things before  sitting in my lazy ass rather than proceeding further!\n* I also have experimented with  \n\n   * LUA - For TIC-80 stuff\n   * 6502 Assembly - For dicking around\n   * Various BASIC dialects\n   * C/C++ - I never really practiced OOP to the point where it was drilled into my brain, but I'm confident I could do it\n* I have no savings, but am working to save up enough to begin education in Q3 next year (2024)\n* I  have no property, no dependents, no real financial commitments apart  from a loan I'll try to pay off this year, and no love life (just in case  you were curious).\n* I think I want to get my Computer Science degree before going into the job market.\n\nWhen  I first started using computers and learning about developing software,  I was coming at it from a very passionate place; I wanted to create  videogames, and I wanted to do something I loved for a living (little  did I know I'd be spending twenty years enjoying the splendors of Excel  and occasionally getting to write a cool VBA macro).\n\nAt  this point, I am enjoying programming more with every new concept and  idea I actually learn (I mean, I like when something seems complex, and I  bang my head off the table for a few days, and then the things that  once scared me suddenly are easy as piss. I'm maybe not the best  learner, but I do have the capacity to learn through repetition).\n\nHowever,  I am also keen to put an end to my \"minimum wage + $1 days\". So, I'm  wanting to get into a field that I can become decent at with a few years  of hard work, where I'll still be able to get a job at 40, and where  there's enough well-paying jobs that I can really make a good little  living for myself.\n\nA few ideas I had were:\n\n* App  development - I've no idea what that market is like, but I'd have  thought it was pretty lucrative? I was thinking a combination of Swift  and Javascript (neither of which I've started), plus my design skills,  would allow me to build a nice portfolio while I study and hopefully get  hired right out of university.\n* Web development - Again, I could really hustle the Javascript side of things, and try to re-learn PHP and Wordpress modding.\n* Game  development - But everyone seems to be doing it and I'm concerned about  what my chances to make a living (even with mobile gaming apps) would  be.\n* Becoming  an IT teacher - I really enjoy talking and teaching people about  things. I think I'd be a good high school or university teacher.\n* Focusing  on eCommerce - Sadly, I've seen too many of my clients make decent  money to completely avoid the idea of doing the same thing myself.  Building websites to sell products might not be the most fulfilling  thing, but it could be great financially.\n\nI'm  really keen to hear if any of you have any ideas about this kind of  thing. Sorry to all of you for the long piece of text, and sorry to  myself for fucking up my career path for so long. I blame a combination  of mental health and the decline of nu-metal.",
