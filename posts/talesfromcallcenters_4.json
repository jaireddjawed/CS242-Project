Due to a large amount of fraud the last few years everyone who wants to claim these benefits need to have their identity verified. In the past when it was only a few people that needed to verify their identity this could be done by visiting an office.  That is no longer an option. The people much much higher than me have decided that one one specific company can do the identity verifications for us.  \n\nThis company has multiple ways to do it. You can create an account on their site and upload documents. You can do a video call or even go to select locations of another company that is working with them to have your identity verified.\n\nThis person however is flatly refusing to do so. He just does not want to follow our procedure. He flatly refuses to do anything with this third party. He has been informed by a few of my coworkers and a manager that if he does not use this third party then we are unable to help him.\n\nI had to terminate the call I was on with him after going around in circles because we were not going anywhere. I did tell him why I was terminating the call and repeated his options.\n\nI do agree with him partially that there should be a way to proceeded without this third party but there is not and we have been told that there will not be other options. I also suspect I will end up getting him again.\n\nSo fellow call center people how would you handle this type of call?",

Well today I was setting up a prior authorization for inpatient surgery and I was explaining to the provider what I was doing so that way it wouldn’t be too much dead air. The provider stated “I love that you’re telling me what you’re doing” and I replied “Yeah I love doing prior authorizations.” She said “You do?” And I said hesitantly “Yeah it’s a smooth process, it’s very simple”. And she said “well that’s a good spirit to have.” Afterwards I was like hmm…why did she ask me that then I was like OMGG. Like I totally dismissed the fact that this is a patient who is going to have a surgical procedure and surgery can be scary. No one should be excited to set up prior authorizations because it’s sad that the patient is suffering from injury. Ehhh I feel so bad. Like that’s was very insensitive of me and this is why I don’t like making unnecessary comments to callers.",

        "text": "I recently got a new full time job with benefits as a tech support position for a medical device manufacturer and I deal with customers who purchased this medical device for their own use. The job is mostly taking inbound calls from customers having trouble with their medical device and other related things that connect to the medical device. Every call we have to document and use a script for and we have to identify the problem and use the correct script for that problem. The calls are back to back and we do have metrics but they aren't horrible. I believe it's like less than a few QA's in a months period and average at least 80% adherence rate.\n\nBecause most of the callers are rely on this medical device for their own health its really important we document and go through proper troubleshooting and following HIPPAA protocols. The job pays about $18 an hour starting and it's fully work from home. On an average 8 hour shift, I get about 2 calls on average per hour because it takes some time to document and send RMA's and replacements, etc.. Most people are fine but about 2-3 callers a day are just extremely rude and are demanding when I'm trying to help them troubleshoot their problem. I apologize and I'm as friendly as I can be, but that never seems to diffuse the situation and it's always a struggle dealing with these types of customers and honestly it stresses me out for no good reason. \n\nHow do you all deal with rude or demanding customers? I'm not allowed to hang up unless they start cursing at me or being outright abusive, but if it's just them complaining about our service or how bad of a company we are, I can't just hang up, but I am tech support and it is a customer service role, although it's just like how am I suppose to deal with a rude customer complaining about a service when I'm just there to troubleshoot their medical device?? I can't authorize a replacement medical device for free without proper troubleshooting and demanding/yelling isn't going to do anything but confuse and prolong the situation..",

I do the training, it's calling clients and offering appointments to policy holders. \n\nI started in the summer so there were fewer claims. The workload was great and the policy holders were generally nice. I am slowly given more responsibilities like invoicing and quotations. I work very hard and am offered a permenant role, its is less pay than as an agency worker but I need the stability.  Then it goes to shit. \n\nMy coworker suddenly quit and is not replaced, I take on their workload. A manager comes into work drunk one day and then goes off sick, I am sworn to secrecy. The coworker has still not been replaced and we slowly get more and more claims in as the weather changes. I am staying in late to check and recheck my work for mistakes, because I am given \"friendly feedback\" regardless of the fact I am doing 2 peoples workload. There is me and one other person on shift, they go on lunch and I take calls back to back nonstop, I get 45 seconds in between calls to make notes. \n\nI find out there are call audts and I am being marked down for saying \"improper\" words like \"brilliant\" and \"great\". My toilet breaks are timed and I get \"friendly feedback\" if I go over the limit of 6 minutes. I get punished if I do not memorise the policy documents that are 30+ pages long and differ for each client. I also take calls for a different office when they are closed, I have little training on how their system works but I get \"friendly feedback\" for making mistakes anyway . \n\nThere are other things as well. I am writing this because I am waiting to be told off tomorrow for costing the company money for logically doing what the client instructed me to do with the incorrect information I received. I have also been ill with covid and they have done nothing but make my life harder, I am struggling to talk on calls because I take so many in a row and end up not being able to breathe. I missed a training session because nobody told me about it (and was ill with covid) and then had snide comments made about me by management. \n\nLesson learnt, I am 👌 this close to quitting and will never go above and beyond again.",

Caller is calling from Memphis, and judging from the zip code a nicer part of the city. She explains to me that she had been working with movers all day, and they had just gotten to the utility room. They were going to set up her washer, but when they wheeled it over and looked at the drain for it, there was human poop sitting on top of the drain catch. Her movers would not do the install with the special remains in place, and would not clean it for her. She was calling  a plumber to get the shit out of the drain, and see if there was a blockage somewhere causing the backup. All of this is well and good, until she describes the way the drain screen was set up. \n\nThere was absolutely no way that this shit came up through the drain. Apparently the screen completely covered the drain, and her brown loaf of love was sitting perfectly on top of the screen, neatly covering it almost completely. Instantly, I know what happened: someone was in this house before the water was on, and whether through malicious intent or not had decided that the washer drain in the utility room was the best place to leave their human wastes. The absurdity of the call hits me as I am reading her message to the technician back to her for accuracy. I get as far as saying, \"Caller states there is human feces blocking her washer drain...\" before I dissolved into a fit of hysterical giggles that would NOT stop.\n\nI felt horrible, but I couldn't stop laughing for the rest of the phone call. At one point she states, \"You know, on my end this REALLY isn't funny, and you are kind of being disrespectful.\" And I was. And I owned up to it. The end of the call was me apologizing for my rude behavior between fits of laughter. I'm still not proud of this, it's one of the few times that my professional demeanor flew right out the window and never looked back.\n\nBut in all fairness, the phone call was hysterical. I never found out for sure if my theory was correct.",

She had managed to shut her water off, but it was still coming up from the drains. I'm going as fast as I can, confirming name, phone, and address, and the entire time she is asking me questions that I am carefully avoiding. Finally she point blank asks me, \"well you are in the office, why can't you walk me through this? Why can't you help me?\"\n\nFor some reason I went into pure honesty mode. \"Ma'am, I'm sorry but you don't want my assistance. I don't know the first thing to do with a tool box, I'm a gay man and they keep me on the phones for a reason.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a moment of silence and I think, \"Oh shit I just fired myself.\" Then she bursts out in hysterical laughter.\n\n\"That is the most refreshingly honest thing anyone has told me in years. How soon will a tech call me back?\"\n\nI breathe a sigh of relief, let her know I am calling him as soon as we are off the phone, and will ask him to call her as soon as he can. She laughs again, thanks me, and hangs up.\n\nI felt good that I was able to get her what she needed, and get her a laugh despite the stressful situation. Also, the technician was able to solve half of her problem over the phone, and made it out to her a couple hours later. All in all a good call.",

        "text": "Recently I started to work for a major telecom as customer support. I like the company because they take zero crap and are willing to call people out on it. This is one of the short stories in my time here.  \n  \nMe: Obviously me.  \nDC: Demanding Customer  \n  \nMe: Hi welcome to Telecom, I am Aelonius, what can I do for you.\nDC: Hi, so in the store I was told my subscription without phone would cost me around $45 a month, but I see here that I paid $55 for that month. Why?  \n  \nSo this happens sometimes, mostly because the customer has to take action and failed to do so.   \n  \nMe: Miss, did you activate BonusBundle on your account?  \nDC: No? I thought I had one!!  \nMe: Let me verify your data.   \n  \nTurns out the lady changed plans which made OldBonus obsolete, which she claims our store forgot to tell her. Okay, that happens and sometimes if I feel it benefits them, I can credit them something as a gesture.  \n  \nMe: Miss, I see here that you shifted from OldBonus to NewBonus but because these terms are not met by your account, it does not apply to you.  \nDC: God damn it the store told me it would.... Cant you fix this?  \nMe: Technically no, as it is bound by your plan and not by my control. Let me double check that though.  \n  \nBefore I even could, she dropped the line  \nDC: What if I threaten to leave  \n  \nMe: Sure ma'am. I will look what your termination fee is, so I can make that happen. We do not accept threats of leaving to try and conduct business, and if that means we lose you as a customer then that is acceptable by our company.  \n  \nDC: oh.... Well I think it is bad service!  \n  \nMe in my head: Tough shit lady, threats dont work and get you zero.\n  \n  \n**Edit:**  \n  \nIt is our company policy to try and help where people can, but only to credit people when it legitimately is something that applies to the case. Ideally if we do have some crediting, it is something non-financially but we can't avoid it in some cases. However, we also do not credit based on threats or manipulation of agents. My own way of handling this consists of a few steps. I always let customers know that practically policy is unable to cover it (if that is true). I follow this up by looking at any edge cases that could apply to her situation (and communicate this to the customer) but also say explicitly that while I will do my best, I give no guarantees. If the customer is polite (yes you can be polite when angry) and is willing to accept that there will not be a perfect solution but that I stick my neck out to try and help her, then I am inclined to grant some form of compensation. But if the customer starts cussing, threatening and otherwise manipulating me as an agent, I have the right by policy to deny any credit to this customer unless this was prior decided, or if it is a 100% mistake on our end.\n\nLady in this story had zero right to any compensation as the terms of the contract clearly describes how these work. She failed to read what she signed for and waited until her \"free cancellation\" period was over before she called about the discount she was told would work. If she then doesn't allow the person searching for a way to find a way, she won't get any and it is her loss.",

        "text": "This is not my story, but it happened to a friend of mine from the first call center job that I had. My friend’s name is Cheryl. Cheryl is a sweetheart. She is a middle-aged woman counting down to retirement so she can spend more time with her niece and nephew. She always has something nice to say. For some reason (we always secretly suspected she was Hitler in a past life) Cheryl would always get the most awful and unbearable callers. You know the type. The people that don’t want to listen to reason, or that don’t understand you aren’t with the actual office, or the kind of person that just wants to be a bitch in your bag. Cheryl ALWAYS got these people. This is more of a collection of Cheryl incidents than any one story so bear with me.\n\nThe first one that I can think of, and the one that really bonded me with her, is this one. We were working late one night, and Cheryl got a call from one of our clients that offered free shipping through various web portals at a monthly membership cost. I’ve written a little about that company in the past, and how the customers usually signed up by accident for a free trial membership at checkout. This was definitely one of those times, with the added benefit that the person she was speaking with did not speak English as their first language. She had been trying to explain how he had signed up and that we were able to cancel at this time if that is what he wanted. I had been half listening, when suddenly I hear her say rather loudly, “Please, sir, explain to me why I am such a bitch! Oh really? Well thank you for that information sir, and have a great night!” She explained immediately that after the third time of her beginning to explain why the customer was being billed he started to call her a bitch and repeatedly asked if she knew why she was a bitch. When she caved, he told her (apparently in a heavy Asian accent) “You are such a bitch because you stick hot sauce, up your pussy!!” I fell out of my office chair laughing when I heard. Cheryl was laughing so hard she was crying. For the entire rest of the time we worked together, we would refer to her as the saucy bitch or the spicy bitch. There are members of the staff that still give her hot sauce for Christmas.\n\n\\*\n\nAnother time, she was speaking with someone that needed to have a plumber come out to their home for a blockage. The man was being rather obtuse and was refusing to confirm basic information like name and phone number. He was also trying to insist that she connect him directly to the technician so they could discuss pricing. That was not how our call handling system was designed, and this particular client specifically requested that we do not connect the customer directly to the technician, but to text the technician all pertinent information, and he would call the customer back. Eventually their conversation broke down, and I hear from her, “Sir, I understand you want to speak with the technician. I have all of the information that I need and I will have him call you back. Good night.” She hung up on him, turned to me and said, “I’m the Door, bitch, and if you fuck with me your door of opportunities gets closed.” She said it so stone-faced and so coldly that it cracked me up and I immediately wrote the following story about her:\n\n“Once Upon a Time, there was a girl named Cheryl. She didn't always realize it, but Cheryl had a special power: she could Decide things. It wasn't just anything she could Decide; she had the power to give you water or deny it; assist with medical needs or let you die; put a roof over your head or leave you in the open environment. You see, Cheryl was the Door Bitch, and you never wanted to make her angry, or your Door of Opportunities would close.”\n\n\\*\n\nOne night when we were bored and there was a low call volume we got to talking and I learned that she grew up on a farm and would frequently have to chase down pigs that had escaped. For some reason it inspired me again, and this time I wrote a limerick for her:\n\nThere once was a woman named Cheryl\n\nWho went over The Falls in a barrel\n\nSay what you will for such a cheap thrill, \n\nBut it beats chasing pigs which are feral.\n\nI quit working at this call center a number of years ago, but several of her stories have stuck with me over time, and if I can think of any more I may update this or make them their own post. She still works for the company as far as I know. And Cheryl honey, if you are reading this, I love you. Keep on keeping on.",

I often have problems with one of our departments but today was the worst yet and I asked my supervisor to pull the call.\n\nFirst he asks the member's ID which I start off and he shouts \"No no no wait a minute!\" Then goes to clarify, even though the options he laid out are either the alpha-numeric beginning our clients start with and then one we don't have ANY clients that start off that way. I finally get through that portion and he asks for the member's name. The member's last name is a Latino name. He then cuts me off again to ask \"Do they speak English?\" Dude, first don't you think I would have warned you about this before taking on this call? Second, wouldn't I have already had an interpreter on the line as a courtesy per company policy? Third, why are you treating your coworker like  this?",

        "text": "  This is from a time when I answered for a rental/construction company in Niagra Falls, New York. The name of the company was rather vague, and the callers were always furious because they would have problems for months on end and could never speak directly to anyone with the office as the lines were always forwarded to the answering service. This is probably the worst phone call that I have had for this particular company.\n\nThis woman rented a home for her and her children in the early fall. About two weeks after she moved in, a major sewage backup occurred in the basement, leaving it three feet deep in raw sewage. The problem was due to a combination of a botched fix on behalf of the rental company and heavy rains in the area. The rental company was at an obligation to fix it. Her conversation with me was in January.\n\nFor a little over three months there had been over a foot of water in the basement. Nothing that was in the basement could be salvaged. The basement walls were coated in black mold. If you opened the door to the home you were choked with mold spores. The mold was growing on her furniture. It was in her photos. It was throughout anything that had been left in the home since she abandoned it in October. She had to pull her children out of school for a semester due to her move and instability of a permanent residence. She was also still being charged rent on this property that was 100% unlivable.\n\nShe spoke with me for about 30 minutes. Apparently she went to the office multiple times in person and no one was there. She had personal phone numbers for three of the employees. One of the numbers connected directly to the answering service, one was shut off, and the other would ring endlessly with no voicemail. At the time of her phone call she was in talks with an attorney and the Empire State Board of Health and Human Services, because not only was she still being charged rent, they were taking her to court for nonpayment dating back to October, when she reported the issue.\n\nI have no idea what happened after her phone call with me. Throughout the entire call I was very sympathetic with her, and agreed that the management sounded like a group of inept pricks, and more or less put her opinion in the ticket that I created. It was worded in such a way to make it look like I agreed with her, but was also vague enough to make it look like I was just writing down a summary of what she told me. This was a four-paragraph ticket that I made for them. Shortly after this, the company placed a limit on our service tickets of five words.\n\nThis was the most extreme phone call I had dealing with this company, but the gist was all the same. They would look great and be attentive and almost overly caring until you signed a lease and moved in. After that you were on your own. They were there to collect rent payment and if you have a problem good luck.\n\nThe really screwed up part: I checked while writing this. The company still exists somehow. I am considering copy-pasting this to a google review of them, but I am not sure of the legality. Wish that I could remember this woman’s name so I could look up how her court case turned out. If anyone reading this lives in the Niagra Falls area, beware of this shitty company. I don’t know how they are still in business because this phone call was four years ago, nearly five, and every single call every day was some sort of issue like this that was not being resolved. ",

        "text": "For a long time I worked for an answering service that answered for a “.com” business that offered free shipping on certain orders from certain websites. It was an initial 30-day trial from the point of sign-up, which would be done as an add-on to an order you are placing through popular shopping websites. After the trial period ended, you would then be billed X amount of money (ranging from $10 up to $16 per month) until you call in to cancel your membership. Most often people would sign up without realizing it, enter that they agree to terms and conditions without reading them, and then would call pissed because they are being billed for something that they “didn’t buy.”\n\nWe had a few keywords that would automatically escalate a cancellation to potential refunds. These included, but were not limited to, I didn’t authorize this, I will report this to the better business bureau, I will report this to the attorney general, and a few others. Most of the time this didn’t even come up, but once in a great while I would have someone list several in the first sentence speaking with me. This actually streamlined the calls very efficiently, and I would end the call quickly with all parties relatively happy.\n\nThis is not a normal call.\n\nThis strange woman called and reached me, and was very pleasant through the entire call. It just left me feeling weird afterwards.\n\nCaller: Hello, I was just wondering what this charge is on my banking statement, I don’t recognize this company.\n\nMe: You’ve reached the .com business! I am with their customer service department. We are a business designed to help you save money on shipping costs through XYZ shopping websites.\n\nCaller: Oh… I don’t remember signing up for this.\n\nMe: Probably what happened is you placed an order through XYZ website, and at checkout you were prompted to sign up for a 30-day trial of our website. You were billed because the thirty day trial ended…. It looks like 21 days ago. We will be billing for your next monthly cycle in 9 days. It doesn’t look like you have used our service since signing up. How can I help you today?\n\nRight here is where most callers lose their shit. They start cursing at me, demanding they get their money back for all of the months that they have been billed, they never agreed to this, let me speak to your manager, the whole show. This lady is calm, and it catches me completely off-guard.\n\nCaller: Oh, that thing… I think I remember signing up for that. How do I benefit from it?\n\nNo one has ever asked me this before, and at this point I had taken calls for this client for about one year. I had a moment of total shocked silence before I started to explain it to her.\n\nMe: …Well, our function is to help with orders over $20, covering shipping costs for you through popular sites. Do you order frequently from South American Jungle, from Auction, or from Toomuchstock?\n\nCaller: Oh, maybe a few times a month, I don’t do a lot of online shopping, and most of my orders already qualify for free shipping.\n\nMe: I understand, ma’am, just so you know you are under no obligation to remain a member and can cancel at any time. Well, I am here to help you, is there anything I could do for you at this time?\n\nCaller: No, not right now. You said I get billed in 9 days, how much will that be for?\n\nShocked. Who is this woman, and why is she so okay with me taking her money?\n\nMe: …Your billing will be for our full membership fee, that will be $12.95. Again, this is a monthly recurring membership.\n\nCaller: I completely understand. Thank you for your time.\n\nMe: Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nCaller: No, thank you. Have a good day.\n\nShe hung up. I watched her membership for the next six months. She never called through that entire time, and the only notes in the account reflected my phone call. Nearly nine months after she spoke with me though, she apparently called back and was the stereotypical caller hitting every nail on the head with what to say. But I noted that my fellow agent had to escalate to a manager, who took the time to review the recording of my call with her. I didn’t get to hear the manager speaking with her, but the notes made it very clear, I explained exactly who we are and what we do, and the nature of our business, and that if she wanted to cancel her membership that was fine, but she was not eligible for any sort of refund due to her previous phone call. Her membership was cancelled at that time, and she was never given back any of the money we had billed her, which was a little over $100.\n\nThis account was plain weird sometimes. I think people would enter false information with a real credit card number to get free shipping on an order that already had free shipping. We had a couple hundred accounts for Jesus Christ, one for IP Freelee, one for a woman going by Mama Juggs, and one for some guy named Joe that apparently had a rather extreme foot fetish. If I can remember any of these more fully they may get their own story eventually.",

        "text": "I work for an energy company, and am the first point of contact for most of the customers that ring in. A call came in today, and there was a woman on the line, speaking in that careful voice that tells you someone else is being discussed, and that they're listening in.\n\n\nShe explained to me that she was from a social housing place- these tend to be clusters of flats or bungalows, with a small staff of people who help their elderly or special needs residents stay independent. She herself was a named person on this account and normally dealt with it for Richard, but that today he wanted to try and do it himself. I asked, careful as her, if Richard was the kind of person who maybe didn't have much confidence in speaking on the phone, and would need to take it slow? She said yes, clearly relieved that I'd understood straight off what I needed to do.\n\n\nRichard himself came on the line, and we went through security together. He was a man in his 50s, with the sort of booming, halting voice people with learning difficulties sometimes have. He asked me some questions about what my job was, and where I lived and whether I had any cats, and were they big cats or small cats. I told him I had one of each but that the small one bullies the big one, and it made him honk with laughter. After he'd talked off his nervousness a bit, I asked him if he had any questions about his bill.\n\n\nHe didn't really, because he didn't understand the bill in the first place. So I told him I would be his teacher today, and he could ask me whatever he liked about his electricity. At this point I knew my CHT was buggered, but I'm pretty quick on calls so I'll make it up elsewhere.\n\n\nHe asked me all sorts of things about where the electricity is made and how it gets to his house. How much it was and how he can pay, and how I found out how much he's used. So then we get on to how electricity meters work, and he went to his meter and asked me how he could read it. I have to admit he faltered on this last bit and sounded quite disheartened, so I told him that he could read it himself but when the meter reader goes to his neighbour he'll check his too, just to make doubly sure his reading is right. (I added a note to his account, explaining that he might call in with meter reads, but not to enter them onto the system if they were out of line)\n\n\nWe were on speaker, so the woman who called in could hear what was going on, and it was lovely to hear her say from time to time 'That's good Richard' and 'It's ok Richard, the lady said you can ask what you like'. I spent 40 very enjoyable minutes on the phone and I don't know whether he'll retain any of the information I gave him. His helper told me from the background that he likes getting post, so I've sent out whatever brochures and guides are available, anything really. But at least he knows he can ring big companies now, and there'll be a friendly person on the line to help him.\n\n\n\nEDIT- Thanks for all the lovely comments everyone, and the gold. It's important to give people with learning disabilities the confidence to deal with their own business if they want to, and are capable of it, and I'm glad I seem to be taking the right approach.",

        "text": "Hello all, first time long time!\n\nI wanted to share a customer encounter that's stuck in my head for over a day, and ill probably never forget! Its been a busy week with the launch of the new iphone, hurricanes and such, so hold times are high. Most are agitated by the wait but I always acknowledge the wait and alone calms people down and its business as usual. Not this guy...\n\nMe: \"I appreciate your patience waiting to speak to me today, how can I help.\"\n\nCust: \"I cant believe this, making a customer wait like this should be criminal, and I don't appreciate being treated as a criminal!\"Me: \"I apologize for the wait, you have me now, I have your number and will be sure to call you if we get disconnected.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point im looking in the notes and hes just called back after failing text authentication with another rep. Rep states \"very rude and upset.\" Ok well nothing I cant handle. Next the customer goes into a long spiel about how awful our company is not allowing him to suspend a line because his phone is lost, that the other rep treated him like a criminal because he did not know is account PIN and that the rep could not show him how to check text messages for the secondary verification on his phone. At this point his acct is locked from to many secondary text message attempts for 24 hours, so I decide to help him out via email.\n\nMe: \"Im sorry the previous rep could not assist you, I do have the emulator for your phone pulled up so I can help you with any questions about checking messages, but at this point we will need to try a different way to access your account since we are locked out of text messaging route for 24 hours.\"\n\nCust: \"WHAT!!! YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE PREVIOUS COULD HAVE TOLD ME HOW TO CHECK MY MESSAGING, THIS IS CRIMINAL.\" (keeps using that word for some reason)\n\nNow im sure he tried to help the guy press the BIG button on his basic phone labeled MESSAGES, so im not going to apologize for the previous rep at this point as I am getting annoyed at this guys attitude.\n\nMe: \"Ok so I know you waited a long time to speak to me so I don't want to keep you waiting all day. I'm going to send you a verification email to [Address@adress.com](mailto:Address@adress.com) \\- Is that a good email for you?\n\nCust: \" What? Yes that's my email, why didn't the previous rep do this?\"\n\nHe goes on for another minute about how unhelpful we are and how long this is taking, filibustering at this point. So i interrupt and apologize again and give him some instructions. Made sure to outline how this is going to work, because once I send the verification email, it will expire after a few minutes! So he has his email up and this exchange happens....\n\nMe: \"Ok I have sent you the verification email. We need to open it and complete verification.\"\n\nCust: \"Oh, well I have me email open and no new mail, there is just the number 1 next to the word Inbox.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh ok, sounds like we need to refresh your screen, either click on the word inbox, sign out and back in, or press F5 on the top-\"\n\nCustomer interrupts me at this point...\n\nCust: \\*speaks some Japanese\\*Me: ... ok what do you see, did the page refresh?Cust: \\*speaks Japanese again and calmly says\\* Do you speak Japanese?Me: \"no sir. Do you see the email because its about to expir-\" He cuts me off againCust: \\*Japanese intensifies\\* dO yOu SpEaK jApAnEsE?\n\nMe: \"no sir.\"Cust: \"THAN WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR TELLING ME TO DO JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO\"\n\nIm literally screaming internally, is this real life?\n\nMe: \"Can you reload your email sir?\"\n\nCust: \"WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?!?!\"\n\nMe: \"Can you close your browser and re-open your email?\"\n\nCust: \\*speaks Japanese again\\* WHY DO YOU EXPECT ME TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IM 80 YEARS OLD!\"Me: \"In the upper right corner there is a red X, this closes the browser window, click that then re-open your email like you normally do.\"\n\nAt This point we've finally got the new email displaying in his inbox, he struggles to open the email and then asks what to do next.\n\nCust: \"It says to complete authentication, click below? WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO CLICK THERE IS NOTHING THERE!?\"\n\nMe: \"Ok is there anything below the \"click below\"?\n\nCust: \"Just a red button that says complete authentication and something about if you received this email in error to contact us.\"\n\nIm loosing my patience with this guy and then it happens. On my screen I get an \"Authentication request timed out.\" At this point we cannot help the customer with his account unless he goes into the store, as we have exceeded the numbers of email authentication also. I explain this to him and he goes on a big tie-raid again about how awful we are and how unhelpful we are, hes going to write a letter to corporate and that hes an author and hes \"very smart\" and how were treating him like a criminal yadda, yadda. At this point IDGAF because I've been nothing but courteous and professional. He goes on and on some more and decides to go to the store to get it sorted. But boy oh boy did I want to treat this guy like a baby. You mad because you don't know how to work a cellphone or pc and its our fault. No, I don't speak JaPaNeSe and next time CLICK THE WIDDLE WED BUTTON IN THE UPPER WEFT OF DA WINDOW TO CWOSE DA WINDOW AND OPEN YOUR WEMAIL AGAIN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The last line is baby talk, not mocking of a Japanese accent. In fact, my customer did not have any accent. Sounded just like an older grumpus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "So a while back I worked in credit card activations, basically people would call in to activate their credit cards and, because heaven forbid the bank passes up a chance to make some money, part of my job was also to sell credit card insurance. Because clients were calling in to do this one thing and then get ambushed by a product pitch some of them got really, um, let's say *upset*.\n\nWay back when I was in training for this job, the agent trainer gave us specific instructions on what to do when a client is losing their shit. There was a line in the script for just that occasion, to be used only when absolutely necessary: \"Due to the nature of this call, I'm going to have to end it.\" The other agents and I were instructed to hang up on the client after using the line, it was basically our nuclear option. If someone if yelling/swearing their head off, you use the line and cut off the call.\n\nThat's it for the need to know background information, on to the tale. Client calls in, she seems calm and I'm under the impression that everything is fine too try to sell to her. I get her information, as I'm activating the card I start the product pitch. I'm bearly two sentences in the client cuts me off.\n\nClient: SERIOUSLY?? You're going to do this?\n\nMe: ma'am it's a part of the process, you're free to say no to the insurance if you don't want it.\n\nClient: Fucking hell, of course I'm going to say no. Why the hell did you even try to sell it to me?\n\nMe: The insurance is offered to all eligible clients, as I said before your free to say no if you don't want it.\n\nClient: Holy shit, fuck [bank name] I can't believe they'd waste my time over nothing. Why the hell do you do this for a living? Don't you have anything better to do, you sack of shit?\n\nMe, just about done with this call: I'm sorry ma'am but due to the nature of this call I'm going to have to end it. *click*\n\nIn a sane world that would be the end of it, I had activated the clients card, she didn't get the insurance she was so pissed off over, she really had no reason to call again. But apparently, this dumbass lady never thought to check her online banking to see if her card was active and because of the way the call ended she thought I didn't do it. Thus, she called again. The way our call centers system is set up is so that if a client calls back immediately after their call ends, they will actually be directed to the same agent they were speaking to before. The logic here is that if a call ever gets cut off and the client calls back they don't have to explain their situation to a new agent and they can just pick up where they left of from the first call. In practice though, what usually ends up happening is that the asshats get directed back to the agent who hung up on them and this time they're even more pissed then before.\n\nMe: *does introduction stuff, client actually doesn't recognize me and thinks shes talking to another agent*\n\nClient: hey I already called a minute ago and I need you to tell me if my card got active? The cunt I was taking to before hung up on me.\n\nMe: ... Excuse me?\n\nClient: she hung up on me, the bitch. Anyway just tell me if my card is active.\n\nMe: ma'am, I'm the same agent you were taking to before, and I don't think I can continue this call. *Click*\n\nA couple of minutes pass by and I get another call coming in. Guess who it was?\n\nMe: *introduction stuff, ask for clients information*\n\nClient: oh hi, I think you were the agent I spoke to before? \n\nMe: are you [Clients name]?\n\nClient: yeah, I am. Did you activate my card?\n\nMe: I actually activated your card during our first call, but I hung up on you because I do not appreciate being insulted. I understand it's a little frustrating to have your time wasted by a product pitch, but I am just doing my job as I was trained to. \n\nClient: Your right, I'm sorry you were just doing your job. So my card if active now?\n\nMe: yes, it's ready to use now. Thank you for choosing [bank name] and have a nice day.\n\nYup, she actually said she was sorry to me. I strongly suspect she only did so because she was afraid of me hanging up again, but even so I'll take it. Hopefully this lady learned a valuable lesson about how to treat customer service people, and if not... Well, I hope this story entertained you at least.",

        "text": "I worked at a 3rd party cell phone call center. We were supposed to troubleshoot customer problems, assist with finding the correct cell phone plan, and assist people with upgrading their phones. \n\nIn reality, we got yelled at for 8 hours a day, because of fees, and damaged cell phones outside of warranty, and everything under the sun. These are my 3 favorite stories. \n\n1) I had a customer call in, and he wanted me to block the entire state of Maryland from calling his phone. \n\nI advised him that, at the time, he could block up to 5 numbers from his phone, or we could add on a pay-service for xxx amount and block 20 numbers. \n\nThat wasn't good enough. It had to be the entire state of Maryland. His ex-bae could borrow someone else's phone, or find a pay phone, or SOMETHING, so it had to be the entire state. \n\nI told him the only thing I could do would be to change his number, but that wouldn't work. He liked his number. It was easy to remember. No, I just needed to block Maryland entirely. \n\n2) I had a customer that purchased a wifi hot-spot. It was basically a little add on device that would allow you to create your own wifi area when connected with your laptop. (This was years ago). \n\nHe took his little toy to Jamaica. I don't know what the rate is now, but at the time, it was something like $25.00 per megabyte of data usage. \n\nHis bill for the month was somewhere in the vicinity of $16,000. \n\n\n3) A customer called in, wanting to know why we wouldn't allow him to receive his upgrade. His contract was up, and he was due an upgrade, and the associate at the store he was at claimed that he wasn't eligible. \n\nI looked at his account, and he was almost $1000 behind on payments. I explained to him that, while his contract was up, and he was technically eligible for an upgrade, he hadn't paid his bill in full for almost a year, and hadn't made a payment at all in almost 4 months. Until we're received the past due amount on his acct., we weren't going to be allowing him an upgrade to a new $600+ phone. \n\nHe was livid. He demanded an upgrade. I put him on hold and spoke with a supervisor, who agreed with me, that he wasn't getting an upgrade. This supervisor then went to lunch and left the building. \n\nI got back on the phone and explained that my supervisor had agreed that he wasn't getting an upgrade. He wanted to speak to that supervisor, who had gone on lunch. I flagged down a second supervisor, explained the situation to her, she got on the line and agreed to EVERYTHING, and handed me back the headset and told me to handle it. \n\nHe was super smug, and rude, and used tons of profanity, and ordered me to do my *$(#*#)$ job and order his $)#*$#)$( phone. Then he hung up. \n\nPolicy was that any changes to the acct. had to be made with the customer on the line. I returned everything back the way it originally was, noted everything, spoke with the Head Supervisor about the situation. He said he'd call the customer back the next day, and not to worry about it. \n\nHe didn't get his upgrade.\n\n",

I'm basically the last person you can have any interaction with before consulting with an attorney.

We couldn't hire new people fast enough, and eventually ran out of space to put them. We normally make outbound calls to people within a few days of receiving their complaint, but being severely understaffed, we're months behind at this point and are just now calling people that made complaints in June. Everyone is working their ass off with 12 hour days just to keep from getting behind any farther than this.\n\nRecently, someone on my team called up an older customer who had made a complaint in June and were still waiting for a resolution. Only to be told by the person who answered the phone, \"sorry, they just passed away last month\". We're so far behind, that the customer had literally died in-between making the complaint and us getting around to calling them. It's been the running joke in the office for a few weeks.",

I had just learned a new line of calls, Level 2 agent now. We take credit card apps for various small banks, and now, business cards.   \n\nForeign guy calls in, impatient at the get go. Keep in mind, we have to ask all the questions verbatim, and read disclosures. I mean, they need to know what they're signing up for, right?   \n\nAfter standard greeting, I ask for his confirmation number: the number attached to a customer's offer. He gives me it, and I can't find it. He tells me it expired it January, so about 8 months ago. I tell him I can look it up using his name and zip code, and he gives it. Again, no go. Luckily with this particular card, we can offer a generic card. I pull it up, and now it gets fun.   \n\nI read the disclosures about the card (we have to read it all before they can apply.) First question is about if they are able to speak on behalf of the business. He impatiently says \"yes yes yes yes!!\"   \n\nOk... So next up is asking what percentage of their business they own.  \n\n\"I told you I own it! God, you don't know anything, you don't listen!!\"   \n\nAlready I'm fuming and start speaking through gritted teeth the rest of the call.  He talked quietly  when he said it, but loud enough for me to hear.   \n\nI ask the questions in order, verbatim, and ask the name of the business, as per the next question. Although he said it before, we still have to ask.  Again, more pissiness. A few questions later, I ask how he would like the name to appear on the card... \"I told you already!! *enunciates name like I'm stupid*  \n\nThrough gritted teeth, I thank him. Oh, and throughout the call he calls me \"sir\". Ok asshole, I'm a female with a high voice, theres no way I sound like a dude.  \n\nClearly the call is already fucked.  I ask him for his tax ID for the business, and he tells me he's in traffic.  \n\n\"Hold on hold on hold on, I'm in traffic, I have to pull over to get it.\" Seriously?? Doing business in traffic??  \"Hold on hold on hold on!\"\n\n5 or so minutes later he gets it, as I'm hearing honking in the background.  \n\nFinally, the finally disclosures, ask if he agrees, and another \"yes sir\".  At this point I'm fed up, shaking, and tell him \"I'm not a sir!!\"  \n\nA few more back and forth and call ends, as I take a much needed break.  Seriously!! Fuck that dude.",

There had been no roof work done since 1990. There was black mold throughout the structure. There was a bee hive of killer bees running the full length of the attic. The main floor had a severe bedbug and termite infestation. There was asbestos in the structure. On top of all this, the foundation was uneven because the bayou had started to grow, and the house was sinking into the swamp.\n\nI maintained my best customer service demeanor, but I seriously considered giving the caller advice on how to commit insurance fraud.",

I pulled up his account and the account of the person who referred him to check. Now, our system is smart enough to detect fraud specially if the registered phone number or email is the same.

This guy was having difficulty with a fairly common occurrence for hotels. All names, dates, numbers listed below are obviously changed.\n\n\n\nMe: Hello, how can I help you?\n\n\n\nCaller: This card keeps declining. Why??\n\n\n\nCool, no account info or card number, I should just already know what the hell he’s referring to, I guess?\n\n\n\nMe: I’ll take a look at that for you, I just need some information first. (He gives me what I need.) Okay, I show that we cancelled this reservation.\n\n\n\nC: What? Why would you do that?\n\n\n\nMe: Why would we cancel? Looks like the guest had a change of plans. We reserved it on the 5th for arrival on the 7th, and on the 6th the guest had us cancel it. We called your property and spoke to Jane and she gave us a cancellation number of CXL12345.\n\n\n\nC: But how can you just cancel like that?\n\n\n\nMe: Because.... we were asked to? We called you guys and no one said it would be a problem, and it was the day before the guest was supposed to arrive. As far as we’re concerned we’ve done our due diligence in notifying the property and getting approval to cancel so that card is not available to charge anymore. According to all the information we have here this was all in accordance with your cancellation policies. If something has changed, we need you to notify us first.\n\n\n\nC: Wow, that’s just not right. When you book a room at my hotel, you’ve booked it as far as I’m concerned. We sell out every night and we held this room!\n\n\n\nMe: So no one can change their mind, ever? That seems a little unfair. And as far as continuing to hold the room after we called to cancel, that sounds like something you should discuss with Jane.\n\n\n\nC: So from now on can I call the guest as soon as the room is reserved and get their credit card number to guarantee the room since your company won’t pay if they cancel????\n\n\n\nMe: ...No. If you start collecting credit card numbers from our mutual guests and charging them after they cancel within the timeframe that YOUR PROPERTY gave us to cancel, we’re going to have a problem.\n\n\n\nC: FINE! *hangs up*\n\n\n\nDefinitely left notes on that one and sent it to my supervisor. I have a feeling we’ll be hearing from him again, lol.",

Very suspicious.\n\nAnyways now to the good part. I will be Me and client will be C.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling major bank, this is Vulcannnnnn in Utah. What can I assist you with today?\n\nC: I just deposited $1140.00 in an ATM and it isn’t in my account.\n\nMe: I understand. Let me look into this for you. Give me just one moment please to get that claim started.\n\n(Now I had no intention of filing this claim, clearly a case of either customer fraud or someone had obtained enough info about this customer to call and file a claim. I grabbed account info and sent it to my supervisor to take a look at and possibly call account holder. I then added a note of my own in the contact history just echoing what 10 other associates had said. Then I get back on the phone and my life changed forever;)\n\nMe: So I was starting on that claim for you and it looks like there has already been one filed for that same amount and ATM a couple of hou-\n\nC: YOU KNOW WHAT, VULCANNNNN IN UTAH, FUCK YOU AND YOUR MAGIC UNDERWEAR.

I WILL CALL BACK.\n\n\\-Click- He hung up:)\n\nAt this point I am wheezing with laughter and send it to my supe to listen to the call. She gets a good laugh out of it as well.\n\nIn case some of you are not familiar, my state (Utah) is well known for its large LDS/“Mormon” population, (apparently not calling themselves “Mormon” anymore) and this individual assumed I was one of them. He didn’t know I had resigned from the church about 4 months ago and could not agree more that it is a cult. He thought he was insulting me and my religion.\n\nAnyways, I took the next call business as usual, blah blah blah, but that particular call still haunts me to this day. In a good way though, because I laugh whenever I think of it.\n\nAnyways, hope y’all have a great day!",

Expensive phones need a signature upon delivery and she was going to be out of town. Original order had her address since the agent who placed it was apparently having difficulty with our system finding her son's address.\n\nLittle extra info: I was working on a day off because of mandatory overtime so I already didn't want to deal with this shit. Not exact quotes, but you get the idea.\n\nMe = me of course\nWSUC = won't shut up customer\n\nMe: Thank you for calling large carrier, my name is D0nkeyTamer, may I have your first and last name please?\n\nWSUC: My name is WSUC and you I got an email saying my son's phone is going to be shipped! I won't be here!! You have to change it now!!\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear tha-\n\nWSUC: I NEED IT FIXED NOW I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T USE THIS ADDRESS INSTEAD!!! (she lists off some college campus with a non-standard address)\n\nHad the account populated pre-verified, I'd have been ready to copy down the corrected address down.\n\nMe: Let me se-\n\nWSUC: AMAZON DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM DELIVERING TO THIS ADDRESS WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS TAKE THIS ADDRESS??! I WON'T BE HERE!!!\n\nShe goes on this loop for a good 5 minutes until I get fed up looking at the validation screen since I need her pin to even do anything.\n\nMe: Ma'am..ma'am! If you want me to help you I'm going to need your pin to even see what's going on with your account.\n\nWSUC: My pin is xxxx...Amazon finds my son's address just fine what's the problem?!\n\nMe: (muted mic - This isn't Amazon you idiot) Your account is loading, let me pull up the order. What type or phone did you order?\n\nWSUC: Can't you see it?!\n\nSorry our systems are slow AF and your account was literally loading in. You could not be a donkey and answer the damn question.\n\nMe: I'm waiting for your account to load in and I'm asking because I need to know if it's a preorder or just a regular upgrade.\n\nWSUC:  What's that? I don't know what that means!\n\nSeriously...?\n\nMe: The new iPhones went on preorder recently and in order to make sure those get shipped on time, I'd need more info to further assist you.\n\nWSUC: It's some iPhone...XS I think? Oh geeze I don't know I need it delivered to my son I won't be here!!!\n\n\n\nAt this point she goes on about how I wouldn't be able to help her since a supervisor wasn't able to. Remarks show no sign of a sup, probably just another agent she was transferred to at some point.\n\nMe: Reviewing the order, I can get this resolved in a few minutes, I'll just need to fill out a ticket for you. If you don't mind, I'll need to place you on a brief hol-\n\nWSUC: UPS SUCKS WHY DO YOU GUYS USE THEM I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FEDEX UGH AMAZON NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY SON'S ADDRESS WHY DOES BIG CELL COMPANY HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS ADDRESS I WON'T BE OUT OF TOWN!!!!!!!!!\n\nGeeze lady, can you like STFU for 2 minutes and let the person working on their day off try to help? At this point I let bluntness slip in because the last place I want to be on a day off is at a call center dealing with this garbage.\n\nMe: I don't have any control of which carrier delivers your package. If you want me to help you, help me help you by giving me your son's address so I can fix this.\n\nWSUC: It's (insert address here) I won't be he-\n\nMe: I know, you said that multiple times already. I'll be right back shortly.\n\nBefore she could repeat the same thing for the 100th time, I put her on hold so I can actually work. Got the ticket submitted so the package goes to her son and tracking info said package wasn't shipped yet - right on time to ensure everything is good.\n\nAfter the hold, I guess she had time to realize how obnoxious she was being since her tone was less aggressive. Did the usual goodbye script and was surprised I didn't just hang up on her.\n\nAt my center, you can leave 59 mins early without pay at the expense of an absentee stat hit. Given it was my day off, forced overtime and my absentee stat is fine - I left after 2 hrs instead of the full 3. This lady tested my patience. Order your shit from Amazon next time, geeze.",

        "text": "I take calls for the equivalent of Onstar.\n\nTonight I got a call generated from a vehicle. No account came up - just the blank record of the vehicle in our system - which means the person on the line is not a paying customer and really should not be assisted in any way except perhaps to transfer them over to our roadside team.\n\nBut I'm *nice* so I try to help people anyway.\n\nA woman comes on the line and tells me she is renting this car and needs help. Of course, I'd be glad to help! What issue are you having?\n\n\"How do I start this thing?\"\n\nI ask for clarification, thinking perhaps she means 'set up services'.\n\nNo. She means 'how do I turn on this car.' I am... baffled. I can no more explain such a basic concept to a grown adult than I could explain 'how to sit down' or 'how to high five someone'. How do you respond to that without coming across as sarcastic?\n\nI explain that I am customer service for OnStar's cousin service, that I do not have access to a manual, and that the vehicle brand department that could assist her has left for the evening.\n\nShe asks if there is anyone there who can tell her how to start the car. Well, no ma'am. Truthfully it's that I don't know a single coworker who could explain it without laughing at her on a recorded line. I would suggest the manual.\n\nWhere's that?\n\n.... probably in the glovebox.\n\nShe doesn't even attempt to look and see if it's there. Just begins complaining that she was told by Car Rental Company that she could press the button in the car 24/7 for assistance.\n\nI explain that we are there to assist 24/7 for our subscribers but that we don't have a department here at 10pm EST who can access her manual and tell her how to start the car. Also, she's not a paying customer nor a potential one so she shouldn't be wasting my time (I didn't say that).\n\nShe asks again if there is anyone who can help, and why can't I tell her how. I explain I don't even have a way to know whether the vehicle she's in is a push to start or keyed start.\n\nWell, she says, I can see that. I could tell you that. Is that all you'd need to know to help me?\n\nAt this point I start to wonder if she's drunk. Because if you can see which one it is, why exactly do you need help? Either you turn the key, or you push the button. And considering the hour and her location (given by the car when she called), she isn't calling from the Rental Company parking lot. So she's already been driving the car.\n\nShe asks if I could bring a dealership on the line to help her, or transfer her to Car Rental Company. No ma'am. We are not in any way affiliated with CRC just because they happen to own our cars, so I cannot do an external transfer to them. You are welcome to call them yourself. And all the dealerships near her are closed.\n\nWell can't you find one that's open?\n\nNo ma'am, I will not cold call Brand dealerships on the other side of the country to have them explain how to start a car for you, even assuming I could find one that's open and didn't laugh and hang up.\n\nAt this point, after 8 minutes of trying not to scream, I offer our roadside center. I explicitly tell her they will likely not be able to assist either (because what the hell does she want explained?!). However, they may be able to get someone dispatched out to help her start the car.\n\nWell, how long will that take?\n\nProbably a while since it's 10pm and no tow company or dealer is going to prioritize a rental car driver who claims they don't know how to start the car. But my official answer is that I don't know, roadside can determine that. She agrees to the transfer.\n\nWhile attempting to bring roadside on the line, she drops the call on her end. As far as I can tell, she didn't call back.\n\nTen minutes of my life, wasted.",

        "text": " \n\nI work for a major cellular phone service, in their customer service call center.  Our company often outsources some of the work to third parties, but I am an actual employee of the company, so I deal with the phone accounts of other employees as well.  When my department started handling these calls I was somewhat happy, as I thought, “These are other people like me, they know what they are talking about.  I do not have to explain the basic things to them.”\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI will be M (for me) and there will be D (for dumbfuck)\n\nM: Thank you for calling, this is SuperReekon, can I have your name please?\n\nD: Is this employee accounts?\n\nM: Yes, I handle employee accounts.\n\nD:  Oh okay.  My name is Dumbfuck and I want to get my service turned back on.\n\nM: I can certainly help you with that, can I have your phone number?\n\n(Gives me the information, and I pull up his account.  This account is a mess.  According to it, he has been a customer for at least 6 years, and an employee for about 5 months.  He had a decent payment history up until his hire date).\n\nM: Sir, this account is disconnected for non payment.  It became suspended about a month ago, and you didn’t pay that bill for over a month.  So the company assumed you abandoned it, so it got disconnected and all your devices billed to the account.\n\nD: Yes, I know that.  I want to set an arrangement to get it turned back on.\n\nM: You cannot set an arrangement for this.  You need to pay the past due balance of 1345.82 in order to restore service.\n\nD: 1300 dollars for a phone bill?!?  Are you (explitive)ing nuts?!\n\nM: Sir, we haven’t received payment in 4 months.  And the payment you made 4 months ago was not even the full amount so there was still a past due amount.  We are past the point of doing any kind of arrangement.  You need to pay this soon or the balance will be sold to a collection agency.\n\nD: There has to be something you can do.  I want to talk to financial services.\n\nM: Financial services sets payment arrangements.  They cannot help you.  Your services will not be restored until you pay at least the past due of 1300.  \n\n(at this point he goes crazy.  Downright SCREAMING about this.  While he is going, I turn the volume on my phone down and I look him up on our internal directory so I can see his position within the company.  My jaw hit the floor.  He was another customer service agent.  He handles the same exact call volume that I do.  I also saw his schedule.  He was scheduled to be working right now too.  He was logged in to our internal chat service and was calling from his center.  Once he was done, I hit “refresh” on his account and notice there was an alert added that his balance had been sold to a creditor while he was yelling.  So even if he had his 1300, he would have to take it through them.)\n\nM: Well sir, it appears that your account has now been sold to a creditor, and I am unable to assist you any further.  Their number is XXX-XXX-XXXX\n\nD: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  \n\nM: I am also letting you know that now that you have fully defaulted on your account you will no longer be eligible for your employee discount, as you have violated the terms of it by not paying your bill, and by using profanity against me.\n\nD: (Profanity x100000)\n\nM: And I will also be emailing your supervisor so she can review this call, and you can get some much needed coaching on how the billing for accounts works.  I will now transfer you to the creditor.\n\n(I then cold transferred him to the creditor.)\n\nI have had many calls before where someone uses profanity against me. That is fine.  When it is another employee, who has the SAME DAMN JOB AS ME, who should also know better, yeah I have a problem with that.  It also says in the terms of the program and the employee handbook that acting that way towards another employee is grounds for termination.  ",

Anyways, here’s some background. we deal a lot with customers calling in because they’ve cancelled a recurring payment with a merchant, but the merchant didn’t get the memo, whether by accident or not. So we file a(non fraud)dispute and send it to the research team. \n\nI’m very confident on the phone and I know what I am talking about. This man calls in, had a recurring billing set up with a merchant. Wants to file a claim all the way back since November of last year. I explain to him the 90 day timeframe we have, takes a little bit of time, but he’s okay with it and understands. I get started on the dispute. Now this is where it gets good. I am “M”,   the male client will be “C”,    and his bitchy wife will be “W”.  \n\n\n\nM: I am just getting started on that claim. I do need to confirm i have the correct mailing address. Is your address 1234 Sim City, Antarctica, 69696??   \n\nC: Yes, perfect. We just started driving to the airport, is it okay if I pass the phone to my wife?? She’s on the account as well. \n\nM: Yes, that would be great. Go right ahead. \n\nW: Hello? \n\nM: Yes, thank you for calling -major bank- , this call is monitored and recorded. My name is M and I am located in the jungle. I was just working on the dispute for -random merchant-.  I was just telling your husband that I can only file non fraud up to 90 days previous. \n\nW: Excuse me??!! \n\nM: -explains timeframes and policies, blah blah blah-\n\nW: That is unacceptable. Get me someone who can file all the way back. \n\n-back and forth for a bit, I am skilled in de-escalation-\n\nM: -I finally have had enough- Okay, there is one way we can file all the way back but I will have to file fraud and block the debit card those charges were associated with. \n\nW: That’s fine. Just shut up and do it. \n\nM: -I put the bitch on hold and file the claim, block the card, actually happened to be her debit card- Okay i’m done. Thank you for holding. \n\nW: Anything else? \n\nM: Nope, just confirming I blocked that card ending in 6969. \n\nW: EXCUSE ME?!?!?!?!\n\nM: Yes, I had to file a fraud claim in order to be able to go back all the way. I am required to block the card. I filed that claim and blocked the card. Glad to help you today, have a great trip!\n\nW: Get me your manager. Now!\n\nM: Absolutely! -warm transfer to next available supervisor, let them know what happened and that I was adding a note in the claim for the research team too. I then sent the customer over to the supervisor. This supe has a reputation for zero tolerance for bullshit. I knew this bitchy customer would be in good hands ;)\n\nI then wrote a lengthy note in the claim detailing exactly what happened and how it was non fraud but she insisted I file fraud. Claim will be denied. Card has been blocked. And right before a trip out of country too. No regrets. \n\nSupervisor who took the call later told me that he had listened to the call with the customer and he took care of any problems that the bitch was angry about. Good dude\n\nAnyways, lots more stories but now i’m gonna get drunk and celebrate the weekend. \n\n\nEDIT: I withheld the temporary credit as well because she was a bitch. I realized later I could have approved the temp credit and told her that that was permanent and then imagined the look on her face when she had spent it all, the claim gets denied due to her being an absolute fucking tuna salad, and then that credit would be revoked. Oh well maybe next time I have some asshole like this. Happens all the time. ",

        "text": "Hi all! \n\nToday we have a quick little story about a person who was directed to us for help incorrectly. I never found out what happened, but I still feel bad about it. \n\nPart of what my company does is support a website that allows certain locations to file service work on fleet vehicles for reimbursement. We only support the site and the people who use it to file, we have nothing to do with the drivers because they’re taken care of by whomever they’re driving for. Usually. \n\nLast year a large “taxi” service came onto the program and all of their drivers were incorrectly referred to us for support. They all had OnStar in their cars, but if they needed roadside assistance, they’d call us thinking we could get them a tow truck, or they’d demand we set up a maintenance appt for them. Their company was such a mess that they were taken off in about six months, and a bunch of locations still never got properly paid for the work they did, but that’s another story. I always felt bad for the drivers because most were just confused, and we really couldn’t help them. \n\n\nMe = Me. Caller = The driver of the car. \n\n\nMe: “Customer Support, this is weneedthebitter.”\n\nCaller: “Hi, I’m a driver for *taxi service* and I’m having problems and need some help.”\n\nMe: (preparing for the spiel that I’d have to give to them) Sure, what can I help you with?”\n\nCaller: “Well, I woke up today, and my car’s not outside. It’s missing.”\n\nMe: “Your car that you drive for *taxi service* is gone? Was it there last night?”\n\nCaller: “Yes it was! You need to get me a new car, I need to work today!”\n\nMe: “Well, we unfortunately don’t assist with the drivers for your company, we help the locations that do maintenance on your car. I apologize for the confusion.”\n\nCaller: “So you can’t get me another car?”\n\nMe: “No, we cannot.”\n\nCaller: “So, who do I call to fix this then?”\n\nMe: “You should probably be calling the police, if the car was stolen, not us. And you should probably call *taxi company* and make them aware of what happened.”\n\nCaller: “Okay thank you, I’ll call them.” (Hangs up)\n\nI still don’t know how they stayed so calm, and we never found out what happened. Some drivers had their cars get repo’d if they stopped driving for the company and didn’t turn them in, or if they weren’t following the guidelines and the company decided to remove them from the programs. We never learned if this was one of those cases or if it was truly stolen, but that was an unexpected call, to say the least. ",

        "text": "This is another call center experience that I had, over a year ago now. At the time, the answering service I was working for focused heavily on medical accounts and we had to be sure to be HIPPAA compliant. That being said, my story is going to be more vague than I normally like being.\n\nAt this answering service, about 35-50% of our typical call volume was answering either after hours or as overflow for various mortuaries in the United States, with a heavy focus on the western United States. The typical call was something like this: Someone that has pre-purchased a cremation plan has died, and the caller is calling to request the mortuary remove the body. This is a sad fact that not many people realize for some reason, but a mortuary legally cannot pick up a body until after death has been declared by a person of authority. This authority can range from county coroner, local police or fire, a hospice worker, or a doctor overseeing the care of the newly deceased. The problem comes in when family is calling the number on the cremation plan thinking this is the only number they need to call. It’s extremely frustrating for everyone involved, especially when the person on the other end of the phone is in emotional distress.\n\nOne of the calls that were particularly memorable was a woman in Seattle. This call came in during the middle of winter, at the height of the rare and elusive Seattle Blizzard. I live in another major city in the northwest, and it has been snowing merry hell at my location for over seven hours, and conditions were even worse in the larger metro area of Seattle.\n\nCue my caller. We will call her Daughter. I had only started my shift about 90 minutes previously, and was unaware of any previous calls made by daughter. She is already very short by the time she reaches me, and expects me to know everything about her prior phone call.\n\nME: You have reached The Cremation Service, this is TheGingerRenaissance, how can I help you?\n\nDAUGHTER: I called earlier, my mother passed this afternoon and I was told that I need a hospice nurse to come out and talk to you guys. I have her here next to me, here she is.\n\nDaughter then unceremoniously hands the phone over to the hospice nurse.\n\nHOSPICE NURSE: Hello, I’m Hospice Nurse, I believe that I have all of the information you need.\n\nHospice Nurse and I have an uneventful conversation, even pleasant considering the circumstances. We get to the end of the call and I am wrapping up, when Daughter asks me if I could please get an ETA from the removal team. I’m more than happy to oblige, as it gives the family a rough idea of how much time they have for their final good-byes. I place my caller on hold, call the removal team, and let them know I still have the daughter on the line, who wants a rough ETA. The removal team advises me that they only have four trucks for removal services, and that all four are currently less than halfway through retrievals, and that one of the four was actually stuck in a snow bank. I’m told it will probably be at least three to four hours. I relay my apologies to the removal team, wish them an easier evening moving forward, and go back to Daughter.\n\nME: Thank you for waiting. I do apologize, our removal team has been very busy today, they are all currently assisting other families in the area, and one of our vehicles is actually stuck because of the storm. I’m so sorry for the inconvenience, but it is probably going to be a few hours before our team makes it to you.\n\nDAUGHTER: This is unacceptable! I’ve already been waiting for over three hours, since my first phone call! I thought someone was already on the way to me, and they were just waiting to hear from the nurse!\n\nME: Oh, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding. We can’t send out our removal team until we hear from someone of authority like the nurse. If we send out the removal team and no one has legally declared death, our removal team would have to leave without your mother, and you would probably be billed twice for removal.\n\nDAUGHTER: But I called earlier, the removal team should have been expecting my call and have people working in my area!\n\nME: I’m very sorry, Daughter, but these are definitely not normal circumstances. The blizzard has severely affected our ability to navigate through the city, and we are operating much slower than normal to ensure the safety of our team. Like I said, one of our vehicles is currently stuck in the snow.\n\nDAUGHTER: When I called earlier I was told it would be about two hours before anyone got here, and that was 90 minutes ago! I expect someone here in 30 minutes.\n\nME:  Like I said, Daughter, I am very sorry, but that is not going to happen. I have spoken directly to our removal dispatcher who has told me the time window I have told to you. This is the soonest we can make it out to you.\n\nDAUGHTER: You need to send out a different removal team then, I expect someone here in half an hour.\n\nME: We only use this removal team. I’m sorry, but you are just going to have to wait. The storm has gotten worse since your first phone call, and I hate to say it, but other families in need have called us that were ready for removal. We’ve sent our teams out to assist them, and the soonest team available will come to you. I will even ask them to give you a call when they are on the way to you so you know when to expect them. I’m very sorry, but other people have passed away in Seattle this evening, and we will come to you as soon as we can.\n\nThe hospice nurse cuts in at this point.\n\nHOSPICE NURSE: Oh wow. In all of my years of service I have never heard anyone so uncaring toward the family of a lost loved one. What is your name? I want to talk to your manager.\n\nME: I’m terribly sorry if you think I am being uncaring, I’m not. I’m truly sorry for the situation, and as I have said, this is not normal. We will do everything we can to assist you, but at this point my hands are tied and I am just trying to tell you why the situation is the way that it is. If you still want to speak with my supervisor I can see if they are available.\n\nHOSPICE NURSE: Yes, get them on the phone.\n\nSomewhat annoyed, I reach out to my supervisor and let her know what is going on. I explain the situation, and that Daughter had called earlier and was under the impression someone was already on the way to her. She rolled her eyes (this is a very common misunderstanding) and takes the call.\n\nSUPERVISOR: Thank you for holding, this is Supervisor…?\n\nThe next five minutes were a series of blinks, eyebrow raises, quizzical looks at me, and attempts to get a single word in. Apparently both the daughter and the hospice nurse took turns screaming at my supervisor, stating that I was excessively rude and that I was saying we just weren’t sending someone until after the storm. They also stated that the daughter had been promised a removal within three hours of her initial phone call (we NEVER promise an arrival time), and that they expected some sort of compensation for the additional wait time. My supervisor explained what I had stated already, that we normally offer an ETA of 90 minutes to three hours, but that due to the weather we were significantly slower than normal. She also stated that the business is first come, first serve, and that even though we received her call before other families that were being serviced, we are unable to send out a removal team until we are called by a person of authority.\n\nI guess the hospice nurse thought this was unacceptable behavior, and demanded we put her through to the funeral director. This does happen occasionally, when a family member is very angry about something or confused about what the pre-paid plan actually covers, but rarely is it to lodge a complaint about arrival times. We connected them with the funeral director. About twenty minutes later, the funeral director called the answering service back to speak with my supervisor about the call. Apparently they were very rude with her, and Daughter started cursing and threatening to cancel the cremation plan and take legal action. The funeral director, who had been running three directions at once since the beginning of the storm, decided she was having none of it. She tripled down on what we already said, and took it a step further. She advised them that if they wanted to cancel the cremation plan for partial return credit at this stage, it was perfectly okay. She would call off the removal team, issue a partial credit on the next business day through US Priority mail, and that Hospice Nurse and Daughter were welcome to call another funeral home and start this process all over, in effect causing further delays in the removal of the body. She advised that it was up to them, and that they needed to tell her RIGHT NOW so she could reach out to the removal team for the appropriate actions.\n\nI felt a little better about the situation after that. I stayed at that job for the better part of a year after that, but I ended up leaving due to a variety of reasons. That is a story in itself. But we never heard from Daughter or Hospice Nurse again. I guess someone finally came to pick up Mother, several hours after the initial phone call. I never found out for sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I had a previous post deleted for literally no reason. Not sure what happened there, but it did, and it annoys me.",

        "text": "Hey all, occasional poster in this sub, customer support rep for a software company that works with the automotive industry. Been in the business for about 2 years now, honestly love my job and the majority of the callers, except for the second person to ever make me cry in my time with this company. This is a long one, so buckle up. \n\nHere’s the situation, this user upgraded to a new software at the beginning of this month, and immediately had issues with it. Some of it was due to system requirements on their end, and some was on our company’s end, tier 2 reps got involved, all sorts of fun stuff. \n\nThe first time we talk to them, it was a 2 hour phone call between our male senior support rep and the male caller. Interaction stayed pleasant the entire time, he let our senior rep remote in, troubleshoot, got our tier 2 involved, and eventually some other stuff had to be done that I wasn’t around for, so the case had to be left open for a couple days. Fast forward to a day or so later, user calls back a couple times in that period, gets a female rep both times. Won’t let them talk or get with the tier 2 to see if there were any updates, demanded a supervisor as soon as he possibly could. We don’t get escalated calls too often, usually our callers are friendly enough, even if they’re having a rough day, so it was a shock to get someone this abrasive. Issue was fixed by day 3, they had a workaround solution in place until then, we thought things were done with this guy. \n\nCouple of weeks go by, and we get to this week. User calls back saying they cannot login to the program, and the person who takes that call is our tier two backup, who happens to be a female. On our direct team, she has the most experience with troubleshooting. this program, and was the best person he could have gotten, knowledge-wise. The caller tells her she needs to fix the issue, because well, they can’t use the program. She asks to remote in to clear out of his cache and temp files, he refuses and immediately asks for her supervisor. She advises that we need to do some stuff on our side to adjust their logins, but we still need to clear that temp data since the browser needs to be fully emptied after she makes those adjustments. He still won’t let her remote in and asks for her supervisor again. He tells her he already did that and there’s no point in us doing it. So, she obliged and does a temporary login expansion, twice. He still can’t login, and still refuses to clear his cache/temp files again, nor will he let her into the PC. \n\nHe then claims that even though they only pay for one subscription to the program, two users have “always” been able to login at the same time and use it, and he wants her to make it work like that again for him as well. Obviously, we feel what’s going on is probably related to that cached data, that he won’t let us delete. And even so, no users have been able to login with more than the agreed amount of subscriptions at once. If anything, we’ve had the opposite issue happen, but even so, anything is possible. Throughout all this he keeps asking for a supervisor, and our male team manager happened to be in a meeting. He advises he will wait on hold until he gets back, even though we have no idea when that will be. She places him on hold, he disconnects within a minute. \n\nShe throws a quick message into the group chat, letting us know of the situation in case we get a callback. Her case notes were fantastically detailed, but she wanted us to have advanced warning so we weren’t taken off guard. Well, I got the callback. \n\nMe = Me.    Him = That guy\n\nMe: “Customer Support, this is weneedthebitter.”\n\nHim: “Hi this is (gives name and account info) and I am calling back about an issue you all were looking at earlier but didn’t fix for me.” (He then describes the issue and mentions we ended the call from earlier, we didn’t.)\n\nMe: “Sure thing, let me just take a quick look at her notes from earlier today so I can see how to proceed from here. (Kills 30 seconds skimming her notes again, even though I read them after her initial chat message.) Alright, I see where we left off! Do you mind if I remote in there just to clear our your cache and temp data, and then we’ll get those subscriptions refreshed for you?”\n\nHim: “Transfer me to your supervisor.”\n\nMe: “I apologize, he’s currently in a meeting (he was, again. Worst damn timing) and I am not sure when he will be back. If you’d like I can remote in there and perform the troubleshooting, and I can also take down your direct contact information and have him reach back out to you as soon as his meeting is over.”\n\nHim: “No, I’m not an idiot. I know how to delete cookies. I already did that earlier today and I’m not having you come into my computer and do it again.”\n\nMe: “Sir, I apologize, I was not trying to imply you didn’t know how to do that, I just wanted to be able to verify for my troubleshooting/notes that those steps were completed.”\n\nHim: “I NEVER SAID YOU CALLED ME AN IDIOT I JUST SAID IM NOT STUPID.” (He goes 0-100 right here at the drop of a hat)\n\nMe: “Sir, I understand you’re frustrated, but I am trying to help. You are more than welcome to hold for my supervisor, but I am trying to come up with a solution to your problem so we can get you back up and running again. If you don’t let me do the troubleshooting steps they require me to do, then I can’t attempt to resolve the issue for you.”\n\nHim: “I don’t care, we can sit on hold all day. I’ve spent an hour on this today already (15-ish minutes on the first call) I can sit here all day and type and wait for him if I have to.”\n\nMe: “Sure thing Sir, I was just trying to find a more immediate solution to your problem that didn’t involve you having to wait. I was just trying to expedite the resolution process for you.”\n\nHim: “Well you can put me on hold and, wait, what’s your name again? (I say my name and he repeats it back to me.) Perfect. If you disconnect the call instead of putting me on hold, I’ll call back and this will be a big problem for you. Oh yeah, your product sucks and you and your support of it sucks. It’s useless and I don’t know why we even have it. So let me hold for your manager.”\n\nAt this point, I put him on hold for about 10 minutes, until my supervisor is back. All in all, the call was nearly 20 minutes long, and while I know I could have put him on hold sooner, I was hoping that if he really wanted his issue fixed, he would let me do my job to fix it, which is why I tried to reason with him. As soon as I put the call on hold, I started bawling. Also, I work remotely most of the time, so my colleagues were checking up on me via our group and private chats, and the pitchforks and torches were about to come out. \n\nMy supervisor gets back from his meeting, let’s me know he’s good to take the call. I compose myself and say in the cheeriest voice I can muster, “Sir, my manager is ready for you now, and I hope you have the best day ever!” My supervisor was done with that call very quickly, privately messages me to say thanks for handling such a difficult interaction. I advise that it should be conveyed to him that if he calls in for assistance, he has to let us do our jobs, he can’t just ask for a supervisor and expect it to get fixed, because our manager has no idea how to troubleshoot any of the products. My supervisor says that they will “coach him” on this whenever they talk to him next. (Because 3 requests for escalated calls from one person in a couple weeks was apparently okay to them.) He then goes on to put into our group chat that the customer decided to extend their subscription amount to resolve the login issue, that way they wouldn’t get the message saying they were past the available amount of logins for their location, and that this customer said we were “great” and “thanks for all we do”.\n\nMe (In the group chat); “If he said that, that’s hilarious, because he told me how much us and our company suck.” (Get a couple funny reactions from that, woohoo.)\n\nAt this point, I just hope I never have to speak with them again. And then I find out our manager was walking around telling our team how nice he was on the phone to him, and that as soon as the call got transferred to him the user was “suddenly” able to login. This is told to me by our male senior rep, who is my closest friend on the team. He immediately messages me and says, “something is wrong, I heard the first call today, well the female rep’s side of it, and you could tell he was being horrible to her.”\n\nSo, I go and look at all the previous cases for this guy. Out of all of them, he’s spoken with 8 of us, 5 males, 3 females. All of the males say he was pleasant or nice. All of the females have things like “rude”, “aggressive”, “yelled at me”, would not let me perform my duties”, “refused to let me try to troubleshoot”, etc. \n\nI type up as neutral of an email as I can muster to my supervisor and their boss, who is on very good terms with me and knows I don’t cry wolf. I cited the specific cases, interactions, remarks, etc and advised that we may be dealing with someone who is either sexist towards women, or at the least, hostile to females. I asked that if he call in again, one of them sit to listen in on the call, preferably my direct supervisor, since he’s spoken with the user before and he was “nice”. I summed it all up by saying we take our jobs seriously, and if we are not allowed to do our jobs, how can we help our customers and also maintain a positive work environment, when we have someone who is obviously hostile towards us.\n\nThey respond the next morning and thank me, and agree to sit and listen, should he call back in, because they felt a pattern was definitely emerging with him. Unsure of if they pulled the calls or not at that point, but I’m assuming they did. Fast forward to that evening, another email goes out. My supervisor took it upon himself to contact this user directly, and advised them that they were acting disrespectful and unprofessionally towards us, and if they call in anytime in the future, they have to be respectful and allow us to do our jobs. He also advised we can immediately transfer this caller to him, should he refuse to work with us. And if he is not available to take it and/or the user won’t leave a message, we can disconnect. To top it all off, he is notifying the users corporate reps of what is going on, and he can potentially get blacklisted if he does not follow the rules. (Insert me sighing in relief when I read that email here.)\n\nI may only talk to a few hundred people a week, but I’d say 98% of my interactions are overall very pleasant. At worst, someone is a little cranky or not comprehending of a program, and get frustrated, which is totally understandable. In a case like this where it wasn’t just a “bad day”, but a repeat issue in such a short period of time, it was amazing to see two bosses that had our backs. ",

Most of the time I can brush these types of calls off, but I felt myself having a panic attack right there. So what did I do? I didn’t get him anyone. I hung up on the moron. I just said “Fuck this” (in my head) and hung up. It was my last call of the night so its likely it may get pulled and I may get a coaching. But honestly it isn’t fair that employees have to take shit like that and have no backup for themselves or for other people. I hung up on him out of mostly fear, I was blinded by my racing heart and pounding head that I acted before I thought. \n\nLater in the night I guess he called again to redo the payment because he never told me yes to the payment. It was pretty awful, but the department I work in has the most entitled, bitchy customers. We have the thickest skin.",

        "text": "This literally just happened. I work for a luxury brand (only 1 day left yas) as a Sales and Services specialist. I'm highly trained for my brand. Not too often, but often enough, we get calls from reps of other companies such as banks or, as is the case here, concierge lines for credit cards. Normally, these interactions are the most pleasant because you can drop your customer service act a bit while still helping, but you get a little friendly banter. So I definitely wasn't expecting to get the call I just did. CC concierge line calls in, immediately the woman on the other end is short but pleasant enough to just ignore. I don't choose to engage beyond basics given her immediate attitude. They never received the tickets for their customer and need them resent. Easy enough. I verify the email with her. She corrects me on my pronunciation of concierge (using the 'proper' french pronunciation), whatever. Turns out the previous person who ordered these put in the wrong email so I have to change that. I do so, and while I'm typing the emaill (Ex: Concierge@majorcreditcardconciergeserv.com) she goes \"Do you know how to spell Concierge?\" I just stop for a beat and answer \"...Yes, but you can give me that if you want.\" Which of course she proceeds to do. The transactions continues with little input from me at this point until we disconnect. And Yes, I filed a report to the parent company who I happen to also be a customer of sooooo...\n\nLike what in the world? If it's some elitist shit there is no need. If we wanna pull that, I worked for a much bigger deal luxury brand than that but I ain't gonna pull that shit. So, just my PSA: Don't be a dick to other reps just because you can.",

You can read that post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/95wrua/the_peter_principle_shown_to_be_alive_and_well_at/). Not a dept. to outdo themselves, they've don't it again. This time they nearly ruined the bank. Enjoy.\n\nCast:\n\n&gt; **Ashley**: Customer\n\n&gt; **Bethany**: Colleague \n\n&gt; **ME**: Me\n\nAlso, amounts have been changed for anonymity and simplicity. Bethany has the power to stop accounts and issue a letter asking for evidence of funds. This will be important. With that, let's begin.\n\n---\n&gt; **ME**: Hello an welcome to [bank]. This is Peace. How may I be of assistance today?\n\n&gt;  **Ashley**: Well like, I sent some money to my friend, and she still hasn't got it yet. What's even up with that?\n\nSeriously, she talked like that. As though she was from California. Why? I did security and found out that Bethany was in System X reviewing the payment. So I rang through to her.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Hey Bethany. I'm just dealing with Ashley here about her payment. I can see you're currently working it. Can you please leave so I can see the necessary info?\n\n&gt; **Bethany**: Oh hey Peace. I was just about to call her to make the payment. I've exited the programme and removed stops from her account. Please do keep me updated if she wants the payment made. More than happy to do it. Saves you from ringing and joining the queue. \n\nI start to have a look at the payment. It was for £5,400 exactly. Alarm bells starting to ring. The customer was on state benefits. The largest payment she had was approx. £200.00 from the benefits system. A couple of days before this call she had been paid £5,500 from someone. Lets ask about that.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry for the wait there [Miss] Ashley. I see you're looking to pay £5,400. However, I can see you were paid £5,500 a few days ago. May I ask where that came from and what it was for?\n\n&gt; **Ashley**: Yeah, my friend sent me it. She did it by accident. I'm sending it back to her. She, said I could like, keep the £100. \n\nSee what we have here, is a Gen Y know-it-all who think it's easy to money launder. And that she has the best excuses.\n\n&gt; **ME:**: I'm sorry [Miss] Ashley. But what was the payment for? Did you say it was sent by accident? \n\nHere she started to get hella agitated. Frustrated and angry that the payment did not go through. I proceeded to tell her that she needs to visit any of our branches to get this paid. She began to get angry but I stood firm. Get. To. Branch. \n\nI then began to initiate the procedure for her account to get blocked via a report to the back office so that they could kickstart it. Only they can get that important letter sent. What I still don't understand is how Bethany, fucking Bethany! failed to notice this large amount come in to the account and didn't instantly keep the account blocked and send a letter requesting proof of funds. The only way she could have overlooked this is if she didn't investigate it at all. Y'know, didn't do her fucking job. \n\nHad this been anyone else, i.e. another advisor, this may have gone through. So basically, because fucking BETHANY! didn't do her job properly the bank may have funnelled through money that was most likely from criminal sources. Every time, it's always more senior, and more paid, colleagues that allow this kind of shit to take place. It's not always the customers that get me worked up; sometimes it's my colleagues. They're ridiculous.\n \nEDIT: grammar and typo fix.",

This is explicitly stated on our webpage.\n\nThe customer sent in their application for their property and made payment after being made aware we would carry out some validity checks upon acceptance. If we find that the information is incorrect, we reserve the right to cancel the job immediately. We couldn’t find his building during these checks, so we emailed him for a location. The following is the jist of the call made by him in reply: \n\n\nM: Good morning, M speaking, how can I help?\n\nC: I’ve received an email asking for the site location, but I can’t understand why. I already paid for the job.\n\nM: As mentioned on the website before you make payment, the application and subsequent quote need to be checked to ensure they are both accurate. One of those checks requires us to locate the site.\n\nC: It didn’t say anywhere that you’d need to check it for accuracy.\n\nM: You have to tick a box that states you understand we’ll carry our checks before you can move onto the payment.\n\nC: Ok, well the site is located between *building one* and *building two*.\n\nM: According to the mapping system, that building is a block of offices which are currently occupied?\n\nC: Yes, it’s an accountancy firm. I need you to carry out works at their office.\n\nM: The quote you received is for a residential property, as indicated by the website before you start your application. You have to click on ‘residential application’ to begin the process.\n\nC: I never said it was residential, I have always maintained it was an office block.\n\nM: You’ve manually selected house as the property type on the application?\n\nC: But you’ve given me a quote now and I accepted and paid so now you are bound to it.\n\nM: The box you ticked also linked you to our terms and conditions, also stating we reserve the right to cancel your application if the information provided is incorrect.\n\nC: This is bullshit. You can’t just cancel down my application because your website wasn’t functioning properly.\n\nM: The site is functioning fine - you have to manually tell the site which property type it is....it was written by you.\n\nC: Get me a manager now.\n\nSo I put him on mute, because something told me I was going to want to listen in to what he said while I was ‘away from the phone’.\n\nC: Fucking stupid dickhead.\n\n*Unmute*\n\nM: You provided false information on your application, don’t think you should be subject to the terms and conditions you agreed to and think we should just carry on while losing a significant sum of money, so don’t ever call me a fucking stupid dickhead again when I am trying to help you.\n\n*Line goes dead*\n\nHe called back later that day to speak to my manager, who cancelled his job there and then, arranged for the money to be returned and told him to never abuse his staff again.\n\nFuck that guy.",

And what I got was a 2 for 1 donkey show. Let's see...caller ID shown number for Telesales, where the customers number would be shows our 800 customer service number and the guy sounded confused AF. Basically this means this guy called Care, then transferred to Sales...then cold transferred to Transfer Your Service because reasons..?\n\nUh, this department is for moving numbers between our company and NOT in any form have anything to do with a customer talking moving to another carrier. We do have a customer loyalty team and this is not it! WTF r u doin? I talk to the customer more and after I explained all this, he starts getting mad swearing saying why we're shit.

        "text": "I spent five years working in an alarm monitoring call center from hell. You would call people at a number they provided, identify as the Alarm Company, and ask them for a verbal password they provided.  Many forgot the password, yet wanted FULL details of the alarm. When you would be firm that you couldn't provide information,  you know, given that you're calling about their SECURITY SYSTEM they would often say they \"don't like your tone\". Meanwhile, while they're not home the Grinch could be in their home taking all their presents. But now, let's talk about the security guys tone of voice instead. Often, you would try to get them off the phone and send police, because again, THEIR BURGLARY ALARM went off.  BUT NO! They want to talk about my tone of voice, being the guy that is proactively trying to monitor their home.  I think Girl Scouts of America would be better suited.\n\nThere is a special place in hell for people that would say \"I'm not giving you my password, how do I know you're my alarm company\". Great, oh yes, I'm an espionage Ninja that wants YOUR password so I can exploit the situation and steal your doilies and family photos! When you would say, no problem, call us back they would say ,\"wait, what happened\" and try to keep you on the phone. Um, back to that PASSWORD issue. Still refuse to give it and threaten to cancel their service. \n\nOthers acted like it was their constutional right to have a working alarm system. Some would cancel service,but call back down the road when their alarm panels beeped, outraged that as a non paying customer they can't be helped. \"Well you put this in my house\", \"it's your equipment\". Yes, me, the call center rep. I put that in your home.  That is like me calling Lowes because a sink purchased there twenty years ago in my apartment is leaking. \"Well you sold it to us\".\nThe calls were awful, the people I worked for were awful and I had a non stop party line of old people calling in because we did medical pendant alarms too! They would want to dispute a charge with the guy on the other end of \"I've fallen and I can't get up\". Many didn't even know they had a button and it would go off several times a day. Old people generally don't hear well and have their TV on full volume and were shocked they couldn't hear you over the LOUD speaker box in their home.\n\n\nSo, deep breath,  life on the outside!. After five years of hell, I went to HR one day and said, no more, quit on demand. The money was good, the hell was not. Since then, I have a salaried position working for a non-profit that treats me like a human being. Not a day passes that I don't give thanks that I'm not chained to a desk with someone screaming in my ear over an alarm. Don't settle for less people.  Take control.

        "text": "Apologies for the cheeky phone format. TLDR at the end. \n\nTo start with I work in a fraud department of a bank. I get a wide variety of calls mostly to do with fraudulent payments, and security check unblocks. That being said I have a variety of calls in between that can be relatively entertaining for my job role.\n\nOn this particular occasion I had a customer call through to myself about a payment that he wanted stopping. Which would be fine should the transaction be fraudulent. The conversation follows between the agitated fellow (AF) and myself (M) :\n\nM: hello you're through to M at mystery Bank, how can I help?\n\nAF: hiya there I should have 200 odd in my account but there's not because I need a payment stopping, can you sort this out please?\n\nM: sure I can certainly look into that for you, could I ask was this payment made by you?\n\nAF: no it weren't\n\nSo as usual we go through security to investigate the transaction and it shows as a pending transaction to a dating and escorts service for £45. At this point we're required to do some questioning to make sure it is actually fraud.\n\nM: okay so do you give authorisation to anybody else to use your debit card?\n\nAF: Yes\n\nM: okay, and who is that?\n\nAF: my friend\n\nM: aand when do you give him authorisation for your debit card?\n\nAF: all the time, whenever he wants or needs it...\n\nM: soo, could he have done this transaction?\n\nAF: Yes he did do it, he did it as a joke.\n\nM: Okaaay, you do realise this ISN'T fraud and we can't prevent that transaction from passing through onto your account then.\n\nAt this point my headset is beginning to radiate due to the rage coming from AF.\n\nAF: WELL WHY IT'S MY ACCOUNT I DON'T WANT THAT TRANSACTION TO GO THROUGH!\n\nM: I understand that, but because you have, in all technicality, authorised your friend to have full access to your card then we cannot amend any payment made by either yourself or your friend. The reason being is because this would be illegal to stop payments at a whim after services have been received.\n\nAF: so what I've lost £45 because of a joke?\n\nM:... Yes.\n\nAF: WELL, why can't you stop it? other banks can.\n\nM: No I'm afraid they can't.\n\nAF: So what am I supposed to do now?!\n\nM: Well we can potentially raise this as a domestic fraud case to get your money back, but that would be on the grounds of your friend being prosecuted for the fraud.\n\nAF: What, so get my mate locked up for a joke?\n\nSo at this point it is quite fortunate that I am a fraud advisor and I am required to be quite stern and abrupt when dealing with irate customers.\n\nM: I'm sorry but how is this a joke? You're not laughing and neither am I, so how is any of this a joke?\n\nAF: what? do you not have a laugh with your mates like?\n\nM: Yes, but certainly never by committing fraud on my account.\n\nAF: so are you going to stop this payment then?\n\nM: no, we're not and towards that I would certainly contact the police with regards to this. \n\nAF: fine! I'm going to go the bank and withdraw 200 pounds and switch banks!\n\nM: no you're not you'll be withdrawing £155...\n\nAF:... FUCK OFF!!!!\n\n*Click*\n\nNeedless to say, I felt pretty satisfied about that.\n\nTLDR: Customers \"friend\" made a payment likely to porn and wanted it stopped. I told him no so he switched banks in a huff. ",

I’m still within the one year warranty, so it’s covered.\n\nThis ended up with a huge argument about what was and wasn’t covered. I ended up having to send a technician anyway, to prove that it wasn’t covered. I felt so bad for that tech, but hopefully they got all my notes and knew what they were walking into!",

        "text": "Part of the company that I run the IT for is a small customer service call centre. Around 20-30 people, depending on the season.\n\nThe manager of this team has been here 20+ years, so you'd think she'd understand what's going on. Apparently not.\n\nOne of her team has recently been promoted to the \"technical advisor\" team, meaning he has access to a bunch of different stuff, his phone has new skillsets, and his job title has changed.\n\nThis has not changed the Manager's behaviour when filling out forms so IT can set up a new starter for her. There's a field where you can put in someone's name to mirror their permissions, rather than specifying everything you want individually. Saves them time, saves us in IT time. She always puts this guy's name in.\n\nFirst form, gets processed as per her request. The day after her new hire starts, we get ticket after ticket raised to change this newbie's access, his job title, phone skillsets etc. At every stage we explain to the manager why this has happened. \n\nTwo weeks later, another new starter. She's put in the same guy again. This time, I check. She's on holiday, so I ask her cover - she says \"just do it as submitted, she must have hired another Tech\".\n\nSurprise, surprise. It's wrong again. We go through the whole rigmarole of changing everything back to to a standard Customer Service Advisor. Again, explaining to her that this is what she asked for on the form.\n\nThis morning, she drops another form on my desk. Yep, same name to copy. I call after her to come back. She stomps around and shortly asks me \"what is it? Come on. I'm late for a meeting.\"  \n\"Do you really want us to mirror this guy *again*? Is your new starter a Customer Service Agent or a Technical Advisor?\"  \n\"Oh God, do I really have to change it? Is it that important? This has never been a problem before.\"  \n\"Other than the previous two times you've asked for this since Technical Guy got promoted?\"  \n\"I just don't understand why I have to change it *now*.\" She grabs a pen off my desk, scribbles out his name, and puts the name of one of her standard Customer Service Agents. Fine. \n\nI turn to put it in my In Tray, and when I turn back she's stormed off, still holding my pen.",

        "text": "Let's be real for a sec. While customers can be really annoying, most of the calls are pretty mundane. What annoys me more than rude customers are the idiots that represent the same company I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy primary role in my department is transferring phone numbers from one account to another. Secondary role is picking up the slack for customer care. The latter involves anything ranging from billing to kissing the ass of the most self entitled POS hoping I don't get a bad survey. Normally care calls are the usual fair of plan changes and why is my bill blah blah blah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've grown accustomed to these calls, but what infuriates me is when I'm just blindly tossed into a clusterfuck caused by another agent. It's one thing to have a customer call in and handling them, it's another when some donkey dumped them off. Usually our caller ID shows the national customer service 800 number so I typically know off hand that a customer is being transferred. Some cases, it looks like a legit customer number and those F me over so many times like today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's after lunch break and I get the news from our operations manager that my request for part-time have been approved - sweet! One extra day off is well worth the loss of $100 each week to maintain my mental sanity. So I was in a relatively good mood until I got a cold transfer from some bastard in sales. Issue? We're doing a BOGO deal right now for iPhones and the customer doesn't want to add a new line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPer promo details, BOGO = upgrade existing line and get up to X off on the \"get\" phone on a new/ported-in line. **NOT UPGRADE TWO EXISTING LINES**! Any noob fresh out of training knows that. Instead of conferencing the call to ask me if anything can be done, I have a customer dumped on me. Like I mentioned earlier, primary role is transfers. I hate care calls for shit like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone working in a CC knows how much AHT factors into literally everything. Even if that metric isn't counting against you, the higher your AHT, the less calls you take, the more you struggle balancing other stats. How long does a transfer of service take? About 10 minutes as long as the customer doesn't ask a million questions and if the system isn't crapping itself. The call the sales donkey caused? **OVER AN HOUR**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add salt to the wounds, the customer was one of those types that try to apply the pressure threatening to switch providers. If you want poor cell service to get a freebie, by all means switch. No new line, no BOGO deal - simple. I'm sorry supervisors don't have a magic button to just overturn a corporate policy. To put things into perspective of how dumb this whole ordeal was - The non BOGO iPhone promo was only $100 off WITH trade-in of an iPhone 5S or newer - customer had a a flip phone not even worth a dollar. My boss' boss gave me approval to waive $60 worth of activation fees and manually discount $250 off any phone of the customer's choice. That's $150 more than the actual promo. This also would have saved the customer $480 over 24 months the BOGO deal would have caused because of the new line requirement. We're talking an overall savings of $790!  An hour on the phone with this guy and going back and forth to our OM only to end up having the guy be indecisive and not take the offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy AHT was trashed, huge risk of failed survey, less calls to balance anything that matters like disconnects and for what? Some dipshit in sales to take the easy way out? Fuck that guy and fuck every donkey that is too lazy to do their job. You're the reason why customers distrust agents for these tales to exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Long, long ago, I worked cs for one of the major cellular providers. After a few years, they made me one of the guys who takes supervisor calls even though they aren't really a supervisor and don't have any real authority. So, I'm working late one night, and one of the reps rings me up to take a call. They can't quite articulate what the customer is mad about, but they assure me he's furious, so I tell them to transfer. I let the guy talk for a bit, and yes, he's mad, swearing repeatedly at me and the company and the previous rep and everything in a thick Irish accent. After a while, I manage to figure out one of the things he's mad about. He wants to know why he can't see certain calls in the list in the back of his bill. Further investigation leads me to the conclusion that he wants to see calls that happened AFTER the end of the billing cycle, which I explained to him wouldn't be there because the dates the bill covers end before those calls, and because he continues to rail about it I have to explain it a second time, after which he begins to scream louder. He's figured out he's stupid, so of course he's telling me I'm a fucking moron and playing like he doesn't finally get how idiotic the whole thing is. He tells me in so many words that he's now prepared to ride this bomb to hell and wants to speak to whomever is above me. I handed him off to my sup, and that was it for me. I later learned that he'd eventually gotten corporate cs, and that after listening to him they didn't want anything to do with him anymore since he didn't actually have an issue and the only thing we were doing was explaining it to him. I was also told that my supervisor, in all this, had to promise she'd fire me to shut him up about me personally, which she had no intention of doing and from then on when he called and the sup call came to me I got to escalate instantly because nobody wanted him knowing that I still worked there. I can still remember this guy's name, which is rare for five years at that company, and I haven't been there for seven.",

I walked in today (after calling out yesterday, and last Monday, and the Monday before...) to find out I’d been “released,” and I just walked back to my car with a huge smile. The monotony of asking the same questions and going through the same things, having to Aux out just to use the bathroom, being yelled at for accidentally being in after call for three minutes, piss poor training and having to make things up on the fly on calls, idiot customers, fake politeness and pleasantness, being watched like a hawk...I won’t miss any of it.  The only “good” thing was that, compared to my first job which is pretty mentally stressful, I could do this job in my sleep, but now I can literally just go to sleep once I leave my first job. The team leads really liked me and my work ethic; I pretty much came in, took calls, didn’t go over my allotted break time, engage in any gossip or drama, etc., but I understand that it’s probably better to have a body filling a seat taking calls full-time even if they’re mediocre than have a good employee that’s there a fraction of the time (team lead’s words that I was one of the best, not mine). Just happy to be free of it all, but I’ll probably never forget that annoying beep in my headset and my opening spiel, I think that remains ingrained in you for life, unfortunately. ",

        "text": "I work at the customer support call center for an alarm/smarthome company who's name rhymes with Divint. I do smarthome automation, traditional security systems, and tech scheduling/rescheduling. 30 minutes before my shift ends Avaya beeps and the customer is already screaming and spitting fire because their tech had no showed. The second I get done with verification the customer goes on a 30 minute rant about how we never send out techs right (the only other tech we had ever sent them was the install tech) and they've had 6 techs for this issue (this was the only workorder on the ticket) and now this tech didn't show up and how if they didn't get a tech out there \"RIGHT NOW\" then they should get the rest of their 5 year contract (which they were only 1 year into) for free. They even did that thing where they occasionally stop talking for a minute like they're giving you a chance to talk and then the moment you try and respond to them they snap \"DON'T INTERRUPT ME THAT'S SO RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL!\" and start talking again but if you stay silent they snap \"ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING!?\".\n\nBest of all the issue they were having was with the Philips Hue integration not even something critical like a security sensor or the thermostat. Even better the only problem was they had refused to troubleshoot with the agent enough to press 3 buttons to update their panel to a firmware that supports it. The original ticket said they had just immediately started screaming at the rep until they booked a tech for them.\n\nEventually they quit ranting and actually let me respond and I start setting up a new tech appointment. Since the tech didn't do anything but left detailed notes about waiting for the customer and them not responding to the cell number provided or the doorbell they didn't get charged but the next tech isn't waived. Que the customer literally screeching into the phone about not getting the next tech for free because \"we made them wait at home all day\" ect ect. Eventually they run out of steam and get a new appointment scheduled. Soonest available given it was not contract critical is a week out which of course sparked another scream session. Two hours into the call and it's finally booked I ask if there's anything else and they just start going over each of the issues addressed during the call and yelling about them and insulting my intelligence and threatening to get me fired for being so rude to them (I wasn't and the calls are recorded so QA also knows I wasn't).\n\n\nSince I can't hang up on customers until I get approval I just turn my headset down and use this as a chance to catch up on my work email and check my phone while I wait for my supe to listen in on the call and approve me hanging up. Out of curiosity I open up the panel history on their system. During the entire appointment window plus a couple hours on either side the panel had been armed away. Meaning that if it had detected motion, and the customer had a lot of motion sensors, it would have set off the alarm. In other words the customer had been demonstrably not home until over an hour after the tech's arrival window had expired. How do you even get that worked up about something you know was your fault? 20 minutes later my supervisor sends me a message that I can go ahead and hang up and once the customer pulls that staying quiet until you talk so they can snap at you for interrupting them thing I roll out the \"I feel this call is becoming unproductive\" line, which they just keep yelling over and I ignore and say anyway, and after they don't acknowledge it for 5 minutes I end the call and clock off.",

THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS I AM A LOYAL CUSTOMER AND I DESERVE AN EXTEPTION!  \n&gt;$Me: Right now what we can do is restore the services with the payment of the past due balance and extend the current balance, that is the option we have available.  \n&gt;$EC: IF YOU WON'T RESTORE MY SERVICE THEN I WANT TO CANCEL!  \n\nAnd this is where the customer learns a valuable life lesson, you see, collections cannot cancel the services of an account under all but one circumstance: that the account is already suspended for non payment.\n\n&gt;$Me: Sir, I'm terribly sorry you wish to do that and I can definitely help you with that, I must let you know that your account has and installment plan for one your devices, and that it will be accelerated if you cancel the services.  \n&gt;$EC: I don't care.  \n&gt;$Me: Ok sir, are you sure you want to proceed to cancellation?  \n&gt;$EC: I. TOLD. YOU. I. DO.  \n&gt;$Me: It will just take a moment sir, please do not hang up the call.  \n\n\nI then proceed to cancel the service as happy as if someone had given me a delicious Chile en Nogada and come back to $EC.\n\n&gt;$Me: Sir, I'm terribly sorry about all the issues you have been undergoing. I am glad to let you know that I managed to cancel your account successfully and you won't be charged for the services any longer. You will receive your last bill next month with the remaining installments and the existing balance.  \n&gt;$EC:....  \n&gt;$Me:....  \n&gt;$EC: YOU DID WHAT?!  \n&gt;$Me: I cancelled you account, just as you asked, is there som...  \n&gt;$EC: I THOUGHT YOU'D TRANSFER ME TO LOYALTY SO THEY COULD GIVE ME SOMETHING!!!  \n&gt;$Me: Oh, sorry sir, but since you explicitly said you wanted to cancel even after my confirmation the account got cancelled right away, where you not intending in going on with it then?  \n&gt;$EC: OF COURSE NOT! *insert some more rambling* So, there is no way to restore my services from suspension?  \n&gt;$Me: I wish there was, but the full past due balance had to be paid to do so.    \n&gt;$EC: Ok then, I'll pay you the past due balance to restore my services.  \n&gt;$Me: Well, now the services are cancelled, not suspended. You will have to pay the full balance to start the reactivation procedure.  \n&gt;$EC: *Rambles so more and finally gives in*\n\n\n**TL;DR: cx thinks he can play the \"I'm going to cancel\" game, but gets cancelled.**\n\n\n",

        "text": "First time posting her, so thank for reading.\n\nThis story is about two years old now but I can't forget it and need to share.\n\nI was working for a federal student loan service contracted by the federal government. Typically the calls that come in are \"I can't afford my loans, plz help\". But on this particular Friday after working an extra 10 hours that week of mandatory overtime, I got one of the most confusing calls.\n\nMe: thank you for calling bleep bleep servicing, my name is A and my I'd number is blarg. May I have your ssn please?\n\nCL: Hi A, I need to talk to someone about my account. Now it's very important that you take down everything I'm about to tell you.\n\nMe, but already concerned: I'd be happy to help, let me pull up your account so I add comments on the acct.\n\n*Confirms ID and contact info*\n\nMe: alright ma'am, what can I help you with today?\n\nCL: My account has been compromised. I am in the middle of testifying in a FBI case against the African American Mafia--they also call themselves the Gorilla Gang--for human trafficking. I watched them with their trucks which had shipments of sex trafficked workers and they are coming at me in all forms of my life, including student loans.\n\nI have been trying to get my loans consolidated but they kept getting it delayed (her account showed a delay from missing information and probably delayed it only 2 weeks)\n\nMe: um, okay. Well I'd like to suggest we add a security question for when you call in and we change your password for the website.\n\nCL: Okay. We can do that, but the group that is after me has people everywhere in all levels. They have probably infiltrated your company.\n\n*Fastword to the changes in her account security*\n\nCL: Okay, is there a department I can have review my account and I can have them get the information about the African American mafia?\n\nMe: um, I can add a note to the account with the information you gave me. Please allow me a moment to check with my supervisor if there's somewhere I can forward this too.\n\n*I then walked over to my team lead and in my best straight face told her about the woman on the phone. Also note I had to say Gorilla/African American Mafia to my black supervisor which caused literal head cocking*\n\nMe: what should I do?\n\nTL: You should probably tell that woman to get her head examined......but no, you already did what you were supposed to. There's no one to send this to. She can have you submit a complaint if she really wants.\n\n*Back to the phone*\n\nMe: thank you for holding ma'am. Unfortunately I don't have a department to send this to, but I can create a note in the account to add more accountability and send a complaint about our security.\n\nCL (crazy lady) then proceeded to give me more information about the the case, including the case number. She had me read what I typed back to her and wanted everything written to the exact detail. When she was satisfied, I copy pastaed then sent a complaint about security. I do not know how the court hearing went, nor am I convinced that her loans had been tampered with. Did she really testify in court? I think so. But all I really know is, that was the strangest phone call I'd ever had.\n\nTy for reading\nTldr; woman thinks the gorilla mafia messed with her student loan consolidation. ",

I hit my expiration date in May and could only “fake it til I make it” (happiness) until July. Im dreading tomorrow. I was dreading it my whole two weeks in Ireland. Idk what to do. I broke my lease and moved back home so I could do this but now that the moment is here I’m too afraid to do it. I’m going to start applying for jobs tonight but I’m not sure I can last another day, let alone another few weeks to a month. I’m afraid for my mental health.  ",

I just have to offer my condolences (I'm horrible at it), ask for the account information, and then transfer the call to another department. \n\nMe: I'm sorry for your lost Mrs Caller. \n\nC: Don't be sorry after all I'm not sorry, really. I'm just calling because I'm an authorize user  of this account and I want to know if I can keep using the account even if he passed away. \n\n(Wow)\n\nMe: I understand Mrs Customer. Actually all of that is handled by another department. \n\nC: Can you transfer the call?\n\nMe: Sure, I'm just going to need to ask for the account number and the last four digits of the primary's social security number, and then I can transfer the call. \n\nC: Sure, hold on a second. \n\nAfter she gave the information and I pulled up the account I couldn't help but notice he was born in 1937 and she was born in 1994. He was either her sugar daddy or there is some sort of messed up story there. I never knew. ",

Now the eligibility to receive a credit limit increase is based on your annual income, your payment history with us and your credit score. While I won't be able to see in the system the reason why your request was declined, you can see it online in our website or in the response letter we sent you.\n\nC: I know what the letter say, it's because I have late payments.\n\n(Then why the f\\*ck you call asking \"why\" if you already know).\n\nMe: Then I'm confused Mrs Customer, how may I assist you today?\n\nC: I mean my sister-in-law received her credit limit increase and I didn't. And I know she has as many debts as I do. That doesn't seem very fair.\n\nMe: I have no information on your sister-in-law account Mrs Customer, and I understand your concern because your request was declined. Now, there is no limit for how many times you can submitt an application. So if you wish, after you make the payments you can submitt another application.\n\nC: I don't want it anymore, I just want to know why my sister-in-law received her credit limit increase and I didn't. Racist much? If I were white you would've give me a credit limit increase, but alas I'm not so you not only decline me but also are incredible rude on the phone.\n\n(I don't feel like I have been rude, but I can try: \"First of all it's hardly my fault you don't pay on time. And I have zero control on who receives or doesn't receives a credit limit increase. Second of all why do you care so much what your sister-in-law receives, that's doesn't seem very healthy, thirdly I don't even know what race you or your sister-in-law are and I frankly don't care, besides I'm not even white, stop making everything about racism. You are an incredible childish woman\" Alas I don't think QA would've like that response very much).\n\nMe: Mrs Customer, I apologize if I came off as rude, it was not my intention.  The reasons why your credit limit increase was denied are exclusively the ones stated in the letter. All I can do for you right now is advicing you to make your payments and then you can submitt another application.\n\nC: Oh fuck you!\n\nMe: Thank you for calling \\*Bank's name\\* have a good day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs my supervisor pointed out I could have handled that call better but at least he agreed that Mrs Customer was being childist.",
