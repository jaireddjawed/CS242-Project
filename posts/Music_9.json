        "text": "Link to song:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwWL6GTK1RA\n\nThis is an exceptionally niche discussion and I'll be lucky to get even two comments on it, but anyway...  *(Also, be gentle - I had to Google about 20 times to make sure I was using chorus/bridge/harmony/melody correctly...and I'm still not sure I succeeded.  I love music and how it makes me feel, but I'm not versed in the terminology and theory of it.)*\n\nWhen it comes to music, I tend to identify with the melody, harmony and rhythm.  I appreciate the lyrics as *part* of that, but I don't necessarily care what those lyrics are *saying* - I care how they sound.  Interesting lyrics can add another layer of appreciation for me, but it's not critical for my enjoyment of a song.\n\nWith that said, I absolutely love the journey that this song takes me on. \n\nIt starts off with an almost sorrowfully slow build, giving you sensations of melancholy and longing.  It almost takes the entire opening minute before the song \"kicks in.\"  And when it does, it immediately elevates you.  Beautiful melody/harmony, joined by a driving bass - topped off with ethereal vocals.  The entire combination lifts you up and elevates you.  A sensation of emotional weightlessness - you're floating in the music, your body flowing to the rhythm.  You can almost sense a warm light washing over you, time flowing past you while you're above it all.  And just as you feel like you're about to drift off into another place, the chorus fades into the bridge and the high levels out with it - the ride slows down, fast-forward transitions into play, and the bridge brings you back into the present.\n\nBut the vibes not over.  The chorus lifted your focus up, while the bridge brings you back down into your soul.  The rhythm gets deeper, more passionate, deliberate.  It's a vibe.  *It's a god damn vibe*.  Your body's still flowing, but it's grounded.  Powerful.  You feel contentment and what can I only describe as an sanguine bittersweetness.  Life isn't perfect, but that's alright - life is still great, *and it's a fucking vibe*.  You're in the moment - resonating, harmonizing, *being*.  And then boom...the chorus is back.\n\nYou're lifted back up.  But if anything, it hits even harder now after the soulful richness of the chorus.  The steadying, mellowing effect of the rhythmic calm from the bridge makes you appreciate the elevation even more this time.  You enjoy the ride until what you assume is the next bridge...but it's slowing down.  No, wait, what?  It's fading!  The last 30 seconds are a slow decrescendo, and I don't like it!\n\nYou took me on this heavenly journey, you lifted up my spirit, you helped me find my center...and now you're dropping me off on a lonely island.  I feel like the boy that just went on a fabulous adventure...only to wake up and find out it was all a dream and none of it was real.  I'm sure there's beauty in that.  After all, the song started off with evoking feelings of longing, so it has a pleasing symmetry from that standpoint.  I can't really debate that.  It was an artistic choice, and it definitely has an effect.  It's beautiful.\n\nBut man, what I wouldn't give for an alternate reality where that long 30 second fall back to Earth at the end is just a misdirect.  Where right as you think the feather is going to gracefully land on the ground...a massive gust of wind blasts it back into orbit.  A couple seconds of aching silence gives way to the chorus kicking back in.  A false ending!  The ride is back!  But this time, the chorus is even more intense, more layered.  You're back on your magic carpet ride, but the sensations and emotions of the music envelope and overwhelm you.  You're not thinking.  You're just *feeling*.  This is it.  This is fucking it.  There is nothing else, just this feeling of euphoria.\n\nAnd then boom!  The fever pitch builds to an explosion and the bottom drops out.  But this time you're not left longing or lonely.  You're left *fulfilled*.  Satisfied.  Enriched.  The journey reached it's climax, and it left you *elevated*.  You're higher than you were before you heard it.  It left an imprint on you.\n\nDamn.  What an ending that would be.  And it would flow nicely into the next track on the album, On + Off, which is a high energy song through out - you dive off the clouds of Say It, and land on the mountaintop of On + Off.  What a journey, what a segque.\n\nOh well.  I'm not really sure my point in posting this.  Sometimes you just want to *say* something, and it's not so important if anyone *hears* it I guess.  Either way, now I feel satisfied.",

        "text": "What distinguishes abstract lyrics from nonsensical ramblings? Sometimes I find myself looking at song lyrics and I just can‚Äôt decipher what they mean. And it also seems like how well the lyrics are received by the public generally depends on who the artist is. If it‚Äôs an artist everyone loves to hate, it seems like everyone will naturally call their lyrics terrible, but if we‚Äôre talking about an artist that is well-respected, people will draw connections where the artist might not have intended to make one. It‚Äôs cool to draw connections to abstract lyrics as it makes the song much more relatable to the individual listening to it, but I feel like if you try hard enough, you can make that connection with any abstract song. So what qualities distinguish good abstract songs from bad ones? Any insight to this question would be much appreciated. \n(And obviously music is subjective so there‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù song. But some abstract songs are generally considered masterworks where others are not. I‚Äôd like to know what makes a song a masterpiece)",

Only when I get riled up and inspired by my watching my favorite artists performing in huge stadiums‚Ä¶.I start to imagine myself being like them for a temporary period of a few hours and my creativity starts flowing and I come with a few minutes of some music that I personally like very much‚Ä¶but then the morning light hits and I go to sleep and wake up in reality and the flow is dead‚Ä¶and I become depressed and my skill level of producing drops to zero and when I try to to finish the tracks by making more sections but they fucking suck and ruin the idea‚Ä¶\n\nThe only time I am remotely creative is when I childishly delude myself that one day I will sell out stadiums with my music‚Ä¶. I try many times to just finish my songs without any stress or expectation but the results are shitty and never blow me away.\n\nAs i said previously I don‚Äôt think I ever will get even a 100 listeners to my music if I ever release anything online\n\nBut I just want to create a song and upload it with a beautiful animation just for myself even if it gets zero views but I won‚Äôt ever be satisfied if I just upload some bullshit‚Ä¶it has to be good\n\nI really need to get on with the next chapter of my life and start thinking about my future but this unfulfilled desire of mine is really holding me back‚Ä¶I keep on thinking about music when I focus on some other work and ultimately spend hours back on my laptop to create new music and abandoning previous unfinished projects because they give me anxiety when I try to finish them‚Ä¶\n\nI want to expand my skill level by watching theory and production tutorials online but it just gives me freezing anxiety because it reminds me of fucking school and music was always my escape from the depressing education system so NO‚Ä¶I will never go to music college.\n\nI wish I never downloaded a DAW‚Ä¶but it has become a part of my soul‚Ä¶.I need to make an album for an audience of one but It has to be a masterpiece‚Ä¶.\n\nHow do I do this? \n\nPlease be kind with your words‚Ä¶please.  :(",
