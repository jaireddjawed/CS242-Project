There is no vegitation in the south pole, nor are there any planes going over it/no images of Antarctica.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.

Considering our solar system is traveling in a certain direction around our galaxy, with our current technology, if we were to travel in the opposite direction in a space shuttle wouldn't we begin to slow down relative to our solar system?  If we traveled that direction long enough wouldn't it become impossible to catch back up?  Essentially becoming forever lost in space?\n\nUsing a quick google search, it looks like our solar system is traveling 140 miles per second around the Milky Way.  Our fastest manned space shuttle was only around 7 miles per second.  It seems if we accidently traveled in the opposite direction even for a little bit we'd be doomed in space forever.",

With all that matter being so tightly packed into one tiny space once it explodes it could possibly release all its contents as nothing more then star dust and space debris that travels across the void of space until it gets caught in the orbit of a new black hole. From there over billions of years it could form into new stars and planets. Our solar system is in the outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy so maybe we are relative new comers to the Milky Way. The James Webb telescope has also shown us that the universe may be older then we originally thought as well. Maybe it’s a possibility.",
