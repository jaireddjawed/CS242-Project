As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; This Risk Factor discussion of the company’s insurance arrangements does not specifically refer to the company’s D&amp;O insurance. The discussion at least raises the possibility that the company does not carry D&amp;O insurance, or that the D&amp;O insurance has a very high deductible or that the company does not carry the amount of insurance that other companies of Tesla’s size might carry. The company’s approach to insurance obviously is calculated as a way to try to save money. If the company applied this approach to its purchase of D&amp;O insurance, the savings the company earned by this approach are about to be complexly subsumed by litigation costs.\n\nhttps://www.dandodiary.com/2018/08/articles/securities-litigation/tesla-investors-file-securities-suits-elon-musks-take-private-tweets/",
