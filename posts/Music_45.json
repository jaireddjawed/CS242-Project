To the best of my knowledge, despite my suggesting this, the other site still has all the tracks still available to buy including the faulty final track (error occurs at 6:22).\n\nThe bitrates of the digital downloaded tracks differ from those ripped from the CD only by virtue of being 2 points higher per track, so, not having done any spectrum analysis stuff, one can be reasonably assured that they have come from an official master.",

To play their instruments really well but not be able to sing? Obviously you don't have to be an amazing singer, but at least be in tune .... or were they just lying because they were shy and didn't want to sing in front of me? Lol\n\nFor context they haven't been trained classically (in Western European 18th century music), so they wouldn't have done formal aural skills lessons... but still?",
