        "text": "http://playdevilsadvocate.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/fundamental-islam-and-the-liberal-debate/\n\nAs per the suggestion of /u/monkeyfightingsnake - here's a summary (or a TL;DR):\n\nI argue that the stigma associated with criticizing Islam is due to 3(ish) reasons.\n\n1) That islamophobia (define as bigotry towards innocent Muslims) is real (e.g. the 'ground zero mosque) - and liberals have spent the last decade, rightly defending bigoted attacks - that it's now difficult to separate attacks on Muslims and attacks on Islam.\n\n2) That what Islam is to liberals is not what it is to Harris, Maher, etc.  Liberals see Islam as just another religion w - as they have many Muslim friends who go out for drinks and don't cover their faces/wives faces with Hijabs.  Subsequently anyone who seeks to kill apostates etc., is clearly not practicing Islam.  Harris, Maher, etc. say just the opposite - Islam is about killing apostates, that Muslim friend you have is probably a great guy/girl, and it's because he/she DOESN'T practice Islam by the book.\n\n3) Affirming the consequent (If A=&gt;B, then B=&gt;A - a fallacy).   If one agrees with Harris, and takes Islam to mean it at it's fundamental level - then we can say that all those practicing Islam are Muslims, but clearly not all those who identify with Muslim practice Islam.  I liken it to, all those who keep kosher are Jewish, but clearly not all those who are Jewish keep Kosher - a point I doubt anyone would disagree with.  However, with Islam, you can replace 'kosher' with killing apostates, whipping women who don't wear hijabs, etc - and the logic is the same, yet for some reason it's off limits?  \n\nLastly, I argue that Islam, like any idea,  is not an island onto itself - but it's generally clear, that the more weight you give to ideas in Islam/the less competing ideas you have - the more heinous it becomes.  So ya, when American or Canadian Muslims don't go around killing people - it's not because Islam is all good - it's because they live in a society that presents them with alternative ideas and values. \n\n\n",

        "text": "On my phone, so sorry...\n\nA friend I've known since high school is at the precipice of atheism (he began as devout Southern Baptist). To put this in context, we met at 17 and are now 40 years old. He has always known me as atheist. We would constantly have theological (or lack thereof) discussions in our school lunchroom. We lost contact for several years until Facebook appeared on the scene and reconnected. He had followed his religious trajectory into higher education; eventually getting his doctorate in theology. The surprising thing was that the further he went down the rabbit hole, the more questions he began asking. And what began with questions led to a liberalization of ideology - something that irked the religious hierarchy. The winds of fate eventually dropped me into the same city as he and we started hanging out again. One day while hiking he told me what was happening in his life - all the questions he asked, differing viewpoints, etc. I finally asked what conclusions his vast studies brought him to. He got quiet for a moment, then said that mans concepts on god couldn't possibly be correct, and no church he and his wife attended filled the gaps for him as it once did. There was no spiritual nourishment. He'd peered through the looking glass and could not un-peer. I told him that, for lack if better terms, \"the awakening\" is always difficult. I'd been through it myself, albeit at a much younger age. He has concerns, such as his relationship with his wife. She is still very much religious. He loves her, but has thoughts as to how she would react if he came out as atheist. My recommendation was to sit with her and discuss all the non-religious facets that draw them together as a couple and grow from there. I'm planning on hiking again with him this weekend and talk more about his thoughts.\n\nI really don't know the point of this post, other than people can change. People have the ability to, when given volumes of evidence, draw logical conclusions and think for themselves, free of invisible constraints.",

Although we both agree with everything he says, and agree with this statement; her view is that phrasing things in such a way is inflammatory and in the long run is not going to encourage muslims to think about reforming their religion, it's just going to make them feel like the West is against them.\n\nMy response to this, is that firstly, it's difficult to stimulate debate in the American media without saying something polarising. Plus—assuming radical Islam is indeed a threat to civilisation, and a big part of the answer to that is to have genuinely honest conversations about the problem (in the media and elsewhere)—it's arguable that trying to avoid offending Muslims should be less of a priority than doing what it takes to get people talking.\n\nIs Sam wrong to use such polarising phrases?",

        "text": "Hey guys, first time posting to TrueAtheism, so I hope I can meet the expectations and requirements here. My point is not to start a circle jerk or to get justification for my actions - rather lack of action in this scenario.\n\nI live in Oklahoma, buckle of the bible belt, I went camping in an area that is very right-wing, very pro-christian. On my way down I stopped by a Wal-Mart to pick up some additional supplies. In the parking lot I returned my cart to the cart collector. Parked next to the collector was an elderly woman who had just finished loading her things into her vehicle. She wasn't disabled per se, but was slow moving and had a hobble to her. I offered to take her cart, she said \"Yes, thank you.\" I took the cart and put it up and began walking back to my truck, which was passed the elderly woman I had just assisted. - I want to pause here and state that I do not do things like this often, and when I do, I do not expect anything beyond a thank you. I don't want money or overwhelming gratitude for something so simple. - She met me at the back of her vehicle, and greeted me with a \"I wanted to give you this\", a pat on my shoulder and handed me a flyer for her church, she continued with \"I've been going to this church for years now, if you need a church to attend please join us.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say, I wasn't expecting anything from her, she had already said thank you. I didn't want money, I didn't want additional gratitude, but I certainly didn't want the offer to attend her church. I was caught off guard, so I just said \"uh, thanks.\" and went on to my vehicle. What I wanted to say was that I didn't need to attend their church and that I was doing what I did to be good to be good and not good because of a religion. I reflected on this for awhile; a part of me was upset that I didn't take this as an opportunity to question why she had given me that, or to try and prove a point. \n\nIf ever given another opportunity, depending on the person and the situation should I take the route of debating or just leave it be? What would you do in this situation?\n\n",

        "text": "This probably belongs to /r/offmychest, but I thought you guys might understand better. I guess this has probably been posted many times before, but I want to say it somewhere. Today I realised I miss one aspect of being religious. I meet so many people who are certain of what they’re doing, or at least doing a great job of pretending to be certain.\n\nMany times, the reason is that ‘God put them on that path’. Or God is watching over them. Whatever the reason, I remember that feeling from when I was young. That vague feeling that things are going alright, because everything will add up to a complete picture of what your life must be like. \n\nMy friend told me she had to choose a direction in her life – to work either with people, or animals – and made the decision based on a bible verse. Sure, one can call her stupid, or weak, or any number of things. But she has a serenity to her that I know I don’t have. I’m terrified that the choices I make will be wrong, and screw up my life, with nobody to pick me up if I fail except myself or the people who love me.\n\nI’m looking at a situation where I have to choose – very soon – between two postgrad programs that are quite different from one another. It’s looking like I’m going to be accepted for both. I don’t know which one to choose. My parents tell me it’s my decision, and that scares the hell out of me. I find myself wishing I don't get in for both, just so I don't have to choose. How sad is that? I wish sometimes I could just pray like millions of others, and feel as if it will all work out for some mystical reason. \n\nFeel welcome to add your two cents…how you deal with the crushing uncertainty, or anything at all. I don’t know if I’d call myself an atheist, I guess I’d rather say agnostic. But the one thing I find very difficult to believe in is a God who personally cares about me. I just don’t. \n\n*edit* I'm going to bed soon, it's late where I live. Please feel free to add anything, I'll read through it tomorrow. Thanks for all the advice and comments so far, you guys make me feel more at peace with the uncertainty. ",

        "text": "Several months ago [I submitted a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/25bsn0/circumcision/) about circumcision to begin fact finding as my wife and I were going to try and get pregnant this year. There were some good responses but also some less level-headed responses.\n\nAs it turns out, my wife is pregnant and I thought I'd give an update after talking to our doctor about circumcision (we don't know if we're having a boy yet). Here are the medical facts available to me.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\n- In the United States, approximately 80% of males are circumcised between the ages of 14 and 59, although the numbers of circumcised newborns today is closer to 50/50 depending on the state you live in.\n\n- In addition to medical factors described below, parents tend to circumcise their sons because of religion, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, race, ethnicity, or whether the father is circumcised.\n\n**Potential Benefits**\n\n- Reduction in Urinary Tract Infection: In uncircumcised males the preputial space provides a warm and moist environment which is more likely to trap pathogens and allow pathogens to survive and replicate. A study (which was *not* a large, randomized trial) concluded that circumcision reduced UTIs in infants by nearly 90%.\n\n- Reduction in risk of penile cancer: Circumcisions have showed a link to a reduction in risk to penile cancer. However, penile cancer is very rare. So rare that a circumcised infant is more likely to have serious complications during the procedure than an uncircumcised infant is to contract penile cancer.\n\n- Reduction in risk of cervical cancer in partners: Circumcised men have a lower prevalence of HPV infection which is likely related to a reduced risk in cervical cancer in partners.\n\n- Reduction in penile inflammation: One study (of ~600 boys) showed that 14 in 100 uncircumcised boys reported penile inflammation where 8 in 100 circumcised boys reported penile inflammation.\n\n- Reduction in the contraction of STDs: Circumcision is linked to reduced risk in contracting HIV, HPV, and herpes. However, circumcision did not show a reduction in other STDs such as gonorrhoeae.\n\n- Easier hygiene: It is generally easier to keep a circumcised penis clean than an uncircumcised penis.\n\n**Potential Disadvantages**\n\n- Procedure complications: Accurate complication rates are not currently available due to timing of the procedures, technique, provider type, as well as other factors. However, one study of 200,000 circumcisions showed that 0.2% (1 in 500) resulted in a complication. Other potential complications (though with no associated statistics) include bleeding, infection, injury, adhesion, anesthetic complications, as well as others.\n\n- Sexual dissatisfaction: The end of the penis may become less sensitive though males who were uncircumcised and got circumcised later did not report a significant difference in sexual pleasure.\n\n- Pain: Removal of the foreskin is painful, especially if performed once the male is sexual active. Studies have shown that infants show behavioral changes within the first 24 hours of circumcision but no statistically significant behavioral changes after 24 hours.\n\nThe above bullet point summaries are just that, summaries from more extensive documentation. However, one thing I can conclude is that studies around circumcision are either difficult to perform due to the number of variables involved, or are not using large random samples. As such, it is difficult to have a high degree of confidence in the numbers reported.\n\n**My interpretation**\n\n- The reduction in risk of penile cancer is irrelevant to me if circumcision is more likely to cause complications than to prevent penile cancer.\n\n- The reduction in contracting STDs is also less important to me. I plan on teaching my children about safe sex, being loyal to your partner, and being aware and educated about STDs, instead of relying on circumcision to prevent contracting an STD.\n\n- Easier hygiene is not convincing to me and I was surprised to see it in a medical text. By the same reason I should cut off my kids' earlobes because it's easier to keep clean. To me, this again is an education thing. Just as we need to keep our eyes, ears, hands, and everything else clean, uncircumcised boys also need to keep under their foreskin clean.\n\n- The procedural complications seemed pretty rare. However, the descriptions of what happens during a complication was not appealing.\n\n- Sexual dissatisfaction is a moot point to me, assuming no procedural complications. Not to rely too heavily on a single anecdote, but I'm circumcised and sex is definitely satisfying.\n\n- The point about pain is very relevant, especially if we don't circumcise our (possible) son and he chooses to get circumcised later in life.\n\n**Where to go from here**\n\nMy wife and I need to sit down and seriously talk about this still and then discuss it more with our doctor. I'm leaning towards no circumcision and she's leaning the other way. Whatever we do decide, we will decide together and we will use medical facts to support our decision. Not religion, tradition, reddit anecdotes, or anything else. Medical facts.\n\n**Should you circumcise your future son?**\n\nIf you take away anything from reading this post let it be this. Get the most recent medical facts available to you and base your decision on that. Don't use my summary bullet points. Don't use the highest voted comment in this thread. *Talk to your doctor*. Read the information from the latest studies. Discuss benefits and disadvantages with your partner and make a decision together.",

        "text": "I came across a 2009 Pew study (http://www.pewforum.org/2009/04/27/faith-in-flux/) which showed that a number of people polled became religious ***later*** in life.  In other words they grew up unaffiliated with religion and then became religious as adults.\n\nI found this somewhat surprising and it left me with two questions that beg to be answered.\n\nFirst - does the poll seem balanced/accurate?  Do you think that the results reflect a change from atheism to theism or is this something else?  I'm intentionally not offering up my view here as I don't want to muddy the water.\n\nSecond - if the poll *does* seem to fit with the rest of what you've seen going on then what reasons might you give for this?\n\nThe results also showed a few things that I think are interesting points of discussion - \n\n- 56% of those surveyed maintained the religion of their childhood.  I would have thought that number would be higher - though that's still high.  I wonder if the 'new atheism' will drive that number down.\n\n- Protestants in the survey changed to other forms of Protestantism in relatively high numbers - more so than to unaffiliated by almost double.  I suppose this is related to the wide variety of Protestant denominations but maybe there are other reasons?\n\n- Catholics 'lost their faith' at half the rate of Protestants.  My gut tells me that those numbers have changed in the last 5 years given what we're seeing in the Catholic church\n\nPlease don't just bash the poll.  We all know that there are a lot of unanswered questions related to every poll and this one is no different.  There's no reference to Jews or Muslims or Buddhists, there's no geographic or economic correlations made - there's a lot of missing information here.  All the same - there's some info here worth digesting.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So Wilson's primary argument (in nearly all of his debates with Hitchens) seems to be that when Hitch uses logic, he is essentially opening up his own \"Bible.\" He explains his position in greater detail [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RNUO5bvvS8&amp;t=688)  \n\nHe continues from this position to say that \"no love, art, debate, etc. is possible because we are (according to an atheistic world view) only molecules in motion.\"  \n\nHere is what I don't understand: he seems to be mixing his worldview with Christopher's and then leading to a nonsensical claim for two reasons (I think). \n\n---\n\n*Firstly,* he wants there to be an objective standard for love, beauty, and art, but I have never heard *why* these standards *must* be objective. Until Wilson can give a reason *why* there should be an objective underpinning of these things, his argument makes no sense whatsoever.  \n\nWilson's statement would be akin to Christopher saying, \"Your worldview is wrong because it has a god in it and mine doesn't.\" That's *not* an argument. This is just my opinion, but I can't possibly see why the \"basis\" of love, art, beauty, etc. actually matters, they're extrapolations from reality, based on (and similar to in construction) the laws of logic.   \n\nWilson seems to be caught in a catch-22, he needs love/beauty/art to be objective to prove god, but he needs god to prove the objectivity of love/beauty/art. Is there something I'm missing? This argument seems to be terrible. \n\n---  \n\n*Secondly,* if Wilson is only accepting the Bible as his worldview, doesn't this devolve every possible belief he could have about reality into madness? If Wilson is referring to the Bible *before* logic, then every explanation the Bible gives for sickness, illness, laws, social etiquette, or *anything* is to be approached first.   \n\nAt first I thought I simply must have misheard him, but upon further research, Wilson is actually completely *for* things like Biblically mandated slavery. He really does do everything in his power to place the Bible as the first and only place to consult.\n\nBut, there still seems to be something very very wrong with this line of thinking. Does he not need some form of logic to understand the damn Bible? How is he placing the Bible before simple logical steps like learning language, learning how to turn pages? Logic seems to be a pretty fundamental prerequisite to reading. How is he placing the Bible above that?  \n\n---\n\n\nThis seems so strange and odd to me. Does anyone have any thoughts or maybe can clarify Wilson's positions to me? Because as it stands, he seems like somewhat of a lunatic. \n",

It is disconcerting because **(clearly the marginalization and stereotyping of Muslims is terrible)* the conversation about Islam (and other religions for that matter) needs to be had, but the new entries to the discussion *(seemingly right wing Christians)* destruct and dilute good discussion. Because of bad criticism, well reasoned criticism will be more difficult to have.

What Dawkins did not realize is that evolution passes only the traits for survival (which you agree also), but is NOT concerned with preserving traits that tell humans what is REALLY \"true\" about life. And if naturalism is true, the traits we have that were passed by our ancestors are nothing but a result of paranoid delusion, rather than the actual assessment of the world around us, because studies show that paranoia makes an individual think about \"survival\" rather than assessing the environment. That means if naturalism is true, then everything we perceive by our senses as \"true\" are not actually true, and we have no way of determining what is true about life. Therefore, the idea of naturalism is self-defeating because you can't believe in naturalism, and believe it to be true. \n\nNow if you think like what you are thinking is actually true, and you think your mind is operating as if you know what's true, then you must be saying that naturalism is false. You can believe in naturalism by denying \"logic\" itself. Whilst in theism, we believed that there is a Creator/moral encoder who gave us and helped us distinguish what is really true in life, which sounds more logically coherent than naturalism.\n\nAlso, Charles Darwin admitted that he is a theist, because he knows that evolution is just a process of the diversity of life....but how about the beginning?\"\n\nedit: thanks guys! made things a lot clearer.",

        "text": "I'd say no, we don't have it. I see no more evidence for it than I do in God, and free will seems like a concept much easier to disprove than God. Since free will would need to exist inside our physical brains, and that's something we can draw definitive conclusions on; unlike a magic fatman in the sky that exists outside of the laws of physics. We are basically the sum of our genetics and our life experiences. We don't get to choose our parents, and we don't get to choose our first experiences which begin the forming of our neural pathways which cause our first choice and that leads to our next choices, and the next, and the next until you die. Some will argue that there is some pure randomness thrown in there too, so that life isn't purely deterministic. They think that just because life may not be one long determined chain of events since the big bang that it means free will is possible. But they haven't accepted that people can't be held responsible for pure randomness any more than a path they could never have deviated from.. because by definition randomness is uncontrollable. You might wonder why this is important, and I think Sam Harris has the best argument for that. To sum up his opinion, we react in a much less pleasant way when we are wronged by another human because of our belief that they have free will. We think that they had a choice and that they could have chosen not to hurt us. So we hate people more than we would ever hate any other animal that hurt us. But the belief in free will affects everything that has to do with humans.. which to most of us is just about everything of significance. It's definitely worth the time to disabuse yourself of your illusion of free will so that you can be a happier and more productive person. But all this is just my opinion, and I'm hoping to get the opinions of my fellow atheists on the subject as well. I'll also link Sam Harris's youtube video about why free will is impossible and why it's important for us to accept it. He explains it much better than I can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FanhvXO9Pk&amp;list=FL22AZX1HOqEAFrx92K-5ENA&amp;index=1",

He was raised in a religious household, married early to a very religious woman, and raised two kids in their church.

He's been remarried to another very close friend of mine (which is how we met).\n\nBut today he contacted me with some doubts and misgivings. Not about leaving the church or his religion, but on general loss of direction. He admits to becoming a bit depressed lately, wondering about the \"whys\" of life.\n\nBut since I didn't \"come out\" or lose a religion, I can't honestly relate to this feeling.

Their distaste does not appear to be based in understanding as they don't even seem interested in reading philosophy. Dumping on an entire field while being uninformed about it seems, dare I say, a bit anti-intellectual. And this does clearly bother people like Dan Dennett and Massimo Pigliucci.\n\nSo the discussion question I'm most curious about is: what motivates this behavior? If I had to hazard a guess it might be that the field seems threatening to someone who sees science as an unassailable form of answering all questions, or maybe it's just an uninformed perception that philosophy is useless mental masturbation with no attachment to scientific facts. Curious on your thoughts.\n\n*This requires some elaboration as Harris does write books on morality and free will.

        "text": "I've been struggling with the idea of *equality* since abandoning my faith. The idea that human beings are equal seems to rest on a number of religious or metaphysical assumptions.\n\nEquality is something that is not found in physical reality. Only abstract objects can be equal. No two physical objects share the *exact* same properties. At the very least, they cannot even share the same space. Any two objects can be virtually guaranteed to be comprised of a different number of particles, have different energies, and different configurations of atoms at any given time.\n\nIt just doesn't seem to make much sense to draw a boundary around all living things that we consider \"human\" and say that these are all special and equal beings with some fundamental invisible sameness to them. It is just an arbitrary biological distinction. We are just one branch of the tree of life. If all people are equal, why aren't all people equal to all dogs and all trees, as well?\n\nI want to treat everybody with compassion, and I believe that we should minimize unnecessary suffering, but I cannot find any foundation for special equality of all human beings.",

        "text": "He bites hook, line, and sinker on a God of the Gaps argument.  He says, “…evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.”   He is supporting direct intervention from god to create the first life.  We have not yet shown that non-living matter can become living matter through natural processes of physics and chemistry.  This is the gap that he is filling with a god claim.  He says his god is not a wizard but he is quite clearly giving him supernatural powers.\n\nAlso, the Pope acknowledges that the Adam and Eve story is not an accurate representation of god’s actions. His position is that god started the origin of life and then did not intervene while natural selection and genetic diversification through reproduction led to new species. The Bible claims that god put all creatures on Earth exactly as they appear.  The creation story specifies god creating “the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. (Gen 1:21)”, “the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind. (Gen 1:25)”, followed by making “mankind in our image, in our likeness (Gen 1:26).”  The Pope says that god made the big bang happen, let natural processes take place, and intervened once more to create life.\n\nThis is important because the top ranking member of the largest group of Christians rejects the factual accuracy of stories in his own holy book and uses one of the weakest arguments to support still believing that his god started all life.\n\nPope’s quotes source: http://www.religionnews.com/2014/10/27/pope-francis-evolution-inconsistent-notion-creation/\nBible source from NIV: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1\n",

My family goes to a church that just started a series on science and faith, and I think this is a good opportunity for me to discuss with her and the rest of my family what I believe and why I don't believe what they do. Are there any online resources I can use to help fuel the discussion which won't make them feel like they are being attacked? I am open to all formats of media, videos are probably the best, but so many of Dawkins, Hitchens, Krauss and harris's arguments are put rather bluntly, instead of trying to kindly teach their point of view. Thanks for your input. \n\nThey go to a mega church that broadcasts services online, so if anyone is interested in discussing them week to week, pm me. The church website is here: https://kensingtonchurch.org\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: my sister has specifically asked for my opinion on the series, and my family has expressed interest in discussing this with me so I am not bringing it up out of the blue or forcing the issue.

        "text": "So I posted an argument a few days ago which I phrased rather poorly and I got the internet version of my head handed to me on a stick for it.  I'm absolutely not complaining - I did it, I deserve what came next, and I entirely respect people who can point out a bad argument. I appreciate both the education I got from some of the replies and the polite tone with which they were delivered.\n\nThe core of the argument is still stirring around in me and I was hoping that you guys/gals could help me develop it.\n\nThis is the thing.\n\nReligious freedom is an important concept.  It's important to both the religious - to be able to exercise their faith with no interference from government - and to the irreligious - who are able to 'not' do that.\n\nI don't think that I would want to live in a society that doesn't have that concept as a core value.  While I resent religion I respect each persons right to hold their beliefs so long as they don't infringe on the rights of others.\n\nBut religious freedom involves beliefs.  And beliefs, when acted upon, have real world consequences.  I'm hoping we can agree that for atheists 'beliefs' tend to be based upon reason and rationality.  Not in all cases, I know, but my point is that an atheist may act poorly for bad reasons - but the reasons will be ones that are subject to scrutiny and are a)falsifiable, and b)examinable.  I'm trying to word this carefully so that it covers only what I'm saying and doesn't cast too wide a net.  By this I'm trying to cover things like the refusal of blood products by JW's.  I wholly accept that atheists can have supernatural beliefs that may influence their actions but those beliefs are not, to the best of my knowledge, covered by the blanket of 'religious freedom' in the same way that religious beliefs are.  For example, atheists may believe in an afterlife or ghosts or any number of things.  But those beliefs, as far as I know, will not get you a religious exemption of any sort in a court of law.\n\nSo we know that \n\na) a society that allows religious freedom is better than one that does not\nb) religious actions are often based on supernatural claims that can not be examined. \n\n\nNow in the context of atheism I don't see a problem.  Atheist beliefs (if you can call them that) do not support harmful behavior (do they?)  But theistic beliefs can very much lead to harm.  Harm in the way of denial of medical treatment, denial of contraception, spread of AIDS from restrictions on condom use, and so forth.  \n\nOK - so here's the crux - how does a cogent argument get formed from this:\n\nHow do we determine when the supernatural claims inherent in some forms of religious freedom are too harmful for us to allow as a societal norm?  ie Should a court be able to say 'yes, you have religious freedom and can do whatever you want in the confines of your home/church but no the demands of your god that contraception is immoral doesn't meet the standards of the court so your claim is rejected.  In a more specific example should SCOTUS be examining claims like Hobby Lobby's and deciding if the entire contraception issue is even one that a religious adherent should be *permitted* to bring under cover of religious freedom? \n\nWe do this already for things like denying medical treatment to a child by JW's.  The court can intervene and permit the treatment against the wishes of the parents.  But to my understanding the court is NOT doing this because the REASON is BS - but rather because the child is not competent to make these choices and the parent is acting against the best interests of the child.  They're doing the right thing but for the wrong (and I don't care if it's wrong because it's the right thing to do) reasons.\n\nI'm wondering if you can keep the notion of religous freedom but be constrained from making claims that you can't prove in court.  \n\nIs there a way to separate religious freedom from the supernatural claims that it can bring with it?\n\nWhat is that way and should we be trying to pursue it?  \n\nWhat possible pitfalls could there be to this for society or atheists in particular?\n\nThe reason I've pushed this line of reasoning out again is because I'm trying to find a way where you can have your religious freedom in private but as soon as you use that freedom to pursue an agenda that has consequences for people other than adherents then your reason must stand up to scrutiny in a court of law.  This seems reasonable to me, though others may have reasons why this is unwise.  \n\n\n\nI hope I've worded this better and that those of you who responded before can take the time to add your insight.",

        "text": "Throwaway here.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm an American helping a friend in Ukraine try to outfit the medical unit of his father's battalion. We've reached out to a couple of church communities here, and have gotten prayers where we were hoping for concrete actions. I need to write a response to a very kind email from a pastor, but I'm so annoyed that I can't keep some snark from creeping in. I don't want to be mean to this man and could use some help adjusting my frame of mind, or just some tips for keeping my cool. *This is not a plea for money.* I'm just trying to provide enough detail to explain why I'm so aggravated.\n\nI can't figure out where to start, so I might as well start with some background. Ukraine had a revolution back in February and is now struggling against a Russian invasion. Ukraine's military has deteriorated in the years since the Soviet Union fell, and every brigade is woefully underequipped. Volunteers within Ukraine and around the world are working to provide things like blankets, uniforms, medical supplies, and other things the Ukrainian government simply doesn't have the money for. It seems like every battalion has been adopted by some group, or some loose assemblage of civilians. My friend G's dad is a doctor in his battalion, and since no one has adopted them yet, G took it upon himself to do so, with my help.\n\nG did a year as an exchange student in the US and has a small network of his own here. I serve as the point person for all US-based activity, such as it is.\n\nAs a result, I've had to deal with a couple of pastors. The first is from the church G--another atheist, incidentally--attended when he was here. G reached out to the pastor, who agreed to do what he could, shared a Facebook post G worked hard on, and then went silent. I wrote to the pastor, too, briefly explaining who I am and what my role in this is, and making myself available to address questions and concerns. I never heard a word back.\n\nThe second is the pastor at my parents' church. I asked my dad if their church ever takes up special collections. He spoke to the pastor about it, and the pastor said no, but there might be other avenues. He asked my dad to have me write him with the details, so I did.\n\nThis pastor did respond, and he was very kind. He said he'll bring it up at the next meeting of their missions committee, which reviews requests for monetary needs for international projects. In closing, he wrote:\n\n\"In the mean time [sic], I will continue to pray for those under this great stress, especially G’s father.\"\n\nThat sent me from zero to livid in nothing flat.\n\nThree of my secular friends have ponied up. Between them, they've pitched in about $1100, not including about $100 of warm socks and another lot of money's worth of American Army uniforms. Two of them are college students and one has quite a lot of debt, but that didn't stop them from stepping up when they were needed.\n\nBy contrast, churches are supposed to help the needy, right? Yet I've got a pastor who said he wanted to help and promptly fell off the map. I was already mildly annoyed by his flock, whom I've seen posting endless \"We're praying for you!\" messages to G's FB wall but not offering a thin dime to help; his sudden silence has sent me into a white-hot fury.\n\nUnfortunately, that white-hot fury is carrying over to my parents' pastor, who read what I had to say, commended the work we're doing, and briefly outlined a plan of action. Whether it comes to fruition or not is irrelevant; the point is that he responded graciously and with a clear intent to at least *try*.\n\nI want to respond in kind and show him that I'm appreciative, but the general overarching annoyance with prayers instead of action just keeps finding its way in. I'm a grown-ass woman who should be able to bite her tongue (well, fingers, I guess, since this is an email thing), but so help me, I can't!\n\nSo! I turn to you. I've always tried to look at prayer as a nice expression of caring--someone is willing to intercede with their deity on my behalf, know what I mean?--and I'm trying hard to do it in this pastor's case as well, but the (in)actions of his brethren are making it impossible for me. How can I avoid taking out on my frustration on this man who means well?",

        "text": "[EDIT]\nPlease do not comment on this post.  I've left it up in its entirety as I think it's the honest thing to do and Redditors have spent their time responding to it with many good points.  I phrased this poorly and it is an argument of which I'm not proud.  I still stand by the core - the 'what I meant' - and will try to rephrase it.  But what I meant vs what I posted are chalk and cheese.  Sorry.\n\nI'm gonna point out four scenarios - four of LOTS.  \n\nIn the first 3 scenarios we have people who are acting on the word of god.  They're doing horrible things - but god is their motivation.  In all 3 of these our courts reject their claims, point out the underlying mental illness, and deal with them in an entirely secular fashion.\n\nIn the fourth scenario the claim is still supernatural yet SCOTUS rules in their favor.\n\nI ask you - how are these so very different?  Yes - I'll give you that the first 3 are crimes against society or against vulnerable members of society.  But the fourth is an attack on a segment of our society too - they've just put lipstick on this pig.\n\n\n##Victoria Soliz\nLast year (2013) Victoria Soliz attempted to drown her 3 year old child by holding him face down in a puddle.  She claimed that Jesus told her to do it.  It turns out she was self medicating for her schizophrenia with meth.  Who'd have thought that was a bad idea.  She went to jail.\n\n##Melissa Miller \nThis prize of a woman was pulled over doing 100mph in a 30 zone.  She told the police officer god had told her to do it.  She was arrested for reckless driving\n\n##Levi Staver\nThis Darwin nominee stabbed his grandmother to death because Archangel Michael told him to.  He's been arrested and charged\n\n##Hobby Lobby vs Sebelius\nA privately held corporation claims that their god doesn't want them to pay for contraceptives for their female employees.  Apparently drips of goo have souls.  Their case goes all the way to the supreme court and they win.  No goo needed to testify nor were any souls cross examined.\n\n\n\nIs the difference the kind of crime?  Or the wealth of the claimant?  It clearly can't be the strength of the argument?  They're both claiming supernatural forces guided their actions\n\n\n\nThe hypocrisy is sickening.  \n\n",

Drinking for me was never about religion or \"god\".  In all honesty, I drank so much because Im bored...that's really it.  I drank because I had nothing else to do.  But I won't deny that it's been a problem.\n\nFor those that don't know much about AA, a very large portion of it is relying on a \"higher power\" for you to pretty much submit yourself to in order to Achieve sobriety.\n\nI'm not exactly okay with that.  \n\nI realize that I put myself into this situation, I'm the one that fucked up and got myself to where I am.  So, realizing that I'm drinking too much, I went to AA last week and met an amazing support group, we've been hanging out and going to meetings every night and its been great, I finally have shit to do.\n\nBut the talk of the \"higher power\" comes up constantly, and it frustrates me.  And how I need to find my \"higher power\".  \n\nBut I want to keep going and keep meeting new people, it really has been great.  I've gone almost two weeks without a drink and it has been really easy, I'm not nearly as Fucked up as most of these people I've met are.   And they lean heavily on the \"high power\" to help them out, and it's working for them, I don't want to argue with them about this.   I'd rather someone believe, than be drunk/high/homeless on the street.  It works for them.

        "text": "So one of the more intriguing things Harris said in his talk with Cenk Uygur went something like this.\n\nLet's say you see a guy on TV who killed his neighbor with an axe.  The news interviews him and ask him why he did it and he says that life wasn't going well for him - he lost his job - his wife wasn't into him anymore.  He saw that his neighbor was doing really well and he was overcome with jealousy.  In a fit of rage he killed him.\n\nYou would take that man at his word.\n\nIf a suicide bomber in the West Bank is being interviewed before they detonate the device and they say that they're doing this because they feel desperate that their homeland is occupied by Israel and they don't see another way out then you would take them at their word too.\n\nBut if a suicide bomber says that they are doing it because all infidels must die.  They want to fulfill biblical prophecy and they fully expect to go to paradise for martyrdom where 72 virgins are waiting for them we are likely to discount their story and replace it with our own.  This person is seen as 'oh... they're just saying that - really they're upset about Israeli occupation or US corporations taking their resources.  \n\nOr when an American citizen who's never had an uncomfortable day in their lives becomes enamored with the more violent passages in the Q'uran and heads off to join ISIS in order to kill infidels - once again we won't accept a religious reason - we instead adapt our own narrative - family problems - peer acceptance problems - mental issues - whatever - just to take away the religious reason.\n\nIt seems that only when someone gives a purely religious reason are we likely to work backwards and attribute a different motivation to them.\n\nI thought that was an interesting observation.\n\nIs this because we inherently don't believe the religious claims?   Or maybe we don't believe them so we figure nobody else does either.   As a society are even our most religious adherents atheists about some topics?\n\nWe don't accept 'god told me to' as a reason in court - and it seems we won't accept it as a reason for suicide bombings or jihad.  Not all of us of course - but even secular liberals - who you would expect would have no problem with this explanation - are wont to redefine the narrative.\n\nWhy do you think that is?",

It wasn't at all convincing or novel to me, but many of my more rabidly anti-secularism colleagues have latched on to it.  What makes this one special?

They do not oppose each other on this issue; it is instead typically another group (vegans, PETA, and whatnot) who oppose both groups on this front.\n\nWith all of the conflicts between scientists and fundamentalists (abortion, the evolutionary timescale, climate change, etc.), an agreement seems to be quite a rare case.

        "text": "[edit] in retrospect the title is misleading - sorry.  This is more about 'nothingness' than it is about the universe coming into existence\n\nOne of the go to arguments for a deistic ontology is that nothing can come from nothing.  That argument flows off the tongue as if we have some actual experience with the concept of nothing.  I guess it flows from our very human and limited experience of bicycles not popping into existence and Boltzmann brains being nothing more than words on paper.  \n\nWilliam Lane Craig - one of the most well known Christian apologists uses the argument that 'nothing can come from nothing' on a regular basis.  Actually, so does Frank Turek and so does Dinesh D'Souza.  I suppose the simplistic nature of the argument is what makes it so appealing. After all, as humans living in a universe we have no experience of something coming from nothing.   On the other hand, we seem quite comfy to speak of infinity as if it's any less mysterious.  It's a strange paradox.\n\nThe thing is that when you consider what 'nothing' is in greater detail you get stuck. At least if you take an honest, atheistic approach to the question you do.\n\nWhen you talk about 'nothing' in the concept of pre-universe (and this is already incoherent as how can there be a 'pre' when there was no time)  you have to talk about\n\n- no energy\n- no matter\n- no photons\n- no gravity\n- no time\n- no geometry\n\nAsk a child what they think *nothing* is and you'll probably get some answer about space - a vacuum with little or no gravity.  \n\nBut that's not even the beginning of nothingness.  There's still space there.  There's still time there, there's still light as the photons from a sun pass through on their way to... somewhere?  True nothing has no space as it has no geometry.  It has no time.\n\nI think that when most of us think of 'nothing' and when biblical claims of the 'nothingness' from which the universe was created are discussed they're *really* talking about the more *casual* nothingness that we bandy about in discussions of interstellar space as that's really the closest thing any of us can relate to 'nothing'.  But that's not really nothing in a scientific or physical sense of the word.  It's more like the nothing that exists when you close your eyes.\n\nBut when you try to really get yourself to a state of nothing (if that can even be said as 'state' implies a temporal condition and nothing would be devoid of time) how do you even begin?  \n\nAnd even if you could somehow get yourself to 'nothing' how then do you add a god that exists out of time, and out of space when those two notions are inconsistent with the notion of nothing to start with.\n\nI think a better question, in my opinion, for a theist to answer is not how something can come from nothing but rather how they can even consider that there could be 'nothing'.  Without a nothing there's really nothing for their creator to create. Rather, instead of a creator we'd have a remodeller or rearranger.  Not quite as impressive a title\n",

        "text": "I was recently in a discussion with a theist who sent me a link to this page claiming to prove his claims.\n\n\"I will prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (hereafter referred to as “God”) created “the heavens and the earth” in six literal days.\"\n\nI would be very interested to hear your thoughts on these arguments as I am having trouble sorting through the bunk in his logic rhetoric.\n\nhttp://www.heartlandforensic.com/writing/chapter-0-introduction\n\nUPDATE: I printed out all damn 43 pages and I've been going over it with a pencil for the last two hours. Ugh. Chapter 4 is a clusterfuck of fallacies and false premises. I'm just starting into Chapter 5 now...\n\nUPDATE:\n\n***Outline:***\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNot much of substance here. The author just outlines his goals. One thing of note:\n&gt;Scientists and other intellectuals have answers, but none of these people appears to have a corner on answers that are demonstrably truthful.\n\nThis sentence sets the tone for much of the article. A lot of his discussion is spent trying to show that science can say nothing about the past.\n\n**Chapter 1: Deductive and Inductive Logic**\n\nThe author spends a significant amount of time talking about formal logic in this section. I don't have much problem with this section and, honestly, didn't read it very closely. At the end, he provides a photo of a damaged car and asks the reader to try to figure out what had happened to it.\n\n*Discussion point: Did any of you read this more carefully than I? If so, is his introduction to formal logic actually accurate?*\n\n**Chapter 2: The Scientific Method**\n\n&gt; The past is not observable by scientists living in the present. Only people who were present in a certain place at a certain time and who were sufficiently sentient to observe, remember and record are the only ones who observed the past event. The scientific method relies on scientists to do the observing.\n\n&gt; The past cannot be predicted. Prediction is an activity occurring in the present that looks to the future. Determining what is past through any form of reasoning is simply relying on Q to surmise P--in other words, affirming the consequent. Affirming the consequent does not make it past the hypothesis stage because it is deductively invalid and unsound. The photograph of my friend’s car demonstrated just how poorly we do at \naffirming the consequent for past events.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, one cannot perform experiments on the past. Experimentation involves manipulating P, and scientists cannot manipulate the past, although some may try in vain to \"rewrite history\"--to revise the past in the minds of others!\n\n*Discussion point: What do you think of his arguments for this passage? (Context: Page 10)*\n\n**Chapter 3: The Forensic Scientific Method and the Inferential Test**\n\nThis chapter is started with what comes across as conspiratorial ravings.\n\n&gt; Although the speculations of these men (Darwin, and other scientists) were capable of being falsified and actually have been falsified in many ways, no one seems to want to talk about that. Instead, their untested hypotheses (at least, hypotheses not tested by them) are repeated over and over again and have become the mainstream in thinking among modern scientists and educators. These untested hypotheses have become the new dogma.\n\nA few paragraphs later he commits the anecdotal fallacy again when he goes on another conspiratorial rant about the current state of forensic science and one of his colleagues being discredited.\n\n&gt; Consider the Forensic Scientific Method (FSM). It is summarized as follows:\n\n&gt; 1. Acquisition of primary witness and other anamnestic evidence\n2. Anticipation of future questions\n3. Acquisition of physical evidence\n4. Comparison of consistency of alleged events (hypothesis) with physical findings, obtaining additional data as needed\n5. Assessment only to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, recognizing the limitations of science\n\nLater, he presents his Inferential Test:\n\n&gt; [This document](http://www.heartlandforensic.com/writing/forensic-inference/the-inferential-test-is-always-true-think-of-it-as-a-law) demonstrates that the Inferential Test is a theorem that is always true. Such a demonstration using deductive logic is even better than peer review!\n\nThis seems to demonstrate a lack of understanding of of the purpose for peer review.\n\n*Discussion point: What are your thoughts on his Forensic Scientific Method and Inferential Test? I am particularly interested in the inferential test as it batters one upside the head with formal logic and I don't have the expertise to verify it or debunk it.*\n\n***Chapter 4: Application of the Forensic Scientific Method and the Inferential Test Part 1***\n\n&gt; Even so, we could determine with certainty through circumstantial evidence that God (a name we assign to an intelligent and powerful creator and sustainer) *provides the only plausible explanation for the creation and the sustenance of the heavens and the earth.*\n\nThis is where my real facepalms began. He seems blissfully ignorant of what modern cosmology has to say about origins of the universe (Inflation) and Newton's laws of motion (Object in motion stays in motion).\n\nHe later rips on the Intelligent Design people by saying they don't go far enough (Literal creation week).\n\n&gt; First of all, the argument ignores witness accounts that exist for these past events (to be covered in the next chapter). Secondly, not only does there have to be intelligence to design the system called \"the heavens and the earth\" but there also has to be *power* introduced into the system not only to *create* the system but also to *order and sustain* it.\n\nThis whole chapter is full of things which are only partially true or are outright false.\n\n&gt; God created the heavens and the earth10 if and only if all things are possible with God.\n\nThis fails with the introduction of omnipotence as the definition is self refuting. If he had actually used the term \"omnipotence\" then we could at least give him the benefit of the doubt and let it slide. However, he instead elected to say \"all things are possible\" which is not true.\n\n&gt; 1. Assume that there is no God.\n2. If there is no God, then the universe came to be by the Big Bang scenario (that is why the scenario was invented--to explain the origin of the universe without God causing it).\n3. If the universe came to be by the Big Bang scenario, then the laws of physics were suspended (How does nothing become so dense that it becomes something that explodes?).\n4. If the laws of physics were suspended, then a miracle was performed.\n5. If a miracle was performed, then there is a God (A \"miracle\" is \"a surprising and welcome event that is not explicable by natural or scientific laws and is therefore considered to be the work of a divine agency”).\n\n&gt; ∴ There is a God.\n\nPremise 2, 3, and 5 are false. For someone who spent so much time discussing formal logic, this is dismally poor use of it.\n\n&gt; 1. If one believes Theistic Evolution is correct, then one accepts both the existence of God and the truth of Darwinian (or Neo-Darwinian) Evolution.\n2. If one believes Darwinian (or Neo-Darwinian) Evolution to be true, then one accepts the non-existence of God (That was the whole point of the scenario when Darwin first proposed it: to explain the existence of life as we know it without the existence of God).\n\n&gt; ∴ Theistic Evolution is not correct.\n\nPremise 2 is false. This argument relies on a false definition of evolution.\n\n*Discussion point: I'm not sure that there is much to discuss here. The actual arguments he presented were trivially simple to show as false.*\n\n***Chapter 5: Application of the Forensic Scientific Method and the Inferential Test, Part 2***\n\nIn this chapter, the author attempts to show that we have reliable witnesses for the events of the first five books of the Bible. He seems unaware of the Documentary Hypothesis and its support or perhaps just dismisses it because they used evil science.\n\nThe first thing he does is link to a dead site which is now a plastic surgery blog. Whoops. Needless to say, I did not read it carefully.\n\nThis chapter includes several things he counts as evidence which are patently absurd and false.\n\n&gt; 9. The inability for us to do what is right even though we know the right thing to do as a recurrent theme in both history and our present condition (The Fall).\n\nWell fuck you too, bud. Speak for yourself.\n\n&gt; At this point, as a forensic scientist, I could state, under oath and to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the ancient account is sufficient to explain (\"consistent with\") present-day empirical and physical evidence and that there are no inconsistencies.\n\nDamn. This guy is a loon.\n\n*Discussion point: What are your thoughts on his list of \"evidence\"? I could use extra sources for demonstrating the bunk.*\n\nThat's the end of chapter 5. I don't have time to complete the last chapters right now but I'll try to get back later this morning.",

        "text": "Allow me to explain.\n\nReligions, in many ways, have existed as long as we have. Initially, they were rudimentary and easy to convey from father to son. In relation to today's complex, storied religions, they're very much like \"single cells\" as opposed to today's \"organisms\". What I find really interesting though, is how they adapted and grew.\n\nDifferent religions have had different methods for survival. Whether it was aggressive growth, evangelism, occultism, or infesting power systems, they've all had different ways that they have survived and propagated. They've also had to change with changing circumstances. The Christianity of 1000 AD was especially effective at spreading itself, but that method doesn't work in 2000 AD. It's forced to re-evaluate, change its approach, and adapt to a new environment. It also provides something other religions don't, an easy path to salvation, eternal reward. This is the kind of \"angler light\" it dangles out to lure more people, then keeping them in place through threats of hell and torment.\n\nOver the millenia, smaller religions have been gobbled up by the larger ones, whether do to less attractive doctrines, inability to convert powerful people, inability to convert the masses, etc.\n\nMeanwhile in the east, these predators didn't appear to exist. There aren't any Abrahamic equivalents to smash and gobble up other religions, and so they followed a different evolutionary path, creating Buddhism, (Which then became many different kinds of Buddhism as it adapted to new areas), Hinduism, Taoism, Shintoism, etc. By the time Christianity made it to these far places, the systems were entrenched enough that one wolf couldn't possibly eat *all* the deer, though it would often make headway in spreading.\n\nToday, we've even had new religions pop up. Scientology propagates by feeding on the ennui of the rich and powerful. Buddhism, thanks to the more relaxed predatory nature of current day Christianity, has managed to snake into the cracks of western society and create this more \"rational\" Western Buddhism.\n\nI don't know if this comes across as rambling or if I'm not the first person to think this, but I think the \"evolution of organizations\" is a really interesting subject.",

You're the first person I've ever spoken to who's been this confused.\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; You defined atheism as a \"lack of belief in gods\".\n\n&gt; That definition is fundamentally incompatible with agnosticism. An agnostic does not have a lack of belief in gods. An agnostic believes that it might be possible, but he would just never know about it.\n\n&gt; The definitions are as mutually exclusive as \"heterosexual\", \"homosexual\" and \"asexual\". If you're asexual, you're not on either side of the spectrum. You might lean towards another (heteroromantic, homoromantic), but you'll never be a heterosexual or homosexual.\n\n&gt; If you're an agnostic, you are not a theist or an atheist. The proof for either conclusion is unavailable to you, therefore you stay out of it.\n\n&gt; To say you don't believe in gods is to say you're an atheist.

I derive this view from religion. If religion is false, then this intrinsic meaningfulness is called into question. (here religion is false=atheism, but I would be happy to get a deist's opinion as well)\n\n\nEDIT: I guess I feel that moral nihilism is the most reasonable response to no God; morals are completely arbitrary and subjective. \n\n\nYour viewpoint: ?\n\nWhat I want to know is, why do you value your own values? your own opinions? if you don't believe in this intrinsic meaningfulness (I don't know what the range of philosophical beliefs in TrueAtheism is in relation to this)  I'm not going to argue, I just want to know your thought process in relation to giving meaningfulness to your own opinions.\n\nTo summarise:\nYou have subjective value (meaningfulness) of life. However, you also have subjective value **of** your subjective values. You value your opinions, thoughts and feelings. You obviously value them highly; you are placing every action and behaviour upon them. Why? What makes you trust/accept/validate your opinions?

It looks like she's gonna pass soon and he's had to cancel a few plans with me. I'm okay with the fact that he wants to be with his mother and I've shown nothing but understanding towards him. I can only imagine what he's going through at this point and I want to be as understanding and supportive as possible. In order to do that, I told him 'whatever you need, let me know. I'll do my best to support you in this tough time'. He only asked me to pray for his family. I don't really know how to respond to that because I am atheist. I don't believe in god nor do I believe praying is helpful in any way. I don't want to provide false hope, that would only hurt the situation more. At the same point, I don't want to argue with him because I know that would be just as bad as providing false hope. So I'm unsure how to respond to him. If I say 'your family is in my prayers' not only would I be lying because I don't pray, but I'd be providing false hope. Concurrently, it would be rude and inappropriate to argue with him and say 'Praying is useless, but I'll throw my bananas at a tree for you since that's just as helpful' or whatever. Even if I found a nice way to say I don't pray I think that would only put more on his mind. What can I say that doesn't betray my morals yet also doesn't add more stress to the situation?",
