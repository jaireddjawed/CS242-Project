        "text": "I hooked up with classmate, but now I want more\n\nWe are both 22 and in our last semester of university. We are also the same major and have multiple classes together. We didn't know each other prior to this school year, but she caught my eye right away. Unfortunately, she was in a LTR, so I did not overstep that boundary when interacting with her. I found right away that not only did I love the way she looked, but I also loved her personality. We were on such a similar vibe; it felt almost surreal considering I am extremely picky. Maybe she's just super personable, but I rarely feel those types of genuine connections (let alone at a \"friendly\" level). Considering she was in a relationship, I kept my distance for obvious reasons. Keep in mind that every guy in my classes also finds her extremely attractive.\n\nFast forward to this winter (between semesters), she broke up with her boyfriend (I think of 4 years). I know this because she told me at a bar (we kissed that night). From this point on (mid-January), she showed moderate interest in me. I would always walk with her to the gym after class, but nothing ever escalated to anything beyond friendly interactions and mild banter. She would often say that everyone in class thinks I'm attractive and we even grabbed a drink at a bar one night. That same night, however, she proceeded to flirt with multiple good-looking guys she seemed familiar with at the bar. Because of this, I left early without her and pretty much took this as rejection going forward. It was disappointing, but I took it for what I perceived it to be. \n\nI don’t know how it got brought up, but her and another friend at one point asked me if I wanted a girlfriend and I told them no (because what kind of question is that?).\n\nA couple of weeks later, some classmates (her included) and I went out to get some drinks at a bar. This time around, the vibe was very different. She was extremely flirtatious the whole night and very quickly into the night asked me if \"we were just friends.\" I responded that I didn't think so, and she immediately invited me back to her place and we hooked up. It happened so fast and I can definitely say we both enjoyed the experience. It felt like we had been together prior; I ended up staying the night and she fell asleep on my chest. I left in the morning and she gave me a kiss goodbye.\n\nSince then, it has gone back to much of the same as before. When we interact I get a friendly vibe and not much more and she rarely puts herself in my space (doesn't text me, go out of her way to chat, etc.). I invited her to come to my place a couple of days later to chill, which she agreed to, but later flaked on. She had a legitimate excuse but nevertheless, she has not expressed high interest since hooking up. \n\nLong story short, every girl who *really* has liked me has given me far more interest than this. They'll text me, ask me to meet up with them, or outright ask me on a date. Is it possible that some girls just hookup with guys and completely move on with nothing more to follow? If I'm being honest, I crushed on her hard before we hooked up and now it's amplified. She is super awesome to be with, we have similar interests, we are going to have the same exact job when we leave college, etc. Yes, I would be interested in pursuing a relationship with her, but I simply do not know where we stand anymore. I have not texted her since she flaked a week ago and we are now on break.\n\nI would ask her on a formal date, but I don't want to make it awkward between us in the final month or so of college. I simply don't know if she would accept one. I could ask her in the final days of the semester, but then I risk her getting asked out by someone else before me in between then... maybe she doesn't want a relationship?? I honestly don't even know anymore.\n\nAnyways, I know this was a jumble of a post, but how do you think I should proceed? She obviously liked me enough to ask me to hookup with her, so what might I be missing? Do I just shoot my shot and say screw it?\n\ntl;dr: hooked up with classmate after knowing her for a couple months, now I don’t know where we stand and I want more from our relationship.",

        "text": "Hi guys. I would like some advice on this one because my partner (26m) and I (25f) have been dating for almost 3 years and lately he’s been discussing the idea of settling down with me.\n\nHowever, there was one thing that happened when we were 9 months into the relationship. He had recently moved to my city to be with me. We wanted to spend time together that summer but unfortunately, my entire family got sick with COVID.\n\nWe were at home for at least 2 weeks and my mother is highly immunocompromised so the family decided that we wouldn’t go out until the vaccine was available in my country. (We are from Asia)\n\nHe got a little frustrated because he just moved to the city and I couldn’t see him. His job also restricted them from coming to the office so he was basically alone in his apartment. Perhaps loneliness got to him and “drove him crazy.” One day during our extended self-imposed quarantine, he needed to borrow my headphones for his job training. So I rushed to his apartment but didn’t stay, just gave him the headphones.\n\nHe used that single event during our argument later on about his frustration about me not being able to go out. He said, “you could rush to let me borrow headphones but you couldn’t find a way to see me again?” I explained to him that it would be unfair to my family if I went out needlessly because I did not want to expose them to the virus. He got more frustrated. What he meant by “finding a way” was for me to get back the headphones he borrowed because 1) he was done using it; 2) that was a “way” for us to see each other again. I told him that could wait until my mother was feeling better. Then he got angry. This is the part I could never forget. \n\nHe said, “I already did my part for our relationship. I moved here to be with you. When in truth, there are plenty of girls in my city. Right?” That “Right?” sent me. He continued, “But I love you, so I’m here. I’ve done my part. Do yours.” He slammed the call to an end and refused to talk to me for 3 days.\n\nThat time, I felt so bad and blamed myself for not being able to go out. I also blamed COVID. I ultimately validated him.\n\nFast forward 2 years later, I couldn’t forget the words he said to me. He got better at handling conflict but he couldn’t lose the “who’s right” or “who’s winning this argument” attitude. To him, an argument couldn’t be settled without a winner. To me, it could be resolved with a reasonable discussion.\n\nNow that he wants to talk about settling down, I cannot stop thinking about that incident. Did he seriously gaslight me by saying he could have been with other girls but was stuck with me in my city?\n\nI know it’s a bit late for me to realize that he did gaslight me but at least I am aware now. The rose-colored glasses fell off the moment he talked about settling down.\n\nGuys, is it okay to ask him that I might need some time to think about whether I would like to move forward in our relationship? Because I honestly couldn’t picture myself. Suddenly I realized he was only doing the bare minimum. He couldn’t even plan dates, forgets special occasions, and whenever I raise a concern his response is always: “I have so much to think about and you want to add?” On our dates, he couldn’t be bothered to dress nicely or match my outfit (literally just shorts and sandals), but on his boys’ nights out, he is nicely dressed. \n\nHe’s in graduate school and so am I. We both work. I get being busy and tired. But I also don’t think I should be the only one carrying the mental load.\n\nTl;dr my partner wants to settle down but something that happened almost 2years ago is holding me back.",

        "text": " TLDR; very serious bf left me for his ex girlfriend and referenced HIMYM\n\nHi all, just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nI was recently left by my boyfriend of almost 1 year, very serious, to me and seemingly to him anyway. We were doing great, nothing out of the ordinary had happened, we were just living life.\n\nThen one day when he was supposed to be home by 5, he didn't show up and didn't respond to my messages asking where he was. I asked him again at 7 and he said sorry hon something came up, I'll see you later tn. So I just waited for him to come home not knowing what had happened.\n\nWhen he did get home, he sat down by the door with the groceries he had promised to bring by and was silent. I asked him what happened to which he didn't respond. He said he was really hungry, at this point it was midnight, and he hadn't eaten dinner I'd guessed. So I said I'll heat the leftovers, the leftovers I had made waiting for him to come home. I then tried to give him a kiss which he brushed off, and I found very weird.\n\nAfter I heated the food and he had eaten, in silence, I asked him again what happened today?\n\nThen he proceeded to fumble over his words, asking what I had thought happened, to which I responded I have no idea.\n\nThen he decides to break the news by saying, remember how Ted got left at the alter? I am Stella.\n\nMind you I had introduced him to the show and we watched all of it together.\n\nAt this point my heart sank. I asked him exactly what happened and he had the gall to say give me some time to tell you. He proceeds to tell me how his ex girlfriend whom he had not spoken to for almost 3 years called him out of the blue today in the afternoon. I asked why he picked up as this act in itself was already a sign of betrayal to me. He told me after they talked on the phone for a while they met up and continued to talk about their future. After that was when he came home to me to tell me he is choosing her.\n\nWe had obviously talked about our past relationships and he did tell me that she was very special to him and they broke up because of her family medical history, high chance of cancer, bad genes, family members with schizo ect, and his mom initially really liked her but after finding all this out she didn't support their relationship, tensions grew high and other stuff eventually came up and built on their breakup. This was 3 years ago and he assured me over and over throughout the relationship that he was over this and me and him were the future.\n\nThe entire time he was telling me this I was moving getting his stuff ready to move out and he tried to keep his cool and be collected, making me question whether he was even sorry for his actions.\n\nAt the very end when he was moving the last of his stuff he broke down on the ground and sobbed looking at me saying he was so sorry, to which I had nothing left to say and left.\n\nThe worst feeling throughout all of this is knowing after that, he went right to her and they get to be happy while I was treated like collateral damage and thrown away like hot garbage.",

        "text": "I (20f) met a guy (19m) early last year on a course and he started flirting with me back then, got a girlfriend shortly after. They dated for about 6 months then broke up and shortly after he reached out to me in November while he was in Australia. Since then we consistently spoke for around 4 months and overtime my feelings grew for him, and it seemed like his did too. He’s coming back here from his trip in May, and in our conversations he made a lot of references to the future, saying things like how he wanted to meet up with me for coffee when he’s back, how he wanted to get me a snack from australia, how his family and friends would like me (making it seem like i’d meet them), etc. And last week things seemed to be going better than ever between us, and I was genuinely looking forward to seeing him once he gets back. \n\nHowever, on Tuesday he was honest with me about the fact that a girl asked him out and he wanted to go on a date with her, and that he made it clear to her he can’t date anyone while he’s there and he said she’s fine with that. He also said it may ‘lead to more’ but that it ‘doesn’t matter’, i guess because it won’t turn into a real relationship. He also said I was on his mind a lot last week but because he couldn’t physically see me it made him want to say yes to the date with the girl who asked him out even more. \n\nI also noticed he hid his Instagram story from me when he reposted a girl going bowling with him, and since then I haven’t been able to see any of his stories. \n\nThis made me pretty uncomfortable. We haven’t officially dated but I was under the impression that we would, and this situation also felt like it was out of character for him. \n\nSo in my response to him I basically said I wasn’t really interested in talking to him anymore, even when he comes back here, but I wish him the best. \n\nHe said he respects my decision but still would like to see me when he’s back. I didn’t respond and since then we haven’t spoken.\n\nI guess I’ve started to overthink the situation and I’m now wondering if I was in the wrong for pretty much breaking things off for this reason? Or was it a valid thing to be upset about?\n\n\n————————————————————\n\nTLDR : I’ve been speaking to a guy who I met last year and is currently on a trip abroad but is coming back here in May. I assumed we’d start dating when he came back because of how interested we both seemed in eachother (we consistently spoke for 4 months), but on Tuesday he told me a girl asked him out on a date and he said he’ll go. He expressed to her he can’t get in a relationship while he’s there and said she’s fine with it, but that it could ‘lead to more’ with her from the date. But he said this wouldn’t matter, I guess because he’s coming back here. However, this made me uncomfortable and I told him I don’t really wanna talk to him anymore, even when he’s back here. He said he respects my decision but would still wanna see me when he’s back. I didn’t respond and he haven’t spoken since. I’m just wondering if this was a valid reason for me to be upset and break things off?",

        "text": "So me and my gf have been dating for a year and a half now. In just under a year from now, she and her family plan to go on a vacation and she wants me to come. I would honestly love to go but there are a few issues. \n\nI live alone in my own place and make just enough to keep my head above water. I am very frugal and like to save money. I save it for retirement as well as investing so I can make more money to keep myself afloat. I certainly have the funds but I am not the type to blow it all on a vacation. I prefer to spend extra money on nice dinners occasionally or a movie out. The little things. It costs around 2 grand for just me alone to go. I’m also introverted and am not a big fan of crowds or loud noises. \n\nMy gf doesn’t like to save money but plans to do so for the trip.  She believes in the idea of if you got money you should spend it because yolo and money for memories is important to her. She lives with her family and is able to save up money for the vacation. She also keeps trying to convince me and wants me to just use up what she calls a tiny portion of my hard earned savings to go with her. She and her family are travelers, they love traveling and going places. I am not. \n\nI love this girl and I’d love to go. But I’m forced to recognize we have different values and goals in life and I’m not starting to wonder if we are truly right for each other. I think I should go both because I’d like to and it would be good for our relationship but I’m worried what might happen between then and now, such as us breaking up. Any advice would be helpful. \n\nTl;dr: I don’t know if I want to go on vaca with my gf because it is expensive and I am having doubts.",

Shocked, I implored him to be my usher as he was one of my oldest friends. He begrudgingly agreed, but has brought it up again recently how he doesn't want to be my usher. \n\nHis reasoning is that he said my future brother and sister in law were rude to him at a party we all went to recently. He told me what they said and they were very mild comments and I think he totally over-reacted. \n\nI suspect something else is at play. He is the jealous type and has a bit of a drinking problem. He tends to get very emotional when drunk and at big events so I suspect this is why he wants to take a back seat at the wedding but I can't be sure.\n\nStrangely enough, he has moved in two doors down from my fiancé and I two months ago so I am getting very mixed messages from him. \n\nI am going to tell him I think it's best that he doesn't be an usher because it's a day about myself and my fiancé and I don't want this unnecessary drama.\n\nI am still confused by his reasoning and also deeply hurt that my oldest friend doesn't want to be an usher. What does everyone else think?\n\nTL;DR; : Friend doesn't want to be my usher",

        "text": "TL:DR \n\nSo Myself (M18) and my Girlfriend (F18) were dating officially for just over a month, but we had been super close for about 5 months. Anyways it’s the day before her 18th birthday and I message her saying I want to take her out for breakfast, she only responds with “mmm I’ll have to wake up too early”, that’s it. This really shocked me as I thought it would’ve been a real nice thing to do, BUT I thought ok if she doesn’t want to go out that’s cool, no hard feelings. The next day I text her happy birthday - no response. Strange. I phone her multiple times- she doesn’t pick up. Now I’m thinking this is quite weird and get a bit worried, so I text “hey *her name*, hope everything’s ok and hope you are having a great day”. She responds 6 hours later with “sorry I didn’t have my phone”. That’s the last thing I hear from her for the next 10 days. Turns out that she had left home on the morning of her 18th birthday and never returned. Her single mother and brother had no idea where she was or if she was safe.\n\nOver those 10 days I continue to message and phone her, a lot - all to no response. Around the 3rd day I start to get real worried so I text some of her friends (which I have never met btw) and ask if they have seen or heard from her. Turns out that most of them had texted/phoned her on her birthday and she had responded !!! I was relieved to hear that she was alive but this was also really puzzling as myself and her never had any problems or arguments and I couldn’t think of why she was avoiding me. Anyways a few more days pass by, still no response from her as I continued to message and phone her daily . Her mother and brother also still didn’t know where she was at this point.\n\nIt gets to around day 7 and I’m now getting quite annoyed at her for not responding, however my texts to her are still very nice and concerned about her safety . I had also found out that she hadn’t missed a single UNI class and that she was back to messaging all her friends like normal. I start to write a break up message as I realise that if she doesn’t even respect me enough to send me ONE text saying that she’s ok, or literally anything , then I don’t think we can be in a relationship.\n\nAnyways I write the message and send it to her on day 8. 2 days pass and she still hasn’t even opened it. Then randomly on day 11 she messaged me , “sorry for not contacting you, had a lot to deal with but I thought you would’ve been more understanding and given me more time . Please stop messaging my friends”. That’s it . That’s all she had to say after 5 months of being best friends. Then she blocked me on all platforms. Bro I was so mad, I wanted to do bad things. I felt gaslit. How could she take NO RESPONSIBILITY for essentially ruining our relationship, and then try to shift the blame to me saying I should’ve given her ‘’more time” like 10 days isn’t enough. Beyond pissed off I was, but I think I dodged a bullet by getting out fairly early.\n\n***DO YOU THINK I MESSED UP, OR DID I DODGE A BULLET?***",

I don’t think she loves me anymore, and hasn’t for at least a year. \n\nIs “why do you love me?” “how do you love me?” too hard of questions to answer? I mean I can answer it very easily… her not so much… I don’t even know where to start. she comes home from school and then I’m supposed to live there while she’s there every weekend for the last 2 years. despite it being a decently longer drive to work on workdays… she’s slept at my house maybe one time in the last year at least… the same girl who used to live in my room until I got home from work… energy anywhere isn’t matched. She wants a date night and it includes going out spending spending spending, while she of course doesn’t have the money. then it’s my fault we don’t have “enough” date nights enough despite her contributing nothing. The little shit too. Want a snack in bed? I’ll end up getting my own but the second it’s her… like she literally can’t say she helps in any department of a relationship. She gets mad we don’t text enough during the week and then spends all weekend on her phone… the only way she could say she shows me any type of love is when she cooks… and that comes with my helping and doing dishes… then we are a 50/50 relationship she loves. We won’t even talk about all the shit I gladly did for her mother. From redoing her front porch, taking care of her yard all summer, and just the little repairs. I also wasn’t good enough for that (LOL). Just when I have complaints it’s an issue. Idk what I’m looking for now… sound ridiculous reading this… extremely clear again she doesn’t love me.\n\nTLDR: felt like an idiot writing this, and feels clear now... but is “why/ how do you love me?” an unfair question to ask someone you have been with for 5 years? and then to not answer it???",

I have brought up several times to reach out if they need help or someone to talk to already as well, but sometimes it takes a few days to respond.\n\nAt what point do you just give them the space, or should I just try and be present still and try and keep it light hearted?

        "text": "Sorry so long.... didn't really expect that.\n\n\nAbout 6 months ago I (38f) started to awaken sexually. I'm in my late 30s. My whole life I have seen porn as a thing my spouse (38m) used because I failed and wasn't able to satisfy him. I had a long conversation with him about this and how an interest has been sparked in me and that I want to experiment with it. My spouse and I have been together for almost 20 years. The whole time I have gotten very hurt every time I have found they used porn, because again, made me feel like a complete failure and insignificant. We started to have long conversations about it and I started to research further. I still have big feelings around it but feel it is getting better, but it is slow. It has only been maybe three months since our first conversation. \n\n\nI told him I wanted to start enjoying it together and that I am trying to retrain my brain to not let these things bother me. I said this will take a lot of uncomfortable conversations and can't promise to do it completely correctly everytime because I do still have the betrayal scars from the past. He said he understood and was willing to join me on this journey.\n\n\nThings have been going ok, I have had a few set backs, but overall progressing in the direction I want to be in, and building a more sex positive and fun sex experience for both of us. Many times we have enjoyed porn together. My body fully reacting to it is a very positive way.\n\n\nLast night I was a great ass and don't know how to reset. We typically skip off in the evening to enjoy each other before we start our late evening activities, he is usually up working or playing games until 2 or 3. I wasn't feeling well last night and told him I was going to nap from 10 to 1, in hopes of feeling better and being able to enjoy ourselves around 1 just before we collapse in bed for the night. I woke up at about 11 and he was looking at porn. I told him, hey don't forget our plans for later. He said he just had his hand in his pants, not actually doing anything and just looking. I said cool and went back to sleep. \n\n\nI woke up again at 1240, 20 minutes before we were supposed to head to bed and he was full on going at it on the couch next to me. I seriously got my feelings hurt. I stormed off to the bathroom and came back asking him if he can please explain this to me because I don't understand when we had plans for just a few minutes from now. He said he had too much to drink and just needed to Rev his engine before we went off. I understood what he meant, but felt I still needed to talk through my feelings to fully understand them and be able to retrain myself for next time. He didn't like that. He was livid. Telling me I was a liar and how dare I tell him it is ok if it isn't. I tried to explain that this was a whole new situation,  that we haven't had an instance that I found him using porn immediately before we were intimate, so it made me feel inadequate again. He said I told him porn was fine just to trap him and yell at him.\n\n\nI apologized for my over reaction, as it is not how I want to react, and  tried to explain to him, again, that I understand his need in this now that he explain it to me me and that my feelings were irrational triggers from the previous trauma and that I told him this would potentially happen while I was working through this. He just kept calling me a liar and telling me to fuck off.\n\n\nI don't know why I'm typing this. He said he was game for this transition. I warned him I might not be able to handle my feelings this early in the process, but it seems to still not matter. I know I over reacted, but I was really hoping for some more understanding and patience from him as I work through these ingrained feelings and emotions. I feel I have come an insanely long was in the 3 months. He thinks I haven't done enough.\n\n\nTLDR: Trying to change my feelings around porn and build a better sex positive relationship with my husband. Told him it would take difficult conversations and over reactions on my part as we progress through this and he agreed to do it with me. First big fight about it, finding him using porn 20 minutes before we said we were gonna go fool around, made me feel inadequate, and he just called me a liar and to fuck off because I'm not ok with porn like I said I was. Even though we have had numerous very positive experience with porn over this time.",

        "text": "I met this girl about a year and a half ago. At the time she was in a relationship, but was obviously not happy. Due to our newfound intimacy, she eventually ended their relationship. Unfortunately at the time, I did not want anything serious with this girl do to the fact she cheated on her ex with me. \n\nAfter distancing myself for a while, she entered another relationship. At the time all I heard from her close circle was how obsessed she was with me and how she couldn’t stop talking about me. This of course reeled me back in and i’m sure you can guess how her second relationship ended. \n\nShe has left 2 relationships because of me and has told me i’m the only one she’s ever wanted. I’ve never met someone who is so infatuated with me. As you can assume, I eventually entered a relationship with her because of this. It has only been a few months, but there remains a consistent issue. My trust.\n\nAs crazy as it sounds, I truly don’t think she would betray me, but I cannot ignore her track record. When I see another guy in her snapchat, or her talking to another guy, it creates a sense of discomfort. She has let me go thru her phone and I found nothing incriminating other than guys attempting to flirt but to no avail. \n\nOne thing that has really stunted my growth in trusting her is the fact that she doesn’t post me on her main social medias. She’ll show me on her private accounts but never her main. When I brought this up to her, she mentioned how she didn’t want her mother or sister knowing that she was in another relationship, which at the time I understood. Her family is now aware of our relationship after a recent trip, so i’m waiting to see if things change regarding her “showing me off”. (keep in mind, all i do is post her all the time, i love showing her off)\n\nIs this relationship something worth trusting?\nHow can I fight against my urge to not trust a single thing she says or does?\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend left two previous relationships to be with me. Can our relationship be trusted?",

        "text": "A few years ago, my wife and I took the love language test. We found out that hers is acts of service while mine is quality time, so ever since then I’ve been making a concerted effort to “speak” her love language along with the more traditional ways of showing love in a relationship.\n\nShe’s recently (in the past year) been dealing with some depression. She’s working on it with her doctor and we are in couples counseling. It’s been a long and difficult journey for both of us. I do not suffer from depression. \n\nOver this last year we’ve also changed work shifts, so we have been getting home at the same time everyday. Before, we were both free to kind of spend our own time independent during the week and then make time for each other on the weekends. \n\nHere is where I’m struggling. The things I do as acts of service are starting to become expectations. For example, instead of both of us cleaning up after dinner I would jump up and take her plate, clean all the dishes and clean up our kitchen. Or, I would say go ahead and sit down I will prepare dinner. Not a huge deal because I like to cook. But now, when she is finished eating she just leaves her plate. I’ve tested this by leaving my own plate, if I don’t pick them up they’ll just stay there.  Another example is making her lunches for work. It went from something I did to ease her mental workload in the morning, to something she will mention if I stop “you haven’t made my lunch once this week”. We also have a very active dog who I mainly take care of. She needs walks 5 times a week, and I can’t remember the last time she took her while I stayed home relaxing. \n\nHer whole life she was hounded by her mother to be clean, tidy and organized, to the point of stress and depression. Now I feel like she is taking a breath because I don’t yell at her to clean up after herself, but it’s putting the strain on me. It’s hard for her too because it makes her feel lazy. She knows she’s not typically this type of person. I just don’t know how to mention this delicately since she is very sensitive to the topic. For example, if someone outside of our relationship were to ask, she would still say she does 50% of the work when it’s more like 80/20. \n\nI don’t want my relationship to become a scorekeeping debate. I don’t mind picking up the slack while she manages her depression but I need to know there is some end in sight. Right now it feels like the list of responsibilities is growing and the recognition is shrinking.\n\nTLDR: my  responsibilities in the household are increasing due to wife’s depression, I am worried this has become the new normal",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I (M33) would like to tell you a story that happened to me, and to have your opinion. I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (F29) for almost 7 years. \n\nAt this time we love each other and we are the same on many points. \n\nAbout four years ago, we met couples with whom we became friends, not friends either. In this group there was a friend of mine that I already knew before. Everything was going pretty well. Me and my girlfriend had more affinity with a couple in particular, with whom we went more frequently, especially one summer when we were there quite often. They were nice but their couple was going bad. She hadn't worked for 6 years and he resented her for that, it showed. She was in secret contact with a \"friend\" who sent her pictures of him half naked. \nIt was weird but honestly, we also loved going to their place because they had a super cute and adorable little girl.\n\n\nLooking back, I know today that this guy had his sights on my girlfriend. He often teased her, confided in her, and one thing that stood out to me was when he gave her advice on how to come more easily in bed. (I know I'm a first class moron). In short, concretely I let this guy flirt with my girlfriend in front of my eyes without saying anything. I need to work on my self confidence. \n\nOne day, at the end of the summer, my girlfriend tells me that she thinks she has feelings for the man in question. She doesn't know what to think anymore. She assures me that nothing ever happened, which I believe. Anyway, she wants to be honest with me. For his part, the man leaves his girlfriend with whom he had a child. The breakup is announced to the group of friends, and the bizarre story that happened between them is revealed to group. \n\nI should have seen it coming because one day, this guy boasted of having broken up a couple before leaving where he came from.\n\nFor my part, I take time for myself and take an apartment quickly to put some distance between me and my girlfriend, thinking of breaking up with her, as well as with this group of friends because I'm ashamed of what happened. I'm a little stunned. I felt a lot of hatred from our group towards my girlfriend while the man in question received support, even compassion. I did not receive a single message from the friend with whom I was closest in this group, which I experienced a little badly I admit. While he kept in touch with the other guy and told him it didn't change anything, blah blah. \n\nBrief. I also felt hatred for my girlfriend, for letting feelings develop. I've somewhat cut off ties with this group of friends since then, who didn't even try to contact me (except for one that I don't count in the story). The one I thought I was closest to never asked how I was doing, only his girlfriend texted me to invite me to Christmas or special occasions.\n\n For my part, I took my independence vis-à-vis my girlfriend to whom I told that she could do what she wanted, that she was free to leave. She refused, continued to want to see me whenever she had the chance. \n\nI still love her and we didn't break up, we moved in together again a year after this story. She has made efforts to leave me the space I need, she listens to my needs. I give her a chance. \n\nLast point, I've always been someone with little perspective on a situation and I tend to let myself be carried away by things. I know, it's not very good\n\n\n\nThis is my story. \n\nAm I right to want to cut ties a little with these people who sided with the man who flirted with my girlfriend for months when she chose to cut things of and tell me the truth before something happens?\n\nAm I right to give my girlfriend a chance? \n\n\nThank you for reading this, really thank you. \n\nPs: sorry for my English, I did my best.\n\nTdlr : my girlfriend had feelings for another, confessed to me.",

Most of the time when we do try, we end up having to stop because she doesn’t feel anything or it hurts her. It usually feels like a burden to have sex too, it takes a lot of warm-up time, etc. Almost to the point where my sex drive naturally goes away before actually getting to it.\n\nThe funny thing is that whenever she drinks alcohol (rarely), she almost instantly wants to have sex. She’s expressed to me that her being unable to feel things comes from her anxiety and her history of trauma, so I guess that’s why the alcohol helps her. I totally understand that, but it’s sometimes difficult for me when I don’t feel sexually desired. She always tells me that she’s attracted to me, but that only goes so far if we aren’t being sexual. Sex was always a huge part of my previous relationships, as I am a physical lover. My girlfriend is more of a verbal lover.\n\nIt also pains me to have to masturbate so often, as I wish I could just share those intimate moments with my lover. As we get older, I also worry about things only getting worse. I sometimes feel like I’m missing out on enjoying my body in a sexual way.\n\nAny advice or tips? We are perfect in every other way…\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend and I of 3 years hardly ever have sex and I often feel undesired or that I’m missing out.",

This led to her getting paid a lot less at the end of the month for 3-4 months. For the first month she asked if we could split the rent and bills 75/25. I agreed for one month but this went on for the full 4 months.

She asked me if I would mind covering 75% of the rent and bills again sicne she will be getting a lot less money this month. This time I asked her why she wouldn't use her savings since she has a rainy day fund which should be for this purpose. She said she doesn't want to dip into her savings since she doesn't want to get to the point where she takes out more than she can put back. I mentioned that if I cover half of her portion then it means I can't save so she is essentially asking me to use my savings to pay the bills instead of her own which I don't think is fair. \n\nShe said I was being unfair to her since it's not her fault work is causing her anxiety.

This had previously never happened before and I figured it might be a shutdown so I just laid close to him in the hopes he’d feel better soon, he didn’t and he didn’t speak to me at all until eventually I started crying. This has become a pattern. \n\nAt first it was infrequent but he’d give me the silent treatment sometimes for days at a time until I finally broke down into tears which is when he’d finally be nice to me. He told me it was because I was too dramatic, he didn’t like my tone of voice, I was too critical etc. So I worked on that, I stopped showing emotions when I talked, I tried to sound polite but unemotional and I tried not to be critical but I still got the silent treatment. \n\nThis has now escalated starting from 3 months ago when he spoke to me about changing our life plans for the future, he wanted to commit, wanted to plan a life with me, house, children etc and asked me for a month to start getting things sorted. I was super excited but soon one month turned to two and two months turned to three without any more mentioned about our future. Every single time I have tried to ask him about it I get the silent treatment, I get told to “be quiet, stop being over dramatic” but now when I cry he’s no longer even nice to me I get told “Stop it you’re doing this to yourself” “Oh my god *rolls eyes*” “go away”\n\nLast week he done it in front of my best friend who after watching this for months snapped, yelled at him about how he treats me awfully which made him cry and I then had to comfort him. \n\nThese past few weeks I’ve been struggling a lot as well, I’ve been in and out of emergency due to a serious medical condition I could die from. My best friend has had a mental breakdown and been put into care, my mum is very unwell and then the whole dragging things out for 3 months by my boyfriend. I texted him saying I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown and I needed him to call me. \n\nHe called me 3 hours later, was normal for 5 mins then as soon as I brought up him being part of the reason I was upset I got the silent treatment for over an hour. I’m literally crying my eyes out over the phone and all I got was grunts, “stop it you’re just working yourself up” “I’m not in the mood to deal with this” and You caused this by attacking me” when I asked if he cared how upset i am all I got was total silence.\n\nI’m starting to feel like these aren’t shutdowns but instead I’m being abused. Thoughts? \n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Been with partner for a couple of years, we’re both autistic, partner constantly gives me the silent treatment.",

We never really meet up anymore and do fun things, we only sleep together when we’re out with friends which doesn’t feel right to me and makes me want to stop being intimate with him. When i ask to hangout he says he’s to busy, but he plans whole weekends with his friends… Last monday i got in discussions with him about this again. I told him i would stop doing all this effort if he gives me nothing. He told me that he didn’t want to change as a person, but that’s not what i’m asking from him and i already told him that he doesn’t need to. Well i stopped texting him and i now haven’t spoken him since then… I don’t really know what to do since i told him i didn’t want a relationship where we don’t talk at all… He told me the relationship wouldn’t end if i stopped acting like that but for me it kinda is. I understand that he doesn’t want to text all day long and i’ve told him that already, but not texting at all doesn’t feel right to me since we also don’t see each other that much.\n\nTL;DR boyfriend doesn’t want to text first or ask to hangout and i’m done with doing it alone and now we don’t talk",

        "text": "TL;DR: Started dating friend who I’ve liked for a while and after a positive start, she told me on the phone not to expect anything or blame her if she friendzones me. \n\nBasically, I (24M) have liked my good friend (24F) for a couple years now which she has been aware of. However, she recently broke up with her boyfriend earlier this year. We have been seeing each other quite a lot and have now been on a couple dates, late night drives and movie nights etc and have I have been staying at hers spending the night cuddling pretty romantically in bed. Yesterday, I spent the night after we had gone on a small date and we kissed for the first time and done a lot of it. I spoke to her on the phone just there and we acknowledged things were going fast, which is kind of crazy but we’re enjoying it so we wanna just let it flow. However she said that she doesn’t want me to expect anything to come from this and not to blame her it down the line she decides she doesn’t want anything. I know that this is pretty normal, but I’m not sure why she had to keep saying it to me, it seemed like a weird reminder and that I might be getting led on or even like it’s a warning of friendzoning me.. if she likes me and it’s going well then why would that be what you’re thinking of? it’s obvious there are feelings there but I just can’t get my mind off her having to say these things to me. I told her I just wanna keep enjoying seeing her and let things flow naturally with no pressure. What do you guys think? What’s my best course of action to not fuck things up? Maybe take a step back and let her speak to me when she wants? We plan to go for our first proper date with drinks next Friday.",

I always told myself that I didn’t need a man and I didn’t want a bf but then I met him. He is the nicest person I have met and he makes me so incredibly happy, I wait for his messages and find myself smiling at my phone when I see his name and looking at pictures of the two of us. But I always had those little thoughts in my head of what if it’s a joke or does he really like me even though he’s always said how much he likes me but I think it’s because I’m a massive overthinker. Well he told me that he loved me on Valentine’s Day! And to be honest I was terrified, no one has ever said that to me before and I guess I’ve never thought that anyone could love me. He always tells me he loves me but I still had those silly doubts. This morning I woke up to a long paragraph from him explaining the things he loves About me, and that he promises to be the best he can. He also said that he wished I loved him as much as he loves me. It made me tear up because I do love him I am completely head over heels  for him. But his message has wiped those doubts. I am so incredibly happy with him and I really love him and I don’t even know how to describe it. I’ve never felt this way  before but is really is a magical feeling\n\nTL;DR? My boyfriend send me a paragraph explaining how in love with me he was.",

I feel like everyday i remember a moment where i ve been mean or unfair with him.\n\nI broke up with him because he was screaming during arguments and punched a wall. I broke up because in my mind i told myself people that love you don't make you cry or cause you panic attacks during fights. But now, being single again and looking at people around me, i realize that my partner had so many qualities that other people don't have, and that i ve probably been too sensitive and overthinking.\n\nI was mean to him so many times, its no wonder he was loosing patience and screaming at me. I was criticizing him for smoking weed, i was complaining he's always late and that he doesn't answer my texts or that i feel alone. But i forgot how we was doing all this stuff for me, he never asked me to cook anything, or to clean, he was taking me out to eat everyday, whenever i wanted to go on a trip he would say yes, he gave me flowers every month, he surprised me whenever had a chance, always complimenting me so why was I always complaining like a spoiled child. Why did I cry every time he yelled at me instead of fighting like an adult. Of course he was yelling at me if i was always upset and complaining about stuff. Maybe its something wrong with me because i cry easily, maybe it was my fault i was having panic attacks because i cant control my emotions. I hear all the time from other people how partners scream during fights, if im quiet and dont talk its also bad since it doesnt solve the situation.\n\nI see all these people and I dont find anyone better than my ex. He was treated me like a Queen when i wasnt starting arguments and now the treats like this another girl.\n\nOf course he moved on from me in a month when I never provided anything for him, but he did so many things for me. And what bothers me the most its that im so upset and hurt, and blame myself for something i did myself: I broke up with him. Of course he didn't want to get back together when I tried to resolve our issue, why would he?\n\nWhat i don't understand is why he came back 2 months after being with another girl saying he loves me and that i never called him to apologize for breaking up with him when I know i insisted for a month to get back together. He told me its my fault he s with someone else because this girl gave him attention, unlike me, and i cant stop blaming myself because i remember i was cold towards him. Whenever he screamed at me and even after punching the wall, I was more distant, I resented him, I kept telling myself he doesn't love me so i wasn't so affectionate.\n\nBut i forgot how i've told myself at the beginning he was a gift from God and i took him for granted.\n\nI blame myself for the times i was being mean with him, telling him we're not compatible and making him tell me he's thinking about hurting himself and having suicidal thoughts because of me. And i blame myself for comparing our relationship with others relationship saying their boyfriends dont scream at these girls, when I ignored the fact that their boyfriends they're also not so romantic and nice like mine.\n\nTl;dr: I still cant forgive myself (25F) for breaking up with my ex (35M)",

It started to hurt because she didn't value my effort of all the others things, after 5 minutes she said again that that bread was not the one she wanted, that she specifically told me she wanted the other one, me (thinking she understood when I told her there wasn't in the shop, they run out) I got sad, hurt by the accumulation of complaints, and I took the car and drove to another store (we live far from civilization and there is some expense in gasoline), I must say that she told me not to go a second time to buy the other one bread, but I was very hurt and I just wanted to fix her anger, I came back after 40 minutes with the exact bread she wanted, thinking that it would make her happy, or at least that she would appreciate my effort, but when she came back she ignored me, I was sad and depressed, I spent the night sad and slept badly.\n\nThe next morning I see that she didn't even touch the bread, then I realised that she refused to eat it on purpose, even though it was exactly what she wanted. So I asked her: \"why didn't you eat the bread?\", she told me: \"because I specifically told you not to go\", (Those words went through me like knives, she refuses to eat as a revenge) I told her that I only wanted to make her happy by bringing her the bread that she wanted and I couldn't buy at the other store, she ignored me while I told her, putting the music from the work headphones at full volume and singing, (she knows that what hurts me the most is being ignored, it causes me a lot of impotence and anxiety attacks), I try to repeat the last thing to her because it was important to me in case there had been a misunderstanding, she answered me \"fuck you, I will put the music more loud for ignore you\", there I was already very hurt and I needed to fix it, but she replied \"I'm ignoring you on purpose to get some money that you are making me losing, if I win less money is your fault\", she also told me: \"The work for you is not even important because you are not even trying\" (she knows that I am totally depressed for not finding a job at although it's true that my depression doesn't allow me to try to find job hard enough, so I know it's my fault for not trying hard enough to look for a job). She knew that I was hurt and she said \"I told you not to go\", I told her \"I just tried to solve the problem and make you happy\", she told me \"you're a fucking martyr I told you do not go but you go to buy the bread like a baby, like a martyr, that doesn't work for me\" then he imitated me putting my voice: \"I feel bad, I'm a martyr, blah blah blah\" in a humiliating tone, I then limited myself to tell her why she was so cruel and how much her words disappointed me and hurt me, but she is angry with me and doesn't care.\n\nI have to say that my goal is to get a job (I finished a university degree 5 months ago) so she can stop work and have more free time, get married and have a child together. But I am very hurt with the way she treats me, every time she treats me like this I think about committing suicide, I know I would not do it, but it makes me want to, now I just want to cry, I am a very sensitive man and it hurts a lot, she's still angry, I don't know what to do, I'm so devastated.\n\nThanks you so much if you read all the way here, means a lot for me.\n\nTL;DR: I'm trying to have a happy relationship but she get angry very often.",

        "text": "My (31F) best friend (33F) has had a very high pressure job for years. A lot of (international) travel is involved, which obviously stopped during covid. During that time she started teaching yoga classes in our hometown and got into a relationship. \n\nSince last spring her travels have returned. First gradually and then all at once. The relationship (extra family obligations) and yoga now leave her with a schedule that is totally unsustainable. \n\nOn top of that a very emotional event happened a month ago. The grief seems to be the final drop, and to me it’s pretty clear that she’s heading for a burnout (she already has blood pressure problems despite being otherwise healthy). \n\nNow here’s the kick: I’m the one she always cancels on when she feels tired. Which is all the time lately. We make a plan that fits into her crazy schedule, I get excited because I’ll finally see my best friend again, only for her to cancel on the day because she can’t get out of bed. I always offer to come over and just be with her anyway, watch a film from bed or whatever, but she always refuses. We do call and text basically daily. \n\nMy work isn’t anywhere near as crazy, but I do also work 50hr weeks. So when she cancels our evening plans, I cannot “spontaneously meet up for a coffee the next day” because she happens to have a free 45mins then. \n\nI obviously don’t want her to go over any more of her own boundaries to meet up with me!! And 100% understand that I’m the one she cancels on because she feels comfortable. So i try to be patient and just be as flexible and understanding as I can be. \n\nYesterday she expressed that she feels alone dealing with her grief and like I’m not there for her enough. \n\nI’m not gonna lie, part of me wants to yell like “remember those last five plans that we made a month in advance and you cancelled???!” \nWhich I know is not fair and won’t help the situation. \n\nBut I also feel like there’s not much more that I can do other than keep checking in on her, let her know I’m thinking of her and hope to see her someday soon. Am I missing something? Do I just show up at her house uninvited?? \n\nI’m super introverted and nothing recharges me like solitude. So I’d be seriously pissed off if a friend would barge in on my exhausted alone time lol 🥹 But then again, I’ve also never been in a similar situation. \n\nTLDR: I think my best friend is heading for a burnout. I want to support her, but she keeps cancelling all of our plans.",

        "text": "TL,DR - is it unwise from a moral standpoint to continue with an unexpected relationship if your a) still healing from your last, and b) stuck in a rut of low mood and self hatred?\n\nMorning all (if it's morning in your part of the world!)....\n\nAbout 9 months ago I was unexpectedly told by my then wife (F36) that she wasn't happy and wanted a divorce. No trial seperation, no \"this is what's wrong, let's try and sort it\", no warning at all. Apparently she had checked out about a year ago when our relationship was honestly the best it could have been.\n\nAnyway, as I was blindsided by this news, and feeling I had no other real choice I reluctantly agreed and moved out. In that 30 minutes, I lost my wife, home, job and a large amount of my friends.\n\nShe then chose to meet me in our favourite restaurant to formally break up with me, presenting me with a handwritten list of reasons why she was doing this. Things like having no drive (despite just graduating from university) and other reasons that still don't make sense to me. This really hurt, I'm not going to lie. It felt like I was being treated like an abuser, despite having no previous experience of being anything close.\n\nI subsequently found out that she was emotionally cheating and is now with the person in question. We still talk, having a complex and intertwined divorce that needs to be settled. It's quite clear from these conversations that neither of us are particularly happy right now, that neither of us know where to go from here in life and that \"divorcing me and breaking my heart will always haunt my wife till the day she dies\".\n\nAnyway, three months on from leaving the marital home I started talking to this other woman. We met through a mutual activity (I never have and never will use a dating app as they don't attract the kind of person that I see myself being compatible with). It transpired that she was going through a similar situation, albeit each party in the relationship knew that things were rocky.\n\nNeither of us planned to grow close to eachother, and wouldn't have done such a thing if we hadn't just stumbled upon eachother. My family really like her, sadly much more than my wife. We have some things in common, but also very many things that aren't.\n\nI often sit back at night and feel that this isn't the way my life should be going. I miss her when I'm away, but by no means as much as she misses me. Dispite being together less than a year, she desperately wants me to move in with her. At this current moment I don't think that's a wise idea.\n\nMy family asked me if I'm happy the other day. I said I wasn't. Thing is I'm not sure if I'm just not happy with myself and my life, as let's be honest, no one sets out to get divorced from the woman you loved so deeply for 11years. Or is it that I'm really not going to be happy in this relationship? Am I just looking for the bad because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy (this is the feeling I've gained through my breakup)? \n\nIn other words, is it wrong to love someone else if I hate myself? Do I really hate myself, or is this just depression talking?\n\nThanks for reading this long old post, and hopefully you can help this young gentleman that feels lost at sea!",

        "text": "I said in a previous post how and why I broke up with my(25f) ex (35M) and its still hurting and causing me anxiety every day. I feel like everyday i remember a moment where i ve been mean or unfair with him.\n\nI broke up with him because he was screaming during arguments and punched a wall. I broke up because in my mind i told myself people that love you don't make you cry or cause you panic attacks during fights. But now, being single again and looking at people around me, i realize that my partner had so many qualities that other people don't have, and that i ve probably been too sensitive and overthinking.\n\nI was mean to him so many times, its no wonder he was loosing patience and screaming at me. I was criticizing him for smoking weed, i was complaining he's always late and that he doesn't answer my texts or that i feel alone. But i forgot how we was doing all this stuff for me, he never asked me to cook anything, or to clean, he was taking me out to eat everyday, whenever i wanted to go on a trip he would say yes, he gave me flowers every month, he surprised me whenever had a chance, always complimenting me so why was I always complaining like a spoiled child. Why did I cry every time he yelled at me instead of fighting like an adult. Of course he was yelling at me if i was always upset and complaining about stuff. Maybe its something wrong with me because i cry easily, maybe it was my fault i was having panic attacks because i cant control my emotions. I hear all the time from other people how partners scream during fights, if im quiet and dont talk its also bad since it doesnt solve the situation.\n\nI see all these people and I dont find anyone better than my ex. He was treated me like a Queen when i wasnt starting arguments and now the treats like this another girl.\n\nOf course he moved on from me in a month when I never provided anything for him, but he did so many things for me. And what bothers me the most its that im so upset and hurt, and blame myself for something i did myself: I broke up with him. Of course he didn't want to get back together when I tried to resolve our issue, why would he? \n\nWhat i don't understand is why he came back 2 months after being with another girl saying he loves me and that i never called him to apologize for breaking up with him when I know i insisted for a month to get back together. He told me its my fault he s with someone else because this girl gave him attention, unlike me, and i cant stop blaming myself because i remember i was cold towards him. Whenever he screamed at me and even after punching the wall, I was more distant, I resented him, I kept telling myself he doesn't love me so i wasn't so affectionate.\n\nBut i forgot how i've told myself at the beginning he was a gift from God and i took him for granted.\n\n  \nI blame myself for the times i was being mean with him, telling him we're not compatible and making him tell me he's thinking about hurting himself and having suicidal thoughts because of me. And i blame myself for comparing our relationship with others relationship saying their boyfriends dont scream at these girls, when I ignored the fact that their boyfriends they're also not so romantic and nice like mine.  \n\n\nTl;dr: I still cant forgive myself (25F) for breaking up with my ex (35M)",

        "text": " \n\nI turned 27 just a few weeks ago and am in a state of extreme panic. I have zero dating experience whatsoever. This means I have never been on a date, never kissed anyone, never had sex, and really have not done anything. Being in this situation is absolutely DESTROYING my self confidence and I feel like a freak that I am in this age in this situation. There must be something unimaginably wrong with me right?\n\nI am worried that women around my age will think there is something extremely wrong with me even if a miracle does happen and I go out on a date one day. I am currently in the last semester of my master's in mechanical engineering(also same major in undergrad) and searching for a job at the moment. I am extremely shy, have few friends, and am socially awkward. I was almost going to go on my first date ever from a hinge match last week, but she flaked on me 3 hours before my date with an excuse and saying she would reschedule. She never did, and unmatched me a few days later....\n\nI feel completely worthless and feel extremely inferior. This is literally not a healthy situation for me to be in for my personal development. I want this to change ASAP. I started weightwatchers and am trying to lose weight to be healthier.\n\nMeeting people is essentially impossible because I live right next to my university campus where I am surrounded entirely by 18-20 year olds and did not bring a car(because I live right next to campus, where I also work as well...). Being in this situation is handicapping me at meeting people. I have considered matchmaking services and also speed dating events because dating apps are not working for me. Could speed dating events be a good way to meet some people? I have never tried it but was thinking it's a good idea.\n\nI don't want to die alone. I am seriously worried that I will die alone. Who is 27 and never kissed anyone? It's literally just me. I am a freak. I don't even know anymore..... Even if I do attract someone by a miracle they will think I am insanely weird for being in this situation. I don't know what to do.... How does someone make it through high school, college, and now graduate school and have NO ONE be interested in him? Of course it would freak women out.\n\nTLDR, no dating experience at all at 27 and need help. Am I doomed? Will I die alone?",

        "text": "Here’s some background: I think my (26 M) GF (26 F) has/is(?) cheating on me, but she will not admit to any wrong-doing, and when pressed she just says, “I never cheated on you, it happened before we were together.” or my favorite, “It’s my business, not yours”. \n\nThis started over our phones, she has had my passcode since we became exclusive, but has been abusing that privilege in my opinion. I have nothing to hide, but I’ve caught her snooping through everything I have on it. She got mad at some texts between me and a female friend of mine (been friends 8 years before me and my GF got together) which were about a TV show we both like, nothing remotely sexual. We talked about how my GF feels threatened by our relationship, and I agreed to stop texting my friend completely, but also told her I felt she was abusing my privacy by going through all of my texts. She agreed to not do that, but since then I have caught her twice, and had to change my passcode. GF has constantly accused me of cheating since she found the texts, and has been desperately trying to find evidence of a deeper relationship, even though there’s nothing there. She’s convinced I am hiding something, no matter what I say or do. What upsets me is that the most recent time I caught her going through her phone we got in a big argument in which I said, “It’s only fair if I get to go through yours now” which made her get HIGHLY defensive. That set off an alarm for me, and later that night I went through her phone. I know it’s childish, immature, and toxic, but I did find something. I found her talking in a group chat, and to her best friend, about some other guy, and apparently a dick pic that he sent to my GF. These texts were also sent after we started dating exclusively. When I confronted my GF about this, she told me it was someone she was talking to before me, and there was no overlap, no cheating. She also said that she didn’t feel like we were exclusive as early as I thought we were (gaslighting IMO) and that her relationship with this other guy was none of my business. I kept pressing her for more answers, but she has held firm in her response. Within a week of me finding those texts my GF deleted everything off her phone and laptop. All of her texts, pics, etc. That is what seems most suspicious to me. This whole situation feels very weird to me, and she doesn’t have any good answers as to the timeline of things, or the extent to which this went/has gone. What do you guys think? \n\ntl:dr - GF accused me of cheating, violated my trust for months, and when I did the same, I found some questionable things on her end. She deleted everything on her phone/laptop after I found out, and maintains that she never cheated, and everything that happened with this other person is none of my business.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! Thanks for reading in advance. My boyfriend and I just celebrated our first anniversary but this is an issue that hasn’t stopped coming up throughout our relationship. \n\nHe just started riding about 2 years ago, and has a Ninja (sports bike) and he just bought me my first motorcycle for my birthday last September. I’ve ridden with other people for maybe the last ~5 years. I’m still in the process of learning to ride and being comfortable on a bike by myself so the only time I see him riding is when we are together which has only happened a few times. Other than that, all I know is what he tells me or what Life360 shows me. \n\nHe loves to speed. Before we were officially together, he would be super proud to tell me he hit 160mph while on the highway earlier in the day, trying out wheelies, laughing about outrunning police, etc etc. Our very first fight ever was about how he rides his bike, and we just had our 80th argument about it again tonight. \n\nFor a little history, my ex and I were in an on again-off again relationship for years and it was very abusive. Every time we would break up I would receive videos of him going to bars and getting hammered and speeding around town on his bike in efforts to get my attention because he knew I still cared for his well-being and would say something. In the very beginning of my current relationship there were a few nights where he would go out and get too drunk and ride his bike home. I told him from the very beginning I was NOT okay with his behavior and riding drunk/recklessly was a deal breaker for me. I’m a paramedic, I’ve seen too many dead bikers and people with serious injuries from making stupid decisions and I don’t want that for him. \n\nHe has calmed down a lot on his riding since we’ve been together. He rarely speeds now, but every now and then he takes it out and still goes twice the speed limit whenever he can justify it. This means long stretches of empty roads/no traffic. I don’t know what to do anymore. Just tonight I saw he reached a speed of almost 110 on his 4 mile ride home from work where the speed limit is 55 max. He rarely goes over 110 now and says he’s calmed down enough so he doesn’t understand why I get upset. What do I say to him so he understands?\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend likes going fast on motorcycle. I’ve seen too many dead people that were going fast on motorcycles. How do I make him slow down?",

        "text": " I have a friend (Bella) who I have been friends with for over 20 years. I should add its been off and on. We lived together once which was very difficult and we’ve certainly had some breaks from each other. Not planned or discussed but needed. From my opinion she is very hard to please and expects a lot from me. I am a full time mum to two kids. I work full time. I’ve also had a really tough time recently for reasons I won’t go into but it’s been intense.\n\nAnyway, our friendship has mainly been me supporting her through different episodes of depression.  She would often come over to our house for dinners / counselling sessions. I found it trying at times because it every time the evening became about her personal problems. She would always end up crying and I would try and support her as much as possible. Sometimes this was met well and other times it wasn’t. The reassuring talks from me would be a hard pill to swallow seeing as from her prospective I have it all -  husband and kids. \n\nI can’t write about it on this post but the past couple of years have been awful. I have needed to support another of my friends because something horrific happened to her. I have mostly been focusing on this friend who we will call (Alana). Alana has been very unwell and I have been her main support. It’s affected me mentally as well. \n\nA few times Bella came over when Alana was there. Bella still seemed to make things about her. I was annoyed but understand she has issues and just tried to lead the conversation back to supporting Alana because what she had experienced need full time concentration. I cannot emphasise enough how bad this time for Alana and I was.\n\nFast forward a year or so. Things have got a little easier for Alana, Bella remains the same. I’m completely mentally drained and possibly mentally unwell with anxiety. We had been drinking a lot to get through what we had been going through and looking back I really wasn’t coping. \n\nOne night (9 months ago), Bella came over for dinner. I expected the evening to go the same as usual we would share a bottle of wine (or two) and I would help her through her shit. Anyway, she bought a gummy along. I didn’t want one because I’m not good with weed and wanted to have a good time. I got real drunk though. Like really drunk. And I hadn’t eaten so it was major drunk.\n\nAnyway I was telling a story and she was absolutely pissing herself at the story. At first I think I thought it was funny. Then when she wouldn’t let me speak for laughing I started to get annoyed. I kept pausing waiting for her to stop and she didn’t. I had forgotten she had had a gummy because I was so drunk. I snapped and said some bullshit comment like ‘do you wanna finish this story?’\n\nIt wasn’t very kind of me.  Afterwards I went over to her and said sorry I just thought it was really rude how she kept laughing over me. She got offended that I found her rude and we had a bit of cross words. Nothing major and tbh I think I was so drunk I just repeated how rude I thought it was. She got upset and I went upstairs because I wanted some alone time. I was so drunk. I sort of came to and went downstairs to sort it out. My husband reminded me that she had had a gummy and that’s why she was laughing like that. This all sounds so stupid writing it down.\n\nI apologised and said I’m really sorry I misread her actions. I apologised on repeat. She was just crying and crying. Would not accept my apology and I stayed up with her until 4am (it happened at 11pm) trying to get up back on track and okay as friends again. \n\nIn the morning I woke up and thought, that was silly. I’m sure we will be okay today though. Turns out nope. She was still not willing to forgive me. She asked for some space -which I’ll be honest I thought was over the top but agreed. \n\nI didn’t contact Bella for a while and when I did she was angry. She wanted to tell me how awful I had made her feel. In my opinion (and my husbands) I had been offended given her a bit of a hard time and then been sorry. We just had some words and then I went away for a bit. I didn’t slag her off. I didn’t hurt her or say anything derogatory about her. \n\nSo she ends up moving away for work, this was always the plan. Since then she has been messaging saying I don’t meet her needs as a friend and I need to do more. I haven’t been sorry enough or about the right thing, or in the right way. That I should go and visit her and/or put more effort in because of what I had done. Bella said she would never be able to come to our house again. Or stay the night. We had a couple of arguments because I was annoyed that she has judged our whole friendship on that night. \n\nSo then I gave some more space. That wasn’t the right thing I should’ve been doing more but I am so busy and I thought it was unfair of her to say this. She said I should’ve sent her kids artwork or a letter. So I wrote a letter but it was an angry letter and I nearly sent it but then I thought if she is depressed then I don’t want to make things harder for her. So I didn’t send it. \n\nI tried to just be normal with her. But Bella is now super distant and has rejected any olive branches I have sent. I sent a message saying I missed her and it would be good to hang out which she didn’t respond to. She has responded to other messages just about life news jobs etc  but nothing meaningful. \n\nI feel upset in a way because I really don’t like the idea of losing a friendship but I think she has completely blown this out of proportion and I don’t think we can ever sort it out. Bella is livid, thinks I’m not appreciating the scenario? Or underplaying it? Only other person present was my husband, who tells me for sure when I’m in the wrong. He said I was a bit rude for a few minutes and then when I realised she had had a gummy I was sorry and trying to make it right. He couldn’t believe it was still a thing in the morning let alone now 9 months later.\n\nI want to sort it out but I don’t want to be bullied into believing I’m not good enough or constantly having to prove that I am.\n\nI feel like she has given me much more of a hard time that I ever gave her over that 20 minute argument. I also wish she could see I was real drunk and in an emotionally vulnerable state.\n\ntl;dr Had an argument with a friend when wasted. I was in the wrong, she won't accept my apology.  Would like advice on how to make up with her.",
