I've been experimenting with hardware accelerated n-body simulators and I'm trying to bridge a gap I've noticed with demo videos that are available on youtube.\n\nBasically, I can reproduce things [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoLe1c-eokI), but not [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfND82e-fq8).\n\nThe former looks like a straight forward n-body setup, lots of particles calculating O(N^2 ) forces between them.  The later looks like (maybe?) a fluid simulation, but unfortunately the author doesn't provide many details about his videos.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand what's going on with the more fluid-like demos.  Do these have a *physically* different meaning than the straight n-body simulations, or is it just visual sugar?  If the fluid-like demos *are* physically different can the community help point me to reading to get me from the basic n-body simulations to the fluid simulations?  Or even just help me with the key words to google?\n\nThanks!",

I'm asking where is the Eiffel Tower in space at this exact time relative to nothing. On Earth this easy. We have latitude and longitude lines and relative to everything else on Earth, these don't change. However, imagine if you were standing somewhere and you got zapped out of existance for one minute and then brought back. You would not be standing in the same spot. You would either have rematerialized inside the earth or  are now floating in the vacuum of space. That's because the Earth has moved. So has the Sun, Mars, the Milky Way, Andromeda, and everything else in the universe. But we are all moving through the medium of the universe. Is there a way to apply static xyz coordinates that are relative to nothing but the universe itself? My own reasoning through this has brought me to the first roadblock which is that the universe is likely not static but expanding. If that's the case then your origin point has to be the center of the universe which isn't definable because we can't see the whole universe and in fact the center of the observable universe is each and every one of us due to how far each of us can \"see.\" I've been thinking about this all day.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/comments/5tyu2k/lets_get_creative_and_brainstorm_about_the/",
        "text": "First, let's list all of the data we have on Dark Energy right here in one spot. I tried looking online but couldn't find anything except some abstracts on different research papers about conducting some sky surveys to measure data on observable constants against theoretical. Since I haven't the faintest notion of all of the dark energy data recorded I'm unable to start this off properly. I believe a proper start to our brainstorming should be to list everything known about dark energy, and somehow I feel the Wikipedia article leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nSo unable to provide much of any information on dark energy, hopefully others can help us out, I begin to start with my first brainstorming:\n\nI wonder, what if the mechanism behind the force of gravity being so weak isn't its leaking into some sort of hyper dimension? What if the cosmological constant is right, what if a property of space is negative energy? Maybe the force of gravity isn't so weak after all. It contends with this property of space. This property of space could increase exponentially. With less gravity confining and compressing space, like intergalactic regions, space further repels and propagates more space further increasing its repulsion like a feedback loop. Dark energy would be an incredibly powerful and base state of everything. The weakness of the force of gravity isn't actually so weak it's just contending with the most powerful and natural state of the universe all around it.\n\nFurthering these ideas, what if dark energy and gravity are unified and are the same force? Suppose the lowest quantum state of space is pure repulsion and propagation of more space, this is the more and most natural state of the universe's energy. So wouldn't it be more appropriate to refer to dark energy as simply energy: *the* energy. And if gravity, being consequent the accumulation of matter/energy and these being a sort of inverse state of the more natural lower state of space, wouldn't it make sense for gravity to be the actual dark energy and just the inverse of the far more numerous and lowest state of space's energy, the energy referred to \ncurrently as dark energy.\n\nNow as the presence of space increases exponentially the force of dark energy. What if so too gravity within the confines, in sufficient amounts, of a system increased its energy exponentially. Within a galaxy of sufficient size gravity could undergo a sort of change of state, a sort of phase change, which locks all the matter/energy it contains into a kind of psuedo-one thing. Now the outer stars in this galaxy must circumnavigate it's radius at an accelerated rate as if connected to spokes radiating from its center. The stars now must operate in this phase changed system as if connected as one object having to travel around their galaxy locked together.\n\nCould these things be linked mathematically and unify ideas of dark energy, dark matter, and gravity all together through one force?",

Everything.\n\n**Just to be clear**: I'm asking if a symbol to represent the span of the Universe already exists, and explaining why I want that symbol.\n\nGoogle keeps trying to correct me to \"universal measurements\" or \"universal units of measure.\" I specifically mean the Universe; i.e., how to represent the measure of universal everything in one simple symbol, much like how x represents an unknown value, or ƒ represents an unknown force.\n\nPerhaps I know so little about the subject that I don't even know where to begin my search. If so, I'd like to hear some search terms to use.\n\nIf this isn't a thing yet, I hope to make a symbol for the Universal span. (Ü maybe? If not taken.) Seems useful. I'm trying to work out the speed of the Universe, and don't want to look stupid inventing something which could already be widely known.\n\nThe reason I'm asking is I'm hypothesizing that because it's true in quantum mechanics that Everything (all existence) exists as a single point, that the laws of physics still apply to that single point. Therefore, because objects of any size can never take up the space/time of another, that the space/time of the universe can never take up the space/time of itself, so the minimum speed of the universe must be ÜC. (Or one universal span (the entire linear space of the universe, as measured by the direction of its velocity)(Ü) times the speed of light(C).)\n\nSome assumptions I'm making are:\n \n 1. The velocity of the universe is an entirely different question because I'm not worried about its direction, only speed\n 2. The space/time continuum is real\n 3. In a multidimensional universe, everything also exists somehow on one-dimension, a.k.a., a single point\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n 1. I don't want a symbol constrained to the observable Universe, but the entire universe\n 2. I do want a constant symbol, like C, which was used even before the speed of light was confirmed.\n\nI'm not trying to rock anyone's boat, I just want a symbol, or to make my own.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Ive spent a long time working on universal expansion and it has revealed amazing things. For example, the expansion of our universe is driven by a spherical structure we inhabit, as we move up, space bends back down. Interestingly, at the core of this sphere would be matter whose attraction to the center grows as distance to it increases, identical to the strong force. If we now move backward, that spatial loop I described actually appears as an electron orbital in an Atom. Its mind boggling, and the implications are incredible. For example, if the smallest object that is certain in the universe builds into itself, the answer to the hodge conjecture is that all object build into one shape, an Atom. Fascinatingly, the laws governing this Atoms structure are gravitational, meaning all matter in the universe can be explained and predicted from an understanding of Gravity.\n\nUnfortunately I know most people will disagree with me, for these ideas do seem rather outlandish (are), still, Ive checked countless times and its the only shape that is possible.\n\nThis is also incredible because Atoms are electrical entities, yet they are governed by Gravity! This means we can assume a gravitational perspective on electricity, and as formerly described, the strong force! its incredible, and if it interests you, Id advise you to tell some friends about it and check out the shitty website Ive made for it, systemological.com\n",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm wondering if I can get some advice on how to get in to astrophysics simulations.\n\nThere's quite a detailed explanation below and I'm not certain this is the correct place for this post - if not, please let me know :) \n\nI've known since a young age I was interested in astrophysics simulation/modelling work. I looked at doing joint degrees in Computing/Astrophysics and Computing/Maths at Undergraduate level, but in the end I decided upon Game Programming as it allowed me to delve much more heavily into the programming aspects (software dev practices, C++ and C#), less of areas I wasn't interested in (e.g. computer networks and forensics) and also covered some maths.\n\nI graduated Uni 2 years ago with a first in computer game development (all programming, no design components) so I know C++ and some maths, but not at the level I expect is needed to go in to astrophysics.\n\nFor my final year dissertation I worked on a computing algorithm for detecting stellar clusters within galaxy data, but I suspect that the outcome of this was basic and could be greatly expanded on. The astrophysics knowledge needed for this work was practically none - I had an astrophysics tutor guiding me with these requirements. I was offered a PhD to continue the work but couldn't accept due to lack of funding.\n\nI have no astrophysics theoretical knowledge. I've been working as a .Net developer since graduation.\n\nI've been looking at courses such as the Next Generation Computer Modelling PhDs offered at Southampton University (http://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/index.html) and the Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering Masters offered by KTH-Sweden, Delft-Netherlands and Berlin-Germany and Guwahati-India (https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/cosse/master-s-programme-in-computer-simulations-for-science-and-engineering-1.44243).\n\nIn truth I've been looking at these courses (specifically COSSE in Sweden/NL) for years but I didn't really know how to get from where I am now to where I want to be. I suspect that my mathematical and astrophysics skills aren't at the level needed for this type of course. Would I need a second undergrad in maths or astrophysics? This, financially, is not possible. Are there other alternatives? Would I be able to do a masters in mathematics or astrophysics - firstly would I be likely to have the prerequisites for these courses, and secondly would these prepare me well enough for then completing the PhD or Master courses above?\n\nI've also read that these roles are few and far between - as most astrophysicists have the CS skills themselves - can anyone tell me if roles in these areas are hard to find? I'm currently based in the UK and I'm aware I'll need to move for study - will I need to stay there/move again for work? If anyone who works in this field can offer any insight in to the roles available or the job market that would also be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you so much for any knowledge or advice you can offer.\n\nMae :)",

This question comes from both ignorance and fascination.\n\nLet's assume that wormholes are indeed real. If you dive into one (or rather fall into one) due to its gravitational pull, would you not be sucked in again if you somehow reach the other end? In my mind the other end of a wormhole is another wormhole, the exit door of a tunnel so to speak, and therefore you'd still be in the wrong side of the event horizon. \n\nTo exit at the other side you'd have to escape the event horizon of the second black hole, which is impossible as I understand.\n",

She is doing extremely well in school and she's ahead of her class. I want to show my support by helping her . So does anybody know anything I could get for her any space programs ? I'm in the Chicago area and she's been to the Adler planetarium alot. And for xmas I got her a telescope.  I just want to support her dream And hope I'm not missing anything.",

Maybe you could recommend me some decent literature on planetary science.\n\nI'm a geologist and a geophysicist. My education was predominantly focused on industrial applications, not really on global processes and universal mechanisms that could be relevant to other planets. I do read scientific articles on specific geophysical properties of individual celestial bodies, but those are bits of information that don't really form a complete picture.\n\nWhat I need is a solid handbook on celestial mechanics and planetary physics to give me a systematised knowledge on the subject. I'd prefer if it also discussed the history and methodology of planetary studies in detail, but it's not crucial. Or maybe you know a book devoted solely to this topic? Throw it at me. Give me as many recommendations as you think suitable, including review articles with deep insight into more specified topics (e.g. planetary magnetic fields). Just anything you'd consider important for someone to call himself a 'planetologist'.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nPS Obviously I've done some google search and stumbled upon some great online repositories. But I'm sure there are a lot of great books out there that can't simply be downloaded for free and I wouldn't know if they are worth buying unless you recommend them to me. ",

        "text": "Hi reddit.\nI wanted to share a paper I wrote and published on a site called Publish Research. The paper is titled \"Gravity and the Inertial Frame\" (an original work). The basic concept:\nGravity is inversely proportional to absolute (or composite) velocity. Simply put: (gravity of Earth) = (radius of Earth) / (absolute velocity of Earth). Absolute velocity is composed of individual rotational velocities from each inertial frame in which it is rotating.  Together, these velocities correlate to a universal inertial frame.\n\nHere's the url where you can download the full doc:\nhttp://www.publishresearch.com/\n\nDirect link to my paper:\nhttp://www.publishresearch.com/searchresult?search=gravity+and+the+inertial+frame&amp;submit=Go+%3E&amp;doctype=0&amp;topic=0&amp;yrfrom=&amp;yrto=\n\nI'm thinking this is either total garbage (I haven't found anything new or novel), already known and I just never found the prior art despite a lot of searching, or this is truly something new and potentially profound. In any case, I wanted to share and get more eyes and minds on it.\nThoughts and comments welcome. However, please note that my days are busy, so delays in replies are likely.\n\nThanks,\n\n--fenderphysics\n\n\nEdit: Adding a little detail here to give a better summary of the contents of the paper...\n\nThe formula for the acceleration of gravity given in the paper is:\n\nag = (r * d) / SQRT(vg^2 + vs^2 + vp^2 + vr^2 )\n\nwhere:\n\nag = acceleration of gravity;\n\nr = radius of the planet;\n\nd = density ratio of the planet to Earth (value for Earth = 1.0);\n\nvg = velocity of the galaxy;\n\nvs = velocity of the solar system;\n\nvp = velocity of the planet as it rotates around the sun;\n\nvr = rotational velocity (or spin) of the planet itself;\n\n\nThe root of the sum of squares of velocity is what I refer to as absolute (or composite) velocity.\nThe paper also has a velocity-based formula for escape velocity. Please refer to the paper for more details on the formulas, explanations, theories, a few predictions based on the theories (like gravity is fluctuating) as well as working examples. These aren't just formulas for speculation, they actually seem to work, and I show real calculations in the paper.\n\nSo, reddit and the astrophysics community, please tell me if you've seen anything like this before. Is this uncovering a new universal relationship between gravity and absolute velocity? Does it represent a new relationship between mass (or matter) and absolute velocity as I speculate in the paper?\n\nThanks again,\n\n--fenderphysics",

        "text": "To start with, I have no mathematical background in astrophysics, beyond an introductory course,  years ago. My question revolves around the  [Alcubierre Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), and its theoretical application to space travel. Since the basis of the technology depends on the contraction and expansion of space, I wonder, whether it would ever actually bring you any closer to your target.  \nHere is my problem, let us suppose that I wanted to go to Alpha Centauri, and we compressed the space before over that distance, and expanded the space behind me, to the point that my region of space, across the fabric of space, could be considered at my destination. However, I now have, an the same amount of space to the original distance between me and Alpha Centauri, and since all of our units of measurement are a unit of distance across said space for example a km, would I not therefor have the same number of kms between me and Alpha Centauri, effectively meaning, that to me, the observer stuck within the confines of space, nothing would have happened. There would, in fact, be the same \"amount\" of space in front and behind me, I think this would also effect light as well, which travels **THROUGH** that space. The light would still travel the same number of \"units of space\" as before, meaning it would still take ~4lys to reach me. My thought process could be entirely misunderstanding the interaction between the things IN space, and the fabric of space itself, so I am very interested if anyone out there, with a background in this, could maybe clear this up, or explain where my thinking is flawed.\nThank you for you time.",
