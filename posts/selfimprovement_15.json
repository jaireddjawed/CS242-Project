        "text": "Around the start of November, I felt like the world had suddenly turned against me.  \nEarly September was my peak month, during that time I was an unstoppable machine, and everything was going well for me. I was stronger, more disciplined, able to increase my connections and income, and pursued my goal. I was doing everything right. Reading, Writing, Journaling, Meditating, and most importantly not doing the bad habits: porn and wasting time surfing the internet.  \nMid-September is when the last year of high school started for me, no worries I thought, I'll just reformat my daily routine. Then a very unpleasant scenario happened with a particular girl. No big deal I will come out stronger, right? Then school forced me to pay a lot more attention to it than I could with my other hobbies due to exams. Slowly but surely every little habit that I had introduced slowly fickled away, until around November I had removed every single one from my life. I would like to state that I have also never been a hard worker so lazing around is really easy for me to get into the habit of. Got back into scrolling on TikTok and Instagram Rells like a mindless drone and got back into watching 5 Youtube videos at the same time because I couldn't focus.\n\n  \nIn the past 4 months, I have not read a single book (tried but couldn't get past one or two chapters)  \nNot meditated once  \nRegularly missed going to the gym  \nAte to the point that I have regained 7 kg (cut from 103kg to 89.5, now at 96.5)  \nHaven't Journaled a sing word  \nAnd most importantly haven't worked on my goal, hobbies, or income and I blame myself entirely for this.  \n\n\nIt was obvious to me how to start building back the blocks to regaining myself (creating a small routine that I will follow for a week and then build on it).  \nBut I just couldn't bring myself to it, it was too hard, felt like iId just give in again, so what's the point?  \n At the time of writing this, I have had enough of my uneasiness and being so unsure of myself, I am starting a job to save some cash to get me out of debt and I am ready to balance school, work, and self-improvement.   \nThank you to whoever may be reading this and know that if you are relapsing it is never too late to get yourself back on track.",

        "text": "I absolutely love writing on subreddits that focus on self-improvement because I feel like I'm surrounded by people who think just like me. We're all on the same journey, trying to become the best version of ourselves, and that's something we all have in common.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not uncommon to have moments where we doubt ourselves and wonder if all our efforts are even worth it. But the truth is, they are. Sometimes we just need someone to remind us of that, to encourage us and remind us of how far we've come. Looking back at where we were a year ago can be a great way to do just that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's like the saying goes, you never know what you have until it's gone. The same can be said about the gifts and blessings we have in our lives. We often take them for granted because we've always had them or they come naturally to us. But when we see someone who doesn't have those things and works hard to achieve them, we can gain a newfound appreciation for what we have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's why I think it's important to have a community of people who support us on our personal growth journeys. We can learn from each other's experiences and inspire one another to keep going, even when it's tough.\n\nFor anyone who doubts himself at times, I would like to remind you how easy it is to go down and how hard it is to go up, I don't know a single person who struggles with going down on stairs, it's so easy but how hard is it to actually go up the stairs?\n\nmost of you won't be able to actually go up a 1000 stairs in 1 go, but I believe you are able to go 1000 stairs down so easily\n\nThink about that.\n\nThat's one of many of God's wisdom implemented in our lives.\n\nTo anyone who may doubt themselves at times, let me remind you of a simple truth - going down is easy, while going up is hard. Have you ever seen someone struggle with going down a flight of stairs? It's effortless, isn't it? But what about going up? Most of us would struggle to climb a thousand stairs in one go. It's an example of God's wisdom implemented in our daily lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA single negative thought can lead you down a path of self-sabotage, but it takes a thousand positive thoughts to achieve one good thing. Positive energy has a better effect, but negative energy is stronger. That's why you need to build a defense system - for your ego, your habits, your dreams. One negative opinion can bring your entire building down, so build with materials that can withstand any attack. Build with stone, metal, and titanium, and build with pure grit and strength. When others are crashing down the stairs, your positive mindset will fuel you to greatness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are not all built on the same foundation or had the same positive upbringing. However, that doesn't mean we can't be great. Rome wasn't built in a day, but it took much longer to build than it did to destroy. We will all perish one day, but our essence lives on through our children, our bloodline, and our legacy. My energy is ruthless, uplifting, and motivating. I strive to be impeccable, brutal, and powerful in all aspects of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am untouchable when it comes to hate. No amount of hate can penetrate my soul because I have built myself to deflect hate bullets like rubber. I am not here to talk about how great I am. Instead, I am here to show you how great you can be. Two years ago, I was a useless consumer, but today I am a pioneer in every field I put my foot in. It's all about mindset, and it was gifted to me. As a great king serves his people, I try my best to serve you. I am not perfect, but I don't give up. I am not invincible, but I am as mighty and strong as a man can be.\n\nWHATEVER YOUR GOAL MAY BE, I BELIEVE IN YOU\n\nI have been receiving an overwhelming number of messages lately, filled with compliments and kind words about my writing and my character. And while their appreciation means a lot to me, I have always been my own biggest supporter. But even with my strong defense system, there are days where I feel down and unsure of myself. So, what do I do? I climb up and down the stairs, over and over again, until I am breathless. I push myself to go faster on the way up and slower on the way down, building up my endurance and inner strength.\n\nRemember, when you are doubting yourself, remind yourself of how effortless it is to go down and how arduous it is to go up. Stay strong and keep climbing those stairs.",

        "text": "Long story short, I 20f ended up in a mental hospital and they gave me the test to determine which disorders I have. My results were it‚Äôs bipolar or BPD. They gave me two pamphlets to read one for each disorder, and things stuck out to me and both of them. For years, I have been convinced that I have BPD and I finally felt like I was going to get help for this.\n\nUnfortunately, the psychiatrist in the hospital did not like me at all. He did not want to hear what I had to say and didn‚Äôt even care about the trauma that I have been through which is a lot.\n\nYou can skip this if you want but just for some back story:\n- sexual assault as 5 and 9\n- attempt to convert my sexuality at 12\n- multiple rapes at 15, 18, and 19\n- suicide attempt at 9, 15, 16, and 19\n- severe bullying through school years \n- debilitating health issues \n- emotional and verbal abuse from parents\n- drug abuse from 14-19\n- homelessness 19\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot more, but I won‚Äôt get in to it as those are the big things. Immediately I was forced to take medication and they decided that I have bipolar instead of BPD. \n\nThe medication did not do anything for me other than make me lose my coordination, become mute for months I still struggle with talking, all I could do was sleep for 18 hours a day, have drool leak out of my mouth and barely understand English. I was told that if I did not take these meds, my privileges in the hospital would be taken away or I would be locked up in isolation. \n\nI had had severe reactions from psychiatric medication I‚Äôm the past before this experience I have tried different medications for depression such as prozac which made me hallucinate and 100x more depressed as well as zoloft which made my suicidal thoughts sky rocket. I have always had bad reactions to psych medication nothing has ever helped.\n\nFast forward three months I finally get out of that hell hole and I am able to see a psychiatrist outside of the hospital. Him and my therapist agree that I am on way too many meds at this point I had no emotion. I was basically acting like a dysfunctional robot this was one of the most scary times of my life. They start taking me off of them. In the hospital I was on at least 15 different medication‚Äôs. eventually I get back my balance, stop drooling, stop sleeping 18 hours a day, and I‚Äôm able to mutter a couple of words.\n\nI‚Äôve been off the meds for about five months by now and I‚Äôm almost functioning how I used to. Unfortunately, I still haven‚Äôt been able to get a different diagnosis although I have taken a different test to see which disorders I have. I feel very dismissed by this new psychiatrist as he has implied that everything that has happened to me is my fault. He won‚Äôt even entertain the possibility of it being BPD, I haven‚Äôt seen this psychiatrist in six months and I took the test in late summer last year. I haven‚Äôt even been told the results and from last I‚Äôve heard he has not even gone through my new evaluation. I am just at a loss.\n\nThe only thing the psychiatrist has done for me is convinced me, while in this crazily nonfunctional medicated state that I should let my parents be my legal guardians, which now that I am closer to my normal self, I severely regret. As well as put me into a complex ptsd and therapy group which in all honesty has not helped at all.\n\nDo you think I should see a different psychiatrist? Is is worth it to fight for a correct diagnosis? Have you had success with psych medication?",

        "text": "I guess this is mostly just to vent and get my frustrations off my chest. It may be a little disjointed and out of order in places. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the longest time I have tended to be \"anti-social\" and didn't have many friends or go out much socially, definitely an introvert. Have been on various meds over the years to treat my social anxiety and I wonder if they really ever helped all that much. Partly due to my anxiety, partly my personality, and I guess just dealing with shit growing up - I've always been kind of high strung, easily stressed, and prone to anger - things that I certainly did not deal with or manage in a healthy way. The person I was certainly did not lend itself to making or keeping friends either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, managed to get through school, found an amazing woman that became my wife, now have a home and 3 dogs - still other issues to deal with, but life is never going to be perfect. Moved away and lost touch with most of the few friends I had, not great at staying in touch with family either (issues there now too, maybe that's where some of my problems come from) and feel like I kind of have to start over in some respects with my life. The lack of social relationships beyond that of my amazing wife has been starting to eat at me more and more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the years I have worked overnights, almost exclusively by myself and thought that suited me just fine. Worked for a toxic employer and luckily got out just by chance that a former boss happened to consider me for a job (honestly surprised me) and I ended up getting it. Before that though I was so fed up with my job, employer, and career that I had started back taking classes online to explore other options. Found myself struggling more with that than I ever had in the past, ended up going to the doctor and getting treated for ADD (I always wondered if I was, but just managed the best I could over the years). That definitely seemed to help for awhile, but then I ended up taking the new job and stopping school for now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I work closely with a team and along with many others in our department. In the beginning I felt like I was doing well and picking things up but then I seemed to hit a wall and felt like I was struggling more and even regressing. So, back to the doctor, adjust some meds and try again. That was definitely a bad idea - that made everything worse for a time - multiple serotonergic meds + Adderall and you are in for a bad time. Bouts of hyperthermia, sweating, agitation, worsening anxiety and even panic attacks. After an acutely bad night I stopped all my meds completely for a couple days (not the best idea, I don't recommend that just anyone do this without help) and started back at a lower dose of Adderall and currently holding my \"psych\" meds to see what I might be like now without them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, after a few tough days, I feel much better and more in control - I know I still have a long road ahead of me and I cannot change all my behaviors and habits overnight - that is going to take time. I am fortunate that a colleague from my team (took pity on me? probably not, she honestly seems to be a genuinely great person) was willing to listen to my problems without judgment and gave a lot of good advice and guidance and I feel like I am heading in the right direction at work. I know it is still a process and there will be good days and bad days, but  I feel like I am better equipped to handle that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would always stress about the littlest things, never thought I was good enough, constant anxiety and nagging doubts in my mind. But recently, it was like I had an epiphany and it all seemed to melt away after I adjusted my meds - I didn't have racing thoughts in my head all the time, it was peaceful, quiet for once. I know I probably still need to see a professional and talk through some of this and help devise a better plan and coping strategies - I am not quite ready to  do that, but I am definitely closer to doing that than I ever have been in the past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has more friends  through work, but she still struggles feeling left out too. We've gone through some shit the last few years on top of COVID and she has started going to Church again, she hadn't gone since she was much younger, before we had met and gotten together. She and I have very different views on God and religion and we amicably agree to disagree. She is getting more involved with her Church now to be more active outside of the home. I've even gone to a couple services with her, it definitely is still not for me. I'm glad she has that resource and outlet though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tended to be very opinionated and vocal on certain topics and tended to see the world in terms of black and white. Now, being a bit older and hopefully a little more mature, the world, and life in general, is clearly never that simple. I didn't listen well to others, and tended towards being a contrarian all the time, honestly in a lot of ways I was a negative, borderline toxic person to be around at times. Working mostly alone for years at a job and for a company I hated certainly did me no favors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also trying to find other interests or pursuits or even go back to old ones I'd given up on. Over the  last several years (pre-COVID even) I can definitely see that I was depressed on top of my issues with anxiety and everything else and rarely had the motivation to do anything or go anywhere. I'd start something and never finish it, plan to do things and then feel overwhelmed and never even start. I tend to get a little obsessive sometimes and just dive into a subject way too far and make plans that are way too grand, rather than start small and reasonable and work my way from there. During COVID, my wife and I also neglected our household upkeep - both dealing with our own depression from isolation and otherwise. Now that seems an insurmountable task to get things back in order and just causes anxiety and more feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to work though - recently had the opportunity to go out with a bunch of colleagues from work and had a great time, got to know a few of them better and realized how nice it is to actually make connections with people and to be part of a group for a change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow back to the colleague who has been helping me, she is a much better person than I have been in the past, she is someone both personally and professionally that I aspire to be more like in the future. She has graciously invited me along to do things together outside of work and possibly my wife and I will get together with her and her husband sometime in the near future to hang out or whatever. Her husband actually works at our same employer, but different shifts - I've met him and spoken to him on occasion and he seems like a pretty cool dude, but we really only see each other in passing. We seem to share many common interests and she along with my wife's support have helped to get me out of my comfort zone and try some new things that in the past I would have brushed off and not done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my anxiety is starting to creep back in - I haven't made a new friend in so long, I really only have one close friend I stay in contact with now - but we live far apart and only see each other once or twice a year. My few close friends from college I've lost touch with over the years as well - my fault as well as theirs too I suppose, neither side ultimately made the effort to keep the friendships going. Now that I have a chance to make a friend not only in my field but someone that shares some common interests I guess I am terrified that I will find some way to screw things up. She and her husband have two young children (and all the associated obligations that go along with that) so obviously they do not have the free time that my wife and I do (we don't have children, that would another very long post, maybe for another time).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that I just need to \"be myself\" (not the toxic person I was in the past) but the better version that I am trying to be and whatever happens, happens. I touched on how much she has helped me at work recently, and I feel deeply indebted to her for that and hope to be able to repay the favor in some small way in the future. I ended up writing a rather lengthy thank you card along with a gift card to one of her and her husband's favorite restaurants, I just hope that my semi-rambling insecurities didn't sneak into it and make things weird at work or otherwise - she has already heard many of them and still helped me so I probably shouldn't be too worried. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I feel happy at work (as happy as you can be at work I suppose, it's still work) and feel like I am taking steps in the right direction at home too, it's just going to take time. I'm just terrified that somehow, some way it's all going to fall apart and it won't last. That's the feeling I want to make go away now, everything else will work out one way or another I suppose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nDamn, that's a wall of text. So obviously most people aren't going to read it, just needed to get some thoughts off my chest even if it is just into the void. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow have any of you dealt with the nagging self-doubt that seems to invariably creep in once we begin making positive changes in our lives and seem to finally start heading in the right direction again?",

        "text": "After a long depression because of self-consciousness and awful job loss I decided that it should come to an end.\nI should thank my husband the most !\nWhenever I started working out something would come in the way and I always had a bad mindset about it.\nBiggest obstacle was health issues, I was hospitalized because of a genetic disease that came all of a sudden ( im not gonna mention the name of the disease ) so I had to have surgery so I wasn't able to lift anything heavy obviously for 6 months.\nI was always chubby so I lost weight before the operation as well, and after the operation I lost even more and my doctors told me I should gain weight because I was anorexic at that point.\nSo I started eating more without question and went overboard. I deeply regret it.\nThen my eating disorders peaked by weighing myself every day. If i gained I would be happy and if i lost I would be disappointed and just give up.But sometimes if i was in a better mood i would just say oh a pound or two its no big deal i will handle it and i just let myself go.\nThen i started working after i finished school and i would be so tired after work i wouldn't have the energy to work out ( as i thought i did my workout for the day ).\nNot so long after i realized i am looking worse and worse. Weight went up, muscle went down, body fat went up. I looked awful.Body all so squishy and wobly. I would avoid intercourse with my partner because I would feel so self conscious.\nI lost my job and then the depression went to its peak. I would just play games all day, eating too much, barely drink water, and sleep so much my partner would beg me to get up ( i cant fall asleep at night because of all the thoughts and then cant get up in the morning )\nAnd one day my husband said:\nI'm gonna let you whine around and be depressed about your job for a week top. By the time you should recollect your thoughts and start working on yourself. It breaks my heart to see you like this.You cry about how you hate the way you look ? Then change it !\nAnd then something hit me.\nI realized this leads to nowhere and it affects my husband as well.\nSo I started working out at home. It's been two full weeks now and I already see change because I do the exercises that feel best for me ( exp. i cant do hip thrusts because it hurts my surgery area, but butt bridges do just fine ).\nI eat much better and created a great eating window.\nI am going for a job interview next week and I'm so excited.\nI feel like my mindset just changed drastically ! I don't weight myself everyday  anymore after 5 crazy mind shattering years.\nAnd for all this I will thank my husband for lifting me up.It's not just motivation, but determination and dedication. I finally feel so proud of myself.",

What did you learn?\n\nI started therapy maybe a year ago, and I had not been able to be consistent with it until this month. I would frequently go several months without seeing the therapist due to a lot of factors. Due to a change in schedule and settling out of other issues, I am now able to go twice a month, perhaps even more as time allows.\n\nMy purpose in going was to address issues that have plagued me since childhood, some that I was never even really aware of until recently; attachment style and issues related to that, poor boundaries, my tendency to attract narcissists, consistent poor outcomes in past relationships, my tendency to attract friends who are toxic, needy, or have significant MH issues, poor self-esteem and self-worth, feelings of anger or regret about past situations, feelings of sadness over illness and loss of family members. As everybody always says, **you** are the common denominator in all of your issues and problems. I really want to get sorted out.\n\nMy issue is this: I go, talk, she listens. I‚Äôm not really getting anything in return. Is this normal? I was thinking we were going to dig into my childhood, she would give me some assignments or something, like journaling, she would offer more insight or tools or *something* . I want to know how I ended up the way I am, and getting the results I‚Äôm getting. She doesn‚Äôt seem to have much knowledge of attachment styles.\n\nWhat I want to know is: is this normal? Is she going to let me talk for say two months, then hit me with the real stuff after I‚Äôve had a chance to vent? What‚Äôs the end game? What has therapy looked like for you? Did you get assignments? Did it help? What did you learn? Should I be looking for someone else, or stick with her a while?",

        "text": "I'm grateful for my FLAWS.\nNot being boastful, but yeah. \nI was insecure about my face being way too childish, and I had not grown any beard until 16 which I thought made me look less of a man. I was a skinny fat punk, who was consuming a lot of junk food, was not getting any female attention and was a total disappointment in academics and sports. Despite being physically present, I was totally absent for years. Due to a lack of confidence, I wasn't taking part in anything. My mental health was shit, I was addicted to social media and video games. The second I'd come home from school, I'd mostly play video games and scroll through social media while neglecting my academic responsibility. \nAnd then came a day when my dad received a notice from my school saying that I had been late to school for quite some time and was lacking in performance as well so as a punishment, I was being heavily fined. My parents SCOLDED me a lot.\nThe same day at school, my friends came up to me and BODY-SHAMED me. Moments later, my teacher SHOUTED at me in front of the entire class for my worst performance.\nI almost shed a tear that day :'(\nThat day in solitude, I made a commitment to myself to be tougher and better. I thought to myself, no matter what, I want my 10/10 body and a competitive score in school. And started working for it in silence. There were multiple challenges, demotivation and mental breakdowns. Above all, my father passed away, the most momentous TRAUMA of my life &lt;/3\nThat incident left me heartbroken, lost all motivation, got mentally paralyzed, and every worry seemed ridiculous. I vehemently refused everything and treated everyone with hostility.\nWhen broken-hearted, it's up to you if you'll think of it as fuel to your struggles or a reason to stay the same and de-value yourself. And I decided to get my shit together and make a comeback to life. I gave it my very best and pushed it as hard as I could. \nOnce you get serious towards to goals, your circle narrows and only the real ones stay. I started studying for over 6 hours besides school and got myself into a tuition academy and prioritized lifting for one hour every night, didn't care if it was 2 am at night.\nSometimes I was sleeping after 1 or 2 days cos of study. But I tried my best to continue the hard work. And inevitably the hard work paid off and got A-1 grades in all the subjects. \nI was doing home workouts while at school. My first day at the gym was when I gave my last exam.\nAnd now here I am, it's my 7th month working out at the gym. Made some huge progress, am far more confident, am proud of my old self for making the right decisions and for prioritizing delayed gratification. I can't help but respect myself for doing the hard work especially when I didn't felt like doing it.",

        "text": "Hey, so I've always loved doing art, whether it be classic pencil on paper, painting, digital art, sculpting, 3D modelling and what ever else. However, over the last few years I have been severely depressed and I haven't done much besides drinking, smoking weed, gaming and complaining about my crappy job. Anyways, I recently read the manga \"Chainsaw Man\" and it really awoke something in me, and I decided it was time to start drawing again. So I did and I sucked and wanted to give up instantly, I'd lost my edge and fallen off. So I took to the internet and began learning the basics, again. It's been about 2 weeks now and I've filled 32 pages of a sketchbook with tons of random practices sketches and for the first time in years I'm really having fun. I dusted off my old WACOM tablet and have been doing digital art again too. The process of learning something new, copying and studying it for a while, and eventually being able to draw said thing from memory with ease, and it looking good, is giving me some good ol' dopamine every time I finish a sketch. Soon I hope to begin posting actual art again, with proper perspective and proportions, and anatomy that actually looks somewhat realistic. So yeah, that's pretty much it. I felt like sharing, as it's the first time in my life I've actually gone all out into something and I feel I'm truly falling in love with the hobby. Is my life any better? Probably not. But now amongst the 100 shitty things, I've got something that allows me to take my mind off of everything and just get absorbed into the page, and when I emerge I've created something. I'm really excited for the adventure ahead, and I hope everyone else finds or starts something they really enjoy. Thanks for reading.",

I hate the fact that I have self-destructive habits that I can't seem to break, no matter how hard I try.\n\nI know I'm not alone in feeling this way, but it doesn't make it any easier. Every day, I wake up and look in the mirror, and I feel like a failure. I know that I have so much potential, but I can't seem to get out of my own way.\n\nI have so many self-destructive habits that I don't even know where to start. I binge eat junk food, I procrastinate on everything, I isolate myself from friends and family, and I engage in other unhealthy behaviors that only make me feel worse about myself.\n\nI've tried therapy, I've tried medication, I've tried talking to friends and family, but nothing seems to work. I always end up back where I started, feeling like a failure and hating myself even more.\n\nBut despite all of this, I want to change. I want to be a better person, a happier person, a person who doesn't hate themselves every single day. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to break these self-destructive habits and become the person I know I can be.\n\nI'm writing this post because I need support. I need to know that there are people out there who understand what I'm going through and who can help me through this. I'm tired of feeling alone and helpless.\n\nSo, if you're reading this and you can relate to what I'm saying, please reach out.

They were not motivated even to improve themselves but were real friends and I left them with many insults, it broke their hearts and mine too with the passage of time. Today, writing this because I had a really really bad day and realised that I literally have no one to share my pain, someone to vent to, everybody needs a person who gives them comfort. Yeah I do have parents but I don't want them to feel sad by watching their kid breakdown. All that 'grind mindset' left me alone and lonely with a small number of successes which I could have achieved even being associated with them. Those friends now won't even talk to me now, they resent me and any other friends I tried to make don't feel real as them. So in conclusion, don't leave the people who you enjoy with, who you vibe with or you'll become empty with time and regret that decision for a couple of years.",

Still something I've been working in order to fix, and it's incredibly hard.\n\nSometimes I look back to my past and I notice all the anger, all the crying, all the disappointment... And I've always directed it towards myself, blaming myself, destroying my self-esteem.\n\nObviously, that's not okay, that's also something I'm trying to fix as well. Having low self-esteem is not good.\n\nAnd yet, I can't help but wonder... How did I not end up a Incel? How is it possible that I didn't start hating on women as a whole, despite all the suffering?\n\nA lot of people, unfortunately here on reddit as well, tried to drag me into Incel-like ideologies, blackpill, redpill and the like. And yet I've always felt some kind of repulsion for it, as if I wasn't liking what I was reading. It made me feel uncomfortable, like what I was reading was... very wrong, despite resonating with me in some aspects. Sure, I have huge problems in the dating market, but is that really the solution?\n\nAnd then it dawned on me - I can't hate women, I can't treat them bad, because when I've been suffering, when I had doubts, when I did hit some emotional lows, they were there. For me.\n\nThe vast majority of my (close) friends are women. I don't know why, it just turned out this way during my life, I feel comfortable with them. They are gentle, empathic, and when I'm with them it fees like I can tell them whatever I want. They're like sisters I never had.\n\nI can't wish them bad, I can't take on incel ideologies, they would suffer for it.\n\nWithout them, my life would be definitely worse. And so... I just wanted this to say, to myself, to them and to the world.\n\nThanks to my all female friends. Thanks for your kindness and for not making me take a darker path.",

I got embarrassed by my mom's reaction so I started to teach myself where each country was situated on the world map &amp; learned their capital cities &amp; flags (might forgotten some cities by now but I can recognize any flag I see, most of the time at least).

        "text": "I'm 22 and tired of social media. I have nobody to talk to as i have isolated myself from social life to work on my business goal. \n\nCurrently I'm going through a lot of stress and lonliness that's why i still use social media but i know it doesn't do any good overall. It's just better than being entirely idle, killing time. \n\nBut i can't wait to delete all social media when i go out in the world and start living in real world.\nI haven't been to Ocean since 2 years, that's where i feel most alive. I need no virtual world when i have the sun, the ocean and cold breeze.\n\nIn few months I'll achieve my goals hopefully and then I'll delete my socials permanently except WhatsApp. Maybe I'll keep reddit for posting random thoughts but no more scrolling or looking to connect with new people online.\n\nAs i get older I'll even throw away my phone someday. I remember me being so creative and throughtful in my early teenage years before i had access to phone and internet. I used to write poems , i wrote 3 thriller novel, so many artwork, creating scrapbook, journaling &amp; everyone knew me in school and everywhere i went for my crazy habits of reading books. I used to read hundreds of books a year. Now i can't read more than 10. Everything gone to shit since i got my phone.",

        "text": "Step 1: Seclude Yourself.\n\nWhatever your situation allows try your best to get away from people who reinforce your bad habits. If you live with them find an activity to do that allows you to leave the house for several hours a day. Just create as much space as you can between you and other people. It's okay to ignore them while you're evolving your mind. Another very affective thing you can do is stop watching tv, deactivate social media, and reduce your time on the phone.\n\nStep 2: Shadow Work. \n\nReally dig deep into your past. Review your entire life from the very beginning. Analyze the key events that have shaped who you are now. The point of this step is to bring back all of those old emotions you have suppressed. Feel these emotions then intentionally tell yourself that its time to let go. These events don't define who you are nor do they serve you anymore. You are moving on to a brighter future. You can't hold onto a bag of rocks anymore. Whatever happened already happened. The people you have lost and the person you once were when you were first born would want you to be your best version.\n\nStep 3: Research and Apply.\n\nNow this step can take a while. It took me about 5 to 6 years and I am still working to be my best version, but the most important thing you can do is learn new information. Philosophy, nutrition, religion, geography, anthropology, astrology, astronomy, science, quantum physics, new thought, medical research, etc. Just start consuming these new avenues and perspectives of life. Expand your view of the world. \n\nIn order to change we have to change our habits mentally, physically, and spiritually. Everyone deserves prosperity!",

Sure, I can read and write in English, but that's about it. When it comes to other subjects like math and science, I feel like I don't even know the basics. It's disheartening to think about how much time and effort I've put into school, only to come out feeling like I've wasted it all.\n\nTo make matters worse, school also gave me a lot of insecurities and trauma that I'm still struggling to overcome even a year after graduating. I saw classmates who couldn't even read or write despite 15 years of language education, and I feel like I would have ended up like them if it weren't for my aunt's help.\n\nBut now that I'm out of school, I'm wondering if it's even worth trying to go back and learn everything I feel like I missed out on. I've been looking at online courses like Khan Academy and feeling like I could learn everything in a year if I just dedicated 6 hours a day to it. But at the same time, I feel like the traditional curriculum didn't work for me, so why bother with it now?\n\nI'm thinking about designing my own learning system, one that focuses on personal growth and not just academic subjects. But I'm also wondering if that's even useful or practical. What do you guys think? Have any of you gone through similar experiences, and how did you overcome them? I'd love to hear your suggestions and advice.\n\nThanks for listening.",

I literally just came out of a nervous breakdown -- one of several in the past few years -- and more and more I am realizing that the increased frequency of these meltdowns coincides with my decreasing tolerance of being someone that I'm not. After years of ignoring the obvious signs, my body finally told me that it isn't going to put up with my shit anymore. Then I was finally forced to confront my truth and my purpose and I had to learn to stop desiring a diffent outcome. I had to start doing the things that made me feel whole and connected to myself, even if it meant sacrificing comfort.\n\nI am very pleased to say I have found a way to honor who I am vs continuously chasing a desire to change. I went through a long process of investigating the possibility of starting a farm, then a 501c3, then finally accepted that I am just trying to simultaneously have a space to be on my personal journey while inviting likeminded folks along. So I am crowdfunding for a project rn that will allow me to do all that and donate food I grow to a local breadbasket. I work an ordinary full-time job, and I've accepted that too and even enjoy work again now that I have this. I've stopped overextending myself in a desperate attempt to get a new job or a promotion. I'm not growth-limited, but I have come to accept that maybe by being who I am and working on projects I deeply care about, I'll get what I deserve. I just thought I'd share this journey because in a world of so much noise, I think what we all really could use more of is self-acceptance and gratitude for what already is.",

        "text": "Whatsup everyone, thank you for reading my post. There's a TL;DR at the end.\n\n**My Background:**\n\nI used to be someone who hadn't really accomplished anything in my life. I was lazy, a terrible elementary school and high school student (failed multiple courses, didn't graduate on time), and an average college student \n\nEvery once in a while, I would have what I call \"productivity bursts\". In these moments, I would decide enough is enough, starting tomorrow I am going to meditate, get better grades, wake up on time, eat healthy, etc\n\nI would stick to the new regiment for maybe a few weeks at most and then fall off again. This pattern led to me basically accomplishing nothing year over year\n\n**Enter The ONE Thing:**\n\nOne day, I came across the book The One Thing by Gary Keller. I read the summary of the book because, tbh, at that point in my life I was not disciplined enough to read a full book and absorb its contents\n\nI highly recommend reading the book (I've done so at this point) but the TL;DR of the book is: Think to yourself, what's the ONE thing that if I was to do it really well, my others concerns/tasks would become miniscule/less relevant/deal with themselves \n\nFor me, at that time, the answer was clear. I had really low self-esteem and didn't like how I looked. I knew that improving my physical looks would improve my self-esteem and my confidence which would end up making a lot of other tasks that I was doing to increase my confidence irrelevant \n\nSo I made fitness my one thing and I committed myself to it. I said that even if I do nothing else productive all day, I will stay on track with my fitness journey \n\n**The Results:**\n\nBy doing this, for the first time in my life I actually accomplished a goal that I had set out to accomplish. In about 6-12 months I saw physical changes in my body. It was significantly easier to stay committed to one thing rather than 20 different things\n\nThis increased my confidence. Prior to starting my fitness journey my thinking about my ability to accomplish my goals was very negative. I would think \"You've committed to doing things in the past and never followed through, what will be different this time?\"\n\nAfter I accomplished my fitness goals I made coding my one thing. This time when I was going into my goal I had a much healthier mindset. I was thinking \"I accomplished a hard goal in fitness, of course I can accomplish a hard goal like learning to code as well\"\n\nI started learning to code in December 2019 and I landed a 6 figure role in August 2021\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR:**\n\nFrom the book The One Thing, I learned that all tasks are not created equal. You can do many tasks all day and get little results OR you can focus on a very small subset of highly impactful tasks and get major results. This concept is similar to the 80/20 rule if any of you are familiar with it \n\nI used to focus on doing too many tasks. I changed my approach by asking myself: What's the ONE thing that if I was to do it really well, my others concerns/tasks would become miniscule/less relevant/deal with themselves \n\nI then focused on only that thing, which was fitness at the start and then coding later on. By focusing on less I found it easier to stay disciplined and consistent and actually accomplish my goal",

Most people by now have tried, and regularly take things like lsd/shrooms/cocaine/mdma etc.  \nThe number of times I've had to endure a social berating and peer pressure for my choice is countless at this point. \n\nBut recently, my partner, who I thought was also not planning to do drugs, has decided she wants to do them and is planning to try some things soon.\n\nIt made me feel a bit strange and I wanted to open up the floor to some more opinions, to help inform how I want to think about this.\n\nObviously the pragmatic side is that it's her life and she can do whatever the fuck she wants. That drugs themselves aren't too bad if kept in moderation and in safe environments with safe people around. The 'drugs r bad mmkay' mantra that has been drilled into us are mostly edge case scenarios where things weren't accounted for carefully when taking them so the risk of an extreme averse, long term reaction is really quite low. That really, your upside for experiencing feelings that are otherwise not possible if you live your life not wanting to take them.\n\nBut then there's my emotionally driven side - I have lasted this long without them. That I think the truly successful people in life aren't the ones that bum around taking party drugs. That I don't need them to live a full life. That I am fearful, that even if there's a 0.001% chance, of experiencing something that ruins my life or has long term effects. That there's a source of pride and identity and ego attached to having chosen not to do it thus far, and if I decide to, it feels as though I'm going against my own beliefs - which is cheap I know, but still. I somehow resonate with the phrases \"fuck that noise\" or \"fuck that shit\", but I don't know why. I fear that my partner would change somehow as a result or start a slippery slope of drug experimentation which I just don't really want a part of for some reason.\n\nIt's not that I think drugs are bad - I fully respect my friends that take things on the regular, would fully support some sensible legalisation. Think there are incredible fields of research available. I have seen one friend's personality completely change on my just from weed so that makes me wary of overdoing it. But for me, I just haven't wanted to.\n\nBut yeah, what are your thoughts and experiences with drugs? Do you think they are good and worth trying? Or do you think they're not necessary in terms of self-improvement?",

I don‚Äôt hit him up all the time, maybe once a week- but he always has an excuse, like he never has an hour to chill with me. \n\nIt sucks because I really like hanging out with him, we have a ton in common and we have a good time whenever we do hang out. Just talking we have a good time, we don‚Äôt even need drugs or alcohol. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where he only hits me up like once every 2 months and it always has to be on his terms. It‚Äôs so hard because I‚Äôve known this guy for 15 years, since we were kids. \n\nWe were best friends not even too long ago. But I just can‚Äôt keep it going. I can‚Äôt guilt or pressure him into wanting to hang out. To him, he‚Äôs never in the wrong and I should feel stupid for even asking him to chill. He‚Äôs never open with what he‚Äôs really feeling, which is insulting because we‚Äôve been through so much together. \n\nAdmittedly, I wasn‚Äôt always the perfect friend- but I‚Äôve always been there for him and to help him and ask nothing in return. In reality I should‚Äôve come to terms with his toxic attitude a long time ago, but it‚Äôs so hard to let go- especially as an adult who hasn‚Äôt had to make friends in a long time. \n\nFortunately, I‚Äôm starting a new job soon and will be taking classes at my local college soon, which will give me more opportunities to meet new people. But as of now, aside from my family- I feel alone. Anyway, thanks for reading my post. If anyone has any wisdom or suggestions for me, I am all ears. \n\nGod bless",

I do take medication to help with adhd. \n\nI recently quit my job as I could tell they were going to fire me soon for being slack. I then started a new job and worked there for 2 weeks before I was fired for being unreliable (partly due to medical reasons, mostly because I wasn‚Äôt trying as hard as I could‚Äôve). \nCurrently I am unemployed, doing the occasional job so that I can scrape by. \n\nI live in a house with my partner who works full time. I wash the dishes, make the bed and do a quick tidy up daily, however I rarely do deep cleans unless I‚Äôm asked to help. \nI rarely cook, and when I do it‚Äôs quick and easy stuff like putting frozen food in an air fryer.\n\nI‚Äôm extremely irresponsible with money, I currently have $20 in my bank account, im a week behind on rent, I owe my partner almost $5000, zip pay $800, a friend of mine $200 and my father $3500.\nThe large sums are due to me asking for a loan to get a ute so I could take on bigger jobs. \n\nI know I need to find another job as my odd jobs aren‚Äôt cutting it, they probably could if I pulled my finger out and tried harder. \n\nMy issue is I feel so bogged down by all of this, I feel like I‚Äôve ruined my life and the hole I‚Äôve dug myself feels too deep to climb out of. I know it‚Äôs not, I know with some hard work and discipline I can make everything right, yet I find myself doing nothing about it.\n\nI absolutely can‚Äôt stand the person I am right now. I feel so sorry for my partner of 4 years. She‚Äôs such a hard working, responsible and caring person. I feel like I‚Äôm dragging her down. I want to be better for her, she deserves the best. \n\nI work up some motivation and the second something goes wrong I go back into this cave of self indulgence and negligence. \nIt‚Äôs almost like any amount of discomfort in my life is unbearable to me. All i want to do is drink beer, smoke cigarettes and play video games. \n\nI need to pull myself out of this before I lose everything I love.\nAny advice on what I can do to change my mindset and pull myself out of this hole would be very much appreciated.\nI‚Äôm very aware of the few things I need to do to get my life back on track, I guess I‚Äôm just asking if it‚Äôs normal to feel so miserable doing the things every other adult seems to do naturally. And if not, where do I start. \n\nThank you for your time.",
