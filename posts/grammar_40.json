I have consulted various reliable sources, but remain uncertain of the predominant rules governing the structure and punctuation used in a paragraph such as this.

The project assistant was asking all of the appropriate questions, including, \"What flavors do you prefer?\", \"What time will the party begin?\", and, \"What do you hope our service will bring to your event?\". Maude's responses invariably resembled or included, \"no\", \"none\", or \"I don't care\".\n\nSee my problem? I'm trying to incorporate multiple quotes (or partial quotes) into a sentence, but it's just not looking right. I think I might be going comma-kaze. I realize the second and third sentences display different approaches... but because the usage is a bit different. Read aloud, I think the paragraph *sounds* fine. I just don't know how to make it *look* fine.\n\nAll thoughts and feedback would be appreciated -- except for mean ones or ones that suck.\n\nThank you, Redditors!",
