Yet they almost always have a \"48V Phantom Power\" option, how is it able to create 48 volts from a port that can't provide 48 volts? \n\n----\n\nAnother example of this is electrified fly swatters (those ones that look like tennis rackets). I once had one that took 2x AA 1.5V batteries, yet the output voltage on the swatter was significantly more than the batteries provided. \n\n----\n\nI know electricity can only be transferred, not destroyed, but I don't understand how it could do this. Because if it's taking 5V or 3V and turning it into 48V or however much more, isn't that creating power? \n\n----\n\nI've probably always overthought how it works which is why I've never understood it.",

This trend seems to have been passed down for centuries to the point that the free market has not rebalanced how much an IT worker in India gets paid for the same amount of work as an IT worker say in the United States. Then there's no wonder that when we go into a developing country, it seems like everything is so cheap and we can afford to live like kings and pay the locals to shine our shoes or carry our luggage around.\n\nThis seems very weird to me. For example, suppose that we encounter an alien race and the exchange rate is set arbitrarily so that our dollars are worth very little compared to their currency. Couldn't those aliens then set up a company on Earth and buy up our goods and services for cheap (when it comes to their currency) and make us their servants while we are happily earning above market rates by working for the alien company? This seems to be the exact same thing that happens in developing companies when locals are happily employed by the foreign company while making much less than the same worker in the West for the same work.",
