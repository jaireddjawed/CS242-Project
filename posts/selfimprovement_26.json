After the heat of the Summer, calm of the Fall, cold of Winter, Spring comes again. This can be said of any season, so why is Spring special? Is it because spring follows Winter, and comes before Summer? And what of Fall? It does the opposite. Is it a harbinger of the cold future, a remembrance of the hot past? Or is it the comfort between the desert and arctic?\n\nThe answers to these questions, I do not know. But I am uncomfortable with the way I am and act. And Spring has captivated humanity for generations. So I‚Äôll use it as an excuse to improve myself\n\nIt is the perfect season (at least start) to improve one‚Äôs self.\n\nGood Luck to All",

I'm just tired of feeling like this. I also keep a lot to myself, and my fiance doesn't quite know the extent of my feelings in my head. We lost my mom 9 years ago (she was only 60), and it has been very hard for me to deal with after these years. Then my fiance's mom passed in 2018, and then I just recently lost my grandma 9 days before Christmas (she was my last living grandparent). \nI apologize for a little ranting, but I would kindly appreciate any advice that would help me.

I don't feel like cleaning, cooking, putting away laundry, etc. Even if I have the energy, I get overwhelmed with all the things I need to do and I convince myself it's okay to just relax for a bit until I've spent all day relaxing and get too tired to do anything. I have found a couple of ways to combat this, one of the best being to break things into small steps. Just run the dish water. Just boil some water. Just bring the laundry upstairs. If I have homework to do? Just open the laptop. These bite-sized tasks help me to accomplish the full task. \n\nBut I still need help being more productive. And one thing is that I feel the most motivated at night, when even after completing one thing, I am tired. And even if I'm not so sleepy that I can't do anything else, I still feel like I need to get to bed because I have work in the morning and I don't want to be exhausted throughout the day, and be too tired for anything when I get home from work. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nI've always been a night person. I like all-nighters, I like how still the world feels while everyone else is sleeping (yes, I know the world doesn't work like that, it's just the vibe), and I don't feel like I actually have to do anything. It just feels like me time. \n\nI have been trying for a long time to change my routine to waking up an hour and a half earlier in the morning to give myself more time to start my day, and get the working out and studying out of the way earlier so it's not hanging over my head all day. But despite all the tricks I've been trying to get myself up earlier, I just haven't been able to get myself out of bed any earlier than I have to. I'm constantly amazed that I make it to work every morning at all because I hate getting out of bed in the morning!\n\nSo my question is, is it possible for a night person to change into a morning person? Or am I better off trying to find ways to accommodate my nighttime energy by just scheduling tasks for the evening and going to sleep late? What has worked for you?",

        "text": "I (18M) have a super amazing situation. I'm in a long distance relationship of almost 2 years. I have a job playing video games. I'm currently living away from home. I cook for myself, clean for myself, take care of myself. I've been going to the gym. I'm going to move in with my girlfriend in about four months. On paper I'm on the right path but it all feels so messed up in my head.  \nI love playing video games professionally. Video games are fun. I'm completely fine with the stress, anxiety, and the competition. What messes me up is my mental health. My confidence get's hit extremely hard when I lose. Losing fucking sucks. I want to get better at the game so I can keep climbing in the ranks and get a higher paying salary. I want to become insanely good at the game. There's so much more for me to get better at and I want it very badly. For the money, for the ego, for the enjoyment. I just lose my mind when I lose. I am seeing amazing mindset changes in the past few months of me moving out.  \nThings are going my way, but here's where lifestyle comes into place. I jerk off maybe once every day. I have an addiction to videos of hot girls on Tiktok, onlyfans girls, and Hentai. It's really messing with my head. It's extremely fucked up because I work on my computer and there's easy access to all of my addictions. It's three clicks and two lines of text and boom, I'm sucked into my addiction. Even while I'm working, it will throw me off if some trigger happens. Even if there's the slightest hint of hormones making me horny, I start fighting myself and use the internet to feed my addiction. When I'm ready to go to bed at around 1 am, I stay up an extra one or two hours just browsing through the internet until I unwillingly let one out. The worst part about all of this is I often tell myself \"I won't fap off today\" and I still end up doing it, making me lose self respect for myself. I feel terrible after I fap, and my dopamine levels are also off the charts. When I wake up, I don't want to do anything. I'll stay in bed and nothing will motivate me unless someone gets me up. The only method I've come across that gets me up recently is by fapping in the morning. I hate this sick cycle. I hate it so much. I love being motivated. I love my passion. I love grinding and becoming the best version of myself, but I just feel so stuck.  \nI love my girlfriend so much. She's so supportive and is literally always there for me. When she comes to visit, we have sex every day. The thing is, she is very open to my sexual kinks and supports everything I enjoy. She tells me it's okay to fap and watch whatever I like, especially because we're long distance, so it really messes with me. I've acknowledged that fapping and watching this content is not helpful for me, and is actually ruining things. Every time I talk to her about it, she's so positive about it and tells me it's no big deal. She is a big part of my life and has helped me change my mindset into a much more positive one, but I am struggling to draw the line between rational thoughts and just going with how I'm feeling.\n\nI feel like I have no control over myself sometimes.",

I almost always end up in relationships with the most attractive people that will date me... and often they end up having emotional stability issues. The obvious solution is for me to weight appearance less heavily and stability more heavily in my choice of relationships (in other words I need to be less vain than I am), but I find that I don't fall in love with the less attractive people I date, and I DO fall in love with the less stable more attractive ones.  \n\n\nAny idea on what I might do about this?

I‚Äôm adaptable and find that I can be good at anything I try, as long as I work hard. I prize myself on this, but think it may be hurting me in that it feels impossible to find my path! Are there exercises or meditations to explore this further? Anyone to talk to to help me realize what might work for me in terms of a career and visualizing my future?\n\nI feel as if I want to take the steps to move forward in my life, but suddenly have no idea what forward even looks like!",

True self-love isn't about what you can buy, it's about what you can do.\n\nIt's about taking care of your physical and mental health, practicing self-compassion, and investing in activities that bring long-term benefits. Whether it's exercise, mindfulness, learning new skills, or pursuing personal goals that light a fire within, true self-love comes from within and is a commitment to growth and well-being.\n\nSo don't fall for the trap of material possessions and instant gratification. Instead, focus on the things that will truly make you feel good about yourself and bring a sense of purpose and fulfillment to your life. That's the kind of self-love that lasts a lifetime.",

        "text": "I think a lot of people will probably relate to my problem which is basicaly being in my 20s having nothing figured out. I am desperate to find any purpose to my life and I don‚Äôt know where to start so I need to know what to do.\n\nMore about me:\n\nI grew up in a wealthy environment. We were never too rich but money was never an issue in my family and I am very grateful for that. I am 22 years old and I am about to complete my university degree which is electronic engineering. It is a very useful degree and I know a lot of people would want to have the opportunities that I had and be where I am, but it's not what I would rather be doing.\n\nThe problem is that I don't have an interest in what I'm studying and even though I don't hate it, I don't \"like\" it either and I hate going to class to learn about things I don't care about. The reason why I continue this path is because I don't know what other thing I could be doing instead because I don't find anything else interesting. \n\nI have other things I like besides my degree but I don't think i can make a living out of them. The thing I like to do the most is playing guitar (actually I am in a band and it would be my dream job, but making a living with music is impossible). I also like to play videogames, biking and traveling (how original xd).\n\nI also think it's worth to mention I always lived on a mountain in the outskirts of a town and I always loved living in a big house with my own garden and pool, surrounded by mountains... But now I live in one of the best cities of my country (because I am in university) and I absolutely hate it. I am a huge introvert and I hate being around so many people. I would much rather live in my parent's house so I could blast loud music during the day without bothering anybody and going out for a walk in the mountains with very few people (or nobody) around me.\n\nI would be willing to leave everything behind and start a new life on another corner of the planet if I knew what to do, but the problem is I don't. I'm pretty sure if i keep going with my degree I will end up having a job I hate, but if I drop it i would have nothing else to do and my situation could probably be worse. I don't have any reason to get up in the morning or anything to be excited for, so if somebody can help me with this situation or tell me how to get the help I need, that would be very appreciated.",

        "text": " Two days ago I went to a carnival party with my friends. It was the first time this year that I drank alcohol but that‚Äôs fine because at the beginning it was my goal to not drink until carnival and then only once with my friends. That‚Äôs exactly what I did. However, I always get pretty bad hangovers, even when I only have a few drinks.\n\nSo, as expected, the next day I had a hangover. It was by not one of the worse ones but I slept quite badly and was up until 3 am. Naturally, I wasn‚Äôt excited to start the day with some meditation. As the day continued I felt sorry for myself because the party wasn‚Äôt really worth it and now I have wasted a Sunday by drinking the day before.\n\nOn top of that I bruised a rip last week, so even hitting the gym to get my circulation going wasn‚Äôt a realistic option on a day that I thought was useless the day before.\n\nSo I indulged in my bad habits and didn‚Äôt do any of the good ones I implemented over the last few months.\n\nBut here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm different now than I was before when I had previously fallen off the wagon. Back then I felt sorry for myself because all my streaks are gone and I have to start over again‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyes, that‚Äôs how I thought back then. And I rationalized that if my streak was zero anyways I might enjoy myself for a few days. And suddenly I was back in my old instant gratification routine.\n\nThis time, however, I managed to break that cycle. I got up this morning and meditated like I used to. I went to work and did my thing there, and afterwards is where I feel proud of now. I already told my gym buddy that I wouldn‚Äôt make it today, but then I went anyways. I worked out my legs lightly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause I had to fight the pain in my ribs‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätalked to some of my gym friends, took a shower and ate a healthy meal. Now I am writing and after this I‚Äôll briefly journal. Then I‚Äôll have followed the worst possible day in terms of new habits with a perfect one. This feels great. I feel like I improved my willpower today by a lot.\n\nAnd to be honest, the one day I missed yesterday isn‚Äôt too bad. It doesn‚Äôt really make a difference in anything. It would have made one, if I didn‚Äôt manage to get back on track so quickly. That‚Äôs my new mindset. One day doesn‚Äôt matter! No matter if that‚Äôs regarding good or bad habits. If you are consistently doing the good habits to a sufficient degree, one day can‚Äôt harm you.",

A god who themselves requires constant thought, daily thanks, and at least some weekly praise. We went to church because we were sinners, and becoming worthy of heaven was a catch-22. Thinking highly of one's self was seen as vain, but thinking lowly of one's self was seen as humble, no matter the context. The only way the cult taught self worth was to see yourself as more obedient than others, and in constant agonizing competition.\n\nNow I'm an adult, separated from the cult, but I still feel like a bad person and many events in my life confirm how bad of a person I must be. At this point I only exist because I'm a tool to those whom I care about. I'm a piggy bank to my mother, an ear to vent to to my sisters,  a second parent to my youngest brothers, and a can opener for the family pets. I'm nothing to myself and live a teeny tiny life that is somehow still bigger than me.",

Plus I discovered I have an anxious attachment style with women. I'd like book suggestions or advice. \n\n\nSo I started my self improvement journey about 10 years ago. I was ruthless and determined and calculated. It has paid off. I went from scrounging for groceries and being extremely depressed all the time to: now I own my own home, just paid off my nice (middle class type vehicle), I have a killer savings, I own 2 businesses, I have upped my social skills, I've went from 310lbs to 220 and I'm still losing and about to start lifting. Everything's pretty great except one thing: \n\nI'm a nihilist.  I used anger and sadness as my motivator. I think everyone has an agenda and I'm I realized I have an anxious attachment style in relationships which ruins any chances I have at them.  \n\nI'm pretty sure I can stay motivated off \"momentum\" now, but the negative world view of others is hard to get rid of, and I've isolated myself A LOT - although its been getting better.The anxious attachment issue though, im at a complete loss as to how to combat that. \n\nFor all this stuff + my depression I tried therapy and it's a joke.  The therapists I've seen are the absolute worst. For example the last one I had told me the rapture was coming and we were halfway through the book of revelations. I'm an atheist.  Lol.  \n\nAny advice, books, anything like that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

Every time I bring up the concept of bettering themselves, theyll rely with ‚Äúwomen dont care about that‚Äù. As if everything they do is for women‚Äôs approval. I workout daily, not for women. I want to be financially successful, not for women. I want to be outgoing and articulate, not for women. \n\nIts extremely lonely and difficult when the important people in your life refuse to work on themselves and look down on you for being better than them.

This year I have no obligations like school or university since I finished school last year and I'm taking this one off to really figure out what to do with my life. Should I dedicate this year to self improvement fully or should I try to find this purpose? I want to do so many things right now such as figuring out how to start a business, improving myself, finding my purpose, getting better socially etc. That I don't know how to balance my time or what to really focus on this year, what are you guy's thoughts? what should I do?",

        "text": "I wasn't exactly sure where this post could go. It's majorly a rant.\n\nSo today I had my graduation ceremony. My parents flew in to attend it and that's a pretty big deal because we're not financially all that great and the tickets cost a lot. I wasn't even sure if anybody from home could make it, so it was a lovely moment when I got to know that both my parents are coming. It was just a really happy moment for the entire family. Dad, Mom and my brother who couldn't make it because of work. They were all just really proud and happy for me.\n\nBefore the ceremony, it was important for everyone to collect their marksheets of the final semester. I head there and find out that I haven't cleared one of my re-exams that I had given the previous semester since I didn't pass in that subject's exam. This information was not conveyed to me in any way for 6 fucking months. I was even allowed to sit for my finals, which I cleared with decent marks. Now because of this, I'm not eligible to get my degree till I pass another test for the same subject.\n\nI booked my tickets for home a month back to get them as cheap as possible. They've been booked for the 4th of October because I wanted to surprise my mom on her birthday. I haven't been around for her birthday in 3 years now. And now I've been told that the re-exam will mostly happen some time in October, either on the 16th or 17th. I've got my return ticket booked for the 28th.\n\nMy parents and my brother have no clue about this because I'm too fucking scared to tell them. It's breaking my heart that I'll be disappointing them so much with this news. Today was supposed to be a good day. My parents couldn't stop smiling and talking about their college days. My brother has been nothing but proud of me. He even gave me his camera as my graduation gift. In a month's time I was supposed to be home with my family, giving a big birthday surprise to my mom. Now, I just feel like a fucking fraud. I hated being in that graduation gown, wearing my graduation cap, being called on stage to receive my fake degree because I was too stupid to not even be able to pass all my papers. My entire batched deserved this ceremony, but I didn't.\n\nThe last couple of months have already been harsh. I just got out of a very toxic relationship that was fucked up on so many levels that it still messes with my head to the point where I can't help but just breakdown. Work's been getting more difficult to handle. And now this. I just feel like I'm hitting the kind of low I've not experienced in a long time. I'm just being a disappointment to myself and the people around me. My family is going to be so disappointed in me for this.\n\nI know there's no point in this but thanks for hearing me out anyway you guys. I just needed to vent out.\n\nEDIT: Even though I've had this account for more than a year, I've only recently been using it actively. I had no clue what a platinum was. I just checked it out and I can't believe someone was so nice enough to reward me one. Everyone has been nothing but nice to me here and I'm so so grateful to everyone. I'm currently waiting to drop my parents off at the airport. Once I'm done, I'll reply to everyone. Thank you so much for all your kind words!",

Its like I know that my  worries are meaningless but there is just this side of my mind that keeps tellng me that my worries are facts. Idk how to stop this problem at all. Usually the only way I relief myself from my worries is asking a doctor for anything dealing with health, factory resetting with anything dealing with malware and for the other stuff I go on websites like reddit or quora to ask annonymous ppl. Praying helps too but sometimes I just pray for useless shit. Honestly, I have no clue how to stop this problem so I am here to ask for help.

        "text": "Your brain is born to survive, not to thrive. Over the past 10,000 years, the brain has developed itself into a very advanced surviving machine, that no matter what the problem is it can actually survive, or find a way to solve it.\n\nNow consider this situation, you want to work on your personal project that‚Äôll give you benefits after 2-3 years, want to learn a language that requires 1-2 years of dedicated hard-work. But all this to the brain seems useless, because it cannot process the long-term goals, for it getting instant happiness is the key to survival. Consider the situation long ago when you were in a cave, getting the food and eating it was the key to survival, then at times storing some food dinner or a day seem to be long term planning, that too was rare and usually during the winters. The major cause of this was that the chance of getting killed was very high. You could have been attacked by a sabre tooth, mammoth, crunched by a crocodile. So, long term planning was useless, as you wouldn‚Äôt live long enough. So, eat now, enjoy now, drink now, play now. Fast forward 17th,19th &amp; 20th Century, the world wars, and wars of independence, again the same problem. You can get killed by a bomb, bullet etc. Or if not, there are disease like plague, etc. to wipe you out. Average human life span 40-50 years. Now, consider the lifestyle from the past 30 years, things have changed rapidly, doctors and medicines are there to save you, govt. is there to protect you, you have rights, you have houses, there are no wars, going outside your house. So, things are not the way it used to be, but the brain cannot unlearn the 10,000 years of education that was passed onto you by your ancestors, your brain is still the same, survive now, eat now. News adds stuff to the survival instinct, saying about how many people die in car accidents and all, affects your brain.\n\nThe brain cannot understand why work for 8 hours a day, for 5 years in a row? Why work for something that may or may not happen in the future? The lifestyle has changed but our brain remains the same. So, whenever you feel the urge for eating that doughnut in the fridge, postponing the workout, leaving the studies for tomorrow, remind yourself and your brain, that this is the new survival instinct, this is how people now have to survive, cause you‚Äôre going to live long enough and you may not be able to work then to feed yourself, so it‚Äôs better to save some money, do some extra work else later in life there will be suffering, pain and anxiety which are the new diseases now. So, better plan and do the work. Survival instincts that are 10,000-year-old doesn‚Äôt help you much in new age. So better start the thing you want to.\n\nSo, the new survival instincts will be, work hard towards a new plan, work with the future in mind, because if you don‚Äôt work now. In the future you will be broke, depressed and probably be dead. Remind yourself of this every day.\n\nTL/DR:- Our brain is wired for instant gratification as it can't comprehend our long life and certain safe future.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm pretty guilty of this, I will wait until I‚Äôm inspired to take healthy actions but the truth of the matter is that sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve waited around for inspiration for months only to find it didn‚Äôt come in the way I expected, no burst of magical energy that helped me do the tasks that I‚Äôve been trying to do for a while but couldn‚Äôt get myself to do.\n\nThis morning, I got out of bed earlier than I wanted to. When I‚Äôm really on a roll getting out of bed is easy but I‚Äôm in the beginning phases once again of cleaning up my daily actions and creating a life full of health and energy. The inspiration didn‚Äôt come naturally. It was forced honestly. I got out of bed groggy and tired but I turned on the meditation anyway. My eyes were basically shut from being tired and I wrote after anyway. Sometimes inspiration isn‚Äôt something that comes in a divine way. Sometimes it‚Äôs something you have to create. Overtime it does get easier, I‚Äôve experienced it before. Overtime the natural abilities start to align together once again and things start to fall together. But if you‚Äôre waiting for inspiration to eat healthy, get out of bed, meditate, do yoga, workout, write, or whatever habit you know is going to help you, you might wait forever. Sometimes you have to push yourself. For me, motivation hasn‚Äôt been a starting point, it‚Äôs a continuous line that only kicks off once I‚Äôve forced the starting point.\n\nToday I invite you to do something different today that you haven‚Äôt done before, maybe because you‚Äôve been waiting for inspiration that never came or the perfect moment and energy to start. Now is the perfect moment, it just might not look at all like it on the surface. Now when I hear my mind try to talk me out of doing something good for me I ask myself, will I be grateful in a year if I work on this practice consistently? If the answer is yes, even if I‚Äôm tired, even if i don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôm doing the thing because I know it can be the best decision of my life.\n\nSending y‚Äôall love and hope you have a great day.",

I've been noticing a lot of qualities about myself that I didn't particularly like, but instead of ever doing something about it, I kind of just pretended that these traits about myself didn't exist.  \nYesterday I caught up with my ex, and while it was a great conversation overall, there was a moment/comment she told me about that really jerked my insides.  \nA few weeks ago, I ran into one of my ex's friends at a concert, and in my drunken state did something that made me seem like \"i just wanted attention.\" Her friend told my ex to never talk to me again.\n\nI think the reason why this comment set me off so much is because I know it's true. I care so much about what people think about me, and I really do enjoy getting positive external attention from people. I think it also hurts because I like to give off the impression that I don't care what people think about me, but the moment someone thinks negatively of me, I freak the fuck out.  \nI used to be so internally fixed on receiving social media likes and garnering attention from my actions. For example, I knew things like being a Resident Assistant at college garners a lot of respect, but I never really enjoyed the job. I'm conscious and aware that a lot of peers look up to me (not trying to state this in a cocky way), but I'm also conscious that all of this just boosts my ego.\n\nI want to just learn how to be content and satisfied with just myself and not be so driven/addicted by external validation from people I probably wont even see once I graduate college. I feel like a little narcissistic, self-absorbed, and shallow person from caring about these kinds of things.

I keep up on medications, I brush my damn hair, I eat foods other than raw cookie dough, I want to do well in school, I want to use my brain and these are all things I never realized I was missing out on.\n\nI‚Äôm in a weird phase where I have a lot of restless energy that I‚Äôm trying to direct but I think a lot of it is based in the fact that this is the longest amount of time I‚Äôve gone in my life without wanting to die. I actually really don‚Äôt want to die. I don‚Äôt feel the need to go out and experience \\~everything\\~ but I‚Äôm excited about the idea of walking in the grass tomorrow and finishing my art final and making a really good smoothie for breakfast. It‚Äôs really small things but it‚Äôs small things I‚Äôve never cared about.\n\nI care and that‚Äôs the biggest change. I care about myself. I just wanted to share. I‚Äôve lurked on here for a while and I wanted to say thanks to everyone who participates here. You do help people.\n\nIf any of y‚Äôall need anything hmu. Things can suck and you feel small, but you gotta meet yourself where you are. So start small. Go team, have a great week :)",

I get up some mornings with no problem and turn it off and go. Other mornings I snooze it and all of a sudden it‚Äôs time to leave for work.
