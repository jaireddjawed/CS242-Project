Years ago I was in a course where they teached me a bit of web development, but I wouldn't even count that. \n\nSorry, let's go to the main topic. After watching lots of videos about the different languages and possibilities, I have decided that I would like to make apps for phones, because whenever I have an idea it's for a phone's app. I'm thinking about learning Kotlin, but then discovered Flutter. I personally use Android and it's what I'm used to, so Kotlin is the thing for me, but Flutter would make my apps reach more people. However it seems that it has many disadvantages, and what's more, it usually has a core using flutter and dart with specifics done in Kotlin and Swift. So I thinking about starting with Kotlin and then after getting good enough with it try to learn Flutter. \n\nI know the post is too long winded and my English isn't the best (I'm not native), but I would be thankful if anyone could share their opinion about the topic :)",
