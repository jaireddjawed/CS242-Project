        "text": "I work at a janky-ass local chain that is full of drama. Most of that comes from my boss, the district manager, Paul, one of the most bizarre people I've ever had the (mis)forturne to be acquainted with. He is sketchy and brazen and just a huge liability that, in any other company, would've been fired eons ago. (Please see my previous post on him for some more info) He is also a drugged up, alcohol'd up motherfucker who is absolutely insane. He is very entertaining if you're not on the wrong side of his tirades.\n\n\nHe tends to evoke a lot of emotion not just from staff, but from customers who form very strong opinions on him, too! Like this one lady.\n\n\n\nOne night, I got a phone call from a woman. It went something like this:\n\n\nMe: Ratchet Pizza on Willow Rd, this is Pizzabastard, what can I do for you today?\n\nHer: Look, I know that this is the Willow Rd store and not the Kings Rd store, but I want to talk to you for a moment. I ordered a delivery from the Kings Rd store and I...I just need to vent. Is a manager there?\n\nMe: I am (unfortunately) the manager here, actually.\n\nWoman: Great. Look, I received an order- the man on the phone had told me it would be 45 minutes and it took over an hour. When I got the food, the pizza was cold!! I called back and they told me it would take over an hour to re-deliver a new one, so I just hung up on them! \n\nMe: Well...okay...um, did you try to call back Kings Rd-\n\nWoman: I did! And some man who was claiming to be the manager answered, and let me just tell you, he was very rude! In fact, I don't think he was actually the manager at all!\n\nMe: (I'm willing to bet it was) Did he give you his name, ma'am?\n\nWoman: It was Paul or something.\n\nMe: (LOL inside) I'm so sorry to hear that, ma'am, is there anything we can do for y-\n\nWoman: Look. I don't want to call them back. I want you to give them this message. I don't want any remade food. I don't care. I am going to kill that man. I have two children and I am ready to go to jail tonight over this\n\nMe: (holy shit)\n\nWoman: I am going to be going up there in a few minutes with my husband, and we are going to take him out into the parking lot, and I am going to kill him. I will shoot that man.\n\nMe: (Speechless)\n\n\n\nWith that, she hung up the phone and ended the call. I immediately called my boss to tell him what had just happened. \n\n\n\nMe: Paul, some woman just called me and told me she is coming up there to shoot you.\n\nPaul: What?\n\nMe: Yeah, you took some order and she tripped out about how long the remake would take?\n\nPaul: Huh? Kill me? On a Friday night? I'm too busy. Fuck that bitch, I'd like to see her try. I'm not afraid to die. Anyway, I need to go right now, I'm short a cook and I have to go help on the line and-\n\nMe: Uh, I'm going to call the cops because she made a threat on your life, so-\n\nPaul: Don't call the fucking cops! I need to go, bye.\n\n\nAnd he hung up on me. \n\n\nTurns out that either the woman was bluffing, or maybe they talked it out, because nobody died. \n\nOr maybe she killed my boss and I've been working for his vengeful spirit since then.\n(I accept this possibility)\n\n",

        "text": "Getting stiffed is a fact of life at my store, and we have several neighborhoods notorious for it. We also have several unique types of stiff that happen occasionally and the drivers all warn each other of exactly who does it. These are three I've had happen to me, although there are others, of course. You all can probably add a ton more. \n\nFirst is the fill in the blank guys. These are the people that rather than leaving the tip line on the receipt blank or writing a zero, they'll write 'cash' instead, then give nothing. They do that so you won't ask for a tip because you see them writing something on the line and by the time you realize there's no numbers on the ticket, the door's shut.\n\nThe second one are the instruction guys. The customer opens the door (generally accompanied by a young child) and ask if they can tip on the card because they have no cash. I tell them they can, then they give me back the slip folded up and say thanks for the help, they made it worth my while. So naturally when I check it, there's a big fat zero on the line.  \n\nThen there's the declined card stiff. There are two versions of this: a normal declined card, and an undeliverable. It works the same both ways: the customers signs for the food and puts on a good tip, knowing full well I can't get it b/c it's a bad card. No idea why I'm allowed to take food if the card was declined, especially since I work for a chain. I guess they just don't care too much about it, and it's only internet orders that allow it. For an undeliverable, the customer doesn't open the door or answer the phone, forcing me to take it back to the store. The customer waits for the order to be voided, then calls wanting their food about 3-5 minutes after I walk in the door. So I have to take it to them, and they insist on signing the ticket and they put a $5+ tip on it knowing they won't have to pay. I always inform the manager whenever this happens, but I don't know the store's policy for credit card fraud so I don't know if anything ever happened. I have two stories about undeliverables that ended this way, if you want to hear. \n\nBonus one: the Pizza Guy. I've delivered to pizza guys/girls before, both people working for my company (different store) or others. They're always real friendly, and we swap stories during the transaction. But they always betray me. The highest tip I've ever gotten from a fellow driver is $2. Fellow drivers, if you can't afford a good tip don't order delivery, especially past close. \n\nIf you want to hear more, I can tell you about the Dual-Card Guys, the extra drink guy, or the Break a 100 people.

        "text": "This story happened many years ago. I just remembered it, so I thought I'd share.\n\nFirst, a little backstory. The place I worked at had recently changed their barbecue wings. All flavors of wing used to come in pre-made and frozen and were deep fried. We had some issues with the barbecue, so we started getting raw wings and baking them in the oven. Since they were baked they would inevitably have a little burn, but were a big hit since they were higher quality than the other flavors.\n\nI got an order of these barbecue wings up for delivery. I knew the house and it was nobody's favorite, they barely tipped and the concrete slab between the house and sidewalk was always a dog shit minefield. But we had never had any real issues with them.\n\nUpon returning from my trip I was slightly surprised to learn that they wanted new wings because the ones we sent were supposedly burnt. It had been explained that they just had a little char because of the way we cook them, so we exchanged them for our regular cheap-o frozen wings.\n\nWhen I got there, as we were trading bags, the lady who ordered made sure to express her disdain for the food. This is when she uttered the titular line (which still haunts and confuses me to this day), \"These are disgusting! I wouldn't feed them to my grandmother!\" ",

Pizza guy is super stoked, talks about what a big fan of fighting games he is, says he never played it so he sits down with us for a couple of rounds, takes a couple hits off of the uh... tabacco pipe were passing around. more friends come over, its starting to turn into a good time. we're having some fun, says hes gotta go. we tell him come on back after work if he wants to chill. really nice guy. he leaves. we realized we didnt tip and then... o shit didnt even pay for the pizza.  \n  \n  it gets around early evening(i think was like 8 or 9), pizza guy comes back! he drinks with us chills, tells us about his life where he used to live etc. told us no problem on the money for the pizza he took care of it. at this time our get-together is getting to full on party mode, people are playing drinking games, tabacco is very prevalent. He ends partying too hard to get home. end of the night comes, great times, someone gives him a ride to his house, guy says he'll uber back for his car tomorrow. I didnt go full fun mode as some of the other people there so i drive my self home.  \n  \n  start playing around on the internet before and get to thinking. does that kinda stuff happen a lot to delivery people? is it rare for delivery people to meet new friends on route or it something that happens all the time? how did he cover the pizza? was it out of his own pocket? seems like a cool job for those employed in the delivery business, not that im thinking about doing it, im gainfully employed and i suck at driving. It just never something that i really though about in that line of work, the fact that you will come across so many people and meet random strangers and might possibly get wrapped up in what theyre doing.",

        "text": "I used to work at a popular chain pizza place. Not anymore thankfully. As everyone who works in food, pizza especially, knows weekends are the busiest time, and Friday’s are usually the craziest. With really large orders, obviously we like to get them in advance. \nOne Friday night, during football season I might add, a woman called at 4:00 pm to place a delivery order for 120 cheese and pepperoni pizzas to be ready by 5:00 pm. My manager wasn’t about to turn down the money from this order, which turned out to be over $1000, so we got to work. \n\nKeep in mind, there were already tons of orders on the screen, and it was only going to get worse as it got closer to dinner rush. We gathered everyone possible, all in store employees, drivers who weren’t working, and all managers. This is amazing, considering the managers usually just sat around in the office. Dough was being rolled and stretched, two people sauced dough skins, and seven people passed the pizzas down to be cheesed and then pepperonied. We were working crazy fast. I’ve truly never seen such great team work. Then we had to figure out how to load all the pizzas. There are only two oven belts, each about 4 ft wide, so we were trying fit all these pizzas, plus the ones from other orders, onto these belts as quickly as possible. We were running out places to put all the pizzas. Every rack was filled, all carts were filled. We just kept loading and loading. It felt like it went on for ever. It took us about 45 minutes to complete the order, and considering  dough prep, assembly, bake time, and cutting, isn’t bad imo. It took 3 drivers two or so trips to deliver the order. Needless to say, I’m so glad I left that job. Hungry people are mean, and I don’t come home smelling like olives and onions anymore. \n\n**For clarities sake, we didn’t make 120 pizzas all at once. Probably more like 110. We usually have some cheese and pepperoni already made at busy times. \n\nEdit: grammar and such",

        "text": "Every few months, we have a Jamaican who obviously is not within the US, judging by the area code he dials from. He orders a pizza and sends it to the same address. It is the address of a local woman who fell for his scam, sent him hundreds of dollars on multiple occasions, then finally figured out it was a scam and quit. This gentleman was so outraged by her refusal to send him her money, he started calling us to send her pizzas she didn't want. \n\nHe's been doing this for YEARS, now. Because of high turnover at all levels and poor communication, he's been getting driver's relentlessly knocking at this poor lady's door without repercussion of any kind until recently. Our current GM finally got a handle on this after 3 years. She finally had the brilliant idea to tag her address in our system notifying that it is a scam. \n\nI don't know what's more impressive- this man's undying vindictiveness or our company's inability to acknowledge and rectify the problem.",

        "text": " So this was close to 20 years ago.   Worked for one of the main chains so we had the 'satisfaction guarantee'.  Basically if you were unhappy with your pizza for any reason we'd give you a free one.  Some customers knew this and took advantage.   We were a corporate store so we had to abide.  \nI worked the somewhat slow day shift as the only driver.    I believe it was some kind of holiday because school was out.  Which meant shit head kids would be ordering and guaranteed sub par tips.   Early afternoon got 3 orders so we made them,  packed them up and i got on the road.   The first delivery was about a 10 min drive.  We just started using the heat wave bags (i think that's what they were called)  which were the bags that had a heating element in them so they were plugged in at the store and unplugged when we took them.  I made my other 2 deliveries and went back to the store.  When i got back the inside employee told me the first order called and complained they were ice cold (its funny how they're always 'ice' cold not just cold).  Since this was the first order i delivered, we had these new bags (that would burn your arm if you were standing at a door waiting for some schmuck), and it really wasn't a far delivery i knew they were just scamming a free pizza.  Plus it was 2 early teen kids (the kids always abused the policy).  So i said I'd make the pizza to make sure it was hot.    I smacked up the dough and swirled the sauce on.   Then i took the hottest buffalo wing sauce we had (which by today's standards wasn't really too bad) and squeezed a third of the bottle on.   Then the cheese.  Then cooked and delivered with complete professionalism.   Made sure it was the first delivery again.   Hadn't heard any complaints after that.  \n Then probably about 6 hours later (dinner time rush or so) my manager called me over said he got a call that some kids got a pizza earlier that was dangerously spicy with hot peppers all over it.   He said his friend took a bite and was 'gasping for air' it was so hot.   He asked me if i knew anything about it.   So i told him,  'Yeah. They said the pizza was ice cold and i knew otherwise so to make sure it was hot I threw hot sauce all over it but i didn't put any jalapenos or anything so again,  they're lying.'\nHe gave me the side eye like he's annoyed but he understood.   Anyway they were getting another pizza and i was to bring the other pizza back so he could see the hot peppers all over it.  (Usually we wouldn't take the pizza back but he told them he wanted to see it).\nI delivered it personally, for the third time,  because i wanted to see the little pricks face.  I then brought back the pizza and showed my manager the pizza.  He looked at it smirked at me and tossed it in the garbage.   I guess they were satisfied with that one. \n\nPs: one of the funniest/nastiest things i saw there.   One night we were cutting most of the drivers so we were doing our cleaning and what not.   I was at a prep table and my friend Scott calls my name\n'Hey Yaryar, check this out!'\nI turn to see him with his zipper down,  nut sack pulled out as he's scrubbing a deep dish lid with it.  I almost pissed myself.   \nYes i know these were asshole antics and some one could have had an allergic reaction and all that shit but we were 19 and we found this truly entertaining.   So no need to tell me how stupid and gross this was.  This tale is for the drivers that know how out is. ",

        "text": "Hey all, long time lurker here.\n\nAfter only 4 months of driving, I learned alot of what you all go through.\n\nI deliver for a shop where 90% of the deliveries are for section 8 households.\n\nI'm a combat vet, and I've experienced moments that put me on edge more than I expected as a driver.\n\nI plan on leaving due to an opportunity I acquired today, but will still be delivering for a few more weeks.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to give my respect to you guys, and to maybe share some stories, tips, etc.\n\nI'll share one of my experiences to make this less boring than it already is:\n\nI was given a quad, and one of the deliveries was to a complex where I was always given a hard time. \n\n5 story apartment complex with no elevator, and the apartment listed on the address slip was a previous address that was notorious for slamming the door shut on my face after signing the credit slip, leaving everything blank.\n\nI left this address as last on my route, due to me being salty. \n\nNo tips is common, and I'm fine with it, but when also met with treating me as a stair climbing slave to feed them, it irked me a bit, hence why I left them last on my route.\n\nAfter pulling into the complex, there was a block party of residents and their children riding bikes, playing on the outside playground, barbeque grills, etc.\n\nThere had to be at least 30 people outside while looking for the hard to find building number.\n\nI got out, and started searching. \n\nA group by the stairwell leading to the address saw me.\n\n\"AYYY PIZZA MAN, THAT'S FOR ME!\"\n\n\"Oh, cool, what's your apartment number?\"\n\n\"Uhhhhhhh..... . ... 304\"\n\n\"Oh, you must've placed an order before this one, this is for a different apartment!\"\n\n\"....fuck you\"\n\nI hate it, others trying to take advantage of me when delivering, thinking I'm some idiot.\n\nI found the apartment, children asnwered. I respectfully asked for the card holder. Card holder is pissed, signs just a signature on the slip. I look at the slip before feeding them.\n\n\"Oh, I noticed you didn't fill out the tip line! If you don't want to tip me, I just need you to either put a zero, or a line through the tip line! It's policy!\"\n\n50/50 they look shaken up and give me 5+ dollars, or they smile and put a fat line through it regardless how many traffic violations I broke to get them their food hot.\n\nI have had deliveries where I had to walk through complexes with lights flickering, almost like a horror movie set up.\n\nI've had deliveries where the homeowners opens the door, and starts cussing at me for being 10 minutes late. The second a customer curses at me, I about face and walk away. They start apologizing, but the disrespect has already occurred. I have had someone threaten to \"fuck me up\" because they didn't get their second pizza free after complaining about long delivery times, and record me walking to my car, refusing to give them their food.\n\nLuckily, my managers know the area, and allow the drivers to make the decision to not deliver the food based on customer attitude. They have always backed me up, and told the customer to call another chain if they want.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nI have been in combat in Afghanistan, and I can relate to delivery drivers at night. I see why this job is dangerous in certain areas, and I commend you guys!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/89etah/that_time_i_ordered_pizza_delivery_during_a/",
        "text": "During our third nor’easter last month I was at work with no sign from the higher ups that they would close early. It was snowing but not that bad so that was reasonable at the time. I also thought it was reasonable to order pizza delivery if there was a place that was still doing deliveries.\n\nI went on a national chain website where they have a status bar so you can watch the progress of your order. Most of the local places were not delivering but there was one a few towns over and the website said they could deliver to my work, even though that seemed far, so I placed the order. They also happened to be the place that’s a few blocks from my house.\n\nAn out later the weather had turned really nasty and my office was suddenly closing *immediately*. I could see the pizza was out for delivery so I called the place, spoke to the manager, and explained the situation to prevent the driver from showing up when no was here. He asked where it was being delivered to and I gave him the address. He said they didn’t have the order and don’t deliver this far anyway. \n\nThat was strange, because I could see the order was definitely with them and why would the website let me place an order with them if they don’t deliver to this area?\n\nAfter I hung up I looked into it further and realized I had made a big mistake in placing the order: I had entered the city I work in but put my home house number and street.\n\nBut now I’m being escorted out of the office so I can’t call back right away. Then my coworker’s car gets stuck and I have to help shovel out him because the snow is piling up up by the second and every minute more makes it less and less likely his car is going to be able to make it home even if we can get him out of the parking lot.\n\nSo it’s basically 45 minutes later before I call the manager back from the road and explain my mistake. I ask him to let the driver know to skip my delivery and I’ll just pick it up from their store on my way home. He doesn’t seem confident in his ability to reach the driver, which I find strange, but there’s nothing else I can do at this point. \n\nNo sooner do I hang up with him than I watch a giant tree fall right in front of the car ahead of me. I have a tiny little compact car. Any hope I had that this car was going to get me home just went right out the window. I park my car and call my boss, who has an SUV, and ask for a ride home.\n\nAt this point I realize I’m never going to get there to get this pizza - I certainly wasn’t going to ask my boss to stop for pizza on the way home! The pizza was already paid for, so I wasn’t worried about stiffing them, but I had intended to also leave I big tip for the delivery guy who had braved the snow. But I figured I’d just stop in the next day with the tip since I knew who it was from the website.\n\nSo I’m in the car waiting for my boss for about half an hour when my phone rings. It’s an unlisted number and turns out to be the delivery guy who is on my doorstep all these hours later trying to deliver this pizza and I am far from home. \n\nI’m mortified as I had really tried so hard to prevent this. I try to explain everything but he just knows I ordered a pizza during a nor’easter and aren’t even home to tip him. Who does that? He’s really angry, doesn’t really listen to me, and says he’s going back to cancel the order.\n\nI feel terrible. It all went so very wrong. I’m a little upset that the manager couldn’t just text him and cancel the delivery and a little upset that the driver was so rude to me when I tried to explain it was a mistake and I had tried to fix it. But, also, I get it. Manager was overwhelmed. Driver just spent two hours driving through hell only to find some ahole wouldn’t answer the door and he probably thought I was actually home and just didn’t want to tip him.\n\nHe never canceled the order, so I paid for a pizza I didn’t eat, but I deserve that. They haven’t said I’m banned but I won’t be ordering delivery again because I know *I* wouldnt want to deliver to me ever again!\n\nOn I side note we had a fourth nor’easter the following week. I really wanted pizza again. I refrained from ordering. My office closed an hour later. I don’t know what it is with me and snow storms and pizza, but I’ve learned my lesson!\n\nEdit: Nor’easter is basically a blizzard. ",

        "text": "I would love to open a shop some day, where the drivers and servers, could rate the customer, much like they rate us. The outcome being, rewards for maintaining a certain rating for a period of time. Customers maintaining a 3/5 star rating or better, are rewarded with access to a variety of coupons or discounts. Customers below a certain threshold, could be restricted to carry out/dine in only, pre paying with credit cards on delivery etc. Things that would negatively affect someone's rating: 1. Not being home/passing out before the delivery gets there. 2. Treating employees disrespectfully. 3. Overtime a pattern of ordering late night without a light on. 4. Ordering with an unshoveled walk. Those sorts of things. It would require an honor system by the drivers/servers to reward the well mannered customers with a positive rating. Some of you might say, well couldn't the driver just rate bad tippers poorly till they couldn't order anymore? I've thought of that. You would have to attach a reason to the poor rating from a drop down menu, and bad tipping wouldn't be on there. As biased as I am being a delivery driver, we can't decline someone service because they won't tip. A bad tipper could still maintain that 3/5 star rating and earn coupons/discounts. But vice versa, tipping WELL might earn a customer that 4th or 5th/5 star, getting them access to BETTER coupons/discounts. Obviously there would be lots more planning to discuss, but I'm just dreamin' here. \n\nCurrently the place I work at has a three strike policy. If your order gets brought back to the store three times without any form of communication with the store, we will no longer deliver to ya. ",

It was 9 pm. \n\nNow, I order from them often, and I usually tip 8-10 dollars for orders from $25-$45.00.\n\nI called and complained. (After waiting on hold for 14 minutes) They did send a new pizza, and the meat. (Not second soda, sigh) \n\nMy questions: why did she lie? \n\nWhy did she carry the pizza sideways? \n\nWhy did she forget my soda a second time? \n\nI didn’t tip her the second time, but only because she lied. Was I wrong? I’m not feeling good, because I fell and hurt myself, and having to get up and down several times was agony. (Husband was pet-herding) \n\nCan you wonderful people help me make sense of this? \n\n\n\n\nEdit:  Thanks to everyone who responded. I am going to call and let a manager know that this is unacceptable. \n\nSafe driving, and may your customers be sweet, and your tips awesome! ",

I didn't have to get even a decent look to know it was fake so as she handed it to me I went \"oh my god...\", but a cursory look made it even worse. The pic might not do justice but the color was off af and the blue security strip thing was very clearly photocopied.\n\nWhen questioned she said the dude offered her a $50 at first and she said she didn't have change (bc she shouldn't have...), but then he changed his mind and got out a $100. I think she must have left out a part where she hesitated about the 50 and he could tell she was borderline retarded from the interaction so he tried to pass this bill off. She gave him $85 in change... OH and he wasn't caught bc the address provided wasn't his; apparently she just met him outside the building and trusted that he was legit!\n\ninb4 she wasn't trained enough. she was.",

A knife is honestly not an option because I'm not coordinated enough to actually use it properly, especially in the middle of a scary situation like getting robbed.

One of such businesses orders multiple times a day so I spend a lot of time there.  Over the past year or so I've developed a pretty good relationship with the secretary, we talk about banal shit like work, TV, or annoying family crap.  It's never been very serious or the least bit suggestive as I have a girlfriend and I've always assumed she has a boyfriend.\n\nCut to yesterday, when I delivered to her we chatted about nothing in particular, then while I was with the customer she wrote down something on a piece of paper and handed it to me, it was her phone number.  I feel like I should address that this has never happened to me before, I'm incredibly antisocial and rarely make conversation with people outside my family and coworkers, so I have no frame of reference to even pretend to draw experience from.\n\nSo,what do I do? How do I handle the situation in a way that doesn't make things terribly awkward every time I deliver there?  We know each other really well, she even knows the names of my little brothers and the classes I'm taking.  I have a feeling I won't be able to salvage the friendship but how do I handle this in the most respectful way possible?",

I'm talking to you on my cell phone!\n\n**Now it doesn't seem like much at all, but I was just baffled to have a grown man ask me, a pizza place employee, to explain to him the complexity of telecommunications and why his cell phone was having connection issues. **\n\nI told him the only thing I could think of and blame it on our phones sucking. Because, what am I to do? I wanted to tell him \"You don't get upset at your waiter when your power goes out, or at your mailman when your plumbing is awry! Why the fuck would you yell at me because your phone signal is garbage?!\"\n\nNow somehow, miraculously after this occurs his phone is fixed! I can hear him clear as day!

(No, it's not Game of Thrones.)  \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________  \n  \nI am Me, He is Him. Very imaginative, I know.  \n  \nThis one starts with Him ordering a pizza for delivery on the busiest night that I have been with the company, outdoing even Australia Day and Christmas Eve. Best bit is, we only had 3 people rostered on, only one of whom was actually in the shop the whole time - that being your's truly.  \nThen, He calls back to ask where his pizza is...  \n  \n*With exhaustion clearly audible in my voice, I have no doubt*  \nMe: Hello, [Company, Location], my name is Fitzynator42, how can I help you?  \nHim: Yeah, I wanna know where my damn pizza is!  \nMe: Could I get your name please?  \nHim: I ordered it half a fucking hour ago, Jesus...  \nMe: I just need to get your name, please.  \n*With the air of, to quote, 'conferring a favour on a lesser being'*  \nHim: Yeah, it's [Name].  \nMe: One moment, please.  \n*I check the dockets, no it's not hanging up there, which means it is on the road... somewhere...*  \nMe: Okay, well it's left the shop, so it could feasibly be arriving at any minute.  \nHim: Well how long is it gonna take dammit?  \nMe: We don't have that information, unfortunately. We are very short-staffed tonight, and our drivers have to be doing double or triple-deliveries in single runs, so I'm af-  \nHim: So how fucking long is it gonna take?!  \n*I now know that no matter what I say to this man, he is going to start yelling*  \nMe: It is impossible to tell exactly how long it will take, if I had to guess, then I would say it would not be any more than 20 minutes.  \n*That is me pulling a number out of thin air*  \nHim: So I've gotta wait another 20 fucking minutes for the pizza I ordered half a fucking hour ago, is that it?  \nMe: It may well be less than 20 minutes, as I said, it is impossible to tell. Also, half an hour ago, we were telling any delivery orders that they may have to wait for up to an hour, because we are very busy tonight.  \n*Completely changes attitude now, or so it seems*  \nHim: Well, I guess it's all just water under the bridge, hey? 'Keep calm and carry on', right?  \nMe: That is a very good way of looking at it, sir.  \nHim: Riiight...  \n*Back to grouchy 'I want to tear you limb-from-limb' voice*  \nHim: Get fucked, you dumb cunt.  \n*Now I am annoyed. I do not enjoy being cursed at. No one does. That is not a part of our job as pizza people, and we do not get paid enough to enjoy it.*\nMe: And the same to you.  \nAnd I hang up.  \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________  \n  \nSo yes, that was that. No idea when he got his pizza. Don't really care. Frankly, he can choke on it, for all I care...  \nPlease do tell me how much you dislike the person on the other end of the phone. We might be able to start a wholesome conversation based solely on the person on the other end of the phone and our mutual dislike of them...  \n  \nHave a good one, all you pizza-ists!",

Basically, I work an 8-5 and needing extra money to pay back debt. I was considering doing pizza delivery as the store down the road said now hiring drivers. But I been on this sub since last night reading story after story and boy, is there a lot of them! \nSo now I just have a few questions, some of these have been asked/answered in the past, but since I have multiple questions, I want to group them altogether and see if you guys can help with them since I am looking for more insight. Thanks!\n\n\n1) How does the shift work if you are scheduled for 6-10pm and there is still pizza to be delivered and say you get back to the store at 9:50pm and store closes at 10pm. Do you get paid for the 4 hours and deliver the pizza and go home? Or do you just get to clock out and go home? or do you deliver the pizza and go back to the store and get paid exact hours, like you get back at 10:47pm, so you get paid for 4Hr47minutes?\n\n1B) What are your typical night shift part time hours? And how about weekend?\n\n\n2) Is there a certain season or time of year, it is more busy then others? \n\n\n3) What would you say on average, after paying for gas, do you make per hour? About $10/hr? \n\n3A) On average, how much gas money do you put into the car per work shift- and how long is the shift?\n\n3b) Is tip money the only money you get to take home every shift or do some of you get paid your hourly wage and gas money/delivery money at the end of the shift?\n\n\n4) if the person pays credit card and tips on the phone, how do you recieve that tip money? Is it factored into the paycheck or cash given at the store? Do you  recieve 100% of that tip or do you have to share that tip with other people?\n\n\n5) Do you have to have different car insurance or can you just say you do and keep delivering pizza with your regular car insurance?\n\n\n6) Is Friday/Saturday nights usually the busiest? If not, what is?\n6a) what is the most you got to take home after working a regular shift? What is the least? \n\n\n7) what is the process of getting hired? Just go for an interview and start delivering pizza right away? Or is there a full background check, license check, drug test, training, etc? \n\n7A) Do you shadow someone else delivering first day? or do you go out by yourself?\n\n\n8) Do you have to have a smart phone with GPS? Or can you use a regular GPS to deliver pizza?\n\n\n9) On average, what mile radius do you deliver within?\n\n9a) What part of the US/World do you deliver in? (If state is too specific, can just give a broader answer, - EXample: New England, Southeast USA, Westcoast, etc)\n\n\n10) Do you get free food/drinks while working? \n\n\n11) How safe would you say delivery is? Have any of you encountered danger and/or got threatened or hurt while working?\n\n\n12) What are some other Pros/ CONS of delivering pizza not listed?\n\n\n\nI know everyone is different and answers will vary but I am just looking for an estimate of what I could be making and some personal info to see if this is the right job for me. Thank you anyone who has answered/replied. Appreciate the help!\n(Sorry if it is too many questions, I hope i didn't forget any, I am just trying to see if this is right for me)",

Nope. None of the adults know who ordered it so it’s not part of the temple. No name on the order so I nobody can tell me who ordered it. Call the guy and his phone is constantly cutting out so I can’t make heads or tails of anything he’s saying. Sounds drunk too. Another kid says his dad ordered it and the kids dad openly says he didn’t order it and he cops an attitude when I say I can’t give him the pizza if he didn’t order it. Finally at this point I say “you know what, I have another order to deliver still, to a customer I know will be where they say they’ll be” and I leave. Call the store as I pull out and tell them that this guy can pick up his pizza. Probably my most infuriating delivery yet. ",

(I love the current job, literally no complaints. Everything wrong with the first two jobs is completely gone.) But I've come to a point where I realize that I'm not content with my career and it's not something I want to do forever. to anyone that's been in a similar situation; what would be the best thing to look into as a sort of transitional job? Something I can get into that pays better than minimum wage and doesn't require a big time/money investment. Something to hold me over while I actually take up college for what I really want to do. I've considered things like getting a bartending or security license, but I'd like feedback.\n**TL;DR** What's a decent paying job I can get into *before* I get a degree that *won't* be destroying my car?",

I got a delivery to the sketchier side of this small town and drove over there as normal, got my stuff together, got out of the car, and saw this skinny redneck boy, probably like 20 or 21 years old, standing shirtless on the front porch.\n\nI tell him the total and he reaches INSIDE his pants and pulls out some 1$ bills which were literally hanging out of his waistband, and grabs a 20$ out of his back pocket. \n\n“How much of a tip do you want?” He asked in a very creepy voice, kinda made me uneasy.\n\nI’ve never really been asked that before so I was like “anything would be appreciated, man.”\n\nHe looks like he’s contemplating something, and then mutters “nah... no, no...” under his breath and hands me the total with a 2$ tip.\n\nHe takes his pizza and goes for the door, and as I’m walking down the front porch stairs I look back and see this guy snatch a camera off the door, which presumably was recording our entire interaction. \n\nI think he was just a gay country boy who wanted some head.

I don’t work there anymore and they should certainly be ashamed of themselves I feel. \n\nSo I was working there delivering pizza. I really enjoyed it, made good money. One day the car topper flies off my car. It took me a minute to realize, but once I did I did backtrack with no sign of the sign. Told the assistant manager when I got back.  On with the shift. \n\nLater on a police officer comes by with the destroyed sign (one magnet missing). He said someone ran over the sign and they want compensation. The cop DID NOT take my insurance info as it wasn’t my fault, it was the companies equipment. Left the manager a police report. \n\nI didn’t hear anything for about a month. The company then comes back saying they want my insurance info and to submit with them. I told them no. I’m very upset with the company at this point. About another month later, the manager says the DM is sending the police offer to the store the next day, with the dipshit that ran over the sign, to get my insurance info. Manager was giving me warning. This is where I find out that it’s not good for me to be delivering pizza without commercial insurance. WTF? Why is t this big ass corporation telling their employees this!? I tell him I quit. I’m not getting dropped by my insurance for this part time job. \n\nMonths later and no cop or dipshit ever come to track me down for my insurance. 🙄 anyways I had also called the companies safety officer during all this after I found out they wanted MY insurance. The guy was a total condescending douche bag about it saying *i* was the one driving. But I said it was your douche sign that failed which you required me to put on!  \n Anyways I’m sure you can deduce which company this is 😜 if you work there beware. The manager stopped asking employees to put on the toppers and I also heard of toppers failing all the time I’m just unlucky enough to have a dipshit run over it. But what if it crashes into someone after it came off?? ",

        "text": "Don’t work for a pizza delivery company, but a local company that delivers food from over 20 local restaurants. To the north of the county are two lakes, which is where this story is based out of. \n\nThese customers ordered 2 subs from a local sub place. The address was to a boat house, which is a place where people can put their boats into the water on the lake, aka they can pay to use the boat ramps. \n\nIn the “comments section” of their ticket, they said “Come to THIS boat house. We’re on a boat.”\n\nSo I got there, fairly early. The sub place was on top of their game today. I get there, and there are 6 boats in the water in front of the boat house. *What fucking boat are these people on?* \n\nI call them and they said they’re not at the boat house. They said they are out on the water and will start heading towards the boat house. They call me when they are close and I see the woman I’m on the phone with on a pontoon boat frantically waving at me. \n\nI walk towards the dock they are... driving? Floating? Boating up to? Whatever term you want to use...\n\nI got to the dock, and walked to the end of it, and hand off the food to my customer before the boat even came to a stop. I said “Dock side delivery, how about that?” or something along those lines. Everyone laughed and the driver of the boat kicked it in reverse, and off they went back to the lake.\n\nHas anyone else ever delivered food... to a boat before?\n",

I get the notification that the pizza is on it's way, and so I go wait by the front door. I grab my wallet the get the money when my heart sinks...I have nothing smaller than a $100. I had just cashed my paycheck yesterday and forgot the cashier gave me all big bills. \n\nI didn't want to make the guy wait while I went to the store and tried to make change, or worse, make him come all the way back from his store to bring break my 100. So, I just let him keep it.\n\nA nearly 350% tip. I really hope this pizza is good. ",

        "text": "So at the start of the month I was officially promoted to a Shift Leader, essentially junior management. Honestly, when I started six months ago I just wanted to drive. Shoot on bad weeks I was making at least what was making at Kum &amp; Go now working ten hours less a week, so it wasn’t bad.\n\nFrankly I wasn’t really building up for any promotion, since I saw my money might slip away. Go ahead and call me a greedy Jewish bastard. (I mean no disrespect to any Jewish people out there. My assistant manager who is Jewish calls me this.😶) I got convinced to go through the process to become a Shift Leader because the two we had were about to both be out for 2 weeks at the same time for Spring Break and surgery, respectively.\n\nSo I thought, why not. My general and assistant managers shouldn’t have to essentially work 2 weeks straight because no one else is there to run the store. So I figured with 6 years retail experience I could help out. Plus, the fact I was told I would more than likely be driving once the other 2 came back, but still retain my Shift Leader position and be more or less a backup. Which I am 100% fine with.\n\nProblem is I’m being told I’m doing better than one of the other Shift Leaders, and I’m worried just maybe this will damn me in taking me off the road for good.\n\nSo far this month I’ve taken 1 delivery, and that’s only because I’ve had to fight for it tonight. I recognized the name as someone I used to wait on at Kum &amp; Go who I thought was cute. I crushed on her and gave her the level of service I technically should’ve given to everyone, I did the same for her husband, hell I knew I wouldn’t have ever had a chance with her and they were one of the few customers that were actually nice.\n\nSo the delivery’s ready, but my 3 drivers I have are halfway decent to horribly slow and my manager thinks the husband’s mad when she calls him because we’re out of the dough for one of his pizzas. Since I saw the name, I was thinking I can’t have these people waiting 45 mins to an hour.\n\nI somewhat beg, my GM to let me switch it to carry out and take it myself. Initially she’s reluctant since it’s just the two of us really in the store, but she does eventually relent because I am the second fastest driver in the store. At the time, I wasn’t really thinking about a tip. Just the fact people I liked weren’t going to have to wait that long. I know I shouldn’t play favorites, but hey if you know someone at a place of business odds are they’re going to take better care of you. We’re only human.\n\nSo I manage to make myself $10, and I even tried to split it with my manager since that was her price. Turns out she was just joking with me on that, when I tried to give her the 5. So it would seem like I have the best of both worlds, but I know it isn’t.\n\nSo somewhat getting back on topic, have any of my fellow former drivers had this issue themselves? Basically being promoted and how often you’ve gotten to drive afterward. Or have I just had the wool pulled over my eyes?",

        "text": "So I haven't posted here in a while, so hi.\n\nLittle update, I went through the worst 3 months of my life when my GM quit and a bunch of people just started either quitting or becoming super unreliable, we got a new GM, hired like 10 new people, a bunch of old people quit because \"grr aaa GM isn't letting us chat in between every single delivery\", and now life is good because we're adequately staffed and our drivers generally don't suck (inexperienced, but good at their job in its core).\n\nThis doesn't mean that the shitshow stops though.\n\nSo in our area we have an apartment complex called something to the extent of \"The 1920 Main Street Apartments\"\n\nThis is generally a very nice thing. We have an address, we have a description of the place, and we know exactly where it is... except this place decides to fuck with us.\n\nSo the 1920 Main Street apartments has 4... buildings?? I guess you could say 4 areas, since they are physically multiple buildings each. Unlike most apartment complexes that will use one address and label the buildings with numbers, this place decides to use 4 different addresses.\n\nSo we have 1920, 1910, 1900, and 1820.\n\nIt's a fucking mess because all of these places have the exact same numbering system, EXCEPT for the 1920 building. So it makes it extra frustrating because we know an apartment isn't in the 1920 building, but we can't do anything since the person is so stubborn because \"oh the sign says\"\n\nThere are unofficial building numbers, but only some rooms will have that, which makes it even MORE confusing because then we'll assume it's something completely different. It's on the mailboxes, which leads me to believe that people KNOW it exists, but just choose to not tell us when they order.\n\nWith that backstory out of the way, I end up taking a phone order at about 10:30 at night.\n\nDude is D me is Me\n\nD: \"Yeah I live at the 1920 main street apartments\"\n\nM: \"cool can i get your apartment\"\n\nD: \"110\"\n\nM: \"Oh which building are you in\"\n\nD: \"1920 main street apartments\"\n\nM: \"I know but like which building, 1-4?\"\n\nD: \"Dude you're really going to have to calm to fuck down\"\n\nM: *knowing that hanging up now will cause the rest of my night to get really annoying* \"can do, what can I get you\"\n\nD: \"whazza cheapest pizzah you got\"\n\nMe: *Proceeds to be a great employee and tells him about all of the fantastic deals you can get at your local pizzeria*\n\nD: *Gets that and gets wings and a soda as people like this often do*\n\nSo the order is in, we're having a fantastic time, the usual \"FUCK\" from the cook comes out, as what usually happens when orders come in this late, and I prepare for the inevitable shitshow.\n\nSo I know his apartment isn't in the first building, which means that I start off at the second building. Drive up, knock on the door\"\n\n\"pizza\" \"no\"\n\nSomething I forgot to mention is that all of these buildings have really separated parking lots (except the 1st and the 2nd for some reason). Separated meaning there is a giant fucking hill that separates them. So going to each parking lot means turning around (in the very tight space that I have), getting back on the road, dealing with the tiny space of a 1 lane road, and repeating the process 3 times.\n\nSo I proceed on foot.\n\nAnd I think I find it. 3 dudes hanging out at an apartment, smoking only what can be the dankest of kushes.\n\nIt's the apartment next to them.\n\n\"Yeah dude there's like different buildings so they're probably at a different building\"\n\nI really only have 1 choice, and it leads me to 2 things.\n\nA) A really fucking annoying phone call where the person will claim that i put the address in wrong and where the fuck is my food and jesus did not die for my pizza to be lukewarm\n\nB) The next building will be him.\n\nSo I knock.\n\nAnd as these things go, it takes about 20 years for these guys to come out, but they're like \"I'm comin out dude!!!!!\" like lmao just open the door lmao you knew this was going to happen.\n\nSo the door opens and I am introduced to the dankest of smelling apartments, with a grand total of 1 piece of furniture.\n\nM: \"Hey there :)) I'm here with your order!! We got a large pizza, so-\"\n\nD: \"Nigga quiet DOWN!!!!\"\n\nM: *Quiets down as a nigga should\" \"so yeah we got the things, total is gonna be $34.70\"\n\nD: \"Okay, come inside man\"\n\nM: *places my foot inside and stares*\n\nAt this point I sort of figured that it wouldn't be too out of these question for these guys to try to grab the food and go, so I just hold onto the bag until I get payment.\n\nM: \"It's gonna be $34.70\"\n\nD: \"Dude come inside\"\n\nM: \"No can do man, company policy\"\n\nD: \"Come on man\" *pulls out $20 and waves it in the general proximity of my face* \"We got the payment for you\"\n\nM: \"Dude I already told you this is as far as I'm going. Now you gotta pay man.\"\n\nD: \"Come on, I'm not gonna kill you or anything.\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure what face I made at this point because I had fallen into my state of \"why the fuck do I do this job\", a state that I have entered in many times over my 14 months of delivering.\n\nAfter some back and forth they finally give me the money and look all pissy and suck.\n\nNo tip, of course, but from the second they called I just sort of assumed that was going to happen.\n\nI don't know if this was an attempt to rob me or if this group of upstanding gentlemen living in an apartment with a total of 1 couch just really wanted me to hop on in and be their buddy, but I can say that it was definitely one of the weirdest and most annoying of my deliveries.\n\nThe craziest thing about this is that about a week later, I get a midday delivery to the same place... and it's a completely different person. Instead of 3 dudes, it's a mom who's generally very friendly but also stiffed. Same furniture though (There wasn't that much to keep track of).\n\nAt the very least I have a story to tell people why they shouldn't go into people's houses.",
