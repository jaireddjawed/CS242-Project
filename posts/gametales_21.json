        "text": "&gt;Be DM\n\n&gt;Have a really awesome player, who has like 5 pages of backstory.\n\n&gt;Useful to use that backstory as backup plot hooks if you need them.\n\n&gt;Use backup plot hooks more often than regular plot hooks.\n\n&gt;Player is a bastard son of a noble. Said noble sells mercenary services. Knows how to fight. Is kind of power hungry.\n\n&gt;Player grows up learning how to fight. His name is Vernaux, and he looks like this http://imgur.com/a/aKUmO.\n\n&gt;Anyways he also has a girlfriend who is of a rival house. \n\n&gt;Can't tell anyone, especially his father.\n\n&gt;Romeo and Juliet basically.\n\n&gt;Anyways said girl and him fall in love. However some bandits stab her with a knife that has some ancient disease on it. She's going to die in a year.\n\n&gt;He decides to go on quests to save her life. Finds a group of misfits that are otherwise known as the Dnd party.\n\n&gt;Adventures with them until they learn about a group of people who want to bring down the city.\n\n&gt;Viva la revolution!\n\n&gt;Party tries to stop them but fails. City collapses from chaos, and party flees north.\n\n&gt;They think city fell into Rebel's hands but Lord Gardway (Vernaux's dad) was able to take control. It's kind of a military dictatorship now.\n\n&gt;While up north they do some adventuring and come across some magic gear. Vernaux gets a dancing sword that activates on the command word *Aegis*.\n\n&gt;They stay up here for a while until they discover that the source of the sickness is actually from Lord Gardway. He poisoned her as part of a political act. He's also the only one who knows the cure, because he made the plague. \n\n&gt;His girfriend's condition has worsened. Will probably die in less than a month.\n\n&gt;Also hear about the dictatorship. \n\n&gt;It's time to build an army!\n\n&gt;They build an army and travel south. Are able to tame purple worms along the way. (Don't ask me how).\n\n&gt;They make it to the city which is on top of a mesa. Their army is big but is minuscule compared to Gardway's army. Except we have purple worms. Flying purple worms. (Fly spell).\n\n&gt;Carve a path to the central palace. Make it there but get surrounded by the bigger army. Big monsters fighting each other. Purple worms tearing everything up. General chaos.\n\n&gt;Vernaux see's his opportunity and sneaks into the palace. Finds the throne room and kicks down the door.\n\n&gt;His father is there prepared for battle. Turns to see his son just came into the room, with his swords drawn.\n\n&gt;Gardway pauses for a second, but then says \"How great it is to see you again Vernaux. I trust that you have been well? It has been quite a while since we last saw each other.\"\n\n&gt;Vernaux interrupts saying \"Tell me the cure to the plague.\"\n\n&gt;Gardway stops, looking surprised. \"How do you know about the plague?\" Vernaux is silent and won't give any answer. \n\n&gt;Gardway then continued \"Why would you care about the cure? Unless someone you care about is in danger? Is that the case Vernaux?\" No reply from Vernaux again. \n\n&gt;\"You come here with an army, try to burn my city, and then demand that I give you the cure! That's quite a bold statement considering that your army is surrounded. But, you are my son. You are also a skilled general to have gotten this far. I will give it to you if you do one thing for me. Call off your army, and join me. Then I will give you the cure.\"\n\n&gt;Vernaux hesitated. He could finally save Requia. He then slowly put his swords back in their sheathes.\n\n&gt;\"I expected nothing less of you.\" Gardway said with a smile as he came up to Vernaux. \"Come. Let us go to the balcony. You can call off the army there.\"\n\n&gt;As they approached the balcony Vernaux got a good look of the surrounding area. He saw his army in the center of it all fighting to free the city from the dictatorship. Fighting to get him the cure. Fighting for him. The few people he could call friends were down there fighting for him. They were surrounded and outnumbered but they were doing what they believed was right.\n\n&gt;\"Go on, call them off.\" Gardway said while overlooking the battlefield. \"The sooner you do this, the sooner you can save them\".\n\n&gt;Vernaux looked over the battlefield. He knew what he had to do. He then softly said one word. \"*Aegis*.\"\n\n&gt;\"What did you say?\" Gardway asked. At that moment a dancing sword came up from behind him and attacked him. He heard the blade coming just in time for him to dodge it.\n\n&gt;He then turned to Vernaux, drawing his sword. \"Bastard!\" he spat. He then advanced towards Vernaux.\n\n&gt;Vernaux drew his swords and dashed forward to meet his father in combat. They fought on the balcony trading blow after blow, while the army fought below.\n\n&gt;Gardway's Vorpal sword hummed with delight as it swung towards it's next target. Vernaux was barely able to leap out of the way, trying to keep distance between it, and his neck. The sword cut through the balcony railing leaving a big gap behind Vernaux. \n\n&gt;They continued to fight until they heard a loud cracking sound all throughout the mesa. The mesa was beginning to crumble from the weight of the armies and the monsters. The ground shifted beneath them and Vernaux fell through the gap in the balcony.\n\n&gt;Vernaux plummeted through the air, and was barely able to roll into his fall, his dancing sword hitting the ground next to him. Gardway used his sword to descend from the balcony, stabbing it into the wall to break his fall. The magic of the sword cut through the wall with ease. Vernaux scrambled to get his swords and the fight resumed.\n\n&gt;Gardway swung again this time cleaving one of Vernaux's swords. Left with one sword, and the dancing sword he held the one with 2 hands and challenged his father again. They continued to fight with the mesa shifting beneath them constantly. Rock sprayed up into the air from the energy of the collapsing mesa.\n\n&gt;Vernaux's other sword was soon knocked from his hands, and he fell to the ground. His father stood over him. \"I should have killed you years ago. You were always the worst child.\" He rose the blade up to attack Vernaux. A huge chasm began opening up behind Gardway.\n\n&gt;Vernaux quickly called his dancing sword to him and commanded it to parry the blow. His sword flew across the ground and raised itself just in time to block the hit. The sudden parry threw him off balance and Vernaux took the opportunity to kick him into the abyss. He fell down, and was torn up by the mesa. Vernaux and his piece of the mesa plummeted down to the ground. It impacted on the ground, and all was black.\n\n&gt;Vernaux soon woke up on the ground with destroyed rubble all around him. He looked up to see his fellow party member. The dwarf cleric explained that he had broken his fall with one of his spells. Vernaux stood up and surveyed the battlefield. The mesa was completely destroyed. Of the bodies that were left, not many of them were moving. The dwarf continued to go around healing many of his allies. \n\n&gt;Vernaux looked around for the remains of the palace. He found black chunks of it that one could assume was the palace. He dug through it finding nothing in there that could help him. Until he saw the red blade of his fathers vorpal sword.\n\n&gt;He investigated the rubble there and found his father's dead body. On it he was able to find a metal vial that contained a sweet smelling substance. The dwarf identified it as a cure. \n\n&gt;Vernaux teleported to where his girlfriend was and gave her the cure. After she recovered they decided that his life of adventuring was over. They found a secluded place to live, and began raising a family.\n\n&gt;And that is the story of Vernaux Gardway.",

Whew, man, it's tough to be a storyteller sometimes. \n\nFirst, I'm blessed to have such amazing players. This first story arc was mainly to get the three new players used to VtM and grow into their characters, and boy did they. I thought this first arc would only be a session or two and it became 6. I am pretty happy with the results.\nSo here it is, the players are slapped with reality and even more mystery. Hope you enjoy.

The druid summons a greater earth elemental and has it dig a pit as wide and deep as it can get. I grab the druid and our book fly us up to the point of where it becomes very difficult to breathe and use the book to summon another massive earth elemental. The fighter has magical wings and manages with a great roll to set the titan's hair on fire causing it to panic and run towards a lake where we made the massive hole. It trips, my druid shots \"METEOR!!!\" uses the book to summon another giant elemental rolls a nat 20 for accuracy and we crush it's skull with a 40,000 kg. piece of sentient rock and earth falling from 1,500 m.",

A chaotic party with people new to Pathfinder can be difficult to work with.\nThe party was, at level 5 each,\n\n(Me) Lex, the Kitsune gunslinger with a penchant for vigilantism via kneecapping.\n\nTatiana, the human ranger archer whose very first action in the game was a nat 1 that broke her bow.\n\nLelouche, the CE ranger swordsman that hates gnomes and all of us. \n\n...the gnome, Stringendo the bard, who is on a mission to save the gnomish people from persecution and being fashioned into lawn ornaments.\n\nMunva, the Orc druid, who has less WIS than me, and whose companion War Bull is smarter than her.\n\nAnd Boffadeez, name referencing exactly what you think, the Dhampyr Inquisitor of Cayden Cailean.\n\nIt was the motliest crew you could get. All gathered for one reason or another to join a guild of adventurers, set to stop any and all encroaching darkness.\nWe're pretty bad at that.\n\nAnywho, after passing initiation and getting teleported to a dwarven city as our HQ, our CE friend wanders off into the city, not feeling like listening to us bicker, looking for a place to sleep. Never mind that we get free housing as members of our guild, but she didn't know upon leaving, and she wasn't about to metagame. \n\nSo she needs money, and of course the most obvious idea is to go mug people for it and finds a husband, wife and daughter combo in an alley and attempts to mug them. They were monks. At this point my crime hating gunslinger senses crime occur, and I bolt out of HQ in pursuit of it. I come across the scene, and realize that my teammate is trying to mug people. So I do what my character would do. I call a shot to their knee to subdue them.\n\nI crit. I confirm.\nThis would've simply hurt...had I not been wielding a musket, with a x4 multiplier. I had 4d12 +28 damage, and Lelouche went down, no chance of survival. We immediately scatter in fear of guards and I expected that to be the end of it.\n\nOur DM was feeling slightly (SLIGHTLY) merciful and brought him back...after making a deal with Mephistopheles. So I had an angry CE dude breathing down my neck, with an oath of vengeance on me. We managed to deal with this safely while in Willy Wonka's magic gnome tower...that's another story.\n\nThe second time, the victim was less lucky.\n\nAfter we finished the Willy Wonka mission, and sent all the gnomes to the dwarf city, Lelouche and the Orc, Munva, were arrested for gnomish hate crimes, a la throwing them around like footballs.\n\nAfter some shenanigans that held up the game, Munva tried breaking out of prison with her War Bull, while the guards try to stop. Me and Tatiana were off drinking our headaches away and came to mock them, like the good friends we are. After a Nat 1 Initiative roll, and bearing witness to a highly illegal prison escape, I drunkenly fumble with my gun, mumble something about making it two for two, bring it to bear and aim for Munva, as I was getting a little sick of \nthe holdup.\n\nI crit again.\n\nMunva did not make it either, and she ain't so lucky to make a deal to come back.\n\nThis makes a grand total of 3 party members I've killed, as I killed one of Lelouche's player's characters in another game.\nWe ended there.\nTatiana now fears getting in a fight with me and we're getting a new teammate next game.

        "text": "**The PCs:**\n\n  - Wrath, half-giant warrior, not very bright, but hits like a monster with his large scythe\n\n  - Dukash, catfolk light fighter, military strategist, and an \"ends justify the means\" type\n\n  - Corbenik, warforged samuri, cold, effecient, loves slicing open meatbags\n\n  - Nodrog, doppleganger healer, annoying asshole, but hey, a healer's a healer\n\n  - Daerion, pixie rogue, prone to being a pyromaniac, goes insane at the full moon\n\n  - Veskar, human warlock, morally corrupt bastard, hears voices in his head\n\n**The Story:**\n\nAfter a long boat ride across the Sea of Falling Stars, we arrived at the Shining Plains to assist a friendly group of giants in their war against the Dwarves of the Orsraun Mountains. We trekked across the plains, dodging scouting parties here and there, before we came to a long bridge crossing the Wet River leading south to the town of Assam. Across the bridge, camped by the river, was a number of dwarves, but they were too far away to get an accurate count.\n\nOur half-giant, on edge and irritated by all the skulking and hiding, decided to draw his massive scythe and charge the camp at full speed, bellowing at the top of his lungs. Our catfolk warrior, pixie rogue, doppelganger healer, and warforged samurai quickly followed after him while I, the morally corrupt and ruthless warlock, set up to bombard the dwarves at range with my eldritch magics.\n\nAs the charging group drew closer, they were able to get a better estimate of the number we faced. Twenty two armored, battle trained dwarves, each a skilled warrior and flourishing double short swords, quickly formed up their ranks and braced themselves for the charge. Our half giant barreled into their leader, but, with the aid of his dwarven brothers, they absorbed the charge, rebuking the 8' tall warrior. The rest of the party caught up and quickly formed up, the catfolk nimbly lunging and parrying with his rapier, the healer twirling his quarterstaff, the warforged expertly slicing open foes with his daishō, and the half giant, locked in an epic battle with the dwarf leader.\n\nThey were quickly surrounded, fighting back to back against the dwarves on this massive bridge. Then, the pixie and I went to work. The pixie, with his bow, and I, with my baleful magic, tore into the enemy ranks, dropping some dwarves before they could raise a sword against our companions. Whether as pincushions or as burning husks, they fell, one by one, to our barrage.\n\nRound after round, our party fought valiantly, killing more than our party's worth of dwarves, but the strength of our warriors could not hold indefinitely. Our healer worked his magic, giving them a second wind, but the dwarven horde was still thick around them. Seeing the dire situation, our pixie surprised us. Putting away his bow and putting on a pair of magical gloves, he recited a brief incantation and held his hands out towards the enemy. Torrents of fire billowed from the gloves, the smell of burning hair and flesh filled the noses of our front line and the screams of those in the flames echoed across the bridge.\n\nMany dwarves fell to his flames before the gloves were spent and the battle began to tip in our favor. Blast after blast, I hammered away at the dwarven ranks, punching holes through their armor and flesh alike. Our warriors continued to fight, the catfolk amassing a pile of bodies before him with nary a scratch on him. The warforged had an equally sizable body count, but he was beginning wear down as the many cuts from the dwarven blades took their toll. Nearly spent magically, our healer continued to attack his foes with his simple quarterstaff, taking one or two down with incredibly lucky blows. And finally, our half-giant continued his battle against the dwarven leader, both equally matched in skill, strength, and determination.\n\nAs the river began to turn red with blood, tragedy struck. In an incredible flurry of blows, the dwarven leader deftly disarmed the half-giant and drove his short sword up, piercing our friend's jaw from below and firmly lodging the blade deep within his skull. Before his lifeless body could even hit the ground, I fired a bolt of energy at his killer, its amber light arcing like lightning toward its target, hitting him square in the chest, destroying his armor and blowing a gaping hole through his torso. The dwarf collapsed on top of his fallen foe, dead.\n\nSeeing their leader killed, the remaining handful of dwarves began to break ranks and flee towards the town, Assam, but our catfolk and pixie quickly finished them off. And so, exhausted, wounded, and with one friend lost to the void, the battle was won.",

        "text": "This is story that happened long ago, in a galaxy far, far from anything Star Wars related.\n\nMe and a group of internet buddies on Roll20 developed a fear every time we played a 4e Roleplaying session (yeah, those actually exist on 4e) because one guy couldn't make it, as I'll elaborate:\n\nIn this setting I was playing a Thri-Kreen, and the setting is a high fantasy with the element of intolerance as a main  theme (there was but one religion and everyone who worshipped another god was considered a heretic and was killed). The same setting also handled undead with extreme prejudice.\n\nDuring one of our quests we were being followed by someone - one thing led to another and the guy is dead, leaving behind an impressive medallion that we kept with us as we figured it belonged to some underground cult.\n\nBefore we left back to town from said quest, there was supposed to be a small roleplaying session as our DM wasn't really prepared for the next combat. Little did we know, we were heading into a royal guard checkpoint, and one of our players was a Revenant. That 'small rp session' turned to full combat soon after and we lost our tiefling.\n\nSo we arrived in town, and me and the group's rogue were going to one of the temples to figure out some clue left to us regarding an ongoing mystery about this land's past when we were ambushed, two tranuilizer darts later and we pass out.\n\nI find myself locked in a cell and a Paladin steps forward, carrying the same amulet the guy who came after us was carrying. Apparently they're like the Royal Templar CIA. \n\n**Oh. Shit.**\n\n\"Did you kill our informer?\" She asks.\nMe: \"Nope.\" Strike one. Bluff fails. She smites 1/4 of my \nHP.\n\nShe:\"You will tell us what happened andvwho did this\"\n\nMe: \"Never!\" \n\nStrike two. Bluff fails. She smites me for 1/2 my HP.\n\nShe:\"I won't say it again, who did this.\"\n\nMe:\"Okay, okay I'll talk...\"\n\nAt this moment I had to put the blame on anyone. Just about anybody, and I had to think fast.\n\nMe: \"It was... the tiefling. You'll find he also resisted arrest and got killed. We buried him next to the apple farm.\"\n\nDM: She... **believes you.**\n\nAnd so she freed both me and my friend with a warning and we managed to survive. We developed a fear towards RPing and had a great time. Love ya Vadram.",

        "text": "Hello again! Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy. \n\nThis is a continuation of the previous tale '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 7', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4sm4zf/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, our courageous miscreants managed to strike at the heart of the Zel'tan invasion of New York. Having infiltrated the alien prison ship, the villains slaughtered the crew and freed the captured humans on-board. During this time, Minato discovered that the Zel'tan were susceptible to his mind-control abilities and promptly abused the hell out of it. Once they returned home, Kitsune confronted Sarge about his suspicions and ordered a ghost to possess the mercenary. Here he discovered that Pinnacle was behind the entire thing and that this was a mock invasion, meant to provide Pinnacle himself with a way to establish himself as Earth's greatest hero. The psychic backlash of learning this left Minato on his knees and Sarge with a weapon pointed at his head. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\nKitsune peered up the gun barrel at his executioner, eyes narrowed. Sarge stared back with an unflinching stare, the weapon steady in his hand. Their silent battle of will continued for a few moments, with the mercenary allowing himself the slightest amount of satisfaction from having bested his quarry, until Kitsune smiled. As stoic as he was, Sarge could not repress the shiver of fear at the entirely unpleasant grin. His free hand reached for the communicator, activating the device in a burst of static.\n\n\"All units. Omega protocol activated. Target the wolf first.\" Minato's smugness faded at the order: He may not understand military commands but he was smart enough to know what Sarge had just commanded. Only after Kitsune's confident mien had slipped away did his captor allow himself to relax. As it turned out, this was a mistake. Minato reared back in disgust as a sheen of arterial spray misted over him, coating him the con-man in a thin layer of blood. Sarge desperately tried to staunch the life-blood pouring from his throat but a firm grip from behind held him in place. The military commander struggled desperately against his captor to not effect. The last thing that Sarge heard was a low voice in his ear.\n\n\"Go to sleep, sir. Your fight is over.\" Pilot spoke as a parent to a child, a low tone of reassurance. He held Sarge until he was completely still. Only once the mercenary had drawn his final breath did Pilot gently lower his corpse to the ground. Wiping his bloody blade across hardened armour, the soldier turned to Kitsune with a tired smile. \"So...this is a thing.\" Minato groaned as he was pulled back to his feet, his body screaming in pain at the exertion. He gave Pilot a side-long look, brushing dirt off of his suit with a grimace.\n\n\"You're not wrong. The question now becomes why the hell are you helping me? I thought you were one of Pinnacle's mercenaries.\" Pilot scoffed, sheathing his knife. \n\n\"I might be a mercenary but my contract absolutely did not cover participating in a fake alien invasion for some cockamamie get-rich scheme. It certainly didn't cover killing superheroes.\" He efficiently stripped his deceased superior, claiming his spare ammunition before handing Minato a loaded weapon. \"We need to move quickly if we're going to stop the squad from killing your friends.\" He removed the communicator from his ear and dropped it, crushing the device beneath his boot. \"So, what's the plan?\" Minato chuckled as he held the gun in a painful imitation of proper shooting stance.\n\n\"Stop a team of highly trained mercenaries from killing some super-villains, regroup with the others and save the world.\" Pilot nodded, replacing his helmet in one smooth motion. \n\n\"Good plan. Let's do this.\" The duo took a moment to ready themselves, or Minato did at the very least, before slipping in one of the many entrances to the museum. They moved with purpose, eschewing stealth for speed, as they crossed the hall and moved up the stairwell. Further into the building, Event Horizon practised one of his routines to a fast-paced soundtrack. The speedster shimmied, spun and danced to the beat of the music; his graceful form leaping through the air with aplomb. So entranced with his lithe cavorting was Event Horizon that he failed to notice a trio of mercenaries slip inside the room, quietly carrying a device with them. They silently went about their task, setting the machine on the ground and activating it. It was as the song came to an end that Event Horizon, winding down from the performance, finally noticed them.\n\n\"What the hell, guys? I specifically said no-one was meant to come in here when the music's going!\" His indignation was cut-short by an echoing roar of such intensity that it shook the museum walls. \"What the fuck is wrong with Barghast?\" Event Horizon rolled his eyes in irritation before towelling the sweat off of his body with a cloth, dropping the dirty rag on the floor. He reached for his staff at the same time that there was a high-pitched whine, drawing his attention. The mercenary's machine projected a bright yellow beam of light towards him, coalescing into a pulsating sphere of energy around Event Horizon. The amateur dancer pounded on the orb angrily, flinching back as it began to shrink in on him. \"What the fuck are you doing? Let me out of this thing, you little bastards!\" The mercenaries nodded to each other and separated, two of them leaving the room while the last stayed with the machine. The sole trooper remaining gave Event Horizon a consolatory shrug.\n\n\"Orders are orders. Sorry, buddy.\" She watched in vague amusement as the speedster rained blow after blow into the scintillating prison only for it to continue diminishing in size. \"It's a kinetic barrier. The harder you hit it, the quicker it shrinks.\" There was a note of smugness in her voice as she tapped the machine affectionately. \"We knew conventional weaponry wouldn't be able to stop you so we borrowed this bad-boy, just for you.\" Event Horizon retreated to the centre of the orb, kneeling down to avoid touching the energy cage. \n\n\"Yeah, I feel really fucking privileged in your goddamn death circle!\" He spat the words with as much venom as he could muster, trying to stave off the panic gripping his heart. The speedster curled into a ball, resting his hands on the wooden panelling for support. He fixed the female trooper with a look so dark that it could have had it's own fashion line at Hot-Topic. \"When I get out of here, I'm going to pound you into next week...And not in the fun way!\" She gave him a jaunty wave in return, leafing idly through a pamphlet on Iroquois culture. Event Horizon pounded the floor in frustration before stopping. He pressed gently at the wooden panels before grinning in violent glee. The trooper was distracted from her reading by the sound of wood splintering, looking up just in time for Event Horizon to vanish from sight. She rushed to the orb just as it blinked out of existence, stopping just shy of the newly added hole in the floor. The soldier of fortune barely had time to curse before Event Horizon exploded through the door and pummelled her into something loosely resembling pulp. \n \n\"Oh...I guess we don't have to rescue you.\" Event Horizon spun towards the speaker, lashing out with the wet end of an arm. Minato almost vomited as he was painted with viscera, questioning the life choices that led to such things twice in one day. The speedster sheepishly dropped the severed limb. His attention snapped to Pilot, his body half way through the door as he choked one of his compatriots to death. Event Horizon glanced between the two in confusion before focusing on Minato. The charismatic villain sighed long-sufferingly. \"Turns out the aliens aren't really aliens, they're critters that Pinnacle cooked up in a lab and this whole thing has been some colossal effort to make himself the new King of Earth. The mercenaries know we know and now they're trying to kill us.\" Event Horizon blinked several times before shrugging in acceptance.\n\n\"Alright then. I guess we're doing this.\" The speedster snatched up his staff and hurtled into the hallway, seeking his targets like a bloodhound. He tore through another squad of mercenaries without effort before sliding to a stop in one of the many hallways. Event Horizon stood still, his staff dangling limply from his fingers, and gawked at the sight before him. What little of Baron Rotezhan's body remained lay scattered across the floor, whisps of shadow slowly evaporating off of his charred remnants. The speedster was so shocked that he failed to notice his comrades slamming to a stop beside him; Minato drew a shuddering breath at the sight while Pilot whistled in astonishment. \n\n\"What...They...How the fuck did they kill Barghast?\" Kitsune stumbled over his words, the void-hound's death shattering his composure once more. His answer came in the form of Pilot body-checking him aside as a beam of intense light burned through the space he had occupied. More of these radiant waves flickered into life as Event Horizon exploded into action, dancing between the shining streaks. Minato curled into a ball as he hit the ground, grunting from the impact. His attention was drawn to the many seared holes now littering the floor, their edges still glowing from the intensity. A horrible thought came to him, bidden to mind by Barghast's blistered leftovers. \"It's some kind of focused ultraviolet emitter! They've got sunlight cannons!\" Pilot swore under his breath, readying himself for action. The prone duo watched as Event Horizon found himself with precious little footing with which to maneuver, wooden floor disintegrating around him. Shafts of light, power drawn directly from the Sun, emitted from massive spotlights in the rafters. These shafts of searing fluorescence circled the speedster, honing in on his frantic form, when something quite peculiar happened.\n\n\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!\" A nasally voice echoed through the room. \"For tonight's entertainment, I give to you a dozen dead stooges.\" Event Horizon was forgotten as the mercenaries searched for the origin of this proclamation. If a single freelancer had looked behind them, they would have noticed a diminutive figure held aloft by gently beating wings of leather. With a wicked grin on his demonic visage, the creature gestured at the spotlights. Each of them exploded in turn, sending rippling waves of metal and fire through the assembled forces. Their screams were like music to the impish creatures coriaceous ears. His cackles were heard over the cacophony, disturbing even the veteran super-villains. Once the chaos died away, a form made itself known from between the wreckage and shattered corpses. Floating demurely down from his perch was a red-skin creature, diminutive in stature and slight of build. Once it's cloven hooves scrapped lightly against what little floor remains, the imp bowed it's horned head with a flourish. \"Greetings and salutations, good folk. My name is Patterdemalion, though you may call me Patters.\" \n\n\"Uh...hi?\" Kitsune waved weakly at the demon as his compatriots stared silently. The snaggle-toothed creature smiled gregariously at the spirit medium. Minato coughed to clear his throat before returning the grin. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Patters. Please, call me Kitsune. My associates are Pilot and Event Horizon.\" He indicated each as he spoke before kneeling down. \"May I ask why you assisted us?\" Patters chuckled, sounding like nothing so much as a miniature hyena. \n\n\"You certainly may, master of the dead. I seek my brother, Tatterdemalion, and our lord, the Director. I sensed a dark presence here and hoped against hope that it may have been him but alas, I found no sign of them.\" Waving one clawed hand at the slowly cooking corpses, the mild-mannered hell-spawn giggled. \"I did, however, stumble across these bland fellows slaughtering the Shadow Hound. Such a shame for an unparalleled expert in bloodshed to meet his end in so ignoble a fashion.\" Shaking his head in genuine disappointment, Patters sighed. \"So I thought I would grant him the gift of vengeance. Truth be told, I had not realised there were others here though I am certainly glad to make your acquaintance.\" The demon spun gleefully in mid-air. Event Horizon and Pilot exchanged bewildered glances behind Kitsune's back while the charismatic criminal spoke.\n\n\"Let me assure you that we are quite pleased to meet you as well. It's quite the troublesome situation that we've found ourselves in and your help is most appreciated.\" Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of several VTOLs landing outside. Event Horizon zipped over to one of the windows, peering outside. What he saw elicited a growl of frustration from the speedster.\n\n\"Fuck me. There's another five of the damn things setting down. A couple of Talons in the sky as well.\" Minato sucked air through his teeth, his face pinched in worry. He turned to Pilot with a questioning glance. \n\n\"Each VTOL can contain thirty troops and equipment. Pinnacle had them built to his specifications, better than anything else in the world. If this is a cleanup crew, we're looking at one hundred men minimum.\" The report was delivered without emotion but Kitsune had grown used to determining his friend's feelings: Pilot was genuinely scared. \"I suggest a tactical retreat through the sewers, if we can remove the grates quickly enough. Otherwise, we have to try abandoning the facility by land...\" He shook his head with a pained groan. \"Not a good idea, not with that many feet on the ground and birds in the sky.\" Minato smiled, in what he hoped was a reassuring way, and clapped a hand on Pilot's shoulder.\n\n\"Then we should move as quickly as possible. Event Horizon, head down to the basement and see if you can get the grate off. Pilot, gather up as much equipment as you can and head down there.\" He turned to the expectantly waiting demon. \"Patters, would you mind assisting him with that task?\" The demon bowed once more and followed after the turncoat mercenary with a delicate flapping of his wings. Minato straightened his suit once more and sighed in aggravation. \"Alright Lawrence, where the hell are you?\" With limited time available, Minato decided to look the good old fashioned way: He summoned a host of ghosts and told them to find Lawrence. The spectres scattered across the museum before one of them reported in from the basement. Minato growled and ran as fast as his aching legs would carry him. He took the stairs down three at a time and found Event Horizon pulling Lawrence's corpse free from the armour. The teenager had a single bullet hole through his forehead and a comically surprised look on his face.\n\n\"Fuckers must have got to just as he opened it up.\" The speedster seemed uncharacteristically remorseful of the boy's death, laying him gently across the cold concrete. If he had time, Minato would have been surprised. As it was, the con-man was busy examining the welded grating. \n\n\"Do you think you can rip this off?\" His question was rebuffed as soon as it was asked as Event Horizon gave a regretful shake of his head.\n\n\"I'm not strong enough. The mercs made sure that nothing was getting in or out of here. Makes me wonder how long they've had this planned.\" The caffeine-addict growled angrily at the thought. There was silence for a moment as the two men recognised that, with no way to remove the grating, their deaths were imminent. \"Been a pleasure, pal.\" The declaration startled Minato. He sent a quizzical look at his compatriot, receiving a grim smile in return. \"I know enough about hopeless situations to recognise one. Just figured it was worth saying while I had the chance.\" Kitsune grinned ruefully at that.\n\n\"I suppose you're right. We had a good run, right? Might have even passed as heroes in the right light.\" The duo laughed uproariously at the concept, eventually devolving into hard breathing and laboured chuckling. Minato offered a hand and Event Horizon immediately seized it in a firm grip, the unlikely friends grinning at each other. \"I'm not much of a fighter so I apologise if I make you look bad.\" The speedster shrugged in response.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll take out enough for the both of us.\" There was a cough from the stairwell and they both spun, startled. Pilot was standing with a a duffel bag over his shoulder and a box under each arm while Patters hovered next to him, several crates floating behind them. \n\n\"Are we interrupting something? Because we can come back if you two want some privacy.\" The sarcasm was thick in Pilot's voice as the aerial ace dropped his cargo at their feet. The villains had the good grace to look sheepish. \"Where are we with the grating?\" Event Horizon gestured at it with his staff.\n\n\"I can't rip it off the wall. I'm strong but it's welded on pretty damn well.\" Spinning the unbreakable metal stick in a sweeping motion, Event Horizon bounced from foot to foot. \"So now our plan is kill as many of the bastards as possible before we go down.\" Minato nodded in agreement, ghostly flames howling into existence across his body. Pilot slapped his helmet in frustration.\n\n\"How have you two survived this long? We have an invulnerable rod for leverage and a now empty super-suit with strength enhancement.\" Silence reigned in the basement as the villains considered the train of thought. Event Horizon leaned casually against the wall while Kitsune extinguished his otherworldly inferno with an embarrassed cough. \n\n\"Yes, well...We knew that. Go ahead, Pilot.\" The gun-for-hire stared at them a long moment before climbing into the suit. It powered up slowly, the colossal machine stirring to life. Pilot's voice boomed out from the armour, unaffected as Lawrence's had been. \"Diagnostics say the suit's integrity is badly damaged and that mobility is shot to hell. I can get the grate open but I'm going to start the self-destruct sequence now, leave them a little surprise.\" The weakened suit lumbered forward, jerkily accepting the staff from Event Horizon. Pilot jammed the staff in between the grates and flexed his hydraulically assisted muscles. With much wailing and groaning of metal, the fixture finally popped free. Pilot jumped free from the armour and hefted the duffel bag, handing Event Horizon his staff as he went. \n\n\"We've got about two minutes to get as far away from here as possible. Let's not waste any time gawking, eh?\" With that, Pilot vanished inside the underground passage. Event Horizon sneered at the mercenary, leaning over to Minato.\n\n\"Is it just me or is he getting cockier? This is what happens when you give the help any leeway.\" Minato grinned back at him before following after Pilot, with Patters flying alongside him. Event Horizon looked around the basement once before zooming back upstairs. He piled furniture as high as he could in front of each doorway, blocking off as much as possible. More of Pinnacle's soldiers were already inside and they reacted with admirable speed, deconstructing his barricades almost as quickly as he put them up. The speedster smiled darkly to himself before hurtling down the passageway, counting down from 120 in his head.\n\nHe rejoined the group just in time for an explosion to roar into life, shaking the sewer tunnels with the force of it. The group looked around, dim light provided by a pair of glow-sticks hung across one of the duffel bags. Event Horizon clapped merrily before stretching.\n\n\"So, where to?\" The speedster looked expectantly at Kitsune. Minato started walking, desperately trying to avoid the sludge around him.\n\n\"I know a few people who would love to help us.\"",

        "text": "Back in my very early days of GMing I started with a campaign of Stars Without Number that focused with my as the GM and my friend as the sole character. Now, nearly four years later I return to that same idea with the help of Kevin Crawford's Stellar Heroes, which is a supplement to help make SWN more compatible to that sort of gaming.\n\nSome background: I created this campaign idea when I rolled up a planet and got a thinly atmosphered cold world covered in alien ruins and embroiled in a civil war. Taking that I structured the campaign around the [Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War) because I'm a huge history nerd. The planet of Regztem has been home to infighting for nearly a decade, as the two sides vie for control. It's home to the insectile species known as the Regztem, some popular traits being their sucking mouth parts, affinity for groups, and powerful pheromones. The 'Whites' or 'Loyalists' want to keep the established Council that oversees the matters of the people. The 'Reds' or 'Rebels' want to fall back on insect roots and establish an all-powerful queen to direct everything. The other planets in the sector are now worried about the scale of horrific warfare that is ruining the planet, and created the Allied Expeditionary Army composing of an infantry, armored, airborne, and artillery brigade. They shipped out from their various home planets to put a stop and assist the Whites (the legitimate government) in quelling the rebels.\n\nOur hero is Daraju, a drifter turned soldier. He doesn't use his last name because he had a falling out with his parents and is effectively blacklisted from his home. They were xenoagricultural engineers on Gollapralu and he picked up on some of those skills. But being a vagabond he signed up to join the AEA and help sort out the situation on Regztem.\n\nWithout further ado...\n***\nSpecialist Daraju ('Dar') is delivered to the camouflaged airfield by a naval courier, who quickly slips up into the atmosphere. The mood here is subdued and quiet, pilots and technicians are applying camouflage paint and other stealth-enhancing materials on the hulls of their transport gravshuttles.\n\nHe finds Colonel Lakshman Johar hunched over the constantly shifting CIC table, where images of drones and recon scouts are feeding video feed of the mountain objective from their view-ports and cameras. Her eyes are weary and drawn, she hasn't had sleep in a long time. She nurses a small cup of tea as some of the stress fades from her face. The toils of the commanding position are taken their toll on her. She greats Dar and shows him the preliminary feeds of Magadan Ridge, the ancient Reg temple from their prehistoric days.\n\nAnother entity enters the scene, a white-banded Reg officer serving with the loyalist 9th Artillery Brigade. The insectile alien is acting as a liaison with the Allied troops, and gestures in sign language as the proboscis-equipped Regztem are not capable of proper speech. He assures Colonel Johar that since Magadan Ridge is a holy site, there will be no heavy military presence, and that a swift operation of landing the troops on the flat promenades will ensure that the Loyalists hold the location, which is important to show their legitimacy to the conflicted species.\n\nAs the commanders discuss the logistics of the battle, Dar wanders to Shuttle #15, his assigned ride into battle. The crew are finishing up their pre-flight checklists and are eager to make small talk. The engineers assigned to #15 ask Dar if he can perhaps pick up some gunnery weapons, as the soldiers of the AAB often travel light and fast for air deployment. Dar heads to the AAB quartermaster and ask about taking anything, and is given a broken burster beam anti-tank weapon for his troubles. He takes a few minutes, using the engineering skills his parents taught him, and manages to fix up a few frayed wires. They have anti-armor capabilities now, and the men are grateful.\n\nThe call is soon given and the gravshuttles take off in their approved patterns and waves. Their ship breaks off from the rest though, as their mission is not part of the direct assault. Dar and the four engineers are to recon the base of the mountain for any possible cave entrances that could be used as a means of access or escape points for the Red Regz holed inside.\n\nDuring the ten minute flight the engineers check the wiring on the demolition charges they carry in a rather cumbersome grav crate. Dar checks his weapons. Laser rifle slung on the side, thermal pistol snug in its holster, mobile cover shield affixed to forearm, and his metastasis wraps firmly snug over his hands. Due to the cold climate and thin atmosphere of Regztem the men are equipped with thermal underwear and atmofilters to supply needed oxygen.\n\nSuddenly the pilot curses and the passengers turn their looks through the viewports of the shuttle. The massive cloud of gravshuttles approaching Magadan Ridge are like little specks from here, but the laser fire coming from the rocky fortress is all too clear. The pilot assures the squad that AA fire was expected, but suddenly cuts and jerks again as little flecks start launching out of holes dug into the mountain base and rise. The Red Regz had moved in an air corps, and the nimble gravfighers start tearing into the slower and unwieldy shuttles.\n\nLaser fire is also turned on #15, fresh pangs of ozone wafting in the passenger hold as they ricochet and curdle off the hull. The pilot snaps at Dar for orders, if they get any closer to the mountain they could all get wiped out in one good AA hit. Dar gives them the okay to land at their current position, which is about a mile away from the slow rise of Magadan.\n\nThe shuttle takes off and blasts through the withering laser fire, rocketing back to refit and ready itself for wave 2 of the assault. Dar gathers the men. Two carry the demo charges, and two provides over-watch on the flanks while he takes point. With time not on their side, he forgoes stealth and charges through the wispy underbrush.\n\nHe notices commotion up ahead, the strange twittering speak of the Regz. He peers from his cover and sees four harried regz medics are a large group of twenty-six regz civilians, laid out on bedrolls and being administered with what appears to be breathalyzer tests. Their chitin is off-color and they appear sickly. Not wanting to start a scene, and with this group being civilians, Dar orders the engineers around stealthily. Each goes one by one until he's last to pass, and accidentally steps on a stick. One of the medics panics and starts to investigate. They are armed with pistols, but don't seem too keen on fighting. Dar and the medic see each-other at the same time, and the human soldier holds up his hands and tucks the rifle away, trying to get across he means no trouble. The medic studies him, twinkling geodesic eyes belaying confusion, then nods. It walks back to its patients, leaving Dar alone.\n\nHe regroups with the engineers behind some low boulders. The corporal points out a large arching cave mouth and what seems to be a Red Regz supply base inside. It could be a good access point into the base. Dar orders them up slowly, jumping into a closer position with over-watch of the cave opening. One of the engineers points out movements, and the group witness two young regz running along the smooth wall, grabbing a crate, and quickly escaping with its contents. Dar orders the squad to the crate to check its purpose while one of them scouts the cave complex. It appeared the crate used to hold grenade (or eggs?) and this worries Dar. The engineers reports that there are five regz technicians loading a freight elevator with ammunition. Dar orders a pincer movement to break up the squad, having the two bomb carriers stay behind. Once in place, they are to create a diversion to draw out the regz techs.\n\nThe three soldiers break up into their left/right/center formations, but one of the engineers triggers his diversion early, thumping his rifle butt against a crate. The five regz techs drop their crate and rush to investigate the disturbance, already on edge because of the ensuing battle up top. Dar and the other engineer jump up to start, laser fire winging and cutting across the warehouse sized cave complex. Dar chose careful rifle fire as the two engineers stitched the air with crackling energy. One of the insect techs was cut down by laser fire, but another of their number grabbed the diverting engineer, dragging him to the ground screaming as it plunged its proboscis repeatedly into his chest, killing the humans. Dar and the survivors spread out, with the two bomb carriers leaving the charges behind to rush and avenge their fallen brother, gunning it down as it still hunched over the corpse. Dar tangled one-on-one with another regztech, crushing its head armor but getting his atmofilter mask bashed in the process.\n\nWithin a few more seconds the air cooled from the sizzling laser bursts, and two regz were fleeing to the freight elevator. Dar took careful aim and shot both to wound, causing them to be crippled and trip upon the ground. The soldier and three engineers quickly assessed the situation, retrieving the dog-tag of their fallen comrade and moving to check the wounded aliens. Dar had the engineers restrain the two techs against a handrail, and attempted to treat one of them. But his lack of knowledge in their exotic biology created a traumatic nervous breakdown, killing the captive. The other one clams up and refuses to 'talk'.\n\nThe squad enters the freight elevator and mount up around the few crates on its scratched up platform. Dar presses the button (not understanding Regz script) that he believes denotes the upper floor, and they ride. When the doors open they are greeted with the sight of a Red Regz gunner firing its anti-air turret into the sky, warding off the AAB gravhuttles as the fighters continued to pick them off like hawks. The squad moved in as Dar ordered the engineers to target the gunner while he dealt with the loader/guard. He shouldered his laser rifle and unclipped his thermal pistol, crouching and shuffling close. A quick blast from the powerful energy weapon riddled the loader, whose chitinous corpse collapsed. The squad moved to open fire on the gunner, but a piece of debris fell among them. Thinking it was a grenade they dove for cover. With the loader gone, Dar focused on the turret as well. As he attempted to open up the power charge on the energy weapon started to crackle and spurt uncontrolled energy, burning his hands. The soldier cursed and cast the gun down, deciding to run in and clamber atop the turret and try to reach in and grab the alien attacker, who know realized it was under attack. The engineers were afraid to open fire with their squad leader right in the lane of fire. Eventually Dar realized his efforts were futile, and dropped to the ground. This opened up an opportunity for the squad, who gunned down the regz.\n\nWith the situation in control, the squad saw the downed hulk of a gravshuttle lying on its side on the promenade, with five soldiers prone and trading fire with a large group of Red Regz soldiers. Laser fire was filling the air, making it hot and hazy as Dar ordered his men into action. One of the engineers mounted the turret and turned it on the alien aggressors, and soon there were five dead regz. Another engineer was killed however, as he poked his head above the wall to shoot a target and was hit directly. The others started to retreat for a large set of hardened bolthole doors leading into the mountain's core. One of the two surviving engineers killed one of the fleeing regz, but four of them made it to safety possibly alerting allies.\n\nDar and the engineers connected with the five surviving troops from the gravflyer. The sergeant in charge thanked Dar for the back-up, and offered the idea of chasing down those regz that headed into the bolthole. Dar ordered the engineers to plant the demo charge as he took a minute to catch his breath. The sky still shook with the frantic combat as the gravshuttles tried to evac any wounded back to base, but were sacrificed as they were cut down by the Red gravfighters. Feeling slightly refreshed, and done mourning the two dead on his hands thus far. He rose to his feet and marched to the bolthole door. The engineers readied the demo charge and the five soldiers formed into firing position. He gave the command.\n***\nI am extremely pleased with how Stellar Heroes plays out for the game, creating a perfect system to utilize with 1 PC and help focus the action and combat on them, still making it dangerously close to as deadly as 'pure' SWN but much more cinematic! Will continue to update on the progress of the war as we continue to play!",

        "text": "Hello everyone! How are you all. I usually lurk around looking for good stories to read when I get breaks or if there is nothing to do around here at work, but since today seems to be particularly slow, I thought I'd go ahead and chronicle my first forays into the Tabletop RPG world. I have what I see as 3 very good stories for you all from back when I was in High School. At this time I was going to my local gameshop and being introduced to the world of MTG (8th Edition and Mirrodin Block if you know it), Warhammer, and that ever valiant Pen and Paper game, D&amp;D. From this time period, I have 3 tales that have shaped me and how I learned about the basic Dos and Don'ts from the game. Our DM was a good man, and instead of starting us off with 2.0 or 3.0 or even the Brand spanking new 3.5, he started us out on AD&amp;D. Ahh, I even have the books he gave me when I started experimenting on DMing on my own. But that is a plot point for later in these tales.\n\nSuffice to say, as my standard go to, I decided to make an Elven Wizard in our game and learn the basics from that. Which turned out to be harder than I thought but I relished it and loved playing the class. I could just go invisible, sleep everything (and keep my invisibility, low level invis didn't drop unless attacking), and let my party kill anything else while I attempted to help out with anything else. It was simple times and I attended each time that I could. Unfortunately I couldn't attend every single time because as a kid, I was still in High School and I was in a part time job to help pay for the car that was as old as I was. None the less, this time I was around for the party and what would be a pretty significant point for our game.\n\nOur party (I can't remember the full consistency) was just making our way back to the entrance of a Crypt/Catacombs for whatever reason. We knew we haven't explored it fully, but at the same time we accomplished what we needed to and we've been in it before so we knew we could easily come back whenever we wanted. I wasn't around for the first foray into the dungeon, however since it was the second time, they told me about one particularly nasty trap to watch out for in the first room. The catacombs were 100% underground with the entrance being in a hillside that immediately descended on a spiral staircase. At the bottom of this staircase was a door (Apparently significantly dented from when our Dwarven Cleric [SHIELD SURFER] decided to ride his shield down the stairs). Inside this first room was 5 tombs. 4 in each corner, with the 5th along the center wall in the back. The odd thing to note here was that the walls were covered in a Greasy like substance and that in the ceiling, were 5 holes that were place directly over the tombs themselves. VERY SUSPICIOUS!!!! Not really though, The group told me and we were able to avoid activating the trap easily. Going through that 5th tomb which was actually the entrance into the proper Catacombs, making sure that we placed the lid back on properly while we delved into the dungeon. \n\nAnyways we advance the game time by 2 or 3 days and we are making our way back to the entrance to get out. First was our Fighter Half-orc[HANDSOME DEVIL] leading the party out. Followed by myself with an OK compliment of spells, while the Ranger [FORGETTABLE ARCHER] and rogue [UNLUCKY SMARM] followed. SS was bringing up the rear. We get to the Tomb Entrance and HD has the prescience to open the lid a crack to see if there was anyone in the room, and that's when we found a BBEG waiting for us at the entrance to the room. And we could tell it was a BBEG that meant real serious business and very powerful, especially against level 3s and 4s as us. I could practically feel the Necromantic energy coming off him. He sported a Bald of Awesome, wore black armor, had an iron bound book at his side, and easily hefted a war-hammer with a single hand. Making us realize that he was a War-mage that specialized in Necromancy, standing between us and the only way out. We knew we had to defeat him in order to get out and so we opted not even to try and talk to him, just to throw off the lid and start swinging. Thankfully we were able to get Initiative first, with me being right after HD.\n\nHD Popped out first and rushed the Necromancer. Doing his best to try and get an attack in, which glanced off his absurd AC. *Fuck*. After HD popped out, I too popped out, moved aside to allow the next few people to come out, and subsequently fired off a Magic Missile, which did practically nothing. *Fuckity fuck*. Then FA came out and dodged the other way to release a few arrows at the BBEG, only to see them be as effective as wet noodles against the tyranny of a soup bowl. **God Damn Fuckity fuck!!!** US realized from watching the 3 of us open up on him that we stood no chance. This was going to be a TPK, unless we could find a way to kill a necromancer that was going to level us. It was then that US had a horribly evil and ingenious idea rolled up into one moment of true enlightenment. He realized what room we were in. He also remembered that the trigger for that room, was right next to the tomb that many of us just popped out of. He yelled out \"GET TO COVER!!!\" and stomped his foot down on the trigger, before jumping right back into the entrance of the crypt. Everyone in the room realized what he did in that split second, and the DM told us to make our Reflex Saves.\n\nHD was the first to decide on his Reflex save. He had to pick a direction and make a decently hefty roll. He chose the best one for his spot, which was one of the two closest to the door. I was the second to decide, and since I was near enough to the entrance tomb, but not enough, I dove for one of the corner tombs close to the back wall. FA was the last to decide, He decided to go opposite of me since he was in much the same position. The dice were rolled, results called out, and then the ceiling dropped. HD, made his roll and was safe in a hole. FA, made his roll and he too was safe in a hole. I, didn't make my roll and subsequently did my best squish impression. Then it was time for our Necromantic buddy to make his Reflex save to see if he could get out of the way of the trap. The DM rolled behind the screen, looked down, and muttered \"god dammit\" for all of us to hear. I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE IMITATING A PANCAKE! Our entire group was in a bit of disbelief, our DM most of all. He said that he rolled a 2 and that the guy still didn't make his roll. Eventually the group reset the trap and basked in their incredibly fortunate glory. Except for me because i was still dead at the time.\n\nIn the end, we looted the necromancer's corpse and came across several interesting things. The book was obviously evil and me being Chaotic Good and subsequently leaking fluid over the floor, didn't even get a chance to look inside of it. He had more than enough gold and gems on him to pay for my restoration AND resurrection with a nice boost in gold for us all when we got to the closest city from the crypt. And finally, it kicked off an entirely new plot point with the revelation that his war-hammer, is a sentient, evil, magic war-hammer which kicked off a war in order to control it, but I don't remember much of that (Because partly I wasn't there). No the truly interesting parts came a few months of Real Time later, when the DM started to teach me how to run my own games.\n\nWe were in the back of the game shop. I was listening to the DM go over how to make a good game and a good campaign and I was sitting there with rapt attention, even taking a note or two. I was decent with the mechanics and everything, that stuff was easy. He was teaching me more of the components of story and world building rather than the game itself. It was here that I learned a very important mechanic that was eluding me for the longest of times. People don't Role Play just to be railroaded on one story line! I've tried multiple times before online to try and make interactive and Role Playing stories, but I never realized why people dropped out even though they were eager to join at first. It had always annoyed me when they didn't follow the plot and do what I expected them to do. It wasn't until the DM was teaching me that I even realized. To drive the point home, he brought up the story I just told. I was confused, \"How was that something you didn't control? Was something different supposed to happen?\" He then told me that he was trying to get a TPK, He wanted to end the campaign for some reason (which now seems obvious) and he was throwing his most powerful character at us. He didn't expect us to survive, and when we did, well he had to think of something, which is where the War over that Necromantic Hammer came into play. To this day, it blew my mind and it's one of the things that I take to heart no matter what. Don't control what your characters do, Let the players control themselves and you can fashion a story around it. Still that doesn't help when your luckless rogue goes up against a certain card deck. But I'm afraid that will have to be another story, for another time. Till next time!\n\nTL;DR: How do you stop a TPK from wiping out your low level party? Ask the Wicked Witch of the East.",

        "text": "**He sees me. He actually sees me!**\n\n\nOf course Lana May knows she’s not invisible. As she sat sipping the tea Rin had made her, the emotions that had washed over her, raw and real, ebbed away. A calm replaced the worry, the sorrow, and the anger. She looked into the muddy eyes of the unlikely friend and for once felt different. Rin sat across from her, his fingers laced about his own cup, arms resting on the table, and looking Lana in the eyes with utmost concern. It was his eyes that seemed to pierce through her as they remained unwavering.\n\n\nLana wasn’t use to that; anyone showing genuine concern for her. Maybe her parents once looked upon her with similar care, but it must have been a time before she could remember. And Doctor Tomlund only looked upon her as a puzzle he couldn’t figure out. But Rin... he saw her. At first she hated that he made her feel, but whatever he used to make the tea kept her calm. \n\n\n**Of all places, why did I run here?**\n\n\nLana prided herself in suppressing her emotions. It was one of her hooks for control. But today she had felt real sorrow and cried blindly to Rin. Now he was watching her, waiting patiently, relaxed as though she hadn’t stood him up the day before.\n\n\nShe had found herself in a rather bad situation yesterday morning. Barut Mirehook, a local sleaze, had raped one of the tavern maids that worked the Inn Lana was staying at. The way he had persisted after the girl, grabbing her in spite of her polite refusals, was enough to connect him to the tears and bruises that covered the maid. Lana helped clean the girl up, suggesting she report Barut. A vile taste came to Lana’s mouth as the girl refused. She was being stupid, but then again, if she did speak up, would the authorities treat Barut in a similar manner that the judge treated her father?\n\n\nLana’s father had abused her for as long as she could remember. And when she was ten, her father deluded what she thought was love. It only lasted a few years, but the damage was done. Lana was sent away to an Asylum for the murder of her mother. She was returned to her father when she was sixteen, having been deemed suitable for society. By then her father had found another victim and Lana realized she meant nothing to him and that she was only desired for one thing. She took the matter to the judge, but because there was no proof of the incest and the town knowing her history, her father was left alone without consequence. For Lana, that was unacceptable. \n\n\nShe murdered her father in their barn. His new pet was there for their rendezvous, Lana loathing her for taking her father’s affections. After stabbing her father repeatedly, Lana carefully stabbed herself; once on her right arm and once in her stomach. She still remembers the fire that filled the wounds. She threw the dagger at the feet of the sobbing girl before running to tell a guard what had happened, how she and her father were attacked. \n\n\nBarut was going to have a similar justice paid to him.\n\n\nLana had attributed her talents to being something rather great. She had killed her father and conned her way back to the big city of Sharn without trouble. No kinks had come of the quick thought plans. But Barut was stronger and not one to let his guard down in the midst his lust. Lana had just reached behind her back to pull out the hidden dagger that was to bury itself into the man’s navel and work upward, when Barut grabbed her hand felt the knife. Lucky for Lana that she was quick. She maneuvered off of her target and jumped out the window. \n\n\nThe cold stone ground met her feet a second later and quickly she sprinted. She tore from her head the wig she had worn and could hear Barut shouting in pursuit. She unbuttoned the shirt, letting fall to the cobble stone. Lana could only hope that she would out pace him. She then noticed a young man running down the alley next to her. “Why girl running?” he had asked in a brisk whisper. “There’s a bad man after me,” Lana began letting the water works start. Tears always made men cleave to her cause. Soon she was directed into a side alley and through a plank of wood that hid a small room. As she stood, trying to catch her breath silently, she learned the young man’s name; Rin. \n\n\nHe was handsome enough. Short, somewhat untidy black hair, brown eyes that matched his earthy outfit, and dirt under his nails as though he’d been working a field or petting a horse. \n\n\nOf course today Rin looked cleaner. His skin was pink and his hair brushed. His clothes were the same browns and greens that hadn’t been cleaned in a month.\n\n\nAs they waited around, listening to Barut come and go, Lana knew she would need to return to the Inn eventually to retrieve her things. So she asked Rin if he’d watch her back. The man thought over the proposal longer than she had expected before giving a slow nod and raspy response of, “Rin wash your back... Lana wash mine. Yes yes! Rin wash your back!” And he had meant it. When she finally returned to the Inn to retrieve her gear, she heard from the wash room, “Rin washes back! Rin washes Lana’s back! Tub and bubbles!” over and over. He made so much noise he never noticed her entering the room and taking her things.\n\n\nBut here she was, staring back into the murky brown eyes that seemed clearer. Who she took for a creep seemed anything but. He was kind. Other men were kind. But something seemed so different about Rin. Perhaps it was the tea.\n\n\n“What has made Lana upset?” Rin asked finally.\n\n\n**Yes Lana. What has made you upset?** \n\nFor the first time, Lana didn’t feel like lying.\n\n\n✻  ✻  ✻  ✻  ✻ \n\n[Next Chapter](http://iadumija.blogspot.com/2016/07/i-wash-your-back-you-wash-mine-pt-2_18.html?m=0)",

        "text": "The crew were last seen being briefed by a mysterious stranger who had a job for them. We were to retrieve a \"hot chip\" from a company that manufactured them and bring it to a dead drop for 5,000 credits.\n\nThe plan was simple. Only she requested that the end result would be less explosive than their previous mission. Old man jenkins begrudgingly accepted it then walked off muttering about \"pointy ears hating on petunia\".\n\nThe general plan was for the Troll and The Dwarf to stake out the factory (after old man jenkins gave them the map and readout) and work out when the best time to strike would be. Only they had no car, Old man Jenkins wasn't gonna lend a Horn head like the troll wreck his bike. After all he had a hot date with the lovely Petunia coming up.\n\nWith minimal effort he loaded up the laptop retrieved from one of the gangsters last mission and found that the portly gang had a fairly spacious van located near the crater that was formerly known as their restaurant. So Old man Jenkins hotwired the van brought it to them and sent them on their way. While they were scouting, he bought an old radio from a junk shop and enjoyed a fine meal with Petunia while he worked on some identity cards for the crew.\n\nUpon their arrival back the plan was to smuggle the dwarf into the factory and under the cover of night plant a bug that Old man jenkins had made in the building. Then using that the dwarf would be able to sneak about and steal the chip whilst old man jenkins played havoc with the systems.\n\nFirst off, we had to stop the truck and steal it so we could get in. So we set up a distraction, by that I mean old man jenkins made the van look like it was crashed and was laying on the side of the road panting. The truck stops and out comes a driver. Old man jenkins asks the guy to get his inhaler as he's pretty sure that in addition to dying he's having a asthma attack. The guy buys it and heads over to the Van, leaving the truck running with a guard inside. As the guy approached the van the Troll ambushed him, the guard asked the old man if he needed help when he started wheezing. As he got closer the old man grabbed his wrist and let loose a stunning shock causing him to not only crash to the floor but piss himself.\n\nThey loaded the pair into the trunk and Old man jenkins, doing his best to annoy the troll, began singing convoy. Over and over. As they pulled up with the dwarf in place of the soylent food substitute passed through the gates and began unloading. The dwarf was put in the barrel storage and after loading up old man jenkins walked back to the truck and radioed the dwarf to begin. The Troll did it's best to keep everyone on the night team busy. (One chef and a manager)\n\nThe dwarf runs into the electric room and old man jenkins views from his bionic eye. He plugs in and goes to work, getting a full CCTV layout and the floorplan for underneath them. A new floor.....\n\nIn the space of 5 minutes, the plan has changed, we're going full out no waiting around. So the dwarf makes his way to one of the vents while the troll asks about the usual \"protocol\" given that they're the replacements for the 2 guards stuffed in the trunk. Old man jenkins is currently on radio to the dwarf telling Petunia that she's not allowed to cause any explosions and that their relationship can wait till after the job. The dwarf muses and looks down a vent, \"See anything old man jenkins?\"\n\nOld man jenkins mentions there's a laser system below so to be careful, by now the cctv is looped upstairs but downstairs seems to be on a different grid altogether. The dwarf then barrels down the vent and winds himself. No alarms gone off though. As Old man jenkins hums the convoy theme to himself looking through CCTV his phone goes off,\nHornhead: old man turn off lights downstairs and ill go investigate with anklebiter.\n\nOld man jenkins shrugs and switches the lights off, anklebiter attempts to sneak into the security room. And alerts the guard, he then fires wildly in pitch black at the guy and after a prolonged fire and sword fight he kills the guard. Meanwhile the troll ambushes a security agent dispatched upstairs to turn the lights back on and shoves him into the produce room before going in the elevator down. The firefight however.... has attracted some unwanted attention from everyone downstairs and they've hit the panic button.\n\nIn an instant, old man jenkins is locked out of the system and the headset is filled with the sound of the alarm, He yells at the dwarf to get to the elevator and help the troll get the package.\n\nThey run to the location together, barging through security and the likes. As they arrive in the room they're greeted with a more.... macabre situation than they're expecting. The room is really a disguised operating theatre. A lifeless body lays on the table with a chip located next to him. The doctor located behind a screen yells \"DONT TOUCH THAT CHIP ITS COMPANY PROPERTY\"\n\nOld Man Jenkins yells at the dwarf through his headset \"Tell him to invent a fucking diet serum\" which the dwarf happily repeats. The Doctor throws off his labcoat and channels a spell, at that moment a drone walker comes out. It's a bipedal combat drone with sword arms designed for high intensity fights. Old man jenkins whispers to the dwarf \"They got a fucking rigger, bastard kicked me out the net. Bring me back the robot and i'll pay you 250 credits.\" The Dwarf yells \"CAN DO!\" and shoots the mage who had failed to hit with a spell and was reeling from the aftershock.\n\nHe turns his sights to the drone and wings it, \"STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY NEW ROBOT DAMMIT\" Old man jenkins yells down the headset. The troll rears back and charges into the robot who elegantly parries the first sword strike and cuts the troll pretty badly. With one huge swipe the Troll cleaves the bot in half. (Much to the dismay of Old man Jenkins who screams at the dwarf to kick the trolls ass) With the machine wrecked the rigger is ejected forcefully and before he can act Old Man Jenkins manages to get into the poor sods head and locks him out of his own mind. He falls in a panic with the memory of \"Don't fuck with old man Jenkins\" embedded into his mind.\n\nThe pair grab the chip (and the robot) and make their escape. Old Man Jenkins alerts them that two tuskfaces are currently stood by the truck and he can't start the thing without them loading bullets galore into the grill. As they get close to the doors Old Man Jenkins raises the shutters for the delivery bay remotely and the dwarf chucks the robot in. The troll elegantly explains that they need to get out of here before they die and as they're pulling away the rapid deployment security team turn up. A host of 6 trolls armed to the teeth look at our party. Old man Jenkins grasps petunia and reassures her \"Soon mon doux hag de graisse\" readying the arming cap on his belt.\n\nThe troll explains the situation and tells the security team that the troll chef has gone mad again. The team wave us off as we ride away to swap the truck and make the drop. We each receive a notification of a transfer and head back to our safehouses. Old Man Jenkins pays the dwarf and walks off with petunia on his shoulders singing the Convoy song over and over.",

        "text": "This happened about 2 years ago so I don’t remember all the little details. The party was sent by a local leader to track down and eliminate a nearby Dragonborn (or possibly Half dragon) fighter. He was attempting to create an army of kobolds so he could take over the city and create a small city for dragons and kobolds. Obviously, the town was not going to let that happen.\n\nThe party consisted of:\n\n**The Pebble** (Frontline tank) was a Dwarf warblade in stone armor who was too stubborn to move in combat (mainly focused on Stone Dragon discipline stuff)\n\t\n**Thonk** (Toolbox) was a Orc Rogue whose strength was in the 30’s but intelligence was 4. The party did not allow him to have any sharp weapons (for his own safety)\n\t\n**Yona** (Healer) was a Gnome Druid who would usually ride around on her animal companion (wolf) instead of walking. She was the party’s only real source of healing.\n\t\n**Larry** (Charging THF) was a Human Barbarian who loved to charge and hit things with his great axe. Sadly, he wouldn’t stop to think about whether it was a good idea.\n\t\t\nOnce the party arrived at the house of the BBEG, they decided to split up and search the rooms just like Scooby and the gang. The Pebble and Yona went to search in the library for any information about the BBEG’s plans. Thonk saw something shiny and went to go investigate and Larry was left in the main hall. Our barbarian friend decided he would go kick down a few door and search for clues. He walked up to the first door he saw and kicked it down. The door flung open to reveal a dark study. Larry was not a fan of books, so he decided to move onto the next door. Door #2 was a bit harder to open but he eventually kicked it down (I still don’t know why he had to kick down every door instead of opening them like a civilized person). The second room was a large bedroom that had all the furniture inside tossed around. Larry started to poke around in search of any helpful information. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes of complete silence from their illiterate partner, The Pebble and Yona began to think that he got himself into trouble again and went looking for him. They found him unconscious on the floor of the bedroom with an open box on the ground next to him. They determined that he touched something that was laced with a sleep poison. The Pebble dragged him into the main hall and Yona inspected him to make sure he wasn’t going to die anytime soon from the poison. After she learned that he would just be knocked out for a while, she propped him up in a corner near the door. The group continued to search the house and discovered a bathroom, kitchen, dining hall, and a few other rooms before Thonk found a secret passage behind a wall in the study. The party gathered around Larry and attempted to figure out what to do with their unconscious battering ram. After several minutes of debate, they decided to lock him in the bathroom while they went down the passage. Before they left, Thonk left him with a loaf of bread and a knife in case he was hungry when he finally woke up. \n\t\nThe trio proceeded to the hidden path and slowly started making their way down the narrow hall. At the end of the passage, they found a lever that opened a hidden door to the library. The party then went back to bedroom to see if there were any secrets that the angry  missed. After a few minutes of looking around, the party found a trapdoor under the bed. Again, the party agreed to leave Larry the lumberjack in the bathroom while they went down to the next floor. They opened all the doors except for the door to the bedroom and moved on to the cellar. \n\t\nThey arrived in a room with 6 doors. The Pebble started walking down a random door and the rest followed him. They walked down winding passages and oddly shaped rooms. They became lost after a just few minutes. Yona attempted to follow their tracks back to the main room and the Pebble decided to use chalk to mark intersections they had already been through. After about 20 minutes of retracing their steps, they made it back. Thonk used his club to mark (break) the door the had been through. He thought that since it was clearly marked, they would know they had been there already. The trio chose another door and started making their way down the path. The Pebble and Thonk marked any intersections and doors they came across. \n\t\nWhile the party was exploring the cellar, Larry, slayer of doors, finally woke up from his poison induced nap. He noticed the loaf of bread and knife in his lap and figured it was a present from Thonk. The barbarian chopped his way out of the bathroom and made his way through the house looking for his party. Once he spotted a lone door at the far end of the main hall, he did what he does best (breaking things). He broke the door to the bedroom and discovered the trapdoor open near the bed. He wondered if it was open last time he was in there but quickly decided he didn’t care and jump in. After seeing that 1 door had been broken in the cellar, Larry broke a second. He proceeded down the winding hallway at full speed. \n\nAt the first intersection he came across, there was a bright flash of light and he found himself in a different intersection with a nearby door. He noticed light coming from below the door and he pulled out his axe. After a moment of preparation, the human battering ram broke down the door and blindly charged into the room. He quickly discovered the room was filled with kobolds praying to a wooden dragon statue in the center of the room. He charged into the closest enemy and swung as hard as he could. The kobold watched the axe fly right over its head and into the wooden statue at its side. All the kobolds began yelling in dragonic as they stabbed at the barbarian. After getting stabbed for what seemed like the 23rd time, Larry figured it was time to leave and fast. \n\nHe ran down the hallway and found a second door closed door around a corner. He decided he needed to hide from the kobolds and that room would do. Larry opened the door (like a normal human would), ran inside and slammed the door behind him. Sadly, Larry, being the group’s bad luck magnet, found himself in a room with the kobold’s dire weasels. Once the animals began to charge, Larry flung open the door and ran. He began running and met the kobolds at an intersection. The human Energizer bunny turned and ran down a different path. With the kobolds right behind him, there was a flash at the intersection. This time, however, Larry found himself in an old large library. There was another flash. \n\nThe rest of the party were continuing to explore the cellar when they saw a flash of light come from their left. They turned to see a group of very angry kobolds running at them with spears in hand. The Pebble moved in front of the rest of the party and stopped the kobolds. After a little while they defeated the kobolds and went to inspect the intersection. Thonk disappeared in a bright light only to reappear a few seconds later wrestling with a kobold. The oversized rogue was smiling and laughing as the kobold desperately tried to get away. Yona convinced Thonk to let go of the kobold and it sprinted away as fast as it could. The party decided to go on a small magical journey. The trio walked through the intersection and found themselves in a old library filled with kobolds and their careless axe wielding friend. Larry ran over to the rest of his party and they began to fight the kobolds. \n\nYona decided to use flaming sphere to quickly deal with the kobolds. The sphere lit the kobolds on fire. It also lit the rug and nearby bookshelf on fire too.. Thonk ran deeper into the library to try to get away from the kobolds and fire. He hid himself in a large pile of books and hoped the flaming kobolds didn’t follow him. The rest of the party continued to fight the kobolds. Some kobolds ran after seeing the room begin to fill with smoke. After a minute or two, the fight was over. When they began to patch up the barbarian, they noticed the rogue was gone. Yona started to track him down and the party followed. \n\nThonk began to hear light footsteps. They were getting closer, and closer. He began to panic again. He didn’t want to be attacked by flaming kobolds. He decided to jump out and swing at them as hard as he could. He thought that even if he didn’t hit one, they would still run away because he was big and scary. He jumped out of the books, closed his eyes, and swung his club as hard as he could. He felt it hit and he heard the body fly into the nearby wall.\n\nThe Pebble and Larry rounded the corner to see Yona’s lifeless body impact the wall in front of them. They rushed to see what happened and saw Thonk beating Yona’s wolf to death. With tears in his eyes Thonk turned to the party and said it was an accident. He didn’t want to kill the nice one or her furry pet. The Pebble and Larry couldn’t decide if they should kill him or bring him back to town for a trial. The smoke in the room forced them to make a decision fast. They chose to have him stand trial in town. They grabbed the bodies of the druid and her animal companion and put them in Thonk’s backpack. They began to wander the library looking for a way out. They soon found a set of large doors and they ran through. They had found the Dragonborn fighter they were sent to kill.\n\nLarry charged the fighter as fast as he could. The BBEG readied his spear and waited. Larry felt the spear pierce through his armor and plunge deep into his chest.  The Pebble watched as his friend was raised off his feet and thrown away by the fighter. The dwarf began to burn with anger and started his advance. He pushed through the hail of blows and made it to the fighter. The Pebble raised his hammer and with 2 hits, the Dragonborn was defeated. Thonk ran over to the barbarian and noticed he was still alive but bleeding out. The Pebble started walking to Thonk but was weakened from the fight. Thonk grabbed the first flask he could find out of his pack and poured it into Larry’s mouth. The barbarian died seconds later. The Pebble examined the flask and noticed Thonk had just poured acid, not a healing potion, into Larry’s mouth. The dwarf told Thonk to leave the bodies of their fallen party members and start running. If the Pebble ever caught up to him, Thonk was as good as dead. Thonk took off running deeper into the cellar. The Pebble dragged the bodies to his cart outside and brought them back to town for a proper burial. He never saw Thonk again. ",

        "text": "This is going to be one of my more shorter tales. So here it goes.\n\nI was running a small Pathfinder game for a bunch of friends over skype. They were all new to tabletop RPGs in general and were pretty eager to try out. So I found and ran for them Hollow's Last Hope, a rather nice and simple adventure path.\n\nI was lenient when it came to character creation. I told them \"Stick with core races and the core classes and base classes.\" We ended up with Eder the human sorcerer, a dwarf fighter, Gan the Half-Elf Bard, Jack the Elf Rogue, a human cleric and Minuano the human samurai.\n\nNeither me nor the Samurai's player realized he started off with a horse. We talked and set him up and got down the basics of what his class can do and somehow we skipped over the horse.\n\nSo three sessions into this module the party is wandering through the nearby forest near Falcon's Hallow to get to an abandoned dwarven monastery. They camp for the night in the forest and I call for a small break so we can grab food, water, etc. As everyone's relaxing and checking their classes to remind themselves what all they can do I hear this.\n\nMinuano's Player: \"...I have a horse.\"\nJack's Player: \"...Are you telling us that you had a horse all along and didn't know about it?!\"\nMinuano's Player: \"Yes.\"\n\nWe start up the session once more and I begin with this: \"As you wake up you find a horse standing over Minuano.\"\n\nJack: \"...Where did the horse come from?\"\nMinuano: \"It's been with us this entire time.\"\nJack: \"So are you telling me that this horse was sneaking along with use this entire time!?\"\nMinuano: \"Yes.\"\n\nCue the rogue just sitting there with this confused look upon his face that a horse was stealthier than him as the party gears up for the morning to continue. This became a recurring joke the entire session that the horse was stealthier than the rogue and that they should send it ahead to scout for people.   ",

After blowing up the roof within the first 5 minutes and killing everyone in sight, they are put to sleep and kidnapped by a girl in a suit named Fatherland, who orchestrated the attack. They are then brought to an unknown location and eat dinner with Fatherland. A heated debate then arises about the best Tarentino film, and what the hell happened in Pulp Fiction. After all of that, they decide to join forces with Fatherland after learning the West *literally nuked the entire Mideast* to preserve world peace.\n\nThe PCs then all get on a helicopter for their next mission... except one. A Japanese neo-samurai, who commits seppuku after his team \"betrays Interpol\". While Fatherland is deskpalming on the heli's dashboard, the team's medic manages to revive him, and another PC screams: \"YOUR! WAIFU! IS! SHIT!\" at the guy. Fatherland is fairly pissed off by the whole ordeal and starts flying the heli, with the neo-samurai still on the ground.\n\nFatherland starts blasting *Don't Stop Me Now* by Queen on the heli's loudspeakers. Very quickly, everyone safely on the heli dance to the song... Except that neo-samuari, who desperately tries to climb on the heli with a grappling hook the other PCs left him. Cue laugh from everyone in voice chat. Fortunately he got on after the song ended.\n\nIt was glorious and oh so stupid.",

        "text": "This was actually quite recent and the campaign is still going on, but this story was for me, too good to go unshared.\n\nSo let me set the scene. We, the party, consisted of me, a CN wizard that was a egomaniac after being thrown out of his homeland for being a bastard son, Valentyne, our halfling monk that insisted on carrying everything that we looted, Jaer, an elf that really, really wanted to be an arcane archer and finally, Berk a half-ork paladin.\n\nThis story takes place around level 3 in the main city of the homebrew setting. After one of the most sacred stones was taken from the temple we were sent to find it and ended up here following up on a thread about a dodgy deal going down involving the stone and one of the local noble houses.\n\nLong story short, we ended up investigating some spider cult activity after one of the house is abducted and used to create one of them. This leads us into the sewers where we meet a gigantic spider the size of a house just sitting in a burrow under the city square. Needless to say, we barely escaped with our lives.\n\nReeling from this encounter we went and visited the local thieves guild. We wondered if they had noticed the giant spider sat at their doorstep.\nTheir response, \"Oh, really, we hadn't noticed the giant fuck-off spider sat right on our doorstep, eating our clients.\" While we were there, we noticed that there were quite a few ratlings and were-rats (In our setting we are more tolerant of non-humans). They said that they had seen some people, hooded and cloaked, checking out a particular spot in the sewers. We jumped on that plot point and asked them to take us to it.\n\nWe reach the place and it is marked with black as soot burn marks. Naturally we decided to try and find secret passages, so I cast detect secret doors. There was nothing there. Valentyne took that as a challenge. He proceeded to start hacking at the wall with his pickax. He rolled a 20. So, he hacked huge chunks of rock out of the wall, nothing. So Berk tried, another 20. More chunks were ripped out of the wall. Finally, Jaer tried and rolled an 18. We had by now, ripped the wall apart and the GM was looking at us like \"Wtf are doing? I told you there is nothing there!\" We took the hint and decided to stake it out.\n\nLater, about 6 hours later, a hooded, cloaked man approached the wall. He proceeded to say:\n\"What, what the fuck happened to this wall? It's fucking gone.\"\nSo, we jumped him. Guess what, Valentyne rolled two 20s on his social tests and Berk rolled anther one on top of that.\n\nSo he divulged all the cult's secrets and the GM has his head in his hands whispering \"What the fuck, three 20s. That was 4 sessions worth of content.\"\n\nNeedless to say we got our comeuppance later, I will maybe share that story later.\n\nTL;DR: Found a massive spider, hacked a wall to pieces and forced our DM to spoil four sessions worth of content after three 20s.",

        "text": "So one day, one of my friends got D&amp;D 5e and invited me to his group to play. After a while I got into it. Here is our group:\n\nA CG half-Orc Barbarian who is always itching for a fight\n\nAn LN Elf Wizard who looks down on everybody (which sometimes gets us in trouble)\n\nAn LG Halfling Cleric who becomes the party face and always has an optimistic look on things\n\nA CN Human Rogue who's mostly just here because the Cleric is paying him to\n\nAnother Human Rogue, this time CG after the above Guy's character died and he had to make a new one\n\nA NG Elf Monk (me) who is a soldier that's helping them because my supervisor ordered me to (long story)\n\nWe go on a campaign to try and get rid of all the goblins, since they are a serious problem here. We start by pretty much killing an entire cave, where we find out that an outside force was influencing them.\n\nWe all had our things. The Barbarian pretty much acted like the Heavy from TF2. The elf got us in trouble on more than one occasion by talking down to authority. Both incarnations of the Rogue were pessimists and acted like Han Solo before Leia showed up. For my guy, not much. His catchphrase was \"Well, I guess tonight's the night when b-----s die...\" which he said before starting to attack. Our characters started bonding like brothers over adventure.\n\n8 levels later, we found the BBEG, some wizard who wanted to take over the kingdom or something. The Wizard and the Cleric were pretty much incinerated, and the Rogue was badly hurt. We could tell the BBEG was about to die. Then, he used some hypnosis spell on my guy.\n\nHe killed the Rogue with two punches. The Barbarian lasted a little longer, but he was knocked unconscious. Then my guy FINALLY broke from the trance and Flurry of Fist'd the BBEG to kingdom come.\n\nThen emotions kick in. The Barbarian failed his death saving throws and died. Tears welled up in my monk's eyes as he looked at his fists. After an hour of in-game silence, he finally said something.\n\n\"I promise... never to use these again...\"\n\nI said he went into a life of recluse. A lot of tears were shed that night.\n\nA month later, we started a new campaign. Everyone had similar characters, except I was doing a Bard, who later multiclassed as a Fighter.\n\nA while into the campaign, we met my character's father, who was some old dude who ran a tavern. He forced us to let him come along with us so he could \"keep his girl safe...\"\n\nHe basically was an over-glorified NPC who would stand from a distance and shoot things with his crossbow. He was slow, and in some cases he was more trouble than he was worth (for example, when he was captured by a cult and we had to rescue him). The only reason we kept him is because my character insisted on it.\n\nFlash forward to a boss battle. He already knocked our Wizard unconscious, and he was beating us badly. The father was just standing back in fear.\n\nAfter he had us mostly incapacitated or knocked out, he started monologuing about how Elves were superior to humans (long story again). While this was happening, there was looks of conflict in the father's eyes. Eventually, he looked at his hands and said-\n\n\"Well, I guess tonight's the night when b-----s die...\"\n\nHe OHKOs the boss with Flurry of Fists. He  turns around and throws one of the boss' minions off a cliff, and intimidates the other to his knees before he destroys him with a single punch.\n\nThe table is silent as I slap down his character sheet onto the table. It is only now they realize both of my characters share the same last name.\n\nThat is probably my best experience with D&amp;D yet.",

        "text": "From snippets you have heard on the street, and that little time you spent in school, a little over 900 years ago, the universe was embroiled in conflict. One man wearing a suit wandered into the midst of this conflict and brought peace. A peace that has lasted ever since. A peace that has been heralded as the World of Progress. \r\nThe World of Progress is the dream of one man… Mr Slayer. His company, SLA Industries, owns everything, from the concrete beneath your feet to the air you breathe up to and including 99% of the known universe. S.L.A. Industries is Mother, Father, Brother, Lover.\r\nAt the heart of the world of progress stands the monstrous city of Mort city that you call home. Styled like a gigantic pyramid, the city is the capitol of the World of Progress, and an example of the power of SLA. At the very top, at the apex of the glass pyramid is Mr Slayer. Flanked on both sides by the elite, handpicked, Black Chapter bodyguard, he looks over the city he created. He watches. Not even his closest allies know what he is watching for, no one dares ask. Mr Slayer’s vigil is not disturbed or hindered by the constant stream of rain running down the window. In one extent Mr Slayer is a lucky man, for up here in the Head Office, the rain has not been tainted yet.\r\nOutside of The Head Office, sits Central. The main government offices are situated here, surrounded by a ring of town houses and parklands; the playground of the rich and powerful. Appearances are everything here, but due to the constant rain revolves around fancy umbrellas and galoshes. The rain here is just as prevalent at all over Mort. Unfortunately, being situated directly under Head Office, the rain contains all of the run-off from the level above, and has picked up a certain… texture along the way. The posh glitterati do not care though; they are far too busy jostling amongst themselves for political and social position to worry. After all, the closer to The Head Office you are, the more important you are. A few of the wealthier socialites have even taken to voluntarily getting Nuke Tendon implants. These citizens, proud of their newly found muscles strut through the Central streets in their exquisitely tailored suits just to get noticed.\r\nIn the middle of Central, and outside of the lavish town houses and swanky night spot, massive office blocks stretch far above the streets. These buildings house the municipalities that keep a city alive. A river of red tape runs through this section of Central, stacks and stacks of forms pertaining to every little section of the city flow through pneumatic tubes from office to office ever second of every day. This is the section of the city that never sleeps, however the socialites would have it differently. This is the beating heart of Mort city, controlling every aspect of life in the city. The tall buildings, housing everything from the secret police Cloak Division, all the way to the poor souls in charge of the sewer maintenance section, stretch all the way to the ceiling some 1000 meters above the streets, supporting Head Office in more ways than one.\r\nHere in Central is the Blue Print News hall where the SLA Operatives come to collect their missions. The SLA Operative is the hard hitting force of SLA Industries. Queues snake out of the Blue Print News hall, or ‘Slayer’s Crib’ as the Operatives almost affectionately refer to it, and into the distance. The waiting here is interminable, and endless, with hours and hours wasted to find a simple sewer clearance mission. No wonder then, that most SLA operatives hire a financier to cherry pick the BPNs for them.\r\nTrained by the university Meny, the Operatives are trained in anything from infiltration and assassination, through field medicine, to piloting one of the numerous SLA vehicles. The Operative is under almost constant surveillance from either Cloak Division, Station Analysis, or the News crews of 3rd Eye news. If the operative performs well, a slot on the daily news awaits them, whereas a poor performance will earn them a seat at a Cloak interrogation table. Even the most powerful of operatives will shiver and writhe when Cloak Division are mentioned, their grey APC herald no good news, and strike fear into all who see them.\r\nThe Operatives role is simple, keep the piece by thwarting any of SLA Industries’ competitors, and look good doing so. Every time a ‘soft company’, or corporate terrorist from any of SLA’s competitors appears to wreak havoc on Mort, the Operative will be there to stamp them out. Whether it be fully armed Thresher™ power suits, Dark Knight butchers, or the diminutive Tek Trex robotic drones; the SLA Operative is fully trained and equipped to deal with all who face them.\r\nBelow Central sits the larger area of Suburbia. The endless tower blocks and flats stretch up to the roof, meeting the floor of Central, some 1000 meters above. Under Central, the rain is thicker, and has a noticeable brown quality to it. Suburbia homes nearly all of the office workers and Operatives that call Mort home, and as such, is a hive of activity at the morning and evening rush hours. The residents that call this area home are glad of the extra protection the Operatives offer. They can be loud neighbours, but at least they do not live in Downtown.\r\nThe sprawling mass of Downtown is more of an organic mass than an area. Gangs of feral youths roam the streets looking for their next fight, be it with a rival gang or the local Shiver police unit, they do not care. The normal citizens are a jaded bunch, and who can blame them? All they see of the uptown residents is the sludgy rain dripping from the ceiling as the natural rain has picked up the detritus and waste from the levels above. Walking out without an umbrella or some sort of covering brings the citizens under serious risk of disease. Not many citizens venture out and about in Downtown, the tall buildings crammed to bursting with diminutive flats and bedsits are connected to neighbouring buildings with catwalks and crawl boards. Some residents of these blocks never leave the safety of their flats from birth to death, content to collect their benefits and watch the tube.\r\nThe television sets in Mort city are never off, and seem to be almost indestructible. The constant stream of propaganda they spew out is designed to keep the fragile populace from rioting. From the latest gladiatorial death matches on the Contract Killer circuit, all the way to the adverts for the latest SLA industry drug, and the unmentionable skin channels, the TV acts as a measure of control in a sector that seems to be hours away from tearing itself apart.\r\nTired of living in this squalor, you decide to better yourself and enrol in Meny, the SLA Operative university. Lining up on the spaceport with a group of other cadets, you grip your belongings closely, and never look back…\r\n",

The party was in honor of their God, Yaroowa, the great snake in the sky. They believed that the tear in the shield was actually a snake that watched over their world. So the party listens and moves on, thinking nothing of the catfolks stories. So they head out and search for the location of the power converter to get the shielding back at full capacity. A while of shenanigans later involving lizard folk, poison mushrooms, and projectile vomiting and explosive dihharea, and they finally arrive at the power converter only to find that sahuagin have taken over. The players, not wanting to risk any damage to the power converter, decide to talk to them instead of slaughtering them. They find out that the facility the power converter is in (inside a cliff wall) is the sacred gateway for their God, and by extension heaven. In order to enter that building they must prove that they are worthy, in this case they had to exterminate their long hated harpy adversaries. They get a guide to lead them to the harpy nest in the mountains to the north, which they make in record time since I rolled poorly on the random encounter table. They climb the mountain with only a few near death falls (from the super athletic barbarian no less) and arrive at the harpies mountain overhang nest. The barbarian decides to rush in ahead of everyone, screwing the rogue out of stealth, and starts going murder rage on them. The fight is fairly even throughout but the players are starting to lose ground. That's when shit got turned upside down. In my games I use a fumble chart if the players or enemies critically fumble. Well, the harpy leader critical fumbled and rolled the worst possible single roll, with only a 1 in 1200 chance (d100 and then a d12), the harpy attacked the barbarian with all her might while he, enraged, parried at full strength causing a tear to form in reality summoning an ancient black dragon for 1d4-1 rounds. *rolls* Oh that's a 4 so 3 rounds. So this dragon is pissed off and starts wrecking shit, first thing it does is bite one of the nearest enemies, the rogue. It hits and picks him up in his mouth then breaths acid at the remaining harpies and rogue, melting the harpies and a large part of their tree, while the rogue struggles to both not get swallowed and not die from the damage by chugging all of his stockpiled healing potions, while thanking his luck he bought armor of acid resistance after the fiasco with the slimes. At the end of the third round the dragon flew up to fly away since the other players were hiding in caves and under trees and then the dragon vanishes, leaving the rogue to fall and go unconscious on the mountainside with only a few hp from outright death. The party, being the show offs they are, tell the bewildered guide that they are the ones who summoned the dragon and that they are so powerful that the rogue was never in danger, that they just were playing a prank on him and laughed it off. Fast forward to when they get back to  the sahuagin tribe. The party brings back the harpy heads and are celebrated as heroes, especially after the guide tells their tale with his own awe of the players to shade the tale in their favor. The party then goes to the \"temple\" and find that the power converter is being blocked by some sort of creature which is in a stupor from the power flowing into it. The players are told that it is the sahuagin God called Sorkalla. They are left to speak with their God on their own after the rogue talks then into leaving them alone, since \"they may be powerful, but not as powerful as a god\". This is when they decide to murder the crap out of the \"God\" and fix the power converter. At this point it settles in that they have to come up with a reason for what just happened or they have to slaughter the sahuagin, and they were growing fond of them so they didn't want to kill them. This is when the hunter, who says practically nothing, decides that he will speak to the sahuagin, but talks to the rogue in private first. He waits for the sahuagin to come back and says \"I am Sorkalla, I have taken this vessel to walk the land once again, to prove it I will now slay the false God, Yaroowa!\" As he says this he heads outside and yells as loud as he can \"By my will, this false God shall be banished for all eternity!\" And as he says it, the rogue flips the switch to turn the converter back on and the sky goes dark and you can see the stars, then it crackles back and tendrils of the shield rebuild until it is all fixed and it is full day again. The sahuagin believed every word and now worship him as their God. And that's the story of how my players essentially killed two gods and become one in one fell swoop.\n\nTL;DR, my players find out the the tear in the shielding is worshiped as a God by one group of people, then they go to fix the shield, find out the facility is inhabited by what another group believes to be a God and then kill that \"God\", fix the shield, \"killing\" that \"God\", and then convince the people that they are the God from that facility, but inhabiting a human host.",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of the previous story '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and the Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 6, which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4rbufj/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Previously, our intrepid criminal saviours dealt with the ramifications of destroying a Zel'tan attack craft. Event Horizon managed to pull Kitsune out of his Villainous Blue-Screen of Death just in time for the group to encounter The Resistance TM. Having Convinced them to bring Kitsune and Event Horizon back what little command structure remained, their kindness was repaid with enslavement. Once their wills were smothered by the pervasive influence of the charismatic villain, reports came in regarding the presence of an alien flag-ship containing captured humans. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\nReconvening was a surprisingly quiet affair: Accompanied by half a dozen of the Resistance's best agents, Kitsune and Event Horizon emerged from the subterranean labyrinth as the VTOL touched down in the abandoned street. Barghast turned to inspect the soldiers with an appreciative glint in his bestial gaze as his underlings began to load equipment into the large aircraft. Minato shot him a warning glance before striding up the loading ramp, activating his communicator as he went.\n\n\"Kitsune to all units. Does anyone have eyes on a Zel'tan vessel above Madison Square Garden? Sarge?\" There was a brief burst of static before the stoic commander responded. \n\n\"Yes sir. Satellite coverage indicates that it hasn't moved since the assault began but none of our scouts have pushed that far into the city yet.\" Kitsune smiled darkly as Pilot emerged from the cockpit. Patting the aerial expert on the shoulder in an almost friendly manner, Minato cleared his throat and addressed everyone on the frequency.\n\n\"Alright, change of plans. We're going to drop the scavenged equipment back at the F.O.B and then we're going to hit the prison ship.\" His team had gathered around by this point, watching the charismatic villain espouse his grand plan. \"We'll lead a small strike team into the heart of the vessel, liberate the human captives and generally cause as much chaos as we can.\" Event Horizon raised one hand, like a child with a desperate question for their teacher. Kitsune grinned and pointed at him. \"Question one to the fellow with the large stick!\" \n\n\"Thanks, happy to be here. How do you expect us to get up there without being blown to pieces? They've got like...\" The speedster's face scrunched up in thought before turning to Pilot. \"Help me out here. How many of those Talons do they have?\" Pilot shook his head before answering, amusement thick in his tone.\n\n\"At least two dozen. If we're being honest here, they might have as many as fifty.\" Event Horizon gave a nod of thanks and gestured idly towards the masked man. \n\n\"So, let's assume that we have the minimum of flight-capable ass-holes trying to stomp on our parade. We have one VTOL and no other air support.\" Barghast slinked alongside him, his lupine head bobbing in agreement. His words were full of hissed irritation and barely restrained violence.\n\n\"The speed-touched is correct. There is simply no possibility of triumph against such an overwhelming opposition.\" The nightmare-made-real paused at the dark grin sent his way, eyeing Kitsune warily. The smooth operator raised one hand to dissuade further questioning before he spoke.\n\n\"And that, my dear compatriots, is where you are all quite wrong. I have recently discovered another asset at out disposal, equipped with exactly the tools we require: A penchant for distraction, aerial capability and the weaponry required to at least damage Talon fighters.\" His digits curled inwards one-by-one until only his index finger remained straight. The assembled group turned as a single entity to follow Minato's gesture. Silence reigned over the street corner as each individual contemplated the potential gain of such a plan. It was Barghast who broke the reverie.\n\n\"That may actually work.\" His sinister drawl did nothing to ease Lawrence's nerves as the amateur armour-pilot wilted beneath the attention. Finding his voice, the young man spoke with confused indignation.\n\n\"What? Why are you all looking at me?\" Half an hour later, the team waited expectantly in the VTOL as they approached the prison craft. The vessel was in 'stealth mode', hoping to infiltrate their target with minimal fuss, while their distraction did his job. The other members of the strike-force listened with sadistic smiles as Lawrence desperately tried to fight off the Zel'tan armada with very mixed results. Even within the confines of their transport, the team could hear the sounds of distant conflict. The cacophony brought the super-villains glee in a time of great stress, so Lawrence had completed his task two-fold. Pilot gently navigated through a fractured city-scape, gliding through the shattered skyline with an ease that belied the VTOL's frame. There was nothing about his demeanour that suggested this turn of events was out of the ordinary.\n\n\"We have arrived at the LZ. All passengers, please remember to dispose of any waste by jamming it down the nearest lizard trash can and to watch the drop. Please give your flight attendant a welcoming hand as he demonstrates the disembarking procedure. Barghast, you're up.\" Pilot delivered the phrase with the same chipper attitude one might expect of a stereotypical commercial airline pilot. Barghast growled threateningly but acquiesced and vanished through the cargo ramp with a shimmer. The mercenaries continued their preparations, checking holsters and doing last-minute checks on equipment. Kitsune smoothed his suit down, fiddling with his tie in an almost zealous manner. Across from him, Event Horizon finished draining the dregs from his grande-sized mug of coffee. The speedster was idly twirling his staff against the hull, a metallic clang echoing through the small vessel.\n\nTense seconds passed as the away team waited for Barghast. As expertly trained as the mercenaries were, they were not exempt from the air of unease; their bodies taut like wire pulled too tight. The five of them remained in shooting stances on the off-chance that something happened that bullets could actually affect. Seconds ticked by and even the typically implacable Event Horizon was beginning to sweat. After almost five minutes had passed, Kitsune cursed quietly and turned to tell Pilot that the operation was a failure. It was at this exact moment that Barghast reappeared, his ghoulish visage stained crimson as fresh viscera dripped from his maw.\n\n\"I have removed any resistance from this section of the vessel. There were far fewer than I had anticipated, though that is hardly a complaint.\" The shadow-walker shifted his attention to Event Horizon, extending one ooze-covered claw in his direction. \"The squirrel should proceed first. His speed is sufficient to find our prisoners without raising the alarm.\" Kitsune nodded his agreement and the speedster in question sighed. He gingerly accepted the proffered talon and shuddered at the sudden sensation of incorporealness. Minato's special forces watched with detached interest as the duo phased through the hull, knowing that they would all experience the same soon enough. Bargast returned for each of them in turn until only Kitsune remained. Minato paced within the crew compartment, trying to calm himself. The villain stopped his pacing at the sight of Barghast's shadowy form slowly rising through the hull.\n\n\"I'm ready. How do I look?\" Kitsune adjusted his tie with a determined expression, his tone conveying a confidence that he did not feel. Rotezhan observed his companion with an expression that may have been called respect before flicking gore free of his claws. The cannibalistic super-villain gently placed the now-clean appendage on Kitsune's shoulder and grinned. It did nothing to put Minato at ease until Barghast spoke.\n\n\"You look prepared. Let us unleash the hounds of war, my friend.\" The unlikely companions laughed and Minato closed his eyes, embracing the darkness that swallowed him whole. Time and reality lost meaning in the void that surrounded him, a place so devoid of life and colour that Kitsune very nearly lost his very sense of identity. For all he knew, a lifetime may have been passed him by in the scant moments he spent in that wretched place. Light exploded into existence, the sudden intensity burning Minato's eyes as he gasped for air. Barghast steadied him with one freakishly proportioned hand, the umbra-swathed beast displaying a disturbing amount of concern. \"My apologies, young fox. It inflicts a heavy toll on the human form to travel as I do. The asthenia will pass momentarily.\" Event Horizon appeared in a flurry of movement, his body-suit stained with Zel'tan ichor. \n\n\"Took out another dozen of the buggers. Haven't found the holding area yet but this ship really isn't as big as I thought it was. I've already covered half of the damn thing.\" The staff-wielder mused as he produced a dirty rag from somewhere and began cleaning off his weapon of choice. Minato finally managed to suck down a lungful of oxygen and, having regained some vague semblance of composure, surveyed the area. The strike force found themselves in a long corridor with walls of chitin and steel grating beneath their boots; barely recognisable Zel'tan corpses littered the hallways, each of them the victim of a savage mauling. The troopers were setting up a perimeter, silent and efficient. Barghast sniffed the air with animalistic fervour, his tongue dangling from between colossal jaws. Kitsune slowly righted himself and moved forward, stiffly but surely. He forced his voice to be firm, even as his body wavered.\n\n\"We can't count on them not realising we're here. Find whatever counts as their command centre and hit it hard. Event Horizon, Barghast...start us off.\" The diabolic duo smiled cruelly at each other before taking off at speed, Barghast shifting through walls to keep up with the speedster. Minato turned to his remaining henchmen and sighed. \"Alright, now we try to catch up and kill any of the left-overs.\" The freelancers nodded and moved in formation, with their commander firmly planted in the centre of their battle-star. Their pace was steady, stopping only at corners or to finish off ailing Zel'tan. This was hardly an easy task as, even dying, the reptilian soldiers could endure a prodigious amount of damage before finally expiring. Minato's Mercenaries were nothing if not persistent however and so they continued along the corridor in good time. The sounds of conflict grew louder, the hissing roar of flamethrowers echoing down the long hallways.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" The scene before Kitsune was not at all expected. A massive chamber lay before them, filled with a large platform stretched over a vast chasm. The scaffold was suspended by four thick cables at each corner, the metallic wires straining with effort. Barghast and Event Horizon were fighting a considerably larger force of Zel'tan than they had encountered before; dozens of saurian guards assaulting their position. Event Horizon was hunched behind a small pile of Zel'tan corpses, hiding from intense bursts of flame that rippled through the air while Barghast was being inundated with snarling foot soldiers. All in all, this was a significantly more capable defence than Kitsune had ever seen their foes erect. His response was pure indignation. \"You can't do that! They can't do that!\" He gesticulated wildly at the chaotic battleground before one of his troopers seized him by the shoulder.\n\n\"Sir! Do we engage or fallback?\" The mercenary shook Minato once to clear his head. The impromptu military commander took a growling breath before issuing his commands.\n\n\"Hit the flamers with heavy munitions and then take cover. I'm calling in some support.\" The soldiers engaged, unleashing a salvo of explosives on their unsuspecting enemies. Kitsune dove for cover beside Event Horizon and flashed him a wry grin before touching his communicator. The device sprung to life, Lawrence's panicked cries roaring over the line. \"Shut up. We need you here, now. Can the suit triangulate my position?\"\n\n\"It's not technically triangulating because you need three different signals to actually triangulate, which is where the 'tri' comes into it...\" The pilot let loose with a stream of anxious babble that was cut short with an angry snarl from Minato.\n\n\"Can you do it or not?\" There was a momentary pause before Lawrence whimpered an affirmative. \"Then do it.\" There was a thunderous crash as metal and chitin were rent asunder beneath a great weight moving at speed. Lawrence slammed into the platform amidst large amounts of falling debris, causing it to shudder violently from the impact. With the added firepower of the suit and the mercenaries, the tide quickly turned. Within minutes, there were piles of freshly slain Zel'tan lying in their own offal. The team was racing through the prison craft, slaughtering their way through the remaining crew with little effort. It surprised them how few of the aliens there really were, though it was hardly a concern for them. The Talons were attempting to dock but without anyone crewing the command deck, they were unable to enter the now closed hangers. It took little effort to locate the captives and even less to free them. They were being shepherded into a single location by Minato and his mercenaries when a pair of Zel'tan emerged from within a wall. \n\n\"Stop!\" It was simply reflex for Minato to bellow out the command, his words infused with the Voice. The crowd around him stilled immediately and Kitsune cursed violently, knowing that they would be solitary targets for the alien invaders. It took him several seconds without violence to realise that the Zel'tan had also lolled into an idle stance, their bodies slack and their eyes dull. The con artist stared at his docile saurians with a slowly growing smile. \"Oh yes. I think this will do nicely. The two of you will take me to any other Zel'tan on this vessel.\" The unlikely trio moved away and returned later with half a dozen other lizard-men following them. The other strike-force members were immediately on edge but Minato silenced them with a raised hand and a vicious smirk. \"Gentlemen, let me introduce you to the newest additions to our merry band. It appears that the Zel'tan are just as susceptible to my unique charms as everyone else.\" The group parted involuntarily to allow the hulking creatures entry.\n\n\"I mean...I guess we did need a way to transport folk out of here. They can fly the Talons, I guess?\" Event Horizon hesitantly put forward, glancing at Barghast for some support. None was forthcoming as the predatory villain eyed off the new meat with a hungry expression. Steeling himself, Event Horizon pushed forward. \"But how the fuck do we stop the Talons from nuking us as soon as we open the hanger?\" Minato answered, not with words but with a pointed look at the salivating Rotezhan. The speedster sighed and deflated, like a balloon struck with a pin. \"Yeah, okay. I almost feel bad for the bastards.\" The entire process took about twenty minutes as they opened the Hanger just enough for a pair of Talons to enter at a time. The docked vessels were a perfect target for Barghast; a smorgasbord of juicy extraterrestrial flesh that the shadow beast consumed with gusto. \n\n\"I think that went well, don't you?\" Kitsune enthused as the team returned, their VTOL flanked by several large Talons and Lawrence's battle-suit. Each was piloted by one of the controlled Zel'tan, their minds anchored to the will of Kitsune. \"Alright everybody, deliver the humans to their dwelling and then return to us at the Museum. We'll be waiting.\" His words were sing-song into the communicator but the Talons peeled off as one. He grinned at Event Horizon and wiggled his eyes, evoking a shake of the head from his friend.\n\n\"Hope you know what you're doing with those things. Can't afford a misstep here.\" Event Horizon, in an extremely rare occasion of wisdom, tried to caution the con-man. Kitsune rolled his eyes in exasperation but restrained his glee with practised ease. \"I mean, alien army is awesome and all but let's focus on the big picture.\" \n\n\"I know, I know. You're right. I suppose it was just nice learning that I'm not useless in a fight now.\" Minato admitted with a sheepish smile. Barghast chuckled next to him and Event Horizon laughed openly. \"Alright, alright. Yuck it up.\" There was an atmosphere of comradery between the super-villains now. They had fought together, bled together and suffered through the idiocy of Lawrence together. As the VTOL touched down, Kitsune genuinely believed that the team might actually be able to pull this off. Sarge appeared at the foot of the ramp to meet them, presenting a list of the updated supplies. \n\n\"Good news, sir. Between your salvaging expedition and a few lucky finds, we have enough resources to keep our operation going for some time.\" Kitsune clapped Sarge on the shoulder and led the mercenary commander away from the group as they spoke.\n\n\"Fantastic. I've got a few questions for you, if you don't mind?\" Sarge was immediately suspicious but allowed himself to be directed away. Once they had found a quiet corner to themselves, Kitsune grinned disarmingly. \"We don't really know that much about each other, Sarge. I don't even know your real name. All I know is that you're very good at what you do and you're very loyal to the mission...or is it loyal to Pinnacle?\" He watched for any sign of reaction from the paramilitary agent. Sarge remained silent, his face hidden behind the helmet. \"You know what I find interesting? A vessel as large as the prison ship had less than a hundred crew onboard. That even the basic foot soldiers for an alien species understand English. That someone as smart as Pinnacle would send three strangers along with a mercenary crew to liberate somewhere as important as New York City. Don't you find that interesting?\" They stared at each other for a long moment before Minato clapped his hands together suddenly, the motion provoking Sarge to draw his pistol with blinding speed and aim at the charismatic leader\n\n\"I knew that it would be you who figured it out. I was just hoping to have a little more time.\" Sarge retained his professional tone, unconcerned by the revelation. Kitsune shrugged with a light laugh.\n\n\"I only have suspicions, of course. There's no real evidence that I can find. Well, except for you.\" The military commander cocked his head, the first sign of confusion that Minato had seen in their interactions. \"Did you know that I can converse with the dead? One of my less known abilities but it certainly has it's uses. For instance, I can command them to possess someone.\" Sarge seized up suddenly, his body convulsing madly. \"Once I have a spirit inside someone, I can sift through their memories. That's what is happening now, Reginald. I can see why you prefer 'Sarge'.\" The Japanese-American man chuckled once, gently disarming his victim. \"Now then, let's get to the bottom of things.\" \n\nMinato closed his eyes and focused, entreating the spirit to bond with him. There was a cool, welcoming touch across the astral tether between them and he was suddenly elsewhere. His vision was tinted red by Sarge's visor but Kitsune recognised Pinnacle standing before him. Dozens of unit leaders stood at attention as Pinnacle instructed them to work with the villains until such a time as they were no longer necessary. The Zel'tan were nothing but genetically augmented lizards, created by Pinnacle to present the world with a credible threat so that he could liberate Earth and become the saviour of humanity. Large, liquid filled tanks were wheeled past as he spoke; filled with the unconscious, cloned forms of Earth's greatest heroes after they had met their demise at Pinnacle's hands.\n\nA tank carrying the form of River Fox passed his sight and Minato's rage shattered his focus. The connection with his spirit was severed violently, forcing the medium to his knees from the psychic backlash. The pain was potent enough to blur his vision but Minato was coherent enough to recognise Sarge standing over him. The mercenary placed the barrel of his pistol against Kitsune's forehead with one hand, removing his helemt with the other. The man was quite bland, his features weathered but well-groomed. Minato glared up at his executioner, his furious eyes locked with Sarge's cold gaze. \n\n\"You better not miss, you piece of shit.\"",

        "text": "So lords &amp; ladies today I would like unveil a tale of my own, taken from the adventures of a tabletop group I had the pleasure of running with in my high school years. Now before I begin I'd like to go ahead and say that my memory of the event in question is slightly fuzzy and as such if anyone from that group sees this they are free to add in where ever they see fit. Moving on to the major movers and shakers of this particular tale, we had Teratal Lorearthan our resident evil mage &amp; my not yet corrupted monk Dayman Snow (bonus points if you get their names references.) All of which takes place within a module for 3.5 in The Forgotten Realms setting, from which the party is tasked with reclaiming/restoring proper order to The Dales. Our group based ourselves there in one of the conquered tower way back before I had joined the gamin scene, our guild/organization was called The Six Silver Eclipse and this was their main conculsion (for the time anyways.) Alas without further ado I present to you all, by u/TrollKitten request, the story of how my human monk drop kicked a dragon out of the sky.\n\nIt all began around the early-middle of the module, the party had just successfully aided the local druids circle in defending themselves from the Zhentarim invaders stealthfully. Through much luck and mighty a spell flung from our evil mage the day was won in our favor. After some healing and accompanied cursing later, our party's druid and member of the local circle was able to negotiate us some aerial support. The reason behind this was from our previous silent scouting of the enemy occupied base and the town under martial law, we'd see signs of sky support. In turn we got our own in the form of about ten to twenty Pegasus, enough for a good portion of our mages and bowmen to offer good enough assistance for our main forces. The only flaw in our plan was that the rides would only follow the druid lended to them and they refused to lift good ol' Teratal due to the sense of  wickedness or something along those lines coming off him. Debating it over a few hours (in game) we came to the result that Dayman, the druid and Teratal (with his own flight spell) would lead the aerial charge on the fateful conflict approaching.\n\nOur second problem was that the party was basically duped of all magical swag at the time due to hi-jinks and our base being stolen. Taking this as our next course of action we started then gaining/spending favors through the revolt higher ups to assist us in if not retrieving our gear then at least equipping us well enough to handle the big players. Note that from this Dayman (my pc) basically got gimped from this since the adventure &amp; DM really didn't have anything geared towards the class or that wasn't already claimed/rolled for. So eventually he was simply asked by a powerful NPC what he would like as reward, the first was a mask of flight so that he could permanently gain an advantage in mobility and his second was turned down (idek what it was anymore) but in return he was given a custom homebrewed headband. Now a moment of your time to explain what exactly this headband was suppose to do and what I eventually did with it.\n\nAny of you old school arcane monkeys recall the game of our generation... something kewl called MORTAL KOMBAT! Well my DM at the time thought it'd be real funny to have the headband have me do [basically this.](http://tabmok99.mortalkombatonline.com/liu_kangs_flying_kick_fatality.gif)  but with more flames. To top it off they made it a skill check to see how much damage could be inflicted at the time and since it was based around jump (a skill I had honestly been dumping extra points into resulting in me jumping as if I was an extra in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.) To balance everything out though this would hurt me as well since ya know hidden stop after high momentum and all that laws of universe stuff. Armed with this Dayman learned one of the most powerful techniques that Forgotten Realms has ever heard of, more on that later.\n\nMinutes turned to hours before hours turned to days of planning our assault on our old stomping grounds before we bore much fruit on the day of the revolt. One of our players, who we'll call Tom(you know who you are!), had rolled up this strange pc that could transform himself into huge creatures through whatever book or splat he pulled that from. Why do I mention this, well it was decided upon (last minute mind you) that this... thing would join the aerial assault aka my branch of the attack. Moving along it was the morn of the day, our troops lead by the druid (name started with an S IIRC) lead the main force while being accompanied by Tom who chose to become a huge metallic dragon for this (without the awesome stats mind you, just the size/breath weapon.) While Teratal with Dayman would be flying up higher then the rest of the legion with the sun directly behind their backs, Dayman acting mainly as support for the mage who really didn't need it IIRC as everyone readied themselves. When all of our hearts fell (maybe not Teratals', still out if he even has that thing still) at the sight before us, not only had the enemy risen their own flying armada but at the spear point was a massive black dragon being rode by a high circle necromancer!\n\nSwiftly with the speed that only years of mastering martial arts and punching horrors from all the realms could produce, Dayman told the mage &amp; the forces below to continue on as planned. He would solo the dragon... at which point with the mask of flight in combination to the boots of speed allowed him to rose higher and higher into the sky till he was about a thousand feet above the forces below in mere seconds.\n\nThat was the moment I dropped the bomb on my DM, Dayman called out \"BLACK METEOR LOTUS TECHNIQUE!\" before activating his headband and aiming this missile of death at the dragon/rider. With the amused quizzical look that only he could give me at that moment he replies [\"Roll to hit &amp; Jump with +10; surprise, higher ground and pure WTF are the factors in your favor here.\"](https://i0.wp.com/i63.tinypic.com/34njl82.jpg) The dice fell from my well shook hand... everyones' breath at the table was still... 19! [\"That's a hit!](http://www.gameinformer.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Discussions-Components-Files/14492/6332.jackass-dropkick-to-head-referee-gif.gif) With a thunderous roar of slightly breaking the sound barrier, Dayman became a red star in the morning light as the necromancer became chunky salsa while also smacking the overgrown lizard beneath him. Amazingly the dragon as well as Dayman both survived this explosion of awesome with just under half health. Having succeeded in surprising the ever living piss out of the enemy as the dragon plummeted unto the ground below in addition to all this. With a look I was told was of pure conviction or full blown tard-ness I said \"Dayman does it again.\" A flick of the wrist later, the die had been cast and with it I pressed lady luck for one more kiss that night. \n\n**[Natural 20.](http://starryskies.com/leonids/target01.jpg)**\n\n*There are rumors and whispers of man whose fate was tested not by fate or by divine up above but instead by himself. It is said that he once took on the child of a fallen enemy knowing her maturity would come upon his possible doom, though he did not care as it was the just thing to do. It was also said that he was stricken down by a thousand lightning strikes only to rise the following day reborn anew while still as humble a fellow as ever. Why there was even a spun tale of him out-smoking both Elf and dwarf alike, if you can believe it?!* I digress, it was on that bright rebellious day a man stood in the center of a dragons corpse soaked in its blood alive and STANDING no less. Legends were told, greatness was inspired, though not a soul truly knew was he stood unconscious at zero hit points.\n\nAfter that display, ours were victorious from enemy lose on confidence to which we accompanied by furious righteousness... plus some good rolls or two. In the end we beat the baddies and our groups leader became mayor of our town, even opened up his own adventurers tavern/inn.\n\nThere ya have it, the short and sweet of how a human monk stood more mighty than a evil draconic beast. GG folks and may your tales ever bring you fortunes well given. ",

        "text": "I was playing EverQuest when I was a young boy, so I don't remember all of the specific names of places and abilities, but I’ll do my best. Some of this info might be a little inaccurate – so all of you EverQuest junkies don’t slit my throat. This is how the events happened based on the memory of a 9 year old. It’s very possible that when I say 5 hours it may have been much shorter than that due to how we perceive time differently depending on our age, but I don’t believe I’m too far off in anything I say here. When there is a possible discrepancy in the story, I make note of it.\n\nThe tale starts with my level 18 Dwarf, Dorim. I was leveling in a new environment but there were a lot of high level mobs in the area. It was some island in the Kunark expansion IIRC (Firiona Vie?). It was good exp, but it was very intimidating for a young boy like me (who was only about 9 or so years old at the time). Everquest was an unforgiving game, so for a 9 year old it wasn’t a great idea to take huge risks even if the reward was great. My step-dad insisted I level here, but I simply felt more comfortable back in the Oasis. The only reason I was here to begin with was due to his advice. I was definitely more comfortable in my old leveling environment.\n\nI told my father I’d be traveling back to the oasis. Now for all of you who don’t know, traveling to different zones and islands in Everquest was quite a large commitment. It was a venture that could take hours depending on where you were going, and a lot of the time you’d have to run through dangerous and difficult areas to get where you needed to be. Of course if you died, you’d spawn back to wherever you were “binded”. Getting someone to bind you at a new location was difficult, time consuming, and expensive, and if you died you’d be far away from your corpse which would have all of your items on it (the death penalty in EQ was brutal). Needless to say, dying was not an option and traveling was risky. My step-dad hated the idea. I told him I’d just ask a player to teleport me there. This seems like an obvious decision, but only certain classes had this spell and it took a lot of mana. Getting mana back in Everquest was quite a long and boring process, so people charged an arm and a leg to teleport players. For a low level player like myself, this would cost me a fortune. I should note that my father was a max level Druid and had the spell to do this himself. He also had a ton of expendable income and it would have been easy for him to provide me the funds to do this. However, not only did he say he wouldn’t help me out but he forced me against my will to take the dangerous trek to the Oasis without a teleport. I was fine with paying, but he didn’t let me.\n\nTo get from island to island, usually you’d have to take a boat. Boats would come maybe once every 30 minutes to an hour depending on the dock. After waiting for an extended period of time, the boat finally arrived. I walked onto the dock and up the ramp that was attached to the boat. However, any EverQuest player will tell you the horrors of riding these boats. Boats were glitchy as fuck and routinely people would fall off of them into the water – especially when changing zones. However, I wasn’t even that lucky as I just fell through the boat floor as soon as I tried to get on. Here’s where things get REALLY messy. I looked all over the place and I could not find anywhere to get back onto land. The only way of getting onto the island that I knew about was to ride the boat to the dock. I couldn’t simply get onto land from the ocean; it was impossible. Even if I did happen to find a spot with a beach (which I couldn’t) it would likely be guarded by high level mobs and I would meet my untimely demise. This was not an attractive option. My step-dad suggested I swim to the Oasis – my destination. I levy that if there was a safe place to get back onto land, I didn’t know of it nor did my max level father. It was his idea for me to swim. Being an impressionable 9 years old, I listen to my dad once again.\n\nThere were a multitude of problems with this. First of all, the oceans in EverQuest are fucking VAST and the island I was going to was far away. Not only that, but EQ had a swimming skill and those who failed to level it up would swim EXTREMELY slowly. Seeing as how people almost never touched the water, most people’s swimming ability was garbage. Being a low level 18, that went doubly for me. I checked my swimming level – it was at 2… The second problem was that EverQuest did not provide you with a map back then. I had to swim to the location almost purely on instinct. The only real indication I had was a command prompt that would give me my X,Y coordinates so I knew a general direction that I was headed. Aside from that, I was swimming blind in the vast ocean. The only upside is I could swim forever without drowning as long as I didn’t go underwater. The third problem with swimming is that the ocean was known for having sharks and other decently high leveled mobs in it. If you died in the ocean, you were FUCKED. Good luck retrieving that corpse after dying in the middle of nowhere before it rots and you lose ALL OF YOUR ITEMS. How the hell could you even find it? There were also rumors of krakens and other sea monsters, which were deemed to be mostly untrue but back in the day we had no way to know. The internet was still in its infancy and EQ even to this day has a lot of mysteries of that nature. It’s a tough game to figure out even with data mining. As a 9 year old I was terrified.\n\nSo I started swimming… after literally hours upon hours of swimming (if my memory serves me correctly, it was 5 hours) I went from like 2 to 40 in my swimming ability and I hit an island near my destination. Due to the scariness of the ocean, I was basically hyperventilating the entire time. Luckily, I did not encounter any sharks. One more thing of note, you could not go to a different zone in the ocean unless you were on a boat, so I had to stop at a different island to board a boat to make it to my destination. Of course I only got to this island after my hours upon hours of swimming… Here was my next big problem, this island has some crazy high levels mobs compared to me. It had a ton of ogres that would kill me on sight and I’d have no chance of beating them. Absolutely none. I had to strategically make my way onto land and sneak to the docks without being noticed by them. Luckily, this island (unlike the one I came from) actually allowed me to get onto land from the sea because it had beaches everywhere. Like I said before, boats take awhile to arrive, so I sat around for 30 minutes or so hoping to god that no monsters would randomly walk towards me and kill me.\n\nAfter a solid 30 minutes of waiting, I saw the boat coming from the distance (this time, it was a simple raft instead of the decorated boat I attempted to board before). I was teething with joy. Once I got on this boat, I’d only be a short 10 minute ride from my destination – the Oasis. As I was jumping up and down with excitement, I heard my character grunt. I looked down at the chat log and saw I was being attacked by an ogre. Panicking, I checked my HP – I was already at half HP and it was going down FAST. I didn’t have many options here. I could try to run, but mobs in this game will chase you to the end of the Earth and I would only serve to attract more attention by doing so. Plus, I would probably die instantly if I turned my back on this opponent. I decided I would try to fight it. I realized it’d be impossible, but I had to try…\n\nI started attacking the ogre, doing pitiful damage. After a few short seconds of fighting, I was already down to about 10% health. I was a Paladin which meant I had an ability called “Lay on Hands”. It could only be used once per day (I forget if it was in-game time or real life time, but even an in-game day was extremely lengthy so this isn’t something I could spam). Lay on Hands would instantly heal you to full health, no matter what. I used the ability and my health shot up. I kept attacking and just trying my best to win this fight, but it was no use… my health got to less than 20%. All hope was lost. I had fallen into the ocean and swam for 5 hours, snuck onto the ogre island and found my way to the docks… All for nothing…\n\nBut then I saw a wolf in the distance. It was running towards me; it started attacking the ogre! The wolf had a player name above it… it was a player! Druids had a spell where they could into wolves. A high level player saw that I was having difficulty and came over to save me! The ogre got a few more hits on me before he turned his attention to the Druid. I checked my HP – 5% left. The Druid’s mad dash to help me also attracted the attention of the entire ogre camp. He was fighting nearly 10 ogres alone. Even though he was a high level, he still had a tough time with this. However, he eventually managed to defeat them all. I said thank you and offered some money to show my gratitude (money I could’ve used to just be teleported to the stupid Oasis in the first place) he declined and went off on his way.\n \nI was extremely happy to have survived, but in my elation I had forgotten something… the raft! I was safe for now, but if I missed the raft it definitely wouldn’t be back before the ogres respawned. I turned around and the raft was still there. Upon docking, boats stick around for a few minutes, but they will leave whether you’re on them or not. I rushed towards the raft as fast as I could and tried to get on. I couldn’t… I tried my hardest to get on for a solid 30 seconds. For whatever reason, the geometry of the raft was preventing me from boarding. I got frustrated and started mashing the keyboard. The raft started to float away. As this happened, magically I appeared on top of the raft. Latency issues? Either way, I was on the raft and I was safe. All I had to do was sit still for 10 minutes and let the raft take me to my destination – the Oasis.\n\nAfter a short boat ride I finally made it to the Oasis. Ah, I was here at last. My step-dad came into the room right as I docked. I told him my tale and the proud achievement of me making it here. He was only half listening as he read my chat log. “Your character is hungry” he said. “Oh. That’s no big deal, I’ll just go buy food and water at Freeport. I need to change my binding anyway”. Now that I had arrived at my destination, I needed to change my binding – which is where I would respawn upon dying. If I were to die now, I’d appear all the way back at where I started this journey. The Oasis was a good place for leveling, but it was much safer to bind in the next town over – Freeport. I start walking that way and my step father stopped me. “Your character is REALLY hungry. Thirsty too. Just go ahead and buy some food at the tent vendors over there. Then you can go to Freeport and bind afterwards”. I told him it’s stupid and dangerous, and after this long journey (which is primarily his fault for not helping me and forcing me to take the boat instead of buying a teleport) I didn’t want to risk anything at this point. Once again, he convinced me to do something against my will. I headed towards the tents to buy some food.\n\nThe Oasis was a relatively safe place for my level, but like a lot of zones (including the one I traveled from) it did have some high level mobs spread throughout the zone. Specifically, the Sand Giants and the specters. The specters weren’t a big problem because they were in a tower in the middle of a lake. Usually you’d only fight them if you sought them out, but occasionally someone would go there, get their ass kicked, and run back to the main land before they could die in the specter tower. In these cases, there would be a high level specter walking around that would kill low level players like myself until a high level player came along and cleared it out. The other high level mobs were Sand giants. These were much easier to randomly encounter than specters because they were on the main land, but they were huge so they were easy to see coming, and they generally only stayed around a certain area – though every once in awhile they would roam to the docks. There were normal giants, and there was also a boss of the sand giants (Cazel). He was much stronger than the regular sand giants.\n\nNow that I’ve got those facts out of the way – as I was saying: my father convinced me to buy food and water in the Oasis tents. This normally wasn’t too dangerous, but like I said I just wanted to be as safe as possible and bind before anything bad happened. I went over to the tents and started buying food and water. As I was shopping, I heard my character grunt. “ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?!” I looked at my chat log and saw that I was being hit. My father was still watching me over my shoulder. “Fight back!” He said. I clicked out of the store menu and I saw one of the store vendors was attacking me. In this game, random npcs could attack you depending on certain mobs you had killed or even depending on your race or the god you worshiped. It was an intricate faction system and for whatever reason, this human npc had a problem with me and started attacking me on sight. For normal people it wouldn’t be a problem, but clearly I had done something in the past that pissed him off. \n\nFortunately, he was about the same level as me so I could hold my own. It’s worth noting that I didn’t have my Lay on Hands spell any more (because I had used it earlier against the ogres) so I couldn’t use that as a crutch. I fended him off without too much trouble and he started running away before I could land the final blow. I decide I’d had just about enough of this place and said to my step-dad I’m heading to Free Port now. “You need to go finish him off. You don’t want him to chase you down and attack you later” my father said. As unlikely as this was, it was still possible. This time it wasn’t too difficult to convince me because I was so afraid of dying and panicked at the thought of him chasing me down. I knew I could finish him off, so I chased him. \n\nI only followed him for about 10 seconds when suddenly…. disaster struck. There was a part of this map that people called “Orc Highway” because it had an insanely dense amount of orcs. It was a great spot to farm, but you could easily mess up and end up fighting more orcs than you bargained for. This meant a lot of groups would wipe. Unfortunately for me, that happened as I was chasing this npc. A group wiped and that meant there were tons of pissed off and angry orcs closer to the tents than they would normally be. They saw me and 10 or so orcs came rushing. This would be difficult for a group of 6 people my level to clear, and without Lay on Hands it would be hard to survive this. I saw them coming and decided running was my only option (and it wasn’t even that likely to work). I turn around and instantly I see hell…. A sand giant. Not just any sand giant, but the BOSS sand giant who was a rare spawn and I had NEVER seen him before. “Fuck me. How unlucky can I possibly get?!”. I didn’t know if it saw me, but it certainly was close enough to agro and I knew 1 or 2 hits from that thing alone would take me down even at full health, and I still wasn’t healed from my fight with the human NPC. I turned in a different direction. I now had a human npc that I had been in the middle of fighting and could come attack me again at any time, 10 orcs that would be reasonably difficult to fight 1 vs. 1, and the boss Sand Giant all potentially aggro’d on to me. But still I had hope… maybe, just MAYBE I could make it to the docks before the sand giant or the orcs killed me. \n\nAt the docks were guards and high level players. If I pulled them there, it was possible they could save me like the druid from earlier did. I turned to face the docks. I saw them in the distance with tons of players hanging out. In my elation, the only thing I could see were the docks in front of me. I was completely tunnel visioned. But then I saw something else… I didn’t know the TRUE meaning of bad luck… because in front of my path to the docks was a specter! Having fought and leveled in the Oasis for a long time before this, I had only ever seen a specter once. Like I said, it’s very rare to see them unless you actually go fuck with them in their tower, and very rarely does anyone ever pull one all the way to the main land. Specters were even stronger than the sand giants. I was truly fucked in every sense of the word. I couldn’t move forward or else the specter would kill me. I couldn’t go to my left, right, or behind me because of the orcs, boss sand giant, and human npc. I was surrounded. The specter floated towards me. I turned around. The sand giant WAS aggroed onto me after all. In the distance I saw the orcs gaining on me. At this point I accepted my fate. All at once the specter, sand giant, and orcs dog piled me. I believe the first one to hit me was the boss sand giant, who one-shotted me. After all of my terrible luck, hard fights, and time spent getting here – I had died…\n\nI respawned without any items back on the island where I had begun my day roughly 6 hours prior. Now I was in a zone that I didn’t want to be in, and my corpse with all of my items and money was far away. If I couldn’t get back to it in time, I’d lose all of my money and items. That was the cruelty of EQ’s death penalty. Now I couldn’t even pay for a teleport if I wanted to, because my money was on my dead body. I was truly fucked. I complained to my step-dad, because this entire thing was his fault. He didn’t teleport me or give me money. He told me I wasn’t allowed to spend money on the teleport. He told me to swim to the Oasis. He told me to buy food and water in the oasis. He told me to chase the human NPC instead of running. Hell the only reason I had left the Oasis originally was due to his advice! This was 100% on him. “Okay. Let me log onto my druid and teleport you to the oasis” he said.\n\n“………………” I was speechless. “Are you serious…?”\n“Of course! :)”\n“You could’ve done that this entire time…”\n\nSo he logged onto his druid (he had a separate account which made this possible) dragged my body to a safe location in the Oasis and teleported me to it. I looted my corpse and then headed to Freeport to bind myself. In the following weeks, I tried to level up in the Oasis. It was slow and really wasn’t the ideal place for my character. I quit playing the game soon after.\n",

        "text": "[Ling Ling the monkey girl](http://i.imgur.com/2SwMf0l.png) [could not see in the dark](https://redd.it/4jo9rv). In her haste to be an interesting and dynamic character, she'd left out one rather important racial feature: Low-light vision. The ability seemed to be handed out to every living creature, their dogs, and all the dogs' fleas, but not, alas, to the monkey-like Vanaras.\n\nThis was upsetting, because Ling Ling was in a deep underground facility in complete blackness. And, seeing as she was not a spelunker or a wizard, she had absolutely no sources of illumination. Oh yeah. And she was afraid of the dark. It was a deep childhood fear, followed closely by the fear of isolation.\n\nSuffice it to say, Ling Ling was not having a good day.\n\nScrabbling around, looking for something, ANYTHING to help her out of her situation, her hand bumped into a small pack that had been left behind by her captor. She tore it open, and scrabbled at the contents- a few weak torches, some rations, some water, and a flimsy little booklet. Desperate for light and information, she lit the torch, and examined the booklet's title. With cheerful and cartoony art and big, colorful lettering, it read:\n\n***So you're a political prisoner!*** **Activities, advice, and encouragement for those locked away by unfortunate circumstances.** *Quit worrying and enjoy your incarceration!*\n\nLing Ling promised a painful death to both the person who wrote the damned booklet, and the malevolent doppelganger that had taken her place and forced her into this mess. Gods only knew what her violent and irresponsible \"comrades\" would get up to without the guidance of someone who understood the terms \"collateral damage\" and \"restraint\". The thought made her shudder. [Loki, that smarmy half-elf bastard](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png), would probably cheerfully do anything that paid well. [Jello Shot the magic slime](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif) would seize every opportunity to devour things. And Krag the orcish fighter... probably just wanted to hit things.\n\nThis could only end in disaster.\n\n------\n\nMEANWHILE.\n\nDoppelganger Ling Ling: \"Hey guys! Just picked up a new mission that pays well, and we won't have to worry about collateral damage or restraint-\"\n\nJello Shot: \"DOPPELGANGER! KILL IT!\"\n\n***/VIOLENCE***\n\nThree hours later, the party had tracked down Ling Ling and freed her from her horrible isolation.\n\nAnd that's when things *really* went to shit.\n\nAs the party rushed in to the old, seemingly abandoned facility where Ling Ling had been a prisoner, something followed them. Something malevolent, powerful, and insufferably smug. As the party piled in to rescue their totally-not-mom, someone froze the entire cavern behind them, cutting off their escape with a wall of ice.\n\nAnd then he started humming.\n\n*You are my sunshine, my only sunshine...*\n\nWith that, the party went into full spook mode. Their exit was cut off, they had no plan of escape, and they had been busted up a bit getting here to rescue Ling Ling. Even Krag, whose prowess in combat was monstrous, had been a *little* impaled earlier by some sort of soul-stealing goat thing, which hadn't bothered him at the time, but in retrospect was not going to do him any favors against whatever hit next. And, as the party discovered, the thing that they were up against next was something powerful, well-equipped to attack at a range, and, most insidiously, attacked its victims' touch AC.\n\n***MAXIMUM SPOOK***\n\nThe party desperately ran through their options. Loki tried talking things out, and took a blast of ice directly to the throat. Krag tried VIOLENCE, but the target of VIOLENCE was out of reach. Jello Shot attempted to spell his way through things, but even he couldn't affect a target he couldn't see. And seeing as the only way out of this place was directly through an icy tunnel which their mystery opponent controlled, they had only one option.\n\nWhich was to fort up in the horrible facility that Ling Ling had been trapped in, barricade the door, tear open a dimensional rift, and NOPE the NOPE out of NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE\n\nApparently their mystery opponent did not expect this particular tactic, and was quite enraged. And as Krag and Loki barred the door, their opponent finally showed himself: A pale humanoid creature with ice jutting from his every feature, weilding twin guns covered with frost and terrible enchantments. Not nearly as intimidating as his ghost routine led them to believe, but there was still plenty to be scared of- it turns out that he was an amalgamation of hundreds of dead human souls *[that the party had previously murdered with wild abandon](https://redd.it/4fri37)*, which had then overpowered and mind-raped a [gun-wielding Lich, who was both Pale and a Stranger](https://redd.it/4hr41e). All in all, the thing may not have been terribly physically imposing, but he was still Bad News. And, oh yeah, he could tunnel through solid stone, right beneath the doors that the party had just slammed shut and locked. Whoops.\n\nThe party retreated, trying desperately to open the portal to another plane, but the icy lich just kept coming, occasionally being slowed down by traps or by showering unlucky targets with absolute storms of bullets. It was not looking good- but Krag wouldn't have any of it. He charged that icy fucker, hit him with his axe even as he took a storm of bullets to the gut, and used every last ounce of his stubborn orcish anger to chop the lich into tiny pieces. His efforts, surprisingly, worked well- except for the fact that he now was at -5 HP, bleeding profusely, and his opponent was only temporarily inconvenienced.\n\nThe lich attempted a retreat from the melee monster, so that he could take on other targets while Krag bled out and died. Krag was NOT HAVING IT, and followed behind the lich and into his tunnels, grabbing the icy fucker by the leg, freezing his hand in the process. The lich, frustrated, turned on Krag and leveled his guns at point-blank range. He couldn't possibly miss. He fired, and-\n\nAnd the bullet hit [Nibbet, the Murderous Dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/EyuHkT8.png) who was horribly disassembled but still had an all-important Curse laid on him that attracted attacks like a big, stupid magnet. He was brought in by [Villar, Ling Ling's totally-not-except-maybe-boyfriend](http://i.imgur.com/ayTt2xu.png), who had covertly tracked the party (by the trail of slime and bodies) and now threw himself into the conflict, dead-set on helping out however he could. And, as luck would have it, that was exactly when Ling Ling and Jello Shot managed to tear open the portal and provide an escape. The name of the game now was RUN LIKE HELL BEFORE WE'RE ALL SHOT TO DEATH.\n\nJello Shot stood guard, protecting the retreat! Loki immediately threw himself through the portal, trailing one last stream of bombs and traps, and Ling Ling was very determined NOT to leave anyone behind with this icy dickass Lich. She and Villar dove for Krag, who was still underground, trying furiously to use his giant fucking sword while bleeding out, being frozen over, and trapped three feet underground in confined quarters where his weapons were useless. He was pulled out amidst a scream of rage, hurled through the portal and given a goodnight smack to the face in order to stop his melodramatic self-sacrificing bullshit, and at that exact moment, the Icy Lich erupted from the ground to freeze Jello Shot with his unearthly cold hands.\n\nNow, Jello Shot had prepared for this by shifting around his elemental immunities and was prepared for Cold damage. What he was NOT prepared for was a pissed-off lich using his Paralysis touch and then capitalizing on it to drain his victim's soul. But Jello Shot burned a Magus Arcana point to get the upper hand on the fortitude save, wrenched free of the Paralysis, and hurled himself, along with Ling Ling, Villar, Nibbit, and the Lich, through the gaping portal. Which was totally not the plan. Because now the escape attempt had the fatal flaw of bringing the fanatically murderous Lich with the guns, the ice powers, and the extremely personal grudge THROUGH their hasty escape route and were now stuck with him in the middle of... a strange, high-flying airship. Which was good enough for Jello Shot, who burned enough Magus Arcana to supercharge his grappling power, and bodily hurl the bastard Lich over the railing and into the clouds beneath.\n\nThe Lich, who had ludicrously deadly and accurate guns of ice, the power to freeze anything, the power to drain souls, the power to tunnel through solid stone, the power to call the spirits to his command, the power to utterly end anyone who stood up to him, did not have the power that he desperately needed at this very moment. The power of flight. The ability seemed to be handed out to every evil villain and their dread dogs, and their dread dogs' malevolent death-fleas, but not, alas, to undead gunslingers.\n\nThis was upsetting, becaus the Lich was currently dropping over the edge of an airship hundreds of miles above the surface of the strange, barren planet below. But not for the party, who thought it was fucking hilarious.\n\nThe hilarity died when they realized that the curiously high-up airship was occupied. Occupied, in fact, by dozens or even hundreds of graceful, armed, and dangerous elves. Specifically, Faery elves. You know, the kind that the party had recently brought a big honking world of hurt onto, foiling their plans, spitting in their faces, murdering their agents, and calling them fat. And all of these elves had their attention and weapons trained directly on the party. The tired, low-on-health, out-of-spells and out-of-tricks party.\n\nThis could only end well.",

We found out he had apparently lost his sacred dragon mask and traveled to a prophet king's tomb/temple to possibly divine its location.\n\nNot minutes after arriving we found ourselves nearly crushed by a cave-in of the temple's main passageway, assaulted by a chimera constructed of tiles, all but 2 of us sucked into a giant whirling ball of bladed skeletons then smashed into a wall, and attacked by ghosts when our Arcane Trickster attempted to loot an ancient bed chamber.\n\nAlready battered, bruised, and a decent bit frustrated we arrive at a large open chamber with an empty basin near the far wall. Closer investigation reveals a channel leading from the wall to the basin.\n\nOur Arcane Trickster and Barbarian remembered that they had found a well and similar empty channel near the entrance, and figure it must be used to fill the basin. \n\nOne thing leads to another and they finally convince the rest of the party to see what happens when the basin is filled. We are on the other side of the main passageway from before, so Arcane Trickster and I  pass back to the other side using dimension door to avoid a lot of perilous back tracking.\n\nWe saunter up to the well and channel, and begin working together to pour enough water fill the basin. Glad to finally do something not immediately met with peril we start humming as we work. Nothing happens and, after talking with our Arcane Trickster on the many reasons why it is not a good idea to relieve oneself into a possibly mystical pool of water, we dimension door back to the group where everything is fine.\n\nAnd by fine I mean in complete and utter chaos.\n\nThe basin is now filled with an evil looking black flame, our Assassin and Sorceress are babbling in gibberish staring wide eyed into the dark fire, and our Ranger is standing on the other side of the room looking both simultaneously annoyed and intrigued at the recent turn of events.\n\nOh, and our Barbarian has sat his equipment off to the side and is about to dive into the flames.\n\nArcane Trickster and I manage to catch Barbarian off guard and tackle him to the ground away from the fire, where he struggles to get us off of him. I ask him what in the world he was doing and he enlightens us on what happened while we were jamming out by the well.\n\nApparently the moment water landed in the basin black flame burst forth driving our Sorceress and Assassin completely insane. Barbarian had tried his hardest to snap them out of it with no avail, then the voices started in his brain. A dark powerful voice from within his mind demanded tribute to the flame in return for knowledge.\n\nSeeing that violence, intimidation, and booze weren't the answer to this problem our normally selfish, angry, sadistic Barbarian had decided he would sacrifice himself if it would save some of the only people he actually cared about besides himself and help us in our quest to stop the cult.\n\nI then decided to enlighten him on the many reasons why its not a good idea to immediately KILL YOURSELF at the behest of a possibly evil voice in your head. Especially since tribute might not mean wholesale sacrifice in the first place. \n\nThe sane members of the party proceeded to knock out Sorceress, bind and gag Assassin, and toss varying items into the flame to see what would qualify as tribute including: gold, silver, beast fangs, and a cheese wheel.\n\nWith no response from any of it, we decided to try a small blood tribute. Our ranger pricked her thumb and let a droplet fall into the flames, which surged forth before settling down again seemingly unsatisfied. Upon seeing the response though, Barbarian asked if he could borrow my spare daggers since he had an idea. After him assuring me it wouldn't be anything to kill him I gave him the daggers against my better judgement.\n\nI immediately regretted that decision when he ran up and STABBED HIS WRISTS and let a decent amount of blood flow into the flames. The fire seemingly satisfied Barbarian listened to something only he could hear and responded by asking for the location of the missing dragon mask.\n\nStill losing blood and already pale as a ghost, Barbarian slipped to the ground, smiled at me and said \"See, now all you gotta do is heal me.\" matter of factly.\n\nI responded by letting him know he was an idiot because I had already USED UP my magic.\n\n\"Wait what?\", was all he managed before his eyes suddenly rolled back into his head and he fell backwards.\n\nIn a panic not knowing how to stop him from bleeding out since I had no magic left, no bandages, and no potions. I did have candles though, which gave me a dumb idea. So I quickly asked Arcane Trickster to light one with fire bolt then did the unsanitary work of trying to cauterize Barbarians wrist wounds with fire and molten candle wax.\n\nIt was only after I had finished my sloppy barely successful operation that Ranger bothered to remind me that she and her Forest Spirit pet both knew healing words...\n\nWe ended the session after resting until our 3 incapacitated party members could recover, having our Barbarian tell us from a vision he had that the cult actually still HAD the mask along with others somewhere in a far off mountain cave, and that our dwarven target who would likely be the only one to know where that cave was had been captured by the Yuan-Ti. \n\nNever a dull moment.",

        "text": "So my friend, my brother and I decided to try something new and different from our usual D&amp;D campaign and found a rule set for something called Prose Descriptive Qualities. It's like DnD 5e but without most of the combat, much more versatile character creation and focuses heavily on roleplay and making your character look cool. Then my friend decides he's going to write a Star Wars game for us. \n\nI play a Xa'Kai, Freelance Investigator. Think Private Eye meets John Marston with a load of charisma and a really quick draw. He also does his best to stay out of trouble because he is not a fighter. \n\nMy brother decides to play a fallen Jedi Knight named Venrik who's pretty angry about everything and does his best to get into trouble because he loves to fight. \n\nThe two characters are somehow brothers. Whatever.\n\nSo begins our story. Or rather the slightly railroaded prologue. \n\nTimes are hard for the brothers and their childhood friend, Eric. They operate a specialty Bounty Hunting/Smuggling operation within Nar Shaddaa because there's no money in anything else at the moment. They work for an Information Broker who has never given them his name.\n\nOn their way back after a successful haul, their ship is shot down by a gang of thugs and forced to make an emergency landing. Unfortunately, although the brothers make it out (albeit both pretty badly injured), Eric does not survive. The pair dart off into an alley in an attempt to shake any more unwanted attention. \n\nSuddenly, Venrik feels a strong disturbance in the Force as a hood figure appears ahead of the two and ignites a crimson lightsaber. Venrik yells for his brother to run just in time for their escape to be cut off by another hooded figure. \n\nIt is a short fight. Venrik is disarmed and beaten unconscious, and Xa'Kai is choked out. As the latter passes out, he hears an explosion followed by quickly fading footsteps. \n\nThe two later begin to wake up in a strange room. They are both wearing only their underwear and appear to be floating in some kind of liquid with an breathing mask attached to their faces.\n\nMy Brother: \"Venrik attempts to break out of this prison by exploding the tank with the Force.\"\n\nGM: \"Roll to see how effective his escape is.\"\n\nBrother rolls very well and succeeds the DC.\n\nGM: \"His escape is so violently successful that both of the bacta tanks either side of him are also shattered and healing liquid is everywhere.\"\n\nMe: \"About those tanks either side of him... Was Xa'Kai--\"\n\nGM: \"Yep.\"\n\nMe: \"...Cool.\"\n\nBefore the brothers can do anything more, the Broker shouts something over the intercom about not destroying all of his super expensive medical equipment. As it turns out, he had seen the attack via surveillance cameras in the streets and sent for the two to be retrieved. \n\nThe brothers learn that the ship which shot them down and murdered their friend was stolen from the Broker by a gang known as the Red Suns Reborn. They have also placed a Bounty of 20,000 Credits each on the Brothers' heads. \n\nThe pair leave the Broker's compound to investigate the crash site and find their friend's body in order to bury him, but his corpse is nowhere to be found. Suddenly, they are approached by a number of familiar fellow Bounty Hunters...\n\nThat's all for Part 1! Let me know if you want more. :)",

        "text": "Maid RPG... is a really weird game.I think that's about all the background you need. **WHO WANTS TO SEE A TRAIN-WRECK?!**\n\nThe story was randomly rolled for. The players were working at a maid cafe when they one day received an opportunity to work as real maids. 24 hours later they were hauling their bags through the jungles of Ethiopia. You see, they had been hired to take care of the Ethiopian president, who had recently decided to go full Bond villain and planned to take over the world. The maids would be working in his new secret evil lair in the heart of the jungle, complete with a standing army, motor pool, missile silo, and a bitchin' indoor pool. These maids (also randomly rolled) included a self-flagellating elf girl, a necromancer armed with a bazooka and could retrieve any item from her dress, a greedy spider-girl who could break into anything and carried a giant chainsaw (I think I had a nightmare like that once), and a robot lolita who spoke like a prohibition-era gangster, had a gambling problem, and could summon anything she wanted to fight with by the name of Fat Tony-chan. \n\nStrap the f*ck in everyone, this is Maid RPG.\n\nThe day starts off as normally as it could it the secret evil base of a power hungry dictator. Elf-girl was cleaning, spider-maid was impressing upon the Ethiopian president the merits of cloning oneself to ensure eternal rule over his domain, and the others were cooking breakfast for the soldiers. This was fine until they found out afterwards that, oh no, they were out of food and the nearest grocery store was in the next country over. You know what that means... [ROAD TRIP TIME!!!](http://tuxedotrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RoadTrip.png). The gang piled into a military truck and sped off to get the groceries except for spider-maid who stayed behind to do other things.\n\nTheir first encounter was with a group of jungle tribals who swung on vines onto the speeding truck. One took a rocket right to the face, one was splattered against a tree due to some expert swerving by elf-girl, and the last was bludgeoned to death when Fat Tony-chan summoned the spirit of Tupac to fight for her. Afterwards, the corpses that weren't gibed were raised by the necromancer and chilled on the top of the truck while the maids sang along to some Bon Jovi. When they made it out of the jungle, they were next attacked by a UFO. No seriously, it was on the random encounter table, a UFO flies down and attacks the party. This was defeated when they strapped the zombie tribals onto rockets and launched them point blank at the cockpit. But the flaming wreckage came down right on their truck and sent the party flying. Everyone landed with a few bruises except for the necromancer who pulled a mattress out of her dress and surfed that S.O.B. through a sea of fire and shrapnel with nary a scratch. With the truck totaled, Fat Tony-chan summoned a helicopter and the adventure continued in the air.\n\nFinally, the gang arrived at the unspecified city where they could satisfy all their shopping needs. But the question now was \"How are we going to get all these groceries without any money\"? If your first answer  wasn't \"Summon a zeppelin and airlift the entire grocery store back to base\" then you would be a perfectly sane individual and therefore not one of the party members. Since there was no one in the zeppelin yet, they tied it to the helicopter to tow it around while Fat Tony-chan flew up there with a jetpack and figured out the controls. But while they were executing their \"flawless plan\", air traffic had gotten a bit worried that a military helicopter and a zeppelin had just appeared in downtown and stolen an entire building and sent some fighter jets to shoot them down. The missiles hit, sending the zeppelin crashing down, dragging the helicopter with it. The stress of the situation finally got to the elf-girl who started laughing and spraying the chopper's gun into the city-scape as it spiraled downwards as the others bailed. As the necromancer was floating down on a parachute, watching the flaming wreck crash into and destroy a large municipal building, she received a call from spider-maid.\n\nSpider-maid had been quite busy herself back at base. After brutally eviscerating the guards to the armory with a chainsaw meant for cutting down entire buildings, she stole as many weapons as she could carry, stashed them in a tank, and cut a path straight into the jungle. She then called the necromancer for an extraction so they all could cause more mayhem together. The necromancer reached into her dress and pulled the  entire tank out, letting it fall to the ground and destroy another municipal building. The whole gang was finally reunited, having accomplished absolutely nothing pertaining to their original goal but feeling good about themselves. Then the next random encounter I rolled was a massive flood.\n\nThe rain came down fast as the maids tried to find some way to escape with their tank and weapons. Elf-girl tried to make the tank buoyant with her magic but failed miserably while Fat Tony-chan summoned the helicarrier. This mile wide flying transport immediately fell down on the city below, [destroying itself and every municipal building left standing](http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/08/miss_whoops-feature-380x285.png). With no other options, Fat Tony-chan summoned a raft for the others while she blasted off with her jetpack. But spider-maid was the very definition of greed and wasn't about to just abandon her prize. No matter how much the other tried, they couldn't pry her away from the tank and were forced to leave her as the water rose higher and higher.\n\nThe story ends with elf-girl and the necromancer rowing away into the sunset while spider-maid rests down below in her stolen tank. In the end, they destroyed and flooded an entire city, stolen from an evil dictator, eradicated the scouts of a species from beyond their solar system, and caused a national disaster on foreign soil.\n\nAnd no one remembered to get the groceries.",

        "text": "I've started to enjoy playing old man jenkins in more settings (See my last entry) so I translated him to my local shadowrun group.\n\nHe's not insane, he's a genius hacker this time who's fairly wealthy and has some nice gear as well as bouts of insanity. He's 70 years old and is the teams hack junkie.\n\nWe got a mission to hunt down a local business owners daughter who had been captured by a mob family. We had some basic information, old man jenkins was more interested in the fact that the guy spent his protection money on a ring for her birthday.\n\nSo we go to a local eatery. A mcdonalds esque restaurant. Old man Jenkins wants a snack and orders a kids meal, complete with a squeaky orc toy which he names petunia and talks to about the meal.\n\nWe notice that the guy we're hunting. Is sat by the window wolfing down the burgers. So our mage has an idea to probe the guys mind. Old man Jenkins mentions that the radio he took from their hirer could be used to track the guy if we find out what car he drives. Mind probe goes horribly and we learn that 1. the guy definitely likes burgers. and 2. He's realised someones probing his mind. He tells his goons to find the mage and goes back to his food.\n\nAs they approach our table (We don't look THAT out of place but it's fairly obvious we're not regulars) they come over and explain that someones just made a big mistake. At which point old man jenkins gets stomach cramps from the burger and begins retching in pain.\n\nThey're kinda concerned. But they're not that fussed. We manage to get the info from them about the guy, it's our target.\n\nSo the negotiator of the group explains that we feel kinda bad that this guys been disturbed by our appearance and that Dr Jenkins is an old man who can't handle the food properly so it wasn't an insult. We offer to buy him some food and take it to him. As we get the food, the dwarf tells old man jenkins to drop the food on his lap as a distraction.\n\nOld Man Jenkins nails this, by stacking royally and collapsing on the floor, commenting on the cleanliness of the establishment as he falls and apologising to petunia for landing on her. The mob boss says no harm done and gets up to go clean up in the bathroom. The dwarf follows behind.\n\nThe goons then take old man jenkins, the troll and the orc outside to talk to them. They do the rough up conversation to try and tell the team \"this isn't on\" because they're acting pretty weird, Old Man Jenkins pushes past the orc goon stating \"need a shit\" as he walks into the alleyway, unknown to the party, this is a trap so Old Man Jenkins can shock the goons and dispose of them. They don't buy it so Old Man Jenkins starts shouting at the orc \"Cmon tuskface I can shit and fight.\" and other insults.\n\nThe troll takes the diplomatic approach, by intimidating the goons into leaving them be. Old Man Jenkins emerges from the alleyway pants round ankles disappointed and after zipping up agrees to come into the eatery with them and find the dwarf.\n\nThe dwarf has successfully gotten ALOT of information from the mob boss. The girl is out back in the freezer and there's a guard blocking the way. Old Man Jenkins loudly states that he's gonna rig up a motion sensor to stop the guy leaving the bathroom. (He fails and makes a radio transmitter that beeps and has a red light) before filling Petunia with a can of explosive foam and arming it. (Apologising to the old girl of course)\n\nHe explains that if the mob boss moves off the toilet, Petunia will blow up the building. They don't care if the girl dies because they've been paid to kill him and anyone else who tries to stop the crew. The mob boss nodes silently holding Petunia who is now beeping happily.\n\nThey leave and plan their attack, with the general scheme being Old Man Jenkins hacks the system and sets off the fire alarm causing everyone to evacuate. What happens is old man jenkins triggers ALL the alarms. And the security turrets drop down, (He's currently hiding behind the troll in a booth with 2 happy meals sat in front of him and 2 more Orc toys in his pockets)\n\nThe turrets aren't activated, but everyone freaks out and flees. The goons make their way to the booth to tell us to get out. \"No can do lads\" old man jenkins pipes up, \"We gotta inspect your fridge. I'm a mechanic you see.\"\nThe goons don't buy it and without a thought pull their guns out and aim at Old man Jenkins.\n\nDwarf doesn't take kindly to this and pulls out his pistols. It's now a firefight. Old Man Jenkins is playing solitaire at this point on his laptop waiting to rehack. So the Dwarf unloads his pistols into the Orc Goons shoulder and he falls prone to the floor. Old Man Jenkins flicks the turrets on via his laptop and fires both at the other goon, who dives behind Tuskface (The name we gave our orc goon) The mage at this point executes him with a shot to the head.\n\nWe got this shit down, minus the fact someone just tried to counterhack. Old Man Jenkins don't like that and shouts \"some asshole in the kitchen just tried to get hold of the turrets. 200 credits to whoever brings me his laptop\" as he goes back to tracing the details.\n\nA guy runs out from the back (Dressed in armour and a MANAGER hat) who fails to cast a spell and yells at us. The Troll misses with his swing cleaving a chunk of the wall, the dwarf leaps over the counter and slices the guys hand off. Pockets it and runs into the kitchen with the Troll to get the hacker.\n\nThe mob guy who was trapped in the toilet has realised that there isn't a motion detector on the explosive orc toy and flings it at Old Man Jenkins, who watches as the highly explosive squeaky orc toy flies past him and lands on the floor.... the mob boss is panting heavily soaked from the sprinklers. Old Man Jenkins flicks a switch on his belt and watches at Petunia stops beeping and rotates the turrets to face the mob moss.\n\nThe other hacker then manages to get control of one turret, that fires into the booth Old Man Jenkins is sat at, he manages to duck far enough down to ignore this and shouts for the dwarf to hurry up and get the laptop. The mage at this point puts up a psionic barrier on the toilet door so the mob boss can't escape.\n\nOnce the firing stops (and the dwarf shouts for Old Man Jenkins to come inspect the freezer door) he stands up and walks over to Petunia (Giving the old girl a kiss and apologising for her being thrown so viciously) and pockets her as he walks into the back room whistling merrily.\n\nAs he gets out back the hacker is restrained by the dwarf who has the laptop and the keycard for the fridge. Old Man Jenkins (still whistling merrily) removes his revolver and shoots him in the back of the head after shouting \"Stay off my network runt\" and pays the dwarf for the laptop. He checks the door and after assuring them it's all safe he lets them rescue \"the princess\" as he keeps calling her while he looks for more goodies.\n\nThe Dwarf and Troll rescue the girl and as they leave the freezer.... Old Man Jenkins has a first aid kit that he's stashing in his pockets (now practically overflowing) and holding a large bag of what appears to be 25 rubber orc sqeaky toys. \"Company for the good lady Petunia\" he says with a smile.\n\nAt this point we can hear sirens approaching, Old Man Jenkins tells the party to meet him at the hiring house and scatter outside so we can't be caught. He slings the bag of toys over his shoulder and tells the Ogre \"Get the princess to my bike i'll drive her there. Streets no place for her\" as he takes a can of explosive foam and places it in the microwave.\n\nThe Party wait by the bike before old man jenkins comes out smiling, he removes the goons laptop and turns all the devices in the restaurant on max. He gets on the bike and says \"You lads should probably start running now, There's gonna be a big boom and they're gonna look for us\" also mentioning that he's deleted any CCTV that was on site.\n\nHe then turns to the girl and whispers, \"Buckle up princess buttercup this baby kicks like an orc on prom\" and guns it. That night the city is rocked by an explosion of sizes unheard of. There's no evidence, just a smouldering crater where this shop was and a blown power grid down town.\n\nWe turn up at the hiring house, Old Man Jenkins arrives with the dazed woman and a bag of orc toys slung over his shoulder. He drops the \"princess\" off and they get their money, including the bonus for killing the mob family.",

Plays the mandolin and very self absorbed, self proclaimed party face. \n\nDrale male bronze Dragonborn fighter. Used to be a soldier but gave that life up when he saw how people in power abuse it. Not the brightest but definitely the strongest of the group. Has a riding lizard named Harry. \n\nGrothbart male dwarf druid. Obsessed with all things dirt and rocks. The son of his villages chieftain but needs to learn to be more sociable before taking the position. Very much like Mole from journey to Atlantis. \n\nThe party, Aizargs and Co. just finished their last adventure. With their new found wealth they hired a financial advisor, a female gnome named Norma. She is pretty much the groups manager and will keep them in the black also updating them with quests and odd jobs that they can take. \n\nWith their new hire the group heads off onto the road coming upon the town of Dewford, a small fishing village. The first thing the party notices is that it's completely empty, not a soul despite the well kept nature of the buildings. They spot the local Tavern, The Stumble Inn and decide to investigate. Aizargs speaks with the Half Orc Barkeep Anders and inquires why is the town so quiet. \n\nThe half orc explains that it's been some time since they've had a visitor and that it's nice to see them, but the circumstances are bad. It seems the party came on the day of the blood tides, a horrific storm that has cursed the village for decades and has been happening much more often than usual. The village is in bad shape and could use adventures to give them a hand. Anders advises they speak with their Leader Hau and offer their help, perhaps there may be a reward. Grothbart chimes in to ask how can a storm be so bad. The half orc gravely says that anyone who is outside of during the storm, or even peaks out of their windows are never seen again. \n\nWith this new information they make their way to the town hall to inquire the terms of their help, Aizargs does not work for free and despite wanting to show she isn't evil would probably pass on helping  if it wasn't for the pressure from the other two.\n \nOnce inside they see the leader, passed out drunk. Once they wake Hau up he informs him that these red tides used to only happen once every five years when he took office but have been slowly increasing in frequency to the point that by the time they fortify the town another tide comes and undoes all their work. The morale of the militia is down and the guards just want to spend what may be their last days with their families or they leave Dewford all together. This used to be a booming port city but nobody comes or stays thanks to the curse. The only ones who stay are the ones who feel they can't turn their back on this place, just like himself he refuses to turn his back on his people. \n\nThe party agrees to help but when the subject of payment comes up Hau just returns to his ale and swiftly passes out again. \n\nAizargs decides what this town needs is a morale boost and climbs on a roof to \"give an intimidating performance to whip the people into shape\" with her mandolin and a natural 20 she is able to persuade most of the villagers to get off of their ass and help save their town instead of wait for death. \n\nThey have the resources, plenty of sandbags, planks and boards but  not the time, they had about 12 hours until nightfall and only so many workers. I presented them with a list of features in the town, and how long it would take to fortify depending on how they split their manpower. They were able to protect the housing districts, the port, guard tower, the town hall and the graveyard (after the last adventure Grothbart has a fear of angry spirits) unfortunately they couldn't save the market place or any of the guild halls which will make it very hard if not impossible to buy goods from this town after everything is said and done. \n\nThe sky goes black and the rain begins to fall, signaling the beginning of the storm, the party rushes back to the inn and of course the first thing they want to do is look out of the window despite Anders warning. Drale suggest they look  out of their window with a mirror just in case. \n\nThey notice that the winds pick up and begin to howl, the rain falls heavy, so thick it's almost like a curtain. The waves of the beach turn black, then a deep purple before finally turning a bright red. Humanoid creatures  rise from the depths of the ocean, and make their way onto shore and begin bursting into the unprotected shops dragging out their owners and militia men putting the finishing touches on their fortifications. \n\nDrale leaps into action followed closely behind by the rest of the party. They finally get a good look at these things. Bloated twisted bodies of undead covered in barnacles, kelp, and coral. They dispatch the few breaking into homes and easily kill some more that are dragging victims down to the beach. Once at the beach the battle really begins. \n\nThe party can kill these coral beings easily enough  but are outnumbered. Once they kill one more walk out from the ocean floor. \n\nOnce it seems the party has its footing a huge undead whale breaches from the water with a robed figure welding a trident on its back. With it, another horde of coral zombies. The water mage casts hold person on the fighter taking him out of battle while his minions chip away at the helpless dragon born . The Ranger and druid unable to help due to the mass of enemies. Grothbart casts thunder wave to push the horde back towards the ocean giving Aizargs a clear shot at the wizard. Unfortunately due to the insane wind her bow is almost useless. \n\nGrothbart has an idea and casts polymorph on the whale, transforming it into a giant tortoise who then sinks and drowns at the bottom of the ocean, and causes the wizard to lose concentration. Now free, Drale puts all he has into his attacks, killing the mage singlehandedly and finishing him off with a blast of lighting breath for flair. \n\nThe horde retreats but the storm still rages. Drale surmises that someone or something is causing this storm and he will get to the bottom of it. The party returns to the Stumble Inn. Anders drops the glass he was polishing in shock that they went outside and made it back alive. Aizargs states that they're just that good. \n\nIn the morning the party splits up and looks for clues as to where these creatures are coming from. They find a cove not a mile outside of town. Inside of this cavern they find what they believe to be the source of these creatures, large pods like structures that may or may not hold something inside.  They are spotted and have a deadly battle with two of these mages along with some more of their minions. The party survives but Grothbart is gravely injured. \n\nIf these powerful water mages are just minionz who or what are controlling them and will they be strong enough to stop it?",

        "text": "The parties morning consists of their town reading themselves for the evening festivities. However the lord of the land has received word that there was a troll spotted in the outskirts of the village, and tasks the adventurers with finding it.\n\nAfter several skill checks, they find the creature ram shackling around a woodsy clearing in a fit. After \"passing\" several skill checks to sooth and passify the beast; it runs at them in a mad frenzy. A great battle ensues; druid casts entangle, rangers arrows fly, the great monster breaking its bonds and batting the dual wielder across the map, all before the Cleric brings the beast down with a mighty swing of his maul.\n\nThe team notes (with wisdom checks) that this troll seemed weaker and yet more savage than the standard troll, but still chock it up to another great story to tell at the tavern they own. Yet when the druid searches the body for possible riches, the troll grasps her. Startled, the druid looks into the creatures eye; it's very Human eyes. Softly, in common, the creature whispers Ah'Marna.\n\nNo one else hears this, and when she brings their attention to the creature, it's eyes are once again that of a trolls. Returning back to the kingdom, they bring their findings to the lord who suggests they do some research into the word. They discover that Ah'Marna is the name of a very famous sorcerer and alchemist who disappeared many years ago before the Great Cleric Purge. This sorcerer was know to be very powerful and specialized in transmutation of objects and even people. He is considered to be dangerous and is a wanted man because of his stance on the Anti-Magic registration act, and his attack on the Clerics who came to force his registration.\n\nThey are tasked with finding where the troll came from to deduce if the sorcerer is still alive and how he has managed to elude capture for so long. The team sets off immediately, skill checking their way through the forests and random encounters. Three days of walking and they discover that this troll seemed to be tracking something itself, setting off from a destination and staying on a very singular path. They reach a den that had seen some battles. Bodies of highwaymen and several wolves buried hastily nearby that show signs of a troll battle; but not as savage as the typical troll. They find two sets of tracks, some of mercenaries and wolves going north, deeper into the woods; and of the troll coming from the west where another town is located. Inside they find crude human implements and strange markings on the wall of a tower with a human inside; drawn above the tower, they see a full moon and a sun. \n\nNot knowing what these mean, or what they have to do with the troll; the travelers make haste for the town to check on it's safety and to rest and resupply. Unknown to the adventures is the horror story that awaits. Blood, death, mystery, spies, monsters, kidnapping, and old dangerous magic that could draw the attention of the Anti-Magic Clerics; an even worse threat to the safety of the village.",

        "text": "So in this story we have a group of four. We have the dwarf alchemist with a penchant for being brash and forward, an elven rogue who's sensible but quiet, a human barbarian who's earnest but dumb, and a human cleric of Tymora who's old but good humored. They're questing against a cult of Tiamat threatening to overrun the realm with a swarm of hobgoblins and dragonoids, and we've thwarted them at almost every turn in every way we could. In a losing battle we've only won with a mix of grand spectacles of stealth from the rogue, strength from the barbarian, explosives and ingenuity from the alchemist, and magic from the cleric.\n\nOnly the cleric had any face skills, but everyone took part in discussions and often even rolled (albeit at -3s or 0s). The barbarian was the only one of us that could speak with the lizardfolk at a certain point so he tried his best at interrogating, and the dwarf shared gruff and violent words with the elves we went to court for aid against the goblin threat. All of this with negative charisma scores.\n\nBut when push came to shove, the cleric of Tymora was the rally point for negotiations and discussions. And as they descended into a temple of Tiamat with nothing but wits and a full spell list, they came upon a scene that made them shit their collective pants.\n\n5 figures of dull, colorful scales sat on podiums around a center dias, wisened eyes staring down at the intruders. One dragon at a time was all they'd faced, and these were large enough to be adult. One creature of each color sat and watched, and then demanded to know why we were here.\n\nAnd then the other asked if we were humans and if they were supposed to eat us.\n\n\"Wait a second,\" said the cleric's player (and the cleric under her breath), \"Those aren't dragons... Those are wyverns! They're the bitch dragons!\"\n\nAnd so we stared in awe as the wyverns discussed in simpleminded words exactly how to proceed with their guard duties. And then they took a vote.\n\n\"Quiet Rashael! To all of us who believe the humans should be eaten, say aye.\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nIt was a clever ploy by our barbarian! The rest of us were not simple minded enough to think we had a *vote* in the matter, but he took this entire scene apart and flipped it around!\n\nThe wyverns quickly descended into hysterics, demanding to know who voted no and why. The cleric quickly broke in saying, \"Rashael voted no!\"\n\n\"Rashael you blasted fool, why don't you want to eat the humans?\" the red wyvern demanded of the green wyvern.\n\n\"I d-did I did say I wanted to eat the humans!\" he wailed back.\n\n\"We know what we heard! We want to eat humans as much as the next person!\"\n\nThe dwarf quickly steered the subject away, pointing out that he was in fact not human and far too short. The elf then interjected as well.\n\nThe wyverns were angry at this and had none of it, saying that we were all pink and that made us humans, but it deflected them from the previous issue.\n\nAnd so the white wyvern argued that he hated direct democracy.\n\nThe cleric bounded forward, waving her arms and speaking sympathetically, \"Then let's go with a more bureaucratic form! As a land owner, I get a vote,\" she decides, \"Who else here owns land?\"\n\nThe black wyvern pipes up with a gruff, \"I have a hoard. It's not much, but it's a place to call home.\"\n\n\"Good! Good, I have this deed to a castle!\" she says while producing the pilfered deed, \"So that means you and I are the only land owners here. We get a vote between the two of us. How do you decide on the matter of eating humans?\"\n\nThe white was quick to interject, \"Well this isn't fair! Why don't I get a vote?\"\n\nThe cleric explains to him that through the land owner that holds his estate, he DOES get a voice. He just needs to speak with the black wyvern. They have a brief exchange before the black wyvern says, \"I vote yes on eating the humans.\"\n\nThe cleric of course votes no.\n\n\"I will not have a tie!\" the red declares, \"This is a farce! One vote for each man!\"\n\nAnd so we went around, 5 wyverns and 4 'humans.' 4 humans vote nay on eating humans, 4 of the wyverns vote aye, and just as the green dragon starts to try and vote...\n\n\"Well he already had his vote, remember?\" the cleric interjects, \"He voted no.\"\n\n\"W-well I can take it back!\" the green simpers, \"Right?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry dear, but if we start letting people take their votes back then maybe the dwarf will want to be eaten, and then we'll be here all day...\"\n\n\"So that makes it-\" the cleric starts to say before the red interjects.\n\n\"He is not a land owner! He doesn't get a vote,\" the red declares.\n\nBefore the red's claim had been finished and he'd been allowed to re-establish control over the situation, the cleric casts...\n\nSummon monster 5.\n\nAnd brings in an elfish looking planar creature who looked at first very ready for combat and then very confused.\n\n\"Do you vote nay on eating humans?\" the cleric asks it.\n\n\"I uh... Yes...?\" he fumbles, furrowing his brow, \"I vote no on eating humans.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" booms the red, \"Is he... A land owner?\"\n\n\"I uh... I have a modest holding in the celestial planes bestowed upon me by-\" he starts to say before the wyvern roars in anger.\n\nBefore the summon monster spell passed, we were through the doors leaving the chamber. Democracy always wins.",

They meant to end the duel after one of them dropped below 1/4 HP... but Coraim rolled exactly how much HP Felosial had left and knocked her unconscious. While this was happening Lexter and Iaghar were returning to Fort Cox and were already far away, so they didn't know what was going on. Vito was mysteriously absent (player was gone). What ensued was Coraim running frantically around looking for some way to help Felosial, including running up to the tower of rags that used to be the wizard, which we'd established could talk and could also inhabit people's bodies to gain his powers again, and yelled at it \"DO YOU HAVE ANY HEALING MUFFINS?! I MEAN POTIONS, HEALING POTIONS!\" He was thinking about muffins I guess. Coraim was able to stabilize Felosial with a heal check but she was still unconscious, so he went to go get help from Lexter and Iaghar.\n\nMeanwhile, in the woods, Lexter and Iaghar had found a dire wolf that they were attempting to tame... they failed, badly. They ended up fighting the dire wolf which knocked Iaghar unconscious, though Lexter was able to force a healing potion down his throat at the expense of his turn. As soon as Iaghar regained consciousness though the dire wolf smashed into Lexter's face, getting a double critical... on an already injured sorcerer. Needless to say Lexter was beyond help. Iaghar managed to kill the dire wolf in a rage over his lost friend and he and Coraim carried him back to the yak town and healed Felosial.\n\nThe nearest place that offers resurrection services is across the country, is incredibly expensive, plus everyone in the party except a new character Lexter's player would make and Felosial are wanted for treason, so resurrection may be impossible.",

        "text": "This is from the view of my Bard PC. Quite abit into the campaign but I hope it's entertaining nonetheless.\n\nHere's where it got strange. It started the past day, when we riding for the ruins and I saw something that frightened me to the core, and I've seen a lot of horrible things, living on the streets as a Half-Orc runt will do that to you. But this was just horrifying. We had passed a field where there were some scarecrows, I was the only one to give them a second glance, I'm young, hardly ever been out of the city so scarecrows were new to me. But then some of them turned their heads and watched us as we past by. That is not normal even for out of the city. They were staring right at us, and grinning manically, or maybe that's just their normal face. But I freaked out and bolted. The other's had no idea and gave chase. \nOh yes, I haven't introduced our 'merry bunch'. I am named Oot Hetoot, a choice name seeing as I am a bard. Yes I am a half-Orc but a bard, did I mention I was born a runt. But that didn't stop me finding a way to survive. \nMy favourite person amongst our lot is the half-elf merchant. A flour merchant he says, but the man fights like a whirlwind. Alas I fear everything that has happened is abit too much for him. He seems to become edgier with every passing moment. Wander Manytongues is his name, and live to it he does (he speaks ALL of the common tongues!! An incredible feat, and he chooses to swear in a different tongue each day which is music to my ears. Except for the giant, that's just weird).\nWe also have another half-Orc who joined us recently, don't know much about him but he seems passably normal. A small personal quest of vengeance seems to be on his mind which is understandable given all that has happened. Romarod the proud he names himself, so far he seems as proud as a tomato.\nNow...the baron. He has a reputation despite his youth (for a human). And it isn't a good one. He claims loyalty beyond all else but the whorish serpent has more on his agenda than I can imagine. Baron Anal Blackhole...sorry I couldn't help myself. His real name and title is Baron Anders Greyhold....but still....if you heard the stories.\nThere is an interesting cleric among us that (thank all on high) is on 'our' side. A cleric of Zeus so you can tell what his lot are like. 'YOU DO NOT BELIEVE, THEN YOU EXPLODE IN HOLY THUNDER GRAAAH' and all that. Kaldin he calls himself, a name as humble as his standing, despite being a cleric of Zeus.....\nFinally there is the....demoness sorceress? A demon-thing who has thing for hugging our enemies. The other's think she simply has unnatural kindness for a daughter of asmodeus but seeing how asmodeus' will is what we are fighting....I have my eye on this one, Naphy, even her name is twisted.\nBack to the day's events.\nAfter bolting the other's convinced me to show them what had frightened me so, and we returned to the field...to find the scarecrows gone. Now I was truly terrified. I'm remembering stories of the terrible fae harvest God, who takes the form of a giant scarecrow, this doesn't bode well.\nWe returned to the ruins and entered, we found the typical foul beasts of the depths, skeletons, wights and so on. There was a fire elemental but we chose to ignore him. However when coming upon another half-Orc who seemed to be from Romarod's village. After releasing his chains he faded away, probably the chains had tied his soul to the mortal realm, denying him peace.\nNow here is where things 'Hit the Shit'. I wasn't entirely noticing what he other's were doing. All o heard was an almighty crack and turned to see the magical glow leaving Wander's enchanted hammer. And then laughing, an eerily familiar laughing. It sounded suspiciously like the demon worshipping '&amp;@**' from the crystal ball we had found a while back. I thought we'd thrown his ass into the astral plane. Well we ran, cos fk that noise. \nWe came across what was a worship 'thing' to the fae God Cyric of the harvest. A statue holding a horn of plenty. We placed foodstuffs into the statue and it proceeded to open a portal...which we ran through.....our merry bunch seems to share a common stupidity streak. \nWhere did we end up? Oh in the realm of the fae of course. Battling the god Cyric.....for '**%&amp;@**' sake.\nSo after a few minutes of battling his minions and dealing sod all to his ass, all the whilst Naphy berates him for his 'dress sense ' of all things!!, we realised, this sht ain't goin nowhere. So Kaldin, in his alright Zuhadist glory, cast a command spell on Cyric and IT WORKED!?! He managed to force the fae God to send us back to the ruins...by this point I'd decided all card's were on the table, so to speak *wink wink*. I'll explain now.\nI was granted, I say granted but held onto and never gave back' a deck of cards. These cards summoned...things. The first time it was death itself and the 3rd time was a little retarded goblin so you can tell it ranges in effectiveness. \nWe came using a ritual chamber, containing 'Crystal Ball Motherfucker' and a demonic version of a btch we'd already killed....because everyone we kill seems to enjoy RETURNING FROM OBLIVION!! \nAnyhow....we readied for a battle and I decided this was a good time as any to pull a card.\nAnd...well this will explain our current slightly broken mindset. 'I' became 'we'. For the few of you who have never experienced a crisis of multiple identity, I essentially became 2 people....I had summoned myself and thusly split myself into two resulting in....well you'd never understand any ways.\nSo we and the rest of our part proceeded to battle these fools, now we had some experience fighting the crystal ball fcker, whose name is index to make it simpler on you folk, and we decided the first thing to do would be to shut him up.\nSo we proceed to split the tasks, first I cast a field of silence upon him and the my self proceeded to shoot him. Watching him scream first at pain and then the frustration of not being able to scream was priceless. We were enjoying it immensely. This battle continued for a while we're I drew out a half- Orc barbarian, (half Orc swogger) (for clarification: S.W.O.G= superbly wonderful orcish goodness) \nand we discovered the demonic bimbo could command demonic chains, how original. \nIn true honest she and her chains may have been a problem if Wander hadn't gone all 'Red Sister' on her, she had more stab wounds than a Drow at a political wedding.\nAnd index was pinned between the two of me banshee screaming into his ear whilst our half-Orc barbarian pounded him into oblivion. Index summoned some kind of growing light orb in the middle of the room but we assumed he had lost the plot and was casting willy nilly. Eventually the '#%**@' died for good and demonic btch lost the will to fight. After breaking the silence field and some closer examination we realised the orb was basically a big boom fireball that would put our cleric to shame.\nRealising this and showing an incredible will to live, Wander proceeded to smash the wall to create an escape path....yes not a half-ofc, dwarf or dragonkin, but a HALF-ELF smashed through a SOLID STONE WALL by venting his frustrations upon it. I'm liking the guy more and more. \nRunning to where there should have been an exit, discovered that the stairwell had been collapsed and the time it took to shift the rubble would have results in some extra crispy halfbreeds.\nSo what did we do? Summoned the fae God Cyric and made a deal with him for the Baron's soul of course for safe passage out. (Did we mention our party's intelligence).\nNow we are going have to deal with our separate personalities in one body, (the cards don't last forever) and have 14 days to find the Baron's soul-double, trick a fae God and proceed with our quests to undermine the plans of the Lord of hell. Have we mentioned how much fun we have had with this adventure outside of the city? \n\n\n\n",

She made the deal that Benina will decide things for her and as a test she was told to stay in that box.\n\nWe didn't know that and Benina just joined our group a few sessions ago so we were pretty suspicious when we found out. We naturally thought the ghoul might have been killed and she was trying to use her in a ritual or something, the Giovanni being Necromancers and shit.\n\nWhen Samuel wanted to open the box, Benina tried to Dominate him into going away. When that didn't work (Iron Will merit, makes you essentially immune to mindcontrol) Samuel fell into frenzy and attacked everyone nearby.\n\nSadly the nearest person was aforementioned ghoul and so he grabbed her and swung her into the face of Benina which was surprisingly effective. Now she grabbed onto the ghoul and he was swinging two people around (Yaay Potence).\nWhen he attacked Sheryn, with which was essentially a giant meat club, he slammed her into the ship hull and dealt a ridiculous amount of damage, he rolled 10 successes.\n\nOur ST decided that this damage also applied to the ship and Samuel basically punched a hole, three women wide, into the ship of his boss.\n\nTo wrap it up: The ghoul survived, barely, we managed to save the ship and Samuel was really heartbroken about all this and decided to apologize to everyone except Benina, because she started it.\n\nTL;DR: If you try to mindcontrol the Brujah, he will smash you through a wall, because his meat club gets too heavy if too many people grab onto it.\n\nEDIT: Namespelling",

Out-gunned and under heavy fire, Event Horizon made the only choice that made sense at the time: Using some very impressive high-speed manoeuvring and his own enhanced density, the speedster managed to bring down one of the alien fighter craft. The only problem? It landed directly on top of Lawrence. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\n\"You utter failure!\" The eerie silence of New York City was shredded by Barghast's furious roar. \"Of all the avenues granted to you by that technological marvel, this was your choice?\" Swathed in shadows, the empowered cannibal stalked closer to his prey. \"You possess such an utter lack of sophistication and tact that I should tear you limb from limb, if only to save the world from your imbecilic decisions!\" The Baron stretched to his full, towering height as crimson eyes glared balefully down at the object of his fury. \"What have you to say for yourself?\" Event Horizon rolled his eyes and sipped from his mug once more, enjoying the taste of caffeine that followed.\n\n\"Listen close, you walking brown-note. I don't care that you fucking eat people, I don't care that you've been eyeing me off like so many fish fingers and I don't care that your breath smells like a bloody slaughterhouse.\" The java-enthusiast leaned in close, eyes locked with those of the beast. \"But if you try and tell me that fucking leaves in hot water is superior to coffee again, we're going to have a problem.\" Silence reigned in the ruined Starbucks once more as the two criminals stared at each other. Minato sat slumped against one of the few intact walls, head cradled between his knees. The con-man had stopped shaking some minutes back, seemingly content to stare at the broken tiles beneath him. \"How's it coming, people?\" Event Horizon called out, still glaring at the stuff of nightmares.\n\n\"Not good, sir. Those heat weapons did a number on the truck. Even with the proper tools, this would take hours.\" One of the mercenaries reported back, his helmet protecting him from the steam rising up beneath the hood. \"My suggestion is that we radio Pilot for evac, ASAP. I don't doubt there are more Zel'tan on the way.\" Barghast snarled once more in frustration, spraying flecks of fetid saliva in Event Horizon's face. The speedster winced and wiped the ooze off with his sleeve. Baron Rotezhan cackled triumphantly, turning away from their little contest. \n\n\"See that it is done. We require these resources if we are to be victorious over our cold-blooded foes.\" Event Horizon scoffed quietly at Barghast's vernacular, draining another sip from his ambrosia. \"Get the fox back on his feet. We require haste in this endeavour, not cowardice.\" The void-walker barked over his shoulder before diving into the destroyed Talon, his immaterial form vanishing beneath twisted metal. Frowning at the order he was given, Event Horizon obeyed nonetheless. He squatted beside Kitsune and gave the almost-catatonic man a light shake. Kitsune's gaze snapped onto him with laser precision, eyes finally focused. The speedster before him was hesitant to speak but found his voice soon enough.\n\n\"You doing okay? That wasn't your first firefight, was it?\" Kitsune dully recognised the barest hint of concern in Event Horizon's voice but his mouth was already moving of it's own accord. \n\n\"My first fire-fight? No. My first open conflict with a technologically advanced species of murderous aliens? Golly gosh, I think it might just be.\" The sarcasm was strong with this one. Event Horizon rolled his eyes and slapped Minato across the forehead. The coffee lover rose up with a scoff, forcibly hauling Kitsune to his feet and dusting him off with a blur of motion. Minato tried to struggle against the speeding nuisance but to no avail. Finally, Event Horizon ceased his tidying and grinned at the perturbed superhuman before him.\n\n\"Yeah, you're fine. Look on the bright side, chief. Could have been you that got crushed by a spaceship.\" His smile turned sardonic as the speedster zipped away, throwing a final comment over his shoulder. \"Things could always be worse!\" Kitsune watched him go with an irate grumble. Straightening his suit with practised motions, the con-man took a moment to brace himself before stepping out of the ruined store. Three mercenaries were removing crates from the truck as quickly as possible, uncaring of how much noise they created, while the fourth stood by on watch. Barghast rose silently from the smouldering wreckage, one long arm trailing behind him as Lawrence was forcibly phased through debris. The suit had certainly seen better days, charred around the edges and still red-hot from the explosion, but it appeared to be intact. The occupant, on the other hand...\n\n\"Oh my god! It exploded? Why did it explode? Did I do that? Did I kill the ship? Wow, I'm amazing! Hey guys!\" Lawrence's rambling came to a screeching halt as Event Horizon zoomed to a stop alongside him. There was an echoing clang as unbreakable staff struck high-tech armour, making Barghast wince at the sudden reverberation. Lawrence staggered and collapsed to one knee, his already damaged battle-suit buckling under the assault. His armoured visor was wrenched up to meet Event Horizon's furious glare. Whatever the rookie pilot had been about to say, now remained nothing but shocked silence. After a moment of establishing dominance, the caffeine addict smiled grimly and spoke.\n\n\"The only reason you're still alive is because of that very shiny toy you're wearing. Every-time it gets damaged, there's less of a reason to keep you around. You did fuck all to the Lizard ship, you stood by and let your team-mates tangle with threats they couldn't handle and you almost cost us a very expensive piece of equipment. So let me say one thing before we move on...\" Event Horizon leaned in, close enough now that his breath turned to fog across the visor. \"Shape the fuck up before I peel you out of that thing and feed you to Barghast.\" The eldritch abomination in question let loose a rumbling chuckle before loping off into the shadows. \"He'll do it too and without a seconds hesitation. So, are we clear?\" There was a silent, sullen nod but Event Horizon tightened his grip with a groan of metal. \"Let me hear you say it, kiddo. Use your big-boy words.\" \n\n\"I'll be more careful.\" Lawrence spoke with a strangely refreshing mixture of churlish anger, apprehension and mild terror. Satisfied with this proclamation, the hyper-active criminal released his captive and dashed away. While the armoured behemoth slowly returned to his feet, Kitsune strode forth from the crumbling store with renewed confidence. Marching over to the ruined vehicle, Minato smiled darkly at the troopers and began issuing their orders. \n\n\"I want a perimeter established around this block and an inventory of whatever survived. You two, you're on patrol duty.\" Gesturing to the duo in question, Minato flicked his communicator to life. \"Barghast, go with them. I want you on over-watch. Don't engage unless absolutely necessary.\" An affirmative growl echoed across the open channel as the mercenaries hustled away, a shadowy form stalking after them. Minato nodded towards the remaining soldiers. \"I want one of you on stock-take and the other on watch. We can't afford for anyone or anything to sneak up on us again.\" They saluted and set to work while their leader turned his scrutiny to the buildings around them. \"Event Horizon, I want a check of every building within eye-shot of us. Earshot as well, if you can manage it.\" The speedster in question rolled his eyes scornfully but hurtled through the nearest doorway. \n\nDuring the battle, things had happened so suddenly that every action was a blur of violence and motion. Now, time passed agonisingly slowly. Minato was conscious of every potential threat, his recently developed hyper-alertness transforming mundane sounds into fictional danger. Every now and then, one of his scouts would report an 'all clear' from the surrounding area but it did nothing to alleviate his growing paranoia that someone was watching him. Minato turned out to be justified, as Lawrence spoke up.\n\n\"Uh, guys? The suit says that it's detecting radio transmissions from somewhere in the area and that the source is moving towards us.\" Not a moment after he had spoken, Barghast reported in with a guttural growl.\n\n\"A small squadron of armed troops are en route to the crash site. Humans.\" Minato whipped around with a large grin on his face, straightening his tie as he walked. \"Some of them look quite...delectable.\" If Kitsune was disturbed by the ravenous edge to the cannibal's voice, he masked it masterfully. \n\n\"My apologies, Barghast. I'm afraid that meat is off the menu for now. Should you so desire, please try one of the Zel'tan while I meet with our guests.\" His tone, while pleasant, brokered no discussion. There was some dissatisfied grumbling over the communicator but Minato ignored it in favour of striding towards the now visible group. They were clearly trained, police if not military, and they froze upon seeing him. One of them in particular paled at the sight of Kitsune, evoking a wide smile from the charismatic criminal. \"Detective Knowles! What a pleasure to see you again. My sole regret is that the circumstances are so poor.\" The unit reacted with admirable speed, bringing weapons to bear on the super-villain. One of their number, the aforementioned Officer Knowles, barked an order at him.\n\n\"That's close enough, Arisato. You try anything funny and there won't be a cosy cell waiting for you this time.\" The veteran law enforcer gave him a warning look, hands steady against the cool metal of his weapon. Minato bowed slightly in acquiescence, hands outstretched. Knowles assessed the situation with a keen eye, noting the heavily armoured titan behind him and the armed operatives nearby. \"What are you doing here? I thought you were locked up with the rest of the powered types.\" Minato nodded reassuringly before responding.\n\n\"I was. Suffice to say, I escaped at the same time the Zel'tan struck. An alien invasion worked quite well as a smokescreen for my liberation. May I ask what your purpose is here?\" The New York detective snorted, eyes narrowed suspiciously. \n\n\"Heard the explosion, thought we might be able to scavenge something of use. Looks like you beat us here.\" Knowles spoke with bitterness, though Minato managed to pick out the slightest hint of awe in his voice. \"I know when the odds are against me. We'll be on our way.\" He gestured towards the other men and women with him, swaddled in various uniforms. The rag-tag unit began to move when Minato stepped forward. A chorus of clicks responded as safeties were switched off. The con-man raised his hands in an attempt to convey passivity.\n\n\"You need not go anywhere. I suspect our goals might be more aligned than you think. Some friends and I have decided to reclaim New York City from the Zel'tan, by whatever means necessary.\" There was a blur of motion and the resistance fighters spun to aim at Event Horizon, leaning casually against a wall and slurping loudly at a steaming hot coffee. He gave the group a jaunty wave, unconcerned by their paltry weapons. Strands of thick liquid splattered across one of the survivors, the man wiping at it in confusion before looking up. The hardened law enforcer screamed in terror, his squeal mingling with a d ark chuckling from above the motley. Barghast loomed halfway out of the building beside them, crimson eyes glaring hungrily down at them as thick strands of saliva dripped from his open maw. The team began to move back, weapons switching between each villainous target. Their path was obstructed when Lawrence slammed down behind them, cracking the concrete beneath his immense weight.\n\n\"Hey guys, I can fly!\" The voice of Mickey Mouse booming out from the colossal machine may have been the last straw for the group, had Minato not reigned in the situation.\n\n\"As I said: My friends and I are here to free New York City. We may have had our differences in the past, Detective, but the truth is that we must band together now. Our foe is no common street gang or costumed criminal; these reptiles seek the destruction or enslavement of the entire human race. Now, we may be bad...\" Kitsune trailed off, stepping forward with his hand outstretched towards Knowles. \"But even we think that's evil.\" Under ordinary circumstances, the detective would have told Minato where to go and written him a map with the back of his hand; between the invasion, the people he had lost and the subtle influence of The Voice, Knowles lowered his weapon. There was still a critical gleam in his eye but Minato saw the cogs working now, the thought of justice or revenge filling the righteous man. Honestly, it was almost appallingly easy to manipulate the good guys. He smiled widely when he felt his hand taken, giving the police officer a firm handshake before nodding at Barghast.\n\n\"We will remain here to continue procuring supplies for our cause. Fox, take the squirrel with you and speak with their leaders.\" Barghast hissed down at the group before retreating inside, his nebulous form vanishing in a cloud of darkness. Event Horizon blinked once, or possibly a dozen times, before frowning.\n\n\"Am I meant to be the squirrel? Why the fuck am I the squirrel? That's fucking rude, you overgrown pomeranian!\" The speedster hollered up at the empty space, receiving silence in return. \"Asshole. Fucking squirrel, I'll give you a fucking squirrel...\" As his colleague continued to mutter violently under his breath, Minato smiled reassuringly at Knowles. The detective had apprehended several super-powered criminals in his time, treating this as just another day on the job. \n\n\"I take it that you've got some kind of central command structure somewhere? Refugees and civilians hidden away underground?\" Minato chirped merrily at his newest ally as his team resumed work. Knowles nodded grudgingly, scanning their surroundings with a wary eye.\n\n\"That's right. We've bunkered down in the subway system. Lizards haven't been pressing into the underground, not that we know why. If you want to get there and back by nightfall, we'll have to get moving now.\" Supervillain and detective regarded each other for a moment before Minato shrugged in acceptance. As the mismatched group started to move off, Kitsune spoke into his communicator. \n\n\"Barghast, keep everyone on task. I want the inventory triple-checked and ready to move when Pilot can get into the sky. Lawrence, see if you can move the damn truck off of the street if you can. We'll be back as soon as possible.\" There was a round of acknowledgements as they bustled to work. Event Horizon fell into line, still grumbling about Barghast. Though there were multiple complaints about the agonisingly slow pace from Event Horizon, Kitsune agreed that it was probably better safe than sorry. After half an hour of ducking between alley ways and dodging Zel'tan patrols, the assortment of weirdos managed to slink down the stairs to one of New York City's subway system. From there, it was another fifteen minutes of following Knowles through dark subway tunnels, finally ending in a formerly abandoned station that was now filled to the brim with families huddling together for warmth. Several hundred people, sharing supplies and praying to whichever deity they preferred that the Zel'tan wouldn't find their way down here. \n\nThere were almost fifty armed individuals, stationed at various points through the station and acting as a rudimentary defence force. More were appearing from other tunnels or service entrances, bearing whatever resources they could find. Overseeing all of this was a middle-aged woman dressed in United States Army Fatiuges, her hair in a bun. Runners from across the station were reporting into her, giving her information about the outside world. Despite a small horde of scouts providing her with status reports, the leader noticed her new arrivals immediately. She raised a hand and, like Moses parting the Red Seas, the din faded away. She gave Knowles a respectful nod, which was returned quickly, before turning her attention to the super-villains.\n\n\"I recognise the two of you. You've done more than your fair share of horrible shit...but humanity might just be an endangered species right now. You're as welcome as any, long as you don't cause any trouble.\" Event Horizon grinned wickedly, quite ready to immediately cause trouble, before Minato placed a restraining hand on his shoulder. Giving the con-man a beleaguered look, Event Horizon sighed and held his peace. Kitsune stepped forward with his most charming smile and began to speak.\n\nTen minutes later, the Resistance was packing everything up and preparing to take the war to the Zel'tan. Event Horizon was staring at his companion with barely concealed horror as hundreds of people, all victims of The Voice, carried out Minato's will. The charismatic villain stood with a small, pleased smile as his new army danced to his commands like puppets on strings. The caffeine addict swallowed once, having finally recognised that he had been afraid of the wrong team-member: Barghast would only kill and eat you...Kitsune would turn you into a mindless puppet. As Minato turned his gaze back to his ally, he found an expression of detached curiosity staring back. The speedster could never let anyone know how much the effeminate, physically weak villain terrified him.\n\n\"One of the scouts mentioned something about the Zel'tan taking prisoners, which is unusual in itself. They managed to follow the reptiles back to a large vessel over Madison Square Garden. I think that should be our next target, don't you? Deny the lizards resources and retrieve more fighting forces for us. With a small strike force, we should be able to infiltrate the vessel and break everyone out. What do you think?\" Event Horizon shrugged nonchalantly, taking another sip of his latest caffielogical monstrosity before chirping back.\n\n\"Whatever you say, boss.\"  ",

        "text": "While lurking as many do I was reminded of a old gem of a PC I had the greatest pleasure of co-creating. Now I know everyone and their girlfriend has had a joke character before but I think this one might be on par with some of the greatest of his race.  With all that said, I played a Orc Bard named **CLONG** (who later earned the surname of **STONEBREAKER**, more on that later) to which I found somewhere to translate from Ork to mean 'The Destruction of all and everything' of which now looking back was foreshadowing but for **completely** different reasons than I had thought at the time. A few things to note about him was although he did speak in the third person and in semi-broken common he was actually quite intelligent and wise (3.5e 16 &amp; 14 respectfully.)\n\nMoving on I will now relay an encounter one of my online groups had with this PC. The scene was laid out as thus; the group had just arrived back from a previous adventure worn and torn from the epic adventure but sadly had lost one of their men. After resting and coming to the conclusion that they were in need of another brave soul to help with their noble quest, so logically they asked around the tavern for any volunteers. \n\nClong overhears this and since I described him as hooded large man quietly drinking his ale in the corner. I ask the DM \"Is there a stage for performers in this tavern? Since ya know I'm a bard and maybe they asked me to be musical entertainment for their guests and what not?\" \"Yeah sure but it's right next to the group that entered and is asking for help from others.\" \"That's okay.\" From there Clong proceeds to get on stage (still hooded) and clear his throat, catching the attention of everyone in the room. \n\nThrowing a gold coin to one of the barmaids he simply asks for for her to get him his cloak and Mandolin from his table alongside his drink. Upon dawning the requested items he chungs the rest of the ale before pulling back his hood revealing himself.\n\nUnbeknownst to me the group had previously angered a rather large tribe of Orcs only a few sessions ago so needless to say when they brought up their arms against me it was with them in mind. Clong loudly and proudly states \"Me Clong Stonebreaker and Clong will join your band of good-doers!\" After a second of silence the leader of the group speaks up \"Oh really now? What pray tell makes you think you can aid us in our journey against not only evil but those of your kind?\" It was at this point that I was kinda stuck as to what Clong would say but luckily I recalled a really funny song to mind and so I thought it would fit in this situation. Clong began playing his instrument rather well (got a 17 I think) to which I told the group I sang of song of my greatness and worthy attributes to help them on there way.\n\nAt this point the DM spoke up saying that if I'm serious then I gotta actually sing it, she was joking of course but since I had the song in my head anyways I was like \"Alright, if I do can I cast prestidigitation within my song to add extra UMPH to the proformance?\" \"Roll concentration.\" (Rolled a 19) \"Yeah sure, make sure to mark off the spell from your dailies.\" It was then at this time guys I sang...\n\n&gt; *Sometimes don't you wish you were even more awesome than you already are?\n&gt; What would Clongs life be like if Clong turned this shit up to eleven (out of a possible five)?*\n\n*The group looks at me funny as I was told before I continue on with the song.\n\n&gt; \"Alright, let's go!\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Riding straight out of your imagination\n\n&gt; Using Clongs magic to fight against crime\n\n&gt; Destroying evil with powers most awesome\n\n&gt; Protecting the weak almost all of the time.\n\n&gt; But not Sundays, the whorehouse awaits!\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Now is the time for a man of conviction\n\n&gt; The world needs a hero, and Clong is that guy.\"\n\n*Clong in a Girlish voice*\n\n&gt;~ Look! Who is that masked man?\n\n*Normal Clong*\n\n&gt; That's my friend, but shut up about him. Let's focus on me, because...\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I am the Unicorn Wizard\n\n&gt; Riding for justice on a comet of stars\n\n&gt; With the help of my sidekick Princess Handjob\n\n&gt; I'm more awesome and smarter than I already are.\"\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I am the Unicorn Wizard\n\n&gt; Clongs spells are amazing, and Clongs reflexes quick\n\n&gt; Clongs horn is Clongs strength and Clongs strength is Clongs power\n\n&gt; And Clongs power is Clongs horn and Clongs horn is Clongs dick.\"\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Here's your opportunity to stop listening if this song got too amazing for you.\"\n\n\n*The group is utterly speechless and before one of them had a chance to speak up I kept going.*\n\n&gt; \"No? OK.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Clongs life is a party, the guests are superstars\n&gt; Operation: Clong Rules is a total success\n&gt; Every day Clong invent a new form of ORCate\n&gt; That changes the way that the East views the West\"\n\n&gt;\"Now's that's progress! Doitashi Mashitay! \n\n*(Japanese for; You're welcome. Or Orc in this case.)\n\n&gt; \"Then we retire to Clongs Chamber of Passion\n\n&gt; And bathe in pool of strawberries and cream\n\n&gt; The strawberries rub and exfoliate gently\n\n&gt; The cream travels places you can't even dream\"\n\n*Clong girlish voice* \n\n&gt; Ugh, I think I just dreamed it.\n\n*Normal Clong*\n\n&gt; How was it? Amazing?\n\n*Girlish Clong* \n\n&gt; Uhh..\n\n*Normal Clong*\n\n&gt; You mean Uhh...stounding? Yeah. You do.\"\n\n&gt; \"Clong is the Unicorn Wizard\n\n&gt; Just like Larry Spitfire, Clong handsome and strong\n\n&gt;With the help of Clongs hellhounds Righty and Lefty \n\n*Clong hold up his hands*\n&gt; Clong punish the wicked then break into song\"\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Clong is the Unicorn Wizard\n\n&gt; A superhero for the entire race\n\n&gt; Clong wand casts a spell that will unlock the door\n\n&gt; And the wand is Clongs junk and the door is your face!\"\n\nNow it was at the very end that my speakers explodes with laughter from the DM and I think one of the other players. Needless to say the DM laughed for like 5 minutes straight and Clong was allowed into the group with a bit more respect then I had thought he might get. Though one of them asked if he was gay or something to which he replied \"Clong not from pink Orc tribe.\" Anyways to wrap this all up I got a free 100 exp outta making the DM laugh and I just wanted to share this awesome moment with you guys.\n\nPS:the song I parodied in that game was [\"Unicorn Wizard\" by Ninja Sex Party](https://youtu.be/Gbra-rKXzk4?list=PLcIDqHah6ZnCp48Mixo9UvT505e7itqp7), check them out if you want a quick laugh or two. Also if you anyone likes this I have at least four other great tales of CLONGs greatness shining ever so brightly!",

Every NPC the group has met had warned them against going near the well, including the bandit they had captured. The entry way to the dungeon was locked and everything hinted towards not being able to proceed until later on. Of course my PC's had no intention of being blocked from progress to a quest this early on, so three of the party (6 in total) descended via the well (oh shit) with a feather fall spell. \n\nInside awaiting them, in the final room of the dungeon, a Gibbering Mouther. The party is level 2, and Maogash, not realising the danger, ran straight up to it and used his breath weapon which was ineffective at best. Trying to flee he got caught with an attack of opportunity and of course... I rolled nat 20. Full damage on crit is 30+5d6. Maogash's HP was 15. \n\nInsta-death. \n\nSucked under the writing mass of flesh and gaping maws. The cacophonous chattering, screaming and moaning replaced for a few seconds with the sound of crunching, slurping and ripping as the Golden Dragonborn known as Maogash was devoured.\n\nSo that's a bunch of story down the drain, the PC did re-roll quick and rejoined the game and the other two players managed to escape unharmed. I guess now the PC's know the danger is real.\n\nTL;DR Player died because I dangled a high level quest in front of players too low to deal with it.\n\n ",

        "text": "So, this is another story of our boat-faring ne'er-do-wells, and the absurd crap they encounter.  Now, this group is prone to rather extended hiatuses, due to the fact that we all have busy schedules and that oftentimes, interest waxes and wanes.  So, the last game we played before this was about 3-4 months before, and I don't remember exactly what went on, but I know that our DM introduced two new, seemingly unrelated quests.  The first was the pig poster that I have alluded to previously, and the other was to search the sewer for the maintenance crew that hasn't reported back in a couple days.  Now, I've mentioned that I am relatively new to the group, having been in only a handful of games before the extended break in play.  Especially in a group like this, that means that I have missed a staggering amount of ridiculous tales of hijinks, with an impressive amount revolving around the Paladin player's old Rogue.  Now, I'm not fully filled in on the details, but apparently, sometime in the past, the rogue and another old character butchered an entire pig farm and its owners for kicks and giggles.  Perhaps they had a taste for bacon and got caught.  Who knows.  Anyway, one little piglet was spared, who they promptly named Macintosh, and became almost a mascot for the party.  That is, until he was sold to some random stranger in another city via intimidation.  So, when we saw the pig poster, the old guard of the group instantly thought that the poster was for Macintosh, but we were quickly assured that this was not the same.  So, this pig poster was created by a child, and had a simplistic drawing of a pink pig, and read \"Lost pig.  Answers to Mr. Locksley.  Reward for safe return\" in a childish scrawl.  We put this on the backburner, and when we got back in the game, we decided we were going to check out the sewers.  Now, I just want to reiterate before I continue that it had been months IRL since we looked at the pig poster, so excuse us for not realizing sooner.  Anyway, it was my War Cleric, the Ancient Paladin, the Berzerker, and an Elven Beastmaster exploring the sewers.  We found the usual; giant spiders, giant poisonous mushrooms (that the Berzerker promptly licked).  Nothing exceptional.  That is, until we reach the top right corner of this quadrant of sewer, where we found three dead dismembered humans.  Upon closer inspection, we discover that 1) it's the maintenance crew, and 2) there's a troll tooth lodged in one of the bodies.  Mass Oh Crap ensues.  We continue exploring the sewers, vowing to find and put down the troll.  Two spiders later, it encounters us.  Out of the shadows emerges a troll, bizarrely looking pink and wearing a collar.  We assumed he was affected by some sort of magic, and so we proceeded cautiously.  After both our Paladin and our Berzerker almost dying, we manage to put it down with some good hits.  Examining the body, we find that its skin was dyed pink, and that the collar read Mr. Locksley.  At this point, we were worried that there was some malevolent entity that was training trolls and using them to attack the city.  This is where you may be wanting to kick us for not realizing, but trust me.  We kicked ourselves pretty hard once we figured it out.  So, now the previous two stories ensue, and we go back to check the Emerald Enclave bulletin board for any new quests.  This is when we put it together, as that's where the pig poster was hanging.  So, we went and got the troll collar from the Berzerker (who took it for reasons known only to his Dragonborn-y self), and go to the address on the bulletin.  We knock on the door, and a little six-year old girl answers.  As the party face, the task of breaking the news falls to me, so I bend down, and tell her, \"I'm sorry.  We found Mr. Locksley in the sewers, and we think that you should have this back.\"  She goes back inside, and gets her father.  He comes out, I pull him aside, and ask if he knew that Mr. Locksley was a troll.  Dumbfounded and surprised, we relay the story of how we found him.  Apparently, he'd never seen Mr. Locksley; whenever he was out working the field, his daughter would just go out and play with her friends, and one day started coming back with stories of her pet \"pig\" Mr. Locksley.  Immensely impressed with his little girl, he gives us 5 gold for returning the collar, and goes back inside.  Our DM then relays that he's had the story of Mr. Locksley ready long before the hiatus, and was waiting for us to find it.  Now, there are other stories to be told about our little ragtag bunch, and new ones are bound to arise, but those will have to wait for another time.",

        "text": "So, once again in the eclectic boat-faring party I spoke of previously, a few of us decided to take up the quest of stopping a group of bandits that was terrorizing caravans going down the road into the city.  For this, it was my War Cleric, the Oath of the Ancients Paladin, and a 6'9\" female Elven bard.  We go down the road looking for any sign, and after a couple hours in-game, we find tracks leading to a carving on a tree of a bandit insignia.  Finding tracks, we go into stealth (well, the bard does.  The Paladin and I are both in heavy armor, and I have a -2 Dexterity modifier) and follow the tracks into a camp.  Four burlap tents surround a large bonfire that had been out for several hours.  Naturally, we start poking around in the tents, and end up finding a sleeping man in one of them.  Having a net 1 on my stealth, he wakes up, and doesn't attack me.  Good sign.  We talk a little bit, and he states that he's with a hunting party that's been out for several weeks, and hadn't seen nor heard anything about a group of bandits in the area.  We wait for his compatriots to arrive, just idly waiting and talking.  The bard, having rolled a net 27 on her stealth, did not want to relinquish her near-invisibility, so she stayed hidden in a tree.  Hours later, 6 hunters come back carrying some freshly killed deer, and my suspicions were completely relieved that these were not the bandits after a set of stellar Insight checks.  We talk for a while, and they hadn't had any sign of the bandits.  I then ask them why tracks leading to a bandit crest head into their camp.  Suitably worried, they begin checking their belongings and stores to make sure they weren't robbed while away.  Meanwhile, the bard starts looking around, and notices a foot dangling from the tree next to her.  After rolling a solid 4 in an attempt to jump into the tree, she hits the ground, the foot retracts and its owner promptly skedaddles.  We hear the impact, go in to investigate, and learn that someone else had been watching the camp.  Chase ensues.  Eventually, they make a misstep, and we find them.  Sitting in a tree above our heads is a dwarf dressed head to toe in a chicken suit.  The Paladin's player begins laughing, and explains the origin of this character.  Long ago, before I joined the group, the Paladin's player had a Rogue who frequented bars, and had once met a Dwarf drowning his sorrows.  As it turns out, the Dwarf's entire family had been killed by a giant chicken, and in an odd case of Quisling psychology, went insane and began to emulate a chicken.  Jumping to the present day, three people stand before a Dwarf in a chicken suit speaking only Chicken, which we discovered when our interrogations prompted no response beyond clucking.  The bard then cast Tongues on both herself and me, so we now knew Chicken.  However, the spell was misinterpreted, so instead of *speaking* it, as was the goal, we simply understood what the man was saying.  In response, the Paladin cast Speak with Animals, and could now communicate with the Chicken Man.  Asking him what he was doing, he responded that he was just hanging out in the woods, and was watching the hunting party from the tree we first found him in.  We asked if he knew about the bandits, and he replied in that \"maybe, maybe not\" way that signified he wanted to be compensated for this information.  And with this, an idea struck me.  From a previous, relatively normal quest, I had just reached level 5, gaining access to level 3 spells.  Seeing as we had 9 mouths to feed and no decent supply of income, I prepared Create Food and Water, to even out our diet.  Due to the Quaker Oats video circulating our group, and what I was picturing in my head, we decided that the 45 pounds of bland, nourishing food was oatmeal.  So, as all this went through my head, I cast Create Food and Water, and 45 pounds of oatmeal plopped into existence.  Chicken Man was practically salivating.  The Paladin told him it was all his, if he told us where to find the bandits.  He distractedly told us where to find them, and with consent, leaped into the oatmeal with joy, and started making oatmeal angels.  As we went on our merry, we looked back one last time, and briefly watched the Chicken Man attempt to build an abode from the oatmeal.  Attempt.  Anyway, besides the bard almost dying (again), the bandit fight was standard fare, and we took the survivors back to the garrison for their arrest and our reward.  After we rested up, we decided to look back at the Emerald Enclave bulletin board, and we realized the awful truth of the pig poster.  But that is a story for next time.",

        "text": "&gt; \"Killing you while you're asleep? That's not my style. I'd rather kill you slowly while you're awake.\" -- G\n\nSo. Temporarily ignoring the fact that my last post here was supposed to be the 'Part One' of the 28 campaign and actually contributed nothing of value, and assuming that most of you reading this have zero idea of the source material (it's a pretty unique RP), I'll try to make this as user-friendly as possible.\n\nThe central character to this story, Lord_Bill.exe, was a somewhat glitchy digital replica of Twitch Plays Pokemon's professional supervillain, PC Overlord Bill (yes, Pokemon fans, [THAT](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Bill_anime.png) Bill). .Exe, despite being programmed to impersonate a supervillain, soon realized that what he was doing was, well, *wrong,* so he had a change of hard drive and started casting his lot with The Good Guys, which in this case means a young woman named Eureka (me) and her friends: a woman named Gadzooks, a cyber-[Zigzagoon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:263Zigzagoon.png)-ferret-raccoon-creature named Bane, and a self-loathing, somewhat depressed, and snarky disembodied Voice-spirit named Bytemite, the latter of which doesn't actually appear in this chapter but will appear in other chapters.\n\nAnd we all had an enemy that called itself G that wanted us all dead.\n\nThis is the story of how G almost got its wish in the very first session.\n\n---\n\nIt started when Eureka and \"Exxy,\" as we eventually grew to call Lord_Bill.exe so as not to freak the NPCs out, received a letter purporting to be from G:\n\n&gt; Hello, my dear 'Friend'. This is to let you know about the dangerous floor (*sic; I don't know what that means either*) you stepped in. I tried to be nice, I tried to warn you, but you will didn't do what I asked you to do, in fact, you did the opposite. My sources have told me that you're on your way to Hoenn now, big, BIG mistake. I can't guarantee that any of your friends will be safe, or survive for that matter. With nothing else to say, I bid you farewell, have 'safe' travels.\n&gt; -G\n\nExxy did what any sane digital being would have done under the circumstances: freaked out massively. Eventually, upon Eureka asking Exxy what G had asked him to do, Exxy admitted that G had given him instructions to stab her, threatened to send them both a bomb, et cetera. If a computer program could be said to hyperventilate, Exxy was most likely doing so just trying to explain it.\n\nBane the cyber-Zigzagoon, who was also listening, mentioned that he didn't remember anything up to a couple of days before. This was because up to a couple of days before, Bane had been Bane_of_Billexe, a virus designed to make Exxy's life miserable in every way possible until Exxy managed to trap it in one of its own programs and, with Gadzooks' help, reprogram it into a helpful Zigzagoon ally. For obvious reasons, nobody brought this up... except for G, of course, who tried to prod Bane into going back to his original programming (which Bane didn't remember and clearly didn't *want* to remember) so he would kill Exxy.\n\nAfter harassing pretty much every member of our party, G did... *something* off-screen, and we suddenly all woke up on a boat in the middle of some unidentifiable ocean in the Pokemon world. Exxy was in a human body (still resembling Evil Overlord Bill), Bane was in a Zigzagoon body, and Gadzooks had been turned into... an [Unown-T.](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:UnownT.png) A floating, hovering, tiny Unown-T, after some debate with the GM (who was playing G) over whether Gadzooks had gone from human to Unown or the other way around. And there were [Sharpedos](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:319Sharpedo.png) circling the boat. (Before anyone asks, no, Sharpedos are not pedos; they're the more well-publicized type of predator that will Eat You Alive. Which is arguably worse.)\n\nThe crew of the boat appeared to be completely ignoring us, even when Bane tried to steal a crew member's hat. G explained that they weren't holograms or anything, they just couldn't see us. Which was probably a good thing, given that Exxy looked exactly like a known war criminal overlord that was wanted for every crime but prostitution, but it still freaked us all out at the time. \n\nExxy and Bane were shocked to find themselves in living, breathing bodies. Gadzooks was shocked to find herself an Unown. Eureka was shocked at being kidnapped onto a boat in the middle of nowhere without her medications. Exxy quickly discovered that he was now capable of being seasick. G was teasingly shipping Eureka and Exxy over the ship's intercom in-between making threats to kill us. Exxy insisted that he hadn't done anything to anybody this time, which led him to realize that \"this time\" sounded like incriminating evidence pointing to *last* time. (He was after all a Bill.)\n\nAnd after casually name-dropping over the intercom that a \"gruesome incident\" recently happened with Eureka's family, G remotely exploded one of the boat's turbines.\n\nThe boat shook, throwing some nameless NPCs into the water to be eaten by Sharpedo. Water started rushing into the broken boat, and Exxy, acting completely on impulse, immediately scooped up Eureka and a life jacket and made a mad dash for the lifeboat. Unfortunately, life jackets make poor armor against Sharpedo, which can tear apart a supertanker. Also unfortunately, the autopilot was set on the lifeboat and the switch was broken.\n\nGadzooks and Bane also made it on the lifeboat, although Bane had his tail bitten off by a [Carvahna](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:318Carvanha.png) (AKA baby Sharpedo). Zooks tried to use Unown's only move, Hidden Power, on the lifeboat's motor. There was some discussion over whether Zook's Hidden Power should be Ghost or Fairy, which in retrospect was ridiculous because 1. the GM, as the one who turned Zooks into an Unown, was the one with the right to decide, and 2. there is no Fairy-type Hidden Power in Pokemon.\n\nG's voice came from the lifeboat speakers, taunting us about our imminent death and teasing Eureka about how \"the moment's right\" to kiss Exxy. Eureka (me), who had *not* been having a fun time being jerked around all day and most certainly did NOT want to see her friends die, decided Heck With It. Turning to poor Exxy, she said, \"Look, I still think you're creepy, and rude, and possibly still conceited and all that, and don't take this as a confession of love, but if THIS keeps that dratted autopilot from killing us all--\" And then kissed Exxy on the cheek. \n\nIt wasn't a romantic kiss... until he repaid the favor on her lips.\n\nThe romantic moment was instantly ground to a halt when Bane brought up that we were making out while he was bleeding. Exxy quickly bandaged Bane's tail stump with fabric ripped off of his necktie, insisting that \"we're gonna be fine.\" Except that the ship was heading for the Sharpedo, which meant that we were probably *not* going to be 'fine,' we were going to be dinner.\n\nZooks tried to fire Hidden Power at the Sharpedos, but being level one, she wasn't very good at lowering their health. Exxy yelled at Zooks to save whoever she could and let him go down with the ship. Zooks, unfortunately, was by no means large enough to carry Eureka, and could only *barely* carry Bane. Exxy was starting to shiver from the cold and the seawater. Bane was firing Tri Attacks at the Sharpedos, a move Zigzagoon normally can't learn, but in Twitch Plays Pokemon we had a randomized Zigzagoon that knew it, so Bane knew it as well.\n\nIn the middle of the confusion, Exxy ripped out the wires connecting the autopilot to the boat's motor, a choice which we would live to regret.\n\nZooks went back to using Hidden Power on the lifeboat motor, but unfortunately she was still only level one and she only had 15 PP for the move. Bane offered himself as shark bait so that Zooks could psychically lift Exxy and Eureka out, which wasn't feasible for Zooks to do and thus never happened. Zooks, having run out of Hidden Power PP, suggested that Exxy use her newly paddle-shaped body as an oar. Bane burst out laughing at this, but also suggested that he be an oar as well, which just goes to show you how desperate we were.\n\nExxy came up with a new plan: use Zooks as an oar, and have Bane use Tri Attack on the water to try to move the boat faster. Never mind that there was no land in sight and we were basically stalling for time at this point. Exxy, meanwhile, was desperately trying to lighten the lifeboat's load by pulling apart the autopilot and throwing the pieces overboard. Unfortunately, we hadn't remembered that Bane the randomized Zigzagoon knew Growth as well, or else things might have gone entirely different for us.\n\nAt the end, the GM gave us ten minutes to solve the problem before a complete party wipe. *Ten minutes.* And our options, at that point, were pretty much all terrible.\n\nIn the end, we had to have all our butts all saved at the very last minute (literally the last minute) by another roleplayer that was late to the party, Agent 006, a female level 93 [Bibarel](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:400Bibarel.png) who used Superpower to beat up the Sharpedo and then towed us back to dry land. Eureka and Exxy had an adorably awkward moment together, in which Eureka made it clear that Exxy was *not* going to try to kiss her like that again, and Exxy, being Exxy, asked her how she'd prefer him to kiss her.\n\nG's voice came up back on the lifeboat's loudspeaker, saying, \"Well! Wasn't that FUN?\" To which Eureka had nothing polite to say back. Exxy was somewhat nervous about speaking to an International Police agent like 006, as Exxy looked an awful lot like Public Enemy No. 1 Bill MacKenzie. The Agent reassured him that she wasn't here to arrest him, she was investigating G's actions.\n\nSo after the roleplay, out of character, Zooks asked the GM just how they could have avoided death *without* Agent 006's intervention, to which the GM replied... that Zooks should've used her Hidden Power on *the autopilot itself,* to change the direction of the lifeboat motor.\n\nExcept that Exxy had already cut the connection with the autopilot. And then tried to throw the autopilot into the water.\n\nExxy's response? \"I feel like an idiot now.\"\n\nThe GM's response? \"Oh, don't worry, Bill, you *are* an idiot!\"\n\nAnd this is why we can't have nice things.\n",

        "text": "So, in a group on Roll20, there is a game that has nine players that have never all been on at the same time.  We sleep a boat, and switch between goofing around and joking about memes, to doing random quests we find on bulletins and bounty boards.  This story involves a Human War Cleric (myself), a Dragonborn Berzerker, and a human Oath of the Ancient Paladin, and we felt like doing something with our lives.  In the city we spend the majority of our time (mostly because our stolen pirate ship is too damaged to leave harbor), there is a chapter of the Emerald Enclave, which most of us are a part of, which is where one of the bulletin boards is.  We check for any quests, and we see a poster for a child's lost pig (a story for another time), and an advert for the Explorers' Guild.  We said \"Why not?\" and at around 2 o'clock, we went to the address listed, which was a small, run-down home with a simple sign reading \"Explorers' Guild\" above the cellar.  Upon entering, we find... nothing.  It was a dark, barren cellar that housed an empty table and some empty wine casks.  Confused, we go out and knock on the house door, and ask if the owner, a human male nearing his sixties, knew about the sign.  When he did not, we showed him, he took it down, locked the cellar, thanked us, and bid us good day.  We returned to the Emerald Enclave, and told the man at the desk, Rarder, that the advert was false.  He said we weren't exactly credible resources yet, so we took him to the address we just came from... to find an empty plot of land.  Needless to say, we were flabbergasted and at least a little bashful that we just dragged a man halfway across town for nothing.  We head back, and I look at the address from the advert.  It had changed to a new one on the other side of town.  On a hunch, we give Rarder a piece of paper with the address listed, write one down for ourselves, and head out.  We encounter an eerily-similar abode, with the same sign hanging above the cellar.  We go in, and we find an inverted but otherwise identical cellar.  Knocking on the door, we find a man who looks like a younger version of the man we talked to at the previous house.  Same interaction, he takes the sign down, locks the cellar, and bids us good day.  We go back to the Enclave, go and get Rarder, and bring him to the new address.  To an empty plot of land.  Again.  Just plain embarrassed now, we start walking back, with Rarder telling us he's done running across town for empty plots.  Then it clicks for us, and we all check the addresses we wrote down.  They had changed back to the first.  Rarder's curiosity was piqued, yet not enough to keep running around, so we promised to tell him any additional information.  Two real-life hours later, we all on separate occasions managed to get ourselves locked in inter-dimensional cellars, discover that both their names are Bill Darby, discover that every time the houses switch, they lose the memories of previous exchanges, and that the houses only switch when Rarder walks out the front door of the Enclave (which means we kept having to run over to the Enclave and get the poor guy to step out the front door repeatedly).  We were gradually beginning to realize that there is some powerful magic effect that is transporting these houses and its contents back and forth the Ethereal Plane and wiping Bill's memories.  So, in order to streamline the encounters and make our story a bit more believable, we get both of them to write down something only they would know on a piece of paper.  Coincidentally, this confirmed that Young Bill (as we had taken to calling to calling him) actually *was* young Bill, who had been a gem cutter until he retired years ago.  Eventually, we hatch a plan.  We get Rarder to come outside, switch the house to Young Bill, and bring him over, thus showing this guy a house for the first time in five hours.  We take the both of them to the wizards tower in the city, and find out that the Bills aren't real; they were Ethereal the entire time, and if we had made contact with them, we could have figured that out.  Switching back to Old Bill, we decided as a group that \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" and we let the Ghost Houses of Bill Darby become part of the town mythos.  We put up a sign on the bulletin saying that the Explorers' Guild is not accepting any new applicants, vowed to put this on the backburner until we could figure out who or what was doing/did this, and moved on to kill some bandits and meet a chicken man.  But that is a story for next time.",

        "text": "Derrick was my first true character. I had characters before him but none that I remember fondly, for before him I would consider myself a bad player.  Yet through Derrick I turned it around and made perhaps one of the best characters I have ever seen.  I may post more as my D&amp;D itch grows stronger, without a game to play in, but till then here’s how he went from a silent imbecile to a man with a destiny laid before him.\n\nThrough OC drama, the party split in two, with the dm running a session for the rp focused players, and a session for the combat focused players. There was more to it but that’s the easiest explanation.\nAnyway, now a party of 2 (after 1 session it went to a party size of 4), headed towards a dungeon designed for 5 players.  We had 2, Derrick the idiot fighter doing what he believed was right, and Serah, a fragile wizard falsely accused of necromancy.  So off we went following a rumour about a dragon’s horde lying in an abandoned keep.\n\nWe first hit trouble upon entering the keep itself. Up until that point it was calm due to all focus being on the city under siege.  Within the keep we met a dragon.  A huge blue scaled beast, whose eyes shot to us as we snuck in.  Perhaps on that day lady luck shined on us, for the dragon unknown to us, needed our help. For below all her treasure deep in the vaults, was what she most desired, however warded against dragons. \n\nWe were only all too eager to accept her trade.  Unlock and enter the vault, retrieve the amulet that she wanted and we could walk away with our lives, and any other treasure we should find in the vaults.  What a generous offer, especially coming from a dragon, yet with hindsight an offer that should have been refused, even if death was the alternative.\n\nSo after a few riddles and a game of pull that lever and hope it doesn’t kill us we were into the vault.  Now it’s a vault designed for 5 people not because of the challenge but what was inside.  5 magic items designed so that each party member would pick up one.  However, we had 2 people, and Serah know what these items did so boldly encouraged me to go ahead and pick them all up.  \n\nHere’s a question for all you fine gentlemen.  What happens when 1 person holds a band of dragon binding, forcing allegiance to the dragon priests. A crown, with a mad king’s mind trapped inside, who has the added bonus of a hatred of dragons, and then to top it all off a halberd. Now the halberds the catalyst hear. At first glance it’s just a halberd of dragon bane.  Yet its more.  Most importantly, 2 minds are trapped inside this halberd from the long ago dragon war, and to no-ones surprise, one being the high priest of the dragon church and the other being a general leading the armies against such ideologies that the dragon priests have. \n\nThis was it, the moment that changed my D&amp;d career, one roll would decide my fate.  I passed, the dragon priest won, sending my crown flying across the room, and muting his compatriot trapped inside within the halberd.  Thus my destiny lay before me, release the high priest from his cage and bring about the 4th dragon war.  \n\nI still kept the crown though, for it was a pretty hat.  \n\n(Feedback on writing appreciated, and Ill write more if you guys want me to) ",

        "text": "LAST TIME, On Anima... you know, just check my post history for last time, a recap would put me over the limit.  Let's get into it!\n\n**Characters**\n\n**Albert Rickard (PC)** - The self-styled Demon King, who has just assumed his moniker.  No longer human, now a Chimaera Warlock of immense magical and physical power, Albert has decided he's going to rule one way or another.\n\n**Cecilia Rickard (NPC)** - Albert's 'wife,' created via a combination of magic spells.  An giant of a woman, monstrously powerful and loyal to death.  A Warrior of extreme prowess with her greatsword.\n\n**Matthew Revale (PC)** - Albert's 'best friend,' who may at this point just be in it to see how far everything can go.  A warrior/summoner hybrid martial artist, he was truly about to demonstrate how powerful he was.  Accompanying him were his familiars - a light elemental martial artist named **Anna**, and a psychic fairy named **Zoe**.\n\n**Selene (PC)** A daimah (demihuman) thief/warrior/magician hybrid with a penchant for aikido.  Short, adorable, and as we were all going to discover soon, extremely bloodthirsty.\n\n**Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde (NPCs)** - A group of prinny homunculi created by Albert to carry stuff for him.  Blue, Yellow, Pink, and Black in color.\n\n**The Story**\n\nAs we left off, battle was about to commence between Albert and Co. and the combined forces of the Lord of Remo's royal guard and two members of the holy inquisition of Gaia.  Let the massacre begin.\n\nDice were rolled, zeon began to be gathered, spells began to fly in every direction.  Selene created an illusory fire that was so real to a few men they threw themselves off the balcony trying to extinguish the blaze, Matt, Anna, and Cecilia dived in punching and swinging, Albert was firing destruction spells off like crazy, psychic shields erupted into being, and even the prinnies went in.\n\nNow, a fun thing about prinnies - when they are thrown through the air and impact the ground, they explode.  Mostly, this was thematic in nature throughout the game, because the GM did not want to give me nearly unlimited grenades.  In this fight, two of them made the ultimate sacrifice.  Inky and Blinky charged in, got batted through the air, landed ON THE LORD OF REMO, and detonated.  So the ruler was no more, but there were still a pair of heavily armed inquisitors, and about 6 knights.\n\nCreation magic blazed up, and walls upon walls within walls sealed off the room, leaving the fight isolated.  However, the inquisitors were MORE than holding their own.  Matt cried out, saying that \"we need to deal with this quickly, if reinforcements start showing up and breaking down the barriers then we'll be overwhelmed!\"  Al agreed and started to charge a spell while the melee ensued.  Something to note at this point is that despite his prodigious shielding ability (Creation has the strongest shields of any book of magic,) Albert refused to protect anyone other than himself or Cecilia.  This will be relevant later.\n\nThe fight went another two or three rounds, and we were on the losing foot of it.  The inquisitors were STRONG, and the number of enemies was beginning to take a toll.  In Anima, multiple defenses cause cumulative defensive penalties, meaning that the more you have to block, the less likely it is you will block.  With Matt and Cecilia having to stop 3-4 attacks per round, and the inquisitors delaying their turns so they'd get the biggest swings in, we were starting to suffer. \n\nThen Albert acted.  He aimed his hand at the female inquisitor, the younger and more inexperienced of the two, and went to cast.  The GM took that moment to remind me (in a most smarmy way) that Inquisitors had MASSIVE magic resistance bonuses, meaning that any control spell was likely to fail.\n\n\"That's okay.  This spell has no resist.\"  Albert cast Chimaera at it's second level of power on the inquisitor.  The holy knight, sworn to protect gaia from supernatural abominations, immediately grew tremendous wings that broke through her armor, monstrous claws and fangs, developed an intense thirst for blood and human flesh, and had her appearance warped.  The GM was mortified, because for a holy knight to fall that far in the blink of an eye, there would only be one IC response she could make.\n\nShe took her own life instantly, rather than feed the insatiable hunger she then felt.\n\nWith that inquisitor out of the fight, it turned quickly.  Cecilia was freed up to join Matt in battle with the elder, and the two of them working in unison began to wear him down.  Finally, Matt revealed one of his newest talents.  He had finally acquired the ability to use ki, and he was about to use it well.\n\n\"SHINKUUKEN!\"  Matt roared and unleashed a powerful strike at the Inquisitor.  His fingertips touched the man's chest, and there was a bright flash of light and energy as something exploded.  The Shinkuuken was a ki dominion technique (Anima terminology for \"super move,\") that gave a good bonus to the attack roll, doubled the damage of the strike, and made it so if you could not stop supernatural damage, you could not defend yourself against the attack.  Well, lucky for the inquisitor, he could defend himself, so he stood a chance.\n\nI say stood a chance, because Matt decided to open roll.  TWICE.  two mid-90s rolls, plus the bonus, plus his base attack meant this would probably be the end of the fight, and the end it was.  That explosion of energy tore out most of the old man's chest, and he died on the spot.\n\nSo we did the only thing we could.  We stole the artifact weapons of the Inquisitors, the 'Lawbringers,' then we stole the female's body, and Matt (with his spiritual magic powers) stole her soul and put her in storage, and stole most of the Lord's belongings.  Then we threw up a psychic illusion, and GTFO-ed the palace.  In order to take this place, we were going to need a new plan.\n\nLuckily, our chance at a new plan came in a day or so.  Using his summon powers, Matt fixed the female inquisitor.  How?  The holy Arcana.\n\nIn Anima, summoners are capable of three feats: Summoning (which involves calling and binding a creature to fight with you for awhile,) Invoking (which involves calling an 'aeon' temporarily to perform a great and powerful feat, in exchange for offering a pact to it,) and Incarnating (which involves calling the spirit of a great warrior to inhabit your body for awhile and loan you their strength.) \n\nThe Arcana, based on the various tarot cards, were all Invocations.  They cost a TON of zeon, but they did something amazing.  In this case, Matt invoked The Death.  \n\nNow, when he pacted The Death, that was amusing, because The Death will only obey someone who has faced death and brought themselves back.  Basically, he had to enter the 'dying' state and make the various physical saves to come back.  \"Hey Al.\"  \"Yeah?\"  \"Stab me.\"  \n\nExpected response: \"You sure?\"\n\nActual response: \"K.\" *STAB.*\n\nMatt had succeeded, and acquired The Death.  Death's power was absolute, it would undo ANY physical damage or imperfection to a living creature.  So he put the female inquisitor's soul back into her body, and had Death touch her.  The Chimaera spell was reversed, her injuries were healed, and she sat up... and realized she was alone, in Al's camp, surrounded.  She surrendered.\n\nAt this point, Al asked for the room, and set about 'persuading' her to help them.  It involved a lot of really dark magic spells that stimulated various emotions and sensations, so I'll let you all do the math on what transpired.  (NOTE: There was no non-con sexual contact at any point over the course of this game.  We do not approve, and we do not condone that.)\n\n24 hours later, she spilled the beans.  They had psychically contacted the inquisition to send help, which meant in a week or so Remo would be crawling with them.  As well, they would be temporarily annexing Remo to root out Lord Blackthorne.  \"Excellent.\"  Al knew he could use this.\n\nWith that, the inquisitioner was dismissed.  We knew she couldn't go back, she'd lost her weapon and been shamed.  They'd kill her on sight.  She seemed like a nice enough girl, so Al recommended a house in Archangel, the main city of Abel, that we knew was abandoned (because we owned it.)  Al basically gained Karma, and the world let out a sigh that somewhere in him, there was goodness.\n\n\"So what's the plan, Al?\"  Selene was curious, as was, well, everyone else (except Pinky and Clyde, who were still mourning the loss of Inky and Blinky.)  Al explained it.\n\n\"The Inquisition will usurp a lot of power from the local lord, and essentially seize control of the country.  Most of the Remo Army will wind up falling in with them, because the newly appointed Princess (The lord had no male sons left) will bend the knee.  But Remo isn't a gynarchy, if they had a male heir to follow then they'd do so.\"  \n\n\"But there isn't a male heir.\"\n\n\"Yet.\"\n\nAl's plan was simple enough if you had the ability to alter minds... which he did.  First, we waited a week for the inquisition to arrive (which they did.  IN LARGE NUMBERS.)\n\nWe kidnapped some 12 year old peasant boy, cleaned him up, altered his hair and eyes to be more right, destroyed his memories of his current life, and rebuilt them; he became the bastard son of the previous ruler, and therefore the trueborn heir to the throne of Remo.  How could he prove this?  The signet ring his father had given his mother (that we'd lifted off his corpse.)\n\nThus, \"Lord Blackthorne\" made sure rumors began to circulate that the trueborn heir to the throne was under his protection, but soon he would emerge to take back his country from the inquisition.  \n\nNext we rode east with the boy, to one of Remo's main military fortresses, and presented the boy to Remo's second highest general.  She looked at him, and she saw all the signs of his father's bloodline.  She swore fealty on the spot, and said that when the time came, they would stand alongside him, and Blackthorne (who graciously agreed to advise the boy.)\n\nAt this point, Al said \"fuck it,\" and created another living, ensouled being with all his ambitions and magical knowledge, but a different set of memories.  He created Blackthorne as a separate entity, because he needed people to NOT believe they were the same person.  Also, the ability to basically be in two places at once was fantastic.\n\nA few days later, the call to arms went out wide; the true child lord of Remo was coming, and Blackthorne was backing him.  We rode to the gates of the city, met the army of the inquisition and the army of Remo, and a good 70% of the Remo army promptly defected to what they viewed as their true lord.  We settled in for a siege.\n\nAnd by that, I mean we decided we were ending things the next day.  That night, MANY spells were cast.  When the GM asked me what, I replied by writing down a list of things on a piece of paper, folding up the piece of paper, and placing it on the table.  \"This is my grand scheme for the battle.  In order for this to work right, literally no one else, not even you, sir, can be aware of how this plan works.  But there will be no adjustment on the fly, it's all contingent on the plan I've placed here.\"  Interested in where this was going, the GM let it fly and opted not to open the paper.\n\nThe next day, the battle erupted in earnest.  Selene used illusion magic to get herself behind enemy lines and into a position to open the main gates, which she did while we charged.  The fight through the city was brutal and many lives were lost, but soon we had crossed the city and invaded the throne room again.\n\nThis time we found a high inquisitor waiting for us, with two of his finest.  We had Matt + familiars, Al (in persona as Blackthorne), Selene, Cecilia, and the Remo General helping us.  Initiative was rolled, and the fight began.  The Remo general took up position in front of \"Blackthorne,\" as the GM had given us her to control, and she was a FAR better physical fighter than Albert was.  Cecilia engaged one inquisitor with Selene, and Matt and Anna took on the other.  The General would hold the high inquisitor at bay for a few turns (we hoped.)\n\nLucky us, the inquisitor needed a couple of turns to get his weapon going.  He had a unique Lawbringer known as the equilibrium, a POWERFUL artifact that negated the penalties for multiple defenses entirely.  In other words, it negated our strength - numbers!  However, he had to get it shifted into the proper form first (it was a variable weapon that could change into any type of weapon given time.)\n\nThose couple of turns were spent dispatching one of the inquisitors via a critically failed defense (a 'fumble' in anima terms,) and Al was just charging zeon like it was going out of style.  Finally, the high inquisitor made his move, and advanced.  Go Remo General!\n\nHe swung once, and she soared across the room.  Withstand Pain check (a skill) to make sure she remained conscious, and she did.  No Remo General!  The inquisitor advanced on 'Blackthorne.'\n\n\"I know your secret, 'Blackthorne,' and it's time you and your ambitions were ended here!  DIE, RICKARD!\"  The Inquisitor lifted Equilibrium high in the air, dice were rolled...\n\nAnd he impaled him clean through the chest.  With a roar, he hefted 'Blackthorne' high into the air, over his head, holding him on the blade.  Cecilia screamed in pain, Selene screamed in terror, Matt screamed in rage... and across the table, I started laughing.\n\nThe impaled Blackthorne looked down at the high inquisitor from over his head, opened his mouth... \"Wrong one, d00d!\"  He transformed into a prinny, and fell, impacting the ground heavily at the high inquisitor's feet.  KABOOM.\n\nAt this point, I tossed the paper to the GM, and he opened it.\n\nStep 1: Metamorphosis, transforming a prinny into Blackthorne.\n\nStep 2: Metamorphosis, transforming myself into the general.\n\nStep 3: Metamorphosis, transforming actual Blackthorne into me, allowing him to command the battle in my place.\n\nStep 4: The boss will probably prioritize 'me,' which is exactly what I want.  I must keep \"the general\" close to \"blackthorne\" so that no one can tell that it isn't him gathering zeon, but that it's her.\n\nStep 5: Strike when the prinny explodes.\n\nI lightly paraphrased that, but that was basically what was written.  I had disguised us the night before and told NO one else in the group of the plan.\n\nAs soon as the prinny exploded, the \"Remo General\" leapt up and let the metamorphosis spell go, changing back into Al and unleashing the full power Greater Mystic Bolt he had been charging the entire time.  (The withstand pain check, made using Al's stats, also doubled as a \"do I lose all the gathered zeon\" check.  I didn't.)  \n\nCombine the defensive penalties for being surprised and being attacked from behind, and this was EASY to hit.  The high inquisitor roared in pain as the spell tore into him, inflicting a massive penalty because of the damage.\n\nCecilia swung next, and riding the penalty, she made a called shot and with an open roll managed to slam the point of her greatsword into the high inquisitor's left eye, destroying it and raising his penalties to the maximum possible under the game mechanics.  \n\nFinally, it was Matt.  \"Don't blink... SHINKUUKEN!\"  His target was the other eye.  He blew it straight out of the inquisitor's head, and did enough damage to kill him.  The inquisitor fell, we took Equilibrium, and turned to the last inquisitor.\n\n\"Go back to your masters, dog.  Speak of the mercy of Blackthorne, and that this is the fate of those who oppose!  He shall wander blind for all eternity, unable to find his way to absolution!\"  And Albert laughed as he finished speaking.  The inquisitor RAN like the wind.\n\nThe battle was ended, the child lord was placed on the throne, and Blackthorne agreed to stay and advise the child on how to rule for the time.  Now the group set their sights on the rest of the Azur Alliance, knowing that soon they would contest Matthew Gaul, the High Archon of the Azur, and possibly the only man on Gaia whose intelligence came close to rivaling Albert.\n\n\"And how do we defeat him?  They have superior numbers, and this time we won't have a tactical advantage.\"  Matt spoke honestly.  \n\n\"We eliminate the numbers advantage.\"  Al's response was curt.\n\n\"How?\"  \"That's easy.  We take more.\"  \"We can't take more of the Azur.\"  \"Did I say the Azur?\"  Albert gestured to a world map, indicating the New Continent to the west that was primarily barbarian tribes, with a few bright spots of civilization and the frozen north territories of Goldar... which were mostly Viking-style nations and tribes.\n\n\"We'll unite the two.  Blackthorne and the men we have can easily hold Remo.  The mountain ranges surrounding us and the ocean mean that Gaul and the rest of the Azur could only approach from a few directions.  And Gaul won't be able to move his whole army anyway, if his northern border weakens then Elisabetta can easily bring the Abel army in and deal with him.\"\n\n\"So, what, we go and become the lords of the west and the north?  That will take forever.\"\n\n\"You're right.  So we have Selene become queen of the tribes on the new continent, and you and I go north.  Literally half the time.  We'll bring the northern tribes to the new continent, unite with the tribes there, and bring everyone under one flag.\"\n\n\"Won't a conquest like that take far too long?\"\n\n\"It would if I was planning on conquering.  I'm not.  I want to bring them into one coalition, united under one rule.  The Black Rose of Blackthorne will soon fly over the new continent.\"\n\nThus, plans were made, ships were constructed, and the group prepared to split up.  However, first Albert dove deep into his studies of the occult, and magic, and because of his stupid level of magic mastery he was able to almost instantaneously master the magical sub-path known as Time magic.\n\nSee, in order to forge a truly magical weapon, EXTREMELY high skill checks are needed.  Now, having proper resources, such as materials, help, a workspace, and years upon years to work with give bonuses to the check.  Well, infinite creatures to sacrifice via creation, (materials,) an army of prinnies (help,) a great workshop made via creation (workspace,) and a localized time loop in which years passed in the blink of an eye (years upon years to work with,) meant Albert had everything he needed.\n\nHe took his Wife's greatsword, his own sword, the female inquisitioner's sword, and the elder male inquisitioner's circlet into his workshop.  When he emerged a day later, he had several journals with him, and four great and powerful artifacts.\n\nHe had reforged his sword into what he called \"The Blade of the Demon King.\"  It gave bonuses to his magic powers, a bonus against psychic attacks, and by swinging it he could unleash an energy blast at will that had a predefined attack value (which meant he never rolled attack, they just rolled defense.)\n\nHis wife's sword became \"The Blade of the Demon Queen.\"  It gave her massive bonuses to strength and damage, and cut through most armor like it didn't exist.  As well, it had a great chance on hit of just crippling the victim.\n\nThe inquisitor's sword became \"The Sword of the Night Queen,\" which he gave to Selene.  He had perverted the power of the lawbringer, which had previously burst into flame if it came in contact with supernatural blood.  Now human blood caused that reaction, and if any human tried to grip the hilt it would erupt in spikes and rend their hand useless.  It also acquired the Vorpal quality, meaning it had a 90% lower penalty for called shots to the neck, and gave a bonus to the chance to just decapitate the victim.\n\nAs Matt refused a gift (again, human, principles, etc,) Al forged the circlet into \"The Demon's Crown,\" which gave MASSIVE magic bonuses, and basically immunity to psychic attacks to the wearer.\n\n\"What's with the journals?\"\n\n\"I've been in there for 400 years.  These are the records of everything I did, because I had to keep reverting my own timestream to earlier points so that I wouldn't die.  I kept forgetting what I'd already done, so I started these so I would remember.\"  (Time magic is a HELL of a thing.)\n\nWith their new armaments, the group split up.  Cecilia stayed with Blackthorne to guard the home front (also we figured it would keep GM bullshittery to a minimum if we left some of the OP behind.)  Albert and Matthew boarded a flying bird Al had made to take them to the north, and Selene boarded one heading west.  The three set off, flying in different directions, their paths splitting for now, but soon they would reunite for one grand, final battle together...\n\nAnd that's where we'll leave this one off for now.  Longer than I wanted it to be.  The next chapter, \"Conquest of the north,\" will be up later today. (I'm at work.  Got nothing better to do.)  It should be much shorter, but hopefully just as entertaining.  I hope you're all enjoying, feel free to leave feedback!",

        "text": "We were prosperous once. Our colonies stretched from wilds of the Irjamma Frontier to the border with the Rethellian Republic, our merchants having visited every port in the land. It was a golden age for humanity, a time when the United Nations of Earth was a name that carried respect and hope. But in our decadence, we grew complacent.\n\nThe Outer Rim surveillance array had been all but forgotten. The pet project of an ambitious senator from decades ago. It had fallen into disrepair, and manning became it a punishment for our navy's delinquents. Imagine our surprise when it began to receive a transmission. They were like echoes, eerie and ominous, waves inexplicably lapping against the shore of a placid lake. Day after day, this garbled transmission continued... it was getting closer.\n\nNow the admiralty bristled. There were whispers of deploying the fleet, though such an action had not been taken in years, not since the invasion of Irjamma, a fiasco the U.N.E. was eager to forget. It was not until the transmission, so long in coming, finally unscrambled that action was taken, even if it was too late.\n\nSix locations were pinpointed, one on the border of the Icarus Sector, the others out into the frontier, meaningless points in empty space. In those locations, gravity wells of immense size formed, the same as you'd expect from a warp drive, only these were astronomically more powerful. At the same time they appeared, we saw them for the first time... we saw *it* for the first time. A mass of grotesque tissue, organic pylons all around it with an eye at the center. Its \"voice\" echoed throughout the chamber in which it was housed, completely unintelligible by our translator. We tried to communicate with it, sending back greetings in every cataloged language, with every imaginable variety of sensory output. But in the back of our minds, we knew they did not care for diplomacy. So we deployed our mighty fleet to meet this invader from another place, and it became a waiting game.\n\nWengzhou was the nearest colony to their predicted incursion. Evacuation had begun, and the navy was sending out scouting parties into the frontier to withdraw scientific research teams investigating pre-warp civilizations that lived in the frontier. Admiral Sidney, a peacetime armchair admiral, led the fleet. And though he'd never been in so much as a skirmish himself, even he fear their preparedness. The fleet was outdated, anybody could see that. In fact, three of the vessels, Imawanto-class ships, were in service before the formation of the Interplanetary Confederation, some 70 years ago. Frequently, he was forced to push such thoughts aside. This was all they had.\n\nThe day they arrived, the day The Swarm first met us toe to toe, was a dark day for the U.N.E. Admiral Sidney's fleet was met with a vanguard of biological ships, armed with deadly missiles that, upon penetrating the armor of a vessel, released a deadly toxin into the atmosphere, killing the crew that was unfortunate enough to be exposed to it. The battle raged for weeks, the enemy attacking with a disturbing lack of concern for their own casualties. By the time the dust settled, the navy having been pushed back to the point that the clash became visible at night on Wengzhou, every ship in the entire U.N.E. navy had been blooded. Admiral Sidney was dead, there was not a single battle-ready capital ship left, and panic was now spreading amongst the civilian populace. But we had triumphed, or so we thought.\n\nIn the coming months, as we began to rebuild, sightings of another fleet were reported, this time on the other side of the frontier, on the border of our allies, the Imarrians. In time, these reports were not only verified, but our worst fears came true: The Swarm infested several fringe colonies. No contact could be established with the enemy, nor surviving colonists, if there were any. The Imarrian Navy was simply too weak to resist them, and soon they buckled. It was only the intervention of the Cynurians that saved the Imar Kingdom from utter destruction, and even they were being stretched thin. The Milky Way was under full invasion, but as luck would have it, the U.N.E. was devising a plan.\n\nPresident Waiters had long been planning to upgrade the fleet, and had been working in the preceding months on devising a new breed of battleship, to make the U.N.E. Navy the strongest in the galaxy. Working with our allies the Rethellians, on April 4th, 2301, Federation Day, the first Dominion-class battleship left dry dock in orbit around the colony on Porto Salvo. Commanded by the infamous Admiral Wings of Honeydew, an Imarrian born on Earth, the *Thrace* became the flagship of the Navy, known throughout the galaxy as the ship that crossed the T at the Battle of Vok's Citadel, that traded blow for blow with a Swarm Queen at point blank range at the Battle of the Korvax Veil, and finally, for being present when Admiral Wings of Honeydew delivered a message to President Waiters that the Swarm had been completely eradicated from the Milky Way.\n\nDuring the ten year campaign, other heroes emerged. The Zaanami Admiral Wainwright became the first full fledged Zaanami admiral in the history of the Navy, made legendary for defending a wounded Cynur fleet from a Swarm attack squadron. Admiral Wings of Black, the captain of a Fazio-class cruiser, led a fleet to a phyrric victory after his admiral was killed in the opening blows of a lopsided match with the Swarm.\n\nIn the end, victory was achieved, but only at the immense loss of life. Never in the history of the galaxy has such a destructive conflict raged, nor will it ever again, not if the U.N.E. has anything say about it. The galaxy breathed a collective sigh of relief. Peace had been restored.",

Coraim tried to relate to Eramil, saying he too is a trickster, except his tricks usually involve burning things or slitting people's throats. It  was then when Iaghar began making various animal noises, such as mooing, and running towards Eramil with his pants off to distract him I guess. When a beam of energy began to move towards his genitals Iaghar quickly made it clear he was just joking... and then showed he learned nothing by mooning Eramil. A magical bolt of energy unsurprisingly went, as Deadpool would put it, [right up main street](http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_281,w_499/t_mp_quality_gif/zn5nv2ersuzckxfyqglz/relive-deadpool-with-the-best-gifs-from-the-film-854563.webm).\n\nAfter a while of discussing whether or not Eramil would join the revolution, the party found out that none of the versions of him surrounding him were real, and he is too ashamed to show his face, so he uses illusions while being invisible. He came off as a real wimp, lots of crying about how no one would ever love him. Eventually we convinced him to show himself, and he was badly burned. Coraim asked if it was just his face or if other body parts were affected too (they were and apparently it's weird to ask that now). Eramil explained that when he escaped the lotus flower tavern the fire that the party had started had destroyed the sources of magical energy in the tavern, making his teleportation unstable and teleporting the tavern... somewhere. The unstable teleportation left him badly burned, and now he does his dealing with illusions mimicking his old self. He also explained that the yaks were \"yakfolk\" from the mountains who he was helping, they had been pushed out of their home by an orc warlord and through the hardship of their migration and how many of them were killed by the orcs, the ones we killed were the last of their kind, and the species was most likely extinct. Coraim suggested the party go on a quest to hunt down and kill any remaining yakfolk because he's a fucking genocidal maniac. \n\nAfter some discussion we decided to cast bull's strength on Iaghar while he was hugging Eramil and comforting him, and then made him snap his neck. It's OK this time because he enslaved people.\n\nEdit: I remembered how angry and guilt ridden Iaghar was after this, insisting no one loot his body and that he should be resurrected, when it got too annoying Coraim suggested they just kill Iaghar.",

The group is made of, at level 8 :\n\n* **Kronug, the Abyssal Bloodrager**, our main DPS by far\n\n* **Thorstein Igvarson, the Feral Shifter Druid**, our tank and divine caster\n\n* **Alvaro Karpelini, the White Mage Arcanist, Evangelist of Desna**, main healer, caster, skill-monkey and party face, yours truly.\n\n\nAs we enter the Five Kings Mountains, we spot a cold place that our druid finds too cold to his liking. My Harrow readings revealed that we will face a problem by a ghost of our past that is currently restless, should we decide to go this way, and, hating to leave something like this unsolved, we all decide to follow through, even if we were accompanied by two scout dwarves to clear empty the first church of Torag that they finally digged out of the Mountains and they needed our helps with some nefarious cave and stone giants. I tell them we have to make this slight turn and they agree, seeing as their only task is to lead us, as their Prince ordered them.\n\nWe encounter two frost giants, woshipping an altar of the Elemental Lord, Jisaaki (home-made, I believe), who made a pact with the druid's ancestors and his sister is currently the leader of the covenant of witches worshipping it, much to the druid's dismay, although we have already foiled 2 or 3 of her plans. The frost giants, hearing us, turn around and recognize the blood of Jisaaki's followers in the druid and start to speak to him, in Giant. I picked up the discussion for him and managed to prevent my party from attacking them on the spot, searching for some informations. They were angry that the druid, their Chosen One, did not understand them and rose with weapons in hand, doubting him, but a really nice Bluff (35, if I recall correctly) from me stopped them in their track : the druid was sent to complete his trainings for their Lord.\n\nThey are now happily preparing the altar and ask the druid to come forth and drink the frozen water, but the altar is so cold we all must make a Fort save of shiver. Only he manages it, the bloodrager fumbling and mine isn't enough, I explain to the giants that we are not as blessed as the Chosen One against the cold. He drinks and all is well, so they start by explaining me we will stay here for some months, teaching him all he must know. I explain them that we have a divine mission from Jisaaki : to steal the church of Torag and establish a temple to his divine grace. A Knowledge (Religion) and a Bluff later, we have two frost giants to help us in the dungeon (that we intend to get rid of after, anyways) and the DM is now a bit flustered as to what he can do. He strengthen the encounters in the church, add more enemies and, as such, the fights are harder but thanks to our new \"friends\", we manage to go through everything.\n\nThe last fight, an old and tired storm giant guards the last door and we stop. This giant is a good one and since the beginning we only fight stupid and chaotic evil ones. I speak to him and he cordially answers that he guards something in there, but this is not the dwarven church we are after. I explain that we killed eveyone of the other giants on the way and he is a bit disappointed but does not get mad at me, since we were only fighting evil. He changes our plans, tho, since we don't want to kill a good giant to get at something we don't know, so we tell him we'll be back with dwarves to explain him everything and he agrees, since he must guard the door anyways. The frost giants approach me and whispers that while we are gone to parley with our \"allies\" dwarves, both of them will take care of the storm giant while we wait. We didn't want them to kill the storm, but couldn't know what to do, so I ask them to wait a bit farther, while going to speak to the storm and warning him that these two will try to kill him.\n\nThe DM pauses, he looks at the stats of the frost and the storm, and call a Diplomacy check. I prevail again. He simply smiles at me and say \"Let them try\". Casting him a Protection from Evil nonetheless, I wish him good luck while we return. I ask the frost giants to wait for us, they nod and, after we have walked two meters away, simply charge the storm giant and we all cringe, turning around to help him. He raises a hand, send a chain lightning and kills them both. \n\nHe waves at us with a smile and we walk away, swearing not to mess with this guy...",

        "text": "So in my experience of only playing serious characters in all my previous roleplays I finally got to play a joke character. Jeremiah \"Old Man\" Jenkins was a batshit old coot living in 1899 england. Noone really knows what war it was that he fought in but apparently he's a commander who died for his country like any good man should. He then retired from the military life and moved back home to London to live on his wealthy estate.\n\nSo here's a collection of moments that made him the best character i've ever played.\n\nWe all receive mysterious letters asking us to attend the Tower of London. Old man Jenkins is convinced he's being hired for repair work because of the way the letters been phrased and he could use a job. He thanks the mysterious servant woman and picks up his tool bag (just a bag of biscuits a shotgun and his famous homebrew fortified wine) before heading out.\n\nThey get their brief, old man jenkins is pretty confused about what's going on but they decide to split up. 2 members go to the park to look for clues of the target (a frogman) while another goes to the natural history museum to learn about frog habits etc. Old man Jenkins just wants to see the dinosaurs and picks up a book about frogs on the way out of the museum.\n\nThey get to the pond after evacuating everyone out of the park. One character steps on a frog to try and get the frogman to come out. Old man jenkins takes a diplomatic approach and captures a frog in a jar to interrogate. But decides he likes the lil guy and keeps it as a pet.\n\nThe other character steps into the water to find the giant frog. Old man jenkins starts throwing biscuits into the water to try and get the frog to come out. All of a sudden Old Man Jenkins sees something move under the water. He readies sheila (his ex wife who he stays together with for the kids, also known as a double barreled shotgun) and aims at the looming figure..... a giant lump of mud. *BAM* blows it apart and wounds his ally.\n\nNo frogman in the park so we go to ask around the palace building because they're the only ones who are prone to being attacked by the frogman.\n\nWe go in and talk to these workers, one is hesitant to answer till Old Man Jenkins offers him a biscuit. As soon as he eases up Old Man Jenkins loses it and leaps to his feet. Pointing sheila at his head he asks for all the information which the guy spills his guts on.\n\nMy partner begins talking to the palace guy and convinces him to remove his robes so we can use them as bait. Old man jenkins doesn't like the fact a guys getting naked and intimidates him into putting them back on. Old man jenkins gets a bit confused though, and decides to get naked.\n\nCue madness, everyone at the table begins yelling at old man jenkins to put his clothes on and roll to intimidate. Old man jenkins isn't scared of them and walks around naked and free. Causing the palace guards to leave the room in a rush.\n\nThey manage to talk Old Man Jenkins into getting into the robes and walking to the pub through the park..... Old man jenkins puts his new friend \"Not a biscuit\" into his pocket in his jar and begins walking.\n\nBoss jumps out (Causing old man jenkins to shit his new pyjama robes) and one party member hits the gas valve on the frogmans suit. Causing him to explode inside his helmet..... Old man jenkins scoops some of the frog juice into a jar as \"evidence\" and then puts a dollop into his pipe for smoking purposes. Which makes him trip balls....\n\nNever played a jokey character like this before. But god dam i wanna do more.",

        "text": "This is going to take some setup, so just roll with it. Unknown Armies is a modern horror game.\n\nThe PCs are looking for one PC's sister, who is missing. They have found a supernatural being called the Face Merchant who has a doll shop in an otherspace (pocket dimension). The Face Merchant admits she swapped the sister's identity with a doll's identity, as the Face Merchant doesn't see a difference between people and dolls. The PC's needed info to find the sister, and the Face Merchant agreed to provide that info if they retrieved some dolls from a client.\n\n The client was an old daft woman named Judith who lived in a retirement home. She had dolls of her daughter Karen and her son-in-law David. She would talk to the dolls instead of her real children. She hated that Karen had married David because she is a miserable racist. She kept calling David a Mexican landscaper, when he is actually a Native-American dentist. She also routinely threw the David doll in the garbage and generally abused it.\n\n The PC's went to meet the actual David and Karen, and found they were lethargic and that David often fell and hurt himself. They figured out there was indeed some sort of voodoo doll stuff going on here and that the lethargy was from the fact that the dolls at the old folks home were somehow stealing the vigor from the actual people, and that the abuse of the David doll was harming the real David.\n\n The PC's decided to steal the dolls and, in order to protect the real world people from the effects, one cast a ritual to protect the real Karen and David in the meantime.\n\n &lt; That PC doesn't actually know how to do rituals. He, Davey, has a German shepherd named Goliath who talks to him in a clipped German accent and tells him how to do things.&gt;\n\n The next day when they went to get the dolls, a PC found Judith dead. She had been strangled and someone had dragged her corpse under the bed. She has tiny hand prints on her neck. That PC heard something small moving through the air vents and, with a mirror, was able to see the dolls escaping.\n\n &lt;Davey asked Goliath if his ritual was responsible for Judith's death, and Goliath responded, \"I vass chuss followink orders.\"&gt;\n\n He tried to stop them, but they escaped. Davey, the sheriff of the town, visited real David and Karen, and found they were now chipper and healthy. He sent them to the hospital to claim the mother's body, and got permission to search their house for clues.\n\n While in their house, he heard something moving in the kitchen. He saw the cabinet door under the sink close, and heard something moving around. He duct-taped the doors closed to prevent escape and called the rest of the PCs.\n\n When the rest of the PCs arrived, the sheriff tried to talk the dolls into surrendering(?!) through the door. He heard movement that finally stopped with the sound of something small falling against the door. When they opened the door, the Karen doll fell out, motionless, holding the cap to a bleach bottle like a cup.\n\n &lt;Player interjection, \"Oh, right, this is a *horror* game.\"&gt;\n\n When the sheriff looked further under the sink, he found that the David doll had hung himself.\n\n They collected the dolls and returned them to the Face Merchant, who wept like her own children had died.\n\n Unknown Armies is weird, yo.",

        "text": "Alternatively, \"Chasing shaggy dogs and winding up with plague fleas.\"\n\nIt's been a while since I've written up some of the misadventures of the BEST HEROES! Partly because our gaming group hasn't been able to get together too frequently, and I missed the last two sessions due to my schedule matching up even more poorly with theirs.\n\nThe previous write-ups are here:\n\n1. [Best Heroes Prove They are Great Detectives](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/489ala/5e_truly_the_best_most_skilled_and_most_noble/)\n\n2. [Best Heroes Prove They are Great Warriors](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/48f0lv/5e_best_heroes_battling_the_cultists/)\n\n3.

[Best Heroes Prove They are Great Scholars, Gentlemen, and Dragon-Slayers](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4e9md8/5e_best_heroes_three_tales_of_love_and_revenge/)\n\nI realize now that I hadn't written up the previous short session that I was there for, the quick summary of that was we eventually made it to the village of Uther, and who should we find there? None other than our paladin, Forsetti, serving his sentence in a labour camp. We exchanged our goblin prisoner for him, and also promised the warden of the camp that we would deliver to him three more corpses (of any sort) that could be used to create skeleton/zombie labourers on our return trip.\n\nWe got some supplies for our coming quest to slay the dragon, and while in the inn, we encountered the first group that the wizard Farnsworth had commissioned to slay the dragon. They had apparently been lingering here since they were sent out. They seemed quite unsavoury. Forsetti tries to ingratiate himself with this party, including flirting with their gnomish rogue. He fails miserably on all counts after misreading the situation and dancing on the table, he ends up sulking and slinking away. Meanwhile, our new friend Frylock gathered information related to our quest, mainly that the dragon actually hasn't been seen for some time, and that nobody's returned that set out to find it. Dirk meanwhile successfully flirted with a buff female guard, and the two enjoyed the night together while the rest of us slept.\n\nIn the morning we headed north, through the desert known as the Shifting Sands. We were stealthily robbed by some bandits one night, and lost some of our scrolls, gold, and potions, but found ourselves unable to really pursue them through the desert at night. The next morning, a tornado started to whip up as we travelled through the desert. We managed to find shelter underneath a dune, despite being blinded by the whipped up sand. The torches that serve as guide posts through the Shifting Sands are being ripped up as the storm moves through the desert. We notice a familiar floating eyeball thing **[It was essentially controlled by the powers of the city, to spy on us during our journey]** hovering over the centre of the storm, but aren't sure if that means it's responsible for the storm or not.\n\nWe managed to dig ourselves out of the dune, without any major damage to the carriage. To our surprise, the torches were seemingly replaced in the path ahead of us. They led us to the village of Feer, without any further incident.\n\nThe summary of the sessions I missed were essentially:\n\n- Group gets a wagon and a few mules. Continues heading north through the Dagger Sands. A Desert lined with numerous sharp spikes of hardened dirt. Where the Shifting Sands was more like the sandy Sahara, the Dagger Sands is more like the rough Mojave, but with some event in the past that caused the hard aridisols to form these spines, rather than a flat desert pavement. Travel speed is 1/4 movement here, as movement must be slow and deliberate to avoid injury.\n\n- More and more information makes it sound like we weren't told everything about this dragon. Most of the attacks on people were by bandits and raiders. Not much has actually been seen of a dragon lately.\n\n- They came across another one of the commissioned dragon-slaying groups as they headed to Outpost Dorr. It was all-but wiped out, except for a wizard, who joined up with us. **[Trevor's player's wife's PC. Neither of them were able to make it to yesterday's session, however]**\n\n- Pass through Outpost Dorr, get into a minor misunderstanding about water access and have to barter their way around that \n\n- Onto the dragon's lair. It's an old ruined city, near a volcano. In order to cross a bridge across a ravine surrounding the city, the party makes a deal with some golems guarding the bridge that they would find double the worth of the ancient city's currency and pay them upon our return trip out of the city.\n\n- Narrowly avoid being eaten by the dragon by using one of the three mules we recently acquired as a decoy.\n\n- Had seen some humanoids off in the distance of the smog. Goblinoids, perhaps? Some appear to have a more serpentine form.\n\n*****\n\nSo, that brings us to this session. Hoo boy, this session. Now, the Best Heroes(TM) have screwed up before, but, man, oh man, I don't think I've been a party to something this bad since our one group of characters accidentally caused an actual global cataclysm, but that's a story for another time (same core gaming group, essentially, though... Geez, that campaign was like, 7 or 8 years ago IRL, now).\n\nThe Best Heroes are:\n\n(Active PCs this session)\n\n**Ulaan** - TN Half-Elf Ranger - Stoic former military scout from a faraway land.\n\n**Dirk** - CN Half-Orc Barbarian - A big bruiser with a heart of MUSCLES and MANLINESS!\n\n**Forsetti** - LG **[I have previously erroneous listen him as LN, but I think we established that he's actually supposed to be LG in the meantime]** Human Paladin - Grandian native. Noble-born, compulsive social climber and incorrigible flirt.\n\n**Frylock** of the Fourth House - LN Human Fighter (Eldritch Knight) - Grandian native. Military reject, working in the service of his nearest relative, the wizard Farnsworth. A bit dimwitted, but steadfastly unable to concede the idea that he might not know everything. Thoroughly devoted to God-King Gabriel.\n\n(Inactive PCs this session)\n\n**Deceipt** - TN? Tiefling Warlock - Acerbic, misanthropic, (pyro-maniacal?), and entirely unapologetic. Remained in Grandia City to do research. **[Deceipt's player is the DM for this entire dragon-slaying sidequest. Frylock's player is our usual DM]**\n\n**Trevor** - CG Half-Elf Cleric - Grandian native. Rabble-rousing, ~~sewer~~Storm Drain-dwelling, emotional, teenaged trickster-cleric. Remained with the carriage and wagon **[Or, y'know, whatever hand-wavey explanation you prefer]**. **[His player had to work this weekend, unfortunately]**\n\n**??** - ?? Human? Wizard - Commissioned to go slay a dragon. Only survivor of her party, recently joined up with the Best Heroes. Likewise remained with the carriage and wagon. **[I'd provide more details on her, but nobody's around online that actually knows things like her name and background. If I find out these details, I'll edit them in. Her player also had to work this weekend, unfortunately]**\n\n*****\n\nThe outskirts of the ruined city were caked in thick black ash. It hung heavy in the air. The air was also heavy with something else. Ulaan was not entirely familiar with this sensation, but it weighed down on him, perhaps even more oppressively than the smog. It almost felt like it was stinging his skin beneath his armour. There was a faint, almost metallic taste in his mouth. He had seen many sights scouting for his grandfather's army, but this was something entirely new to him. \n\n\"You guys can all feel this too, right?\" Frylock asked the group, \"The aether here feels really charged up for some reason.\"\n\n\"I don't think we should stay here any longer than we have to. Look, these footprints lead towards the middle.\" Dirk guided their eyes from the ground in front of them to what appeared to be a central plaza. The trail of footprints contained a mixture of medium and large-sized creatures', none of which were necessarily distinctive.\n\nThe group found a mostly serviceable stable building to leave the carriage and wagons, as well as the remaining mules, in. They would be safe here, hidden from prying eyes, including a dragon flying overhead. Hopefully. Pressing further into the city, the air quality continued to drop. Ulaan covered his face with his cloak, but it really didn't do much to help. Ominously, as they approached the central plaza, it was increasingly obvious that despite the worsening air, the ground and the walls of the surrounding buildings were nearly pristine. Ash wouldn't seemingly get anywhere near them.\n\nBefore the group could cross into the plaza, some figures began to emerge from the alleys and side streets, to block the way forward. Their approach had been obscured by the smog and harsh winds. Not wanting to be trapped out in the open on this main street, the group prepared to turn around, only to hear very heavy footsteps behind them. Four large creatures blocked their way backward. Nine medium-sized creatures blocked the way forward. The tall, cloaked creature in the centre of the nine, lowered its hood, revealing the wild fur of a bugbear. The group places their hands on their weapons. The bugbear growls some commands in Goblin. Dirk and Ulaan, who speak Orcish, manage to understand a few words, mainly \"archers\" and \"roof\".\n\nDirk asks, in Orcish, why they obstruct our path. The bugbear holds up his hand, signalling his soldiers to wait. He beckons an Orc warrior from the edge of the group to join him. He introduces himself as Hoarse, and his Orcish companion as Kell. They demand to know why were have come to this city. Ulaan answers that \"&lt;We have no quarrel with you. We have been sent here to kill a dragon.&gt;\" \n\nHoarse and Kell, exchange a brief glance. \"&lt;Oh. Another one. There have been three groups of 'adventurers' to make that claim recently. Two managed to slip away from us. We haven't seen or heard them since they arrived. The others, well, let's just say we dined well that night.&gt;\" **[Being apparently the sixth group the wizard sent north to fight this dragon, there has been a running them of \"Another group of yahoos?\" whenever we introduce ourselves and state our purpose for travelling through the desert]**.\n\n\"&lt;These ones have the sense to not start slashing at us on sight. Maybe they'll be of some use, Hoarse.&gt;\"\n\n\"&lt;Hrmm... maybe. But we should not speak of these things here. Come.&gt;\" The bugbear splayed his fingers and a small glowing ball of light emerged from his fingertips. \"&lt;She has eyes and ears everywhere on the surface.&gt;\"\n\nThe hill giants behind the party step forward and marshal the party towards the alley that Hoarse starts down. \"&lt;Follow.&gt;\" Dirk, recognizing the Giant-speech immediately starts praising the size and might of the giants. The giants are caught off-guard that someone in the party speaks their language, and awkwardly accept the compliment.\n\nHoarse leads the party to well-hidden door in an alley. The immaculate stonework of the city is such that there wasn't even so much as an obvious seam around the edge of the door. Only those who know where to look would find it easily. A staircase leads the group down into the underbelly of the city. At least 5 or 6 stories deep. Forsetti tries speaking to the orcs and goblinoids in various languages along the way. His use of Dwarven causes all of the creatures to stop in their tracks and glare at him **[DM: Aaaanndd... you just got a penalty to any further social interactions with this group.]**\n\nThe undercity is actually a bustling, thriving community. It's well lit by torches and bioluminescence, including a large, spherical fungus of some sort hanging down from the centre of the grand chamber's ceiling. The air here tastes clear and fresh. Well, mostly. And the aether feels much less oppressive. There appears to be a community of various goblinoids, orcs, and serpentine people **[Yuan-ti, probably, but none of our characters are familiar with the race]**, numbering somewhere around 500. The hill giants take a branching path towards another side of the cavern, one with a much higher ceiling. Hoarse leads the party to a central building. Within is a large polished wooden round table with chairs. Hoarse addresses the group, in Common, now. \"If you're truly here to kill a dragon, then, let us talk.\"\n\nKell begins speaking, also in Common, \"The red dragon Hylianastros has been here for many, many years. Recently, there have been reports that she has been hosting a male visitor of her species. We fear that she may be spawning. Near as anyone has been able to guess, she is at least a century old. She makes her lair in the spire at the centre of the city. Now, tell us, what could you possibly offer that would turn the tide of any battle against her?\" **[Kell's not exactly wrong to ask here. As level 4 characters, the CR 17 elite Adult Red Dragon is well beyond our pay grade. There may be more forces throughout the city. With an army of Orcs and Hobgoblins, we might stand a chance, if we do some proper planning and find some useful artifacts within the ruins of the city.]**\n\nAfter some debate amongst the party in a private chamber to the side of this main one, it is decided that the party would absolutely be useful for recon/scouting to help put together a strategy to defeat her, and we'd be able to add our talents to the fight itself. Per our original agreement with Farnsworth, we need the body. Per our agreement with the bridge golems, we need 40 knuts each (the ancient currency of this city). The rest of our fee will be negotiable based on the contributions to the actual defeat of the dragon. The leaders of the settlement in turn go to the chamber and debate. The knuts are no problem. There's storerooms full of the old junk here. The body, is grudgingly acceptable. Negotiation on the rest is fair. They ask one more thing of us, our fealty should this group ever come into conflict with Grandian forces. This is acceptable to the party, as they're no fans of God-King Gabriel (except Frylock), and they've been quietly trying to figure out how to rebel and get home, while maybe also overthrowing the tyrant. The party's conditions for this is that they will only fight against legitimate military targets and not harm civilians and non-combatants, which is acceptable. With the successful conclusion of negotiations, Hoarse leads us to somewhere we can rest for the night.\n\nIn the morning, Hoarse asked us to fulfill two tasks that would potentially help fight the dragon. Firstly, the goblinoid group has access to the old library of this city. It's massive and sprawling. Hoarse is wise enough to know that the information within is valuable, but he is no scholar himself, and he's about as learned as they come here. If we could go the library and find some useful information, it would undoubtedly help. Secondly, there is a tunnel that leads to what should very obviously connect to some sort of chamber, but the goblinoids have been unable to find the door in the city's immaculate stonework. It might be something, it might be nothing. A spell of comprehend languages is cast upon the entire party, which splits into two groups. As our scholarly-types aren't here, Forsetti and Ulaan will put their searching skills to use in the library. Frylock and Dirk will use their muscles and (a portable battering ram) to go find the hidden door.\n\nFrylock and Dirk reach the cavern and set to work. The end wall is approximately 10 feet wide, they line up the battering ram and give a good heave-ho every two feet or so. No luck. Just some cracks and dents in the wall. The Orcish mining crew with them confirms that the sides of the chamber don't have any hidden doors in their stonework either. Frylock has an idea, with their hammers and pickaxes, they'll try to punch through the centre of the wall. The stonework doors have only been about 2 feet thick at most, they could probably punch through the door or wall with a little effort.\n\nAfter about 6 hours have passed overall, Frylock and Dirk are taking a breather. They've managed to punch through about 4 feet of wall due to their tenacity and competition with each other, with no results. Then, it hits Frylock \"Wait a minute... 'crack', 'crack', 'crack', 'dent', 'crack'. Stone probably should crack and not dent! Let's check there!\" He bluffs that it was because of some new insight that came from looking through all of the rubble they'd created. Everyone in the room with him sees through his bullshit. Still, his idea was right, and with a few sharp blows, the stonework door crumbles, revealing a crypt of some sort. **[DM: \"This was a skill challenge that you just had to get two successes on, and couldn't auto-fail. It took you 12 rolls. I kept count.\"]** **(BEST HEROES!)** The air inside the room is positively frigid and feels heavy with magic. Skeletons are interred along the wall. **[Like the draugr in skyrim, basically]**. In the centre of the room, there is a sarcophagus that appears to be made of pure ice. Inside, a skeleton adorned in obviously expensive robes. Inscribed on the stone slab beneath the sarcophagus is \"Last of the High Mages\". Frylock bluffs that he knows what he's seeing, a little more successfully this time. Dirk and Frylock send some of the mining crew to go get Hoarse and the best warriors he can bring.\n\n*****\n\nMeanwhile, in the library, Ulaan and Forsetti are awestruck at the massive size of the structure, and as they descend into the main chamber, the stairs beneath them light up and glow, fading as they proceed onward. The stairs lead them to a central area. A set of 9 prominent tiles, each inscribed with a different symbol, sit next to a large desk. Upon that desk rest several large volumes. A quick perusal of those books reveals them to be some kind of index, organized by topics. Each individual entry contains 6 symbols in a unique order. Simple deductive logic leads to the realization that stepping on the tiles in the correct order causes a path to light up in the floor, leading directly to the selected item. \n\nThe first topic researched is history of this city. From this book, they learn that the city was known simply as \"The Conclave\", many, many years ago. It was essentially a city-sized university/academy. It was a great centre of knowledge and learning, built within a lush, fertile, green paradise. The Conclave was ruled by the High Mage, an elected ruler, to whom nobility and other powerful people within the city transferred large amounts of their magical power, in addition to other resources. High Mages were basically worshiped as both guardians and guiding lights for the citizens. Nearly absolute trust was vested in these rulers, and they were rarely replaced before their magically-extended lifespans ended naturally. The Conclave was well-respected, but they had jealous enemies too. Many references to a group know as \"the Domans\" as raiders and barbarians are found. These raids eventually led to full-on wars. Ominously, the final entry in the heavy tome is a single line. \"We have started to experiment.\"\n\nNext, Ulaan recovers some maps of the city, as these are lighter, they opt to take these back to the party and goblinoids' leadership. The maps are all obviously pre-ruination of the city, but may provide some insight into places of interest. Most armories were in heavily destroyed parts of the city, unfortunately **[Reliquaries and other such things would be good things to look up, but neither Forsetti or Ulaan would probably be familiar with that terminology]**.\n\nThey decide to look further into these \"experiments\". This entry is listed in red ink in the index tome. It has a 9-digit code, but three of the digits have been intentionally left blank. This is a puzzle that is probably beyond the pair of soldiers. Before they can really attempt to solve it though, they're interrupted by Hoarse, who is calling them to come join their compatriots at the newly unearthed crypt.\n\n*****\n\nWhile waiting for the others to return, Frylock inspects the sarcophagus a little closer. He notices a dagger clutched in the fingers of the robed skeleton. Dirk tells Frylock that he won't stop him from trying to pick it up, but he's staying outside the crypt, and barricading Frylock in there at the first sign of trouble. Dirk has been quietly moving the pile of rubble from the collapsed door and mining attempts near the open doorway, to provide materials for such a barricade. Frylock decides against taking the dagger right now, after a long internal struggle **[Picture shoulder angel and devil, pretty much. Alternatively, the DM repeatedly asking \"Are you sure?\"]**\n\nWhen Hoarse, Kell, Forsetti, and Ulaan arrive with the mining crew and the 30 best warriors that were on-hand, Hoarse is immediately overwhelmed by the magic emanating from the crypt, causing him to briefly collapse. Still, the group sets into motion. First, the 19 skeletons in the crypt are all wedge into their tombs with large rocks. Then, Frylock attempts to use Mage Hand to push open the sarcophagus. His mage hand dissipates as soon as it gets too close to it, though. A few further tests confirm that only magic is blocked by the sarcophagus. Hoarse lobs a fireball at it, but the fire fizzles out at about the same distance as the mage hand. Torches and rocks thrown at the sarcophagus bounce off just as you'd expect, however. Frylock activates his Absorb Elements ability to protect him from the cold of touching the sarcophagus directly, well, through a javelin, anyway. He borrows one of Forsetti's javelins and tries to use it to pry open the sarcophagus **[DM: \"Are you sure?\"]**. Leverage is not on his side, unfortunately. The javelin is just not designed to pry something that heavy like this. Though it requires much closer contact, he decides to use the prybar we've brought along. **[DM: \"Are you *sure*?\"]**\n\nThis works, and the seal holding the lid shut is broken. All of the magic in the room feels like it's being drawn into the now glowing dagger. The skeleton's toe bones begin to twitch and wiggle. The sounds of rattling bones are heard throughout the room. **[Ha! Knew it! Totally worth blocking them in!]** Frylock grabs the hilt of the dagger. Instantly, pain shoots through his entire body. He loses access to all of his magical abilities. His mind feels like it's being split in two. Each second his hand remains on the dagger feels like several years in terms of the toil it's putting on his physiology. Hoarse collapses from the feeling that his magic is being ripped from his body, and his own life force starts to drain away. Ulaan and a few of the warriors pull him away from the chamber. Frylock has one idea on how to stop all of this:\n\n**Frylock's Player: \"I lift the dagger and plunge it deep into the skull of the skeleton.\"**\n\n**DM: \"I... uh... are you sure? Like, *absolutely* sure?\"**\n\n**Frylock's Player: \"Yes, damn it! Screw this asshole skeley-man!\"** \n\nThe skull crumples as the dagger is brought down on it. Instantaneously, Frylock's flesh begins to wither away. He shrivels to a dried husk of skin around his bones. A deep, gravelly voice sounds out from his throat. \"&lt;Ah... Thank you for&gt;... awakening me.\" The group understood the first few words due to their comprehend languages enchantment, but towards the end, the words clearly shifted to the Common tongue. Forsetti dashes back outside of the crypt as Dirk lobs a flask of alchemist's fire at the creature now wearing their dead friend's skin.  It rises, and turns towards the doorway, bright blue flames light each of his eye sockets. The fire doesn't seem to bother it in the slightest. Dirk and the others quickly piles some stones up as a makeshift barricade as the skeleton begins to hover in the air, and the skeletons from the crypts begin to free themselves from their improvised prisons. They appear to be rather indignant about it, too. Everyone begins to run as fast as they can towards the tunnel entrance.\n\n**[Our gaming group's not big on killing PCs. We usually leave opportunities for last second avoidance of death, or ways to resurrect. But, in this case, Frylock took a series of actions that pretty much resulted not only in instantaneous death with no chance to save, but also the complete annihilation of his very soul. He's beyond perma-dead at this point. The irony that our non-killer regular DM is the first person to really lose a PC is not lost on us. He's told to just start rolling up a new character.]**\n\n**Continued in comments. TL;DR at the very bottom**",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4pul2i/anima_beyond_fantasy_the_legend_of_the_demon_king/",
        "text": "Well, since there was some popular response to my last tale, I figured I'd continue with another one.  This one takes place a few months of game time after our last story.  But first... the cast!\n\n**Characters**\n\n**Albert Rickard** - You know him from last time, the man who would eventually become the so-called Demon King.  A warlock (fighter/wizard hybrid) of great power.  By this point, Al had managed to avenge his family all over the mercenary band that had massacred them, but the whole ordeal had left him a little... off.  His aspirations had shifted, and while he still desired to become a God, he'd now set his sights on a more realistic temporary goal.  He wanted his own kingdom... and this is the story of how he got it.\n\n**Matthew Revale** - Albert's best friend, and closest thing he had to a confidant, who had also become more powerful by this point.  He had begun studying martial arts at this point, and had essentially abandoned using his sword.  He'd also acquired a pair of familiars - a light elemental named Anna that mirrored his martial arts ability, and a small psychic fairy named Zoe.\n\n**Selene (NEW!)**  - Selene was a redheaded daimah nephilim that had joined the two after a battle that resulted in a destroyed bar.  For context, pureblood Daimah are basically a race of half-cats, they have the ears and tail, and affinity to nature; they're shorter and lighter than humans, and physically weaker.  A nephilim is just a human who has the soul of a different race instead of their own, meaning that she had a portion of the abilities, and the only real physical sign was her ears being SLIGHTLY elevated.  Selene was an illusionist/shadow, meaning she started as a thief/wizard hybrid, and class changed into a thief/fighter hybrid early on.  She was talented with a sword, with aikido, and the book of illusion magic, which works exactly like you probably think it does.  Selene was another PC.\n\nJust to really put things in perspective here, at the time of this story, the party was about level 3 in Anima (which, by Anima's own charts, is about 9 in D&amp;D.)\n\n**The Story**\n\nNow, in the base world of Anima, the major plothook that many GMs can use is the fact that the Sacred Holy Empire of Abel (say that five times fast) which is basically the dead center of the world, is currently in a tense standoff with the Azur Alliance, their southern neighbors.  If they actually went to war, the loss of life would be severe.\n\nAl, Matt, and Selene, having finished up with Al's family vengeance line, had been attempting to figure out what to do with a chunk of Starmetal (basically meteoric steel, the stuff the Sword of Martin is forged with in Redwall #References) that they had found, and somehow or another wound up attempting to kidnap the child empress Elisabetta of the Abel Empire.  Honestly, I do not remember how we wound up at this decision, I feel like drinking was involved.\n\nWell, the kidnapping went about half-as-well as planned.  They got her out, and it turned out she'd gone along with it out of boredom.  Her main bodyguard, a scary mofo by the name of Kisidan, a.k.a. \"The Godslayer\" had been hot on their heels the entire time, just watching for one of them to do something stupid.  WHOOPS.\n\nSo, diplomacy happened, and Al struck a deal with her - in exchange for a vow from her of infinite friendship for him and his own, he would deliver to her the lands of the Azur Alliance and end the war.  The tense exchange ended, they walked out, Matt asked Al about the arrangement, and Al's reply was basically \"Not a chance, but this way she won't get suspicious when we start taking everything.\"\n\nSo, the question is, how do three people (well, 5 if you include familiars,) seize an empire?  The answer, my friends, is raw power.  And numbers.\n\nFirst, the power.  In Anima, wizards use Zeon to cast magic.  Now, the thing about Zeon is that it regenerates VERY SLOWLY, which is how wizards are gated.  They can do insane things, as long as they have zeon.  But without it, they are very weak.  And it was time for Albert to show exactly how far he was willing to go for infinite power.  The answer was ALL THE WAY.\n\nAlbert, at this point, had an understanding of all 100 levels of both Creation and Destruction magic, but he lacked something required to cast all 100.  In Anima, it's referred as gnosis.  Gnosis is basically a measure of humanity/godhood, and your impact on the world; a person with a gnosis of zero will live his entire life doing nothing special, and probably dying in the first real battle he sees.  A Gnosis of 5 is the man who will train a real hero, and he is worthy of being the death that motivates a hero.  Gnosis 10 IS that hero, someone who is going to go out and do things, shake the status quo, and make everyone go \"whoa.\"  This goes up to Gnosis of 20, at which point even the Gods themselves are staring down at you and watching every move eagerly.  If you pass Gnosis 20, you are officially no longer human.  You can't reproduce, and you can now spend your development points (level-ups) on creature powers.  Most player characters, our party included, have a gnosis of 10.  This number is supposed to be fixed, few things can change it.\n\nAnyone can cast magic up to level 80, but to cast 81-90, referred to as \"High Magic,\" you need a Gnosis of at least 25.  91-100, referred to as \"Divine Magic\" you need a Gnosis of at least 45.\n\nWell, Albert wanted access to his High Magic.  The level 80 spell of Creation, the highest he can reach, is a spell known as Chimaera.  The target of Chimaera, cast at the level Al could manage at that point, became a Gnosis 25 being PERMANENTLY.  There is almost no way to undo that spell, but it came with huge strengths.  For one, Gnosis 25, meaning High Magic.  For another, it gave Al enough Development Points that, in game terms, he would automatically gain two levels, but the condition was that those points could ONLY be spent on creature powers.  No big deal, as every couple of levels you also gain an attribute point for free, which Al used to increase his magic-casting ability.\n\nThe spell was cast, and Al became more than a man.  Whereas before he was a young boy with black hair and bright eyes, the transformation basically made him look like Laharl from Disgaea.  Blue hair, red eyes, enough proof to know he wasn't human anymore.\n\nNext, Al used basically what was left of his Zeon to invoke \"Create Being,\" a spell that just let him generate a soul-less lifeform whose attributes were up to him, capped by only the spell's strength, and were considered to have a gnosis of 25 for creature power selection.  He had to pay a maintenance on the spell, but the being would be 100% loyal.  As well, he could create beings that were at max one level below him.  (Yes, if you're wondering, this DOES mean you could make an endless army of NPCs to fight for you.  HOW DOES THIS BOOK OF MAGIC EXIST?!?)\n\nHe created a perfect copy of himself, but when I say perfect, I mean physically.  Where Al was frail, the copy was not.  (the highest physical attributes he could select.)  It opened its eyes, stood up, and Al set the next step into motion.  Matthew gathered his own zeon, and invoked one of the most powerful spells in the Essence book, \"Transmigrate Soul.\"  This spell allowed him to move a soul from one body into another; it is essentially a way to save someone from death, because you can grab their departing soul, heal the body, and stuff them back into it.  In this case, he took Al's soul out of his original body, and stuffed him into the newly made body.\n\nThis meant Al went from level 5 to 4, but because the level 4 body had been crafted by magic and NOT creature power requirements, I was able to use actual DP for that 4th level, so Al basically gained a level for free in this exchange.  \n\nAnother couple of adventures happened in which Al tested how powerful his new body was, and lots of people called BS, and Matthew began looking for a way to equal Al once again (But he REFUSED STEADFASTLY to forego his humanity, he had principles.)  One of those adventures involved the destruction of a kraken and the rifling of a treasure cave, and it was from this that the prinny brigade was born.  Creation had a spell that allowed a wizard to make homunculi; level zero creatures that had no souls, but could be birthed in LARGE numbers and maintained cheaply.  In this case, going off the Disgaea joke, Al's homunculi all appeared as prinnies.  (Just look them up.)\n\nOut of the many he made, four of them stood out, almost as jokes.  A bright blue one, a red one, a pink one, and a black one (which had an afro and spoke in a super deep voice, substituting the prinny's 'd00d' tic for a tic of 'man,' I swear to God we aren't racist but the jokes really just get away from us sometimes,) that Al jokingly called Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde.  The names stuck, so we now had 96 nameless prinnies, and these four jokers.  Much loot was had in that cave, the 100 prinnies made carrying everything easy, and now that we had resources, it was time to become even stronger.\n\nAl needed to overcome his only restriction; Zeon maximums.  He had, for awhile, managed to expand it dramatically through the use of the Homunculi. See, any living creature in Anima can hold Zeon in its body, but only beings with souls naturally generate it.  And Wizards/warlocks can draw zeon out of other living beings to restore themselves, as long as they have permission.  So for the longest time, Al traveled with a cadre of living batteries that he had to charge himself.  Worth it when he had to vent all of it in one grand battle, but it took literally weeks to recharge all of them.  This just would not do.\n\nRemember how I mentioned that only living beings with souls could generate Zeon?  And that Al happened to be willing to do literally ANYTHING for the power he wanted?  These are related.  \n\nSo Al used Create Being to make a creature that had high enough magical stats that IF it could create zeon, it would make an obscene amount of it.  He also gave it an intelligence so low that it basically lacked sentience, but what memories it did have (created by the spell \"Create Memories,\") were of him, of loving him, and wanting to do anything to help him.  He ALSO gave the creature Physical Exemption, meaning it did not require sleep, or food, or air.  Next, he used the spell \"Metamorphosis\" to transform it into a band of metal that would fit around his finger, meaning it was always in contact with his body, so he'd always have access to it.  \n\nFinally, he called on his High Magic for the first time, and invoked \"Create Soul.\"  It works exactly as it sounds, he could create a brand new soul that had no body, but if used on a Created Being, it would break the need for him to maintain them, because they would become their own living organism.  He infused the soul into the band, and thus created a living zeon battery that needed no food, no air, that no one could even recognize as a living magical item, and that was wholly loyal and would allow him to draw on its zeon whenever he needed it.\n\nHe did this again, and again, and again, and again, until he had cast the spells and repeated the process so many times that the \"ring of infinite zeon,\" as he had named it, that it went from his finger, all the way up his arm to the shoulder.  At this point, Albert had access to tens of thousands of zeon PER DAY.  All he had to sacrifice was his morals... who needs those?\n\nNext, he knew that Matthew wasn't going to be enough to keep him safe in the upcoming war, so he created another being that he named Cecilia.  She was a pure fighter, EXTREMELY beautiful, and an amazon of a woman.  By that I mean she could easily dual-wield two-handed swords, and she once improvised a weapon by using a marble pillar.  \n\nNext, Al created a soul for her, but then immediately used both \"Create Memories\" from Creation and \"Destroy Memories\" from Destruction to weave a false life for her; she forgot that she was not a real living being, and became convinced she was a human, her and Albert had known each other for years, and that the beautiful ring he had created (nothing special, just jewelry) on her finger was their wedding ring.  Thus in one fell swoop was born Cecilia Rickard, the wife and lifeguard of Albert.  \n\nSo the 'party' had now gone from Al, Matt, and Selene to Al, Matt, Selene, Cecilia, Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, Anna, and Zoe.  But, that was all we would need to seize a principality for ourselves.\n\nThe party struck out to the south, eventually arriving in the principality of Remo, the southern reach of the Azur Alliance.  The plan to take the principality was quite simple.\n\nStep one: The party began to spread the myth of a Lord Blackthorne.  Some great player in the shadows who supposedly had a military of nearly limitless strength, boundless wealth, and who backed those he found deserving.  Pretty soon, whispers took over, and THEY were hearing stories of Blackthorne from other people.\n\nStep two: Albert and Selene went out into the southern hills, and via a combination of Destruction and Illusion magics, make it appear that a dragon had awoken and was RAVAGING the land.  Wholesale death and destruction ensued, for quite awhile.\n\nStep three: When the people were getting a little rebellious, the party made their next move.  Albert created armor and sigils, and fine steeds, and the not-prinny-or-elemental-or-fairy members of the party rode into town the next day as knights wearing the Black Rose sigil of Lord Blackthorne.  They came to the regional lord and explained that the benevolent Lord Blackthorne had heard of his plight, and was willing to lend his aid for a price to be paid at a later date.  The lord, scared of rebellion, agreed.\n\nStep four: The party vanished into the hills and relaxed for about three days.  During that period of time, they scarred up an area to make it look like a great battle had taken place there, Albert created a dragon head for proof, and they got ready.\n\nStep five: The party returned, dragon head in tow, and presented it to the lord, along with a great tale of success and valor in combat.  He was beyond grateful.  They told him that in three days, Lord Blackthorne would arrive to claim his payment.\n\nStep six: Albert metamorphosis-ed himself into Lord Blackthorne; a good mental image is Lucius Malfoy but with Mr. Gold's (from Once Upon a Time) personality.  He came to the lord and told him that in no uncertain terms, he desired his daughter's hand in marriage.  The lord backed down, saying that he would never give Blackthorne that.  Blackthorne was not pleased, and he informed the lord that he was coming in three days to claim his payment.  A deal was a deal.\n\nThe party went undercover as themselves (so... not really undercover) and just existed for about three days while the town went NUTS.  Soldiers were searching high and low for Blackthorne, and just nothing was working out for them.\n\nOn the third day, at sunset, Blackthorne and his 'knights' appeared in the throne room, seemingly out of nowhere.  (A psychic illusion provided by Zoe got them there.)  He asked the lord if he was ready to pay, and the lord again refused, but said that he had realized Blackthorne must have been given dark powers by Hell, and that he had taken proper steps.  \n\nTwo soldiers stepped out from the shadows, an older man and a younger woman.  Looking at the armor that they wore, the party instantly recognized the insignia of the Inquisition; the knights Templar of the Holy Church of Gaia.  Empowered by magic weapons and armor, given strengths of the divine, the inquisition were sworn to eliminate ALL supernatural threats from the surface of Gaia... and right here in front of them were some of the biggest ones in existence.  The inquisitors advanced on the party, drawing their holy weapons - magical armaments called \"Lawbringers.\"  As well, a group of Remo knights charged into the room.\n\n\"Powers from Hell, huh?  Well then, I suppose that makes me some sort of a demon then... if that's what you want, then that's what you'll receive!  Bow before me, mongrels!  FACE THE DEMON KING OF GAIA!\"  Albert's voice roared in challenge as the two sides charged into conflict...\n\nAnd I do believe that's quite enough for now.  If you enjoyed, I'll pick up the next part immediately after this. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4puknu/dd_5e_rescue_turned_genocide/",
        "text": "Just DMed my first 5e game and had a great time! It was a homebrew adventure. Characters are:\n\nKallista Carrion - Female Tiefling Sorceress. 6 and a half feet tall. Very charming but not at all trustworthy.\n\nEldeth Holdernek - Female Dwarf Monk. Tormented by dreams of the downfall of her race.\n\n\"Stubby\" - Half-Orc Bard. Desperately fame-hungry. Looks a bit like an Orc-version of Mr. T.\n\nAt the beginning of the adventure, Eldeth was travelling alone through a deep, dark forest in the middle of nowhere when she heard someone call for help. She ran to find an old man being surrounded by a pack of wolves. As she helped him fight them off, Kallista and Stubby arrived and lent a hand. They were almost all killed but luckily some guards from the nearby town of Stillwater showed up to save them.\n\nThe old man let the party rest in his house and told them the mayor was looking for adventurers to rescue her son, Duncan, who had been kidnapped by the local wood elves. Stillwater had only been founded a few months previous, and ever since the settlers arrived the elves had been giving them trouble. The party met with Mayor Shelda who promised them 100 gold each if they could rescue Duncan and an extra 50 each if they could kill the elf prince and bring his golden swords as proof.\n\nAfter failing their survival roll to track the elves, the party immediately set off in the wrong direction. They stumbled across a clearing where a Satyr was playing pan pipes. They tried to ask it for directions, but as a prank it tried to send them all to sleep. Stubby responded by casting sleep on it instead. They tied it to a tree and promised to let it go in exchange for directions to the elf camp, which it grudgingly gave. They then threw its pipes into the bushes, before untying it and letting it go on its way.\n\nNext they encountered two kobolds, carrying a bulging sack of loot, fleeing from a bear. They fought and killed the bear, but decided to take a rest after rather than chase down the kobolds.\n\nAfter their rest they stumbled into the path of two elves on a patrol. Eldeth immediately slinged a stone at them, so they ignored Kallista's attempt to negotiate. There was a quick battle. The party killed both elves, but Stubby took several arrows to the chest and was knocked out. Eldeth managed to stabilise him, but without any potions they needed to rest to get him back to full health. The trouble was that somebody would probably come looking for those elves soon enough. They quickly hid the elf bodies and carried Stubby as far off as they could to set up camp. Fortunately they weren't interrupted during the night, but when they returned to the site of the battle in the morning they found that the elf bodies were gone.\n\nAt last they made it to the elf camp, but the Elf Prince and his guards were ready for them. Stubby was once again peppered with arrows and knocked out. Kallista got lucky with a thunder-wave though and killed the prince and all but one of the guards. At that point, an old elf wizard came running out of one of the tents, pleading for peace. The party agreed and put down their weapons. While Eldeth tended to Stubby's wounds, Kallista negotiated with the wizard.\n\nThe elf wizard explained that this forest had been sacred to their tribe for generations, and that the humans had arrived recently and started chopping it down and generally fouling the area. The elves had tried to negotiate at first but were not listened to, so they had turned to violence. He offered to free Duncan and allow the villagers to leave the forest unharmed, but Mayor Shelda must face justice for desecrating the forest. Kallista got a bit cocky and pretended to negotiate but then at the last minute threw out a thunder-wave. Unfortunately the wizard passed his save and when the dust cleared he was still standing exactly as he was before, except a little more singed and a lot more angry. Unsurprisingly, this ended their negotiations and the battle resumed.\n\nStubby was already knocked out, and Eldeth managed to take down the wizard, but then took an arrow and was knocked out herself. It turned into a one-on-one duel between Kallista and the one surviving elf guard. Kallista was out of spells and kept missing with acid splash, while the guard really flukishly kept rolling 4s and 5s to try and hit her with her shortsword. Eventually one of Kallista's acid splashes landed and finished the guard off.\n\nKallista stabilised Eldeth, then searched the elf tents. She found Duncan and a small bag of gems, which she decided not to pocket and not tell anybody else about. Duncan told her that while a prisoner he had overheard that these were the last surviving elves of an ancient and reclusive tribe that once ruled these woods. Now that they were all dead, the tribe was lost forever.\n\nThe wind taken out of their sails a bit, the party spent one night camping in the remains of the elf camp before bringing Duncan home to his mother. She was delighted to see them and gave them the gold she had promised as well as offering them permanent jobs protecting the town. The party agreed and were granted a small house to live in. I guess that sets me up for my next game :)",

        "text": "So for those of you who don't know, XCOM 2 has an Alien Hunter expansion that adds some powerful weapons and three deadly alien rulers.\n\nFortunately I didn't encounter the rulers until my equipment was at the second tier. The aliens are working on something called the Avatar project throughout the game, if they fill the progress bar you have one month to sabotage it before you lose. I encountered the first ruler for the second time on the sabotage mission.\n\nRulers are unique in that they go after every one of your soldiers, not during the Aliens turn. They also have insane health and armor and will flee the mission if things go poorly, but they don't regenerate health.\n\nThe first ruler is the Viper King, he likes to choke and freeze your soldiers. The first time I fought him he focused the special soldier I had for the mission and ran away at half health.\n\nI hadn't lost a soldier at this point mostly due to insane luck. So my six man squad had 4 of the characters from the first mission on it. These include\n\n#Grenadier Cpt Shannon \"Hightower\" O'Toole\n\n#Specialist Cpt Sam \"Warden\" Mondeau\n\n#Ranger Cpt Jake \"Predator\" Corbett\n\n#Sharpshooter Cpt Brent \"Game Time\" Pope\n\n#Sharpshooter Sgt Amy \"Longwalker\" Johanson\n\n#Rookie Ben Ferguson\n\nSo my squad had arrived at the Alien Facility in Northern China and started approaching the center of the compound under the cover of night. We breached the objective room without being spotted and as I was planting the explosives on the objective in walks the Viper King and his bodyguards.\n\nHe was at half health from our previous fight but I had grouped my soldiers up poorly as far as he's concerned. A single frostbite shot could spell doom for my team. So I did the only thing I could do to give myself a chance. I froze him with my only cryobomb, I'd have to do as much damage as I could before he thawed or it'd be a pretty quiet flight back to the Avenger.\n\nJake took a shot with his Magnetic Bolt Caster, it crit, 13 damage later and the Viper was on his last legs, 2 health left, when I realized my mistake. The only person with an action left on my team was Ben, the rookie. This soldier who'd never seen a fight before in his life would either kill the Viper King here or he'd escape and potentially find me in a worse position down the road.\n\nI looked at the shot, 37% chance to hit. There was no way I'd get the kill. Ben wasn't carrying a grenade, and he only had an assault rifle. I fired, and through some miracle despite missing the King he hit the machinery behind him. It was the aliens turn, and the machinery was starting to smoke. The two guards fired at Ben since he was out of cover. He was knocked unconscious. Their turn ended, and the machinery exploded. The King was dead. I extracted my soldiers and made sure Ben got put on the A Squad.\n\nTwo weeks later Squaddie Ben Ferguson the Grenadier was flying out to capture or kill an alien VIP in Boston. The convoy had stopped at a 711 to gas up when our Skyranger touched down. The team filed out, Jake wearing his new Serpent Armor. We approached the VIPs position, Jake using his armors grappling hook to stick to the rooftops. We found the VIP and his escort, there was an unusually large amount of Mutons here for this stage in the game. Not wanting to risk the VIP escaping I had Brent take the shot, once the VIP was dead I expected the enemies to fall back to more defendable positions, it confused me when they charged my line.\n\nTheir assault broke against my elite squad, and soon they all laid dead in the streets, and my men hadn't taken a single hit. But the mission wasn't ending, I figured there was an Advent trooper hiding somewhere so I split my men up to find it. Which made the Berserker Queen bursting throw the wall behind Ben much more terrifying. I had just upgraded his Mag Rifle to have an Hair Trigger and a Repeater. The hair trigger gives you a chance to not use an action when you fire. And the repeater gives you a 5% chance to instantly kill a target. So I had Ben perform a fighting retreat, he ran a couple feet then took a shot. The Repeater went off and the Queen fell back through the hole she had just made. Mission accomplished, Flawless Victory.\n\nWith my recent luck I nearly shit myself when I saw my next mission was to extract a friendly VIP. I moved towards the EVAC point, and I didn't find any enemies. Then I stepped into a courtyard and all the luck that had been with me throughout the campaign ran out in seconds. Elite Mutons had positioned to hold the courtyard, I didn't panic though, all of my men were good at their jobs. \n\nWe fought through the defenders, and killed them to a man. I was out of Medkits, half my squad was below a quarter health, and I had used all my explosives. But the VIP was alive. Then all my built up bad luck showed up at once. The double reinforcements dark event triggered, two squads of Advent would be flanking me next turn. And the final Ruler arrived. The Archon King.\n\nHis entrance was much more terrifying than the Berserker Queens. He flew down from the heavens, grabbed Amy, and dragged her back with him. When he spiked her down to the ground I swear I could feel her bones break. My first casualty. I was mad. And when I realized the VIP counted for the Kings turns I was fucking pissed. \n\nBrent and Jake died next. When his missiles rained from above they couldn't get away. It was down to Shannon, Sam, and Ben. The VIP was nearly at the EVAC point when the King blasted him in the back with a Plasma Beam. He was bleeding out, and Shannon had been caught in the back by an Advent Sharpshooter. She was bleeding out, and she was still in the courtyard. Sam ran back to her, and it shouldn't surprise you that stepping into a known Killzone is a bad call. The hole in his skull proved it. Ben was my last soldier. There was no way I'd kill the King, but maybe if I extracted him and the VIP I could launch a rescue mission to save my soldiers who weren't dead. They escaped. And my elite squad fed the worms. The Archon King is still out there at full health.",

        "text": "A brief one here.\n\nI was running a home-brewed campaign involving the standard \"rescue the old dwarven halls from the [hob]goblin menace!\" dungeon. The party was pretty standard, though the halfling thief decided her... ummm... unmentionables sounded like you were blowing over a bottle whenever she opened her legs. Still, standard stuff otherwise.\n\nAt some point the fighter (name forgotten) decided that he was *super* impressed by the (3rd-level) sorcerer's magic and began to venerate him. This sorcerer's name was, naturally, Tim. He was as good as a 3rd-level sorcerer could be with fire magic.\n\nAt some point Tim died. The player wasn't too impressed with the character so he let him die in a big fight at a river outpost. The fighter, though, became despondent and actually began to worship Tim. \n\nLater, after a check back in at the local large town/small city, they were on their way back to the dungeon. One night they're camping and the fighter decides to \"cast\" his Eye of Tim protection \"spell.\" This spell was actually just lighting 21 torches in a circle at about 15-feet around their campfire. \n\nAnd then I rolled a random encounter. It was ghouls. The person on watch at the time didn't have the best spot check and then you have darkness to contend with. But guess what cancels darkness? Torches giving you a few extra feet of sight outside the campfire's light.\n\nSo the Eye of Tim gave them a few moments more warning, allowing more people to wake up and take part in the fight and relatively easily defeating the ghouls. The fighter swore he would never sleep without the Eye of Tim again and thanked Tim for his protective magic.",

        "text": "I figured I'd share an unexpected PC death from my group's last session.\n\nWe've just started a new occult themed campaign and the party is investigating ghouls appearing in their city.  This is only the third session, so they haven't gotten very far in their investigation and so far they're the only ones who have actually been attacked.\n\nAfter talking to a few knowledgeable NPCs, the group decided to investigate the cemetery to see if anyone has been robbing graves to raise ghouls.  After unintentionally insulting one of the clerics in charge of the cemetery and coming off as a bit crazy by asking if they've had any undead kicking around recently, the group decides to split up to search more efficiently.  All the players take a moment to realize that they've just created the perfect setup for a Scooby Doo episode.  \n\nHomeless Bob the summoner volunteers to search the various family plots with his eidolon in tow.  As the cleric the party spoke to mentioned to them, the family plots aren't open.  They're protected by a 6 foot [wrought iron fence](http://dallasironfence.com/wp-content/gallery/iron-fence/wrought-iron-fence-dallas-1.jpg) and padlocked gates.  Bob has his eidolon attempt to break the padlock and quickly comes to the conclusion that this isn't really feasible.  Undeterred, Bob circles the fence looking for a good place to scale it.  He finds a spot with a mausoleum on the other side and considers having his eidolon throw him over the fence and onto the roof.\n\n\"I roll Intelligence to see if this is a good idea\"\n\nRoll: Nat 1\n\n\"Oh shit.\"\n\n\"The eidolon hoists you up and prepares to throw you.  Roll his Strength check.\"\n\nRoll: Nat 1\n\n\"Oh no!\"\n\nI decide that my description of how this play out requires a visual element, and retrieve a nearby sock monkey to illustrate.\n\n\"Your eidolon attempts to throw you over, but ends up awkwardly flipping you right onto the fence.  Fortunately the spikes that are now impaling your back managed to miss your spine.\"\n\nBob took some serious ability damage from his impaling, but there's not any immediate risk of death.  Bob tries calling for help, but the others are too far away to hear him while they're poking around inside granite mausoleums.  He considers having his eidolon lift him off the fence.  \n\n\"I roll intelligence to see if this can work\"\n\nRoll: 3\n\n\"You think you need to get off this thing now.  If you're going to attempt this, tell me what direction you give your eidolon and then roll his Strength check.\"\n\n\"I don't just tell him to pull me off, I instruct him to lift up as far as he can.\"\n\nRoll: 19\n\nYour eidolon forces you up quite hard, which causes the spike that narrowly missed your spine to snag and cleanly severs your vertebrae.  You realize only too late that brute force was not the answer to this problem.  You pass out from the pain.\n\nWith its master having lost consciousness, Bob's eidolon immediately vanishes.  Since the eidolon was holding Bob in approximately [this position,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Crimson's_suplex_on_Jeff_Jarrett.jpg) Bob falls about 5 feet onto his head.  The party has heard Bob's yelling by this point and is on the way, but it'll be several rounds before they arrive.\n\n\"Go ahead and give me three death saving throws.\"\n\nRoll: 3\n\n\"That's OK, you have to fail all 3 of these to die.  You'll be paralyzed, but you can just become a synthesist summoner or something to walk again.  Roll again.\"\n\nRoll: 3\n\n\"hmm...  third roll?\"\n\nRoll: 9\n\nI pose the sock monkey on the table in the awkward position Bob died in and the rest of the session gets very CSI as the other three party members investigating the scene trying to figure out what the hell happened.  Jimmy, the journalist/psychic medium character, decides that the only way to figure this out for sure is to hold a seance right here an now.  For lack of any better alternatives, the others agree.  After some initial confusion, Bob's spirit confirms the manner of his death.  The group decides to burn the body and leave quickly before anyone notices.  \n\nThe next session will probably involve the party being questioned by the police about a murder at the cemetery in broad daylight.\n\nHomeless Bob had the long term goal of becoming a hobo king and actually spent the beginning of the session riding a dumpster through the streets proclaiming the undead menace to anyone he saw.  I plan to have his ghost haunt that dumpster.",

        "text": "So, yesterday my group of usual players and I finally got our new Shadowrun campaign started. This is our cast:\n\nPC 1: A squatting, human, alcoholic mage who has no idea who or where he is.   \nPC 2: Red Lightning/Leif, a face/samurai adept with (apparently) ties to an eco-terrorist brotherhood   \nPC 3: Duskraider, an ork Street Samurai with a serious hate-on for mages, may be member of a trog-rights group.   \nPC 4: Benjamin, a human adept of the Artisans way, driver and hacker of the group. Currently without streetname, since he never went on a run.   \nPC 5: Garuu, Troll-Bear Shapeshifter who has no clue about technology and is usually oblivious to his surroundings. Until they start hitting him in the face. He's build like a tank, with his adept powers adding another layer of defense to his already formidable muscles.\n\nThis is the story so far:   \nOur first PC is greeted by a splitting headache and an endlessly repeating sound. After he focuses he can finally deceiver a computerized voice endlessly repeating the words: \"Please exit the vehicle.\" He gathers himself and notices that he's lying face up on the floor of a car, with an open door right next to him. He steps out of the vehicle and has no idea where he is. Going away to look around, the annoying voice changes tone and starts repeating \"Please take your luggage with you!\" as the trunk opens. He takes his back and goes in a nearby alley to check his possessions. A shotgun, commlink and a credstick with 180 Nuyen is everything in his possession and he still has no clue who he is. For now, we shall call him HoboDude. HoboDude notices that he is also hungry, in addition to his headache and the feeling that he didn't sleep for the last week. Luckily, a nearby sign draws his attention: \"Stuffer Shack 200m\".\n\nSecond PC gets a call and responds: \"Yes, Brother Leif here?\"   \n\"Brother Stefano here. Brother, one of our contacts is in dire need of urgent assistance and requested a meeting. It's in a Stuffer Shack and you are one closest to it. I know it's unusual, but could you please check it out?\"   \n\"If it furthers the goal of the Brotherhood, may it always prosper.\" Leif ends the call and leaves on his Mirage.\n\nThird PC also gets a call and responds to the AR-Window while rolling out from under the car he just worked on. \"Hello Kestrel. Are you calling because you have news about my dad?\"   \n\"Hello Ben, sadly no. But you said that if I ever need a job done I should call you and I need something done very urgently. Could you meet me at the Stuffer Shack in Potsdam?\"\n\"Sure thing.\"   \n\"Where you still working on that car of yours? You really should get out more, it's Friday evening!\"   \n\"But there's people out there!\"   \nBenjamin responds and looks lovingly at his Hyundai while he ends the call. After giving the sports car a last glance, he takes a seat in an old, beat up Ford Americar and leaves.\n\nForth PC gets a call, too. This one is from his brother: \"Yo bro, what can I do for you?\"   \n\"An old friend needs help with a job and wants to meet up in a Stuffer Shack in Potsdam. Could you go check it out, Duskraider?\"   \n\"Sure, how's the pay?\"   \n\"So far, Kestrel nether disappointed. Be careful, it's in Humanis territory.\"   \n\"Alright, will do!\", the ork responds, grabbing a pistol that appears small in his hands on his way out.\n\nLast PC gets no call. Instead, he opens his fridge to find empty space and sadness. His growling stomache underlines the need for nourishment, which is why he also makes his way to the nearest Stuffer Shack.\n\n*****\n\nEveryone has arrived, 4 figures are having a short get together at the side opposite to the entrance while 2 others stand in front of the nuker. HoboDude is furious, as the nuker just won't open to cook his food: \"Please activate your SIN before making a purchase\", it repeats. The troll behind him is still hungry and pushes him to the side, opening the microwave/ofen and throwing one of his 6 pizzas into it.   \n\"Hey, it seems that my Commlink has troubles broadcasting my SIN, could you buy me a pizza? I will give you the money for it!\", HoboDude says while waving a credstick at the troll. \"Sure thing, buddy.\" Another pizza is thrown into the ofen and 5 Nuyen change owner.\n\nIn the corner, Kestrel starts explaining why he has gathered 3 people who have never known each other in a Stuffer Shack of all places. Apparently, he still owns a favor to a Herr Schmidt (which is the german equivalent to Mr. Johnson), said Schmidt really needs a job done and soon! With currently no free runner teams on his hand, he wants us, that is Leif, Ben and Duskraider to do the job. It should be a simple thing, an ex-employee stashed a datachip in a stuffer shack and we should retrieve it. Before he can explain the rest of the job, the sound of shattered glass can be heared through the whole store.\n\n5 humans enter the store, all except one have shaved heads and every single one of them wears a shirt with prints like \"The world belongs to the humans!\" \"Trogs are monsters\" \"Fuck the leaf-eaters\" and similar stuff. The group in the back corner can't really see what is going on since there are shelves in the way, but the 2 guys at the nuker are have a straight line of sight to the entrance. Spotting the troll, the leader of the Humanis gang spouts: \"We heared there's filth in our territory!\" and trains his heavy pistol on the troll. Two loud bangs resonate in the store and the ganger looks on in shock as his first round leaves barely a mark on the thick troll skin while his second misses alltogether, going into the nuker and obliterating the pizza inside.\n\nHoboDude is understandably furios because his food was ruined and turns to the gangers. He raises his hands and all hell breaks lose. A short blue flash can be seen around him, then a giant red-colored flash as a lake of napalm decends upon the gangers and the troll infront of him.   \n&gt;Speaking in game terms: HoboDudes player never played a mage and wanted to see what was possible. So he casted a Force 10 Napalm spell. To put that into perspective: The leader of the wild hunt, one of the most powerful spirits in the world is a force 9 spirit. Usual spellcasting happens from Force 2 to Force 5.   \n\n3 out of 5 gangers disintegrate instantly, one of the other two is barely standing and both survivors are burning. The troll takes a staggering amount of damage, considering that he just took a bullet from basically a Desert Eagle without flinching and the mage is thrown to the floor bleeding heavily because of the drain of the spell. The Human Supremist in reasonably good condition runs out of the store, still on fire. The other one collapses and a third bang echoes through the store as his grenade cooks of. The entrance of the store is now covered in burning napalm, with a small crater and cracks in the ceiling where the last ganger stood. Sprinklers are trying to drench the fire but only make it worse.\n\n\"Change of plans!\", Kestrel shouted. \"I know that I'm going to regret that, but grab your new muscle and let's leave!\" After some difficulties (namely, the troll being on fire and turning into a bear, Leif being disoriented and staggering around in the smoke-filled store for a while and HoboDude being close to death) everyone stands at the back exit of the burning, smoking Stuffer Shack. Instead of doing the reasonable thing, namely legging it and getting out of here accusations start flying and claims of compensation for destroyed items get thrown around between HoboDude, Garuu and Leif. Kestrel conferes to the 2 apparently still sane people, Benjamin and Duskraider that the team has to clean up the mess that was caused just now before they can go on the run he called them for. Then he gets on his chopper, leaving them to their own devices.\n\nFinally, after oscillating lights could be seen through the smoke and sirens heared in the distance, the team managed to set their differences aside and piled into Benjamins old Americar, the troll taking the back seat basically for himself, with the now unconscious make besides him, nearly suffocating under his arm. Duskraider rode shotgun and Leif had his own bike.\n\nWhile Benjamin got lucky and had a clean get away, Leif soon saw a blinking alert in his AR-Vision. \"Sternenschutz. Please stop your vehicle immediately and wait for officers to arrive.\" (Sternenschutz is the german equivalent to Lonestar) He would have chosen to ignore the alert, but noticed the drone that was chasing him and kept him in it's search light. He pulled over and got of his bike, immediately starting his act of \"panicking civilian in distress\", pacing next to his motorcycle and muttering to himself. A SWAT-Van rolled past him, heading for the smoke silhouette about a block away. Right behind it was a single cop on a scouter who stopped next to Leif and began to question him. Fooled by the act, he sent the poor civilian home to get some rest without even taking a copy of his SIN or registering the cylces license plate.\n\n*****\n\nThat's basically all for now, editing the security footage was a piece of cake thanks to some lucky matrix rolls and we called the session.\n\nThis has been the most fucked up version of food fight that I ever witnessed.",
