Worried about the hugs and such, and I wanna know how to explain to grandparents and other family that she isn't being rude but no hugs and, to quote a great emperor ”no touchy\", and how also to explain she's going to be shut in the spare room playing her games most of the time. But that's how she deals.\nAny help will be appreciated.. thank you",

This includes school and work, leaving me unable to hold a job or make friends. For a while when I was a teenager the diagnosis was agoraphobia but has since changed to panic disorder as I did not have a lot of the thoughts associated with agoraphobia. In fact, I very rarely have any thoughts associated with my panic attacks. They are primarily a very physical experience. \nI was recently deemed treatment resistant by my psych as the countless types of therapies and medications do very little to help. I’ve even tried ketamine therapy and found no relief. I discovered about 6 years ago that there was a high possibility that I am autistic and my current therapist is questioning if I even have panic disorder or if it is autism or adhd. I guess my question is how do I know if I’m having autistic meltdowns, shutdowns, or panic attacks? And how do I cope? I would really like to be able to go out and find community but my condition prevents me a lot of the time :(",

Are they “unusual” autistic ones or do you feel they are closer to an allistic experience? Do you see yourself in/have any observation about what follows?\n\n- I have recently become aware of various sound sensitivities I have, going from feeling confused in crowded rooms to bordering misophonia; I’ve had them for years, who knows since when, but I have picked on them maybe just months ago. Until then, I had assumed that was how life was meant to be and rarely noticed problems with noises. Sometimes I am “afraid” I’ve made them up.\n\n- My parents told me that I’ve seldom got meltdowns as a baby/child. Notably, I didn’t cry in circumstances in which kids are often expected to do so (denial of a toy and especially lack of sleep).\n\n- When I was a child my speech was advanced for my age, and my mother says I came off like if I wanted to impress people. I read this way of talking can be a result of echolalia, but I have not found proof that was the case for me. Instead, I had noticeable palilalia (persisting in adulthood!).\n\n- In general, I am inclined to believe I have no problem with eye contact, but I have some weird memories on the matter. Once I forgot how to not stare at the interlocutor right in the middle of a conversation and from then on I find myself needing to avert the look mechanically at times.\n\n- I have learned to exaggerate facial expressions for masking, but what I am trying to hide is not a lack of thereof, quite the contrary: if I don’t pay attention people tend to know immediately what’s going through my mind in a given moment just by looking at my face (sometimes they even get it better than I do!) and that has put me in very embarrassing situations. \n\nThank you for any answer!",

I'm always confused about whether to handshake, bump fists (corona greeting), hug or do the Italian cheek kiss thing. It's not as simple as: Italian = kiss kiss, German = handshake, American = hug. No, it's all mixed up no matter what.\n\nIs there a way that I can control the salutation? I always feel like it's the other person who decides and I just have to go along with it. I'd love to act like Wednesday Addams and back away from the huggers and kissers, but I don't think people would understand that.\n\nIdeally, what I'd like to do is to simply wave and say goodbye. If that isn't enough for the other person and they want to do some kind of touchy goodbye, I'll just go along with it and accept that it might be awkward. \n\nIs this a masking issue or am I getting the idea wrong?",

        "text": "Hi All, I (30y/o female) went through a diagnosis which consisted of DIVA, RAADS-R and a long form about my issues and history, followed by a 3h in-person interview with neuro tests. It had to be a differential diagnosis as my psychiatrist suspected borderline which I disagree with. Even though I scored 148 on RAADS-R and have lots and lots of autistic traits, my diagnosis is 'no neurodivergence, poorly developed personality.' My high score in RAADS is attributed to personality disorders because the person running the diagnosis said 'people on the spectrum usually score around 100'. She told me I had mostly narcissistic personality disorder with some traits of antisocial, borderline and obsessive-compulsive, so basically I am a walking cluster B diagnosis. \n\nShe was also worried about my performance and suggested going to a neurologist, because I made many mistakes on some tests. Fam, I didn't get full instructions, no one told me I had to do things in left-to-right order or otherwise it would count as a mistake. I also tested lots of approaches because this is what I'm required to do at work in IT. I literally had an MRI last week, and everything's fine with my brain, I'm just burned out. \n\nI am also extremely well-masked. Apparently, the diagnosis was very complicated and required additional supervision because even though I scored high in all RAADS sections, I am very good with language. She also said: 'people on the spectrum usually maintain their stress level throughout the interview and you came in stressed and chilled out' and 'I think you score yourself much lower than what you are in reality.' Yeah, sure, but at what cost do I maintain this reality for you?\n\nI was so happy when I figured out I might be on the spectrum because looking at my life through this lens explained so much and helped me accept myself and my limitations. I was so happy when I found out that rocking makes my anxiety and stress go away (though it also made me angry because the answer to so many problems was so close all this time).\n\nI will ask her for more explanation regarding a high RAADS score as a disordered personality thing, but have you ever heard of something like that? I am tempted to look for a second opinion or just convince myself that my self diagnosis is correct and I don't need a professional opinion. Still, I need to hear about others' experiences first. Also, please hug me :(",

But I'm interviewing my family about childhood traits and behaviors and while their answers are validating my assumption I just found myself wondering if I'm just delusional to think I'm autistic. I wonder if people around me are going to think I'm just hopping on the trend cuz it's the new hot thing. \n\nI worried about that when I came out as nonbinary too. I've always felt queer and bi despite being AFAB and always dating AMABS but I didn't have the concept of agender until recently (well, 5 years ago). Funny enough it was a TERF that helped me realize it. I didn't even know what a TERF was at the time, despite having lots of trans friends. This person told me they were gender critical and I was like \"oh yeah me too, I don't even think I have a gender\"  🤣🤣🤣 Anyways the conversation turned and it started making me feel sick to my stomach so I then learned what TERFS were and I was pretty creeped out. \n\nAnyways, my whole life is starting to make sense and I'm crying all the time, I can barely make it 10 minutes at a time through Unmasking Autism without falling apart. \n\nBut I just really want people in my life to believe me and see me and accept me but I'm so scared. My mom said I am just trying to be a victim, and it's so hard not to internalize her abusive words. (There's more than that, she has a whole rehearsed tirade she repeats every time I see her every year or two). \n\nWow thanks for reading all this if you got this far.

And I’m spiraling because now I have another thing to figure out.\n\nI’m definitely very awkward, but I don’t have too much trouble with conversations. I can miss some social cues here and there but I understand and use gestures and facial expressions, although it does feel forced. I can make eye contact but I tend to jump around with my gaze a lot and have a habit of staring. I can tell when people are upset, or mad, or frustrated. I can have some conversations that make me seem completely normal, but I can also be very awkward with some. Overall it could just be social awkwardness, I don’t know.\n\nI wouldn’t call myself very empathetic, but I do get very angry about unfairness or cruelty towards children and animals. I don’t really resonante with avoiding violent TV, but that might just be because I’ve seen so much real gore online that I’m desensitized to it. I’m not great at comforting people but I definitely do try if I am in the right mental state for it.\n\nI don’t have meltdowns, but I do get very overstimulated when I’m in a place with too much noise. I usually hold it in which kind of translates it into a shutdown instead, and I’m always exhausted after. But I don’t get overstimulated extremely often, and I can put up with it if I can’t leave.\n\nI don’t know, I guess I’m just frustrated. I’ve already spent so long trying to figure out if my symptoms were just related to my ADHD, and now I have another thing to question myself over. I feel like every time I figure one thing out, three more things pop up.\n\nIf possible, can someone tell me the definitive differences between being an HSP vs being autistic? I’m sorry for ranting, this kind of turned into a half-vent/rant half-query. I’m just tired.",

Also, I clarify that Spanish is my first language so I'm sorry of misspellings or anything like that.\n\nSo. I've been suspecting to have echolalia, and I'm aware that it's normal for autistic people to also be diagnosed with echolalia... I honestly don't know if there's a sub/community solely for this but tbh I feel a lot more comfortable asking things in this community. ANYWAY I'm here to lists all the reasons why I'm doubting and I hope that someone with echolalia here wants to comment saying \"yes, I do the same things\" or maybe \"no, you are just delusional\". Here we go:\n\n- When I was little, I recall that when seeing movies with my parents (it's a tradition, we do this every weekend sense years) I would repeat out loud the lines from the film, mostly the funny ones because I always had comedy as my favorite genre and I suppose the lines would make me so happy I repeated them on the instant. I mostly remember this because my parents would be really annoyed at me and ask me to shut up (never did).\n\n- Other thing from childhood is that I repeated word for word the last sentence of a conversation (I repeated the words of others and myself), mostly the ones where I was participating, but sometimes if I was paying attention I would do it. I don't remember repeating with the same level of voice I do when speaking normally, I think I whispered it? I think I just didn't care so my volume would change depending the moment.\n\n- I actually tried to suppress this last thing because my sister would point that out and I felt so embarrassed at the moment (I was aware I was doing it, but I just thought no one would care enough to ask me so I never stopped me) that I decided to try to stop myself. It was a long process but until this day (more than a couple of years passed) I don't fully control it and I repeat mostly my last sentences when I'm very angry.\n\n- Idk if this counts? But since I started stopping myself, my thoughts increased a lot more than before, in the way that I repeat all that I hear in my head word for word. It was something I did before but now it's almost constantly following every word someone says in my head and even repeating one specific sentence over and over and over for hours to the point I feel overwhelmed. \n\n- I stim a lot throughout the day, I'm more of a movement/touchy stimmer (flapping hands, touching specific fabric that I like, rocking back and forth, do a little rhythmic/repetitive dance only moving my hips and so on) but when I don't, I start making sounds that I like how they feel when do them, like:\n\nDoing that typical clock sound with my tongue, little sounds when happy, I do a \"monch monch monch\" out loud while eating something that I really like (yes, eating with mouth open, it's gross, I know) and sometimes I just repeat the word \"vamo'\" (spanish for \"let's go\") in a specific tone when I'm out of my house hanging with friends even when I don't actually want to move anywhere.\n\n- I sometimes just repeat the sounds I hear on the street consciously because I want to, like a dog barking, someone using the horn of their car or the awful sound of motorcycles.\n\nI hope I'm not braking any rules on this sub. But anyway, thank you for reading all my stuff, I please encourage you to comment your opinions on this (if you want to, obviously).",

I was so obsessed that my parents and uncles would often say to me \"there's more to life than cars!\" because all I was talking about was cars, vehicles and so on.\n\nI learned to write and read at 1.5 years old and my mom told me how I used to try to read the stories she was telling me instead of listening to them. She's also stunned how much detail I remember about my first memory which happened when I was less than 2: how I remember we were in a swimming pool which was below the level of a parking where a VW Polo with alloy rims was parked and so on.\n\nI always pay big attention to the cars' licence plates on the road, even when I'm driving\n\nI was never good at math but I have crazy amount of statistics saved on notepad files on my computer. Latest example: I spent so much time on collecting statistics on old results on offshore powerboat racing that I ended up with carpal tunnel syndrome due to constant navigation to find the spreadsheets and etc. \n\nIn addition to that I pay big attention to dates, I love to situate an event (like a F1 race) in a my mental chronology.\n\nAt school I was always left out, always rejected and seeing my classmates behave like they were was making cringe a lot.\n\nI'm still able to function normally in society but I was always seen as weird by my pairs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the messy post, I was writing as the thoughts were coming by. Thanks in advance",

I've had it worst, but going to the doctor was super tiring. \n\nMy mom ended up helping me buy the right meds, I need to get 4 different ones. They didn't have them at the right dose. I need to check different stores. God this stupid shit hots worst than most things that are supposed to be difficult.\n\nThankfully, once you buy the meds from the app you don't have to wait too long in line. But it started raining, so a car ride would be pretty useful.\n\nSince my mom is here and she's the only person with a car/driver's license, it would save a lot if she could give me a ride. And I felt so guilty over asking her for all this help, but at this point she really could just go to the register.\n\nI really didn't want to leave my room. I was so tired. And my grandma asked her to buy some extra stuff, meaning there'd be more waiting and things to ask vendors. And there was pretty much nothing I could do to help.\n\nI even caught a bunch of raining opening the garage door for my mom -- which I wouldn't have if I had opened the door from the inside. The doctor did tell me to avoid something like that.\n\nWell, idk what your opinions are. Cos I felt super distressed with the whole experience, but I'm definitely in debt to my mom here. She was doing a bunch of stuff for me, and all she wanted was for me to follow her through this chore. I think she was inconsiderate about how much worse the chore is for me, but I get really really mad about going through this stuff when I'm not helping. She could've asked me to cook dinner, do her dishes, just saying that I owe her help in whatever. But she wanted to drag me with her and settle things.\n\nI hate NT logic. But my mom is still a 6/10, and I do owe her.",

I want very badly to accessorize and get pretty things I can use to play with and make me feel better through the day but currently the only accessory I can stand is a lanyard or necklaces (I wear a sunflower lanyard and sometimes a necklace, but I don't like necklaces that much because there aren't really colorful ones that aren't super girly). I can't stand socks, jewelry, or basically anything that touches my skin. And I can't layer much because I overheat extremely easily. Are there any kinds of accessories (other than a backpack, which I already have a rainbow one!) that I could add to my outfits that could add color, childish patterns, or cartoon characters or such that wouldn't touch my skin or nails? Makeup and nail polish lead to meltdowns. It's also really hard to find things that don't look bad on a bigger body - like belt chains and stuff usually just look silly on me.",

I can’t journal or write/type personal feelings because it always feels like I’m writing it addressed to someone or like someone will pick it up and read it after I’m done. It’s frustrating because though I know there really isn’t anyone there, I still can’t express myself and write down my direct thoughts and feelings. I find myself changing subtle things I do to fit as if someone was watching and analyzing my every move, for example, doing something unnecessary or extra to ‘make me look like a good person’, even when there’s no one around. When I’m home alone, in the car, in a room with no one else, I still feel like I’m being watched.

Well, the title pretty much sums it up: it seems to be very clear that I am autistic. The truth is that this is not a thought I'm having only now, It's something that have been on my mind ever since I was a kid, but I would just shake it off no matter how many times It would come up, in part because I did not fit in with the stereotypes tv series presented, in part because because I thought people would just roll their eyes at me if I talked about it. Well, now I am really stopping and giving it genuine time, thought and research and yes, it does seem to correspond A LOT with my experience, how I feel and felt, my behaviors, etc.\nHere is where things get kinda spicy: I already have another diagnostic. It states that I have schizoaffective disorder and Persistent Depression... And I think with the whole autism thing, it gets kinda tricky, yes? I have in fact had psychotic episodes, and I definitely am depressed af most of the time, but I also I am now thinking some of the experiences I may have experienced could have been meltdowns, burnouts, etc. Tricky, huh?\nAnd I have to figure that all out while having absolutely no money or idea of what to do with my life because I kinda seem to not be able to function properly with people anymore. Things are overwhelming me too easily so it's very hard to think of something I would realistically be able to do. At least I'm not locked in my room anymore since yesterday. Small victories, I suppose.\nI don't know if that is me self-diagnosing. Honestly, I kinda wish it was, but I don't feel safe enough to do that, social movements are dealt with differently here in Brazil, and I am graduated in Psychology so people would really get on my back if I did that.",

Sometimes the colors are too overwhelming or there isn't enough contrast.

In some maps, I can go in and change the background colors of the scenery from red or orange to blue or lavender and that makes a huge difference.\n\nIn other cases, adjusting the brightness and saturation on the monitor makes colors more visible which is good, but the screen is overall too bright.\n\nSometimes my brain gets hung up on the colors and lack of contrast and I just can't play. Others don't seem to have a problem.\n\nIn the sport game I play, there are two teams: red team and blue team. I have a hard time differentiating the colors at a distance and it messes up my game. I need more contrast in the colors. Either no one else has a problem or no one is openly talking about it. My guess is that they have the brightness, contrast, and saturations turned up on their monitors. I can't do that. I see too much \"garbage\" in the screen when I do that. I can't explain what \"garbage\" is, but I believe it's something that neurotypicals are able to tune out.\n\nI just want to make sure this is all a legitimate issue involving sensory processing disorder. I intend to ask the developers to make an accessibility pack or options for players who have issues with the colors.\n\nFor what it's worth, apparently I can change the team colors, but it involves editing the source code from GitHub and then compiling the code myself. That's way above my skill level, I usually just download the Zip file and install the game from there.",

I still might go for the official diagnosis, but it's either expensive or a long wait and a pain in the rear.\n\nSo I talked with my Aunt about it the other day and she found it really interesting and we talked about some of the diagnostic criteria and about how many people in my family could meet those criteria even more than I do. \n\nApart from my cousin's son who is officially diagnosed, we're just a generally quirky family. If you someone asks the room if they're hungry for dinner, everyone looks at their watch before responding. We've got several cases of highly intelligent people who somehow couldn't manage career, family and friends and they now basically live alone pursuing their special interests. I have a great uncle who was very creative but \"couldn't deal with people\" and got lobotomized because of his behavior &amp; \"explosions\". \n\nAlso, this group has been helpful in posting common autistic traits that I also see reflected in me and my family. A recent one was the idea that many people on the spectrum don't miss people when they're gone and forget to keep in touch. I contact my family about once or twice a year, and they don't contact me any more frequently that I do.  \n\nI could go on and list so many things, but this post is just kind of a thank you to the things I've learned from reading posts in this group.\n\nDid anyone else have the experience of getting diagnosed and then recognizing the traits in other family members? Did you tell them?\n\nSo far, I've just written to a family to say that I got this diagnosis and focussed on explaining characteristics that he could also relate to.",

That might explain why I was so uncomfortable using it around other people, and why it made me feel trapped in a prison within my mind while in social situations. \nI've noticed that I'm doing a lot more obvious stimming behaviors even while sober though.\nI've seen studies linking thc usage during pregnancy to higher rates of autism, as well as thc usage posing higher risk of psychosis in autistic people. A few of my close family members also have a history with thc, as well as inexplicable behaviors manifesting in recent years.\nHowever, one thing that sort of throws a wrench into all of this, is my suspicion of jinni influence (jinn referring to unseen entities living in our world, called different names across cultures and languages). Now I fully understand that some skeptics will chalk it entirely up to psychosis or something else as soon as I mention the immaterial/metaphysical. For me however, my mind is still capable of rational and logical deduction, and I have personal conviction in a religious framework based on tangible evidences and logical arguments. So I believe the Truth can lie somewhere in between.\nAnyways, I have reasons to believe there may be demonic/jinni influence within my family/personal life. I recently, seemingly out of nowhere, developed a hyperfocused interest in demonology, the study of and documentation of specific unseen entities. I became aware that within certain magick schools of thought, substances like thc and others are believed to open humans up to easier interaction/communication with these entities.\nLong story cut short, I've had numerous occurances around me that have led me to believe that possession has occurred in my life, although I'm not quick to chalk everything up to that. Like I said, I believe truth lies in the middle. Honestly I'm anticipating some people on here to outright tell me I'm experiencing psychosis.\nBut these experiences only really happen to me with such vividness when I'm alone, and I'm still able to function normally for work. Which makes me wonder where the unmasking begins and ends, and where the potential for possession/psychosis begins and ends.\n\nIf anyone else here believes in the unseen, I'm curious to hear your input especially, but obviously I'm open to all perspectives. I just don't like to be talked to as if I'm rationally inferior for believing in certain realities based on real inference.",

That is totally how it feels to be me.

What if I where lame in both legs, but, by the power of my will, somehow was able to walk around and “pass” as someone who could walk? Because the immense pain of walking would be hidden for other people they would not understand why I was always more grumpy and tired than other walking people. I would not understand myself either. Not having access to other people’s feelings I wouldn’t know that other people didn’t hurt as much as me everyday.\n\nThis text is a work en progress.

I (F26) have been doing some personal research and consuming a fair amount of media to try and figure out why I act the way I do. I thought perhaps my troubles with social interactions would lessen as I grew older but I still find myself stimming, masking, overall just feeling so guilty because I feel as though I can’t function like others do. My meltdowns have either lead to me becoming angry to the point of saying hurtful things or becoming so upset that I go non verbal and hold a comfort item. I have compiled a list of things I suspect might be autistic traits which I will post on a separate post but here is one thing.\n\n Just today my sisters and I were visiting my mother to help with deep cleaning when my older sister (F32) pulled out the vacuum cleaner. Im sure you see where this is going. I explained I needed to leave the room before she turned it on because I didn’t like the noise and she replied “ok well I don’t like it either and I’m fine” as if I was being dramatic, to which I replied, “yes but the difference is you don’t actively avoid vacuuming because of that, do you?” I have to force myself to  wear earphones when I do vacuum once every few months because if I don’t I start feeling on edge. It stresses me out and the fact that she was so quick to dismiss me upset me.\n\nI personally don’t think a neurotypical person would get like this about something that happened hours ago. I don’t know if my list will help but I just need to know if I’m wrong for thinking I may be on the autistic spectrum.",

I've had a few cries in private this past year, during times of prayer. But today was different. Normally I get home and drink some evening coffee so I can have the energy for screen time (sleeping feels like a waste of time to me and I try to minimize the amount I get to the bare minimum; I regularly sleep 4-5 hours before work). But once I got inside behind closed doors, all I had the energy for was to lie down and stare at nothing. Then the thoughts became overwhelming and I started thinking about how isolated I've felt my entire life, because I've never actually had any close autistic friends (none that I'm aware of). I began sobbing practically uncontrollably. I fought the urge to pull my hair, and all I could do was huddle close to the ground and tuck my head low, to try and become as small as possible I guess.\nI have a half brother who is likely on the spectrum, because he's been non verbal for a long time, and I immediately recalled his meltdown moments and I had strong urges to stim like he would. I mirrored him, and I could immediately empathize with his inner frustrations and loneliness, which only made me feel even worse. He's a toddler, I'm 22. Years ago when he was still an infant, I would become frustrated with him as well as my little half-sister who is a year older than he is. I had no clue I was likely on the spectrum back then, but looking back, I was having meltdowns then as well. But I would be tasked with babysitting the two of them, sometimes for up to 8, 9, or even 10 hours until late at night. I was a highschooler at the time. My memories of lashing out at them from overwhelm makes me hate myself more. I have no idea if my sister is on the spectrum too. Just from the sheer amount of loneliness I've felt in these brief 22 years, I hope she isn't. And I really hope my little brother has the opportunities to make friends similar to himself that I didn't have, because I don't wish this isolation upon him.\n\nAll in all I'm coming to terms with my real self, the one that I've unconsciously buried inside for most of my life. I have thoughts of giving up completely almost daily now, but I guess the one thing that stops me from doing so is conviction in the afterlife, and fear of Divine Punishment for giving up.\n\nI need to meet more autistic people.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, Im 25 Female (ASD &amp; OCD), diagnosed last week. Not sure where to start, but I've suspected I was autistic for about a year now. \n\nI say \"suspected\", but to be honest I just *knew* after about a week of researching it.  As I dived further into Autism research it was so hyperspecific to my life and experiences that it was almost creepy. When I told my family that I was going to go through the diagnostic process I could tell that their reaction was \"here we go again\" because they know I can become \"obsessive\" about subjects and I'm always looking for the \"why.\"\n\nWhile I wasn't surprised at my diagnosis, I was incredibly relieved, ecstatic, triumphant, and genuinely hopeful for the first time in my entire adult life. I thought my family was being supportive, I mean it was heavily suggested that my brothers were on the spectrum when they were children, so it's not like this was some wild crazy theory I had come up with. Even my Dad related to a lot of the experiences that many Autistic people share, so I just thought that they were going to be supportive. \n\nButttttttttt when I told them my diagnosis, all excited and hopeful after years of low-level burnout and 6 months of weekly, sometimes daily meltdowns that have been.....damaging (to say the least), they were not so thrilled. One family member responded, \"well whether you have it or you don't, you're very capable and life is hard for everyone. It doesn't define you, try and think about this positively, you've gone through worse.\" (Which was genuinely just so confusing that I ended up shutting down. The sibling I thought I was closest to just kind of...hung up on me. Even the family members that are \"supportive\" (they keep referring to me as high-function even when I try to correct them) haven't watched or read a single resource on what Autism actually IS, instead of the stereotype they know it to be. Which is funny since I tried to send them the shortest most digestible resources I could find. \n\nIt just hurts because they'll watch each other's movies and listen to song recommendations, and read entire novels they've suggested to each other, but not a single one of them has bothered to look at anything I've sent them. They've always been like that with me, I guess I just thought because this is life-changing for me they would at least *try.* I'm used to feeling misunderstood, but at least I could usually communicate clearly (unmasked) with them *to some extent*. But now I just feel the same infuriating level of being misunderstood that I've always felt with friends and other people, by them too.\n\nI think the most frustrating part about all of this is that when I told one sibling that I was trying to unmask he literally told me to read this book on how to make friends. I respectfully declined which turned into him asking why I bother talking to him. I ended up speaking with another sibling about it and he starts saying how that book changed his life and defended it after telling me that I didn't \"look autistic\" and that he \"hadn't gotten\" to any of the resources I had sent.\n\nI guess it's just starting to hit me how little attention they give to me. Even when my dad filled out the parent evaluation for my psychiatrist, he just ended up talking about my brothers...Even my Grandmother said that she's glad Im getting evaluated so that I can \"finally realize what a good dad\" my father is. \n\nI know a lot of other late diagnosed Autistic people have very similar experiences, I just didn't expect them to be this (directly) invalidating. For the first time in my life, I'm starting to consider no contact. I knew I was often disregarded by them because I'm the only girl, but like, this is honestly ridiculous and I don't want to give them more opportunities to make the diagnosis feel unreal or like a curse instead of a chance to understand and properly support myself, and for the first time, have a community. \n\nHas anyone else gone no contact ? if so, what was/is it like? Any advice?",

Now with my ( suspected ) ASD side, im not smart instead I have a specific learning disability ( it was never specified in my IED ) and I damn near failed every year and hated learning cause it was too difficult and fast paced, I don't over analyze social situations im more quiet and wait for the other person speak first cause idk what to say in most conversations, I understand body language but I barely react to them, I do not speak formal I speak with slang, im not strict to routine or schedule, I rarely ever talked about my obsessive interests with my friends cause I knew they weren't into the same home activities I was into, I never did my stims in front of people instead my body was more motionless, I was quiet cause I didn't want to draw attention to myself cause I hate attention it makes me feel uncomfortable and I feel exposed,  im very quiet even around my own family, but when im with friends im more talkative but I hide pieces of my personality with each friend group I had. I have only 1 friend now and we talk from time to time, which im happy, cause having to socialize all the time is annoying. Do you guys relate and have similar experience to mine?",

I’ve barely been going to classes, or walking to the shop so I can feed myself properly. Walking out in public causes me so much internal distress, and I literally try so hard to suppress it so those around me don’t think I’m insane. I just ordered a ham and cheese panini from the library cafe (basically survived off of these all of last year, it’s all I ate everyday for lunch). The sweat was pooling on my forehead, I noticed as I was standing in the queue that I was super stiff and anxious about what others may think of me. Also, I sort of tried to walk through a closing door. It’s one of those electric-powered ones, I guess? I didn’t care, and didn’t even notice it was shutting. All I cared about was rushing to sit down in my study space so I can calm down a little. I saw a few people look at me when it happened, and my god, I just wanted to be cremated right there. I find myself zoning out, and as I was waiting for my panini to be heated up, I literally felt like my body was moving/swaying? Thouch Im pretty sure it wasn’t? I literally also had a thought like “omg am I actually going to have a meltdown here in front of everybody?”. I swear to god, I was on the verge. Man this is just so exhausting and I can’t keep doing this anymore. It makes my quality of life pretty poor (I hope I don’t sound like I’m exaggerating). I feel like crying right now.

I had planned the call so carefully and obviously it didn't go like I planned but I now have to fill in a questionnaire at the doctor's surgery this lunchtime and then talk to her one or two more times so she can fill in the referral forms with me.\n\nProbably positive in general but all I can think after calls is how awkward and weird I came across and I  have all this pent up energy and weird feelings in my body. Hopefully later I can be glad.\n\nLove to you all.",

        "text": "Hi, I'm posting this on a couple of autism/neurodiversity subs because I'm curious about what some different communities/people think of it.\n\nOne of the first things my psych said was:\n\n\"Your struggles are consistent with people with ASD, but they aren't bad enough for a diagnosis.\"\n\nAlso because I didn't have social issues when I was 4-5 or something. Its been chalked up to anxiety and hyperintelligence, although we didn't discuss my sensory issues at all so idk what's going on there.\n\nHe said if he was to make a diagnosis it would be high functioning Asperger's but Asperger's isn't a  separate diagnosis anymore its just a label under autism's umbrella so idk what to make of that? And he didn't diagnose it anyway he just said I could think of it as that or something. My struggles have been attributed to anxiety and my above average intelligence bc my intelligence in all areas was either just above or well above average for my age so my social struggles are supposedly bc of that or something but no diagnosis's for anxiety either as far as I can tell but I am talking to my pediatrician tomorrow and a pediatrician is required for a diagnosis of anything so I suppose I'll see tomorrow.\n\nHowever I have enough of a social deficit that he said i need to do work w my speech pathologist and/or my psych and possibly join a social skills group (of autistic people) bc I struggle with that but its not bad enough to be diagnosed autistic I'm just like...huh\n\nWe've also previously ruled out ADHD because I don't disrupt the classroom or something according to my teachers that had to answer questions but he said if my attention issues persist or get worse or something we'll reassess?\n\nAnd I have to do an overall disorders questionnaire for him to look at.\n\nHe also said he's sending my report and we can go over anything I disagree with next session but yeah.\n\nBut yeah he said my struggles are consistent w autistic but not bad enough for a diagnosis, and expressly said I'm neurotypical.\n\nObviously I don't want a debilitating disorder but the fact that everything I find hard is consistent with the symptoms of it but I can't receive a diagnosis and the community and accommodations that come with it because I am not struggling hard enough is just kind of disappointing, although based on how he was discussing potential results after my cognitive and giftedness and all that I'm not surprised.\n\nTLDR; I have ASD symptoms but they're not bad enough to be diagnosed",

        "text": "I think that when NT talks they don't give all the information that's necessary to understand a story and so I often end up confused or not understanding what they've just said. But, I seem to be the only one affected by it because everyone else in the group seems to have been able to follow the story just fine.\n\nI have a few examples of this: I remember when I was a teenager my friends and I used to have a group chat and sometimes we'd all be online at the same time chatting. The message I would send the most was \"wait, what? I'm confused\" because they kept changing topics very often but never addressed when the topic had changed, so I was always confused cos I thought we were talking about subject A but they were discussing subject C already. I seem to have been the only one confused by this.\n\nThen, at family dinners my family often tells stories and I'm never able to follow them because they don't provide enough context. They talk about Robin. Who's Robin? Was it a friend of yours? How old were you when this happened? It would be a different story if you were 15 or 25 when this happened. Were you dating dad by this point?  I feel they leave out details that aren't necessary relevant to the story, but that are relevant to understand the context in which this happened. After these stories I often end up with more questions than anything else.\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?",

        "text": "So I was watching a part of the Moomin show, which a Finnish animation, anyway while watching it, a character in it always tells the truth of the matter in things. It reminded me of when I was a child, and how brutally honest I am. Anyway, the memory is this: my family was invited to dinner, and so I had to go and I was about 9 years old, I hate almost all food, so odds are I am not going to like the meal. I will not lie though, my parents told me before I go not to be rude, to which I said I will not be rude, but I will tell them if I like it or not. So what this means to my parents is I am going to absolutely tell them the food is not to my liking. Anyway, we get there, the woman asked me if I was ready for the meal and told me what it is and can not wait to see if I like it... My Mother stopped her right there with my dad and said: No, He will not like it, he likes nothing, do not ask, he will not lie. The lady was a bit shocked, but rolled with it, I just shrugged and went yup, I will not lie, but that means if I like it, it means you know i am not lying either.  It was a nice dinner, but I did not like it, They asked, and I just said nope, lol and my family said see! We told ya, the person just laughed, and so did my family, I smiled, and when we left my family still had a couple chuckles over it. Sometimes  \n\n\nEither way, it was funny to hear my parents say that straight up to people and me not having to explain it. Either way, I thought my parents handled it very well for a somewhat difficult problem with most people. I had a few othertimes where that happened. But either way, it made me think of some of the traits often associated with Autism and how a lot of people look at it so negatively, but it really does not need to be looked at so negatively. I am also glad my parents did not ask me to lie, or discouraged such behavior on my part growing up.   \n\n\nAnyway, any of you have some stories like this? Perhaps of things that were nicer in nature? Maybe reading this story might have jogged your memory of something like that perhaps?",
