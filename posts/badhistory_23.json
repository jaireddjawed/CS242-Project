        "text": "The subscribers to this Subreddit are likely already familiar with Extra Credits, the video game enthusiasts who have since begun teaching history through short, typically six episode YouTube clips. [Last month their series began to cover the topic of Ottoman ruler Süleyman the Magnificent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGZSkLq3Eng)\n\nAs a young Ottomanist-in-training I thought I'd offer my advice, expertise, and sources. I tried to contact them via email. Naturally, anyone teaching a topic with which they are unfamiliar should jump at the chance to take advice from the more experienced. They never responded. Now the series is complete, with disastrous results. To give you a sense of what I mean, here are some comments from the final video in their series:\n\n1. \"sigh, hate to say it but this guy...was not interesting. Like, that was the biggest thing that kept nagging at me, you guys are giving him a lot of fluff to cover up the fact there is not a lot there in his story. Just a tale of a man who succumbed to his emotions instead of his resolve for conquest.\"\n\n2. \"Good riddens to bad rubbish. An oath breaker, a mutilator of prisoners, a cruel reign over the mistreated Hungarians (who would eventually shake off the Ottoman yoke), a man who killed his own sons rather than see them reign in his place, a man who killed his own dear friend based on imagined slights.\"\n\n3. \"...What exactly spurred you all to choose THIS guy for an Extra Credits History series? He was a mismanaging, barbaric A-hole desperate for conquest for no other reason other than for his own glory\"\n\nSo, clearly, something went wrong with their presentation when a decent chunk of their viewing audience of 150,000 people came away thinking of Süleyman as little more than a short-tempered conqueror. How did this happen?\n\nIn short, they chose to focus their show, ostensibly on his entire life and rule, solely on his military conquests and on dynastic intrigue. They said over and over that he desired to conquer the world, portraying the Ottoman Empire not as one state competing among many others on the imperial stage, but as one uniquely devoted to conquest. At every turn Süleyman's motive for invading Europe is explained not as an attempt to accomplish a specific geopolitical objective, but as part of a larger plan to invade and conquer the entire European continent. Those familiar with Ottoman history are certainly familiar with this trope of pitting the Ottoman Empire against Europe in a sort of Early-Modern 'Clash of Civilizations.' Yet this is an idea which professional historians have been attempting to overturn for quite some time. Rifa'at 'Ali Abou-El-Haj in 1991 called for the \"normalization\" of Ottoman history in his book *Formation of the Modern State: The Ottoman Empire, Sixteenth to Eighteenth Centuries* (Syracuse University Press, 1991), and since then many historians have striven to demonstrate that the interplay between the Ottoman Empire and Christian Europe involved more than warfare and hostility (for instance, Suraiya Faroqhi, *The Ottoman Empire and the World Around It* (2007). Depiction of the Ottoman Empire simply as a conquest state, or as \"a near-perfect military society,\" as it was once referred to by Peter Sugar, is now generally regarded as Eurocentric, for the Ottomans' real motives were pushed aside in favor of viewing them as obsessed with European conquests; and as Orientalistic, insofar as it pit Europe against the inscrutable \"other\" in the form of the Muslim world. Extra History fell into this trap, in some ways moreso even than the pre-revision historians.\n\nIn discussing Süleyman's dynastic struggles, Extra History's error is much simpler to explain. Historically Süleyman ordered the execution first of his childhood friend Ibrahim Pasha, and later of his son Mustafa. The reasons for this were manifold and were linked closely with contemporary political circumstances; they need not be explained here. Yet when describing these events Extra History did not feel the need to provide Süleyman with any coherent motivation whatsoever. Süleyman's actions were presented not as logical decisions, but as snap judgements, the result of paranoia over imagined threats.\n\nThese two distortions merge together to create an image of Süleyman and of the Ottoman Empire which is far from accurate: that of a paranoid madman ruling over a conquering and bloodthirsty empire, with little of anything positive to redeem him. The aforementioned commenters weren't writing that way out of bias, for this was the actual image presented by the show, intentional or not.\n\nWith the series having thus come to a conclusion, I contacted them in the only way possible: [by donating to their Patreon and posting a commentary where they would most certainly see it and respond.](https://www.patreon.com/posts/suleiman-vi-of-5151962) This time they did give me a response. They were level-headed, and said they agreed with many of my points and were planning to discuss them in their upcoming \"Lies\" video this weekend, wherein they describe their mistakes at the end of each series they produce.\n\n&gt;From a structural standpoint, we did not give this series (and Suleiman's long reign) enough room to grow. We wanted to avoid more mega-series like Justinian, but we learned that for stories as complicated as Suleiman's, six episodes just isn't going to cut it. I would agree with your statement that in general the first few episodes (where we gave ourselves enough room for detail) presented a better picture. I would disagree with your statement that we did not research such things as Suleiman's law reforms and artistic patronage. I know very well that we wanted to include them, but we hamstrung ourselves with a six episode cap... But when you create in public, you also fail in public. We tried a lot of new things for this series, and took a lot of new lessons to heart. We made mistakes, but we will try to do better. The responsibility you described is one we take very seriously.\n\nIn other words, \"We know what we're talking about, and we did good research, we just didn't give ourselves enough space.\" Well, alright. I think the fundamental problem with the series is its distorted perspective and not the fact that it was too condensed *per se,* but I certainly understand that it's difficult to fairly cover a complex topic in a short time frame. However, if what they said is true, then surely they would be willing to share their sources. Yet when I requested a bibliography (which, I think, is a completely reasonable thing to ask for) they responded with:\n\n&gt;The depiction in the series is a result of our choices and is our responsibility, not the fault of our sources. Source lists are not something I provide generally, and I'd rather be the series be evaluated on its face as a product of our team's efforts.\n\nThey don't want to provide sources. That implies that they're hiding something - that they didn’t really research their topic in the way they claimed. So I dug a bit deeper, and I’m almost positive that their series is based primarily on the book *Suleiman the Magnificent* by André Clot, first published in French 1989 and later translated.\n\nThe probability of them having relied on André Clot’s work is very high. Clot exhibits many of the same distortions that are found in the series, such as the idea that Suleiman was intent on conquering the world, and a disproportionate emphasis on his campaigns against Europe. Clot’s description of certain events are matched blow-for-blow, sometimes almost word-for-word, by the show. As an example, I quote from their description of the Siege of Rhodes:\n\nExtra History: Suleiman, Episode 2, from 6:26 onward:\n\n&gt;He would offer these Christians a truce… He sent them word of his munificence, with the warning that if they turned it down, not even the cats of the island would be spared. The Knights responded by sending him a messenger carrying a letter from Bayezid II, his grandfather, promising them that they could keep the island. He responded by having the letter torn to shreds, and sending back with the envoys two Christian prisoners with their ears and noses cut off so they could see what would happen to all of them… He met with the ancient Grand Master. He felt sorrow for this man who had fought so bravely to be removed in such a manner from his home. He told him that ‘such was the fate of princes.’\n\n[And from Andre Clot, *Suleiman the Magnificent.*](https://books.google.com/books?id=zz0hBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22even%20the%20cats%22&amp;f=false)\n\n&gt;Suleiman offered to negotiate with the Grand Master: if the town was made over to him in three days, the garrison could go free; if they refused, ‘not even the cats’ would be spared… he [the Grand Master] sent two Knights into the Turkish camp bearing a letter written by Suleiman’s grandfather, Bayezid II, to the Grand Master, assuring him that the Order would keep Rhodes. Serasker Ahmed Pasha replied only by tearing the letter to shreds and sending them back with two Christian prisoners whose noses and ears he had cut off… At last Villiers de l’Isle Adam was introduced. The two men remained looking at each other in silence for a long time. Suleiman spoke first, ‘consoled the grand master by saying it was the fate of princes to lose towns and provinces.’\n\nWhile not impossible, it seems unlikely for there to be another source which reproduces both of these quotes with such similar wording (‘not even the cats,’ and ‘the fate of princes’), and searching those quotes on Google and Google Books only brought me back to their YouTube series, and Clot’s book. Considering these and many other similarities, I think it’s a fair bet that they relied heavily on Clot while making this series.\n\nAndré Clot, like many other people who write popular books on the Ottomans, was not a professional historian. He didn’t earn a PhD or have a position in a university. Clot also did not speak Turkish. He wrote his book based on European sources. No matter the topic, it is damning for a historian to be unable to read the language of the country they’re researching, for obvious reasons. Clot originally published his book in 1989. That means that his book is almost thirty years old, which is quite outdated for a work like this (namely, on non-Western history, in which old tropes are rapidly being overturned).\n\nTo quote from a review of Clot’s work by the Ottomanist historian Christine Woodhead (British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 21 (1994): 256-257):\n\n&gt;Although the author is aware that there may be more to Süleyman’s era than meets his eye, in the end what he produces is yet another description – intentionally ‘broad-brush’ – of the Ottoman empire from the outside, a portrayal of Süleyman’s power and grandeur as seen largely through sixteenth-century Western eyes… Indicative is his use of the romantic ‘Roxelane’ for Hürrem Sultan, a heavy concentration on Süleyman’s wars in the west… The text is provided with minimal notes, littered with unsourced statistics and quotations… and a relatively large bibliography of Western-language material, few items of which are referred to in the notes... It would be a pity if this were to become ‘the new book on Süleyman’ for non-Ottomanist historians and their students.\n\nIt seems as though Christine Woodhead’s fear has become a reality, and Extra Credits has “educated” over 150,000 people on Süleyman the Magnificent using an unprofessional source which could have been discredited by any one of the criteria I listed above. They want to hide the fact that they didn’t do proper research, and are thus no longer responding to my comments on their Patreon page. Yet as they themselves said,\n\n&gt; But when you create in public, you also fail in public.\n\nIndeed, you do fail in public. And that means making your sources clear, not hiding them from criticism. If they really did “take a lot of new lessons to heart” then they wouldn’t be shying away from making every step of their research process public. They may not want to lose credibility, but with an audience of 150,000 people, hiding behind the excuse of “lack of room to grow” and refusing to reveal their sources should not be an option. They are creating in public, let them fail there too.\n\nUPDATE: They have since responded, and confirmed that André Clot's book was indeed one of their sources.\n\nUPDATE 2: They have released their \"Lies\" video, and it hardly addresses the aforementioned issues.\n\nUPDATE 3: [Extra History's head writer offers his response.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4gbquh/extra_history_s%C3%BCleyman_episode_ii_the_arrogance/)",

        "text": "[This article](http://nobility.org/2014/12/18/isabella-the-catholic-brings-change-to-chess/) tries to explain how the queen became the most powerful piece on the chess board:\n\n&gt; As the news of Baza’s fall was carried everywhere, the Crusaders’ enthusiasm at Isabella’s arrival at their camp reverberated throughout Spain, and among the manifestations of joy, the rules of chess were changed, with the Queen becoming a most powerful piece, sweeping and majestic in her moves.\n\nIt is certainly true that the queen gained sweeping new powers around the latter half of the fifteenth century.  It is even true that at least one historian has argued that this was a response to the increasing prominence of medieval queens (among other things).^1  As far as I can tell, however, she didn't ascribe this to any particular queen, let alone any particular event.  \n\nThe (very good) reason for this is that no one even agrees, as far as I can tell, on when \"mad queen\" chess was first developed; it was certainly by 1497, when the rule was first unambiguously described by Lucena (his work was the first unambiguous description of the modern rules for bishop and pawn movement, too). It isn't even agreed *where* the change took place.  Murray's *A History of Chess* suggests Italy, Yalom says Spain.\n\nThere also exists much earlier evidence for chess rules with more powerful queens. As early as the twelfth century, there exists literature which suggests that the queen was one of the more powerful pieces on the board.^2  By the early thirteenth century, the *Miracles de la Saint Vierge*, which includes the line \"other ferses [queens] move but one square, this one moves quickly and sharply\", and \"this fers [queen] mates him in straight lines\".  \n\n(And it's also not agreed that the change of rules happened in a single move, from queens being able to move a single square diagonally to the modern ruleset.)  \n\nAs far as I can tell, no one has seriously suggested that the rules were changed in reaction to the siege of Baza. Inevitably, it's a lot more complicated than that.\n\n1\\. Marilyn Yalom, 2004, *Birth of the Chess Queen*\n\n2\\.

        "text": "Whatever you might have answered, the simply named video [“World War 2 Explained,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYsOMpBoPYY) is here to prove you wrong. Proof, such that it can be called that, comes in the form of a narration by William Pierce in which he inveighs against the unfair treatment of the peace loving Germans by hypocritical, Jewish controlled Western democracies.\n\nThis is no exaggeration, and gives an immediate impression of the overall content of the video. As with any criticism of historical argument, it’s important to consider the position of the author, and their motive or interest in creating whatever work they have produced. For William Pierce, the exercise is an easy one. He was a noted neo-Nazi and the author of the masturbatory race-war fantasy “The Turner Diaries.” As such, his narration [portrays German aggression during the Second World War as the desperate defense of an imperiled national culture.](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=66) \n\nIn terms of form, this video is competently edited, and the montage of images intersperses [cut-outs of significant historical figures](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=42) and [actual events](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=56) with [racist stereotypes](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=60) and [anti-Semitic propaganda.](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=309)\n\n Sound is used as a signal of ill-intent or nefarious dealings. The accompanying soundtrack takes a [decidedly sinister turn when Judaism arises as a topic of discussion.](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=291) On the other hand, an [ideal image of German beauty stands in as a representative of the entire nation and their supposed desire for peace.](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=34) \n\nThe videos ‘thesis,’ for lack of a better word, is that because Germany had dared to stand up to Welt Jüdischer Bolschewismus (thereby imperiling the coercive world-order of secret Jewish conspiracy) they were unfairly attacked in order to protect the same. \n\nThe pain begins immediately. \n\n**“Do you remember what started the Second World War? Initially it was just a territorial dispute between Germany and Poland.”**\n\nYes, in the same way that the French Revolution was a minor tiff regarding the proper relationship between human heads and their bodies.\n\nThe closest proximate cause of the Second World War is Adolf Hitler’s unending territorial ambition. His vision for the world excluded the possibility of peace between nations. He believed that struggle against Germany’s neighbors was necessary for the realization of a new German nation, in which the purity of the German soul would be assured by the purity of German soil and the purity of German blood. In Mein Kampf he predicted a near future in which Germans would need to “find the courage to gather our people, and their strength, for an advance along the road that will lead this people from its present, restricted living-space to new land and soil; and hence also free it from the danger of vanishing from the earth or of serving others as a slave nation.”^1  Enfolded in the concept of Lebensraum, the realization of Nazi goals required the extermination of all those who were deemed inferior. In January of 1939, he declared to the Reichstag that “Europe cannot find peace until the Jewish question has been solved.”^2  He predicted war, careful to frame it as the natural consequence of a supposed “Bolshevizing of the earth,”^3 knowing full well that he intended to fulfill his own prediction.  \n\nTherefore, when Britain and France responded to German aggression by declaring war themselves, their decision was not made on a whim. It was a considered and, at that point, unavoidable response to a long series of German escalations and broken promises. Beginning with the reoccupation of the de-militarized Rhineland, the Nazi government had shown themselves to be faithless actors in regard to their international obligations. As Doris Bergen notes, during the period of time soon after his ascension to power, “Hitler’s approach to foreign policy was to talk peace and plan for war.”^4  The invasion of Poland, which itself contravened a mutual non-aggression pact signed in 1934, was but the last of a long series of broken German promises regarding the territorial integrity of other nations.\n\nWithout commenting on the overall justice of the Treaty of Versailles, Article 80 in Section IV of Part III specifically prohibited a political union between Austria and Germany. Presented with the fait accompli of the Anschluss on 12 March, 1938, the deference that Britain and France showed to Germany despite Germany’s violation of a legally binding treaty (this even after the occupation of the Rhineland and the reconstruction of Germany’s armed forces), can only be taken as a sign of their willingness to compromise in order to avoid war. In his address before the House of Commons, Neville Chamberlain laid bare this sentiment when he said that “the hard fact is … that nothing could have arrested this action by Germany unless we and others with us had been prepared to use force to prevent it.”^5  His forbearance was the product of a willingness on the part of the French and British to make certain concessions to Germany for the sake of avoiding war.\n\nThe greatest of these concessions is of course the now infamous Munich agreement, which effectively ceded Czech sovereignty to Nazi ambition. In defending the policy, Neville Chamberlain again evoked the specter of war, saying that “If we have to fight it must be on larger issues than that. I am myself a man of peace to the depths of my soul. Armed conflict between nations is a nightmare to me; but if I were convinced that any nation had made up its mind to dominate the world by fear of its force, I should feel that it must be resisted”  This is an opinion which he reiterated some months later in order to defend himself from criticism of the agreement. Speaking in March 1939, Chamberlain said that he went to Germany “first and foremost because, in what appeared to be an almost desperate situation, that seemed to me to offer the only chance of averting a European war.”^6  Naïve though it may have been, at the time Chamberlain felt he had no choice but to take seriously Adolf Hitler’s declaration that “when this problem is solved Germany has no more territorial problems in Europe.”^7  When Hitler again broke his word and conjured designs for Polish land, the question which faced Britain and France was not whether or not the Danzig corridor was rightly Polish. The question was not whether or not the Treaty of Versailles had been fairly concluded. The question was never one of some niggling territorial dispute as it is characterized by the film. The question which confronted them was whether or not Hitler would ever stop in his mad ambition to rule Europe by force, and already his actions had proven the answer to be a conclusive no. \n\n1.

Ostensibly to protect the freedom of Poland… The Germans had done nothing to Britain and France and wanted very much to remain at peace with those countries, but the politicians of Britain and France had other considerations.”**\n\nThere is exactly nothing which was duplicitous about French and British reactions to German aggression against Poland. Since at least March of 1939, the British government was absolutely clear as regards their intention to protect Polish sovereignty. In response to prompting by Churchill, Chamberlain declared that “in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power.”^1  He then reiterated that the French government stood in lock-step with his own. Some months later, immediately preceding the outbreak of war in Poland, Chamberlain again made Britain’s position clear. Regarding the belief “that intervention by Great Britain on behalf of Poland is no longer a contingency that need be reckoned with,” he said that “no greater mistake could be made.”^2  In the same message he urged a stay of the invective currently being hurled across national lines, and further negotiations in the interest of peace. \n\nThrough Chamberlain Britain was veritably screaming their intentions at Hitler; that they would fight, that they would defend Poland, that they would not accept a peace or political compromise which seriously damaged Polish rights, and so on. Even so, they also remained constantly open to overtures for peace. They fought only to defend Poland, and no ulterior motive need be conjured to explain the reluctant march to war which Britain and France had been propelled along. Hitler’s insatiable belligerence is explanation enough.\n\nHad Germany been truly genuine in its desire for peace, as William Pierce asserts, they need only have accepted the offer of negotiations. Instead, Hitler was so desirous of war that he ordered a staged attack by political prisoners from Dachau against a German radio station.^3 He killed hundreds simply for the opportunity to kill thousands. \n\n1.

[\"Deceiving the Public,\" United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, accessed April 17, 2016.](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007822)\n\n**“The fact that the Soviet Union had also invaded Poland in September 1939 was alright with Britain and France.”**\n\nWhile France and Britain were bound to acknowledge the occupation of Polish territory by the Soviet Union as an evident fact, they were not entirely happy about it, and their reaction can hardly be described as ‘thrilled.’ On the whole, their public reaction was crafted by the recognition that it was currently beyond their power to aid Poland against the Soviet Union. Under the pretense that their aid had not been asked for by Poland, Britain and France deferred action. As reported by the New York Times, the general attitude in London was such that any action against the Soviet Union was characterized as a “quixotic gesture that would be far from helping Poland and would weaken the Allies’ chances of victory and restoration of Polish and Czech-Slovak independence.”^1  In the interim, their policy continued as before: Britain and France sought to prepare their armies, their industries, their populations and their finances for what they expected to be a grueling war of attrition in the West. \n\nDeference to the reality of occupation was not, however, a signal of approval. The leader of the Labor Party, Arthur Greenwood, was quite staunch in his commitment to a war fought with the ultimate aim of securing Polish independence, no matter who might challenge it. He said, “the British working class movement has adopted a definite, unalterable attitude against aggression, wherever and by whosever it is committed. It has accepted the challenge thrown out by Germany. It will not now turn its back on the Polish people, who are the latest victims of aggression, alas on two fronts.”^2 Although they were resigned to the temporary subjugation of Poland by the combined act of Germany and the Soviet Union, The Times of London reported that “public opinion here is revolted, though not the least dismayed, by these cynical exercises in lower diplomacy.”^3  Stalin’s opportunism was looked down upon by the British and French, but at the time they remained focused on their primary enemy: Germany. \n\nNevertheless, the allies would intimate that their patience for Soviet expansionism was not limitless. On the 10th of January 1940 Neville Chamberlain referred to the Soviet Union as “that power with whom Germany made an unholy pact and to whom she set the example of aggression.”^4  In the same speech he praised Finnish resistance against the Soviet Union as being conducted in the same spirit of liberty and justice for which the British fought. Two months later the New York Times reported that Britain was weighing war against Russia should the Finns prove unable to resist them, an assertion which was buoyed by a statement that if it were requested Britain and France would “proceed immediately and jointly to help Finland [with] all the available resources at their disposal.”^5  It may well have been an empty promise given their current preoccupations, but such statements make clear the fact that Soviet adventurism was not going unremarked upon.\n\nBecause neither Britain nor France had the power to oppose the Soviet presence in Poland, they made a cynical choice for themselves to do nothing and say little, so as to better preserve the chance of victory against Hitler. While this is hardly a positive act on their part in defense of Poland, it by no means constituted approval of the Soviet Union’s behavior.\n\n1.

This claim is an explicit articulation of William Pierce’s hateful worldview, and the fact that it is related without irony in the video demonstrates that the video does not in fact intend to be a vehicle of honest historical discussion. \n\nThe Soviet Union was not controlled be Jews. Even if there had been a wide variety of individual Jews in positions of importance, from that fact alone it is impossible to extrapolate some sort of willful, co-religionist conspiracy. That is to say that it is impossible unless you hold a particular irrational hatred of Jews and Judaism, and are willing to lay all the worlds ills at their feet regardless of evidence. \n\n**\"[Germany] was in the process of kicking all of the Jews out of Germany. That was the reason for the Second World War.**\n\nI can only wish that the western democracies would have had the courage to resist Nazism’s racism, political repression, and program of state-sanctioned murder as a cause in and of itself. However, it was strictly Hitler’s final belligerence against Poland which caused France and Britain to declare war against Germany. While defending the oppressed may well have been a noble cause, no one was making the claim that the war against Germany was being fought on behalf of Germany’s Jewish victims.\n\nBesides that, the idea that Germany was kicking all of the Jews out of their own land, and would have been satisfied had they simply been able to accomplish their task in peace is totally false. The vast majority of the victims of the Holocaust were Poles, Ukrainians, Belarussians, and others who had long resided beyond German national borders, and became targets only after Germany deigned to extend its own borders to them. The war was itself a vehicle of the Holocaust, and as Doris Bergen argues in her chapters on the systemization of the Holocaust, the destruction of Jews and other inhabitants of the eastern steppes was a primary Nazi war goal. Germany actively sought more victims, because the virulent ideology which was Nazism could not be satisfied by merely domestic oppression.^1\n\n1. There is a lot of important scholarship to consider here. Further recommended reading includes War and Genocide by Doris Bergen and A World Without Jews by Alan Confino. \n\n[**Genocide Olympics**](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=94)\n\nAt this point the narrative devolves to pure what-about-ism, by bringing up the awful massacre at Katyn and the systematic [“massacre of the elite of the Polish nation”] by the Soviet’s without deigning to mention the systematized program of extermination which Nazi Germany had unleashed upon not only the Polish intelligentsia, but the entire body politic. \n\nThe idea that [\"the controlled media of Britain and the United States ignored the evidence](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=108) of Soviet complicity is totally false. On the whole, they appear simply to not have trusted the \"evidence\" that the Nazis trotted out, and they can hardly be blamed for that. Despite that, The New York Times was active in reporting the massacre, and the possibility of Soviet culpability. Examples of such articles can be found from [April 16, 1943 \"POLES ASK INQUIRY IN SOVIET 'MURDERS'\"](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/04/17/85098157.html?pageNumber=4) and [April 22, 1943 \"RED CROSS DECISION MADE ON 'MASSACRE'\"](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/04/23/85100135.html?pageNumber=3) and [April 23, 1943 \"MASSACRE INQUIRY DEPENDS ON SOVIET\"](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/04/24/85100285.html?pageNumber=4). There are many others besides these examples. The event and the at the time uncertain possibility of Soviet responsibility was hardly ignored.\n\nIt’s wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, and only so much can be said about it. From here on out the video dives directly into conspiracist ramblings about the Warsaw Pact and Communism. This is especially unnerving, because in a seven minute video titled “World War II Explained,” they could only dredge up about two minutes of content that was even somewhat related to the Second World War before they had to fall back on the old standby of blaming personal problems on anything and everything but oneself. \n\n[“leering, swarthy, crooknosed KIKE.”](https://youtu.be/HYsOMpBoPYY?t=405) He mad, and I guess he’s dead now [so fine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwcKwGS7OSQ)\n\nP.S.: An additional shoutout to [this insanity arguing that the Soviet Union didn't invade Poland because it didn't say the magic words \"you're being invaded\" and Poland forgot to ask if it was being detained.](https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/research/mlg09/did_ussr_invade_poland.html)\n\n",

It definitely looks like a pretty cool site, although given that the region of the western Midlands is actually the area of densest villa development in Roman Britain it isn't *quite* as unique as is being portrayed. Anyway, the takeaway is that there is very little in the way of concrete information aside from a sense that this thing is a whopper, which makes it remarkable to me that the Independent managed to pack a grand total of *three* absurdities in its headline, which I will helpfully bold:\n\n&gt;Man accidentally discovers **'perfectly preserved'** Roman villa in his backyard\n\n&gt;Luke Irwin came across the well-preserved Roman villa **dating back 1,400 years** and which **may have been home to an emperor**\n\nIn order:\n\n&gt;Perfectly preserved\n\nIt is freaking knee high walls buried in a field in Western England, even the *mosaic* has a stonking great hole in it. I wouldn't even call Oplontis perfectly preserved and it has part of its roof! The article also calls a child's coffin \"perfectly preserved\" despite the lack of lid and the fact that the sides are really badly chewed. The Independent has very strange standards of perfection.\n\nWhat they mean to say is that it is relatively well preserved, because quite a few of England's villas were outright destroyed due to modern development (one of the most unique villas at Gatcombe was chopped up for a railroad). This is nifty although honestly this claim should wait until more excavation has been conducted to see how many robber trenches there are.\n\n&gt;dating back 1,400 years\n\nIf this villa evidences signs of significant continued occupancy in a form similar to its Late Roman phase into the sixth century I will by a hat and eat it. That would be a find of the century for Roman and Anglo Saxon archaeology. My suspicion is that \"1400 years\" ago is when the last signs of continued occupancy in any capacity end, which could include anything from high status residence to a shepherd's hut. Granted, continued use that late is still pretty cool, and I can't wait to find out more.\n\n&gt;may have been home to an emperor\n\nI can barely even respond to that. If the villa was built between 175 and 220 CE, a very common period for the early development of great villas, the only emperor who visited the island was Septimius Severus, who conducted a military campaign in 208. I rather doubt he built a house.\n\nAnyway, there isn't much to say for the next couple of years, but I will happily recommend Peter Salway's *A History of Roman Britain* for general information.",

        "text": "Do you ever wonder how the Empire of Rome in the west, one of the most remarkable and incredible feats of human management in all history, disintegrated and gave way to the Europe we all know and love? Have you ever wondered just how this unparalleled system of centralized government, this merging of military and bureaucracy fell from glory? And have you then looked in despair at the volume upon volume of works written on it by all those irritating 'scholars' that seem to insist there may not be a clean and easy answer or universal consensus? Have you ever wanted some internet cult leader to just *say it how it is* and give you the easily digestible answer without regard to petty things like 'fact?' Fuck no you haven't, you're far too reasonable and lacking of shrieking ideological mania. \n\n\nBut Stefan 'We were OBJECTIVELY freer' Molyneux is here to salve that burning desire. The desire to watch some smug internet pseudointellectual make a complete fracking fool of himself and get vicariously flayed by your truly, /u/breaksfull P. Esquire, who at the time of stumbling across this thesis by Molyneux had *just* finished Peter Heather's wonderful book *The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians,* and naturally thought a match up between the Oxford professor of Late Antiquity and Early Medieval history and Mad Money Molyneux would be a delightful way to unload some of the accumulated hate and loathing that all souls toiling in Walmarts greasy craw have. \n\n\nVolcanos of all gender orientations! I present! [Stefan Molyneux of Freedomain Radio LIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKGhe5OTiP8)\n\n\nSo we start off with Moly introducing the topic and saying how the fall of Rome is a direct parallel with the current fall of America. Not going to go down that rabbit hole (or other unrelated conspiratorial madness), but I will singe its fluffy tail by shattering his analogy. He'd have you think Rome's troubles began with the decline of Republicanism and the rise of Empire, somehow forgetting that Rome prospered as an Empire so much for centuries than they had to make a second Emperor just to run it all, and that the Eastern Empire (why does everyone always forget them?) prospered for hundreds of years more. Actually the mere existence of the East nullifies his whole argument and I could leave it there, but I haven't tasted enough blood yet.\n\n\nAlso he refers to Rome as a 'welfare state.' Okay free food in the city of Rome itself aside, I wouldn't call the Roman Empire a welfare state given that it has no resemblance to one at all. You'd think he'd be chomping at the bit over how most public buildings were constructed by private individuals for renown and prestige, but nope he just sticks to his anarchistic guns, because what could possibly fell any empire except statism and lack of free trade? What, you don't mean to imply that *foreign invasion* could have anything to do with it? *So what if the East survived another thousand years?!*\n\n\nHe does go in a somewhat new direction around the 1:30 mark, saying that Rome basically lost it's self-confidence and the iron will and brutality to rule an Empire because of centralized government/currency, and the institution of slavery stagnating development. Nevermind that slavery hadn't impeded Roman development during the preceding half millenia, but whatever. He goes on to perpetuate the myth of Hero's Engine saying 'they knew all about the steam engine' and implies they just never bothered to develop it lest the institute of slavery was threatened. [Nevermind that they didn't actually have anything more than a neat little toy and nothing like an actual engine.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1k30h1/could_the_romans_have_build_a_steam_engine_the/)\n\nHonestly I could just refute every one of these points with 'But the East lasted another thousand years' (and prospered for many of them) which is ironic since he actually mentioned that the East lasted and prospered after the western fall at the start of the video. The other all-encompassing rebuttal is that even in the case of the West all the 'problems' he mentions were in place long before the western fall, so this idea of the woes of Empire suddenly piling up and striking after centuries of Western power and wealth rings shallow. For example his claim at 3:40 that the length of military service suddenly spiked to 20 years was something that happened over 500 years earlier as part of the Marian Reforms.\n\n\nAround the videos midway point he blatantly displays his utter lack of knowledge of Roman history at all. He 'argues' that the Roman recruitment system and tax system were dependant on populations centralized in large cities and that collecting taxes and soldiers was impossible with a largely scattered agricultural society, and that the scattering of Romans from urban to rural life helped doom the Empire.\n\n\nNow, [The Roman Empire was quite urbanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_Roman_Empire#Urbanization) for an ancient society. Rome itself had up to a million people at one point, and several other cities (Carthage, Antioch, Constantinople) had populations in the hundreds of thousands. That said, at best only about ten percent of the population lived in cities of some sort and for the most part the Empire was primarily populated by agricultural peasant farmers just like every other pre-modern society, and the Roman bureaucracy was pretty effective at ruthlessly collecting taxes from every scrap of Imperial land. This is pretty damning that Stefan has never read a single book about pre-modern societies and I genuinely question his claim of a Masters in History from the University of Toronto.\n\n\n\nHis completely flawed logical train choo-choo's its way onward. Since the Roman state (which was waaay less centralized than he makes it out to be, limitations of transportation and communication made most of the provinces outside of Italy largely self-governing) lost it's ability to tax and conscript an imaginary urban majority, it turned to hiring barbarian mercenaries which it couldn't pay because of a further devalued currency and a loss of taxable population (grrr you untaxable rural peasantry!) which lead to unpaid barbarian mercenaries sacking Rome. \n\n\nSo it goes without saying that this is completely wrong. While Rome's military evolved with the centuries and put more of a focus on cavalry than on it's infantry-focused predecessor, training and discipline in the Late Roman Army remained vicious and brutal, and the Western Roman Army by the time of the Late Empire was still by far the best fighting force in all of Europe and North Africa. \n\n\nNow he plays into the myth that the army was 'barbarized' and the spots that used to be filled by loyal Roman citizens were now crewed by barbarian recruits of dubious loyalty. In fact the only difference in the Late Empire's policy on recruiting barbarians was that they were now recruited not only as auxiliaries -as Rome had done pretty much forever- but as rank and file soldiers, integrated with citizens into the frontline fighting units of the Roman army. But there are no sources from Late Antiquity that imply these barbarian recruits were anymore disloyal than any other drilled and trained Roman soldiers who were paid on a regular-ish basis. They trained, served, and then retired with a pension or a land plot and went home. \n\n\nNow in the last decades of the Empire, a badly mauled Romany Army did become increasingly dependent on barbarian (mostly Visigothic) military alliances to deal with the ever-increasing threats it faced, and such reliance did weaken the Empires position. However they didn't do this because of untaxable peasants and centralized currency, it was because of Germanic intruders pillaging territory in Gaul, Spain, and worst of all in North Africa, which deprived the Empire of critical income to sustain a powerful field army. \n\n\n[And no Stefan,](https://youtu.be/CKGhe5OTiP8?t=356) Rome's population did not go from a million to seventeen thousand in a 'couple of years' following the sack. Also which sack Stefan? Alaric's sacking of Rome which was remarkably tame for a sacking? Or the more severe sacking in 440 by Genseric? Neither caused a population drop anywhere near what he purports, which didn't occur until nearly a century later after the vicious Gothic Wars between the Byzantines and the Goths.\n\n\nMoving on. Mercifully this is the least amount of Molyneux content I've had to endure in one sitting.\n\n\nActually that's about all he has to say on the Western collapse. He rambles on a bit how Islamic piracy fatally crippled the Byzantine Empire later and caused it's collapse [which is an overexaggeration to say the least](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3a1yua/what_were_the_main_factors_in_the_decline_and/cs8mr6q?context=3) but it wouldn't be a proper Molyneux history lesson without some insert of how *terrible* the Muslims were to everything.\n\n\nSo in essence, Molyneux hasn't the skimpiest idea of what he's talking about. For his prefaces about having a 'masters in history' he doesn't seem to bother doing any research beyond the odd DailyMail article and the comments of his YouTube subscribers/cultists. His ideological dogma makes him obsessed with this idea that all of human history is tied around anarchistic ideas of the free market and decentralized power and he attempts to explain everything through this view model with a sprinkling of racism, and seems aghast at the idea that any silly *historian* could genuinely think an empire could fall from something as superficial as changing power dynamics, internal weakness, or invasion. \n\n\nSources: *The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians* by Peter Heather",

Various sources cited in the relevant [Wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Early_life).\n\nEDIT FOR MORE BACKGROUND:\n\nBoth \"Polish immigrant\" and \"occupied Nazi territory\" are problematic at some level, although the latter is more obviously wrong. First, a ~~brief~~ recap on what \"Poland\" is. When Eliasz Gitman (who would later change his name to Eli Sanders) was born in [Słopnice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82opnice) in 1904, that city and the broader region of [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Eastern_Europe%29) were a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Though some Galicians were ethnic Poles, that designation explicitly excluded Jews. And under the traditional Jewish geography of Eastern Europe, Galicia (גאַליציע, *galitsye*) and Poland (פּױלן, *poyln*) were distinct regions, so Jews in Galicia didn't generally think of themselves as \"Polish\" even in a geographical sense. Eliasz probably grew up thinking of himself as a Galician Jew and an Austrian citizen.\n\nThat changed in 1918, when WWI ended and a [Polish Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic) was declared. This republic spent the next three years or so fighting all its neighbors in a series of border disputes, the last of which ended right around when Eli arrived in New York. (\"Right around\" because the sources I've found don't specify *when* in 1921 he emigrated.) So the citizenship he gave up to become an American was one he had only recently acquired; most of his cohort considered themselves Jewish and Galician more than Polish.\n\nNow for the Nazi thing. Unlike the word \"Polish\", which is awkward but sort-of-technically correct, this is flat-out wrong. In 1921, the Nazi Party was still two years away from the [Beer Hall Putsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch)--the first event to bring them any notice outside of Munich--twelve years away from [starting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_seizure_of_power) to take power in Germany, and eighteen years away from invading and occupying Poland. By the time the occupation started, Eli had not only left Poland but had married a New Yorker, Dorothy Glassberg, and their older son [Larry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanders_(politician%29) was nearly school-age.\n\nFinally, for the record: most of Eli's family members did *not* leave Poland, and were killed. This would have been a totally reasonable point to make instead of what the article actually said.",

Badhistory user quotes a person who is on the Lost Cause choo choo train, they refute their points, no one's opinions changes, but boy, do I feel happier. Take your places everyone! Vamonos!\n\n[Okay here it is in its entirety](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4ekufy/confederate_emblem_antiamerican_judge_in_flag/d21e294)\n\n&gt; I feel this point is relevant. From my remarks in another comment...\n\"Slavery persisted in the north well after the civil war. The only reason slavery became relevant is as a means to destabilize the southern economy. Being primarily agricultural, the south more heavily relied on slavery than the, compatibility skilled production driven northern economy. The civil war wasn't about slavery and there was no good guys. It was about the federal government reinforcing it's dominance. If the south had won your blind patriotism very well may be directed towards the southern regime.\"\n\nLet the break down begin!\n\n&gt; Slavery persisted in the north well after the civil war. \n\nOkay I am defining the \"after Civil War\" as [Surrender at Appomattox, which occurred at MAY 9th, 1865 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House). Sounds easy enough right? Well in an effort to go above and beyond the usual I'll go into some detail. \n\nThis surrender only marked the end of the Eastern Front, but both commanders pretty much knew the gig was up. General Lee had become the embodiment of the Southern Spirit, and his wins and losses directly affected his nation. He was much more influential than the President of the CSA by this point, at least as I can tell. So Lee's surrender was obviously a big deal, but it wasn't a formal surrender by the CSA. Of course, the USA wasn't really keen on accepting an official surrender from the CSA anyhow. The USA government and especially Lincoln were very keen on keeping the Confederacy as an \"armed rebellion\" and not anything else, lease the issue of the legality of secession and the United State's response is ever brought up in court (its complicated). In fact, the overwhelming vast majority of Confederates were not tried for treason because the Government did not want to be proven wrong by law when they were proven right by war. Also the lack of treason accusations may have something to do with the Spanish-American War, and the wish for reconciliation of North and South. \n\nCircling back, Grant allowed such peacefully and respectful sending off of Confederate troops after the Surrender at Appomattox because he wished for Reunion as quickly as possible. He feared that any aggressive stance against these surrendering traitors would spark Guerrilla warfare throughout the South, and ultimately make the victory very short lived and much bloodier. \n\nOkay, still with me? Cool. Now remember how I said I am defining the end of the Civil War as MAY 9th 1865, because it was the fall of Lee? Many historians point out that this was only the end of the Open Conflict by the South, and that the Civil War never really had a defining ending, especially with Reconstruction (Or as I call it, America's Worst Success Story). With the KKK running amok, and discrimination legally in the books, to some, the war continued, but just in another 'theatre'. \n\nOkay, exiting the Fun zone, back to debunking!\n\n&gt; Slavery persisted in the north **well after the civil war.**\n\nThis is dumb because slavery was outlawed *everywhere* in America by the [Muther fuckin 13th Amendment](https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html) which passed congress JANUARY 1865. This was later ratified by the states DECEMBER 1865. Delaware and Kentucky being the only north slave holding states that took their sweet time in ratifying it. Saying that 'Slavery persisted in the north well after the civil war' is a bit deceiving. The amendment to end slavery was already making making the rounds before the Civil War even ended. And if you call 8 months \"well after...\" then that's just rude, especially for 1860s politics. \n\nOnce again, you can't say that \"Slavery persisted in the North well after the civil war\" when the north actively trying to remove it as quickly as possible. It would have even been ratified in July by the north, if they didn't have to wait for their rebellious neighbors to ratify it.\n\nNEXT:\n\n&gt; The only reason slavery became relevant is as a means to destabilize the southern economy. Being primarily agricultural, the south more heavily relied on slavery than the, compatibility skilled production driven northern economy.\n\nOkay thats a bit out of context. YES, the Emancipation Proclamation was a *Military* measure to give northern soldiers the tools necessary to destroy the South, while also allowing the North to replenish it's manpower with the introduction to the USCT. But.... the Southern States seceded because:\n\n- They believed that the territories should have slaves (or at lease half of them should to keep the balance), while Lincoln and the Republican party, and the American voters who voted for them, wished for them to be all slave free.\n\n- They believed that Lincoln was going to destroy their institution, or at least lead to its downfall. This is after Lincoln continuously said that he wouldn't\n\n- They were scared that they lost their stranglehold on politics. Their political bloc (Called Slave Power), was finally beaten after years of making the other political fractions listen to them (Fugitive Slave Act comes to mind)\n\nPlease, everyone interested in the Civil War, go read **Apostles of Disunion**. Not only is it a great book name, it is also a great, slightly infuriating read that shows you how slave focused every Secession convention was.\n\n&gt;  The civil war wasn't about slavery and **there was no good guys**\n\nI'm playing with fire here, but I'll keep going. This is mostly my morals and musings, so skip this part if you want. I'm not your boss.... Anyways... I think there are two ways to find out if there were \"Good Guys\". \n\n\"Good guys\" as in a majority of a 'side' is good, like Ally Countries in WW2. Sure there were definitely bad apples or bad choices. Interment Camps and the such, but they defeated Hitler. Bring this back to the Civil War, I think in our hindsight with a dash of present-ism, we could say that the Union were the 'Good Guys'. They kept the Union together, they were an instrument in stopping slavery for good. They didn't ignore the American Voter because they were upset (seriously no one brings this up enough. Democracy isn't a \"Oh I lost, I'm gonna take all my toys with me\"). Of course, lets not seep into the Treasury of Virtue, and remember that the average Northern was most likely racist or paternal towards African Americans, and that white soldiers were fighting for Union FIRST. The biggest black eye the Confederacy gets on my \"Good Guy Scale\" is that when they captured USCT toops who surrender, they murdered the white northern officers, and put the soldiers back into slavery, not as POWs. I frankly find that disgusting, and is a large bias for me. \n\nOr... \"Good Guys\" as individuals. In this scope I am a bit more accepting that there were \"good guys\" on each side. Men on each side chose to find for many reasons. To prove to society that they were a man, to stick with their community, to earn some money, or because they were drafted. However, on both sides, soldiers knew what their country was fighting for. Reunification or Slavery. I am not saying that every soldier took this in account, but it does give us a very interesting perspective. My thoughts on this matter are constantly changing and evolving when I hear something new, so treat this more as me putting my thoughts down on paper and not as a strict grade.\n\n&gt; It was about the federal government reinforcing it's dominance. \n\nIt was about the federal government recreating the nation that others wished to destroy. The union didn't force most of its troops. It did have a draft (implemented after the Confederate Draft) but that doesn't mean it wasn't about reunion. Not to mention that nearly all the northern states were on board with sending their troops to give the south hell. \n\nEDIT: ALSO... I think this statement puts the blame of the war on the North. #ConfederacyFiredFirst, and never forget that! One chose to make war, one chose to accept it!\n\nI think that's it! Hope you guys learned something new!\n\nEdit: Oh almost forgot! Reading List everyone!\n\n- The previous **Apostles of Disunion**\n\n- **Confederates in the Attic** for a nearly modern view of the lost cause today\n\n- **Becoming Confederates** Shows Lee's many loyalties\n\n- **Lincoln's Greatest Speech** Lincoln's second inaugural address. Shows how smart Lincoln really is. Lincoln knows words. He had the best words.\n\n- **The Memory of the Civil War** shows the battle of Civil War memory. Great pieces on Grant.\n\n- [George K Zhukov's Amazing post, please read it!](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3boun3/the_lost_cause_the_american_civil_war_and_the/)\n",

        "text": "I found the first ridiculous claim that \"religion is the cause of war\" from this publication on Academia.edu:\n\nhttp://www.academia.edu/16479644/Religion_is_the_Cause_of_War\n\nThe author makes the claim that most sources of war originate from religion with the following paragraph:\n\n&gt;Human life and social structuring always derive their momentum from the belief mechanism. With belief, humanity establishes astonishing structures, civilizations as well as self-destruction. Although using belief mechanism is an essential fundamental formation of societies and civilizations, unintelligent use of belief may cause relentless warfare and self-destruction. This type of unintelligent use of belief stagnant belief system puts humanity to high risk of suffering and pain. Therefore, belief mechanism must evolve to acknowledgement and must be used intelligently for the prosperity of humanity. Religion has been using this mechanism for many centuries and causing mass amounts of conflicts between human societies. **Most sources of war originate itself from structured religion and belief system, what we call religion.** \n\nThis is in fact a common claim of atheists and anti-religionists. The atheist blogger Austine Cline on about.com, writing for atheism also agrees with this preposterous claim about religion, writing the following for a list of books he uses to support his argument:\n\n&gt;Religious leaders normally argue that religion is a force for good and love in the world. Yet, at the same time, **we see religion regularly used for war, mass murder, terrorism, and even genocide.**\n\nThe claim that religion is the cause of most wars and suffering in the world is also a Google suggestion for when you type in \"Religion is\" which shows that it is something many people consider to be true.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7hyLway.jpg\n\nIs religion really the main cause of war and most suffering in the world? It's easy to see why atheists and anti-religionists might think that way when you hear of all the Islamic terrorists doing bad things and when you look at history and see the bad that Catholic Church did with the Inquisition, the Witch Hunts and the persecution of Galileo and others the Church deemed to be heretics. However a through examination of history reveals that that most of causes of wars and suffering are in fact secular, even the so-called \"religious wars\" that were The Crusades.\n\nLet's first address the claim that religion causes most wars and look at the actual statistics throughout history to refute this nonsense.\n\nIn the book, The Encyclopaedia of Wars, the historian Alan Axelrod examines wars, revolutions and conflicts since 3,500 BCE. Recorded in the book are a total of 1763 wars and out of these wars, only 123 are classified as having a religious cause. That's less than 7% of all wars since 3,500 BCE so the remaining 1640 wars all had a secular cause.\n\nAt this point, I have seen atheists and anti-religionists claim that the percentage of wars caused by religion don't matter but the death toll does, ending with them claiming that the religious wars have caused more bloodshed and deaths than any other wars. This too is an erroneous claim that ignores the facts.\n\nIn the historical book, \"Parallel Universal History, being an outline of the history and biography of the world. Divided into periods\" Philip Alexander Prince on page 207 estimates The Crusades to have caused around two millions deaths. In comparison, the secular war of WW2 is estimated to have caused around 50 to 80 million deaths. The Crusades pales in comparison.\n\nAnd in truth, The Crusades - whilst having a religious premise - in fact were caused by political reasons and for power. The Seljurk Turks were expanding their empire towards Constantinople, with Emperor Alexios I fearing the advance, he requested aid from the Catholic Church and The Pope, who at the time, had strong influence across Europe. This combined with stories of Christian pilgrims being ill-treated and even butchered by the Muslims in the Middle East gave grounds for The Crusades but in fact the main reason was to stop the advancing Seljurk Turks.\n\nThe historian Giles Constable argues that while some soldiers joined the Crusade for religious reasons, others went for their own reasons including for personal gain.\n\nIn the book \"The Crusades from the Perspective of Byzantium and the Muslim World\" Professor Roy Mottahedeh and the Greek Byzantinist Angeliki Laiou point out the same fact as I, stating that while the contemporaries of The Crusades reasoned that it was a religious war commanded by God, the war was in fact mainly due to the expanding empire of the Seljurk Turks who had already displaced many Christians from the Middle East. They also correctly point out that contemporary historians also recorded this fact:\n\n&gt;This view [crusades being a ideological driven war] is now common in works addressed to the general public, including popular presentations and movies. A leaflet distributed in Clermont during the conference held in 1995 to commemorate the summons to the First Crusade was headed “The Crusades—did\nGod will it?” echoing the crusading cry of “Deus le volt.” It went on to ask\n“Can the Church memorialize the Crusades without asking forgiveness?” and called on\nthe pope to deny that any war can be holy and that sins can be forgiven by killing pagans.\nAccording to this view, the crusaders were inspired by greed and religious fanaticism and\nthe Muslims were the innocent victims of expansionist aggression. Many scholars today,\nhowever, reject this hostile judgement and emphasize the defensive character of the crusades\nas they were seen by contemporaries, who believed that Christianity was endangered\nby enemies who had already overrun much of the traditional Christian world,\nincluding Jerusalem and the Holy Land, and who threatened to take over the remainder.\nAlmost all the historians and chroniclers of the expeditions that were later called the\nFirst Crusade considered them a response to the Muslim threats to Christian holy places\nand peoples in the east. They wrote from different points of view, however, and used varying terminology and biblical passages.\n\nSo yes while the Crusades may have been driven by an ideological cause, the actual cause of the war was in defence of land. These were not wars caused by religions. Pope Urban II's desire to help the Byzantine Empire was also driven mostly by his desire to increase the political authority of The Church and its power. The Catholic Church also used the wars in an attempt to usurp power from the Byzantine Empire and successfully did that in 1204 with the Siege of Constantinople which led to the fall of Byzantine Empire and emergence of the Catholic Church as the sole great power throughout Europe. This fact seems to be forgotten by the anti-religionists and atheists who fail to understand that at this time, The Catholic Church wasn't just a religious organization but a political one too, one that had powers over countries, kings and queens and one that wanted to build a united Church-state with The Pope as the head. This would become known as Christendom.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.historytoday.com/jonathan-phillips/crusades-complete-history\n\nhttp://www.doaks.org/resources/publications/doaks-online-publications/crusades-from-the-perspective-of-byzantium-and-the-muslim-world/cr01.pdf\n\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/crusades\n\nhttp://study.com/academy/lesson/the-crusades-from-start-to-finish.html\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/ks3/history/middle_ages/the_crusades/revision/4/\n\nWhat about the Inquisition then? Well the actual death toll is not the millions anti-religionists exaggerate. The actual statistics are far lower than that. According to Professor Agostino Borromeo, a historian of religions, only 1% of the 125,000 people tried by church were executed. That's approximately 1250 people. This is according to documents from the Vatican archives relating to the trails of the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nThe book, The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe (Second Edition), written by the historian Brian P. Levack states also that only a few thousand were actually executed by the Inquisition and not millions. The archives of the Suprema (documents which record the judgements between 1540 and 1700), contained within the National Historical Archive of Spain, record 1604 executions.\n\nJuan Antonio Llorente, a contemporary historian during the time of the Spanish Inquisition and General Secretary to the Inquisition, estimates that approximately 323,362 people were burned by the Spanish Inquisition from 1479 to 1817. This is of course a much higher count than the couple of thousands estimated by modern historians but still a far cry from the millions that anti-religionists, anti-Catholics and atheists often exaggerate.\n\nLlorente's numbers estimates are in dispute however. Henry Charles Lea, a major historian of the Spanish Inquisition, criticized the estimates of Llorente, putting it down to guess-work and pointing out the discrepancy between the information Llorente produced. He concludes with saying that the numbers of Llorente's are largely exaggerated.\n\n&gt;Before dismissing the impression produced by the severity of the\nInquisition it will not be amiss to attempt some conjecture as to the\ntotality of its operations, especially as regards the burnings, which\nnaturally affected more profoundly the imagination. There is no question\nthat the number of these has been greatly exaggerated in popular belief,\nan exaggeration to which Llorente has largely contributed by his absurd\nmethod of computation, on an arbitrary assumption of a certain annual\naverage for each tribunal in successive periods. It is impossible now to\nreconstruct the statistics of the Inquisition, especially during its\nearly activity, but some general conclusions can be formed from the\ndetails accessible as to a few tribunals.\n\n&gt;The burnings without doubt were numerous during the first few years,\nthrough the unregulated ardor of inquisitors, little versed in the canon\nlaw, who seem to have condemned right and left, on flimsy evidence, and\nwithout allowing their victims the benefit of applying for\nreconciliation, for, while there might be numerous negativos, there\ncertainly were few pertinacious impenitents. The discretion allowed to\nthem to judge as to the genuineness of conversion gave a dangerous\npower, which was doubtless abused by zealots, and the principle that\nimperfect confession was conclusive of impenitence added many to the\nlist of victims, while the wholesale reconciliations under the Edicts of\nGrace afforded an abundant harvest to be garnered under the rule\ncondemning relapse. In the early years, moreover, the absent and the\ndead contributed with their effigies largely to the terrible solemnities\nof the quemadero.\n\n&gt;Modern writers vary irreconcileably in their estimates, influenced more\nlargely by subjective considerations than by the imperfect statistics at\ntheir command. Rodrigo coolly asserts as a positive fact that those who\nperished in Spain at the stake for heresy did not amount to 400 and that\nthese were voluntary victims, who refused to retract their errors.[1145]\nFather Gams reckons 2000 for the period up to the death of Isabella, in\n1504, and as many more from that date up to 1758.[1146] On the other\nhand, Llorente calculates that, up to the end of Torquemada's activity,\nthere had been condemned 105,294 persons, of whom 8800 were burnt\nalive, 6500 in effigy and 90,004 exposed to public penance, while, up to\n1524, the grand totals amounted to 14,344, 9372 and 195,937.[1147] Even\nthese figures are exceeded by Amador de los Rios, who is not usually\ngiven to exaggeration. He assumes that, up to 1525, when the Moriscos\ncommenced to suffer as heretics, the number of those burnt alive\namounted to 28,540, of those burnt in effigy to 16,520 and those\npenanced to 303,847, making a total of 348,907 condemnations for\nJudaism.[1148] Don Melgares Marin, whose familiarity with the documents\nis incontestable, tells us that, in Castile, during 1481, more than\n20,000 were reconciled under Edicts of Grace, more than 3000 were\npenanced with the sanbenito, and more than 4000 were burnt, but he\nadduces no authorities in support of the estimate.[1149]\n\n&gt;The only contemporary who gives us figures for the whole of Spain is\nHernando de Pulgar, secretary of Queen Isabella. His official position\ngave him facilities for obtaining information, and his scarcely veiled\ndislike for the Inquisition was not likely to lead to underrating its\nactivity. He states at 15,000 those who had come in under Edicts of\nGrace, and at 2000 those who were burnt, besides the dead whose bones\nwere exhumed in great quantities; the number of penitents he does not\nestimate. Unluckily, he gives no date but, as his Chronicle ends in\n1490, we may assume that to be the term comprised.[1150] With some\nvariations his figures were adopted by subsequent writers.[1151]\nBernáldez only makes the general statement that throughout Spain an\ninfinite number were burnt and condemned and reconciled and imprisoned,\nand of those reconciled many relapsed and were burnt.[1152]\n\n&gt;The total of Llorente's extravagant guesses, from the foundation of the\nInquisition to 1808, is:\n\n&gt;Burnt in person 31,912 Burnt in effigy 17,659 Heavily penanced 291,450 ------- 341,021\n\n&gt;Hist. crít, IX, 233.\n\n&gt;This is slightly modified by Gallois in his abridgement of Llorente's\nwork (Histoire abregée de la Inquisition d'Espagne, 6^{e} Ed., p.\n351-2, Paris, 1828). He gives the figures:\n\n&gt;Burnt alive 34,658 Burnt in effigy 18,049 Condemned to galleys or\nprison 288,214 ------- 340,921\n\n&gt;It will be observed that Gallois unscrupulously classifies all personal\nrelaxations as burnings alive and all penances as galleys or prison.\n\n&gt;[1148] Hist. de los Judíos de España, III, 492-3.\n\n&gt;[1149] Procedimientos de la Inquisicion, I, 116-17 (Madrid, 1886).\n\n&gt;[1150] Pulgar, Cronica, P.

Relaxed in person 77 238 Relaxed in effigy 74 119 Penanced 811\n1,428\n\n&gt;It will thus be seen how entirely fallacious was the guess-work on\nwhich Llorente based his system.\n\n&gt;An even more conclusive comparison is furnished by the little tribunal\nof the Canaries. After 1524, Llorente includes it among the tribunals\nby which he multiplies the number of yearly victims assigned to each.\nHe thus makes it responsible, from first to last, for 1118 relaxations\nin person and 574 in effigy. Millares (Historia de la Inquisicion en\nlas Islas Canaries, III, 164-8) has printed the official list of the\n_quemados_ during the whole career of the tribunal, and they amount\nin all to eleven burnt in person and a hundred and seven in effigy.\nThe number of the latter is accounted for by the fact that, to render\nits autos interesting, it was often in the habit of prosecuting _in\nabsentia_ Moorish and negro slaves who escaped to Africa after baptism\nand who thus were constructively relapsed.\n\nWhatever the truth, there is no reliable historical source citing the numbers as being millions. \n\nSources:\n\nThe Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe by Brian Levack\n\nLetters from the Inquisition Page 11 and 12\n\nA History of the Inquisition of Spain; vol. 4 by Henry Charles Lea http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44209/44209-8.txt\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/16/artsandhumanities.internationaleducationnews\n\nThe Inquisition and Crusades are often cited as \"wars which caused genocides, resulting in millions of deaths, all which were supported by Christians and The Church\" however when examining the facts as we have above, we find that this is simply untrue. As I have shown above, The Crusades had a secular cause, with religion simply being used as a motivation and excuse. The Inquisition was of course religiously caused but the death toll simply does not amount to the millions commonly claimed by anti-religionists.\n\nWhen we look at history, we find that most wars were secular in nature and that the highest death tolls came from these wars. The Guinness World Records cite WW2 as having the highest death toll from any recorded war in human history with an estimate of 56.4 million killed.\n\n&gt;By far the most costly war in terms of human life was World War II (1939–45), in which the total number of fatalities, including battle deaths and civilians of all countries, is estimated to have been 56.4 million, assuming 26.6 million Soviet fatalities and 7.8 million Chinese civilians were killed. The country that suffered most in proportion to its population was Poland, with 6,028,000 or 17.2 per cent of its population of 35,100,000 killed. \nIn the Paraguayan war of 1864–70 against Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, Paraguay's population was reduced from 407,000 to 221,000 survivors, of whom fewer than 30,000 were adult males.\n\nIn The Great Book of Horrible Things, the author, Matthew White using 377 books and 183 scholarly articles ranks the \"100 Deadliest Episodes in Human History\" with the top 29 with the highest death tolls being the following:\n\n&gt;1. World War II (Worldwide 1939-45)\n&gt;2. Genghis Khan (Asia 1206-27)\n&gt;3. Mao Zedong (China 1949-75)\n&gt;4. British India Famines (1769, 1876, 1896, 1943)\n&gt;5. Fall of the Ming Dynasty (China 1635-62)\n&gt;6. Taiping Rebellion (China 1850-64)\n&gt;7. Stalin (Soviet Union 1928-53)\n&gt;8. Mideast Slave Trade (ca. 700-1900)\n&gt;9. Tamerlane (Central Asia 1370-1405)\n&gt;10. Atlantic Slave Trade (1452-1807)\n&gt;11. First World War (Europe 1914-18)\n&gt;12. Conquest of the Americas (after 1492)\n&gt;13. An Lushan Revolt (China 755-763)\n&gt;14. Xin Dynasty (China 9-24)\n&gt;15. Congo Free State (1886-1908)\n&gt;16. Russian Civil War (1918-22)\n&gt;17. Thirty Years War (Germany 1618-1648)\n&gt;18. Fall of the Yuan Dynasty (China 1358)\n&gt;19. Fall of Rome (Europe 395-455)\n&gt;20. Chinese Civil Wars (1927-37, 1946-49)\n&gt;21. The Mahdi (Sudan 1881-98 )\n&gt;22. Time of Troubles (Russia 1598-1613)\n&gt;23. Aurangzeb (1681-1707)\n&gt;24. Vietnam War (1960-1975)\n&gt;25. Three Kingdoms (China: 189-280)\n&gt;26. Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815)\n&gt;27. Second Congo War (1998-2002)\n&gt;28. Hundred Years War (1337-1453)\n&gt;29. Gladiatorial Games (Rome: 264 BCE-435 CE)\n\nOut of them, only two had a religious cause. Meanwhile, Mao Zedong and Stalin, both communists, have a combined total of causing 60 million deaths by their regimes according to the book. That's 58 million more than the 2 million estimated to have died in the crusades. Interestingly this number has been disputed with other historians claiming Stalin alone killed over 60 million people with Mao Zedong's regime being responsible for a further 45 million deaths. Mao's and Stalin's communist regimes are also notable in that they were anti-religious. Regardless of the correct numbers, it is agreed by all historians that these two regimes were the most bloodiest in human history.\n\nThere have been actual historians who have disputed claims made in Matthew White's book, these disputes however tie into the numbers of deaths caused by these conflicts and war, all agree that the death tolls for the conflicts were all high.\n\nThe information we have from all this suggests that religion is certainly not the major cause of war and is far from being the cause of most suffering in the world. Actual history shows that politics, war over land and totalitarian regimes have been the cause of the most suffering and deaths in the world.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2014, they have been over 11,000 murders in England and Wales combined. The majority of these murders were for personal reasons. Personal conflicts have also been cited as the biggest cause for murders in America. In 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took an in-depth look at homicides in America and concluding from the information the following:\n\n&gt;For homicides and suicides, relationship problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental-health problems, and recent crises were among the primary precipitating factors.\" \n\nAccording to the same organization, 50,000 people die annually in the U.S with the majority (60%) being due to suicide and the second majority being homicides and legal intervention (24%). The organization states that the statistics show that the majority of homicides were preceded by arguments, interpersonal conflicts or were in conjunction with another crime.\n\n&gt;For 2009, a total of 15,981 fatal incidents involving 16,418 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 16 states included in this report. The majority (60.6%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides and deaths involving legal intervention (i.e., deaths caused by police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions) (24.7%), deaths of undetermined intent (14.2%), and unintentional firearm deaths (0.5%). Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and persons aged 45–54 years. Suicides occurred most often in a house or apartment and involved the use of firearms. Suicides were preceded primarily by mental health, intimate partner, or physical health problems or by a crisis during the previous 2 weeks. Homicides occurred at higher rates among males and persons aged 20–24 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. The majority of homicides involved the use of a firearm and occurred in a house or apartment or on a street/highway. Homicides were preceded primarily by arguments and interpersonal conflicts or in conjunction with another crime. Characteristics associated with other manners of death, circumstances preceding death, and special populations also are highlighted in this report.\n\nNow while some out-of-touch with reality atheist or anti-religionist might come now and say \"all those committing suicide are bullied victims of Christian persecution in America!!!\" the statistics show that the majority of those committing suicide do so because of mental illness. The organization reports the following of suicide:\n\n&gt;Precipitating circumstances were known for approximately 90% of suicide decedents. Overall, mental health problems were the most commonly noted circumstance for suicide decedents, with 41.0% described as experiencing a depressed mood at the time of their deaths. Approximately 44.1% were described as having a diagnosed mental health problem; 31.3% were receiving treatment (Table 7). Of those with a diagnosed mental disorder, 74.1% had received a diagnosis of depression/dysthymia, 14.6% bipolar disorder, and 10.6% anxiety disorder (Table 8).\n\nIn comparison to these secular murders and suicides, religious honour killings are estimated to be just over 5,000 a year world-wide. This is according to data from Honour Based Violence Awareness Network, an activist organization which exists to record the violence, raise awareness to it and help victims.\n\nThe FBI in 2012 released statistics for the U.S where there are 1,340 victims of an anti-religious hate crime. 62.4 percent were victims of an offender’s anti-Jewish bias. 11.6 percent were victims of an anti-Islamic bias. 6.4 percent were victims of an anti-Catholic bias. The lowest victims were atheists at 0.9 percent. The targeting of the Jews and Muslims is also unlikely to do with their religion and more with racism if we go by recent attitudes towards Jews and Muslims.\n\nSo while statistics do show there are bad things done in the name of religion such as the honour killings, the statistics for these crimes are very low. Religious extremism and terrorism in this century has been responsible for thousands of deaths too but still, compared to secular conflicts and wars, the death toll of these things is very low. There are more killings done for non-religious reasons. In 14 years alone in the UK and Wales, the number of murder victims surpassed those of the Inquisition, which existed for centuries.\n\nThis is of course not mentioning the thousands of rapes committed annually globally. Very few connected to religion and the majority being connected to revenge or personal satisfaction.\n\nThen there's the widespread corruption in governments like China, which results in the persecution of many innocent people. The starving and disease in places like Africa is down to nature and the economical situation there not religion.\n\nWhat all these statistics, information and facts tell us is that most suffering and conflict in the world is not down to religion at all.\n\nThe claim that religion is the cause of war throughout history or that religion is the cause of most suffering and conflict in the world and has always been and that we would be better off without it is nonsense. Those who have this view, quite frankly, are being self-deluded by their emotions and as history and these statistics are testament to, getting rid of religion would not bring about some sort of world-wide peaceful utopia and in fact, little would change. As these statistics, information and facts show, religion is not regularly used at all to start wars or conflicts as commonly claimed by many anti-religionists and some atheists.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-death-toll-from-wars \n\nhttp://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob62.html\n\nhttp://www.bookofhorriblethings.com/ax01.html\n\nhttp://www.bookofhorriblethings.com/ax02.html\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-deaths-usa-idUSTRE64C53R20100513\n\nhttp://www.citizensreportuk.org/reports/murders-fatal-violence-uk.html\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_ss/ss_cvol.html\n\nhttp://hbv-awareness.com/statistics-data/\n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2012/topic-pages/victims/victims_final\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/books/the-great-big-book-of-horrible-things-by-matthew-white.html?_r=3&amp;ref=arts&amp;",

Found this through a reddit user that also had naenara.com.kp (.kp is the TLD of North Korea) in their user history. I posted this explanation before in /r/badpolitics, but there's plenty of bad history to go around too.\n\nAnyway, off to the factual inconsistencies, starting off with demographics. \n\n&gt;Cambodia’s population was not halved but more than doubled since 1970, despite alleged multiple genocides. Apparently, the genocidaires were inept, or their achievements have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nThis is at best dishonest and lying at worst. Between 1975 and 1980, the population of Cambodia shrank from 7.3 million to 6.3 million, which were coincidentally the years that the Khmer Rouge was in charge. That's a million dead, or more than 13% of its population. And that's a *very* conservative estimate. The only reason the population doubled, was because of a large baby boom after 1985. [As seen in this pyramid.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Pyramide_Cambodge.PNG/640px-Pyramide_Cambodge.PNG)\n\nThe article goes on - it basically reads like North Korean state propaganda, by the way - and then ends a paragraph with this quote: \n\n&gt;He had one great ambition: to terminate the failing colonial capitalism in Cambodia, return to village tradition, and from there, to build a new country from scratch.\n\nCambodia hadn't been a colony for over 20 years when the KR took over. First part of the French colony of Indochina, along with Laos and Vietnam, it became independent in 1953, as a kingdom. This kingdom was far from capitalist; in fact, its king was overthrown by a pro-US military junta in 1970, to then be reinstated as a figurehead...by the Khmer Rouge. But I digress. \n\nAfter some further reading, I encountered a poor man's definition of the KR's Maoist-ish ideology: \n&gt;His vision was very different from the Soviet one. The Soviets built their industry by bleeding the peasantry; Pol Pot wanted to rebuild the village first, and only afterwards  build industry to meet the villagers’ needs.\n\nI know I'm leaving a lot open on this one, but political theory really isn't my cup of tea. Anyway, the KR was emphatically *not* interested in building industry in *any* way. Their ideology focused on creating a purely agrarian society. \n\nAfter invoking the WW2 Dresden bombings (no, really) and downplaying Pol Pot's extreme xenophobia towards Vietnamese and Chinese minorities (calling it \"being suspicious\"), I stumble upon this quote:\n\n&gt;Pol Pot commanded everybody away from the city and to the rice paddies, to plant rice. This was a harsh, but a necessary step, and in a year Cambodia had plenty of rice, enough to feed all and even to sell some surplus to buy necessary commodities.\n\nThis was the forceful deportation of citizens to the countryside. Couldn't really find anything other than blatant apologia, but thought I'd add it in. \n\nFinally, the author cites Chomsky. \n&gt;Noam Chomsky assessed that the death toll in Cambodia may have been inflated “by a factor of a thousand.”\n\nNoam Chomsky famously studied reports on the situation in Cambodia in 1977, along with Edward Herman. His article about it eventually lead to *Manufacturing Consent*, one of his most famous works. The quote is legit, Chomsky indeed stated that the Cambodian genocide was being \"inflated\", and that there was \"a campaign to reconstruct the history of these years so as to place the role of the United States in a more favorable light\". It's one of his most criticized points, and it was eventually found that 33 of the 50 sources used for the article were either from KR sources or from China. \n\nSince then, however, Chomsky has denounced it:\n&gt;[\"I mean the great act of genocide in the modern period is Pol Pot, 1975 through 1978 - that atrocity - I think it would be hard to find any example of a comparable outrage and outpouring of fury.\"](http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm#fn1)\n\nI think you got the point by now. Blatant apologia and propaganda for a regime that's probably the least deserving of it since WW2. And that's saying something.",

Franklin Delano Roosevelt did the same thing during World War II. He declined Jewish refugees from Nazi occupied Europe coming into the U.S. in fear that they could be Nazi spies.... \n\nRead more in post.\n\nIn 1939, Jewish passengers aboard the SS St. Louis were trying to flee from Kristallnacht Germany. They landed in Cuba, the US, Canada. While trying to gain entry into Miami, FDR never responded to their telegram request for asylum. Why? Well there are two main reasons:\n\n1. Quotas established in the US Immigration and Nationality Act of 1924 strictly limited the number of immigrants who could be admitted to the United States each year. In 1939, the annual combined German-Austrian immigration quota was 27,370 and was quickly filled. In fact, there was a waiting list of at least several years. US officials could only have granted visas to the St. Louis passengers by denying them to the thousands of German Jews placed further up on the waiting list. Public opinion in the United States, although ostensibly sympathetic to the plight of refugees and critical of Hitler's policies, continued to favor immigration restrictions. . (Holocaust Museum https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267)\n\n2. Roosevelt was fighting for a 3rd term in office against an isolationist Republican government which did not want to get involved in WWII and the expenses which came with it. It would have signaled to Germany that we were taking sides, when we weren't. Furthermore,the Great Depression had left millions of people in the United States unemployed and fearful of competition for the scarce few jobs available. (Also Holocaust Museum)\n\nSo then he goes on to explain: \n\n&gt;There was a possibility that they could have been Nazi spies. If FDR allowed them, the Nazis would have sent their own as \"Jews\" and infiltrated the U.S. Who knows what could of happened if he allowed them. They could have causes havoc within the U.S., or even worse they could have stolen the Manhattan Project. You can only do so much to help people until it puts other people in danger.\n\nWhat is wrong with this statement? Well a few things. Aside from why FDR refused to let them in, which I just explained.\n\n1. The most important being that the Manhattan Project was started in 1942. 3 years later. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project)\n \n2. The Manhattan Project was overseen by a German Jew (Oppenheimer). Guess those darn Jews going in on quotas could have been spies as well, right? **Edit: As was pointed out, he was only half Jewish and not religious. Plus he was born in the US**\n\n3. It was incredibly difficult to even get in on the Manhattan Project and was extremely secretive. To the point that most people working on it had no idea what they were doing. \n \n\nI'm no historian, so please correct anything if I am wrong. Thanks!\n\n**Edit** Just to add, nearly a quarter of those on board were killed. How anyone could say that was a good thing....\n\n**Edit 2**: If anyone else would like to read more about the modern politics I cannot mention and the SS St. Louis here is an interesting article from /u/PutinsHockeyCoach http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/161922\n",

        "title": "\"What if the Allies had lost WWI\"--more like, \"What If America had lost WWI\"",
        "author": "PaperbackWriter66",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4dq75n/what_if_the_allies_had_lost_wwimore_like_what_if/",
        "text": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/world-war-i-legacy-democracy/394616/?utm_source=SFFB\n\nTypical of something from The Atlantic; overly long, tendentious, and whatever point it has gets lost in the article's incessant self-admiration. So many things wrong with this, I don't know where to start, but....\n\nWhen, finally, we get past the stupid and seemingly pointless diatribes about \"merchants of death\" and arms manufacturers and conspiracies to involve the US in foreign wars and we get to the meat of the article: what would have happened if the Allies lost WWI? And immediately we run into trouble.\n\n&gt;By the summer of 1917, the Western Allies had exhausted their credit in U.S. financial markets. Without direct U.S. government-to-government aid, they could not have afforded any more offensives in the West.\n\nWell, even if that's true, that doesn't mean the Allies would have lost. It certainly doesn't mean the US had to send soldiers to fight in the trenches. Why not merely provide financial assistance? Even if for reasons of economy the Allies launched no offensives (and I doubt that would have seriously restricted their offensive efforts; manpower was always a more severe problem than materiel after 1915), then they simply would have waited. They may not have launched any further offensives in 1918, but they would have in 1919, and if not 1919, 1920. But they wouldn't have to wait for 1920, because Germany would have collapsed of exhaustion well before then.\n\nThe author makes it sound as if Germany's economy was fundamentally stronger than the Allies....but it wasn't. Sure, it was larger than either Britain or France, but it was a lot less efficient and it was starved of many essential resources due to the naval blockade (maintained, not by the United States but by the British Royal Navy). In short, the Allies would have waited, because they could out-wait the Germans. The German war economy was substantially weaker than the Allied war economy, and by 1918 hunger was a serious problem in Germany. Even absent battlefield success (or even activity), the Allies would have no reason to go to the negotiating table in 1918 nor any reason to suspend the war when they were more capable of sustaining it than were the Germans. But 1918 was not a year of inactivity, it was actually a year of tremendous battlefield success on the part of the Allies\n\n&gt;Minus U.S. reinforcements on land and sea, it’s difficult to imagine how the Allies could have defeated a Germany that had knocked revolutionary Russia out of the war.\n\nUm....pretty much how they did defeat Germany. First of all, yes, Germany knocked Russia out of the war in 1917, but that's not so much an indication of how strong Germany was, it's more a statement of how weak Russia was by 1917.\n\nSecondly, I'm not going to deny that American soldiers helped defeat Germany, but Americans were not the decisive factor. Germany collapsed from within largely due to inherent weaknesses in the German war economy and due to the collapse of her allies, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires (and the Americans fought neither). Moreover, Germany herself was defeated decisively on the battlefield and Americans played a tiny role in this.\n\nThe 100 Days Offensive in the summer/autumn of 1918 was a stunning British victory in which British generals masterfully used combined arms in a proto-blitzkrieg and British/Empire soldiers defeated their German foes on the battlefield; by the end of it, the German Army was in the beginning stages of collapse and would not be able to hold the field at all much longer. Moreover, the German economy was already straining by 1917, and by 1918 was, like the German army, on the verge of collapse, something which the Americans had virtually no influence on. Americans played only a very small part in this battlefield victory, though certainly Americans did contribute and they made a substantial contribution in the Spring Offensive earlier in the year, but it was the British Army and the Germans' own internal collapse that were most decisive in defeating Germany in 1918. So the idea that without direct American involvement on the battlefield in 1918 would have resulted in a defeat for the Allies is just nonsense.\n\nThis is important because the rest of the article rests on the assumption that Allied victory in WWI was American-centric and America would have a large and important role to play in any peace conference, whether the Allies were victorious or defeated. This is ignoring actual history, where the French and British were clearly the dominant players in the post-war peace conference and America (or, rather, President Wilson) largely failed to have a fraction of the effect he wanted at Versailles. Put shortly, the United States at Versailles in 1919 was not the United States at Potsdam or Yalta, as the author seems to believe. But instead the author ignores actual history and instead presents us a bizarre alternate timeline in which the Kaiser's Germany was akin to the Soviet Union in 1946.\n\n&gt;Even if the Germans had traded concessions in the West to preserve their gains in the East, the kaiser’s Germany would have emerged from such an outcome as the dominant power on the continent of Europe.\n\nUm, no. Given how weakened the Germans were by 1918, even if they had successfully negotiated WWI to an end, there's no way they would have been the dominant power in Europe. Eastern Europe was ablaze with ethnic strife and the fighting in Eastern Europe wouldn't end until the 1920s. For Germany to be the \"dominant power\" in Europe, it would have had to stamp out all the many ethnic factions fighting to carve out territory from the former Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, something which was simply beyond the military capacity of Germany by 1918, even if it had negotiated its war against France/UK/US to an end. A negotiated peace in 1918 probably would have left Germany intact and probably with much of her possessions in East Prussia, but Germany would just barely have been able to stave off revolution and civil war within its own country, so whether it could project its power on any other part of Europe is very much in doubt.\n\n&gt;The United States would have found itself after such a negotiated peace confronting the same outcome as it faced in 1946: a Europe divided between East and West, with the battered West looking to the United States for protection.\n\nWell, no. 1919 was fundamentally different from 1946; leaving aside questions of an ideological struggle between communism and capitalism (and the nuclear dimension to things), in 1946 all of Eastern Europe and a lot of Central Europe was united under the Soviet jackboot. In 1919, pretty much all of Europe south or east of Germany was in tatters and disunited--four empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian) had just collapsed, virtually overnight. Half of Europe was up for grabs. Even in the scenario the author presents where the Germans have \"won\" by negotiation, that would not change the fact that most of Europe is suddenly no longer under an Imperial yoke of some sort. In 1946, it was a very clear \"us\" vs \"them\" situation--free Europe vs. Communist Europe. No such clear dividing line can be found in 1919, which is much closer to \"everyone vs. everyone else\". Hell, even within Germany, Bavaria tried to break away from Germany in 1919.\n\nThe idea that Europe would be divided, most of it under the Kaiser's control/influence, is ridiculous, but only slightly more ridiculous is the idea that the rest of Europe would rally around the United States. Why should they? In 1946, they had to, because the US was the only free industrialized economy still standing, everyone else was a bombed out, burnt out, broken down shell or (in the case of Britain) completely and utterly bankrupt (or both). The same was not true in 1919, when France and Britain were down but not out. And, as reality shows, Wilson got completely outmaneuvered by the French and British at Versailles; there is no reason to believe that would be any different in the alternate timeline posited by the author.\n\n&gt;Had the Western Allies lost the First World War, European democracy would have failed the test that American democracy surmounted in the Civil War: the test of survival in the competition between nations and regimes.\n\nExcept....European democracy did fail even after the Allies won WWI. By the author's own admission, Italy and Japan (both on the Allied side in WWI) went in the complete wrong direction, becoming fascist, totalitarian states after WWI, as did a host of other European countries. Hell, Spain became fascist after WWI, and they weren't even involved in the war!\n\nIt's just a very strange thing to suggest, that the answer to the big \"what if\" of \"What if the Allies lost WWI?\" is \"Europe wouldn't have become democratic\" when a lot of Europe didn't become democratic even after the Allies won WWI. It was WWII and the eventual western triumph in the Cold War that ensured European democracy finally prevailed, not Allied victory or defeat in WWI.\n\nTLDR, this is a pretty terrible article that should have been titled \"What would have happened if America hadn't won WWI\"--and the answer to that question is pretty much \"what did happen\".\n\nThis article is an example of what happens when an American author (with not a terribly good grasp of WWI, it seems) tries to take an America-centric view on a historical event in which the United States was honestly not really all that important. The US wasn't really all that important to the outcome of WWI and didn't have much of an effect on the subsequent peace process, and there is little reason to believe that would be very different had the Allies failed to defeat Germany in 1918. This article is just mental masturbation indulging in the fantasy that the US is sublime at manipulating world events and shaping the world in its image, when history begs to differ.\n",

        "text": "Hello, Badhistorians! This is my first badhistory post ever (as evidenced by my previous failed attempt at posting this with an np link), as I am but an amateur with no formal history education. However, I feel confident enough in the massive, Transatlantic Triangle-sized hole in [this ChangeMyView OP's perception of slavery](https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4diurv/cmv_essentially_every_culture_on_earth/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) that I feel qualified to discuss what little I know. \n\nAs a primer, the topic of the CMV thread was to change the OP's view that \"essentially every culture on earth participated in slavery until white people put a stop to it.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; ... all cultures throughout history practiced slavery in one form or another.\nAll major empires from Chinese to Mongolian to Persian to Arab to Ottoman to British to French had slaves.\nThe Ottoman and Arab empires of the Middle East prior to the 21st century had BY FAR the greatest exploitation of African people, not to mention capturing and enslaving millions of Europeans for centuries.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile not *technically* wrong, I take issue with the lumping of these vastly different cultures and several hundred year spans of time as the same generic institution of \"Slavery.\" The slavery the Romans practiced has very little resemblance or effect on that of the Ottomans (for example, [Roman slaves could earn money and voluntarily buy their freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome). In the Ottoman Empire, [slaves could sometimes hold influential political positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Ottoman_Empire), and constituted one of the most influential factions of the military, the jannisaries. The taking of slaves in war by the Mongols has no relation to the Transatlantic Slave Trade, or to any form of slavery that existed in Africa. To frame the issue in this way implies that subsequent cultures merely inherited the same kind of \"slavery\" from a previous culture, instead of organically developing in distinct ways. It asserts that all of these cultures accepted the same idea of \"Slavery\" as a fact of life.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Yet I get ignorant arguments from American-centric people that somehow white Americans invented Slavery and are perpetually guilty for generations.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTrue, Americans did not \"invent\" the concept of involuntary servitude and labor, and I understand history is not a \"blame game\", but American slavery was not insignificant. It continued to be legal until 1865,  32 years after the British had abolished slavery and 17 years after the French. I'm not sure how this absolves Americans who participated in the institution of slavery of responsibility.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow time for the **real kicker:**\n&gt;Everyone practised slavery at that time, from the Africans themselves through the Middle East and Asians.\nWhite people did it too but it was **white people who ended it and otherwise there would still be global slavery**.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd another gem from the comments:\n&gt;It's not not about celebrating white people for stopping enslaving \"us\", it's about acknowledging the historical fact that everyone was subject to Slavery until the British used their global power to end it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHoooooo boy, I don't know about these. Yes, I suppose he's right, that in America and Britain and France and any other region controlled by a predominantly white nation, I suppose you *could* attribute the abolition of slavery to white people. You know, because *they were the ones who allowed it to occur in their countries in the first place. And because there were no people of color in positions of power who could \"end\" slavery in those countries, due to them being enslaved and/or minorities.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis also completely ignores the [numerous slave revolts and abolition efforts made by enslaved people throughout history](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/slave-route/resistances-and-abolitions/). To say that only white people ended slavery implies that these revolts and efforts played no part in abolition, and that Mighty Whitey simply came in to save the day. Hell, [the entire country of Haiti exists](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/slave-route/resistances-and-abolitions/toussaint-louverture/) because of a successful **Black** slave rebellion which expelled the French. Obviously the Haitians did not abolish *French* slavery, and clearly the benevolent white French were not so keen on ending slavery considering that Napoleon attempted to retake the island and re-institute slavery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA final note: the issue that I think permeates this entire post, is the OP's continual generalization of \"White People\" as some monolithic bloc. And that \"everyone\" was enslaving people left and right, until one day, the Glorious and Noble White Overlords in *every white country* were finally in a position to end it. This is a deeply troubling view of the world; the White Man's Burden to an unprecedented degree.",

Or, [to quote our prime offender:](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4d66mp/what_misinterpretedmisrepresented_historical_fact/d1o7os2)\n\n&gt; Stalin was the Soviet government. If he died and there was no clear successor virtually every part of the Soviet war machine would be thrown in chaos.\n\nThis, and the following doubling down in that thread, is bunk. It betrays an extremely superficial understanding of the Soviet state, one that can be summed up as 'Stalin da boss'. It's entirely based on the one thing that everybody knows about the USSR (ie Stalin was not nice) without being encumbered by any actual knowledge. What do you need to do to win the war? Kill the opposing leader, simples.\n\nThis is not an approach I agree with.\n\nLet's start with Stalin's role in government. He was, to use M Svolik's phrase, an 'established autocrat' with near unlimited power within the Soviet government. That's not in dispute - by 1941 his supposed Politburo peers were in terror of him. But this says very little as to how Stalin *exercised* this power or the quality of those around him. (Being afraid of Stalin didn't make you a gibbering incompetent, it was a rational response to his power.)\n\nUnlike a certain contemporary German dictator, Stalin did not occupy an extra-legal place in the Soviet state. He sat at the apex of a pyramid of committees (both party and state) that had been built up and tempered over the previous two decades. Importantly, this was a structure that existed independently of him: as important a role as he played, the General Secretary could be replaced. In the event of his death the committees, at all levels, would continue to function... even with collegiate leadership, as in the NEP and post-Stalin years*. Collective government was not alien to the USSR.\n\nAnd these committees were comprised of a strong set of administrators. Stalin tended to dive into the details of specific campaigns (whether the front or grain collection) but was otherwise content to delegate to the governing team of technocrats. This 'Team Stalin' were tough administrators who had been hardened and tested during the 1930s (eg Molotov, Kaganovich, Khrushchev, Malenkov). They, and the rest of the party leadership, were loyal not just to Stalin personally but also his programme of industrialisation and, obviously, resisting the invaders. To state the obvious: this group was unlikely to fracture into in-fighting in the middle of a war of extermination.\n\nStalin might have provided the policy direction and subsequent stamp of approval but these were the men who ran the USSR, with relative freedom within their spheres. This was reinforced by the war: the strains of the invasion led Moscow to *relax* its control over much of the civilian sector, delegating significant powers to local party bodies. Stalin had control over general policy but everything did not go through him unless he specifically requested it.\n\nA comparison might help. Remove Hitler and the German government would fragment into its various petty empires; there was no central cabinet-level body and Hitler jealously protected his right to adjudicate on everything. Remove Stalin and there were still very strong institutional bonds, based on both state and party, to bind the Soviet state together. The organs of governance would remain and the leadership was more than capable of banding together to tackle the immediate war issues.\n\n(As for the broader psychological impact, I don't see why Stalin-as-a-martyr is less powerful an image as than Stalin-as-a-provider.)\n\nSo Stalin was not the be-all and end-all of the Soviet state; much of it existed independently of his person. There was no need for a clear successor (given Soviet traditions of collective leadership) and little likelihood of a vicious power struggle breaking out. The party machine could have continued to function, now with policy decisions coming from a reconstituted Politburo. It's very hard to see how \"every part of the Soviet war machine would be thrown in chaos\".\n\nIf the Germans had somehow made it to Moscow without taking Kiev *and* somehow taken the city (like they did Leningrad and Stalingrad, right?) *and* killed Stalin in the process... well, the Soviet state would continue to function. Because there was more to it than one paranoid Georgian.\n\nInstead we get Great Man history in which the war hinges on the actions and survival of [a couple of supermen.](http://johnl.org/2009/08/27/stalin-vs-hitler/)\n\n*And did post-1953 when, startlingly, the Soviet state didn't collapse. Typically, the person who pointed that out in the original thread was downvoted for their trouble.",

Today we'll be discussing how a revolutionary socialist somehow pioneered the very same ideology she was fighting against! Oh my!\n\nCome along and join me as I drink copious amounts of spiced rum and talk about the origins of democratic socialism and the history of the German political scene!\n\nIf this is more badpolitics than badhistory, let me know!\n\n&gt;[Luxemburg will always be relevant when talking about democratic socialism because it's *her* theory](https://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/4d45a8/has_anyone_noticed_that_paradox_has_a_weirdly/d1now5f)\n\nReally, no she isn't. This is ignoring the fact before her the *dreaded* Social Democratic Party of Germany had adopted democratic socialism as their policy after merging the Eisenachers and the Lassalleans into the first SPD party long before she was on the political scene. The theory on its own has gone back even further to Robert Owen's Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers whom would by today's standards be considered democratic socialism with a co-operative context.\n\nFurthermore, Luxemburgism is *not* considered democratic socialism in any context except for dealing with the issues of Marxist-Leninism and its vanguardist methods. At the end of the day, the ideology and in extension the Spartacus League were revolutionary socialists who wanted to violently overthrow the Weimar Republic during the German Revolution and establish a socialist republic.\n\n&gt;[Unfortunately social democrats killed Luxemburg who was the most likely democratic socialist to make any substantial change to a capitalist system](https://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/4d45a8/has_anyone_noticed_that_paradox_has_a_weirdly/d1noo2r)\n\nLuxemburg was killed by a right-wing Freikorps named run by one Waldemar Pabst. And in practice, the SPD were socialists that had gone against the revolutionary currents inspired by the February Revolution. In capacity was the SPD to be blamed for this unless you're equating the Freikorps to the Weimar Republic and the SPD.\n\nThe SPD's Erfut Program was explicitly democratic socialist and reformist, nothing 'social democratic' about it. And in practice, the SPD never explicitly became social democratic until 1991 or in 1959 with the Godesberg Program depending on perspective. In perspective, the SPD were more democratic socialist than Luxemburgism.",

        "text": "Talking about this article:\n\nhttp://www.startupsocieties.com/?p=617\n\nThe authors main contention is that:\n\n&gt;The living standards in ancient Greece were so high that they remained unmatched until the 19th century.\n\nNow I have no idea how he is measuring 'living standards.'  I have a strong feeling that the many slaves in ancient Greece aren't counted.  \n\nGreece and Greek populations were part of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire.  All of which were extremely wealthy and where trade and cultural exchanged flourished. Why isn't the author counting these?\n\nHis answer:\n\n&gt;Nowadays, common knowledge would have one believe that the Greek’s decentralization should have made trade impossible. The opposite seems to have been the case: living standards rose for the ancient Greeks until the Romans centralized and unified the region. Life for the commoners was much better under the city states than it was under the Byzantine empire. \n\nOkay, maybe I can accept that.  But then he goes on to praise Alexander the Great, you know the guy who conquered Greece and put it under a single ruler, ie centralization.    \n\n&gt;Trade played a key role in every aspect of Greek societies. This is reflected by the design of the Polis. Greek city states were organized around the Agora, a marketplace which served as a place of commerce and debate. This contrasts with the more theocratic societies of the Persians, which were built around temples and shrines.\n\nI have several problems with this.  First of all it assumes that trade was unimportant to other societies.  Trade was essential to the Persians who connected trade routes from modern day India to west, and also to the Romans who built vast trade networks that stretched from Norway to China.  Second of all it claims that religion was unimportant to Greeks, which is completely untrue.  Heck their most famous city - Athens - was named after a religious figure.  \n\n\n&gt;Despite the decentralization of the city states, the Greeks were always able to muster large military forces in times of need. They also fought very innovatively. Their unorthodox tactics helped them defeat greater military forces. This can be seen during the battle of Syracuse, where Archimedes used a mirror to sink Roman boats.\n\nRome was highly centralized and ultimately able to beat Greece militarily.  But more importantly Rome was well known for innovative military technology. In the siege that the author is talking about Rome had all kinds of novel siege engines. Heck one of the most genius military inventions of all time - gunpowder - was created in highly centralized China. \n\n&gt;For example Heron of Alexandria built a working steam engine around 10 AD\n\nSo when Alexandria was under Roman control?  How does this prove the authors point?",

        "text": "&gt;\"The original Medieval Warhorse breed is now extinct, but recently horses have been bred from Clydesdales and Quarter horses to reproduce a type similar to the Medieval Warhorse. They are the largest breed of horse, standing from 20 (203cm/6.6 feet) to 24 (243cm/8feet) hands tall, with a thicker build than Clydesdales with less fur.\"\n\n* http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-weapons/warhorse.htm\n\nOne of the big images used to support the concept of a massive medieval warhorse:\n\n* http://c8.alamy.com/comp/EX6J7F/sir-geoffrey-luttrell-armed-and-mounted-from-the-fourteenth-century-EX6J7F.jpg\n\nHowever, the issue is that the average height of women in this time period (14th Century) was around 158cm/5.2ft.  Horses have their height measured at the shouder (withers) in a unit of measurement called hands.  158cm/5.2ft is 15.5 hands, but the woman handing the helmet up appears to be slightly taller than the withers.  So, let's just go with 15.2 hands/154cm/5ft.  \n\nObligatory photo of an Iberian horse (Lusitano) since Spanish horses were praised very heavily and introduced into many breeding programs.  Charlemagne's, specifically and to give an idea as to how long the integration was going on.  I'm going with Lusitanos over Andalusians just because I like them more.  They share a ton of characteristics, though.\n\n* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Grey_lusitano.jpg\n\nI apologize for potato quality on these photos, but this shows the ratio of person (with unknown height) to a 16.3 hand/165/5.4ft horse.  16.3 hands is on the largish size for a riding horse, but weight is more breed dependent. (edited because I put the wrong link and I can't find the old one now)\n\n* https://www.equinehits.com/horses-for-sale/horse-215853\n\nNow, the deviation in human leg length in proportion to horse body is probably more due to the style saddle used.  Modern English saddles are designed to maximize contact with the horse and allow for use of various physical aids like seat and legs.\n\nLooking back on this particular horse's pedigree, the height has been standardized at that 15.2 (155cm) level for at least 60 years on this bloodline.  However, it's pretty standard for Lusitanos to hit 16 hands.  They aren't small horses.  They've also got an immense amount of stamina, which is a size/bulk trade off.\n\n* http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/ungaro7\n\nGetting away from the Spanish horse and moving north we run into the Friesian horse. I'll just leave this picture and this video here:\n\n* http://kingdomofhorses.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ladyhawke-2.jpg\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIl9IFcIXlg\n\nThis is the horse that people think of when they think medieval warhorse, or even larger.  It's a Friesian.\n\nStandard Friesian height is around 15.3 hands, rarely spiking upwards to a max of 17 hands (172cm), only slightly taller than the Lusitano.  Rutger Hauer is 6'1\" (185cm) and not a small guy so I'm going to guess that the Friesian in the movie (named Othello, can't find any pedigree information) is around 16.2 hands/165cm/5.4ft.  This is the same height as the horse linked higher up.  Friesians are significantly bulkier than Lusitanos, but it comes at a cost.  The stamina on these horses is terrible.  \n\nThey're beautiful, can carry weight, just not that far or that long.  They also don't deal well with heat.  It's considered a riding light draft horse.\n\nNow where this fits in with BadHistory is pretty simple.  Friesians are only slightly heavier build than the Lusitano and have a significant stamina issue.  Going larger into the Clydesdale or Percheron (one of the ones often trotted out as being closest to medieval warhorse) you get a huge increase in the amount of energy required to move the mass.  That trade-off happens pretty quickly, too.  Like anything there's optimal power/mass ratios.  Big horses also eat.  A lot.  And require water.  Things in short supply on a campaign.\n\nThe other issue with people citing the massive warhorses?  Barrel width of the horse.  People have to sit on them with saddles and use legs as controls.  Massively tall horses are also massively wide, making leg control difficult.  Since the whole point of the warhorse was to carry a guy who wanted to stick bits of metal into people with his hands, having to use hands as a control sort of makes it difficult.\n\n\nMoving on to specific citations that support this:\n\n* Royal Armouries at Leeds analyzed warhorse armor, found that the size was a stocky 15.2 hands. Theory that 'magnus equus' refers to a horse of superior muscle tone and training, not a 17-18 hand/173cm/5.7ft horse.(Rogers, 272)\n\n* Surviving medieval horseshoes confirm a 15 hand/152cm/5ft animal. (Church, 26)\n\n* \"Some late medieval horse skeletons were of horses over 15 hands.\" (Eglan, 55)\n\n* Big discussion of height proportion in paintings, coming to the conclusion that the height is around 15 hands, even given medieval flexibility with proportions. (Clark, 25)\n\n\n\nBottom line?  Your average medieval warhorse was between 15-16 hands, max, weighing around 550-600kg.  They were not massive Percherons or heavy draft horses.  Stop trying to make this a thing.  A stocky 16 hand horse covered in stuff with a guy trying to stick metal into your delicate internal organs is pretty fucking terrifying.  See Ladyhawke video clip of how the combination of the two just LOOKS big.\n\n\nNotes: I know someone is going to bring up the Norman Cob, but if Spanish horses were good enough for old Charlie boy the Great to send to a Persian king (Rogers, 273), they'll damn well be good enough for here.  Also, the Norman cob is ugly and I like pretty horses.  Lusitano and Friesian are both pretty.  ACCEPT MY BIAS!!!\n\nAlso, yes the Percheron may be descended from medieval warhorses but that does not mean it has a similar height.  Shrink it down and you're getting similar proportions.\n\n/u/Daeres can suck it for saying they were the size of Shire horses.  I've got proof, now.

Imagine my sheer and utter joy when I found [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/49rh9v/greatest_person_of_all_time/d0unq2f) and realised I had the opportunity to write about the lowliest thing of all - crap. Really, it's right up my alley.\n\nThis particular comment claims that the word \"crap\" didn't exist prior to Thomas Crapper's invention of indoor plumbing. While there are so very many things to pick apart in this comment thread - Crapper not being the inventor or populariser of indoor plumbing among them - what I want to talk about is crap. Crap, contrary to this user's claims, did in fact exist prior to Mr. Crapper. \n\nIn fact, \"crap\" has its roots in Latin and Dutch, though to what extent each is the true origin is unclear. Certainly the Latin usage - *crappa*, or chaff - has its influence on English as the first instances of the usage of \"crap\" in English does relate to weeds and other things people didn't want in their crops. Equally, the Dutch usage - *krappen* - also applies, as it means to separate or sift.\n\nUntil the 16th century, various incarnations of \"crap\" were used almost exclusively in an agricultural context. \"Crap's\" first \"modern\" usage was used to refer to the waste product that was generated after rendering fat. Once again, a bit agricultural, but also clearly moving in the direction of what we currently understand crap to be. \n\nHowever, the clearest proof there is that Crapper is not the source of crap is the fact that the 1846 Oxford English Dictionary lists a \"crapping ken\" as a type of privy, implying that \"crapping\" did, to some extent, mean pooing. Indeed, even before this, there is reference to \"crap\" having the meaning we currently attribute to it in a poem from 1801. Given that Crapper wasn't making his...well...crappers until 1861, it seems unlikely that he is either the source of populariser of the word.\n\nNow that said, it is interesting that most of what I've cited here is British, and indeed, the word was not as popular in American English until the 1920s. A common story about why this is cites the fact that Thomas Crapper had a habit of branding his invention, and American servicemen enjoyed the name. Whether or not this is true, I don't know. But suffice to say, Crapper is not the source of \"crap.\"\n\nSources!\n\n[This thing](http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cra1.htm)\n\n[And a dictionary!](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/crap)",

        "text": "This was interesting. I explained to this fellow with exact figures, yet they still argue that fuel shortages weren't an issue (my source being the official records of the Italian Navy, recognized in the US Library of Congress)\n\nthe OP:\n&gt;The Regia marina had some advanced battleships but against the Royal Navy, it just sat it port as a fleet in being.\n\nthe main reason why the fleets sat in port was because Italy did not have the fuel reserves to sustain continual fleet action. They physically couldn't set the ships to sail. When they did, the fleets actively engaged and hunted the British fleet (See Operation Halberd, the First and Second Battles of Sirte, and Cape Matapan as a few examples, just off the top of my head atm). Cape Matapan, however was a disaster, but it's wrong to say the Italians actively avoided the British Mediterranean fleet\n\n&gt;Oil shortage wasn't as big an issue until late in the war. The Italian fleet did actively and purposely avoid the British fleet. Italy's lack of resources and industrial capability meant it could not easily replenish lost ships which is why fleet commanders had to get approval from hq before engaging.\n\nsorry, friend, but you're wrong. The Regia Marina suffered from fuel shortages throughout the entire war, seriously effecting her ability to operate. there are official correspondences between Supermarina and Comando Supremo regarding the lack of fuel for ships. The fuel shortage was so bad as early as march, 1941 that the doctrine changed from engaging British ships, to simply entirely focusing on the protection of convoys with lighter escorts and cruisers, entirely because she couldnt sustain large fleet action with the limited fuel reserves necessary to operate.\n\n\"1940\n\nThe Regia Marina, expecting the imminent conflict against Great Britain, had planned in the years preceding the war and had been able to accumulate hefty quantities of oil fuel for her boilers to about 2 million tons. This quantity was thought sufficient for about one and one half years of war without any limitations. The Navy was the only armed force, which was able to accumulate a large quantity of fuel, and in the first week of June the Minister of Corporations withdrew 250,000 tons for the operation of industries and also for the Regia Aeronautica. The Regia Aeronautica had used tanks built of tin, instead of iron, which had caused the gasoline to spoil, so the Navy had to transfer 50,000 tons of gasoline.\n\nItaly entered the war not only with the most complete lack of readiness of her armed forces, but also without much fuel. It was thought that the war would not have last long and that the little fuel reserve would be sufficient. As a matter of fact, until January 1941, there were no limitations on the use of oil fuel, but during this month 671,560 tons had already been burned. Supermarina was forced to reduce training. Up to that moment, no large shipment of oil fuel had been acquired to replace the spent one. The 50,000 tons coming from Rumania were all destined to the Regio Esercito and civilian use, while the Regia Aeronautica benefited from 200,000 tons of very poor quality oil coming from the Albanian oil wells. The Regia Marina even attempted to increase domestic production obtaining annually 10,000 tons of low-grade fuel. The first replenishment was only 15,000 tons and it arrived from Rumania as part of an extraordinary shipment.\n\n1941\n\nTo worsen this situation came the attempted coup d’ètat in Rumania, which tried to replace the pro German government. Despite Rome’s denial, it was common opinion that the Italian government had supported this action and therefore all shipments of fuel were immediately ceased. For the Regia Marina this situation meant that in addition to losing any hope of replainge the oil fuel burned, 250,000 tons had to be transferred to the Ministry of Corporations which declared it \"intangible\" while an additional 34,000 tons had to be transferred to the national industry. During 1941, Italy was only able to import 600,000 tons of fuel and of this 163,000 tons were \"donated\" to the Navy. At this point the situation became really dramatic and the monthly consumption had to be reduced to 60,000 tons. The total amount of oil fuel available at the end of the year was about 200,000 tons and during this period of crisis it was decided to remove from service the older battleships. To worsen this already negative situation, after the November British attack in Egypt, the high command and Mussolini requested that the fleet defend the Libya-bound convoys. This strain, which eventually paid off, was only possible thanks to the special shipment of 80,000 tons of German oil fuel, which was delivered at the end of the year.\n\n1942\n\nOn January 10th, 1942 Admiral Riccardi informed the Germans that the Navy’s supplies of fuel had gone down to 90,000 tons. Admiral De Courten, in his memoirs, affirms that in that month the actual reserves were 200,000 tons. This discrepancy can be explained by the 130,000 tons of \"intangible\" fuel assigned to the corporation. During these months, the bottom was finally reached with reserves down to 14,000 tons. The situation was further deteriorated by the shipment of 9,000 tons of German oil fuel of quality too low to be of any use.\n\nFortunately, at the end of April, it was possible to start importing 50,000 tons of oil fuel per month from Rumania. Suspending the escort and mining missions conducted by the cruisers further reduced consumption. These precautions and new shipments allowed for the deployment of the whole fleet in the double operation (east and west) during the battle of mid-June. [Sic. this is the important part. The mid-June 1942 donation of fuel allowed Sueprmarina to resume deploy the whole fleet, something they haven't been able to do since the start of the war. However...] Despite the new shipment, the situation kept deteriorating because, up to the armistice, the Regia Marina transferred 40,000 tons to other units and only two shipments of German fuel (10,000 tons in July and 23,000 in September) were received. These shipments allowed for the deployment (then cancelled), of some cruisers during the battle of mid-August and the replenishment of the bunkers aboard the two naval squadrons. At the end of November, the oil fuel reserve was about 70,000 tons plus all which was stored aboard the ships; enough for one sortie of the whole fleet. At the end of December, the old battleships Cesare, Duilio and Doria were removed from service, thus allowing for their crews to be redeployed to new escort units which were just entering service.\n\n1943\n\nThe allied landing in North Africa and the subsequent doubling in consumption was the new event which, once again, placed the Regia Marina in a state of crisis. In fact, now instead of just refurnishing Libya, the Navy had to supply Tunisia. These new missions were made possible by the shipment of 40,000 tons of excellent German oil fuel. In January 1943, the crisis reached its climax and the three modern battleships had to be removed from service thus eliminating the Italian battle force. The only naval division still operating was the 3rd, based in La Maddalena (Sardinia). The crisis worsened with only 3,000 tons received in February 1943 and in March and April the modern destroyers had to be removed from escort missions. Meanwhile, on the 10th of April, the only major naval force, the 3rd Division, was annihilated when the Trieste was sunk and the Gorizia seriously damaged by an allied air bombardment. Expecting a possible Allied invasion, the remaining destroyers were reactivated along with the battleships which had half their bunkers filled with diesel fuel used by submarines.\n\nIn the month of April, the 9th and 7th Divisions were active and the destroyers were used in escort missions. It must be noted that, at this point, there was no reserve of oil fuel left; so, how did the Regia Marina reach Malta? To find the answer, we have to step back. When the Germans unexpectedly occupied the French base of Toulon on November 27, 1942, where most of the French fleet still afloat was kept, they were able to capture 80,000 tons of oil fuel. Having realized that the Regia Marina could not launch any offensive mission, the Germans transferred \"on loan\" 60,000 tons of \"special\" oil fuel thus allowing for the three battleships to be reactivated, along with the cruisers of the 7th and 8th Division, the light cruisers based in Taranto, and, at the end of June, the two battleships Doria and Duilio, while the Cesare was in Trieste being rebuilt. This oil fuel allowed for several training missions, event which had not happened in a long time. The final mission was not even compromised by the total cessation of German supplies following Mussolini’s fall. In fact when Italy surrendered on September 8th, the Fleet had enough fuel to reach and surrender in Malta.\"\n\n[Source](http://www.regiamarina.net/detail_text.asp?nid=125&amp;lid=1)\n\nthese same figures are also noted in The Italian Navy in WWII, by James J. Sadkovich. The idea that the Italian navy hid from the Royal navy is a myth, and lingering wartime propaganda\n\n\n&gt;the Regia marina approached the concept of fleet in being before oil shortages were even an issue. After a less than auspicious start against the Royal Navy, the Regia marine shifted to the fleet in being concept well before the battle of taranto in 1940. From your own link, in 1940, the Italians had almost 1.5 years supply of oil used without limitations. No, the greater threat to the Italian navy was the lack of industrial capability. \n\n\"[1940- 2 million tons of fuel at the outbreak of war] This quantity **was thought sufficient** for about one and one half years of war without any limitations... in the first week of June the Minister of Corporations withdrew 250,000 tons for the operation of industries and also for the Regia Aeronautica. The Regia Aeronautica had used tanks built of tin, instead of iron, which had caused the gasoline to spoil, so the Navy had to transfer 50,000 tons of gasoline.\n\nItaly entered the war not only with the most complete lack of readiness of her armed forces, but also without much fuel. It was thought that the war would not have last long and that the little fuel reserve would be sufficient. As a matter of fact, until January 1941, there were no limitations on the use of oil fuel, but during this month 671,560 tons had already been burned. Supermarina was forced to reduce training. Up to that moment, no large shipment of oil fuel had been acquired to replace the spent one.\"\n\nThis was January, 1941- 4 months of combat where there were no limitations and, per the source, ~50% of fuel was used or spent in other departments. there is no way you can argue the fuel crisis was not an issue from the beginning.\n\n&gt;They could not replace any ship larger than a destroyer. \n\nThis is a blatantly FALSE statement, see the Battleship Roma for example. Or the repairs to the battleship Littorio after Taranto, where she was repaired after 3 months from 3 torpedo blows.\n\n&gt; All the oil in the world matters not if you have to face the battleships and carriers of the Royal Navy with destroyers. To say that oil also limited offensives were false, after the sinking of two battleships by Italian mines and two more in the pacific, the Royal Navy was weakened enough for the Regia marina to mount offensivesz. \n\nYes, after Mid-June 1942 when Germany donated fuel form Vichy France to the Regia Marina, for a little event called Operation Vigorous and Pedestal... Which could not have happened without these fuel reserves...\n\n&gt;Two of which you mentioned. Oil was a consideration but not the most important one. Even technology and training Come before oil. The axis suffered from oil shortages throughout the entire war. The oil shortage didn't reach the crisis point until 1942/43...\n\n&gt;...The oil shortage didn't reach the crisis point until 1942/43\n\nExcept it absolutely was a crisis, throughout the entire war.... Per the source... You will see that no less than 4 Italian Battleships were decommissioned by November 1942 because they could not spare the fuel to operate them.\n\nFuel is the reason the fleets rarely left Harbor. Not the threat of having to rebuild... It was irrefutably lack of fuel reserves. ",

        "text": "I've got a new pal recently, but it turns out he's a pretty big Wehraboo, and I mean \"Wehrmacht was only defending their families\" and \"Russia was just as bad\" kind of big. It's been more than a week since we had a chat, so I guess it's time to post this here. My heart wouldn't let me post it on SWS, since he seemed like a nice guy and I don't want to put him through that, but I will post it here, just so some educated people can share their opinions. Maybe I'm wrong and he's right on some things, or maybe not. We'll see.\n\nI apologize in advance if I come off as too aggressive. I get heated up when it comes to \"debates\" like this. **If anyone doesn't want to go through all of this, you can jump at the end for the highlights.**\n\n******************\n\n&gt; Rommel was truly a brilliant, capable general and a good man. It's true, Deutsche Afrika Korps was one of the German units which didn't committed war crimes.\n\nWe're off to a nice start. Nothing blatantly wrong, but sets the tone for the rest of the conversation.\n\n&gt; Furthermore Rommel always managed to fight a \"War without hate\" as Churchill once stated. He disobeyed Hitler's orders to execute captured British commandos and he refused to deport Jews, he also spoke with Hitler about the so called Final Solution;\n\nHe was also supposed to attach the Einsatzgruppe Egypt to his Afrika Korps. Good thing his defeat saved him from having to bear that responsibility, same as his absence from the East saved him from having to partake in the terrible crimes going on there.\n\n[Here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1x6ny0/rommel_did_nothing_wrong_appears_in_the_most/) is a nice thread on BadHistory about Rommel's moral qualities, if anyone cares for some extra reasons.\n\n&gt; I never said anything beyond the fact that Rommel was only a good man and a good leader but not a good general.\n\nWait, you said he was not only a good general, but a brilliant one! I'll take it that I changed your mind.\n\n&gt; As for the books, I'm still reading Tigers in the Mud and have Achtung-Panzer, The Rommel Papers, The Memoirs of Field-Marshal Kesselring, and Generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock: The War Diary 1939-1945 waiting to be read (in that order) before I move on to either America or Britain, depending on what books I find first.\n\nHmm, there's something strange about those sources… they all sound so… German. And he called me biased. Nope, Allied sources have to wait.\n\n&gt; Look, I wouldn't ever bother to type if I didn't know what I'm saying. You guys talk about logistics but ignore how Lybian logistic routes (which were competence of Italian Army since DAK was an expeditionary force on Italian soil) were awful, especially compared with the more efficient British supply lines. Herr Rommel managed to do the best with what he had.\n\nThis is a point that he brings up time and time again, despite any counter-argument presented. Rommel was a Field Marshal. It was his job to calculate what could and what could not be done. He can't blame the Italians or anyone else for gambling with his supply lines. He should have known better, especially since his orders were not to attack. He went against order and wasted precious resources.\n\nLike UnsinkableNippon put it: \"Rommel decided to ignore all principles of rational logistics, accepted a battle of attrition, and predictably lost.\"\n\n&gt; Frankly and with all my respect for AskHistorians I don't feel the need to go to a subreddit to hear things that I believe I already know\n\nThat's the spirit! Never question your beliefs if you're certain of them.\n\n&gt; I clearly understand that the misconception which sees every German soldier during WWII as a bloodthirsty monster is so damn laughable.\n\nTrue that. Only 20% of them were bloodthirsty monsters. Around 60% did it out of peer pressure and the rest avoided doing it by various means.[^1](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3xc03h/just_how_much_of_the_wehrmacht_was_dirty/cy3cxs0)\n\n&gt; German soldiers were men like anyother and they were doing their duty, they defended their homeland and their dears just as any soldier of any Nation would have done and did. I have the same respect for any soldier involved in WWII regardless of their faction.\n\nAnd this is where I couldn't stop laughing. Those soldiers invading Poland? Just to defend their homeland! Invading the Soviet Union? We were only trying to defend our families, guys! The Hunger Plan? What was that again? For God sake, the Germans invaded a ton of countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway and Western Poland. How in the name of God were they defending their families by cutting a path of conquest and destruction across Europe and plundering everything?\n\n&gt; Did I say that Herr Rommel was an infallible general without flaws? \n\nI don't know, what does brilliant mean? \n\n&gt; Do I recognize his chivalrous behavior and his tactical (pay attention to the word \"tactical\") genius? Yes I do. First of all I hope you know the difference between tactic and strategy. Herr Rommel was a great tactician; but not so great in strategy, I might agree with you if you argue that the entire control of Westwall in 1944 might have been too much for him.\n\nI guess I should be happy I convinced him Rommel wasn't the best strategist and sucked at logistics. Then again, he comes back later with the \"it wasn't Rommel's fault that he ran out of supplies\" argument, so I can't say even that.\n\n&gt; True, Rommel wasn't so great in matter of logistics, after all it wasn't his competence, but again, how can you blame him when in North Africa, logistic routes were almost absent and under Italian control?\n\nAh, there we have it. Not his fault. He would have conquered Africa if it wasn't for those incapable Italians!\n\n&gt; I confirm what I stated before, he did the best with what he had. He has been particulary capable to beat up Monty and to stand his ground against a numerical advantaged and fully supplied enemy until DAK ran out of supplies.\n\nMontgomery, one of the most underrated generals of WW2, against Rommel, one of the most overrated. The common myth, right here. But we'll talk about Monty a bit later.\n\n&gt; While you cry about how he wasn't a good general keep in mind that he was praised by allies as well as enemies for his tactics in North Africa and he was an example for his men, also the man behind the general had an inspirational nature and a great emphatic compassion.\n\nBecause your enemies are bound not to overestimate you! Because your contemporaries are far better suited to judge you than future historians and their overrated ability of hindsight!\n\nThe opinions of contemporary leaders is valuable, but not infallible. I have more trust in historians from the present, as hindsight is superior. There was no way for contemporary leaders to see the whole picture.\n\n&gt; About your question on whether I believe or not Wehrmacht was \"clean\" let me say that Wehrmacht committed its dose of crimes, it wasn't entirely \"clean\" just like SS weren't entirely \"dirty\", keep also in mind that every faction involved in almost every important war committed some warcrime.\n\nYeah, the Wehrmacht was no worse than the Allies. And the SS wasn't entirely dirty either, even if they were a completely volunteer force, early on at least. At least the Wehrmacht had the benefit of doubt because they were conscripted.\n\n&gt; To conclude, I think I already know enough about Rommel to be able to express a judgement.\n\nObviously you don't.\n\n&gt; As I said German soldiers during the war were men like anyother, they didn't die more or less \"honorably\" than other soldiers nor their death was more or less deserved than others men.\n\nTell that to the Poles and the Jews, among others.\n\n&gt; No, cautious is not the word I would use for Monty. He throwed at Rommel many counterattacks during the Campaign which were always repelled with resolution. Eventually after many tries he managed to route an ill-supplied enemy in numerical disadvantage at least until that enemy reorganized and pushed deepest after Tobruk, then after a struggle he managed to turn the tide of the African Campaign to his side, mainly because enemy's logistic issues for whcih, again, we can't blame only Rommel, because as I already said logistic routes were under Italian control and moreover Regia Marina was losing the battle of the Mediterrean against Royal Navy who then had clear way to undermine the already awful Axis supply transportation from Europe to North Africa.\n\nNope, having to face a heavily entrenched German army with superior equipment and navigate through an extensive minefield Montgomery handed Britain their first decisive victory over Germany.[^1](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/47f4lm/with_the_hand_montgomery_was_dealt_in_north/)  More in the highlights at the end.\n\n&gt; Yes you read correctly, the \"All SS were evil villains\" misconception is totally bullshit. First SS is a generic term, there were mainly two groups of SS, Allgemeine-SS (for general purposes) and Waffen-SS (fighting SS) in many German war memories is often recalled how among Allied soldiers there was this \"SS demonization\", this led to various execution of SS POWs just because they were SS (now that's a warcrime) even though many SS units never committed a single cime during the war.\n\nYeah, that's a war crime. What happened in Poland and the Eastern front wasn't. I wonder how many SS units never committed a single crime.\n\n&gt; Waffen-SS especially were just like their Wehrmacht counterparts (there were many units of foreigner volunteers too; for instance Estonian SS which besides weren't even considered a criminal organization by the Nurnemberg Trial since they were recognized to fight for their Country against the Soviet occupation).\n\nNow, as much as I hate quoting Wikipedia, [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS#War_crimes). Waffen or not, they were a bunch of bloody war criminals, the most of them. The Waffen-SS was declared a criminal organization, except conscripts from 1943 onward, who had been forced to join. Not because they were defending their country, but because they had been forced to join.\n\n&gt; Countrary to the popular belief Wehrmacht units (and SS units in a limited extent) were a melting pot of ideologies, especially in the late war period many soldiers started to see the Fuhrer in the best case as a crazy megalomaniac and a dumb politician.\n\n[citation needed]\n\n&gt; And all of this leads us to the point two: A laughable dualist black and white vision which had its origin in the post-war period. In the immediate post-war the victors started a campaign of demonization of German soldiers whose effects last to this day.\n\nPost-war? Oh, you mean the period where the \"Clean Wehrmacht\" myth was formed by the west to warm people up on the Wehrmacht?\n\n&gt; If we really have to assign an award for the \"dirtiest\" army of WW2 then I belive that said medal would be assigned to RKKA.\n\nSo on one side we have the army that invaded a country in order to starve to death the entire population and was encouraged to commit any war crime without consequence because of that, and on the other an army that fought to defend the population against those who would exterminate them. The Germans were only fighting at Stalingrad and Leningrad to defend their families, guys! \n\n&gt; And I'm the Wehraboo ? Seems more that you suffer too much of the Victor-syndrome. Now, you're really showing an Alliedboo/RKKAboo attitude here, if we can call it that.\n\nVictor-syndrome. VICTOR-SYNDROME! Jesus Christ that was by far the most hilarious part of the whole conversation. I'm a Alliedboo/RKKAboo, because I believe in the history written by the victors.\n\n&gt; I won't repeat myself once more, Herr Rommel was a tactical genius, he fought until the bitter end in North Africa,\n\nAgainst orders and common sense as much as against the Allies.\n\n&gt; On the other hand he wasn't a strategist, he had his little part of fault for logistic issues\n\nAh, there we go again. Not his fault. How many times did he say this already? And he wasn't a strategist? He was a bloody Field Marshal! You said he was a brilliant general! Stop contradicting yourself!\n\n&gt; Nevertheless Rommel was a good general and a good man.\n\nAnd we've gone full circle. From \"brilliant general\", to \"not a good general\" and back to \"good general\". Exact quotes right there. He wasn't a strategist, he said. Jesus Christ, my head hurts.\n\n&gt; You seem to have that dualist vision which I cited earlier. You blame Wehermacht and you say they had fought \"for the perpetrators of Holocaust\", it's not really like this, they fought for Germany, which happened to be under the rule of those who perpetrated Holocaust.\n\nI don't even know what to say here, really. How is what I said any different than what he said? \n\nNope, it was a pure coincidence that Germany was controlled by the Nazis. The Wehrmacht didn't even know!\n\n&gt; But I smirked when I noticed how you praised RKKA. Yes, the \"Great Patriotic War of the Soviet liberators\" story can be compelling for most of the people; suddendly it's a laughable concept. The perpetrators of Holodomor, Dekulakization, Collectivizations and Katyn massacre (just to cite few) weren't better than the perpetrators of Holocaust.\n\nYeah, because putting people on trains to send them to industrialized genocide camps to gas them is just as bad as being incapable leaders that apply bad economic policies that lead to famines. But I digress, the Soviet soldier wasn't fighting to enable his leaders to commit genocide. He was fighting to defend his nation. \n\n&gt; Yet, do I respect a Soviet soldier less than an American, British, Italian or German soldier? No. Do I think he deserved to die more or less than another soldier from another Nation involved in the War? No. They were all men for God's sake, how can you make differences between them? They all did their duty and they fought for their Nations.\n\nYes, some fought for a nation that sought to massacre entire races, they fought to enable their nation to do so, while the others fought to stop them. They're equal, aren't they?\n\n&gt; As for political commissars' executions you catch me a bit unprepared, For what I know USSR never signed Geneva Conventions on the treatment of POWs (While Germany did), I don't know if this made those executions if not lawful at least juridical acceptable albeit those weren't ethicals. On both sides, many times when POWs were taken they were treated with a quick gunshot at their heads.\n\nYeah, juridically acceptable. Because the Germans that did sign Geneva sure as hell respected the rules.\n\nGermany wasn't much about respecting treaties. Wehraboos and apologists go and say that Britain and France were the aggressors, because they declared war. Germany obviously didn't need to declare war to invade Poland. They sure as hell didn't give a shit about any pole the way they treated them (oh, wait, they were partisans, kill them all!), and there's the Wehrmacht over there doing the crimes, not just the SS.\n\nWhat about the plan to starve every Slav to death? Was that juridical acceptable?\n\n&gt; The last source I recall to have read who mentioned the melting pot of ideologies in the Wehrmacht were Otto Carius' war memories \"Tiger im Schlamm\" when he explains this common misconception of \"German soldier all bad Nazis monsters\" and reports that in his sole company there were at least a socialdemocratic and a monarchic.\n\nOtto Carius. The best source ever.\n\nSocialdemocratic and monarchic. And yet they fought with pride for a genocidal psychopath up to the bloody end.\n\n&gt; Same here, I gave up when I read that line of yours and I won't reply further. I lost any interest in a furhter debate. It's sad thought that you can't get rid of that dualistic (black-white / good-evil) point of view, I had higher expectations from you. But it's okay, go ahead call me a Wehraboo if you want, just keep in mind that for me, for now on you're a confirmed RKKAboo in that case.\n\nYeah. I'm a RKKAboo, mates. The tea drinking, Iron Duke loving, MaxRavenclaw is a RKKAboo for calling the Soviets the second most terrible army in WW2, after the Germans and Japanese (both share first place), when talking about war crimes.\n\n&gt; I wouldn't call guarding grain silos with armed soldiers a form of murder through neglect but I agree, let's not go OT in this already OT thread.\n\nNeither would I call standing guard at a concentration camp defending one's family.\n\n&gt; Just read Carius' Tiger im Schlamm and you'll get an unbiased idea about the Tiger.\n\nUnbiased? It's written by a guy who fought in a Tiger most of his career. How is it unbiased? Steven Zaloga is what I'd call unbiased, not a German panzer ace.\n\n&gt; Besides don't talk about sources when all of your so called sources were other subreddits\n\nSo, who's better? You guys tell me. Otto Carius or Steven Zaloga and /r/AskHistorians?\n\n&gt; one day Hitler decided to throw a knife in the back of his new pal Stalin, Wehrmacht being the armed force of Germany (you know?) attacked, now tell me why you should blame soldiers and generals for Hitler's decisions. You see ? It's ridicoulous.\nNo Germans weren't worse nor better than Soviets, they all fought for their Nations, I can only respect this commitment from both of the sides.\n\nOne day? Yeah, that day was sometime before he wrote Mein Kampf. He didn't just wake up one morning and said, \"You know what? I'll stab my good friend in the back.\" Stalin and Hitler never were friends. They merely worked together to expand their territories. They were accomplices, not pals.

I'm not saying that every individual soldier was evil, but the institution in itself fought for something wrong.\n\nI'll end with a quote from a reddit user (sBcNikita) that I found almost poetic.\n\n&gt; Any German soldier who died before 1943 died in support of the violent invasions of country after country across Europe, obeying the orders of the very despotic, genocidal state responsible for plunging the entire world into the most destructive conflict in human history and enabling some of the largest mass killings the earth has ever seen. As a fellow human being, he has my sympathy, but I will not mourn for him.\n\n&gt; Any German soldier dying after 1943 fell to prolong Nazi Germany's inevitable defeat, all while subjecting his own countrymen to the continued carnage of war and simultaneously bleeding life from thousands of fellow young men in the opposing allied armies. He too has my sympathy, but I will not mourn for him either.\n\n&gt; I'm sure Fritz, Hans, and Gunther were swell fellows, but no matter what point of the war you look at, there was no nobility to any of their deaths. Just a massive tragedy, made possible by the greed of the regime whose banner they marched under.\n\n&gt; Some may have been brave men. Some may even have been good men. If the country they fought for had shared those virtues, however, there would have been no need to bury them in the millions.\n\n&gt; Individually, how guilty were they? That's irrelevant. Collectively, they deserved nothing more than the defeat that the rest of the world bestowed upon them--at a terrible cost.\n\n******************** \n\n# Highlights of the \"debate\":\n\n&gt; Frankly and with all my respect for AskHistorians I don't feel the need to go to a subreddit to hear things that I believe I already know\n\nThat's the spirit!

        "text": "There is a certain kind of Catholic who loves—and I mean *really* loves—Hierarchy. They tend to be the sort who condemn democracy, pluralism, and most any kind of social freedom. It goes without saying that not all Catholics are like this, of course—most of the Catholic brothers and sisters around here, to take but one example, are enthusiastic contributors to the democracies of America or any other in which they’re found. But there is a minority who are more devoted to Hierarchy (note the capital) than may be wise, and those sorts of Catholics often fall into rather unfortunate errors of historical interpretation. They will often jump to the defense of any sort of authoritarian state or rigidly stratified society, regardless of whether or not such societies were actually nice places to live, or even notably Catholic. We can see such errors in the article I present for dissection today: A sanguine apologia for the late and unlamented (by everyone aside from Leeaboos, libertardians, and other assorted right-wing riff-raff) Confederacy given to us by “the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.”\n\n\nA brief aside: I’m sure at least a few of my Catholic readers will be groaning at the sight of that name. While the Slaves (that’s what they call themselves, and you’ll see the irony as this review goes on) are apparently currently in good standing with the greater Catholic Church as a whole (this was not always the case), they certainly have a reputation for being one of its more obstinately right-wing branches.  But while mocking such a group may perhaps be low-hanging fruit, I’m in the mood for both an easy snack and a smackdown of some Lost Cause nonsense. So let’s take a look at the article “Catholicism and the Old South,” by Gary Potter, up at the official online journal of the Slaves (the New Hampshire branch, at least), Catholicism.org. Love the name, by the way, gotta tell everybody that they’re the Real True and Honest Official Catholics. Anyways, let’s check it out:\n\n\nhttp://catholicism.org/catholicism-south.html\n\n\nPotter’s essay begins with a couple of anecdotes that supposedly demonstrate the affinity the Catholic Church had for the Confederate cause. Pope Pius IX sent SCA President Davis a religious gift while he was in prison, and some Catholic nuns sent him a rosary as well. Some nuns (perhaps the same who sent him the rosary) gave his wife some help when she was impoverished after the war. According to Potter, who spends the rest of his essay arguing the point, such charming little incidents reflected the fact that the Confederacy had been a “more Catholic” nation than its Union opponent (despite neither country being majority-Catholic). Its “agricultural” and “hierarchical” mode of life was more in keeping with Catholic social teaching, and Potter claims that had the South won, a “Catholic civilization” might have arisen in the Anglophone world of North America. Granted, the sticky issue of slavery might make that seem less attractive at first, but not to worry: Potter assures us that the North was even more racist than the South, the Civil War wasn’t really about slavery, and in any case slavery wasn’t so bad and Christianized the happy and contented slaves.\n\n\nIt will hopefully go without saying that this review will refute each of those assertions.\n\n\nThe opening anecdotes alone reveal some of the issues with this piece as a whole. I won’t even bother commenting on their factual accuracy—some people in the comments themselves note that Davis probably received the “crown of thorns” gift from his wife, not the Pope. But take a good look at Potter’s cloying sympathy for Jefferson Davis in prison. Those boorish Yankees treated him so poorly, even posting guards around while he had to use the facilities! It’s rather telling that Potter doesn’t say a word about how those oh-so-honorable rebels treated prisoners at Andersonville—or what they did to black soldiers who surrendered, for that matter. A myopic (to put it lightly) whitewashing of the South’s sins mixed with an equally blind focus on those of the North (and I’m not denying many Northerners were racist, profited off of slavery, etc., one can’t deny Copperheads existed) pervades pretty much this entire essay. \n\n\nOf course, good-old fashioned oversimplifications and misinterpretations make outsized appearances too. Potter’s description of the “Catholic” nature of Southern institutions is full of them. He claims “the Catholic influence in American society was much stronger in the less populous South than in the North at the time of the war…there was no place in the North at the time of the war that could be described as Catholic the way, for instance, New Orleans could…In a region where family mattered, numerous leading families were Catholic…Even when the leading families of the South were not Catholic — and most were not — they tended to have a high regard and deep respect for the Church and her institutions, especially her schools.” \n\nThis is, to be fair, not entirely inaccurate. Recent scholarship has found that Catholicism was not much less well-represented in the South than it was in the North. Dennis Rousey’s 2006 article, “Catholics in the Old South: Their Population, Institutional Development, and Relations with Protestants” took a look a demographic data and church statistics to find that Catholic churches made up a roughly equal proportion of churches in urban areas in the North and South (22 and 21 percent, respectively) in 1860. It was only in rural areas that the North had markedly more Catholic churches; Catholic places of worship were 8% of rural churches up there compared to 2% down there. Rousey also notes that Southern Catholics generally suffered less from bigotry and prejudice than Northern ones did; while the Know-Nothing party was active in both regions, outright violence and vandalism of Catholic churches was less common in the South. \n\n\nIf Potter could read this right now, he might be smirking and saying to himself, “see? I was right!” But a closer examination of Potter’s claims in light of Rousey’s article just might prove embarrassing. Potter goes on to assert that Catholicism suited the Old South for reasons described by the poet Allen Tate. He summarizes Tate by saying “[The Old South was] the only truly European civilization ever known in America. That is in the sense that it was a civilization rooted in its own soil. It was one that produced men who measured their success in life according to non-material standards, perhaps the chief of them being honor. It was an agricultural civilization, and a hierarchical one. That by itself was enough to make Pius or even most ordinary Catholics of the day sympathetic to the South.”\n\n\nThere are many things wrong with this, but we can find the first immediately in Potter’s “rooted in its own soil” and “agricultural civilization” praise of the South. As Rousey’s article notes, *only in urban areas* did Catholicism in the South approach the representation it had in the North. Rousey states this explicitly on page 7: “Taken together, Catholics, Jews, Lutherans, and Episcopalians in 1860 accounted for 44.5% of church accommodations in the urban South, compared with just 7.7% in the rural South. The presence of so many religious nonevangelicals, as well as the material acquisitiveness, transience, and anonymity associated with an urban market economy, defined a distinctive urban culture marked by much greater religious diversity, tolerance, worldliness, and irreligion than the culture of the southern countryside.” Southern Catholicism found its most fertile ground in the pluralistic, mercantile, and worldly city--*not* the bucolic agrarian regions Potter idealizes. \n\n\nHis idealization of “Southern Honor” is equally unconvincing, at least for an educated reader. As Bertram Wyatt-Brown’s seminal monograph, along with others such as Kenneth Brown’s Honor and Slavery have made clear, the Southern honor Potter praises involved dueling, gambling, cockfighting, and a variety of other activities ranging from cruel to stupid to both. Not the sorts of things a guy like, say, St. Francis (the gentle Catholic saint known for his love of animals) would particularly approve of. \n\n\nEven that would be too generous to Potter’s argument—because his insinuation that Southerners weren’t concerned with making money is hilariously wrong. As much as they may have talked big about honor, the lords of the lash cared as much about profit as the “commercial types” of the North did. A primary source demonstrating this would be the (vastly wealthy) James Hammond’s personal diaries, in which his lamentations for the deaths of his slaves are almost always mixed in with lamentations for the shrinking of his pocketbook. Hammond’s reaction to the illness of a pair of male slaves on his plantation was quite telling: “if God would only allow my negroes to live and thrive and give me reasonable health, I could stand the rest and fight it out with the world…If my negroes increased as they ought, I should feel that I had a fund growing for my children, and I would cheerfully apply myself to every labor of improvement or retrenchment to keep even with the world. But why be industrious when the fruits are struck down by death.”  \n\n\nOne might praise Hammond’s concern for his children’s financial standing, but you cannot deny that Hammond’s concern for his slaves was primarily pecuniary, not affectionate. He was concerned about his pocketbook above all else, every bit as much as some “mercantile Yankee.” For even more proof of just how greedy the “honorable” South really was, check out the many essays in *The Old South’s Modern Worlds,* or Walter Johnson’s *River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom*, or of course Edward Baptist’s *The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism*. Now, to be sure, all of these works make clear that many Northerners supported and profited from slavery as well—there’s even a book, *Ebony and Ivy,* that explores the massive amount of money prestigious Ivy League colleges in New England made from dealing with slave traders. But every time Potter brings up Northern racism or proslavery sentiment, he uses the point to conclude that the Southerners were both less racist and nobler in their aims. This is nonsense. To claim, as Potter does, that Southerners were “motivated by loftier goals than moneymaking” is pure delusion.\n\n\nIt is upon this delusion that Potter asserts the Vatican and the Pope were sympathetic to the Confederacy, and of course, a bit of reading will find his assertion to be quite incorrect. “Why did Pius, alone among European heads of state, extend recognition?” Potter asks. “On this score, there is no particular historical document to which the historian can refer... We can still arrive at a likely explanation. This will be by coming to a deeper understanding of Southern culture, of the Southern way of life.”\n\n\nWell, no, sorry to disappoint you, Potter. David J. Alvarez has another good article in *The Catholic Historical Review* on the Pope’s views on the Civil War. In the early 1860s, the Pope feared losing support from Catholic countries such as France and Spain, and therefore felt “the prospect of a regenerated Union promised relief for the diplomatic ills of the Papacy”—that is to say, the Papacy wanted a Northern victory and suppression of the rebellion. When Northerners met with military setbacks in 1862, Pius encouraged American clergymen like Archbishop John Hughes (of New York) and Archbishop John Odin (of New Orleans) to “conciliate the minds of the combatants” in order to stop more blood from being shed. Further lack of Northern progress combined with the Emancipation Proclamation (ironically enough) was what dimmed the Pope’s view of the Union. Pius received a missive from Martin Spalding defending the South and warning that emancipation would lead to slave rebellion (this is a point Potter also makes and which was also incorrect, as we will see shortly). Only after that point did Pius even agree to meet with Confederate officials, and a Roman cardinal, Giacomo Antonelli, stated that the “overtures” Pius sent to the Confederacy were merely diplomatic niceties and not formal recognitions. Pius supposedly stated to a British diplomat that his sympathies were with the Confederacy, but this seems to have been due to his mistaken assumption that the Emancipation Proclamation was intended to spark a slave rebellion.  In short, then, it seems that Pius’ *changing* attitude towards the Confederacy was based on a variety of factors, ranging from Union successes to fear of social disorder—not on any affinity for a “hierarchical” or “agrarian” civilization.\n\n\nPotter’s delusions continue with his excursions into alternate history. This is not the only offending paragraph, but it sums up the worst of this essay well enough:\n\n\n“What if the South had succeeded in establishing its independence? At least there would have been an American nation in the mid-nineteenth century marked by a strong Catholic influence. Further, the children sent to Southern Catholic schools by leading families would have grown up and taken their positions as leaders of society; slavery doubtless would have ended; the waves of European Catholic immigrants at the end of the century and beginning of this one would probably have washed onto Southern shores instead of flooding Northern cities, possibly neutralizing or even submerging the “Teutonic Puritanism of the New England textile manufacturers” embraced by too many in the South; and there could have arisen an English-speaking Catholic nation in North America.”\n\n\nAllow me another aside on this first—even if the South had won, it’s very, very far from certain the Confederacy would have turned into some Catholic haven. Despite the prominence of Catholicism in New Orleans and positive feelings for Catholics among the general populace engendered by Catholic charity during the war, some Southerners took a very, very dim view of “Popery.” Robert Lewis Dabney comes to mind—a fervent defender of the South and slavery, a hagiographer of Stonewall Jackson, and one of the most prominent Presbyterian theologians of 19th century America, Dabney was a staunch opponent of the Faith. In “The Attractions of Popery,” Dabney (amusingly enough) admitted that “Rome proposes herself as the stable advocate of obedience, order, and permanent authority through the ages”—that is to say, he praised it for its adherence to hierarchy. But this was not a compliment to the Church—it was an exhortation for Protestants to abjure the “pernicious” doctrines of equality so they could better combat the Church! Earlier, Dabney stated that “we believe that the Christianity left by the apostles to the primitive church was essentially what we now call Presbyterian and Protestant. Prelacy and popery speedily began to work in the bosom of that community and steadily wrought its corruption and almost its total extirpation…The grand architect was too cunning to make it, like his earlier essays, mere atheism, or mere fetishism…for in these forms the trap only ensnared the coarser and more ignorant natures. He has now perfected it and baited it for all types of humanity, the most refined as well as the most imbruted.” \n\n\nNo prizes for guessing who Dabney was referring to by “the grand architect.” He was literally calling Catholicism a product of the devil! If guys like that could serve as chaplains in the Confederate Army and professors of theology in Southern universities (look up Dabney’s biography on Wikipedia), one suspects that anti-Catholic feeling would have been just as successful as Catholicism in grasping hold of an independent Confederacy.\n\n\nThe fact that such a fervent pro-slavery man like Dabney would praise a religion he otherwise loathed for its hierarchical nature will hopefully lead the reader to strongly doubt—at the very least—Potter’s assertion that slavery would have ended with a Confederate victory. I don’t even need to refute this nonsense--/u/georgy_k_zhukov had already demonstrated quite well that the South seceded for slavery; their entire purpose was to preserve the “peculiar institution.” I’d just like to quickly refute a few of Potter’s claims he makes afterwards, in the subsection on slavery.\n\n\n1: “More to the point of these lines, there was never any Catholic effort, qua Catholic, to defend slavery. We have said there was no Catholic bishop in the South who failed to support the Confederacy. It is equally true that they did not preach about slavery as if it were anything but evil. (An exception is the French-born Bishop Augustin Verot, of Savannah, Ga., who, while defending the institution, was against its abuse, opposed the slave trade, and took great pains to help the negroes both before and after the war. He also gave succor to the Union POWs in Andersonville prison.) Catholic theologians did not try to defend it as very many Protestant preachers did, and as some Fundamentalists, citing biblical verses, still attempt to do. When Ven. Pope Pius IX agreed in 1865 to receive Bishop Lynch as envoy of the President of the C.S.A., the only condition stipulated for his reception was that slavery would not be a subject for discussion. There is no evidence that His Excellency wanted to try to discuss it or that President Davis instructed him to do so.”\n\n\nThis is straight-up false. Potter’s own favorite Confederate bishop, the Reverend Lynch, went out of his way to defend slavery. Another article from the *Catholic Historical Review* by David Heisser offers a close analysis of a pro-slavery pamphlet Lynch published (in Italian, not English; Heisser analyzes the unpublished English draft of which the Italian is an accurate translation): *Lettera di un missionario sulla schiavitu domestica degli Stati Confederati di America.* We’ll get to that in a moment, but first, a bit of background on Lynch himself: Heisser tells us that “Among Southern bishops Lynch stood out in that he had been brought up in a slaveholding family and was himself the owner of about ninety-five slaves. He and other slaveowning members of his family were benign by the lights of their day, and he characterized the institution as \"patriarchal.\"Slavery was a fundament of Southern civilization, and slaveholding was not uncommon among Catholic bishops, priests, and religious communities. Slaveownership was typical of leading Protestant and Catholic churchmen, who were among its most articulate apologists. Well-to-do Southern Catholics often owned slaves, and prominent laypeople of his diocese aided Bishop Lynch in the acquisition and management of his slaves.”  Potter sure didn’t mention any of those little factoids about the noble Bishop Lynch! A few more quotes from the pamphlet ought to embarrass Potter even further:\n\n\nLynch claimed that house slaves “receive abundant gratuities, and love to give full evidence of it in the natty hats, the broadcloth coats and the polished boots of the men, the silks and ribbons and flashy jewelry of the women, as they parade the streets or assemble in church on Sundays.\" (Ibid, 689)\n\n\nSlaves in the field “receive in strong solid food, fully as much as they can consume, and have something over to satisfy a negro's natural inclination to waste. . . . The work of the [negro] ... is light; his food is abundant; his condition is one of comfort, his necessities in sickness and old age are all provided for.\" (Ibid, 689)\n\n\nAnd of slavery as a whole, Lynch wrote “slaves of the Confederate States may ask to be left in their present state of quiet and content, awaiting the future which God only knows; and not be doomed at once to ruin, if not speedy extermination, for the sake of a mere theory.\" (Ibid, 694)\n\n\nSo Bishop Lynch claimed that slavery was good for the blacks and that they would be exterminated if emancipated! Not exactly a portrayal of slavery as a social evil. But perhaps Potter would claim that Lynch defended the institution on social-scientific rather than religious grounds, and therefore his original point still stood! Well, unfortunately, the number of Catholic prelates (in the North and South) who justified slavery on Biblical grounds, or portrayed it as not so bad, was greater than zero. Bishop Auguste Martin of Nachitoches, Louisiana, justified slavery via the Curse of Ham in a pastoral letter (Ibid, 694. Heisser also notes that, to their credit, Catholics in Rome took a very dim view of Martin’s exegesis. He also briefly describes a Confederate attempt to win recognition from Britain and France by emancipating the slaves, but by 1864 this was simply their last, desperate gasp, not an indication that the Rebels actually opposed slavery). Archbishop Hughes of New York once claimed that even if slavery were an evil, “it is not an absolute and unmitigated evil; and even if it were anything more than what it is—a comparative evil—there is one thing, that it is infinitely better than the condition in which this people [Africans] would have been, had they not been seized to gratify the avarice and cupidity of the white man.” \n\n\nSo it seems Potter is wrong on just about every count. There was at least one Catholic cleric who tried to justify slavery on Biblical grounds, and several others, such as Archbishop Hughes, claimed it was preferable for blacks to freedom in Africa. That certainly seems like he attempted to portray it as something “other than evil.”\n\n\nContinuing in his wrongness, Potter claims “Mr. Lincoln’s Proclamation “freed the slaves.” In truth, not one slave was freed because of it. It spoke of “all slaves in areas still in rebellion,” not the ones in parts of the C.S.A. already militarily occupied by Union forces, nor those in border states or anywhere else. Naturally those in “areas still in rebellion” were not freed by the Proclamation. Mr. Lincoln knew they would not be. His purpose, plain and simple, was to incite them into a rebellion of their own. In that he failed.” \n\n\nMore BS, I’m afraid. Old Abe *explicitly told* the slaves to avoid violence. From the actual text:\nhttps://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/transcript.html\n“And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.”\n\n\nAs to why Lincoln actually did deliver the proclamation, there is some debate in the historiography concerning the point (from what I understand, Allen Guelzo is one of the Great Emancipator’s most able defenders), but Mcpherson in *Battle Cry of Freedom* notes that most Union grunts wanted to emancipate the slaves so they would run away from their masters instead of continuing to grow food, make clothes, etc. for the Rebels.   They didn’t want the slaves to rise up and butcher Southern women and children, but they did want to make sure Southern soldiers were less well-fed and well-equipped thanks to the labor of slaves. Suddenly the Emancipation Proclamation doesn’t seem so “evil,” eh?\n\n\nPotter’s nugget #2: “No more than one out of fifteen Southern whites ever owned a slave. That means there were fewer than 350,000 slave-holders in all the South. Yet, about 600,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Armies. If, then, every slave-holder was in uniform — and, certainly, that was not so — there were still hundreds of thousands of soldiers with no personal stake in slavery. So much for the idea that it was to keep their slaves that Southerners fought!”\n\n\nA vast oversimplification of Southern reasons for fighting—I don’t even need a citation (and there are many) for this; simple reasoning will suffice. Even Southerners who didn’t own slaves had a vested interest in the continuation of the institution, since their relatives might have owned slaves, they realized their economy was based on slavery, just plain old racism, etc. etc. etc.\n\n\nNugget #3: “The price of an able-bodied slave at the time of the war was about $1,000 — still a fair-sized sum today and a very large amount of money in the 1860s. How many slave-holders would starve, beat or otherwise abuse such valuable property? Rare was the mistreatment of any slave.”\n\n\nAgain, no citation needed—this is a complete joke. The fact that slaves were so expensive was an incentive to brutalize them. You do not want your 1,000 dollar investment to run away or rebel. What’s a good way of doing that? Terrorizing him into submission! Even a “well-fed” and “well-treated” slave is still a slave; the human desire for freedom transcends material comfort. No matter how “benevolent” a master may be or how fat and happy he thinks his chattel are, some of them will inevitably want to be free. No amount of food or privilege can squelch that desire. The only way a master can keep that desire at bay is to make the slave too frightened, or too fearful of the consequences, to do anything but serve. That, of course, leads to the terror, beatings, and general abuse that always accompanies slavery.  \n\n\nThis is not to say that running away or rebellion were the only forms of resistance employed by slaves; historians from Eugene Genovese’s era have noted how slaves were able to “negotiate” various privileges from masters, including, yes, more food, lessened workloads, and all that good stuff. But the stick always and omnipresently accompanied the carrot, and masters always fell back on the whip when such negotiations cut into their profit margins. That slaves were able to ameliorate their conditions, to an extent (and only an extent) speaks well of their cunning, not the “benevolence” of their masters. \n\n\nFinally, this last nugget does deserve a citation. Potter claims that “most African laborers brought to America as slaves were animists. Nearly all would embrace the Christianity of their eventual owners. Is it likely they would convert to the religion of owners who brutalized them?”\n\n\nI suppose it’s not very likely, and surprise surprise, the actual history of African American Christianity is a great deal more complicated than Potter implies. I suppose our hero hasn’t read Daniel L. Fountain’s *Slavery, Civil War, and Salvation* (one of my favorite books from my orals readings last year, by the by). The whole book is excellent and I highly recommend it, but allow me to sum it up: Fountain found, going from WPA slave narratives, church statistics, etc. that genuine religious conviction (as opposed to faking piety for one’s masters or using religious gatherings as an opportunity to escape supervision) was actually fairly rare among slaves before the Civil War. Christianity only really began to attract blacks *after the Union won*; blacks took the Confederacy’s defeat and their subsequent emancipation as proof that a just God truly existed and that He delivered them from slavery just as He did for the Israelites. To quote Fountain directly on page 5, “it is possible that Christianity never replaced African-based religions until the Christian god delivered the freedom his followers had prophesied. In this way, emancipation, rather than the middle passage, served as the death knell for long-held African religious beliefs.” \nSo, once again, Potter’s account is precisely the opposite of actual reality. Slavery didn’t Christianize the slaves, emancipation—brought on by those damned boorish Yankees—did. \n\n\nThere are multitudes of other things Potter gets wrong—I’m sure our Latin American specialists would beg to differ on his characterization of the labor regimes in, say Catholic Brazil, as much more “benevolent” than anywhere else—but I’ve already spent nearly 5 thousand words on this stuff. I hope that mass of text has sufficed to satisfactorily demolish the positive picture of the Old South that Garry Potter has tried to paint. I’ll end by repeating a point I implied in the beginning of this essay—in fairness to Potter, his misapprehensions are shared not just by Leeaboos and Southerners but also by many Catholics. From what I’ve heard, Eugene Genovese started to idealize “agrarian” societies after he re-converted to Catholicism, or at least around that time, when he started reading a collection of Southern Agrarian essays titled *I’ll Take My Stand.* \n\nThis is just what I’ve heard, I haven’t read much of Genovese’s work after he converted (I suppose I should sometime). I mention this just to be fair to Potter—as foolish as he may be, he is hardly alone in his foolishness.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4cnlah/where_do_white_people_come_from_dagestan/",
        "text": "[This blog here](https://wordofreedom.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/astonishing-similarities-between-russian-culture-and-himalayan-pristine-culture/) is full of tons of comparisons between Himalayan (Himachal Pradesh), Caucasus (Dagestan), and European (Russian, Serbian, and French, among others) culture that happen to be \"astonishing\"!\n\nI've already [discussed this avenue of \"historiography\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2v59vq/smashed_by_the_hammer_of_thor_some_viking/), which consists of pointing to vague artistic similarities as evidence of shared ~~dissent~~ descent, but let's smash it some more because who doesn't love beating a dead horse?\n\n**R5 starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1**\n\n&gt;This is an interesting finding… As one day I happened to google Dagestan and its culture, I found out striking similarities it had with my own Himachali customs and pristine culture. So, I thought it will be useful to share.\n\nOy, cultural \"purity\" is hard to measure but that belongs more in /r/badsocialscience. If by purity you mean a lack of outside influence, that's not exactly true since Himachal has been invaded by [Indian Muslims, Nepalis, and later Brits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Himachal_Pradesh). The capital of Himachal Pradesh is the [purely Indo-Iranian city of Shimla](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Shimla_Montage.jpg), which was most definitely *not* the summer capital of the British Raj from 1863 to the 1940s and which most definitely is *not* full of English Tudor architecture.\n\n&gt;Let’s start with geography. Dagestan or Respublica Dagestan forms the Northern Caucasus region and is located in the southern part of Russsia. It has several ethnic groups in which Russians form a minute part but still the lingua franca of the region remains Russian. The languages of Dagestan are Caucasian, Turkic and Iranian languages.\n\nNo history here, at least not anything incorrect.\n\n&gt;Now let’s come to the cultural aspects of Dagestan. Dagestan has a very rich cultural heritage. It is famous for its jewellery, pottery and carpets. Its carpets are famous because of its proximity to Persia and as we all know that Persian carpets have been famous since ages. In fact in Dagestan, handmade rugs are the most valuable things in the household. In some area within Dagestan, they can even be traded for a few horses and in some of the others it is considered necessary for a new bride to weave a carpet all by herself.\n\nDon't know enough about this so skipping, although it sounds very outdated.\n\n&gt;And quite similar, rather almost identical is the colour scheme and design pattern of the Himlayan rug as you can see below.\n\nThose rugs aren't very similar, but skipping because /r/badarthistory.\n\n&gt;Another striking similarity comes in the form of clothing. In both the regions women use a very similar head scarf to cover their heads. In fact even the manner in which that headscarf is worn over the heads is also very similar. The heavy jewellery worn by the bride during wedding is also quite identical. It is not much difficult to draw analogy between the jewellery design and the use of silver as the predominant metal in ornaments. Below are some of the pictures of Dagestani women wearing their ornaments and native dresses. In the first pic as you can see there are coins on the headdress of the lady. It is a custom in Dagestan to have more and more coins on the headdress because more the coins, wealthier the bride’s family.\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1) Dagestan is [a predominantly Muslim region and has been for hundreds of years.](https://books.google.com/books?id=ifHj0xaf7hMC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=dagestan+islamization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wSztzYPMkQ&amp;sig=omByCqGZ1Pc4Pebgx4VL-kWSgOk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKlpjJzunLAhWJWh4KHXhZAcoQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dagestan%20islamization&amp;f=false) Muslim women around the world often wear headscarves. A shared origin that implies cultural connection is unlikely.\n\n2) Headscarves have evolved somewhat independently in many cultures, including [France](http://world4.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Traditional-clothing-Brittany-003-327x400.jpg), [indigenous South America](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Guajiran_artisans.jpg/220px-Guajiran_artisans.jpg), and among [both men and women in a variety of cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headscarf).\n\n&gt;Now have a look at the Himalayan dresses and traditional ornaments …….\n\nA bunch of these aren't even headscarves, much less recognizably \"Dagestani\" ones.\n\n&gt;In many of the pictures above, you can see the coins in Himalayan jewellery too. The intricate patterns but similar designs show too much in common. But below is one of the strangest and my favourite set of similarities. FOOTWEAR. Dagestani footwear, I mean their traditional footwear has the same colour and the design pattern as the Himalayan home slippers. The first picture below shows Dagestani footwear and the second one shows the Himalyan footwear.\n\nA lot of those have similar patterns and colors to [Amerindian textiles](http://daxisdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Pukka-Print-2013-Navajo-2_Multi.png), but that doesn't necessarily imply a shared origin. Note: be careful about what you call \"Navajo print\"; thanks to lawsuits, many retailers must call it 'Aztec print' or 'Native print' instead.\n\n&gt;The astonishing similarities may be attributed to similar geographical conditions in the two regions. Moreover, the region around Dagestan which is the Central Asian part, is said to be the origin of Aryan race and it is believed that the inhabitants of Himalayan regions were Aryans.\n\nR5: \"Aryan race\". Just kidding, but this is doubly bad. In terms of a genetic \"race\", such a thing doesn't [exist](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/1998-10/WUiS-GSRD-071098.php), and genetically speaking there are a huge number of clusters that are found in \"white\" and \"Indo-Aryan\" peoples, [not one clear white race](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ish7688voT0/TQCUSrNAtII/AAAAAAAADA0/aPauKPSLZ8Y/s1600/ADMIXTURE_13.png):\n\nThe yellow here represents a cluster found in the Indo-Iranian Kalash of Pakistan.\n\nGray is found in both Indo-Iranian and Dravidian peoples of India.\n\nPurple is found in the northern Middle East, the Caucasus, and parts of Pakistan.\n\nBlue is found in Afro-Asiatic (Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic) people, both \"black\" (like Jewish and gentile Ethiopians) and \"white\" (like Bedouin and Druze). It also is found in large numbers in the Indo-European Armenians and almost every European ethnic group.\n\nBlack is probably the most classically \"white\" cluster, found at about 80% in Scandinavians and about 40% in Mediterraneans.\n\nTL;DR: Race doesn't exist; out of the first 13 genetic clusters found in a large multi-continent sample, five are associated with \"Aryan\" peoples.\n\nIf you're talking about linguistic homeland, you're still probably wrong. There are [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_Urheimat_hypotheses) competing theories as to the homeland of the Indo-European languages (which include Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and most European languages as well as Armenian). None of them begin in Dagestan.\n\n&gt;There are many speculations about this but let’s move on to traditions.\n\n&gt;In Dagestan, as well as in countries like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, livestock is very vital part of the people’s lives. Similar trend can be seen in the Himlayan region,where livestock plays an important role in the survival. Traditional animals in Russian region are camels and horses, whereas in Himalayas these are mainly cow, sheep, goats and yaks. One of the surprising things is that Yak is considered the holy cow of the cold regions, still it is slaughtered for meat and quite similar is the trend in Russia and its former states. \n\nLivestock herding is a very common pattern of living throughout [the Old World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic_pastoralism#Nomadic_pastoralism_around_the_world), and the use of livestock says nothing about cultural origins. Even the Incas, completely isolated from Old World civilization, [used livestock](http://www.ancient.eu/article/792/).\n\n&gt;On further research, I found out that not only were the Russian dresses and customs similar to Himalayan culture. But other European adjoining nations too had a very similar dressing. Have a look at this Serbian woman.\n\nThe rest of the article is just more \"they dress similarly/have similar folk dances, and that might not be coincidence!\" fluff. ",

It's basically a weird Russian master race version of Nazism.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/35450/discussions/0/385429254944182622/#p1\n\n\n\nA few highlights:\n\n&gt;Jew - A semite, old ethnic tribe of M. E. Semites are believed to be extinct although I believe fragments of their dna remain.\n\n&gt;Zionist - A false Jew, false Slavyan, false ethnician, radical resident of zion.\n\nJews \"extinct,\" Zionists are pretending to be Slavs for some reason. Still unclear what \"racial resident\" means.\n&gt;Slavyan - Celebrator, one who celebrates Rod (birth of own kind) in Slavya (\"Heaven\" not to be confused with religious version, ethnic Russy believe Earth is heaven, hell and present), commonly misunderstood as slavs/slavic\n\n&gt;Slavs/Slavics - Non-Slavyan tribes of arab and zioni (bellow) origin purged out of North Slavia (latin Tartaria, Russian Empire) for crimes. They now live in the central europe where a project attempted to misuse the Slavia name and create Yugoslavia (YozhnayaSlaviya, south Slavia) the terrirory stands true to this name but people living there aren't ethnically connected only culturally (what they found when they migrated in) same goes for East Slavia (Asia) and West Slavia (Europe)\n\nHe uses the term \"Slavyan\" to describe Russians, distinguishing them from other Slavs. (Slavyan actually just means \"Slav\")\n\n\n&gt;Nazi - Commonly misunderstood as \"nationalist German\" this word comes from two words NAtionalist ZIonist where ZION is israel (it's grayic name). Just as for Russians and communists/bolsheviks, calling Germans Nazis is WRONG as Germans aren't ethnically related to zion and their system was abused by an outside influentor, same happened to Soviet people.\n\nMysterious \"Zion\" controlling world governments.\n\n&gt;SS - Another counterfeit on the axis front is actually two symbols (runaic letters that look like bolts but have small hooks beneath) which mean Sila Slavyan (Power of the Slavyans, commonly worn by Bogatyrs on long travels, to western people more commonly as vikings or Victorian Kings), please note that nazis are not Slavyan nor Semitic.\n\nBogatyr is a term for a travelling warrior.\n\n\n&gt;Nationalist - Also commonly misunderstood as patriot (bellow) is a word coming from ethnic Russian Karuna runes NashOnAl-Ishtar (He is one of ours) many languages today were based on the old Karuna and use this word, even Russian is a very small and trimmed version of it with Bukvitsa being a written version used for communication, old one had 44 letters each having 5 meanings, new one is short of 35 with no extra meanings.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Nationalism was coined by a German and is a relatively modern phenomenon.\n&gt;Fascist - Fash-Ishtar Flames-Person or simpler pyroman, antihuman, antiworld. \n\n&gt;Swastika (abused by nazis) - The one used by nazis is actually not really a swastika but a rune Fash, Fash is an obereg rune (wearable rune) which means flames, those who wear it are \"pyromaniacs\" or fascist on purpose.\n\nThis guy really loves his \"ethnic Russian Karuna runes,\" and shoehorns them into modern words to mean what he wants. Swastika is derived from Sanskrit, and Fascism refers to bundled sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority.\n\nAlso, extreme right-wing ideology revolves around pyromania, apparently.\n\n&gt;WW2 - Imho, it was a project to kill as many people as possible no matter who's the bad and who's the good guy, in war there's no good guys only survivors and those who orchestrate it are rulers. Some gained territory out of it, some a coutry, some lots of casualties. Regardless of its nature it was the common man who paid the full price. WW2 was also an ethnic struggle between 2 types of people. Western allies did not fully understand this event's ethnic roots thus both USA and UK and such played on both ends of Axis and Allies nonetheless having sustained casualties too.\n\n**The following is my personal interpretation of the story being told:**\n\nBy using ancient Slavic runes to write modern English words the author proves that Russians are the only true Slavs (apparently, they also travelled west, where they were  known as Vikings). All other Slavic people, known here as Zionists, are actually Middle Eastern tribes who were exiled from Russia because they were evil criminals and then pretended to be Jews, even though the actual Jews were \"extinct.\" They got revenge by forming Nazi (short for \"National Zionist\"), Fascist (derived from ancient slavic runes meaning \"pyromaniac\" and \"antihuman\") and Bolshevik parties. They then started WW2 in order to kill everybody because they are just that evil. Although the USA and the UK, who are ignorant of these ethnic origins, helped the Axis as well as the Allies (somehow), the heroic Russians defeat the Axis in spite of their own evil leaders. However, all was not well as the Zionists had started WW2 in order to get Israel, so that they could conduct ethnic cleansing there and create \"Zion.\"\n\n",

        "text": "Hello! I recently took a trip down Lost Cause Memory Lane^TM and found myself reading the [Confederate Veteran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Veteran). It was a magazine geared to the southern generation after the Civil war vets, and it ran from 1893 to 1931, or as I like to put it, 38 years too damn long. \n\nI read a memorization of Robert E. Lee printed in the Confederate Veteran XXXVIII (February 1930, pg 84) for General Lee's 123ird birthday, which Lee was unable to attend. Would you believe that it has badhistory? I hope so. This is important to debunk because the Godly representation of Lee is a core pillar of the Lost Cause, and it just goes to show that this whole cause has been lost for probably over a century by now.\n\n[Want to read along? Here it is!](https://archive.org/stream/confederateveter3819conf#page/n89/mode/2up) ALL of the Confederate Veteran is digitized. Go crazy [Georgy_K_Zhukov](https://www.reddit.com/comments/3boun3/)\n\nOkay so the memorization is written by an editor named Radford from the Virginian News Journal, and he immediately starts running into problems. You see, Radford starts remembering the memory of Lee, not the man Lee actually was. This memory was a god like gentleman, A man who understood his fellow man, who never made mistakes, who was George Washington walking among us once again. This is super obvious when poor old Radford drops us this line:\n\n&gt; Lee, one of the great military figures of history, was at heart a **pacifist**. \n\nHoldup. What? Okay. Hmmmm. Now this quote is a bit out of context, but not by much. See for yourself in the link!. I am going to take a controversial stance and say that Lee was NOT a Pacifist. It's not even a linguistic *thing*, as (according to wikipedia), The term '[Pacifism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism#Peace_movements)' was coined in 1901 and the meaning hasn't really changed in the last century. So, unless there is something crazy I am missing, Pacifism means an \"Opposition to war, military, or violence\". \n\nGeneral Lee wasn't a pacifist, or if he was, he was a shit one.\n\nFirst, Second and Third off, Robert E. Lee didn't oppose war, military, or violence. Ignoring the Civil War (*gasp!*), Lee served for the U.S. Army from 1829 to 1861, where he received a commendation for greatly distinguished service. It's important to remember that he chose to enlist into the army, and did go to West Point for the purpose of learning how to war. \n\nNot ignoring the Civil War, Lee himself says \"Save for defense of my native state, I never desire again to draw my sword.\". While that may seem to be anti-violence, all it is saying is when he would condone violence. \n\nIn conclusion, Robert E. Lee was not, at heart, a pacifist. Maybe he detested war, which he does have some pretty swell quotes on:\n\n&gt; It is well that war is so terrible, otherwise we should grow too fond of it.\n\n&gt; What a cruel thing is war; to separate and destroy families and friends, and mar the purest joys and happiness God has granted us in this world; to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbours, and to devastate the fair face of this beautiful world! I pray that, on this day when only peace and good-will are preached to mankind, better thoughts may fill the hearts of our enemies and turn them to peace. … My heart bleeds at the death of every one of our gallant men.\n\nBut it's still not pacifism when you continue to lead your army, doubly so when it was your side which started the war ([or not :P](https://i.imgur.com/f57fqmI.png)). No one talks about the Pacifist Grant for his quote\n\n&gt; Although a soldier by profession, I have never felt any sort of fondness for war, and I have never advocated it, except as a means of peace.\n\nand no one should talk about Pacifist Lee. They were both Generals in the bloodiest war of American history. They knew what they had to do in order to fulfill their cause.\n\nThis memorization is just an attempt, conscious or not, of reshaping the memory of Robert E. Lee. And considering how much General Lee was a figure head, it also was changing the memory of the Confederacy. \n\n**Fun Bonus Facts**: \n\n- General Lee is a Great General in Civilization 5, General Grant is not. \n\n- General Grant apparently said \"I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do.\"\n\n- The book Killer Angels (turned into film [*Gettysburg, which I reviewed*)](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3uv9fp/gettysburg_1993_stops_caring_once_the_rifles_stop/) said that Robert E. Lee never owned slaves. This is false. He owned slaves and actually went against his father in law's will and prevented them from being freed after his Father in Law's death.\n\n**Civil War Books I Would Recommend**\n\nApostle of Disunion\n\nConfederates in the Attic (modern day look at today's Confederates)\n\nLincoln's Greatest Speech\n\nThe Memory of the Civil War\n\nBecoming Confederates\n",

        "text": "[The offensive post in question.](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4car6t/many_millions_of_muslims_fundamentally/d1gl48z)\n\nThe summary: Luther printing bibles in the common language caused the reformations that today allow Christianity to be compatible with modern western societies.\n\nIt's the same story I was taught in middle school back in the 90s, and I'm sure they're still teaching it today. Because of the printing press, literacy destroyed the Catholic church, and it was amazing, and if you can't read you're literally a heathen piece of shit that will burn in hell for all eternity.\n\nNow, xenophobia and casual bigotry aside, this really comes down to the choice of one word (and as we all should know, word choice is important); that being \"cause\".\n\nA simple look at the timeline:\n\n**October 31, 1517**- Luther begins distributing his *Ninety-Five Theses* around to various bishops and archbishops. No nailing to the Wittenberg castle church, no widespread distribution because of the printing press. The *Ninety-Five Theses* are, of course, printed in Latin. This is generally considered the starting date of the Protestant Reformation. Some would argue it hasn't ended.\n\n**1518**- The *Ninety-Five Theses* is translated from Latin to German by a friend of Luther's, and they begin using Gutenberg's press to copy the German language *Theses* for distribution.\n\n**1518-1521/22**- Unclear as to exactly when, but the castle church at Wittenberg did host some private, non-Catholic, masses on their grounds. By 1521 they began turning them away, and certainly by the end of 1522 they had stopped hosting them all together.\n\n**1521-1522** Luther spends a year in isolation at Wartburg castle translating the New Testament from Latin to German. He completes the New Testament in 1522, and finishes the Old Testament in 1534. \n\nHis New Testament translation did see some widespread adoption, and Gutenberg's press certainly aided reformists in disseminating their message. So, where's the problem? Well, the Protestant Reformation was an issue of theology, it had little to do with the technicality and machinations of worship. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation (by way of justification) is achieved through performing *works and deeds*; avoiding sin, and performing charitable acts. What contemporary reformers posited, by way of attacking the selling of indulgences, and many other corrupt practices of the Catholic Church, is that salvation is achieved by faith and grace alone (*only by grace do we justify, and only by faith are we justified*- *sola fide*, *sola gratia*, the basis of the original Three Solae). *Sola scriptura* (by scripture alone) also shows up in contemporary reformation materials. That is to say, that to be saved, one only has to believe in Jesus and the Resurrection, and that the Bible is the only source of church doctrine, superseding the Pope.\n\nSo, ultimately, the printing press was a ridiculously valuable piece of technology that revolutionized the way we disseminate, communicate, and process information. The book historian in me can't deny that fact. The Protestant reformers used it greatly to their advantage, but did it cause the Protestant Reformation? Absolutely not. The Reformation was rooted in deep theological criticisms of the Catholic Church, and was already well underway several years before the Luther Bible was translated in German and in the hands of reformers.\n\n[EDIT]\n\nNP, derp.",

It says \"Blood (of family) is not spoiled by Water\".\n\nSo where do we get this Blood of the Covenant business? We have two sources. One is R. Richard Pustelniak, a leader of a Jewish Community in Arizona, who wrote a lengthy discourse on Covenants [here] (http://www.bac2torah.com/covenant-Print.htm). Pustelniak does not cite where he got the source of this \"original meaning\". In 2005, Jack Albert's \"Shaggy Dogs and Black Sheep: The Origins of Even More Phrases We Use Every Day\" reiterated the \"true\" origin of this phrase, again, without any scholarly merit.\n\n^1 : Henrickson (1987) \"The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origin\"\n\n^1: ",

        "text": "This is a token Reddit post where a controversial country has had a *single person* do something good, so the author glorifies the entire country. It's full of insane speculation and statements that don't really make sense. Enjoy:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4bvvqn/russian_soldier_surrounded_by_isis_calls_in/d1d2eo9\n\n&gt;The most brilliant scientists, particularly physicists and mathematicians which are arguably the most difficult theoretical sciences, are consistently Russian.\n\nUhh... I'd say they are consistently human... You can point out tons of scientists in any country.\n\n&gt;Lasers were first discovered by Russians.\n\nIf we ignore the semantics here (*Discover* implies lasers are naturally occurring), while Russian scientists did make excellent progress in creating the first lasers, independent research in the US at the same time also developed lasers. Since this is a post detailing why Russia is superior in Scientific research, this doesn't really belong here.\n\n&gt; Space exploration was made possible by a Russian.\n\nI'm not quite sure what he's trying to say here. Just because Russians were the first in space, doesn't mean they made space travel possible. While Russian achievements during the space race were amazing, the US was able to keep pace with them and eventually far and away surpass them.\n\n&gt;Drones were first used in battle by Russians (radio controlled tanks during WW2).\n\nWhile [Teletanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletank) were used by the Soviet Union in WWII, there's very little to be found on their combat effectiveness. Also, the Germans were using [Goliath Tracked Mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_tracked_mine) a bit later, and other countries such as [Britain experimented with the idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_II#Variants)(See *Black Prince*), but didn't actually use it in combat.\n\nWhile certainly an interesting achievement, suggesting the Teletank was heavily influential on the development of modern drones is pretty crazy.\n\n&gt;Yet, they don't capitalize on their scientific prowess.\n\nWhat? How so? Like is he saying the Russians were treated unfairly... Or is he saying the Russians are modest in their scientific pursuits? I'll leave this one for you to decide.\n\n&gt;It's us in the West who later patent technology invented by Russians, and sell that technology at a profit to the Russians.\n\nI think there's some kind of weird typo here, but even still I don't understand what he's trying to say. Is he saying the West has stolen technology from the Russians then patented it? When? There is some technology Russian Scientists may have created first, but then was independently developed elsewhere, but that doesn't really relate here.\n\n----\n\nHe doesn't even mention real amazing solo Russian accomplishments like their advances in [large helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_Mi-26), and [efficient rocket engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK-33). Russia has done some amazing things with very little, but the author of this post seems insistent on trying to steal the West's thunder instead of highlighting the real Russian achievements. ",

([source](http://www.britannica.com/event/Pax-Romana)). However, secondly, Julius Caesar was not alive at this time, as Pax Romana took form during the Roman Empire, not the Roman Republic.\n\n&gt;\"Some 400-500 years later, their free movement into Western Europe led to the fall of the Roman Empire.\"\n\nMany factors led to the fall of the Roman Empire, not just migration.

        "text": "I know there have been tons of MedievalPoC R5s in /r/badhistory, but I haven't really seen two angles dealt with that really undermine their entire effort from a methodological perspective. Their tagline is\n\n&gt;People of Color in European Art History\n\nand that itself has two problems.\n\n**People of Color**, for many of the time periods being studied, is an anachronism. The historical consensus traces the origin of modern racial categories to [the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the 1500s and 1600s, where Africans, Iberians, and Amerindians coexisted in a highly tense and uneasy environment](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/#HisConRac). Noting that the origins of what we today call the white race lie with Mediterranean conquistadors, we can dismiss her argument that [Sicilians](http://irefiordiligi.tumblr.com/post/66450548097/its-pretty-sad-that-someone-who-studies-ancient), for instance, are nonwhite on account of their Moorish ancestry; many conquistadors likely had trace Moorish ancestry too. Her arbitrarily applying the one-drop rule to 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th-century Europe in order to come up with racial classifications is frowned upon by most experts in history. Also problematic is her (I've heard the author referred to as a female in the past) assumption that any depiction of a mixed-phenotype [crowd](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/image/55433504773) implies a multi\"racial\" crowd with both white and \"PoC\" individuals. This ignores the phenotypical diversity found in almost every ethnic group, including Europeans. For instance:\n\nEthnic Danes can look like [this](http://b.bimg.dk/node-images/15/6/2200x/6015730-morten-storm.jpg) or [this](http://www.51allout.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Nicklas-Bendtner.jpg), but they can also look [very British](http://www.mogenscamre.dk/uploads/images/Billeder/Untitled-19.jpg) or even [darker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen,_tidligere_statsminister_Danmark_%281%29.jpg). You see a similar range with [ethnic](http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/Gaitanos.jpg) [Greeks](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7NbMdXPBIAs/T9XR5AxVg-I/AAAAAAAAAbc/2RqU63M9IxE/s1600/kasidiaris-ilias-xrisi-avgi-660_0.jpg) TL;DR: All of those people on that elephant could easily have been Europeans, and from the same ethnic group to boot. Which gets into my next problem:\n\n**European Art History** is not really a good historical source even though MPoC's conclusions on the existence of (what we'd today call) nonwhite people in Europe are not totally wrong. A lot of the scenes she posts show either known African and Asian personas (saints, emperors, etc) or are clearly showing \"[exotic foreigners](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/69561620026/bartholome-zeitblom-adoration-of-the-magi)\"; they say nothing about actual nonwhite presence in Europe beyond the fact that some European artists knew how to paint convincing African and Asian faces. Just looking at one country that is far from either African or Asian settlements (Denmark), I was able to find concrete genetic evidence of [Arab and likely Indo-Iranian settlement](http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/05/ancient-viking-mtdna-from-denmark.html) as well as [Khazar Turkic, related to modern Turks as well as to central and northeast Asian populations, genes throughout Scandinavia](http://tracingthetribe.blogspot.com/2006/10/jewish-vikings-dna-mystery.html). Apparently, two dozen Adoration of the Magi paintings are somehow more conclusive evidence than that; if you don't have paintings to show people but only have dry scientific papers, how can you run a successful tumblr? Oh, and [by the way most of the legwork has been done in terms of creating your coffee-table book](http://www.imageoftheblack.com/).\n\n",

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dAmroKyzGY         \nWe're off to a good start aren't we, eh? English entrepreneurs who set out to America for greater profits were definitely eager to set up a socialist colony to live in self-sustained peace. Thank god they have a transcript so I don't have to listen to that guy's voice again. I'll use Wikipedia for my claims. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia#Rising_fortunes_.281610-1624.29) the article about Jamestown. Double quoted paragraphs are excerpts from wikipedia.\n&gt;When the first settlers arrived—at Jamestown in 1607 then Plymouth in 1620—they were operating under an economic system common to all European nations at that time, known as mercantilism. Under mercantilism businesses, especially in colonies, were operated for the benefit of the state. While governments permitted the companies to make profits, their primary purpose was to advance the national interest of England or Spain or France.        \n           \nOkay, fair enough. The early settlers who came to Jamestown and Plymouth came from England under the [Virginian Company of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Company). They settled on an island that was not inhabited by nearby Virginian Indian tribes (because they thought the place was too shitty), which they saw as a plus. \"The island was swampy, isolated, offered limited space and was plagued by mosquitoes and brackish tidal river water unsuitable for drinking. In addition to the marsh the settlers arrived too late in the year to get crops planted.\" This is what wikipedia says, sounds like the settlers found themselves in a very bad spot, I don't think neither socialism, nor capitalism would help here. So what does Prager University have to say?         \n&gt; The early colonists began their adventure with what they thought was a beautiful idea. They set up a common storehouse of grain from which people were supposed to take what they needed and put back what they could. Lands were also held in common and were worked in common. The settlers owned no land of their own. Though there was no name for this system, it was an ideal socialist commune. And you can probably guess what happened. It began to fall apart almost immediately.       \n         \nOh boy. They do not have any sources at all in their video, this script sounds like it's taken out of a fucking children's book. The colonists who set out to conquer America established a happy commune where everyone took what they wanted and placed what they wanted. Wikipedia makes no mention of this. They are true about one thing, none of the settlers owned land on their own, the land 'belonged' to the London Company which employed them and expected them to return the money at a profit they were given to set out on this journey.\n&gt;&gt;\"Many in the group were gentlemen unused to work, or their manservants, equally unaccustomed to the hard labor demanded by the harsh task of carving out a viable colony. One of these was Robert Hunt, a former vicar of Reculver, England, who \"probably celebrated the first known service of holy communion in what is today the United States of America [at Jamestown, on June 21 1607].\" In a few months, 80% of the party were dead; some of the survivors were deserting to the Indians whose land they had colonized.\"\n             \n         \nKind of ironic how it seems like the actual cause of their first failure was unskilled labour from entrepreneurs Prager U loves to jack off to.        \n&gt;&gt;\"Two-thirds of the settlers died before arriving ships brought supplies and German, Polish and Slovak craftsmen the next year in 1608, who would help to establish the first manufactories in the colony. As a result, glassware became the \"first\" of these American products to be exported to Europe.\"         \n          \nAgain no mention of agricultural socialism. Does not seem like any sort of commune that Prager U described existed, but let's hear what happened next in their beautiful tale.          \n&gt;After about two years, the settlement was reduced to eating shoelaces and rats. Half of them died of starvation. Captain John Smith (of Pocahontas fame) took control of the colony and scrapped the socialist model. Each colonist received his own parcel of land. Private property had come to the New World. “He who won’t work, won’t eat!” Smith told them, citing the Biblical admonition. Well they worked. And they ate. And the colony was saved.           \n          \nGreat, they mention a historical figure so we can atleast try to pin down the time line they're talking about. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong settlement in Jamestown.         \n&gt;&gt;\"The investors of the Virginia Company of London expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay the cost of the voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the Council, Captain John Smith, to deliver a bold and much needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.\"         \n          \nAgain the myth that early colonizers were anyhow socialist seems more and more loony. Looks like they were employed by a company to make profits that they were failing to give and the company was angry. And here appears our savior Smith who stands up to the dirty socialists!!! Oh, no, wait... it seems like he just sent a strong worded letter that told the investors they're being naive thinking the colony can strive without practical laborers who do all the work.         \n          \nI feel like I'm missing something. Where the hell did they pull this story out from, is there some paragraph in wikipedia that I missed. Either way this video was complete bullshit and Prager U is filled with intellectual dishonesty. [Here's](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/holidays/2014/11/thanksgiving_socialism_the_strange_and_persistent_right_wing_myth_that_thanksgiving.html) a Slate article that seems to be better informed that refutes the overall general right wing myth that early colonizers were somehow socialist and the thanksgiving actually celebrates the introduction of capitalism.             \n              \nEDIT: It seems like there's more evidence of some sort of communal working conditions in Plymouth rather than Jamestown as is noted in the Slate article. Although they were not socialist by any means as the workers were employed by a company and all the profit from their labour was supposed to go to it. But Plymouth was merely scouted by Smith and he did not take leadership over there and considering Smith is the central Jesus-like hero in Prager University's fable it would indicate they're talking about Jamestown and their story is absolute bunk. If there are any historical inaccuracies in my post feel free to point them out as I'm no expert, but this video seemed so dead wrong to me I decided to research a bit.\n    ",

But as it turns out, there are older and fouler things than New Atheists in the deep darkness of the thread:\n\n&gt;Uhh I think you mean he brought you out of the dark and into regular trade with the rest of Europe and especially Germany. Pretty much the leader that made Denmark and Norway more than a bunch of raiding clans.\n\n|\n\n&gt;Especially since [Christianity] lead to the greatest prosperity the country had ever seen, uniting a ton of nations at war, and made trade feasible between them establishing them as a dominate trade over the sea.\n\n*Christian Whiggery!*\n\nThere is an element of truth to this, of course, as Christianization tended to go hand in hand with political centralization in Scandinavia. So does this mean that Christianity turned a bunch of warring tribes into strong kingdoms? Not quite: traditionally the unification of Norway to the battle of Battle of Hafrsfjord in the late ninth century, when king Harald Finehair defeated the last bit of organized resistance to his rule. Of course the reality of the creation of the kingdom of Norway must have been rather more complex, but it shows at least a process towards this. The first Christian king, by contrast, was Haakon the Good, who was raised in England before becoming king in 934. His attempts at spreading the religion, if the *Heimskringla* is to be believed, were pretty half hearted and not really succesful. It wasn't until Olaf Tryggvason, king from 995-1000, that there was any real attempt at mass conversion.\n\nDenmark is a bit more complicated, not the least because we have a bit more information on the non-royal conversions, such as St. Ansgar's missions in the ninth century. But again there is the same pattern in which the process of unification (traditionally attributed to Gorm the Old) occurred before the royal patronage of Christianity (attributed to his son, Harald Bluetooth).\n\nSweden's early history is a bit more mythical than Denmark and Norway's, but at the very least Erik the Victorious, the first somewhat reliable king of Sweden, was not Christian. And regardless, Adam of Bremen, writing in the 1070s, describes (however unreliably) Uppsala as an active pagan ritual site, so it seems that the new religion took a while to stick there.\n\nOf course this is all looking at history from the wrong direction, as if there were primordial Denmarks and Norways and Swedens that the unifying kings made whole. There is quite a bit to critique in this teleological proto-nationalism, but the Medieval stories of the unifications at least show that there was the consolidation of power and the rise of nascent states well before the official introductions of Christianity. So what is the takeaway? Rather than Christianization being a neccesary ingredient for centralization, the case was more the reverse. Christianity attained political dominance in Scandinavia precisely because it was useful to the centralizing kingdoms which already existed.\n\nThe rest of the thread is pretty awful with statements like this:\n\n&gt;Look at the results of any country becoming majority Christian throughout history and please tell me what you find. Oh you know the ONLY Superpower in the world today happens to have become that while being majority Judeo-Christian? Your blind hatred of Christianity does not change the facts that it is strongly correlated with economic, cultural and libertarian success.\n\nAnd some weird wrangling over the definition of the word \"pagan\" and far more instances of the words \"neckbeard\" and \"euphoric\" than I thought was strictly neccesary. It's really just the Lindisfarne of Reddit threads.\n\nThe main source is Gwyn Jones' really wonderful *History of the Vikings* and the the *Vikings* Great Courses lecture series. There is a *lot* of scholarly contestation of this period and the twin processes of state formation and Christianization and I am trying to avoid the controversial bits as much as possible.",

        "text": "This badhistory is 2.5 years old, but I still get furious when I think about it, so I decided to post it.\n\nOnce upon a time, [a Tumblr user created a graphic](http://beggars-opera.tumblr.com/post/62763822913/ive-seen-a-few-fashion-posts-trying-to-expand-the) to help people understand what sorts of dresses belong to different Western/British historical periods - basically, to get people to stop calling 18th or 20th century images \"Victorian\". It's quite good for that - the images are cropped to show women in ordinary styles of dress^(1) from head to below the hip, and each row shows examples from the beginning, middle, and end of the era.^(2) It got some traction, which, I believe, is how it came to the attention of the controversial MedievalPoC.\n\n1. Apart from the first in \"Georgian\", which is a stage costume\n\n2. Apart from the first and second(?) in \"Elizabethan\", which are not British and confuse the matter\n\nMPoC then created [her own version](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/91644073158/beggars-opera-ive-seen-a-few-fashion-posts) of the graphic, which was intended as a convincing critique. Unfortunately, nearly all of her choices were bad. Let's start with her opening paragraph:\n\n&gt;And people wonder WHY I complain about History/Art History periodization. Note how much overlap there is to the above “eras”, and how many exceptions and extensions there are to these categories.\n\nThere is room to complain about periodization - the recent AH [Monday Methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4aenux/monday_methodshow_does_periodization_affect_our/?ref=search_posts) on periodization certainly describes its downsides - but this is the tamest and most accurate version of periodization that exists: the kind based on the name of a ruler or dynasty, which implies no value judgement or description. The fact that sometimes people don't include \"Elizabethan\" under \"Tudor\", or extend \"Edwardian\" out to encompass WWI, doesn't detract from how useful it can be for someone to describe a portrait as \"Stuart\" even if they can't narrow it down more than that. Note that \"how many\" exceptions and extensions there are = the two I just mentioned. That's all.\n\n&gt; the [\"Tudor\" pictures](http://33.media.tumblr.com/04834ca565cf545667118d20f319de32/tumblr_inline_n8njstsnZI1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nThese are simply and blatantly not Tudor images. I knew this visually, but because MPoC eventually [posted her sources](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/92236144722/people-have-been-asking-for-info-on-the-images), it became even clearer. The first is from *Portrait of the Princess of Zanzibar and her attendant, Scotland*, originally painted in the 17th century but \"[copied or elaborated on](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12227331.Scots_adventurer_and_the_Pocahontas_of_Zanzibar/)\" in 1731 by Walter Friel. The second is *Portrait of an African Slave Woman*, attributed to Annibale Carracci, from the 1580s - Elizabethan by the standards of the categories being used, though not British and therefore not *really* Elizabethan or Tudor anyway. The third is a scene from a [gorgeous illuminated manuscript](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/74076913133/ma%C3%AEtre-de-lu%C3%A7on-terence-collection-of-comedies) of 1412. I will at least give MPoC credit here for cropping the images to be relatively useful for the purpose of showing what dress from these periods looked like, but these have nothing to do with the reigns of the Tudors. She knew when these images were from - nearly all of the source links go to her own Tumblr - and chose to mislead with them. Bear that in mind going forward.\n\n&gt; the [\"Elizabethan\" pictures](http://38.media.tumblr.com/860179d95d7824906029e55b84b7e875/tumblr_inline_n8njtcJFBp1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nHere's where things take a turn for the differently worse. The first image here is from *The Miracle of Saint Turibio*, 1726 (very much not Elizabethan), and the second is *The Agrippine Sybil*, by Abraham Janssens, ca. 1575 (which is technically Elizabethan in timescale if not geography, so points there) - and these are both complete, fanciful costumes. Costumes are irrelevant to the purpose of the original graphic, which was to show a sequence of dress to help amateur fans of fashion history learn to date images. Neither image is at all helpful. The third is a portrait of a Brazilian woman, 1645, which is *once again* not Elizabethan, not European dress, not cropped to show the clothing, and not at all helpful.\n\n&gt; the [\"Stuart\" pictures](http://33.media.tumblr.com/04bca15b7295c4eeb3616b12be704c79/tumblr_inline_n8nk7d6kWt1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nThe first here is from a tapestry showing *the Marriage of Theagenes and Charicleia* (Flemish/French, ca. 1620); the second is from a Nattier [portrait of *Mademoiselle de Clermont en Sultane*](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/72339282685/jean-marc-nattier-mademoiselle-de-clermont-en) (1733); the third is a Rubens study. So we have two out of three in the actual period, which is good, but 1733 is of course in no way Stuart. However, we once again have images showing draped costumes rather than fashionable dress (the original, if you check the link above, is just chock-full of exoticism), and an image cropped not to show any clothing.\n\n&gt; the [Georgian pictures](http://33.media.tumblr.com/3cd8c9c364da67a2cf5b45ccdfd1d525/tumblr_inline_n8nklmevMc1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nThe first here is *Allegory of Music* (Fieravino Francesco, 1670s); the second the 1767 portrait of \"Annushka\", a Kalmyk serf; the third a rather famous portrait of Dido Elizabeth Belle with her cousin, 1779. Again, two out of three in the period, and again ... two costumes. Annushka is the only one not in a costume, but as her dress fairly well represents 18th century silhouettes, there is at least some success here.\n\n&gt; the [\"Regency\" pictures](http://31.media.tumblr.com/d386632195e3006ee3c7539d1d643697/tumblr_inline_n8nl8varCu1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nThe first is a portrait of an unknown woman, and is dated ca. 1800 by MPoC - elsewhere, it's given as \"late 18th century\", so who knows. There's not enough clothing visible to date, or to be useful as a reference. The second is *Portrait of a Young Black Woman*, Simon Willem Maris, 1890s according to MPoC's tumblr page for the painting: *well* out of the Regency period, and not in fashionable clothing to boot. The third is [not dated](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-d568-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) by the NYPL, but is from a book of lithographs of Peruvian people and scenes from the mid-19th century. So nothing here is quite right for the period, and again, nothing here is actually useful for any kind of reference for dating fashionable dress.\n\n&gt; the [Victorian pictures](http://31.media.tumblr.com/5b81df6ed4732ab41a8205e0135797c4/tumblr_inline_n8nll0e9ZO1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nI will give some more credit where credit is due: the first one here, from *Their Pride* (Thomas Hovenden, ca. 1870), is both from the Victorian era and a relatively useful dress reference image. Then we go to a portrait by Anton Ažbe (1895) and a portrait of Fanny Eaton (1861). These are also both Victorian - good job, all three from the period! - but fall into the trap of being portraits that focus on conveying a message through the face of the sitter, representing clothing in only a very slight manner, and are therefore, once again, not useful as references, which was the entire point of the original graphic.\n\n&gt; the [Edwardian pictures](http://33.media.tumblr.com/4468429529119ce449b7d86077c5137f/tumblr_inline_n8nm8b97eO1rpr1t4.jpg)\n\nMore credit: the first and last images are Edwardian, and represent, respectively, earlier and later in the period. The second, however, despite being from 1907 (*Eva Green*, by Robert Henri), unfortunately gives very little information about dress.\n\nAnd she ends with:\n\n&gt; Because you wouldn’t want to be historically inaccurate.\n\nWhich is rather ironic, given the massive amount of inaccuracy deliberately involved in this project. It is neither historically accurate *nor* a useful reference for fashion history n00bs trying to figure out how to date old artwork.\n\n(N.B. Beggars-opera is very tired of getting notifications about anything to do with this post, so please treat Tumblr links as non-participatory. Thank you!)",

        "text": "**Reminder that Mandela was also a terrorist leader who brutally murdered families -women and children included- to get the whites out of SA or worse**\n\n\nSo i found this gem of badhistory within a thread on AskReddit today and felt duty bound to post this here, as usual with my posts I'm no expert historian but i am a history undergrad with enough sense to do research when i think something is likely wrong. Ill stick to the particulars of this statement though, in regards to the idea that he intentionally massacred  white civilians in order to drive white people from the country.\n\n\nThe main problem with this statement is there is no evidence of that, Mandela believed in an idea of controlled violence in order to force the SA government to the negotiating table, the first phase of this being attacks on military infrastructure, while many including Mandela argued that these attacks would not ultimately be enough, believing that eventually violence would be their last resort, no evidence has been found to suggest that these bombing actions at least in Mandela's mind were designed to drive the whites out of SA. To quote Joe Slovo a commander of the African National Congresses military wing:\n\n\n**No one believed that the tactic of sabotage could, on its own, lead to the collapse of the racist state. It would be the first phase of 'controlled violence' designed to serve a number of purposes. It would be a graphic pointer to the need for carefully planned action rather than spontaneous or terrorist acts of retaliation which were already in evidence ”¦ And it would demonstrate that the responsibility for the slide towards bloody civil war lay squarely with the regime**\n\n\nTo also quote from his wikipedia article:\n\n\n**Mandela stated that they chose sabotage not only because it was the least harmful action, but also \"because it did not involve loss of life [and] it offered the best hope for reconciliation among the races afterward.\" He noted that \"strict instructions were given to members of MK that we would countenance no loss of life\", but should these tactics fail, MK would resort to \"guerilla warfare and terrorism**\n\n\nMandela while not outright opposed to the concept of using terrorism to force the apartheid government to the negotiating table, clearly wished to avoid such recourse in order to allow for reconciliation after the SA government had ended apartheid, but felt that if there was no other choice then it would be what the ANC must resort to. \n\nDespite the actions of the ANC in the early 1960s i think the best example of Mandela clearly showing he had no intention of driving whites out of SA came after his release from prison and election as president. If it were the case that Mandela intended his own genocide against the minority white population when he came to power he wouldn't have for instance, held up the nearly all white rugby team the springboks as a symbol for all South Africans to be proud of as president of SA, he wouldn't have shared a Nobel peace prize with the former white president of South Africa F.W. de Klerk, and he would not have invited one of his former white wardens to his presidential inauguration.\n\nIs Mandela perfect, i would argue not, nor would i say he intended genocide against white South Africans, but felt that violence as a form of resistance may become his only option, whether his use of terror was justified is not the point of the piece, but rather a discussion of its use was used to demonstrate his reasoning behind his use of terror. Mandela left a legacy of attempted reconciliation and a South Africa far better off than under the repression of Apartheid, whatever his failings i think Ultimately Nelson Mandela deserves his peace prize, and does not deserve to be slandered in an AskReddit thread. \n\nSources:\nhttp://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/umkhonto-wesizwe-mk\n\nhttps://www.nelsonmandela.org/content/page/biography\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/12/06/9-questions-about-nelson-mandela-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask/\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/world/africa/nelson-mandela_obit.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela#MK.2C_the_SACP.2C_and_African_tour:_1961.E2.80.9362\n\n\nEdit: In the same thread i saw someone claim that Mandela's actions could not be defended because they were akin to Nazi level atrocities, Godwin's law everyone.\n\nEdit 2: i fear ive confused some people as to whether im arguing that Mandelas actions did not equate to terrorism or that he did not intend to drive whites out of SA, it was the latter point i was arguing for and ill be editing the post a little to more directly get to that point",

        "text": "As an amateur researcher on Nanking for the past few years my views on what happened have changed considerably. Rather unsurprisingly the first book I read on the events which occurred in Nanking was The *Rape of Nanking* by Iris Chang. Evidently, soon after I learned the book was full of inaccuracies and blatant fabrications such as claiming the victims for the atrocities numbered around “350,000”. Since then I have immersed myself in knowledge on the incident, purchasing material from all sides of the debate. One recent purchase was Tanaka Masaaki's *What Really Happened in Nanking: The Refutation of a Common Myth*. While it can be said Chang's book is on one side of the spectrum of inaccuracies, exaggerations and fabrications, Tanaka's book is on the other. Tanaka is a proponent of the *Illusion school*, a group of researchers on Nanking who, while not denying atrocities occurred, claim they have been mostly fabricated. It should be noted that the overwhelmingly vast majority of Japanese historians do not align themselves with this group. In fact, there are very few professional historians in this group. Most fall into the *centrist school*, scholars who openly acknowledge there were large scale atrocities but estimate the victims to be in the tens of thousands, and the *massacre school* which estimates victims to be over one hundred thousand. A good overview of the debate for anyone interested can be found [here] (http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html). . Regardless, what is generally agreed upon is that several weeks into the occupation of Nanking large numbers of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war were killed. I'm going to attempt to tackle this book chapter by chapter by comparing it to the more credible works of *centrist* and *great* massacre historians.\n\nIn the introduction Tanaka rightfully critiques Chang's seriously flawed *The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II*, arguing (quite correctly) the nature of the Holocaust in Europe differed quite substantially from what happened in Nanking. He then criticizes the Japanese government for not having a backbone and not countering Chang's “lies, hyperbole and propaganda”. Again, while his critique of Chang is somewhat correct I don't think it's the state's job to carry out the work of historians. Tanaka goes onto defend General Iwane Matsui, the commander-in-chief of the Central China Area Army and who was (in my opinion wrongly) ultimately held responsible for the massacres that occurred during and after the battle of Nanking, citing his order that \n\n\n&gt;“The entrance of the Imperial Army into the capital of a foreign nation is a historic event. The attention of the world will be focused on you. You are to observe military regulations to the letter, to set an example for the future” (Tanaka, *What Really Happened in Nanking*, 2000, pp 3). \n\nEvidently, this order went unheard. Tanaka emphasizes the humanitarian side of Gen. Iwane Matsui by highlighting the shrine and memorial tablet he had dedicated to KMT soldiers killed in action. Through this, Tanaka is attempting to create an image of a benevolent army which valued the life of its Chinese enemy. As noted earlier, this view is not widely held among Japanese historians, and as we will see for good reason.\n\n**Chapter 1: Defining “Massacre”**\n\nTanaka attempts to give his own definition of a massacre, defining it as \n\n\n&gt;“The unlawful, premeditated, methodical killing of large numbers of innocent people” (Ibid, pp 7). \n\nBelieving that nothing out of a combat situation occurred in Nanking, he asks then why the battle of Iwo Jima is not referred to as the “Iwo Jima Massacre” when more soldiers allegedly died there than in Nanking. There are two main issues with this. The most obvious one is that there were no mass executions of prisoners of war or captured plainclothes soldiers on Iwo Jima (the latter which Tanaka does not deny the occurrence of in Nanking). Secondly, his claim that more people were killed in Iwo Jima than in Nanking does not stand up to scrutiny when compared to the sources of the time. For instance, the Japanese Army on the 29th of December, 1937, announced 84,000 Chinese soldiers had been killed in Nanking (Masahiro Yamamoto, *Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity*, 2000, pp. 88). Tanaka disregards this estimate later on in the book, calling it an exaggeration. However, the Japanese 65th Regiment's battle report cited a similar figure of 58,774 (ibid). On the lower end, we have New York Times correspondent F. Tillman Durdin who estimated 33,000 Chinese had been killed, 20,000 of which had been executed (ibid). It should be noted these estimates do not include Japanese war dead which undoubtedly was in the several thousands. Nonetheless, it can be safely assumed there were drastic differences between the battle of Iwo Jima and the Fall of Nanking both in terms of what happened in the number of fatalities.\n\nTanaka uses the classifications system of Kaikosha researcher Unemoto Masami to group the victims. They are: “Combat Casualties” - battle deaths, “Combat-related casualties” - collateral damage, and “Unlawful acts” - the mass murder of civilians and prisoners of war. As I said earlier, Tanaka does not deny mass executions of plainclothes soldiers took place. In fact he classifies them as “Combat Casualties”, as in his eyes they were entirely legal. Such an interpretation is a massive distortion of international law. Japanese historian Kitamura Minoru after evaluating the illusionist school's arguments on this matter concluded that it was necessary for a court martial to be undertaken for the executions to be legal. These “mass murders” as Kitamura put it were of a continuous and large scale nature and went against the humanitarian aspect of the Hague Convention. (Kitamura, *The Politics of Nanjing*, 2007, pp. 86-87)\n\nSurprisingly, Tanaka classes “individual soldiers who surrendered and were later killed” under “Combat-related”, even though “individual soldiers who were incarcerated and subsequently executed” are classed under “Unlawful”. It goes without saying that the execution of any soldier who has surrendered contradicts International Law at the time. I refer to Article 23 of the Hague convention which states it is forbidden [“To kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down his arms, or having no longer means of defence, has surrendered at discretion”] (http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp).\n\nThis distorted classification system is an attempt to arrive at the lowest possible figure for atrocity victims, and it's unsurprising Unemoto arrived at the figure of 3,000-6,000. This contrasts with some Japanese historians such as Tomio Hora and Akira Fujiwara, both of whom estimate 200,000 deaths, who include all battlefield deaths. Regardless, the political and revisionist slant Tanaka adheres to demands that he uses these gross distortions, for if he doesn't it confirms large scale atrocities did occur.\n\n**Chapter 2 Population of Nanking 1937**\n\nChapter 2 discusses the pre-occupation population of Nanking which Tanaka puts between 160,000 and 250,000. This is not necessarily incorrect, and I see no point in attempting to refute this. To his credit, he does cite relevant primary sources, such as the Smythe Survey, and John Rabe's letter to the Japanese embassy where he estimated “250,000-300,000” civilians were in the city and its immediate outskirts. Some Japanese historians such as Kasahara Tokushi include the whole Nanking Safety Administrative District (NSAD) to come to a figure of 1.5 million people (Kasahara Tokushi in *“Massacres Outside Nanking City,” in The Nanking Atrocity*, 1937-38: Complicating the Picture, ed. Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi). However, this area includes six counties, making it about 8,000sq km large. It would be inappropriate and irrelevant in my opinion to change the geographical boundaries of the massacre to counter Tanaka's argument.\n\n**Chapter 3 Nanking's Population Swells as Residents Return**\n\nChapter 3 discusses the rise in population of Nanking. Again, I see no reason to refute this as this is not necessarily incorrect. It is already known that the when order was eventually brought back in February 1938 people in Nanking refugees began to return to their homes.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Mountain’s of Dead Bodies that No One Saw**\n\nPart of Tanaka’s method of disproving there were no large scale atrocities in Nanking is that he selectively chooses witnesses who saw nothing, and neglects accounts which reaffirm atrocities occurred. For instance, Sakamoto Chikashi, commander of the 2nd battalion, 23rd infantry regiment stated: \n\n&gt;“We didn’t inspect every single home, but other than the restaurant owner, we saw no civilians, no enemy soldiers, no dead bodies. Nor did we hear any significant gunfire.” (Tanaka, 2000, pp. 22)\n\n10th army staff officer Tanida Isamu witnessed something similar:\n\n&gt;“On the morning of December 14, Headquarter personnel entered Nanking. In the afternoon, we established a base in a bank near a building near Nanking Road. By that time, the city was quiet. During the whole time I was stationed there I heard no gunfire whatsoever. That same day, I made a tour of Nanking, and took photographs. I did see some corpses, but only a few. The city was peaceful.” (Ibid, pp. 25)\n\nWhile I see no reason to question the accounts of these soldiers, it does give the reader a misconstrued picture of what happened in Nanking, similar to the extreme position of hundreds of thousands of civilians being butchered in the city walls. For instance, in a possibly exaggerated account, Asahi Shimbun reporter Moriyama Yoshio claimed that after Nanking had fallen \n\n\n&gt;“The Japanese troops herded thirty thousand Chinese, most of them old people, women and children, into the area surrounded by the city walls. After that, I’m told that they threw hand grenades down on them and shot them with machine guns from the top of the walls, killing everyone. The area within the walls was literally a mountain of corpses at the time, and it is said that the sea of blood was enough to soak one’s boots” (Honda Katsuichi, *The Nanjing Massacre: A Japanese Journalist Confronts Japan's National Shame*, 1999, pp.)\n\nIn a slightly more realistic tone, Asahi Shimbun reporter Imai Masataki witnessed the execution of dozens of Chinese civilians, and it’s implied the whole group numbering around 400-500 was killed in this way: \n\n\n&gt;“Four or five hundred Chinese men squatted there, practically filling the whole lot. One side of the lost was made up of half destroyed, blackened brick wall. Six Chinese at a time stood and faced that wall. From twenty or thirty paces away, Japanese soldiers fired their rifles all at once into the backs of these men. Running to the fallen men, they then administered the death blow with a single bayonet thrust to the back. Their last cries rang out across the hillside. Then six more stood up.” (Ibid)\n\nAnother similar account by a Japanese reporter, Adachi Kazuo, emerged from Nanking:\n\n\n&gt;“Near the Asahi Shimbun branch office was an open space where burned rubble had been cleared away. In the open space was a long line of Chinese standing under the watchful eyes of Japanese troops. Almost all of the Chinese men who stayed in Nanjing had been rounded up and branded “plain-clothes soldiers”. We managed to save one of them by testifying that he had worked for us in the days before the war. After that, the Asahi office was besieged by women and children begging us to help, but we did not have it within our power to save any others. The “plain-clothes soldiers” were shot one by one, right in front of their weeping and screaming wives and children.” (Ibid)\n\nWhat can we make from these seemingly contradictory accounts? Perhaps it is that while the mass killings of civilians may be of a different scale and nature than commonly perceived, they undoubtedly did happen. With regard to these illegal killings Tanaka alleges: \n\n\n&gt;“Not one of the tens of thousands of soldiers and some 150 newspaper correspondents and photographers who followed them into Nanking ever saw anything of the sort.”\n\nOf all the claims Tanaka makes in the book this is undoubtedly one of the most absurd. The Kaikosha, a fraternity organization for former officers of the Japanese army, attempted to refute the allegations that the Imperial Japanese Army massacred hundreds of thousands of civilians in the city of Nanking by asking members to recount their experiences in Nanking. What they did not expect to receive however, were accounts of officers who either witnessed or took part in atrocities. What is ironic about this is that Tanaka was one of the interviewers in this exact study. In 1985, in the last issue of the study the chief editor even issued a profound apology:\n\n\n&gt;“To repeat: 3,000-6,000 is a terrible figure; how much more so is 13,000. When we began compiling our history, we were prepared to accept Japan was not innocent. Nevertheless, we can only reflect upon such huge numbers with deep sadness. No matter what the conditions of battle were, and not matter how much that affected the hearts of the men, such large scale illegal killings cannot be justified. As someone affiliated with the former Japanese Army, I can only apologize deeply to the Chinese people. I am truly sorry. We did horrible things to you.” (Yamamoto, 2000, pp 52)\n\nSoon after, the Kaikosha published a semi-official history based on interviews with members and concluded 15,760 civilians and 16,000 prisoners of war had been executed by the Japanese. While these figures are below the “orthodox” estimates of hundreds of thousands, they no doubt reaffirm atrocities on a large scale occurred. By arguing against those who believe mass executions did take place, he is inadvertently arguing against the army which perpetrated these atrocities.\n\n**Chapter 5: International Committee’s Statistics on Crimes Attributed to Japanese Military Personnel** \n\nIn this chapter Tanaka tries to discount the 516 cases of Japanese misconduct the International Committee, the organization which reputedly sheltered 200,000 Chinese civilians during the atrocities, reported. He does provide legitimate criticism of these reported cases, such as many being based on hearsay. Additionally, many of these cases were not of a violent nature, such as Japanese troops going into a house and knocking a glass of milk over. However, these cases did disturb some Japanese politicians, such as the head of the East Asian Bureau of the Foreign Ministry Ishi Itaro:\n\n\n&gt;“We received letters from Shanghai detailing unspeakable acts of violence, including lootings and rapes, committed in Nanking by our soldiers. The perpetrators of these crimes have disgraced the Imperial Army and betrayed the Japanese people. This is a matter with grave social implications… How could the men fighting in the name of our emperor behave in such a way? From that time on, I referred to those incidents as the “Nanking atrocities.” (Tanaka, pp. 30)\n\nTanaka resorts to personal attacks to counter the alleged insincerity of Ishi’s statement by pointing out his “feelings of hostility towards his own nation”. Part of Tanaka’s evidence to back up this claim is that whenever Ishi wrote about Japanese-Sino relations he always put “China” first. Additionally, he alleges Ishi was not impressed when he received an award from Emperor Hirohito, but expressed delight when China gave him a similar one. To Tanaka, this is a legitimate flaw on Ishi’s objectivity, but to others this is as an infantile attack on character.\n\nThis is what I have so far. I have exams at the start of May so when I get those out of the way I'll get back to this.\n\nCheers for reading.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n",

It's our baby and we can give it any nickname we like too.\n\n&gt;Oh sure, St. Patrick did his best work in Ireland and oh sure there was (probably) some form of Feast of St Patrick on the church calendar way back before America was even imagined, but nobody “celebrated” it. They marked the day with Mass, sweets for the children, but otherwise quiet contemplation. They have only been “celebrating” St Patrick's Day in Ireland for 25 years. Okay they might have had parades before that, but those were just for children too.\n\nR5: Utter blarney. While the first St. Patrick's Day parade *was* held in the US, that was back in [1752](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-st-patricks-day-parade), although the celebration of the holiday as a major feast and patriotic day was already a tradition at the time. [St. Patrick's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick's_Day#Ireland) first became a feast day in Irish Catholicism around 1600, and became a national holiday in 1903, which is about 80 years more than the \"25 years\" that IrishCentral claims. The first state-sanctioned parade happened in 1931, although many parades before then (especially 1916) were highly politicized. The history above is roughly correct, though, for another American popular holiday: Halloween. In its current form, it is largely a product of [American influence](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/rise-of-halloween-culture-sees-backlash-in-germany-a-931005.html) and saw a major spurt of popularity in 1991, exactly matching IrishCentral's 25-year timeline.\n\nTL;DR: I wonder if IrishCentral mistook St. Patrick's Day for Halloween; the history is wildly wrong for SPD but perfect for Halloween.",
