        "text": "Just wondering what things, big and small, that you all do to save on time. I know there are some circumstances where this has a big impact financially (e.g. a car=less time on travel planning and prep), but sometimes depending on lifestyles, other options work better (e.g. no car = sleep/study time on transit). I sometimes find myself doing little things like making a point to clear the sink while a meal is in the microwave, or aiming to unpack the dishwasher by the time the water boils for something as a little challenge to maximize my time on chores. I don't/didn't necessarily think of it as a form of frugality before, but it occurred to me today that this members of this sub might do the same thing. Does anyone have thoughts on this?",

It'll tell you the manufactured date at a minimum and the unit's specs/average list price if available. Maybe it'll help some people decide if they should pay for a repair or just replace the unit.\n\nIt does the usual date/month decoding from the serial number but also does a search on the manufacturer in order to narrow down the date further in the case of GE/LG/Frigidaire and others that don't put the exact year in the serial number. As a last resort it searches the entire web for data on the model and approximates the manufacturing date.\n\nAnyway, I decided to just put it on the web for everyone to use, hope it helps some people. Feedback is appreciated as well.",

Put the beans in a bowl and fill it with water, put the bowl in the fridge. \n\n2. Toss everything except for the ham and beans into the pressure cooker and cover with water. \n\n3. Slow cook overnight on medium while beans are soaking. \n\n4. Blend the stew until chunk free. \n\n5. Put everything into the pressure cooker (or slow cooker), add water to cover if needed, and pressure cook for 30 minutes at high pressure (~7 hours on high for slow cooker) or until beans are soft and ham is fork tender. \n\n6. Remove lid and heat on high to boil off extra water stirring occasionally until desired thickness. The beans will absorb more water and thicken the stew further as it sits and cools so you may want to undershoot if you plan on leftovers. \n\n7. Served alone or made better by white rice and bread.\n\nAdjust the cayenne and smoked pepper amounts to taste. It's also very tweak and modify, just some of my experiments:\n- add hotter spices\n- saute the vegetables  \n- make it sweeter by adding carrots  \n- use chicken/sausage/roast beef/whatever instead of ham  \n- vegan with imitation broth or vegetable stock \n- etc",

But I know there is a gurdwara (Sikh) near me I could go to almost daily and they will have meals. I'm lucky that my apartment is very well situated but a lot of these places are on or near bus lines.\n\nI am not religious by any means, but I do l love and support that aspect of different communities doing what is right. There is at least 1 church near me that I know I could turn to if I lost the roof over my head, just based on some word of mouth and the sign outside they change weekly with different thought-provoking messages.\n\nAt the end of the day, you should do what you are comfortable with. I have a friend who would never set foot in a Christian church again for personal reasons. I wouldn't expect him to put himself through any kind of discomfort (or a relapse tbh). But I feel like he could benefit from other places if they are willing to help. \n\nYou deserve help too.",

        "text": " Hi Frugals,\n\nI asked mods for permission before posting because this is about a specific customer rewards program and I don’t work for them. I just want to tell you about a strategy to save LOTS of money. I hope this is useful to you in this time of such high inflation.  \n\nBefore I get into it, this is a post for Canadians. The program is only available in Canada (as far as I know). It’s called PC Optimum and it covers  [all these stores](https://lclcallcenters.my.site.com/PCoptimumsupport/s/article/Which-stores-are-participating-in-PC-Optimum-Points-Days?language=en_US).  Sorry to Americans :( I think there are a lot of Canadians on this sub... \n\nI also want to state that I only use this at the grocery store \"Maxi\" which is in Quebec. However, the program covers the whole of Canada. My mother uses the same strategy at No Frills in Ontario. I sometimes use it at Esso but I rarely use my car so don’t buy a lot of gas. There is also Shoppers Drugmart/Pharmaprix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI earned just over 450$ of real grocery dollars (in the form of points) from the summer of 2020 to today with this program. It’s a lot of work (and it took a lot of work for me to fine-tune the strategy!), but that’s also a lot of money! (It would have been more had I understood this system from the start.)\n\nWhat you need to make it work at the level I’m at now:\n\n\\- A family, because you need to be able to make large 200$ single transactions. If you have a large household, great. You'll have less work to do.\n\n\\- A freezer, because you need to be able to buy multiples of items that freeze well and can be used up within two months, like bread (unless you have a larger family and can reach easily buy 200$ worth of groceries without having to freeze stuff!)\n\n\\- The meticulous personality of a frugal grocery shopper. This is really the key. If you're already someone who hunts grocery deals, scans multiple grocery flyers every week, you can easily get where I got with this program.\n\nAlso, let's be clear: this is a company rewards program. They want you to be their client and they’ve made a client out of me because I do most of my grocery purchases with them now. However, you can be smart about what to buy and how to buy it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere’s the system in 6 steps:\n\n**1- Get the card.** If you are not already a PC Optimum member, there are often promotions for new members, so there’s a bunch of points to get you started. When I got the card, I think there was a 10 000 points promotion, so 10$. 1000 points = 1$. (Beware: this is not the same as the promotion for a *PC credit card*. I’ve seen up to 100 000 points promotions for that card. Don’t fall for it - or any promotions on credit, ever.)\n\n**2- Make some small purchases with your new card.** Say, 15-20$ worth. I can be stuff from the flyer. Or stuff you need that you wouldn’t get for cheaper elsewhere. You don't want to get \"had\" by the program, so cross-checking prices is important throughout this strategy (see point 4). But **let the program get to know you** by always scanning the card for each of these small purchases. This also tells the program it *could* get you to buy more because you're not buying a lot.\n\n**3- Watch your email** (you've associated it to your card). If you’ve scanned the card for small purchases, the program will try to find a way to get you to spend more. Then you’ll get a \"buy 200$ of groceries and earn 20 000 points\" promotion by email. The email will come, trust me, but it will probably take a few weeks. **The strategy is based on this recurring offer.** It will keep coming over the months. Sometimes it takes three weeks, sometimes 2 months . Keep your eyes open. This is how I’ve earned the majority of my points. 20 000 points = 20$. 20$ can grow into hundreds over time.\n\n4**- Keep a list of things you could buy but don’t** ***need*** **to buy right away**. This is essential to \"fill in\" an order to reach the 200$ you need to get the points. Look through your cupboards and fridge. Are you going to run out of ketchup in a month or two? Put it on the list. Peanut butter? Put it on the list. Anything with a long shelf life or freeze well – **put it on the list**. You need to accumulate enough items to make a 200$ purchase at some point (if you have a larger household, this might be easier for you). A lot of the things on your list may be at regular price when you finally have enough, so step 5 is important.\n\n(Sometimes there's a “buy 150$ for 20 000 points” promotion. This one comes out rarely, I think I've seen it twice a year. Jump on it! If you can make it a 300$ grocery, you’ll accumulate 40 000 points! 40$! I’ve never been able to make that happen but one day perhaps 😉 When the kid turns into ogre teen...)\n\n5- **Cross-check everything if it’s not on sale**. Don’t put it on the list if the regular price is lower at another grocery chain. If the item is only a 10-cent difference, use your own judgement. Do you want to drive or walk for that extra few cents savings? That’s actually one way the rewards program makes a long-term client out of you, like it has with me. \"The customer is willing to buy Heinz with us a 3.79 rather than 3.69 at the other guy – I’m making the profit on selling the Heinz instead of the other guy\"). I’m fine with that.\n\n**6- check out your PC account “offers” frequently.** The program, getting to \"know\" you better and better, starts sending offers for brand items you already buy (and for a lot of stuff you don’t buy but it hopes you'll buy). I only buy Breyers ice-cream for example. I regularly get a “200 points per 2$ of Breyers” offer. That doesn’t sound like a lot but it adds up, especially if you buy two ice-cream containers (which I do… when they’re on sale :)). Another offer I get all the time is for a specific brand of bread I buy. 400 points per two loaves. This is where you see how having a freezer is essential to get the program working at the 100$-level. Rather than just the two loaves, I’ll buy 8 (bread keeps well in the freezer and we go through a lot of bread). I’ve just earned an extra 2 400 points! And so on, and so on. The largest amount of points I’ve ever earned in a single purchase, combined with the 200-dollars-offer, is 38 000 points. 38$ of money toward groceries! It’s crazy. So far, I’ve made two 180$ free groceries and have 100 000 points left in the bank!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few other things I do (but I got the frugal gene from my mom and this is borderline OCD so you might not be able or want to get so involved...):\n\n\\- I try to use the 20 000 points offer when the flyer has something at a good discount that I can buy a lot of. I make a ton of tomato sauce. Sometime cans of tomatoes are 1.25$ in the flyer. These things have a year shelf life. I buy 10-15 (they're a drag to carry back to the car though!). Cans of tomatoes are often on my \"I’ll eventually need\" list (point 4). If I don’t have the offer 20K points offer, I’ll still buy the multiple cans though, because I need them and that’s around 10-15$ of savings. Toilet paper goes on sale too, and \"fills in\" the order more quickly. If the sale coincides with the 20K offer, I buy 4-5 packs. Hey, you never stop going through toilet paper.\n\n\\- Next week's flyer usually comes out a day or two before the end of the previous one. Say I'm out of X product and it wasn't on sale this week, I'll check out the new flyer as soon as it's out to see if it's on sale next week. If it is, I'll wait to use the 20K offer if I received one. The offer usually covers the Monday to Sunday period rather than the Thursday to Wednesday flyer period so you can make the comparison. This strategy works best for products that recurrently go on sale and that you always buy: juice, Phily, margarine, toilet paper...etc. \n\n\\- When I have the 20 000 points offer, I do my grocery online and pick it up (small fee). I do it that way because if I'm missing a few dollars to reach 200$, I can do a search by category and filter by price (sometimes there are additional sales I didn't know about). \"Oh, I could buy frozen spinach or jam\", or whatever thing. As long as you’re not buying (in my case) the Breyers at 8$ per container rather than 4$ when it’s on sale, you’re not getting \"had\" by the store. (Also, OMG heaven to not have to walk through the aisles and wait in line.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo accumulate 450$ in 2 years and a half, I figure I used the 20K points offer about 8-9 times combined with the other PC points grabs. It’s a lot of work but it’s a heck of a lot of groceries too. Holy, have prices gone up on everything... That money is really welcome.\n\nBTW my mother also gets these offers and uses a similar strategy in another province (though she can't earn nearly as many points having no kids), so I’m not an outlier. This is just how the system works and how you can make it work for you! (Funny story: one day I excitedly told her about my discovery once I got to the 80 000 points mark and she's like, \"meh, I've accumulated 100 000 points\". She was already \"using\" the program. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree 😊\n\nThis post was REALLY hard to organize and I hope it was clear enough and not just a huge wall of text... \n\nGood luck saving!",
