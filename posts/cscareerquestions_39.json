I recently added on an Information Systems degree which will push my graduation from this spring to this fall (Adding the IS degree added 1 extra semester of schooling). My question: Is adding the second degree worth it? I'm currently working at an MSP to build experience and plan to take Sec+ this summer. Just having 2nd thoughts about adding the IS degree along with my Cyber degree because I don't know if it's really worth it to be in school longer, albeit only 1 semester. Any advice right now is appreciated. Thank you.",

        "text": "I work at a quite large company. My work depends on other teams from different departments, such as IT. The thing is, they are slow on responding to our tickets, could even take up to a week before anything is resolved. I also rely on their infrastructure, which is in many instances unstable and so I often cannot release my features on time. My team's feature releases are also impacting another team's deadlines (i.e. my \"clients\") and they are often pressuring me to release the features soon because they have a deadline to their own \"clients\". So it becomes a chain of delays.\n\nI don't want to release a feature that's not properly tested yet, especially regression wise, but at the same time I have to wait until the infrastructure on which I test on (which is made by the IT team) becomes stable. And if their infrastructure is unstable, my team's also become unstable. I feel bad for my \"clients\" because their work is closer to giving value to the company, and they often are frustrated waiting for my team's bug fixes and having to deal with server down times.\n\nThe IT guys say that they are working agile, meaning that my tickets/complaints are going to be picked up next sprint. This makes our team sort of also have to adopt that way of working. I feel things become very slow this way.\n\nIs there a way to change this? I hate seeing my clients getting frustrated all the time, but at the same time my team can't do anything much because of external dependencies that require possibly the CEO to make a change. It often becomes a game of finger pointing of whose fault it is, and it makes relations between my team and my clients not so good. I really wonder how this company can make so much money with all these inefficiencies.",

        "text": "A while back, at Yahoo, we were looking for React frontend engineers for Mail.\n\nI knew a React frontend guy from my previous company.  I reached out to him on LinkedIn and he was still at my previous company.  I talked up Yahoo to him: I knew what they paid at the previous company so I knew he‚Äôd make a lot more at Yahoo, like 50% more.  Yeah, he was interested.  So, I told him to send me a resume.\n\nHe sends me a resume and, along with it, he writes: ‚ÄúReact is fun to play with but it‚Äôs too easy.  I don‚Äôt waste my time on the easy stuff.  Now, I‚Äôm doing backend with ElasticSearch, scaling, Akka.‚Äù I reply: ‚ÄúWell, the job is React.  Are you still interested?‚Äù  He replies: ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm interested.‚Äù\n\nI talk to my boss and he says, ‚ÄúHis resume has some backend.‚Äù  I say: ‚ÄúBack when I worked with him, he was a full time React dev.  He was actually the guy who pushed to get the company to adopt React.‚Äù  Later, my boss said, ‚ÄúI thought about it and I guess that there will some advantage to him knowing React but knowing some backend, too.‚Äù\n\nThey did the interview and I heard later that the guy didn‚Äôt get the job.\n\nWhy?\n\nNobody cared that he dis‚Äôd React.  Fine, React is easy.  Even if React sucks, that‚Äôs what we use, that‚Äôs what the job is about and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for.  He tried to impress us with how smart he is, how he does complicated stuff in backend tech, how React would be ‚Äúno problem‚Äù.  Fine, it‚Äôs nice that he is smart.  But then we talked to him about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, he kind of flubbed it.  I knew that he knew React and had done it before but even on easy questions about CSS or JavaScript, he fell apart.\n\nThe moral of the story is, I guess, for 99% of employers, we are hiring you to employ a specific skill and do a specific job.  If it‚Äôs a React job, we want to be reassured that you can come in and, in a month or two, create some minor React PRs.  It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôve got a PhD in ML.  It‚Äôs fine if you won the Nobel Prize in Physics.  It‚Äôs fine if you are crazy smart.  It‚Äôs fine if you have a bunch of prestigious employers on your resume.  But, in the end, we hire you because we need our damn React PRs.  We may be impressed but, if we doubt your ability to do React PRs, we are going to be concerned about giving you the job.\n\nFAANG has so many teams and does everything under the sun so they can hire smart people and then assign them to a team that can use their skills.  FAANG can hire a PhD in ML and then later match that PhD to team that needs PhDs in ML.  But 99% of employers can‚Äôt do that.  They‚Äôve got to hire people with specific skills to perform specific jobs.  Because 99% don‚Äôt have a ton of teams, don‚Äôt do everything under the sun and don‚Äôt have a job for every skill.\n\nThat‚Äôs why FAANG cares so much about ‚Äúbeing smart‚Äù and LC and 99% of employers don‚Äôt care that much.",

        "text": "TL;DR: \"I am an Electronics Engineering graduate who has been a game developer for the past two years. I love coding and I am usually good at it. I am now looking for a software related career which doesn't necessarily pay high wages but has reasonable job opportunities, fine work life balance and opportunity to grow. In short, a career with a chill life.\"\n\nHey everyone, lately I have been really confused regarding my career. I love being a software developer, yet I am not sure which path to take towards the future. I want to give you a brief context:\n\n* I have a B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering (EE), my grades were usually not very well except for the classes that had some sort of coding (VHDL/Verilog, C/C++, Python), in which I got mostly A's.\n* Following that, I acquired quite a bit of experience in MATLAB (scientific simulations), Python (deep learning, speech processing, image processing), C# (game development with Unity). \n* Then, I founded a mobile game company together with two other co-founders. We secured an investment and got to work with a small team (10 people at maximum, 4 developers). After 2 years, I got seriously burnt out so I quit the company following a talk with my co-founders.\n\nAt this point, I don't really know how to continue with my career. I have a few considerations which should help:\n\n* I love coding of any kind and I am usually pretty good at it, so I know I want to be involved in software in my career.\n* I don't have a CS degree, so I am lacking on the foundations. On the other hand, I have an EE degree, so I have a quite good knowledge of math, physics, basic engineering etc.\n* This point is probably the most important one. **I am not looking for high wages. I don't want to be challenged day &amp; night to earn ridiculous amounts of money or compete with all kinds of ambitious people for a top tier position. I just want a career which has a good number of job opportunities, fine work life balance and opportunity to grow.**\n\nI really want to hear you people's thoughts and advices on this topic. Thanks everyone in advance.",

        "text": "Most discussions I see about ChatGPT/AI seem to talk about jobs that it will almost fully replace. What is missing is consideration for the broad effect of increased productivity. If the average person can produce 1.5x more, that materially and significantly affects the supply/demand dynamics of the labor market, all else equal. \n\nAnd it is doing that - making people more productive. If you haven‚Äôt found a way for ChatGPT to help you significantly, I really think you don‚Äôt understand where it can perform well. For one, it is clearly very helpful for learning basic things you are unfamiliar with. One constant challenge in CS is keeping up with the new technologies. Now you can do that a lot easier. From a company standpoint, you have a more flexible workforce, which ultimately means you need fewer people or can pay less. The increased learning rate also affects the barrier to entry for the field broadly, which matters. \n\nCertainly there is a spectrum of how useful it can be. If you are writing code that requires significant contextual knowledge of the code base, which is very common, yeah it won‚Äôt be able to help as much (today).\n\nBut how many times to professional devs google things to aid in development? A lot. In many of those cases ChatGPT can help. \n\nAlso, it will only get better. I see a lot of folks dismissing it because of its current capabilities, saying things like ‚ÄúIf you understood AI‚Äù, even dismissing very near term likelihoods - things that are being demonstrated in the recent literature, today, on a limited basis.  \n\nI career changed from mechanical engineering. A significant part of the relative depressed wages for classical mechanical design jobs has been software automation. It used to be the case it took  20 people to do highly skilled hand calculations for some job. Those 20 jobs have been replaced, gradually over time, by 1 person that is epically more productive with an engineering software package. When that software was being introduced it *felt* like wow we are just so much more productive. At the same time many students were going into the field because of the high demand in recent history. There are many other factors and nuances, and this may be a more extreme case, but this is an example of how productivity tools can shift supply/demand dynamics. \n\nIt could also be the case that more productivity creates more work to be done. Someone creates an App Store, now 100x the people are working on apps, as a crude example. Or perhaps more code generally means more potential security vulnerabilities, therefore increased need for those folks. \n\nThe supply/demand dynamics are complex. I feel skepticism for anyone claiming they *know* how it is going to be, which seems to be most folks. \n\nAt the same time, it is definitely the case that whatever you thought before ChatGPT/GPT3/etc, it almost certainly has to be adjusted a non-zero amount in negative direction for the broad CS labor market. And it is certainly just plain silly to dismiss the concerns that people express on this topic. \n\nPersonally, I think the supply side growing massively in the last ~4 years with almost every university tripling their CS programs, will also be a key driver. I do think that the demand for CS jobs will increase rapidly at as well, but not like 3x in 4 years fast. My wild guess for CS wages in the next 20 years is that they will come down to be roughly similar to other engineering disciplines again, as the supply for those in terms of college admissions are going the opposite direction on a relative basis. But what do I know - just another person trying to bet my future on what skills I choose to specialize in now.",

        "text": "Some context:\n\nI‚Äôm currently a freshman. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness in fall semester so I couldn‚Äôt focus on school, so I wasn‚Äôt able to do extracurriculars. I barely passed my classes except one A‚Ä¶ and, I have to retake my intro to CS course since I missed so many lectures (I didn‚Äôt fail it though, I received a temporary grade given in cases of emergencies). \n\nI‚Äôm now in my second semester of university. I am working on raising my GPA and everything is going well since I‚Äôm in remission, I have all As. \n\nMy goal is to be apply for internships in August and hopefully get an internship for after my sophomore year.\n\nI plan on taking summer classes, Data Structures and Calculus 2 in order to not be behind. \n\nI didn‚Äôt do to well in Calculus 1 so I am reteaching that to myself so I can be prepared. Since I‚Äôm retaking intro to CS, I decided that I want to really make sure I understand the material and have a fresh start. But, I still saw most of the material before, so I am self studying the material and getting ahead of the class. I specifically made a study schedule so I could learn everything a month before lectures finish. \n\nI am also taking CS50 in order to learn additional technologies and I heard it‚Äôs an amazing course so I thought it could be usedul. I plan on finishing CS50 around the same time as I finish self studying my intro to cs class.\n\nSince I‚Äôll have more than a month between the time I finish CS50/intro to cs, I wanted to start self studying data structures so I could be ahead. Alongside that, I wanted to do Scrimba courses (the entirety of the frontend developer path) since it was something a Redditor recommended to me. And since I‚Äôll be able to finish data structures early, I‚Äôll have time to practice Leetcode and do personal projects (I plan on finishing Scrimba around the same time as data structures).\n\nI‚Äôm doing a lot of self studying and I have no time to do anything else. I have not had a single moment of downtime ever since the semester started. Which is fine, I am feeling very motivated right now and I want to do this. It feels like so much work, and even if I wake up super early and go to sleep super late I still find myself falling behind my self-study schedule sometimes. \n\nBut I am unable to do extracurriculars, and I don‚Äôt even have the time. I haven‚Äôt had any time to develop any hobbies or skills outside CS and school. I can‚Äôt join any CS clubs because I know literally nothing right now.\n\nOnce I start my sophomore year, I won‚Äôt be behind the other CS majors, so I‚Äôll of course make sure to set aside time for deveoping personal interests and extracurriculars because I know how important those are to recruiters. \n\nI‚Äôm worried that because I couldn‚Äôt do extracurriculars, now I am completely screwed for getting any sort of internship. \n\nBut I heard that personal projects are also important; I am taking some courses that make you do personal projects like CS50‚Äôs capstone project and the various things Scrimba courses make you create. So I wanted to do those. Plus, I wanted to make open source contributions- I have no idea what that means but I heard recruiters LOVE those so I plan on doing those. \n\nI do NOT plan on making easy projects though. I know recruiters want more than just some shitty tic tac toe or a basic website/app. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll make right NOW, but I want to do something creative.\n\nI know I‚Äôm not in an ideal situation at all without any extracurriculars but I‚Äôm just trying to do my best.\n\nI guess my question is, if I make good enough personal projects and open source contributions, would MAANG companies ever consider me for an interview? Or at least any other company? Or is the job market still gonna be as bad in August as it is right now and I‚Äôll be ghosted? Are there any other things I should know that would be useful in getting an internship?\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Just looking for some recommendations -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently a senior CS student (but won't graduate until next fall), however I am currently working as a data analyst for a small company writing SQL queries for health-related reporting.  I got the job as a promotion doing something not related to CS, so it is more healthcare knowledge based for me rather than the SQL/data analysis. That I have learned independently thanks to a variety of W3 Schools, CodeAcademy, and books I've purchased and read outside of work. \n\nBecause I have been working all this time and going to school, I have not completed any internships or side projects. I am hoping to put together a portfolio of some side projects during the summer this year and then after I graduate. Most CS programs are Java based - as is mine. I plan to have, I guess, some Java projects as well as accomplishments I've worked on via work. \n\nI guess my main concern is that because my experience is 100% data, reporting, and SQL queries and database management that I won't be considered for other opportunities in CS. That makes me a little nervous, because I have heard when you are working in data that you are often competing with people with Master's degrees and PHDs, while I don't intend to complete anymore schoolwork after I graduate - I'd rather use that time to learn other languages and build projects. \n\nThe company I work for is small, and the pay is very below market - so staying here long term isn't necessarily my long term goal. I like it here and I'm not necessarily in a hurry to leave, but I want to pay these student loans off quick. \n\nI just wanted to ask for some recommendations - what would be the best path for me that would make me have more opportunities instead of only being qualified to apply for a few different roles? I want to be able to cast the widest net of applications that I can when I get out of school. \n\n  \nThanks ahead for the advice!",

        "text": "Hi. \n\nLong story short, did quite a few internships at a company that is among the big 5 and I am currently in the conversion to FTE process. However, because of the layoffs, I got no news on anything, I dont even have a recruiter anymore. I partly assumed the conversion is not happening anymore.\n\nMy start date was supposed to be in November but in the meantime I managed to get a job and now an offer for an internship till the end of the year at the biggest company in my country (the first company would require me to relocate). I would accept this internship because the company is amazing, but in case I still get the conversion for the first one - would it be acceptable to resign from the internship? Would that put me on any sort of black list (apart from the fact that the manager would probably be mad at me)? I am asking because of course, you never know what's in the store for you, so I dont want to burn all the bridges with the company in my country because I really like it.  \n\nDoes any of you have any experience or heard of any similar situation? How bad is resigning from an internship, really?",

        "text": "Hi all, I'm a bit more than halfway through a CS degree, but due to some unforseen circumstances, I'm forced to take this semester off. So, I'd like to take this time to do some prep work and try get my first position before resuming school in the fall.  \n\nAt this point, I'm pretty proficient in the standard libraries of Java and Python, somewhat less so with C, and reasonably familiar with SQL. As far as coursework goes, I've had into to software development, intro to systems, systems programming, discrete math, data structures and software design, and algorithms. So, I'm not completely clueless, but I also have no idea how much of this translates to the real world.\n\nIf I were to set a goal of sending out resumes by June, what do you think the best approach would be? Focus solely on Leetcode style problem solving? Build some projects? A mixture? I do have a github with a fair amount of code on it, but it's all school stuff so most of it is not terribly impressive.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
