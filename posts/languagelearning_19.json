        "text": "This has been my experience and I hope it is informative for those interested in Arabic. \n\n--\n\n* Broken Plural\n\nNouns in Modern Standard Arabic (henceforth \"Arabic\") can be masculine or feminine. Feminine nouns usually and in ـة and tend to have a regular plural form ending in ـات as in سيارة (car) سيارات (cars). However, masculine nouns can have many plural patterns and it takes a lot of time to understand some predictable patterns that sometimes are not predictable. Basically, for every masculine noun you learn, you'll actually have to learn two because the singular and plural form might not resemble each other to an extent that they may as well be treated as two independent words.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_plural#Patterns_in_Arabic\n\n* Verb Paradigm\n\nArabic verbs have \"measures\" that allow you to manipulate verbs back and forth.  For example:\n\n* A transitive verb in the first measure (فتح - to open) can be made intransitive if put in the seventh measure (انفتح - to be open(ed)). \n* A transitive verb in the second measure (حسّن - to improve) can be made intransitive if put in the fifth measure (تحسّن - to be improved). \n* A reflexive verb in the third measure (شارك - to participate) can be made reciprocal if put in the sixth measure (تشارك - to associate each other with). \n* An intransitive verb in the first measure (نام - to sleep) can be put in the causative aspect in the fourth measure (أنام - to anesthesize). \n* A transitive verb in the eleventh measure (زلزل - to shake) can be made transitive in the twelfth measure (تزلزل - to shake (intransitive)). \n\nWhen I say \"intransitive\" it can also be \"reflexive\" and \"passive\". I feel like their usage under the new measure can be a bit flexible. \n\nEach measure is conjugated in its own way with its own vowel patters. All measures except for the first one are fully regular.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Arabic_Verb_Chart.png\n\n* Unconjugating Verbs\n\nArabic verbs don't have an infinitive form and in the dictionary they show conjugated in their past tense singular third person masculine forms, i.e. \"he went\", \"he ate\" etc. If they are conjugated in the present tense, you have to undo that conjugation in order to look up the past form in the dictionary. However, undoing that conjugation may lead to ambiguities. \n\nTake the word تزور as an example. One might think that that is a verb in the fifth measure already in the past tense (\"تَزَوَّرَ\") , but it is instead the present tense conjugation of the verb زار which is a verb in the first measure. Another example is the word تحمل. It can be the present tense of حَمَلَ (first measure) as in تَحْمِلُ, it can be the present tense of تَحَمَّلَ (second measure) as in تُحَمِّلُ or actually the already unconjugated past tense form as in تَحَمَّلَ. So تحمل can come from 3 verbs and sometimes it's not easy to tell. There are other ambiguities that happen among other measures.\n\n* Vowels\n\nArabic has 3 vowels (/a/, /i/ and /u/) which are represented in written from using 2 sets of 3 vowels. The long vowels ا, و and ي whose purpose is to give another consonant a sound and the short vowels َ, ُ and ِ whose purpose is mostly grammatical. Long vowels are always written and explicit while short vowels are mostly implicit and unwritten and are only included when you really need to disambiguate things. \n\nIf you haven't understood what I mean, imagine the page of a book in German where 95% of the vowels are missing and most of the words are composed solely of consonants. That's Arabic. To add insult to injury, words can have more than one configuration of vowels and each configuration gives the word a new meaning. Depending on the vowels, a given word can be a noun, an adjective, a verb etc.\n\nLuckily, there are many patterns to figure out the vowels in a word, but you can only rely on them to an extent. \n\n* Radical Vowel\n\nAs I said, verbs in Arabic have measures and the worst measure is the first one because it is the most irregular one. One of the irregularities is the so called \"radical vowel\". Basically, verbs in the first measure are composed of either one or two consonants (فعل or حد) and they may include one long vowel (مات). In a 3-consonant verb, in the past tense (i.e. the \"infinitive\"), the first and last consonant are always paired with a fathah (َthe short vowel /a/) as in كتب (/k**a**tab**a**/) while the vowel in the middle can be paired with a kasrah (short vowel /i/) as in خسر (/xas**i**ɾa/ - he lost), a dammah (short vowel /u/) as in كبر (/kab**u**ɾa/ - he grew) or also another fathah as in ذهب (/ðah**a**ba/ - he went).\n\nHowever, when you conjugate them in the present tense, the radical vowel changes too. The rule goes as follows:\n\nRadical vowel U in the past tense always stays U in the present tense.\n\nRadical vowel I in the past tense becomes A in the present tense (99% of the time, otherwise stays I).\n\nRadical vowel A in the past tense can become A, I or U in the present tense and there are no patterns.\n\nSo:\n\nكبر  /kab**u**ɾa/ (he grew) always stays as  /jakb**u**ɾ(u)/ (he grows)\n \nخسر /xas**i**ɾa/ (he lost) becomes /jaxs**a**ɾ(u)/ (he loses)\n\nوثق /waθ**i**qa/ (he trusted) stays /jaθ**i**q(u)/ (rare)\n\n\nذهب /ðah**a**ba/ (he went) becomes (or stays as) /jaðh**a**b(u)/\n\nهزم /haz**a**ma/ (he defeated) becomes  /jahz**i**m(u)/\n\nكتب /kat**a**ba/ (he wrote) becomes /jakt**u**b(u)/\n\n\nSo when you learn a verb from the first measure, you need to memorize its radical vowel in the past and present tense too. None of this applies to other measures.\n\n* Masdar\n\nMasdar (مصدر) means \"source\" and it works as the verbal noun of a verb, i.e. the action of the verb. Like in \"frustration\" is the masdar of \"to frustrate\" and \"sight\" is the masdar of \"to see\". This is a very useful tool in Arabic because you need it to circumvent the lack of the infinitive. In Arabic you can't say stuff like \"I want to go to the mall\" because there is no \"to go\", only \"he went\", so you use the masdar and it becomes \"It want the going to the mall\". \n\nThe masdar in all verb measures is regular, except in the first measure where it can be anything and a verb in the first measure can have more than one masdar. So, basically, you will have to learn the verb AND the masdar separately as two words because you will rarely be able to guess the masdar from the verb in the first measure.\n\n* Roots\n\nWords in Arabic come about through roots, i.e. an arbitrary combination of two, three or four letters of the alphabet from which all words related to that root will stem. \n\nThe stem ك ت ب (k t b) has to do with words related to writing. From which you get: **k**a**t**a**b**a = he wrote, **k**i**t**aa**b** (book), **k**aa**t**i**b** (writer), ma**k****t**a**b**a (library), mi**k****t**a**b** and etc. This applies to all roots.\n\nhttps://corpus.quran.com/verbs.jsp\n\n* Adverbial Noun\n\nIn most languages that I have seen, adverbs (quick**ly**, slow**ly**, sometimes) come from adjectives (slow = slowly). While this applies to Arabic, sometimes adverbs come from nouns. Arabic has 3 noun cases: nominative (associated with the vowel /u/), accusative (/a/) and genitive (/i/). Generally speaking, in order to turn an adjective into an adverb, you put it in the accusative form. I.e. their -ly looks like ـاً so \"ugly\" being قبيح, if you want to turn it into an adverb (uglily) it becomes قبيحاً. This word may not be used but it is technically correct. \n\nHowever, as I said earlier, you may to this to nouns too. رد (answer) becomes رداً and means \"as an answer to\". تحديد (masdar of حدد (he sharpened) meaning \"sharperning\" or something equivalent) in the accusative تحديداً becomes the adverb \"exactly\". This is difficult because telling the meaning of adverbs that came from adjectives is easy, but deducing the meaning of adverbs that come from a noun is not as straigthforward.\n\n* Gender Agreement\n\nAs in most (?) gendered languages, there is gender agreement. \n\nL**as** cas**as** bonit**as** - the beautiful houses - all words are in their feminine form and I assume this applies to most gendered languages out there.\n\nThis applies to Arabic too but with a caveat. In Arabic, there are two genders in addition to the notion of animacy/inanimacy as you have it in Russian. So in addition to knowing if the noun is masculine or feminine, you need to know if it's animated or not. \n\nBasically, in the singular, the agreement works as you would expect it to. In the plural form, verbs and adjectives connected to plural inanimate nouns are conjugated/declined in the feminine singular.  \n\nThis will be very difficult to explain using English because of its grammatical limitations, but if you say \"the house is built\", \"is built\" would be conjugated in the singular masculine because house in Arabic is a masculine noun, i.e. as you would expect gender to agree. However, if you said \"the houses are built\", both \"are\" and \"built\" will be in the **feminine singular**, despite the subject (houses) being in masculine noun in the plural form). This happens because house is an inanimate noun in the plural. This happens to all inanimate nouns in the plural form despite their gender.\n\n* Passive voices\n\nThere are three ways to express the passive voice in Arabic: the elegant form, the formal form and the colloquial (?) form.\n\nThe elegant form is succint and confusing. You just use the passive conjugation of the verb by changing its vowel combination. كتب (kataba - he wrote) becomes \"he was written\" if you change it to \"kutiba\". The problem is both كتب (kataba - he wrote) and كتب (kutiba - he was written) are written كتب, they look exactly the same. You can help the reader tell kataba apart from kutiba by writing كُتب (ُ = /u/), but not even most newspaper do this.\n\nWhich means you have to basically guess through context when the verb is in the passive voice and that's very difficult to do. In some verbs, conjugation can give it away, but that's an exception.\n\nThe formal form is stricly journalistic. You use a verb (تم) with the masdar of the verb to be \"passivized\". This form is easy, but impractical and reserved to journalistic writings.\n\nThe colloquial (for lack of a better term) is what I call the \"active passive\" voice. The meaning is passive, but you express it using the active voice.  \n\nBasically:\n\n* \"This is the car destroyed by the man\" becomes \"This is the car which the man destroyed it\". \n* \"This is the food eaten by me\" becomes \"This is the food which I ate it\"\n\nYou just put the pronoun related to the noun after the verb and that's the passive voice. This one is most used because it also allows you to indicate who did the action, whereas indicating the doer of the action using the previous 2 forms requires clunky grammar.\n\n* Alphabet\n\nThe alphabet is written from right to left and its letters can change form depending if they are in the beginning, middle or end of a word. The letter ه /h/ has 3 forms هـ، ـهـ and ـه. Plus the vowel thing where they are implicit makes Arabic one of the toughest languages to learn how to read. Speaking it is way easier. I estimate you can learn to speak (and only speak) a dialect of Arabic in 6 months if your teacher is competent, but learning to fluently read MSA is a 2 years' job. \n\n* Numerals\n\nArabic numerals are a hassle. Depending on the numeral, the noun may take different form. Like from 0 to 10, the noun must be in a noun case, from from 11 to 20 in another noun case. I haven't memorized all the rules yet.\n\nhttps://www.fluentarabic.net/numbers-in-arabic/",

This has been true for us with French and Spanish. This coloring book has a script alongside each picture and even includes audio. There are over 300 phrases non-native speaking parents and caregivers can say to their kids while they color. That way, you can feel confident kids are getting proper grammar and a varied vocabulary. I would say there is at least two hours worth of practice to get to the fluency goal!\n\nFor example, you can say, \"Stay in the lines,\" (\"Reste dans les ligne\"), \"Color the pig pink,\" (\"Peux-tu colorier les cochons en rose ?\"), \"Complete the maze,\" (\"Complète le labyrinthe.\"), \"Use a pencil\", (\"Utilise un crayon.\") and so on.\n\nI was struggling to provide an immersive environment for my kids and thought this was one great way to add to their fluency because a weekly tutor, books and TV was not enough.\n\nPlease DM me so I can send you a free copy.",

Therefore, for the large majority of my life I have spoken English on a daily basis. \n\nHowever, both of my parents are of Finnish descent. My Dad was born in Finland and my mother comes from a strong Finnish-American family (retained language, culture, etc.) Therefore, I was surrounded by and spoke Finnish for much of my younger life. As I got older, English has been infused more and more to the point that we speak 'Fin-glish'. \n\nThis did not bother me for a while, but I have recently started making more trips back to Finland, and within the past 6 months started on a romantic relationship with a Finnish guy. Since he is from a relatively remote part of Finland, his English is not always great. Therefore, we similarly use a mix of Finnish and English to communicate. Being with him has reminded me why I love my language and I am seriously considering moving to Finland in the future. \n\nMy question is: when I eventually come around to having children (with this man, or another), with which language should I speak to the child? In Finnish, or in English? I am not a language expert by any means, so I figured someone here might have the answer.",

Besides the data and studies he refers to, he has shared a handful of anecdotes here and there in various interviews/clips of individuals he knew who attained near-native or native-like fluency through sheer amounts of comprehensible input – obviously massive amounts, in the thousands of hours. \n\nSo I'm just wondering if anyone here actually has succeeded in doing just that for their target language – having native-like output emerge through sheer amounts of comprehensible input. And if so, if they could share details about their language learning experience. I know phrases like near-native and native-like are hard to quantify and not necessarily super meaningful as a metric. Krashen has also described it as a level of language acquisition such that one is mistaken for a native. I'm not interested in getting into a debate about these terms, but just would like to hear about people's experience if they feel that their experience matches up with Krashen's theory as described above. To that end I'm happy to hear from people who are even only just a strong C1 in their target language, even if they don't feel like they've attained the near-native/native-like level described by Krashen.",

The rule goes as follows:\n\nRadical vowel U in the past tense always stays U in the present tense.\n\nRadical vowel I in the past tense becomes A in the present tense (99% of the time, otherwise stays I).\n\nRadical vowel A in the past tense can become A, I or U in the present tense and there are no patterns.\n\nSo:\n\nكبر  /kab**u**ɾa/ (he grew) always stays as  /jakb**u**ɾ(u)/ (he grows)\n \nخسر /xas**i**ɾa/ (he lost) becomes /jaxs**a**ɾ(u)/ (he loses)\n\nوثق /waθ**i**qa/ (he trusted) stays /jaθ**i**q(u)/ (rare)\n\n\nذهب /ðah**a**ba/ (he went) becomes (or stays as) /jaðh**a**b(u)/\n\nهزم /haz**a**ma/ (he defeated) becomes  /jahz**i**m(u)/\n\nكتب /kat**a**ba/ (he wrote) becomes /jakt**u**b(u)/\n\n\nSo when you learn a verb from the first measure, you need to memorize its radical vowel in the past and present tense too. None of this applies to other measures.\n\n* Masdar\n\nMasdar (مصدر) means \"source\" and it works as the verbal noun of a verb, i.e. the action of the verb. Like in \"frustration\" is the masdar of \"to frustrate\" and \"sight\" is the masdar of \"to see\". This is a very useful tool in Arabic because you need it to circumvent the lack of the infinitive. In Arabic you can't say stuff like \"I want to go to the mall\" because there is no \"to go\", only \"he went\", so you use the masdar and it becomes \"It want the going to the mall\". \n\nThe masdar is all verb measures is regular, except in the first measure where it can be anything and a verb in the first measure can have more than one masdar. So, basically, you will have to learn the verb AND the masdar separately as two words because you will rarely be able to guess the masdar from the verb in the first measure.\n\n* Roots\n\nWords in Arabic come about through roots, i.e. an arbitrary combination of two, three or four letters of the alphabet from which all words related to that root will stem. \n\nThe stem ك ت ب (k t b) has to do with words related to writing. From which you get: **k**a**t**a**b**a = he wrote, **k**i**t**aa**b** (book), **k**aa**t**i**b** (writer), ma**k****t**a**b**a (library), mi**k****t**a**b** and etc. This applies to all roots.\n\nhttps://corpus.quran.com/verbs.jsp\n\n* Adverbial Noun\n\nIn most languages that I have seen, adverbs (quick**ly**, slow**ly**, sometimes) come from adjectives (slow = slowly). While this applies to Arabic, sometimes adverbs come from nouns. Arabic has 3 noun cases: nominative (associated with the vowel /u/), accusative (/a/) and genitive (/i/). Generally speaking, in order to turn an adjective into an adverb, you put it in the accusative form. I.e. their -ly looks like ـاً so \"ugly\" being قبيح, if you want to turn it into an adverb (uglily) it becomes قبيحاً. This word may not be used but it is technically correct. \n\nHowever, as I said earlier, you may to this to nouns too. رد (answer) becomes رداً and means \"as an answer to\". تحديد (masdar of حدد (he sharpened) meaning \"sharperning\" or something equivalent) in the accusative تحديداً becomes the adverb \"exactly\". This is difficult because telling the meaning of adverbs that came from adjectives is easy, but deducing the meaning of adverbs that come from a noun is not as straigthforward.\n\n* Gender Agreement\n\nAs in most (?) gendered languages, there is gender agreement. \n\nL**as** cas**as** bonit**as** - the beautiful houses - all words are in their feminine form and I assume this applies to most gendered languages out there.\n\nThis applies to Arabic too but with a caveat. In Arabic, there are two genders in addition to the notion of animacy/inanimacy as you have it in Russian. So in addition to knowing if the noun is masculine or feminine, you need to know if it's animated or not. \n\nBasically, in the singular, the agreement works as you would expect it to. In the plural form, verbs and adjectives connected to plural inanimate nouns are conjugated/declined in the feminine singular.  \n\nThis will be very difficult to explain using English because of its grammatical limitations, but if you say \"the house is built\", \"is built\" would be conjugated in the singular masculine because house in Arabic is a masculine noun, i.e. as you would expect gender to agree. However, if you said \"the houses are built\", both \"are\" and \"built\" will be in the **feminine singular**, despite the subject (houses) being in masculine noun in the plural form). This happens because house is an inanimate nouns in the plural. This happens to all inanimate nouns in the plural form despite their gender.\n\n* Passive voices\n\nThere are three ways to express the passive voice in Arabic: the elegant form, the formal form and the colloquial (?) form.\n\nThe elegant form is succint and confusing. You just use the passive conjugation of the verb by changing its vowel combination. كتب (kataba - he wrote) becomes \"he was written\" if you change it to \"kutiba\". The problem is both كتب (kataba - he wrote) and كتب (kutiba - he was written) are written كتب, they look exactly the same. You can help the reader tell kataba apart from kutiba by writing كُتب (ُ = /u/), but not even most newspaper do this.\n\nWhich means you have to basically guess through context when the verb is in the passive voice and that's very difficult to do.\n\nThe formal form is stricly journalistic. You use a verb (تم) with the masdar of the verb to be \"passivized\". This form is easy, but impractical and reserved to journalistic writings.\n\nThe colloquial (for lack of a better term) is what I call the \"active passive\" voice. The meaning is passive, but you express it using the active voice.  \n\nBasically:\n\n* \"This is the car destroyed by the man\" becomes \"This is the car which the man destroyed it\". \n* \"This is the cup I drank from\" becomes \"This is the cup which I drank from it\"\n\nYou just put the pronoun related to the noun after the verb and that's the passive voice. This one is most used because it also allows you to indicate who did the action, whereas indicating the doer of the action using the previous 2 forms requires clunky grammar.\n\n* Alphabet\n\nThe alphabet is written from right to left and its letters can change form depending if they are in the beginning, middle or end of a word. The letter ه /h/ has 3 forms هـ، ـهـ and ـه. Plus the vowel thing where they are implicit makes Arabic one of the toughest languages to learn how to read. Speaking it is way easier.\n\n* Numerals\n\nArabic numerals are a hassle. Depending on the numeral, the noun may take different form. Like from 0 to 10, the noun must be in a noun case, from from 11 to 20 in another noun case. I haven't memorized all the rules yet.\n\nhttps://www.fluentarabic.net/numbers-in-arabic/",

My listening is pretty good, functional, enjoyable etc., but not “perfect” (like getting every word) and it’s far enough from perfect that I’m motivated to work on it.\r\n\r\n(Also, I have no confidence in my ability to measure my comprehension at like “97%” or something, because a.) what does that even mean? and b.) my brain (like all brains I imagine) is extremely good at filling in the blanks, to the point where I’m sure it tricks me into thinking I understand more than I do.)\r\n\r\nThinking about this problem out loud:\r\n\r\n- I don’t think this is a problem of volume, ie, hours of listening. I’ve tracked my listening, and I’ve been listening to native content for years and years now (big fan of podcasts in general). I think I’ve averaged 15-20 hours a week for many years now.\r\n- I don’t think it’s a problem of content difficulty either. I haven’t found content harder than what I listen to, and I usually speed it up at least 1.25x too.\r\n- Going back through Netflix subtitles for those phrases I might not get, I don’t think it’s a gap in vocabulary.\r\n- Comprehension goes down significantly if I don’t wear headphones, which I usually do.\r\n- If the problem is that the content I listen to is too “clean and well presented”, where I can I find content where people mumble all the time? Some TV and movies are like that, for a handful of lines here and there, but I don’t think it’s enough. Podcasts, being made for audio only, are usually fairly well produced, even if it’s just a bunch of people chewing the fat.  \r\n- I’m dating a native speaker of my TL (only a few months though so far), and we almost exclusively talk in this TL. I guess she might make her speech easier for me to understand, but maybe not since she uses a lot of slang anyway?\r\n- Do I need to attack this problem surgically? Are there any targeted exercises or activities I should engage in? Should I rewind on every single Netflix thing that I don’t fully understand (which honestly sounds incredibly dull) and does that actually help?\r\n\nAny advice? Thanks!",

I'm not aimed at fluency as well, I'm happy to understand the structure, the grammar and be able to read and understand spoken language. However in the future I'd like to take a course for the third language as well. Both languages are from the same language family and I'm sure knowing one will help with studying the other. With that in mind, I feel like learning Spanish (and I also have Latin) feels more like diving into roman languages. However, I also have a feeling that Spanish is easier to study, so it makes more sense to leave Spanish for an outside language course and pick French as a university subject.

This was helpful to me to be able to hear a single word again and again, from multiple individuals with different tones and accents, without having to rewind a YouTube video by a few seconds.\n\n**Google-fu**\n\nI took advantage of Google to see how specific words are used formally and in structured sentences by searching BBC News' [Yoruba](https://www.bbc.com/yoruba) section. For example, if I wanted to check whether \"a citizen of the UK\" or \"UK citizen\" was correctly \"ọmọ orilẹ-ede UK\", I can search Google for \"site:bbc.com/yoruba ọmọ orilẹ-ede\" to see if this is used in the way I understood.\n\n**[Naijish](https://naijish.com/)**\n\nNaijish has some great resources including most popular verbs and explanations of tenses. I didn't find their subscription to be worthwhile at this stage, but there's plenty of free content to use.\n\n**Apps**\n\n[Anki](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US) - I'm sure you've all heard of this one\n\n[Mandla](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mandla.mandla&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US) - this is a promising app that supports multiple African languages from Amharic to Igbo, to Twi and of course Yoruba.",

And it stayed that way until March of 2022 when I decided to move to South Korea for many reasons. After that, my taste for the Korean language increased a lot, but the Japanese decreased considerably.\n\nI am still learning both languages because they bring me good times when I am consuming content in their respective languages (I spend more time watching anime than Korean dramas). But I cannot lie to myself: maybe Japanese isn't anymore for me, at least for a time. It's not fun anymore to seat on the chair and start to read some grammar rules and acquire vocabulary here and there, although it's still funny and proud to have noticing when watching or reading something.\n\nIs it normal to be in this kind of situation?",

I have decent grammar and vocabulary but my conversations always felt stale and unnatural. So after pondering for a while I found the concept of \"transition words\" let me give you some examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAinsi que = as well\n\nAutrement dit = in other words\n\nTant que = as long as\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are words and phrases that tie or glue sentenses togheter. You only get so far with practising vocabulary and doing grammar, in real life the transition words are the backbone of a well flowing conversation. I use to always answer \"oui\" (yes) or \"d'accord\" (ok) to everything but you can always spice things up with stuff like \"tout a fait\" (absolutely), \"c'est vrai\" (that's right) etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy advice is search up lists of transition words in your target language, it will do wonders for you not sounding like a robot in conversations. For experienced language learners this is propbably obvious and old, but as for myself i never put any regards to it but when I did it made wonders! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I hope this will be useful for somebody!

It's this special tense that Spanish uses to describe wishes/desires/hypothetical situations and things like, but it's got lots of little triggers and exceptions to the rules and the general idea of it just doesn't exist in English in remotely the same way. It's a pretty universal struggle at the pre-B2 level I would say. The alternative might be the different types of past tense in Spanish, but I think that's something you encounter a bit earlier and it starts to make sense (at least to me) a lot earlier. But yeah, feeling the subjunctive \"in your bones\" the way that native speakers do is something I envy!\n\nAnyway, I love these parts of linguistics, so tell me what funky feature does your TL have that learners just can't get their head around (at first)?",

        "text": "(I made a similar post on this sub a few days ago, and I got great advice. Now I want to explain my problems more specifically and ask more details about the feedback I’ve got, so I’m writing here again. Thank you for the comment on the previous post. I appreciate your knowledge about leaning languages.)\n\nSo I’m Japanese who currently started learning English seriously to get a certificate which I’ll need to use English to get.\nI had studied English for 6 years in school classes. And I’ve been in a relationship with an American bf for over 7 years. When I first met him I could barely speak English, but as I communicate with him my speaking and listening skills got improved till I can express myself maybe about 40% of what I can in Japanese, and I understand 80% of English content in listening. But I keep making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation when I speak, and my vocabulary is so small that I sound like a child. I get used to his English (he has no accent) so I can understand him but I have trouble understanding others than him because of the difference of sounds and vocabulary. So there is really a lot to improve.\n\nI was always interested in English to certain extent because it broadens my world and gives me cutting-edge higher quality info than Japanese. However, I am lazy and not patient so I didn’t start  any active learning until I decided to get the certificate. Sometimes I searched for information in English on YouTube but mostly my english related activity was only the communication with my bf. I encountered many new words but I never looked them up and they never really sticked to me.\nI guess my problem is that I have lower capacity for working memory than average (I took an IQ test and the score was 96 for WM), and that means I can’t remember things so easily. So I need repetition. I recently started building Anki deck whenever I encounter new words. Also I started making posts on Reddit for writing practice and being aware of my grammar mistakes.\nAnother problem I am aware of is that I am too passive that my brain can’t really recognize what I should remember. I am a good guesser and I can sometimes tell what’s gonna happen in movies even though I understand just 80% of what the characters say. I can miss many pieces of info but still understand the whole stories and that’s how I developed my bad habit of not recognizing new words. So I think I need to be more intentional to what I need to learn and become an active learner.\nAlso because of the lack of working memory, I can’t speak with longer sentences. I want to practice to speak longer to explain what I really mean in detail.\n\nTo get the certificate, I expect I’ll need to explain my opinions and understand others, and practice to become a teacher, so it’s gonna be a lot of communication (which will be online).\n\nFrom the advice on my previous post, what I’m considering to do are:\n•learning from a text book (maybe for B1 or B2)\n•writing and getting corrected online everyday\n•extensive reading (maybe I’ll start from articles)\n•watching many different YouTube Channels \n•joining online pre classes for the certificate\n(Now I understand getting corrected by my bf is not a good idea.)\n\nBut I am afraid that I can become a passive learner in the last three activities and I can’t really get benefit from them and they ended up wasting my time. Do you expect me to look up new words and add them to my Anki deck during those 3 activities? (I feel exhausted even just thinking of that)\nAlso I don’t have much time to spend maybe like 3  hours per day. And I want to start the program for the certificate at the end of this year. So I really need to optimize what to do.\n\nSo the overall question here is how can I learn English more efficiently to reach the goal of getting the certificate.\nAny tips or advice would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nMy current English skill levels (which are just my guess) and the problems are:\n\n-Listening skill: B1 \n• I have trouble understanding people with accent\n• I can’t catch the words in movies but I can in explanation videos (because I can guess more)\n\n-Speaking skill: B1\n•keep making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation especially with L and R\n•my bf says I speak understandable English except the pronunciation with L and R\n\n-Reading skill: B1\n•I can’t understand news or technical articles\n•I have to look up words and phrases on Reddit sometimes \n\n-writing skill: B1\n•I make  grammar errors which I can’t recognize unless someone tells me\n•lack of vocabulary\n•I am not good at written English compared to oral English\n•I make up phrases that native speakers won’t use",

It's clearly an issue that a lot of us language learners share and can be an obstacle in our progression towards fluency.\n\nI'm wondering if people had not practical tips but more so psychological recommendations for those who are really struggling with their TL production. \n\nIt's super easy to think \"Oh I need to speak more\" or \"Only way to learn to talk is to talk\" but when you're in a group of native speakers, it's much more challenging.\n\nWhat are the things you say to yourself in that situation or what is some of the best advice you've been given and really resonated with? Thank you :)",

I also browse the Internet pretty much exclusively in English.\n\nI wonder, could I possibly claim to have learned a foreign language? I would very much like to be able to say that, but I am unsure if I am allowed to.\n\nWhat do you think? Would that be an outrageous claim?",
