        "text": "I am one of those people who has unintentionally developed muscle memory for pressing CAPS to type a capital followed by pressing CAPS a second time to revert to lowercase (I'm so sorry!), and I type fast. \nThis means that I always end up with both the first and the second letters being capitalised. I must always backspace that second character and replace with a lowercase. Needless to say this hampers my creativity and looks ridiculous.\n\nMicrosoft Windows tolerates my weird typing habit but Linux does not. Is there some change I can make to perhaps increase the keyboard polling rate so that I can switch to using Linux full-time without dying inside every time I have to type a sentence?\n\n\nPlease be gentle! :-p",

        "text": "On a mac and even on Windows, I can be okay without a touchscreen because pinch to zoom on the trackpad works exactly the same as if it was the touchscreen, however after almost 1 year since I switched to linux, I haven't been able to find a distro/laptop/DesktopEnvironment/Wayland-x11 combination that gives me TRUE pinch to zoom on touchpad like the mac or windows.\n\nWHY? I have some laptops with touch displays, and the pinch to zoom works fine on those screens but not on the touchpad of the same laptop, it's as if the OS couldn't understand that I'm trying to do the same thing on the touchpad as if I was on the touchscreen, the best I can get is browser zoom % increase which is SHIT compared to actually zooming in on content by pinching.\n\nAny solutions to this?",

        "text": "On Windows NTFS formatted drives, reading the MFT allows for much faster file info without needing to traverse the disk. This is used by utils like Everything, WizTree, TreeSize etc that work much faster, provide instant search results etc. Even on a 4TB drive with millions of files these utils work very fast and dont have to scan the drive.\n\nDo inodes in Linux provide similar functionality? And are there any utils which do a similar job? This qn is for ext3/4, I think btrfs/xfs may have more metadata.",

That'd be sweet bc I don't like the default.\n- how do I connect a Bluetooth device when I don't know the device pointer/address/number thingies?
