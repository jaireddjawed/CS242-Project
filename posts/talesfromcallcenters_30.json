Frantic, I logged into an account on a gift giving site but I couldn't find her work address, where she will be on her birthday.  \n\nI called the customer support, hoping against hope that they could help me.  I spoke to a young lady. I explained the situation and after answering some security questions and getting clearance from a supervisor was able to give me an address that I sent a gift to last year on the same date.\n\nI will be forever grateful to her for helping me lift the spirits of my friend.

I'd just gone over about 20 at her request when we normally just do five, and she kept talking over me to answer questions that I would have addressed had she given me the opportunity to finish a sentence.  She called due to some declines and I removed the security hold from her card and had told her 5 minutes into the 20 something minute call that her card was available for use again.  That's when she pulls out this shit:\n___________\n**M**: Me **L**: Lady\n\n**L**: Those declined transactions you mentioned earlier, did they go through or did they decline?\n\n**M**: I'm... I'm sorry, I don't think I understand what you're asking ma'am..\n\n**L**: The declined transactions, did they get charged to the card or did they decline?\n\n**M**:  I'm still not quite understanding the question ma'am.\n\n**L**:  At the beginning of the call, when you said the charges declined, does that mean that they went through or did they decline?\n\n*At this point I'm just wondering if she is even hearing herself and wondering if I'm misunderstanding what she's asking*\n\n**M**: The declined transactions declined, ma'am they--\n\n**L**: Oh okay!

We're unfortunately behind in our file processing this year (cause, y'know, budget cuts and increased inventory!)  So obviously a lot of the calls I deal with are with unhappy people.\n\nI had this lovely gem of a woman, calling on behalf of someone else, explain to me the situation.  By then I already knew I was probably going to get yelled at, because her call should not have been misdirected to me.\n\nI look into her file (unfortunately our system is stupid and there's a period of a couple of weeks before a completed file pops up on the system, this is SO FUN when dealing with angry people) and I can't say with 100% certainty that it's finished, but I've worked here long enough that I tell her that it's most likely been completed.\n\nI then tell her that the reason behind the other problem is that there was something else she was supposed to do.  (I know it's vague, but I can't go into details).\n\nWELL!!  How dare I give her information that no one else gave her???  So then she keeps going on and on about the current file, so that the other problem can be fixed, and I keep trying to tell her that, actually, this file being done won't fix the other problem.  And she just keeps talking to me like I'm the idiot, and why the hell can't I say for sure that the file has been done or not?\n\nSo I finally tell her to file a service complaint and she slams her phone.\n\nI wish I could be there to hear her receive the news that her file was, in fact, completed.  (I have a few other tricks to find things, but I only use them if people are kind to me, as they are not 100% fullproof, either).\n\nYes, lady, the entire system is ridiculous.",

        "text": "So this was cross posted to /r/talesfromtechsupport. I thought you fine folks could also appreciate this.\n\nSo I have another tale from my time as ISP technical support rep. This gem of a story comes to us back in the year 2012. I was a wet behind the ears n00b, as this was about 3 months since training had ended.\n\n\nCast of characters: \n\nMe: Your fearless n00b of a tech\n\nOiM: old ibook man, this guy should not have a computer. It should be noted that this guy sounds very frail and elderly.\n\nOT: Other tech that sat beside me\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, onto the story:\n\n\n&gt;me: hears whisper tone in my ear telling me its a city somewhere in Maine Thank you for calling ISP national help desk support, this is peopleman_at_work. So I can locate your account, please tell me your telephone number and name on the account.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: Yes its XXX-XXXX. and the name is Old ibook man.\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir as this is a national call center I need to know your area code too.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: Oh, its 11154.\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir that is your zip code, I need the numbers that proceed your telephone number, the three digit code for your area.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: Oh, its XXX, sorry about that, but in my day we didn't have all this fancy telephonic equipment.\n\n\n&gt;me: That's OK sir, what seems to be the issue today?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: I can't seem to get the website.\n\n\n&gt;me: What website sir?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: I think its G.O.O.G.L.E? *please not dear reader he actually said the periods between each letter*\n\n\n&gt;me: OK, so you can't get to google.com. I will be more then happy to assist you getting to that website. So that I can direction you, and know what browser you are using, what type of computer are you running? Is it a fruitybrand or PC?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: It says ibook? Is that a brand?\n\n\n&gt;me: Thank you sir, yes that is a fruitybrand device. Can you please move your mouse up to the upper left corner, where you see the silver apple, and select \"about this furitybrand\"? Then let me know what version of fruityOS you are running?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: It says version 10.5\n\n\n&gt;me: Ok, please close out that window, and go to the bottom, where you have the icons and click the compass(safari).\n\n\n&gt;OiM: OK, a blank page comes up.\n\n\n&gt;me: Do you see on the top anything that starts either www, or http?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: no.\n\n\n&gt;me: OK, how about a bar that says something like enter search or start search, or just a blank bar?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: I see a blank bar, want me to click it?\n\n\n&gt;me: Yes please sir.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: OK, done. Now I have something flashing up there!\n\n\n&gt;me: very good sir, now on the keyboard I want you to type google.com\n\n\n&gt;OiM: What is the keyboard, and how do I type? I don't understand this new electronic stuff. now, I am confused at this point, for the most part he has been able to use the computer just fine.\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir the keyboard will look like typewriter keys, it will be located below the screen.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: All I see below the screen is white space, and a bunch of boxes with letters on them!\n\n\n&gt;me: Those boxes are actually keys that you can press, we call those collections of keys a keyboard.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: Oh, I see, how do I use it?\n\n\n&gt;me: well, locate the 'G' key, and just tap it. Then look at your screen. A 'G' should appear in that box!\n\n\n&gt;OiM: There is no G on these keys!\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir, I assure you that there is a G listed, it should be next to the F and the H, in the middle row.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: There is nothing there!\n\n\n&gt;me: Keyboards are fairly standard sir, I know that it is there. If you are having a hard time seeing the keys, do you have a magnifying glass near by?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: NO I don't, and you should respect your elders young man! How dare you say I can't see something!!!11\n\n\n&gt;me: Im sorry if I offended you, but if you can't find the keys that we need, I won't be able to assist you.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: That's what they always say to me. If you can't find this then I can't help you. You know back in my day we had a thing called house calls. If we didn't know how to do something someone would come out and show you. I want a tech sent here right now!\n\n\n*note dear reader, it was 11PM on a Saturday, our techs stopped dispatching in his state at 5PM on a regular day, but he was in a special area that only had 1 or 2 techs, and they only went to his area on Monday's and Thursdays.*\n\n\n&gt;me: I'm sorry sir, but this is just not possible our techs in your area only come out on Monday and Thursdays. I can schedule a technician visit, but just so you are aware we charge 39.99 for the tech to show up, and for every half hour that they are there its a 60.00 charge to work on customer equipment.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! GET ME SOMEONE OUT HERE RIGHT AWAY AND FOR FREE!\n\n\n&gt;me: I can't do that sir. I do not have the power, and even if i did, I would not send someone out after 11 PM unless it was an emergency. This does not qualify.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: You know what, this is (expletive) crappy service. And you are a (expletive) poor tech.\n\n\n&gt;me: as per company policy, this is your first warning, if you swear at me two more times, I will be forced to disconnect this call. I am being professional with you, and i expect you to be the same with me.\n\n\n&gt;OiM: Oh, yeah, well (expletive) you!\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir, this is now your second warning, one more expletive and I will disconnect this call. Now, is there someone else there that could help you locate this key?\n\n\n&gt;OiM: My wife is here, but I wouldn't subject her to a (expletive) technician like yourself. You don't know how to treat people. No wonder your company is rated so piss poor in the rankings of customer service.\n\n\n&gt;me: as this is the third expletive that you used, I will now be disconnecting this call and noting the account accordingly. Thank you for calling ISP, have a good day! goes in after call\n\n\n&gt;OT: What the hell was that? I don't think in the three months you have been here I have ever heard you disconnect a call for anything even swearing.\n\n\n&gt;me: well, the customer couldn't figure out how to use the keyboard, was becoming belligerent, and started to swear at me.\n\n\n&gt;OT: what do you mean he didn't know how to use the keyboard, that is kinda basic to computers. How has he been using it?\n\n\n&gt;me: I have no idea, and don't even want to think about it.\n\n\n&gt;OT: I think you deserve a drink.\n\n\n&gt;me: me to.**sigh**\n\n\nThe real kicker here? This guy got the automated survey call. I think you can guess my score.\n\nTl;Dr: guy doesn't know how to use a keyboard, gets angry, demands a technician visit, and when told that is not possible, starts swearing at me, so I disconnect the call.",

I want compensation I cant ring anyone and nobody can ring me this is unacceptable im going to lodge a complaint and goto the ombudsman! Put me onto your supervisor!\n\nM: No sorry I cant do that. You cant get any compensation because you havent been paying us ANYTHING for the past 3 years so youre not actually a customer. We are working on restoring the phone lines in areas we can due to health and safety and will restore yours ASAP.  What I have done for you know is fixed the bug.

While speaking to this really nice woman she explains it has been a rough year and she is hoping the new year is better (jt was that week between Christmas and New Years). Unprompted by me, she begins to tell me how her house blew up a couple weeks ago. Apparently there was a gas leak and something sparked and her house blew up leaving nothing but the foundation. She goes on to tell me how she was so thankful that no one was hurt, it happened in the middle of the day and no one was home, etc. She tells me about Christmas being rough because she hosts her entire family and as such all of her siblings bring over the gifts for their children in advance (so the kids can't snoop), they all show up early Christmas morning and do open gifts and have a huge celebration. So, not only did all of the gifts for her kids go up on smoke but so did most of them for her nieces and nephews as well. Again, she expresses gratitude for no one being hurt, and homeowners insurance. She then says \"you want to hear something ridiculous?\" I say sure. She says \"I go to my house everyday to pick up the mail. That idiot mailman of mine keeps putting it in the box. She says the pizza coupons I can tolerate, they don't know any better but that damn mailman can see no one is living there! It is nothing more than a cement slab.\" Then she starts laughing, at first just a little giggle at her own funny story, then she really starts to laugh, then she says \"I just made a decision. I am gonna have everyone over, we will sit on the cement slab that used to be my house, order a pizza for delivery and celebrate the new year!\" Now, she is laughing hysterically. She manages to say between uncontrollable bouts of laughter \"It is a shame they don't deliver mail on holidays. I would love to see that idiots face as he delivers the mail.\"  She continues to laugh until her laughter turns into crying. After a few minutes she composes herself and tells me that is the first time she has shed a tear since her house blew up. She thanks me and tells me she is going to go thank her mailman as well saying \"he may be an idiot but he helped make laugh at a time when I needed it most.\" \n\nTL;DR as long as the mailbox is there, mail will be delivered![original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/5oycaz/when_something_like_911_happens_what_happens_to/)",

To give her any info, we have to verify her birthdate and the last four of her ssn. Obviously, we've had people get fussy about the ssn before, and then we just say \"welp, can't give you any info. bye.\" But this lady was a gem.\n\nShe refuses to give my coworker her *birthdate*. The social was fine, but she refused that part. When my coworker tells her that she can't give any info on the account, this woman starts screaming at her for several minutes about us asking her \"private questions in a public place\" bitch like we control where you call from. She goes on and on that our policy is \"ludicrous\" and then just hangs up, only to call back four different times and yell at four different associates about the exact same thing. \"Why do you people keep asking me this?!\" \n\nEventually my other coworker just gets her to a supervisor (she stayed on the line long enough for us to) and the woman turns all nice and is like \"Oh I was in the registrar's office and there were other students there. I didn't want them to know my age; it's embarrassing.\"\n\n1. Lady, as the typical 21-year-old college kid, I promise you, I couldn't give less of a shit about your age. \n\n2.

I would judge someone I saw yelling at a customer service employee more than I would judge someone born in 1966 (which is... ancient...?

        "text": "I work in a call center (duh) running T1 support for our...\"sales\" department at a larger automotive company. They constantly fuck things up. They never provide the correct information. They always do the absolute least &lt;- when this comes back to haunt them, they always foist it off on us support staff. \n\nToday I was making credentials for a new sale on our tech training program and noticed that there were 5 people set up to receive credentials. Now, when the program is set up, we are only allowed to set up 4. To access another user, the customer has to sign up for another user. Pretty standard procedure. Pay an extra fee, get an extra seat kinda thing. Now, as a courtesy - we *USED* to offer setting up an admin only set of credentials, where they admin could only see what their techs were doing in this particular program - but not take any of the courses. Basically a ghost user. The company has since changed the way that the program operates, and now the admin is just the main user. Has all of the same functionality - but can now take courses. Effectively a full user. This is included with the cost, and is included with the 4 users. I get a case in my world today with 5 users and got into a rather foul mood, because this particular sales rep **KNOWS** that they need separate emails for each of the users. The account set up not only has 5 users, which he promised this shop an additional one for free because they would sign up right away, but also provided the EXACT. SAME. EMAIL. ADDRESS. for every one of their technicians. Our program has to have the email verified for it to work. It creates a unique token and matches it to the email address attached to the user. \n\nI let my manager know, and he said that I should write an email to the sales rep explaining that we do not offer the extra user as a courtesy anymore. So, I write the email, and he responds with \"Well, I already told him that we could get him the extra user for free - so you're going to have to fix it because I'm not calling him back and ruining my sale. He said that if he likes the program, he would sign for an annual contract. I'm not jeopardizing my bonus because of some stupid rule.\"\n\n**UPDATE** So, I reported it to my manager, who reported it to the Director (who used to be in Sales) - and it actually got fixed. I called the customer and let him know during the training that we do not provide the additional user anymore because of individuals abusing this policy, and the customer totally understood - however, he cancelled his enrollment and asked to be transferred to the sales rep. Customer didn't sound too happy (thankfully not with me, there were lots of fucks, pieces of shit, and garbage ass sales guy thrown around). The Director of the call center sat him down and explained that if this particular scenario happens again, he will be terminated. It was particularly offensive to the director because he was CC'd on the infamous email haha.",

Of these three, one of them was a jet-ski that he had sold -- 3 YEARS AGO. He was calling because he had purchased a new one and wanted to add it to his policy.\n\nIn the back of my mind, here I am thinking 'ok, buddy, you receive documents EVERY YEAR outlining what units we are insuring and outlining coverage for each unit. How are you just now noticing this??' \n\nSo I get all of the information for the new jet-ski and while I'm processing that the whole time he is thinking aloud about \"how did I miss that?\" and \"Can I get a refund for those 3 years? Hardy-har\"\n\nThankfully he was good-natured about it. I'd hate to have dealt with him if he was actually serious about trying to get 3 years worth of refunds. We got the new unit added and got him on his way.\n\nI had a pretty good laugh about that after the call ended.",

We had to verify **every.single.customer** no matter what before we discussed about or did *anything* on their account. Fail this, and you get a mark on your record. Continue it and you see the door. \n\nSo there I am having come back from my second break~~fast~~ and take a call from an initially sweet middle aged woman. For the purpose of this post I will call her, Dorothy.\n\n&gt; [Me] Hello, intelligenceissexy speaking. How can I help today?\n\nRather frantically,\n\n&gt; [Dorothy] Hi I just need to send this money into my friends account. I'm out at the moment. Can you do it for me?\n\n&gt; [Me] Sure, that's not a problem at all. Firstly, however, I do need to carry out some security to verify yourself. Shouldn't take two minutes. \n\n&gt; [Dorothy] (*sigh*) okay then. Just hurry up about it!\n\nSo I begin to proceed to ask the questions that need to be answered and only the customer would know. As you can imagine, Dorothy doesn't like this very much. In fact not at all.\n\n&gt; [Dorothy] Why are you asking for so many personal details? Is this how you treat your customers?! I want your manager on the line. NOW!! I've been with you for almost 20 years!\n\n*Facepalm/headdesk* \"What?\" I say to myself. \n\nI knew she hadn't been with us for that long. Because when a customer calls they have to enter some details about their account before talking to us.^(sort code/card no. etc etc) And if she had been with us for that long then she'd know this is what we do for verification. As a result I could see the info we hold on her. I wasn't in the mood to deal with this \"I'm the customer. YOU listen to me\" sort of behaviour.\n\nNow we had a specific department to deal with customers that want to speak to a manager. These people weren't managers per se but acted as one in cases like this. They were going to ask exactly the same questions I was. If she had just answered what I was asking we'd have finished by this point. \n\n&gt; [Me] I can do that for you. I'd just like you to know that the manager is going to ask you the same questions as myself, as I have been unable to verify you.\n\n&gt;  [Dorothy] Yeah, we'll see wont we?!\n\nWith that remark out of her system, I fobbed her off to the other department, and took my time detailing my encounter with her on her account profile so my actual manager could see that I had done everything correctly. \n\n\n",

        "text": "Fellow redditor told me to post my story here. Before I do here's a little background:\n\nOver 10 years ago, and imagine a boiler-roomesque zombie debt collection agency. (At the time I was pretty naive and just excited to put money in my pockets)\n\nMy first job ever was at a call center. I go in the first day and meet my trainer, we will call him Zach. He gives me a quick tour of the place then shows me his desk and my desk right next to it. I noticed a line of white powder on his desk but said nothing, just focused on my first job. We get logged in and almost ready to start taking phone calls when Zach says hey you're going to need this first and proceeds to crush up a pill and line it up on my desk. I decline multiple times, so it remains there even after he rails his own line. I take my first couple calls (imagine boiler room but I was young and naive) within a few minutes, I get my first payment. The floor manager comes over to congratulate me, she notices the line but says nothing about it. My trainer proceeds to show me where the paperwork goes so we walk over and place it in the basket. Upon walking back the floor manager is rubbing her nose and the line is gone!\n\nNeed I remind you, this is my first day at any job, 17 fresh out of high school, clean cut kid that only smoked and drank at some parties.\n\nAround lunch time they announce a $500 bonus for the largest payment by the end of the day, minimum $1500.\n\nEveryone is going thru all their accounts over $1500 without much success. Most phone numbers listed were incorrect and they had no skiptracing software at the time. I decided to go after the biggest accounts I had access to and work down. I get a guy on the phone and he makes a $3000 payment! This was maybe 20 min before closing time. I get real excited after this and go to turn in the paperwork, the owner happens to be standing by the basket.\n\nHe looks at me very angrily and tells me to come with him. I follow thinking we are going to his office, instead we head down a stairway to the back alley. I'm half shitting my pants at this point thinking back to the drugs already and wondering what I got myself into. His fancy SUV is out there and tells me to get in. I ask where we're going and get no response. At this point I'm trying to remember directions and any road signs I see (imagine taken or taken 2 or taken 3). We get about 4 blocks away when a familiar smell starts wafting about, ahhh marijuana, I take some hits thinking they might be my last. We pull up to another back alley with a couple parking spots and he tells me to stay there. So I do.\n\nIt feels like an eternity before he comes back. Multiple times I thought of bailing and running back for my car. He then comes around the corner and hops back in his car, says absolutely nothing to me. He drives back to work, again saying nothing just listening to the radio. He pulls into the employee parking lot then next to my car. He hands me an envelope with $500 in it (completely forgot the bonus by now, between weed an thinking I was going to die.) Says hope you had a good first day and drives off.\n\nGotta love call centers haha.\n\nThis very much set the tone for the next year of employment. I made great money but it was absolutely batshit crazy. The company eventually went under, yet he created new ones doing the same thing under new names multiple times.\n\nOne day I may try to write out all the stories I have from the place.\n\nI.e. manager giving me shrooms while at work (not a pill guy but shrouds I was willing to try)\n\nOffice party with stripper bartenders and open bar\n\nOwner getting arrested by bounty hunter from former coworker posing as a super sexy chick trying to bang him after he bounced out on paying people and taxes",

I opened it and found an empty plastic bag, a weird Keychain with a scraper, a tiny spoon, and a hollow needle shaped thingy. Oh and a loaded syringe. Seeing as how I was in full view of reception I picked it up and took it to the front desk. I told them I found drugs in front of the door, and our head IT guy who was there asked to take a look. He was a cop for 12 years. Confirming it was drugs he told reception to call the police and had me sit in the waiting room. Now I have to miss a training to talk to the police, and get drug tested. Like I accidentally dropped my rig and played it off as \"finding\" it. Whatever we have cameras and if they accuse me one more time I'll sue.  \n\nUpdate: I am back in my boring ass training class for switching projects. I am not in any trouble but I have been asked to not talk about the incident with coworkers. They did figure out who dropped the drugs but wouldn't tell me who it was. (I suspect the night cleaning crew.) The cops were nice. I had a drug test for my mbi background check last week so I didn't have to again, and the cops pretty much took that and the video as proof I was telling the truth. All told fun day.

It involved co-workers not a customer and oddly enough isn't about anything horrible just humorous. \n\nThis account was with a credit card company so not only did you need a badge to get into the building but you had to badge into the individual section of the building that housed your particular market. The set up was two doors you could enter through that had automatic door closers as well as one additional door that you could only exit through (probably fire code reasons). You would set off an alarm if you didn't manually close this third exit door so we all pretty much had made it a habit to reach behind yourself and manually close it.\n\nSo that's the back story on to the event.   Three ladies of about my age (late forties) were walking in front of me and we're pretty involved in their conversation and I guess didn't notice me being a few steps behind them.  They reach the door and exit, still involved in their conversation.  The last one through the door reached back with out looking to shut the door.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) instead of grabbing the door she perfectly grabbed me by the crotch. Now we all have those moments when you later think about the perfect thing to say in a situation but this time it was right then.  Despite my surprise I blurted out \"that's not a doorknob\".  She was mortified,  I was somewhat embarrassed but the story made the rounds and that is how I was called doorknob by my co-workers for the next year.",

        "text": "I take calls for a large utility company. As those of you who work in billing departments already know, an account balance increases when we add charges (when your power bill comes out), and decreases when the customer makes a payment. A negative balance indicates a credit balance, or money the company owes you. I've been taking ~500 calls per week for about two years now and I've experienced a *lot* of stupidity, but this story is about the dumbest of them all. The interaction happened as follows:  \n  \n**Me**: Good morning, this is /u/Heisenberg747  \n**Cust**: Uh yeah, every time I make a payment, my bill doubles.  \n**Me**: I'm sorry, you said what now? (I was already confused at this point. The cust was also very incoherent, and sounds like he spent most of his childhood eating paint chips)  \n**Cust**: I was trying to pay my bill online and it's saying I owe more than I did before I made a payment.  \n**Me**: I'm sorry to hear that, I would be happy to find out what's going on, one moment while I take a look through the account...  \n  \nBefore today, the account was in a credit balance of about $300, and the cust's bill had just dropped, removing about $150 of the cust's credit, remaining credit balance -$150. This also means the customer just received a bill showing the -$150 credit balance and thought that was a charge. It happens from time to time, despite the giant bold letters next to the account balance that say **CREDIT BALANCE - DO NOT PAY**. Sure enough, there are pending payments that haven't been posted yet. Over $1000 worth of payments were made in the last few hours. Hopefully the cust was just trying to prepay his account... Hopefully...  \n  \n**Me**: Sir, it looks like there is a pending payment of over $1000, but the account was already in a credit balance. Were you trying to prepay your account?  \n**Cust**: No, your website sucks donkey balls! I got my bill and it says I owe $150, so I made a payment. Then it says I owed $300, so I made another payment. I keep trying to make a payment, but the amount it says I owe keeps going up and up... Donkey balls... Hire a lawyer.... Channel 12 News... Blah Blah Blah.  \n  \nFuck, you try to hold on to a little faith in humanity, and look what happens: you get retards calling in trying to pay off a credit balance... Well, here we go:  \n  \n**Me**: Sir, what you saw on the bill was a credit balance, you don't owe us anything. That's why the number kept increas...  \n**Cust**: NO!! I WAS JUST TRYING TO PAY blaah blah blah utilities commission blah blah blah...  \n**Me**: Sir do you have your bill in front of you?  \n**Cust**: Yes...  \n**Me**: Do you see how the number in the \"amount owed\" box is negative? That means it's a credit, not a charge.  \n**Cust**: WELL HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT???!!!  \n**Me**: Do you see the part *next* to the amount due that says **CREDIT BALANCE - DO NOT PAY**? It was clearly marked. When you paid the first time, it increased the amount of credit you have. That's why the number in the \"amount due\" box kept going up every time you made a payment, because with each payment you were increasing the amount of money we owe you.  \n**Cust**: Well I need that money back, I have to pay rent.  \n**Me**: I'm not able to cancel the payments at this time, your requests have already been sent to your financial institution for processing. At this point all I can do is issue a refund check. It will have to be sent through the mail, and cannot be sent out until your payment actually clears the bank.  \n**Cust**: Well can you transfer the credit to my landlord or to my cable or gas company?  \n**Me**: No...  \n**Cust**: Well you need to call my landlord and explain why I won't be paying rent this month.  \n**Me**: I'm sorry, I'm unable to make outbound calls. I'd be happy to give you a statement showing your large credit balance, if you think that will help back up your story, but you authorized those payments. Each time you made a payment, you had to click through 2 sets of warning boxes to actually submit those payments. At this point, all that can be done is to issue a refund check or to have the bank stop the payment. The former will take 3-6 weeks, and the latter will cost you around $60.  \n  \nThe cust freaks out while I try to convince him to either stop payment or let me send a refund check. Either will take longer than this cust was willing to wait, best get the ball rolling as early as possible. The cust wasn't having any of that, he just kept screaming like a small child and eventually hung up the phone. I don't understand people like this. If this idiot had taken the time to *read the words in front of his face*, he would have been fine. Now, best case scenario, he pays $40 for a stop payment fee and the subsequent $20 returned check fee we will charge once the bank declines to submit the funds. Oh well, I guess that's what's known as the \"Idiot Tax\".  \n  \n**TLDR**: Guy thinks his credit balance is the amount of money he owes and pays it. Over and over again.  \n**E**: Formatting",

        "text": "Hi all, so I work at a call center selling auto and fire insurance and if I have one pet peeve it's the customers who actually get MAD that we won't lie on our insurance applications for them.\n\nNOTE: Simple rule of thumb, if you are one of the legally titled owners of a car, you MUST be listed on the policy as an owner and as a driver. I mean, this makes perfect sense when you think about it, if you own a car you can legally take it and drive it whenever you want...\n\nSo I get a call that goes as follows. SM is stupid mom and SD is stupid daughter:\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you for calling &lt;Insurance Company&gt; my name is Bibo how can I help you?\n\n&gt; SM: Hi I want to add a car to my policy.\n\n&gt; Me: Oh great, I would be glad to help you out with that. Who will drive it?\n\n&gt; SM: My daughter.\n\n&gt; Me: Awesome. Who will be the titled owner?\n\n&gt; SM: She will, we're both at the dealer now.\n\n&gt; Me: Awesome well tell her congratulations for me! Now I do want to let you know that since she as an owner her name will also need to be on the policy and I'll need to speak with her before I get it started.\n\n&gt; SM: Oh we already got a quote in her name, I just want to know if it will be cheaper under my name.\n\n(Uhh what? I look for the quote to try to see what is on it and it is not in the system, neither in her or her daughter's names)\n\n&gt; Me: Ah I see, are you going to drive the car?\n\n&gt; SM: No.\n\n&gt; Me: Are you helping her buy it? Will you be a registered owner?\n\n&gt; SM: No.\n\nNOTE: Was she is asking me to do is write an insurance policy in her name on a car that belongs to someone else. This is fraud. I mean, this would potentially let her collect an insurance payment if something happened to a car she spent *no money on*\n\n&gt; Me: Oh okay, well I can list you on the policy with SD's consent but her name will have to be on no matter what.\n\n&gt; SM: Okay do it (Doesn't seem to be listening).\n\n&gt; Me: Okay I'll need to talk to SD now.\n\n(I gather all the car info, driving info, etc...)\n\n&gt; Me: Okay your quote is (higher than free)\n\n&gt; SD: WHAT!? That's more than when I got a quote in my name.\n\n&gt; Me: Ah, well I did not see any quote in our system in your name, but I can assure you whatever you quote you received must not have had all the right info.\n\n(SD hands the phone to mommy)\n\n&gt; SM: Hey why is it so expensive?\n\n&gt; Me: (Because your stupid daughter just got her license and now she's buying a brand new car, why do you think?) Ah, well I could not locate the quote you said SD got but it must not have had all the right information on that quote, I assure you I have asked all necessary questions.\n\n&gt; SM: You did this quote in my name right?\n\n&gt; Me: Well I have you listed but like I said SD's name will have to-\n\n&gt; SM: Oh my god unbelievable, I TOLD you I wanted this to be in MY name blah blah blah blah.\n\n&gt; Me: (While I want better job where I wouldn't need to talk to your stupid ass) Well we require all owners be named insureds.\n\n&gt; SM: You have not done anything I told you to this whole time. Your quote is more than when we got the quote in her name alone (still have no idea what she is talking about). I will call my agent and do it there. Just hang up so I can do the survey on you (we don't do surveys in my call center we have quality monitoring).\n\nI tried to explain why she was being a moron and asking me to basically commit fraud for her and she hung up on me. The unfortunate thing is, independent agents will often fudge the info on applications to get a lower price for more sales, so they may very well have just done the whole thing in her name =/",

        "text": "Hi TFCC, I don't work in a call center, but I enjoy reading your stories. If this is appropriate, I'd like to share a tale from the other side of the phone.\n\nMaybe 15 years ago, we started getting calls from a \"pharmacy\" wanting to talk to Phyllis and sell her whatever medication we're guessing she had ordered from an unscrupulous online pharmacy and supplied our phone number as hers. There is (and had not been for years, if ever) a Phyllis living at our address.  We live in the US, so I'm pretty sure the medications they were selling were supposed to be prescribed by a doctor, so they were illegally soliciting drugs, probably from another country (India, if I had to guess by their accents).\n\nWe initially let them know there was no Phyllis at our number and asked to be taken off of their list. Repeatedly. But they kept calling. Sometimes it would be as often as once a week, other times we would go months without getting a call for Phyllis. It kind of became an ongoing joke, although we grew tired of repeatedly requesting to be taken off of their list.\n\nThat's when we had to try different tactics. My dad, in his dad-comedy, would answer their calls (we'd recognize the numbers on caller ID) in different character voices, ultimately wasting their time by asking about every product they sell and not buying anything, by changing the subject and talking about obscure movies/music/culture references (they'd pretend to know what he was talking about to try to get the sale, by pretending to be a child or mentally handicapped adult (I remember once, in the middle of a sentence, he stopped, and, with an utterly dejected tone, said \"my peanut butter toast melted...\"), and probably everything else many of you have experienced. Sometimes he'd ask about the caller, where they were from, etc. and they'd lie (one, in a particularly thick Indian accent, claimed his last name was O'Connor and that he lived in Boston).\n\nAt times of particular frustration, we tried anger, yelling about how many times we had requested them to lose our number, cursing their existence for calling us at hours from dinner time to as late as 1 or 2am. Another idea we had was to tell them Phyllis had died and that she wouldn't be needing any more medications. Still, they called. Even after being berated for continuing to call us after our dearly beloved Phyllis's passing, they would promise to take us off their list and did not.  \n\nAs I remember, we finally got them to stop calling us, not by having us taken off their list, but by telling them that Phyllis had moved and by giving them her \"new number\" to replace ours with in their system. Three times.\n\nI know at times our behavior was the stuff of some of your horror stories, but over the course of our 3-4 years of harassment from these assholes, I hope you'll understand it was all we could do to keep our sanity. And it was their fault for not taking us off of their fucking list. \n\n\n\nHave you guys ever had terrible call center experiences from the other side of the phone (your home, cell, etc)?",

This actually happened a few months back so I'm paraphrasing in places.\n\n**Me:** Service Desk...\n\n**Caller:** My work has gone!\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry to hear that, what was it you had been working on?\n\n**Caller:** A Word document. You need to fix this right now!\n\n**Me:** Okay, do you mind explaining exactly what happened?\n\n**Caller:** I was working on a project proposal due tomorrow, I shutdown my computer and went out to lunch, when I came back I turned the computer back on and now the work has gone!\n\n**Me:** Okay, so I'm assuming you saved this before shutting the PC down? Perhaps we can simply open it again from the save location...\n\n**Caller:** What do you mean *save my work*? I have to safe stuff myself?\n\n**Me:** Well, yes. Normally you save things before leaving the PC or generally we recommend hitting save every half an hour incase the PC crashes\n\n**Caller:** This is the first time anyone has mentioned that I have to save my own work!\n\n**Me:** You always have to save your work I'm afraid. Let me see if I can remote in and check a few things out for you.\n\n*gets remotely connected*\n\n**Me:** Unfortunately I don't think I can recover this. I've had a quick look for any AutoRecover files however I haven't been able to find any. I'm afraid the work is lost.\n\n**Caller:** But it should save itself! I usually work on Google docs at home and I never have to save things myself! What kind of system is this!\n\n**Me:** I can see how you'd be a little confused. Google Docs is a web based editor and saves things automatically for you. We use Microsoft Office which unfortunately doesn't yet have this capability - you need to manually saver your work else this situation will occur.\n\n**Caller:** FINE I'll just let my manager know that IT are USELESS *click*\n\nTurns out &lt;caller&gt; had actually never used Microsoft Office before yet for some reason agreed to create a project proposal for the department she worked for (who's systems are primarily a web based data entry platform so they generally have no need to use Microsoft Office anyway). Manager was understanding in the end and didn't kick up a fuss. From what I gather &lt;caller&gt; has been scheduled for IT basics training.",

Another call I remember was trying to locate a woman in a rural country area, I was probing her trying to find out where her vehicle is and she was upset because she was having to ask oncoming cars for help. She even went so far as to blame me for the situation, saying \"if she gets hurt, it's MY fault.\" I've also had a call where I was trying to find out the clearance on a parking garage because this woman needed a tow and she couldn't even tell me what it was and after a while of looking, I informed her that I would have a difficult time finding service for her because of the unknown parking garage clearance and she said she had it! She blamed me stating all this time was wasted because of my idiocy when I asked her earlier if she knew what it was and she said NO. So I'm curious to know what other interesting calls have occurred in the roadside assistance department.",

        "text": "So, I am currently working in a call center for  a healthcare company in the doctor referral line where we basically are giving the callers the names of Doctors that are taking new patients. \n\nI had someone call in, who has been calling quite a bit to get the names of different doctors even though the list hasn't changed since the last time she called. \n\nAnyway, she starts off with that she will need her doctor to be 2 miles or less from her. Fair enough.\n\nThe she says she will only see a male doctor because female doctors have children which distract them from \"science\". And her doctor can't have a \"foreign\" last name because they don't understand the \"American way.\" Those Indian doctors are \"mean\" and the arabic doctors secretly pray to ISIS.\n\nShe then lists off doctors that we already gave her that she decided she didnt want for whatever reason, that gave me 2 doctors to give her that were left in my database. One of them had an Italian name, which she asked if he was a foreigner and I told her I couldn't tell, but the name is Italian. She passed.\n\n Gave her the other one, which was a \"John Smith\" type name. She quickly asked if the doctor was Caucasian and I told her I didn't have his picture and couldn't tell, since we don't have a need to put in their skin color into the database. She starts to defend herself that the \"world\" is the problem and ever since that \"mess\" happened in Charlottesville she has to protect herself from non Caucasian, and it is just the world we live in now. \n\nShe then brought up a name that a previous person gave her, which was another \"John Smith \" type name and asked if he was still pulling up. I told her yes, but I didn't give it out since she said she already had his info. She then advised me that she tried to get an appointment with that doctor, but he isn't taking new Medicare patients. \n\nShe then went on a 5 minute rant of how this doctor is discriminating against Medicare patients for putting a cap on how many Medicare patients he takes and yelled \"that's discrimination\"\n\nThe woman who discriminated against women, Arabs, indians, blacks, Italians all in the same phone call was crying that she was discriminated against.\n\n",

        "text": "So the day I've waited for for so long has finally arrived... my last day in the call center!\n\nI've been fortunate to have a lot of stat days off recently so the last couple of weeks I've only been working 3 days per week each. At this stage, after the crazy busyness I had to endure last year and with the Christmas period happening, my mind was already switching off into holiday mode. When I was at work I was already basically imagining myself on the beach, sipping a cold one so my attitude over the last few days was even more \"Can't be arsed\" than usual.\n\nMy last call of the day on Friday just before 5 o clock was somebody wanting to speak with a bylaws officer as they own a stall by the beach and some buskers had showed up playing electric guitars. When I explained no bylaws officers were available at 5pm he said \"Nevermind then - I'll just go punch them out!\" And then that was it - he hung up and that was my last call! The nature of the call was quite fitting to be my last one as that was the sort of stuff I was listening to day in, day out for the last two years.\n\nOver the last two years I've heard every kind of complaint you can think of, been sworn at on multiple occasions, called \"hopeless\" by some stupid woman who didn't even know her own street name, been yelled at because other people don't answer their phones in other departments and been horrendously overworked (the worst day was when we were answering calls for another government department as well as our own when we didn't even have enough staff for our own department - I remember on that day answering 40 phone calls in one hour). So, needless to say, I'm over it and have been for some time.\n\nI've got an internal promotion to another department which begins towards the end of January. It didn't really sink in when I finished on Friday but today it really hit me that my time there is up as I'm taking two weeks leave before I start my new role. Instead of getting up and commuting to get an early parking spot so I can get ready for a typically busy Monday (which will be even worse today as all of the businesses are starting up again) I got to sleep pretty much the whole day. It was bliss!\n\nI'm just so glad it's over. No more ringing phones, barking dog complaints, people moaning that other departments don't get back to them, no more blowouts on the queue when 20 people decide to phone at once and then get annoyed when we don't answer in minus one second, and no more talking myself to death all day and coming home with no energy to talk to anyone in my household.\n\nUltimately I am grateful for the experience I had there as it did me a lot of good and helped me to grow a lot as a person and made me a lot bolder in terms of dealing with people. But I have realized that call center agents have an expiry date and mine was well and truly up. Looking forward to two weeks of R&amp;R and a new, more advanced role to walk into once I go back to work.\n\nCheers all\n\nDL",

        "text": "So I've been working for a call center that supplys technical support to a world wide finger licking fuck fest of a fast food chain for about 8 months now and I gotta say, its been a shit, shit ride. \n\nI snagged the job up pretty quick because at the time I was out of work for 4 months and needed the money pretty desperately at this point. I was excited to have a job again at first and was eager to perform well but now I just feel hollow and dead inside without sounding like I'm joking. \n\nNow I just feel like shit every morning I wake up, I already suffer from chronic depression but this place has shot it into over drive in recent weeks. I can only blame myself in ways for this but my health has gone to shit physically too, I used to be physically fit but now I have put on 30lbs and I've been drinking far too much and far too often. \n\nThere's so many reasons why I consider throwing myself from the 3rd floor window every day so I'll just list a few:\n\n. Shitty management: This seems to be a recurring theme in call centers but these guys are a whole different story. Completely spineless cunts who will never protect the worker over the customer and will always give into their demands.\n\n. Favouritsm: Our managers have their favourites and I am not one of them despite performing well, our managers will often pick certain employees to get benefits that the others don't get such as longer lunches, letting them sit there on their phones and letting them shout at other agents to take phone calls when our contract physically says they are not allowed to do that unless they are a manager. \n\n. Shitty training: We were meant to be getting 4 weeks training but nope, was thrown on the phones in 6 days with next to no knowledge on how to resolve issues.\n\n. Toxic coworkers: Honestly the most toxic people I have ever worked with have been in this job. Constantly bitching about others, shouting and swearing at each other and just making it an office politics based environment. \n\n . The customers: This goes without saying but the customers are the worst bit of the job. Now I know as retail workers our customers get abuse from other members of the general public but the way they speak to us as a result makes me lose all sympathy for them. I have not visited any of this companies stores in 7 months as a result. It bothers me so much that these people think that because they are on the phone to someone they can speak to us like we're just monkeys with a head set on. \n\nFuck this job man.",

        "text": "I have worked in several outsourced call centers for major credit card companies in a variety of positions.   This story is about a two year period as a rewards specialist.   \n\nNow this is an area that credit card companies want their best agents because it is one area that usually leaves the customer with a good impression of the card. Usually they are calling because they are planning a major vacation or have just returned from one.  Because of this the companies will assign their best customer service agents as well as some of their most experienced agents.  Because of this experience we could handle pretty much any call other than fraud or retention cases.  \n\nNow retention is the company trying to talk a customer out of closing their accounts and the customers accounts would be marked as retain able (essentially heavy users and regular payers) and these calls would be transfered to another group. Other accounts would be marked as non retain able and we in the rewards department could close those without attempting to keep them with the company (little usage on the accounts,  poor payment history).  \n\nWithin a week of my start in this group I received a call from an account holder that was non-retainable.  This lady was in her fifties, asking to close her account so I began the process.   The final step was to ask if she would like to pay her remaining balance at that point or just continue to make her monthly payments without the ability to continue using the card for new charges.\n\nThis is the point where I learned the apparently genius secret.   \"Why would I have to pay the remaining balance\" she asks, \"I'm closing the account\". My brain did a minor hick up as I pondered this comment.  I could get my mind around a 19 or 20 year old asking this, I could even grasp the idea of someone older with their first card but surely not a middle aged,  homeowner with an extensive credit background.   Yep, in her mind this was how it worked.  Some discussion ensued and she finally grasped that closing the account didn't magical erase the debt.  Problem solved, a few laughs were exchanged with my co-workers and life went on.\n\nUntil the next week when I got another call just like it and the next month and the next month, etc for the following two years.\n\nAll these 55 years of my life and somehow I had been missing out on this financial windfall that could have been falling into my lap /s.",
