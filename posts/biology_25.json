I know I still have enough time to think about what to major in college but I at least wanna plan most of the thing when I have time. All I want is get involved in anything related to animals. (like Im not interested in Med or anything related to humans AT ALL.) The reason why I was thinking of bio major is because it has more wider opportunities I can get..?? At least that’s what I thought. But I saw some comments here saying about not recommending bio unless I wanna study for med. Im an international student who is currently studying in usa I am not a citizen of usa(thinking of getting it after I go to college) so Im already paying so much money just to study in the states. I don’t wanna end up not getting a job just because of way too less opportunities to get involved in such things. So my question is, Would you recommend me bio major? Or something else like wildlife bio, ecology, zoology, etc? I’d appreciate it if you could advice specifically about the major!",

I'm basically curious if anyone knows of any life science careers or degrees (2 year) that (preferably) isn't a technician program. I might be asking for too much- I realize that science is inherently tied to academia, and I might not be able to go very far without a bachelor's or graduate degree.

Came across an interesting discussion on another sub (sterilization of microorganisms on food):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10qplxm/til_in_1962_a_10_year_old_found_a_radioactive/j6rq0c1/\n\nMaybe someone can provide more insight, specifically in regards to the question what happens inside fruits and veggies after harvest. And how does radiation impact that? Considering potentially different stages after a fruit or veggie has been removed from its plant, is there still an ongoing activity until decay sets in?\n\nFor example, if I have an apple still attached to a tree vs. one freshly picked vs. one that was exposed to radiation vs. one that has just been sitting around for a few weeks (no treatment), would there be any major differences when it comes to cell activity? Would one be considered \"dead\" while the other is still more \"active\"? \n\nAnd something like potatoes, how are they different on a cellular level that they can continue sprouting while e.g. an apple might not be able to, despite having seeds inside? Is this the result of the sterilization process?\n\nAssuming cell activity does not instantly stop after food was harvested, how long would that continue until cell activity slows down and stops entirely? Maybe there are also changes in activity, e.g. some apples start to build up some sort of wax layer? Is that basically an immune response to fight off microorganisms?",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am a student with a deep passion for the sciences, especially molecular sciences and have been developing a proposal to study the specificity and affinity of LPA binding to ORX. Recent studies have suggested that LPAs may act as endogenous ligands for certain orphan receptors, including ORX, but the specifics of this binding have not been fully characterized yet.\n\nI am excited to dive deeper into this topic and I was wondering if any of my fellow bio/chem/biochem students and/or graduate student in these areas would be interested in joining me in this pursuit? We will be identifying the LPA subtypes that bind to ORX, determining the affinity of LPA binding to ORX, investigating the specificity of LPA binding to ORX, and studying the functional consequences of LPA binding to ORX.\n\nIf this sounds like something you would be interested in, I have attached a more detailed proposal below for your reference. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or are interested in joining the project!\n\nBest,\n\nNick\n\nLink: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AuHYbD9Dn0cDdibr21JSc16UHakMj18mRnBWbLIaLTU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AuHYbD9Dn0cDdibr21JSc16UHakMj18mRnBWbLIaLTU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Which is from the bing bang theory IIRC. \n\nAnd maybe something I could 3d in print to it?\n\nThanks in advance:)",
