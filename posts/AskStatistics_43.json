        "text": "I have an addin for MS Excel that performs a PCA on a range of data and plots the results. This add-in no longer works, and is no longer supported by the developer, so I'm working on doing it myself \"manually\".  \n\nSo far, I can tell that it is taking the data, and creating the correlation matrix. Then it is finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that correlation.  \n\nMy first question is regarding the eigenvalues. The add-in displays the eigenvalue for each component, but the values appear to be the eigenvalue that I have calculated, multiplied by the number of data points, and divided by the number of variables. Is there a reason the correlation matrix might be multiplied by this scalar before calculating the eigenvalues?  \n\nThe add-in is choosing to use only a subset of the total number of components; the ones that are used all have an eigenvalue greater than 1 (after multiplying by the above scalar). Is this a general rule of thumb, to only choose components with eigenvalue&gt;1?  The breakoff point also is where the cumulative r^2 is 99% and the cumulative Q^2 is 90%. Are these more meaningful places to determine which components are best to keep? What exactly is Q^2 ?\n\nFinally, the add-in calculates the Loading Factors. I used the procedure outlined by [NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section5/pmc552.htm). I verified that the final Score produced by the addin is, in fact, the data multiplied by the loading matrix that the addin displays. However, the loading matrix that it produces is almost exactly the eigenvector matrix, but with some of the columns having the reversed sign. Oddly, the sum of the squares of each column in this loading matrix are all 1, while my calculated loading matrix does not have sumsq=1.\n\nTo produce a loading factor matrix from a subset of the total number of components, I assume I multipy the eigenvector matrix, using only the columns of interest, by the L^-1/2 matrix, produced from the eigenvalues of interest. Correct?\n\nThanks for any help!",

Now that I have my data Iâ€™m not sure of what I had planned is ideal.\n\nBasically, itâ€™s a pre-post test design with an IV of two levels (treatment and control) and pre-post test scores for TWO separate measures (each measuring a different thing related to student success). At first i was thinking a manova, but now Iâ€™m not sure.\n\nJust to give you more info, basically I tested to see how well an intervention worked to increase student conceptual understanding of conservation of matter. Understanding of the topic was the first pre and post test assessment. I also measured student logical thinking ability as a second DV, since research says that it is highly correlated to conceptual understanding of conservation. Therefore, I administered a pre and post test for logical thinking ability as well. Both measures are interval scales.\n\nMy issue resides in how to handle analysis including these two measures in a pretest-posttest design. In education, ANCOVAs are generally performed which allow you to control for the pre test scores by inserting it as a covariate. How would you suggest i go about it if I pursue the MANOVA Route? Just compute a gain difference score for each measure as the two DVs or try to conduct a MANCOVA?\n\nThanks so much.",

It is very helpful for us to be able to predict the total number of applications for this year, based on current trends.  \n\nCan you help me think through some ways to predict the total number of applications?  \n\nHere is the data that we have.  For the last 3 years, we have application data for each date from September - April.   This consists of how many applications per day we received that day.  (e.g. Day 10: 20 applications, Day 11: 15 applications...Day 155:20).   We also have this data for this year up until yesterday, so we know how many applications total we have so far this year, and also this year's average application rate.    I would like to predict the totals about 45 days in the future.\n\nI have tried a few techniques to predict.  One technique I tried is to do a regression using days as my predictor variable, and daily application number as my predicted variable.   This seems okay, but I won't know until we get the total.\n\nOne thing I would like to do is incorporate past years analysis, but I can't figure out how.   Each year we have a pretty similar application trend - application rates start out slowly, pick up in November, slow down again, and then pick up again in Feb - March (so the rate changes).  This seems fairly consistent from year to year.   What is different is the average application rate from year to year.   For whatever reason, we are more popular some years, and less popular other years, and this affects our average applications per day.\n\nIs there anyway to use past years data, and then incorporate this year's application rate?  Or any other ideas that you have for predicting, I would be happy to help.  Many thanks!",

These numbers are totals from an actual classroom exercise.\n\nSuppose I flip a fair coin 2660 times and get heads 1181 times.  Since this is a binomial random variable, the standard deviation is sqrt(2660(.5)(1-.5)) = 25.79, so the z-score is -.002, which gives essentially a 50% chance of this (or fewer heads) occurring. This seems fine to me.\n\nConsider the problem now as a hypothesis test.  Assume that the coin is fair, so p0 = .5.  For my test, I flip it 2660 times and get a proportion of 1181/2660 = .444.  The test statistic is (.444-.5)/sqrt(.5(1-.5)/2660) = -5.78.  This test statistic gives a P-value of essentially 0, which is obviously less than any significance level. So I have to reject that the coin is fair, even though I had a ~50% chance of flipping about 1181 heads.\n\nClearly, I am greatly misunderstanding something very simple, but I just can't seem to wrap my head around it on a Friday afternoon.

But the question I have then is what is the alternative way to reduce the number of predictors in a model, so that I'm not fitting meaningless variables?",

The second link does not seem to have properly specified some equations but I think I have reached some posterior marginal distributions for the \"a\" and \"b\" (shape and rate) parameters.\n\nI can use a Monte Carlo method to obtain a simulated (a,b){1:N} sample of the parameters, and also from those pairs further simulate (x){1:N}, where \"x\" form a posterior predictive distribution.\n\nHere's my problem: I can calculate, say, the 95% quantile from (x){1:N) easily enough, and I (think I) can also obtain a distribution of the 95% quantile using each simulated pair (a,b) and then plugging 0.95 into the inverse cumulative function for the corresponding gamma distribution.  I then obtain a singular 95%ile value, from the posterior predictive distribution, and what seems to me to be the posterior distribution for the 95%ile itself.\n\nHowever, the singular value from the PPD is very noticeably biased high (or the posterior distribution of the 95%ile is itself \"low\").  I cannot figure out why.  It's not an issue of too few MC samples.  The bias grows with quantile size (it's greater for the 99%ile, etc.).\n\nThe bias starts to disappear with larger data sample sizes (and is exacerbated with low sample size), which indicates to me that somehow the prior is causing this difference.  However, why this would be is not clear to me.  Since the singular value and the simulated 95%ile values are derived from the same information, prior and posterior, I'd not expect there to be such a large difference.\n\nAny pointers on where things are going wrong?

However, since you are limited by measuring tools, you take multiple measure for each pressure condition you have created and obtain a relational dataset for each variable.\n\nHo: Pressure cannot destroy matter\nHa: Pressure can destroy matter. \n\nSo, to my original questions...\n\nHow should this data look? Should n be normally distributed? Should we consider the distribution of the variables that compose `n`? How would we test this data for a statistical difference between pressure groups?\n\nI understand that this is a silly example but these are the sorts of questions that I have trouble with when looking at data that has been calculated from multiple variables. Thank you for your input.\n",

        "text": "I'm planning to carry out some experiments and I have a few restrictions I need to live with. I would like to know if I'm on the right track here or if there's a better way to design these experiments.\n\n\n**Basics**\n\nFirst of all, the main variable of interest is concentration of substance A and different concentrations of are expected to produce a different result in the end. Because of hardware limitations, I can only run 6 experiments at one time. The concentration range of interest goes from 0 to 100 mg/l and going higher than that is not useful. Chemical A is a really nice since it's always the same and it requires no special procedures. I could buy some A 10 years from now and it would be essentially the same as the one I have today.\n\n\n**Variables that are hard to control**\n\nHowever, the experiment also requires chemicals L and K, but they are the a bit tricky. Both chemicals are complicated mixtures and their exact characteristics depend on a myriad of variables. Sadly, they can not be preserved either, so stockpiling them isn't an option. I just need to collect a sample of L and K from our production and deal with the variations in them. Fortunately though, they are abundant and easily available to me.\n\n\n**Carrying out the experiment**\n\nEvery flask will always have the same concentration of L and K and an interesting concentration of A. Could be like 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/l. The flasks will be mixed on my 6 flask mixer for a few days and the results will be measured. Let's call that response variable I, if someone needs to know. Running those experiments will take a couple of days, so by the time I'm ready for more, the chemicals L and K have already changed so much that I need to harvest a fresh batch. So every time I start another batch of 6 experiments, I'll have the same A as last time but slightly different L and K.\n\n\n**Here are the options I have considered so far**\n\n**Scheme 1.** Three concentrations of A + replicates = 6 flasks. The trouble is, my three concentrations of A might not be that great, so later I'll have to run another experiment like this, but with different concentrations. I might have chosen concentrations 0, 50 and 100 mg/l, but perhaps something important happens at 60 mg/l and I have no data about it. If I run another batch of, let's say 0, 40 and 60 mg/l, I will, of course, have a new batch of L and K, which will affect the results. So, comparing the first and second runs could get messy.\n\n**Scheme 2.** Six concentrations of A + no replicates, using chemicals L1 and K1. Later I'll replicate the same experiment with L2 and K2. Perhaps I'll also run a third batch with L3 and K3.\n\nIs one scheme better than the other? Are there other ways of running such experiments?\n\nThanks.",
