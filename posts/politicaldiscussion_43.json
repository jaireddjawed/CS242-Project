The EU in particular has had to lean on member states to try and raise their taxes, which is against those states (Ireland being a big one) interest as they want to keep the tax revenue and fear tax increases could jeopardize that. \n\nThere are a number of solutions that have been tried, or proposed, but how do you think federal, and supernational governments should try and solve this issue? Or should it even be solved, or should lower taxes be a viable way of maintaining state policy even if it can and does promote a race to the bottom?",

Would it just be similar to the UN declaration of human rights or would you imagine it differently? What specific nuance would you add? Or ambiguity?\n\nAddendum: How might you differentiate between the what should be rights for all people and what should only be rights for citizens?\n\nI'm mostly using the American Bill of Rights as an example to begin discussion on what should be the rights of people. However, it seems there is some confusion in my question. The bill of rights is actually only the first tend amendments to the constitution, as they were added after the constitution was ratified. I'm not asking about what amendments should be added to the constitution around the workings of government like term limits or the judiciary, but rather how the US constitution, or any constitution for that matter, should protect individual rights. If this is still unclear let me know. \n\nwhen I say: bill of rights, i don't mean any amendment to the constitution. Which inalienable individual rights should be codified and protected?",

The most common example that I've heard was that under this directive, it would be illegal to \"rick roll\" somebody because you are sharing copyrighted material.  If you wanted to host/share a meme of Sponge Bob, you would need to pay a license to the copyright holder.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions for discussion:**\n\n* Do you agree with the law?  Should copyright holders be afforded the power and protections outlined by it?\n* How enforceable is this law?\n* How will this affect the internet as a whole, even in non EU countries?\n* What kind of precedent does this set?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
