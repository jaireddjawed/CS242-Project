        "text": "I was hiking the trails of the Kyawonga Nature Reserve, like I do every Saturday morning in the summertime. I got up before dawn, packed my gear, chugged a protein shake, and made the hour and half drive to the Park to avoid the crowds. Let me tell you, it’s all worth it to see that gorgeous golden sunrise over the awe-inspiring Atlantic. There’s a certain feeling you get when you bathe in the glory of nature that just makes you feel … small, like the world is full of beauty and mystery that we as humans just barely manage to comprehend. I hiked to the clearing at Tillman’s Point, just before the restricted area of the Park. It’s the best spot to get my weekly dose of sunrise. I heard the tantric waves lapping on the rocky shores and the cool breeze rustling in the colossal pines. I hopped the barricade and took a seat on overhanging rocks and caught the first glimpse of the rising sun as it painted the horizon in a brilliant medley of orange and pink. I felt truly at peace. \n\nThat feeling came to an abrupt end when I saw her floating alone out there in the water. A girl, maybe eight or nine years old, was bobbing wrong-side-up several meters out in the ocean. I couldn’t believe it at first. No one, especially not kids, were at the park that early. I looked around, there were no parents, no other people, just me. I had to do something. \n\nI carefully climbed down the rocks and out towards the shore. The tide was low, exposing several meters of the sea floor, slippery with reddish mud and sea-grass, on which I stood to get a closer look at the thing in the water. My eyes were not playing tricks on me, there definitely was a girl out there. I took off my backpack and hiking shoes and waded into the chilly water. The further I walked, the deeper the water became and soon I couldn’t touch the bottom. I began swimming out towards the girl. Luckily the sea was calm, it only took me a few minutes to reach her but I wasn’t sure if I had been too late to save her.  \n\nHer hair was long and matted, covering most of her face and neck. Her skin was sickly pale. Her lips were bloodless blue. Her entire body was tangled in a mass of seaweed. I put my arm underneath her and propped her up on my shoulder, she was much lighter than expected. I paddled hard towards the shore and dragged her up onto the dry land. \n\nI was a camp counselor back in my day. I used to teach watercraft safety lessons here at the Kyawonga Summer Camp. The pay wasn’t great, but what I learned from *Camp Kya* definitely came in handy that day. I checked the girl’s pulse, it was weak. I laid her flat on her back, tilted her chin up and pinched her nose. Her skin was ice cold. I took two deep breaths into her mouth and saw that her chest did not rise. I started chest compressions. She seemed so frail, I was scared I might break her ribs. After a few rounds of breaths and compressions, she started to cough. Out came two lung-fulls of sea water of which she spat up directly into my face. CPR is not as glamorous as they make it seem on TV, but it worked, the girl was alive. \n\nShe was scared, as expected. She lurched back as she saw me leaning over her, she didn’t seem to know where she was or how she had gotten there. Panicked, she stumbled on the wet rocks when I reached out a hand. She recoiled and glared ferociously at me like stray cat. Hunched over in a defensive position, I could tell she wanted to sprint away from me but she was too weak, her legs were shaky and she could hardly stand.\n\n“Woah, woah, easy there,” I said as I reach out to her again. She swiped at my hand. “Hey, kid! I just saved your life. The least you could do is say ‘thank you.’” That’s when I noticed her arms, they were covered in tattoos. They looked like runes or hieroglyphs or *something*. They were crudely drawn in black ink and the skin around them was red and irritated. She noticed me looking at them and tried to hide them with her hands. \n\n“Are you ok? I’m just trying to help you.” I stepped back to give her space but she still remained silent and reticent. I saw the fear and mistrust in her eyes. I tried to get her to talk to me, but she just knelt there, staring daggers at me. I thought maybe she didn’t hear me or maybe she didn’t even speak English.\n\n“What is your name?” I asked very slowly, pointing at her. “My name is Gerrard,” I pointed at my chest. “Do you understand me?” She nodded her head. “You almost drowned, but I saved you. What are you doing out here all alone?” She darted her head back and forth frantically as if she was looking for something, or as if something was looking for her. She turned around and stared at the cliff-face. Her gaze lingered in the direction of the sea caves past the barricades, she must have been scared of something over in that direction. “Did you go into the sea caves? You know you’re not supposed to go there, they are very dangerous.” \n\nThe sea caves at Tillman’s Point have been off-limits to the general public since the Fifties. I learned all about it at summer camp. Tourists used to visit the sea caves all the time until one year a mother and her young kids died in there. They lost track of time and the tide came back in and sadly, they all drowned. Their bodies were never found and some people say they can still hear or even see them wandering in the caves at night. It’s just a local ghost story that the councilors tell the campers to scare them from going in there. The county police barricaded the whole area but there’s always that one *cool* kid every year that is stupid enough to go into the caves alone and never come out –alive anyway.\n\n“Where are your parents?” I asked. She turned to look at me then struggled to her feet. I caught her by the elbow and helped her stand. She reeked of seaweed and salt water. I saw that she wasn’t just tangled in the seaweed but she was wearing it. She had fashioned herself a makeshift poncho out of aquatic plants and wore no other clothing. The more I noticed about her the more I got the feeling that she had been out in wilderness for quite a while. She was malnourish and unkempt –almost feral. \n\nShe opened her mouth to speak but no words came out. She seemed as if she wanted to tell me something but she couldn’t for some reason, like she had forgotten how to speak. I walked with her a few meters and sat her down on a large muddy rock. I told her that I was going to get help. I left her on the rock to retrieve my cellphone from my backpack. In the earlier commotion, I had unwittingly placed my backpack too close to the shore, everything inside was soaked, including my phone which wouldn’t turn on. I went back to the girl and gave her my extra sweater to wear, a sip of water from my bottle, and a protein bar to eat; they were all bit soggy but she seemed pleased none the less. She even cracked a frail smile.\n\nI told her that she was too weak to climb the rocks and that I can’t risk carrying her so she would have to stay right there while I climbed up to get help. She nodded along in agreement until she realized that I would be leaving her alone. She looked terrified again. She grabbed my arms and shook her head in disapproval. She did not want me to leave her alone. Again, she tried to speak but she couldn’t make any sound. \n\nShe looked at the rocks underneath her and started to drag her index finger in the mud; she was writing something. *E – M – M – A*, she spelled out in the mud and then pointed at her chest like I had done earlier. “Emma, is that your name?” She nodded: yes. This girl was smarter than I thought. I wasn’t sure if she was just a mute or if she had caught laryngitis from being in the cold water for so long. \n\n“How long have you been out here?” I asked. She looked and me and shrugged her shoulders. She then drew a “?” in the mud. \n\n“You don’t know?” She shook her head again, this time she started to cry. I tried to comfort her and wipe her tears. I carefully moved her wet hair from in front of her eyes revealing another crude tattoo in the center of her forehead. \n\n“ϒ”, like a fancy letter “y”, raw and infected, was engraved into her forehead. It looked like it was carved with a dull knife and dyed black with dark grey ashes. I felt terrible for her. She must have been a victim of a domestic abuse –or the pranksters at the summer camp are getting way out of hand. “Who did this to you?” I gestured to the markings on her body. She began to write in the mud again. \n\n*W – I – T – C – H* \n\n“What? I – I don’t understand.” I tried to ask her another question but she was suddenly distracted. Her attention curiously drawn back towards the sea caves. She sat there, engrossed, as if she had sensed something’s presence nearby. \n\nJust then I realized the weather had taken a turn for the worse. The sky had darkened and the wind had picked up. The waves began crashing violently against the shore. That beautiful sunrise was gone and replaced with dismal grey clouds. It was the strangest thing. I’ve never seen the weather change so quickly. That storm was not in the day’s forecast when I checked it the night prior. Before I knew it, the sea was lapping at my ankles. The tide had risen much sooner than expected.\n\n*WHHHEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*\n\nI heard a terrible, high-pitched howl emanating from the direction of the sea caves. Emma jumped at the sound. She clambered over the rocks and tried to hide herself behind them. She pleaded with me in silence, yanking on my arm, trying to get me to take cover. She was terrified, clearly she was suffering from some post-traumatic stress. She must have associated the sound with the horrifying experience she had that morning.\n\n“It’s ok, it’s ok,” I said, “That’s just the sound that the wind makes when it blows through the caves, it can’t hurt you.” She closed her eyes tight and covered her ears. The sea caves exhaled the sound again. It was louder and higher than before, more of whine than a howl, and it was … *closer!*\n\n*AHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeee*\n\n*Okay, that’s weird*, I thought.  I looked around but I could not see anything nearby that could possibly make a noise like that. *A dying animal, maybe?* Regardless of what made the noise, we had to get out of there quickly, the sea was rising all around us and soon we would be standing in knee-deep water. I grabbed Emma by her arms and pulled her up straight. She fought against me, she wanted to stay hidden. “We have to leave now or else we will both drown. I will carry you, okay?” She nodded and hopped onto my back, her arms wrapped around my neck and her legs across my abdomen.\n\nI scanned the cliff-face to find the easiest ascent up the rocks. I carried her a couple hundred meters or so, across the shoreline to where I found a path that the rocks didn’t look too steep and visualized the steps I would take up the cliff. By then the water was at my ankles, the ocean had swelled; surrounding us. We were trapped in a natural alcove, with the raging water behind me and a wall of solid stone to the right, left and front of me. I knew I had only one way to go: up. \n\nI started the ascent. Emma held on with all her strength, her face pressed firmly into my shoulder, shielding her eyes from the danger all around. With every step my legs would tremble, the extra weight on my back was difficult to keep balanced. I stuck my hands into fissures in the rock and held firmly. The sharp edges sliced into my fingers as I pulled with all my might to lift my body upwards. I placed my feet in the same cracks and slowly but surely, Emma and I were climbing to safety. Every movement I made was deliberate and calculated, fighting against the whipping wind and ocean’s spray; there was no room for error. Despite my strenuous efforts, the tide was still gaining on us. I needed to move faster to get to the top of the cliff before my strength failed me or before I was knocked off the rock wall into the furious sea below. \n\nWe must have been twenty feet above the sea floor, with only a few more feet to the summit, when we heard that horrendous shriek again. \n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n\nIt was right beneath us, ear-piercingly loud, like a police whistle set in front of a foghorn. I winced in pain, I could not cover my ears lest I risk falling to my death. Emma panicked! Like a spooked horse she lost her composure at the sound. She released her grip to cover her ears. Rearing backwards she set me off balance and slipped from my shoulders. \n\nShe managed to grab hold of my pant leg before she fell too far and was dangling helplessly from the cliff. I had to thank the adrenaline in my veins and the durability of my belt, for without them I would not have been able to haul that little girl up with one arm until she had gotten a firm grip on the overhanging roots of a nearby pine tree. I got a hold of the bottom of her foot and hoisted her up to the summit. With one last feat of strength, I dragged myself up using the tree roots like a rope ladder, sending a small avalanche of dirt and pebbles cascading into the blue-grey tumult below. \n\nI collapsed from exhaustion on the dry, flat earth atop the cliff. My face in the dirt, I chuckled with relief at the peril I had just barely survived. I laid there a moment, catching my breath then turned to peer over the precipice of the cliff. I wanted to locate the source of that sound but over the edge I saw nothing but rocks and waves. I could’ve sworn there was something down there.\n\nIt was very strange, as quickly as that storm arrived it vanished just as fast. The clouds parted and the sun poked through. The wind was calm and even the waves slowed their barrage against the rocks. \n\nI turned my attention from the cliff to check on the safety of my new friend. Emma was gone. I searched everywhere for her. I scanned the tree line and looked for footprints in the dirt but I couldn’t find her, she disappeared without a trace. I walked along the hiking trail, calling her name but still –nothing. \n\nI hiked all the way to the park ranger’s station. I told them about the girl; how I found her; about the marks on her arms and face. I even told them about the freak weather change and the strange sounds I heard. They told me that kids have been going missing in the park for years. Many of them are found months after they disappeared, dead and bloated on the shores near Tillman’s point. They said that the legend of the Backwater Banshee had kids daring each other to explore the caves and get a glimpse of the ghost of the woman that died seventy years ago.  The rangers obviously didn’t believe in this legend and assured me that everything I had experienced had a logical explanation. \n\nHowever, the rangers told me that there may have been an open missing person’s case regarding a girl named Emma that was filed a few years back. They took my information and they said they would call me if they had any more questions. In the meantime, they would send out patrols in search of the girl and that I was free to go home. \n\nI couldn’t stop thinking about her the whole drive home. *Why did she run away from me? How could she just disappear? What was she so afraid of in those caves?* \n\nThat evening I told my wife about what happened to me at the park. I left out some of the more sensitive details, I didn’t want her to worry. I was drained after my experience that day and headed off to bed early. I needed my rest and I tried very hard not to stay up over-thinking about the girl –or about that that dreadful sound. That is, until I heard it again that night.\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nI jumped out of bed, nearly touching the ceiling. That sound – that *scream*, was coming from right outside my house. It had followed me home –*whatever it was*. I ran to the window to investigate. From it, I could see the lonely street lamp on my sleepy suburban road nestled in shrubbery and partially covered by a large elm tree. The lamp illuminated a dark and solitary figure; hunched and motionless, with disheveled hair and clothing, lanky arms and spindly legs. It appeared to be an elderly woman, though it didn’t move like one, for when it saw me in the window it dashed with inhuman speed behind the elm and out of sight.\n\n“WHO ARE YOU?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?” I yelled angrily out the window at the figure. There was no reply. I saw no one out the window after that, nor anyone when I went downstairs to check it out from the front door. My wife urged me to return to bed and insisted that I was just hallucinating from the stressful day I had. I stayed up a bit longer before my weariness took me, the image of that old hag burned into my mind; the sound of that scream still rang in my ears. \n\nThe next morning, I went to check my yard for signs of the thing I had seen the previous night. To my utter shock, I found a scrap of seaweed underneath the lamppost where it had stood. *I was not hallucinating*. I don’t know what that thing was or what it wanted but I did know that it had something to do with the girl in the water, for when I turned and faced my house from the street I could see its foul artwork. \n\n“ϒ” was painted, large and bold, in red blood on my front door.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNovember 26th, 2022\n\n*Something is wrong with my husband.* It’s in the way he talks to me, as though we were strangers with nothing in common. It’s in his glassy-eyed stare, as though his mind is someplace far away. Someplace I can't follow. \n\n*Talk to him,* my psychiatrist tells me. As if I hadn’t tried that already. The excuses are always the same. When Brendan gets that dreamy expression on his face, it’s because he’s *“tired,”* but when I catch him creeping around the house in the middle of the night, it’s because he *“can’t sleep.”* We used to share *EVERYTHING* with each other. Now, though, I’m lucky if I can get more than a sentence out of him. The more confrontational I get, the more he laughs, smiles, shrugs it off. *But I’m not the irrational one here. He’s hiding something–*I just can’t figure out what! It’s maddening. \n\nI'm sick of waking up and finding a cold, hollow space beside me. I'm sick of seeing that eerie  glow beneath his home office door every night, after he *thinks* that I'm asleep.\n\nI'm through with his excuses. I've got to write this down, otherwise I won't have the courage do it: *tonight, I'm going to confront him. I'm going to push open that door without knocking…and find out once and for all what's on the other side.*\n\nNovember 29th, 2022\n\n*I made my husband angry last night.* And at this point, I'm going to consider that progress. He finally showed real emotion, even if that emotion made me cover my face like I was expecting him to attack me. Or maybe I just didn't want to look at the crazy way his face rearranged itself like barely-melted wax: going from animal rage to that creepy smile of his in five seconds flat.  I'd half-expected to catch him with his pants down (literally) but he'd just been standing there, all scratched up and…*covered with dirt.* When I confronted him, he made the usual excuses–*nothing really, I was just coming back to bed–*and I lost it. I told him he'd been acting like a freak for weeks now, and demanded that he tell me what was going on.\n\nAnd then, for the first time since I married Brendan, I felt real fear. \n\nFear *for* him? Fear *of* him? I'm not sure. \n\nHe looked through me, like I was a child asking questions about the heat death of the universe. Like I was sticking my nose into something that I couldn't possibly comprehend.\n\nHe shouldered past me and went back to bed without a word. \n\nMy psychiatrist also told me that I should reread what I write. When I do, though…I don't like how I sound. *I come across as the bad guy here!* Maybe Brendan is just planning some surprise romantic getaway or buying my Christmas gifts early–\n\nBut I doubt it.\n\nDecember 3rd, 2022\n\n*Is something wrong with my husband, or is something wrong with me?* I’m becoming obsessed with Brendan’s obsession. It’s affecting my sleep, my work, even my relationships with other people. My mother called yesterday–panicking because I hadn’t answered her messages in over a week–but the truth is, I hadn’t even noticed. My thoughts drift back to it constantly: *what could Brendan be hiding?* \n\nI told myself I'd never turn into one of *those* wives: the kind who snoops through their husband's phone or fishes his bank statements out of the paper shredder, searching for proof of infidelity. But that’s exactly what I did this afternoon…and I didn't like what I found.\n\nBrendan had spent over half his salary last month on a jumble of letters and numbers–or at least, that was how the purchases showed up: *disguised.* Just looking at them gave me a chill: I didn’t know Brendan was *capable* of being so careful, so *methodical.* This was a man who can’t find two socks in the morning, and there he was creating a coverup for…*what?* \n\nI figured I’d find the answer on his phone, but getting it away from him was easier said than done. The way he stares at it reminds me of the way I saw him staring at his blank computer screen that night…and as soon as I get close, he angles it away from me.\n\nThen he gets that look on his face. *The monster look,* I’ve started calling it.\n\nThat expression that goes from rage, to confusion, to a chilling Ted Bundy smile. \n\n*God, I can already imagine how it’ll go.* \n\nI’ll be laying by Brendan’s side at night, my brain burning through all the possibilities of what he *might* be up to. He’ll lurch out of bed once he thinks I’m asleep, only this time, he won’t slink off to do…*whatever it is he does in his office at night.* Instead, he’ll wrap his hands around my neck. Those hands will feel cold and strong and totally unlike my husband’s, but when he starts to squeeze my eyes will pop open…and I’ll be looking up at Brendan’s grinning face. \n\nDecember 10th, 2022\n\n*I’m in uncharted territory now.* I’ve officially gone from behavior that’s slightly nosy to downright stalkerish. I took a few days off of work. I told my boss I had a *‘family emergency’*...but I didn’t say anything to Brendan. I just followed him around for three entire days in a rented car like a cheap detective. As far as I can tell, being a Private Eye mostly involves overeating, fighting boredom, and peeing behind bushes in parking lots. \n\nIn another life, maybe I would’ve been good at it: I didn’t lose sight of Brendan even once.\n\nThen again, he didn’t do anything strange either. Straight to work and back home again. On Tuesday he went grocery shopping, Wednesday he had his home improvement course at the library, Friday he had his weekly meetup at a sports bar with friends from work. \n\nNo mistresses. No blackmail. No bodies in the woods. \n\nJust a sleep-deprived wife in a rented Audi staring through the windshield and questioning her sanity. \n\nDecember 13th, 2022\n\n*It seems like my luck has finally turned around.* I got access to Brendan’s phone yesterday. It slipped out of his pants while he was driving. Like a pickpocket, I leaned over to take a sip of my coffee and brought his phone back with me when I set my cup back down. I used my back to keep it pressed against the passenger’s seat until a chance came to hide it in my purse. *Mission accomplished.* We were going Christmas shopping, and I took advantage of that fact to get away from Brendan and pay a visit to a little cell phone store in the mall, where Bei works. \n\nI met Bei in college years ago, and we stayed in touch. The guy never said much about his background, but one thing quickly became clear to our whole class: the guy could find, fix, or hotwire *anything.* \n\nWant textbook PDFs? Bei had the downloads.\n\nLaptop not working? Bei knew what the problem was. \n\nNeed a second chance on an online quiz? Bei could hack it. \n\nI could only hope that he’d remember me and have the skills to uncover the tracks my husband was trying so hard to hide. Bei not only recognized me, he also shouted my name so loudly half the mall could hear it. By the time I entered the shop he was already smiling and pulling up pictures from our college days, asking how I’d been–but something in my eyes stopped him mid-sentence. \n\n*Do I really seem that crazy?* \n\nBei motioned me into his *‘office’–*basically a closet with lots of wires–and asked me what was wrong. Without going into too much detail, I explained that I was worried about my husband and needed access to his phone. \n\nJust like that, the old Bei was back. No more questions about kids or puppies: right down to business. I don’t know how he did it, but less than twenty minutes later he was handing my husband’s whole history on a separate memory card. He told me it was on the house, a gift for an old client*.* As I was walking out the door, though, he grabbed my arm. *Call me.* Bei said. *You really look like shit.* \n\nDecember 14th, 2022\n\n*“Always nice to see old friends, isn’t it?”* My husband had said, when we got back in the car that day at the mall. Coming from him, it sounded like a threat. *He must’ve heard Bei call out my name, seen us go into the back room together…did he also know that I’d taken his phone?* I hoped not; I’d slipped it into the space between the driver’s seat and the seatbelt when we got back into the car, making it seem like it’d been there all along, but I have no way of knowing if I’d aroused his suspicions. Today, I’m home alone at last, and I’ve been going through the data the Bei copied for me. What I’ve found is…weird to say the least. Part of me wants to believe that this is all a sick joke, that the curtains will come up and Brendan and Bei and everyone else will point at me and laugh, then life will go back to normal…\n\nThe first strange thing I found was in the group chat my husband has with the guys at his work. \n\nIt started with a link sent by a guy named Mark: a young guy with short brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses, if I remember him right from the last company dinner.\n\nI didn’t click on the link, especially after seeing the barrage of messages that came after:\n\n*“Whoa, not funny dude, I almost opened that at my desk,”* replied Alan.\n\n*“Daaamn, she fine as hell!”* according to Eli.\n\n*“How’d you find this?!”* asked Javier. \n\n*“Come on now, I’m a married man*,” my husband Brendan wrote in.\n\nMark's response to them was unnerving to say the least: “*uh, guys…I didn’t send that link.”*\n\n*“Yeah, whatever,”* Eli wrote back. *“Nice find!”*\n\n*“Anyone else dream about HER last night?”* Javier had typed at 5:30 the next morning.\n\n*“Gross”* was my husband’s reply. Both Eli and Mark had responded with a *‘Thumbs Up’* to the original message. \n\nThe weird fixation on the girl from the link only got worse as the day went on. Gone were their bored workplace discussions about whether the Death Star had insurance or who was going to win the next UFC fight.\n\nIt was suddenly all about…*HER.* Message after message of\n\n*“Her eyes, man. They’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen…”* \n\n*“Did you see the way she…?”*\n\n*“Has anyone heard her talk yet?”*\n\n*“I hope she’s online again tonight!”* \n\nTwo things unnerved me about my husband’s (suddenly very active) work group chat. The first was the way my husband had to keep asking them to stop discussing *‘HER’* and get back on task; it wasn’t at all like my Brendan to be the responsible one in the room, so how bad must the others have been? According to the last messages of the day, bad enough that Brendan was afraid for their jobs. The second cue was less obvious, but no more unsettling.\n\nAt much as my husband’s workmates were raving about this girl, they couldn’t seem to agree on what she looked like…and as I scrolled on, the weirdness only intensified:\n\n*“Ugh. I was up all night…”* Mark wrote. \n\n*“I think we all were!”* Three thumbs up. *“But she put on a helluva show, am I right?”*\n\n*“I’m starting to get seriously concerned for you guys’ health LOL”* replied my husband. That “*LOL”* was troubling. My husband never used it unless he meant the opposite of *‘laughing out loud.’* Brendan’s crew had him worried–and for good reason.\n\nBy the end of their shift, they were arguing about who this girl belonged to.\n\n*“DON’T TRY ME!”* Eli sounded enraged. *“SHE’S FUCKING MINE!!!”* \n\nAfter that, he left the chat. \n\n*“So that was weird…”* my husband wrote to the remaining members.\n\n*“No kidding. Especially since me and her are meant to be together forever…”* Javier replied.\n\n*“THIS ISN’T FUNNY!”* Brendan was furious as well. *“We might have just lost a friend…AND BECAUSE OF WHAT?! Some stupid webcam show?!”*\n\n*“Call her stupid again and see what happens.”* Javier wrote.\n\n*“Parking lot after work, pussy.”* Mark added. *“If you’re man enough. I’ll send her your head on a fucking plate.”* \n\nEven though I was just reading Brendan’s messages, I tensed up imagining him sitting there at his desk, one of his best friends missing and the other two staring daggers at him. Wondering whether or not these two guys who he would’ve trusted with his life were actually going to attack him. I checked the date on the chat: *November 18th.* Back before all this started, but…hadn’t Brendan come home with a bunch of cuts and bruises around that time? I couldn’t remember the exact date…but he’d said that he had *‘fallen down in the parking lot…’*\n\n*“I’ll send you her head on a fucking plate,”* Mark had written. \n\nIt was the end of their group chat–\n\nBut Javier had sent my husband another set of rapid-fire messages later that night. It’s worth noting that Javier is (or *was*) a recovering alcoholic, with three completed years in AA. While sipping sprite at an office Christmas party, he’d told my husband and I that one of the only things he remembered from his *‘blotto years’* was the way he’d give people stupid nicknames. \n\n*“I’m warning you Brenny-boy,”* Javier wrote to my husband on the night of November 22nd, *“don’t click that link. It’ll ruin your life. It sure as fuck ruined mine. I can’t think about anything but HER anymore. Not unless I drink.”* \n\n*“Where are you?”* Brendan texted him back, even though it was after midnight. *“Stop what you’re doing and let's talk, okay? Are you about to take a drink?”* \n\n*“About to?”* Javier responded. *“I’m six beers in! It’s funny. If I wasn't, I don't think I could even talk to you about this…she’s in my head, Brenny-boy. Like one of those bugs that eats its host from the inside out…”*\n\n*“Where are you?”* my husband insisted–\n\nBut Javier never replied. \n\nThere was, however, an audio that my husband sent to Mark the next day:\n\n*“Look man, I know we’ve had our differences lately, but we need to talk about Javier. I haven’t heard from him since last night, he’s not at work, and I think he’s hitting the bottle again. Come on, man. We’ve been pals since ‘06! Why won’t you talk to me?”* \n\nThat was as far as I got today. It was pure luck that I heard the sound of my husband’s key turning in the front door lock over the sound of his own voice in the stolen recording. I paused it fast enough that he didn’t hear it…I think. \n\nDecember 15th, 2022\n\n*It was hard to act normal last night, considering what I’d just learned about my husband, his friend, and that weird link.* It tempted me all night. I wanted to click on it myself…\n\nBut I held back. I had to go back to work, but I spent my lunch break with my husband’s duplicated SIM card, revisiting old conversations, including one I should have noticed right away–because it was a conversation with Bei. \n\nBrendan introduced himself as my husband, and said I’d given him the number (a total lie). He told Bei that he’d heard stories about what a master hacker he was (which might’ve been true; I tended to tell college stories when I’d had a few too many). \n\n*He wanted to know if Bei could find the owner of a website, without opening the link itself.*\n\n*He wanted Bei to doxx someone. Money, he said, was no object.*\n\nA bank transfer was made. A day later, my old pal provided my husband with a girl’s name and address. *Just like back in college–no questions asked.* \n\n*Guilt,* I suddenly understood why Bei had called me over so eagerly, why he’d been so strangely ready to help. When he’d given my husband that girl’s information and never heard back, he must’ve realized that he’d made a terrible mistake. *He’d been trying to make it right.*\n\n*But did Brendan know he’d helped me?* \n\nThere were no more texts, but there *was* an email from a throwaway account: \n\n*\"Brendan, it's Eli.* \n\n*I need your help, brother. You were right.*\n\n*It was like my brain was in a fog. All it took was one look at her website, and I was giving up my money, my passwords, anything she asked for.*\n\n*I never would've snapped out of it…except now Mark's gone too. You know how I always pick him up on the way to work? Today his house was unlocked and empty. He's gone to HER, I know it. Brendan…if I tell you what I really think you'll call me crazy, but she wants to drain more than just our bank accounts. Javier's disappeared, Mark too, and who knows how many others she's…drained. We have to find a way to stop her…a way to stop her without looking at her.* \n\n*If you see her, brother…even for a second…she gets inside your head. I'll be at the bar this afternoon. Please, let's meet. We've got to stop this.\"*\n\nMy husband's response to Eli's email was just as chilling–because it was a shopping list. A shopping list for things like hand-held mirrors, black canvas bags, silver chains, a shovel…and a wooden stake.\n\nI shuddered. That must've been the day I'd followed him. I'd thought he was meeting his three best friends for drinks…but in reality he was only meeting one. To plan an insane kidnapping. I had no way of knowing what else  they’d discussed, but whatever it was, I had a feeling that it didn’t bode well for *“Lily Prota, 11 Herringwood Ave, \\[City and State Redacted\\].”* Still, when I reverse-searched the name and address Bei had sent, I found something strange: there didn’t seem to be any evidence that a physical person with that name had ever existe–\n\nDecember 16th, 2022\n\n*I’m still reeling from everything that’s happened in the last few days.* It started when Brendan caught me. He must’ve suspected something, creeping around through the back door the way he did, and I was so engrossed in what I was doing that I didn't see his shadow falling over me until it was too late. My husband had never been the type to fly off the handle or lose his cool when he got angry; it was one of the things I loved about him. But when I felt his hands grab my shoulders and slam me against the wall, I knew that man was gone forever. His face, just inches from mine, was like a plastic mask. *\"You have no idea,\"* he whispered, *\"no idea at all.\"* His eyes blurry with rage and fear. This was a man whose sanity was on it's final threads–and unraveling fast.\n\n\"You have to let me go.\" I forced my voice to remain calm. \"I have to go back to work. I'm on my lunch break. They're waiting for me.\"\n\nSomehow, those magically familiar words–*work, lunch break*–made Brendan loosen his vice grip on my shoulders. It was enough. I slipped past him, crying, but I didn't run to my car. \n\nI went to Brendan's office instead. \n\nLocking the door behind me, I tapped the floor with my foot in search of what I knew I'd find: a trapdoor, hidden beneath the carpet. *How had I not noticed it before?* The way he'd come in here but make no sound, seeming to disappear…\n\n*He hadn't been in this room; he'd been* below *it.*\n\nI barely registered Brendan's panicked pounding on the door, the way he kept yelling: *\"Stop! You don't know what you're doing! For the love of God, STOP!\"*  \n\nFull of foreboding, I peeled back the carpet. A square of flooring had been cut out, and beneath it, a hastily-dug grave. *Lily Prota's.*\n\nThe lid of the cheap coffin in front of me was barely covered by a thin layer of dirt. I brushed it off and tore it open, hoping against hope that they hadn't killed her yet.\n\nThe girl inside the coffin was beautiful beyond words…but she wasn't breathing. Eli and my husband had bound her hands and wrists with silver chains, covered her head with a black bag…and hammered a wooden stake into her chest. I brought a hand to my mouth. *They'd murdered this poor girl.*\n\nI couldn't help but jump a little when she spoke, her voice whispy and weak beneath the black cloth. \n\n*\"Please…help me. Take this stake out…and the mask…I can't breathe…\"*\n\n\"We should wait for a doctor.\" I'd already called 9-1-1. \"And my husband–\"\n\n*\"You have to do it!\"* She moaned. *\"I'll die if you don't, I can feel it!\"*\n\n\"STOP!\" Brendan rammed his shoulder into the door until it shook on its hinges. I had to make a decision. I looked at the girl buried in the shallow grave beneath my house. There were goosebumps, cuts, and bruises on her brown skin. She was trembling, crying, and scared. *She needed my help!*\n\nI grabbed the stake and twisted it free. They hadn't managed to hammer through her ribcage, but it must've put pressure on her lungs.\n\nJust before Brendan burst through the door, I tore away her hateful canvas hood and looked into her eyes.\n\nDecember 17th, 2022\n\nWhen the police responded to my 911 call, I told them it was a misdial. They asked if it was alright if they took a look around, and of course I let them in. After all, the square of carpet in the office had been replaced, and Lily was beneath it with Brendan–feeding. She must've been so hungry these past weeks. The moment I saw her face, I knew she wasn't a monster to be imprisoned; *she was a goddess to be worshiped.* That's why I pulled Brendan's legs out from beneath him and helped Lily to drag him into the hole he'd dug…for her. \n\nHe'll *NEVER* have her now. \n\nShe's mine, and I'm hers. \n\nAll I have, all I am–is hers. \n\n*I know we'll be so happy together.*  \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

My name is \\[//EXPUNGED DATA//\\].\n\nRick: Hi.\n\nJohn: Why the long face?\n\nRick is silent for a second before replying.\n\nRick: I have many reasons, all which are valid.\n\nJohn: I believe you are talking about your family?\n\nRick: How many times do I need to fucking tell you, I didn’t do anything!\n\nJohn: I understand what you believe, Rick. But the facts stand: Your family is dead and you are alive. And you have yet to provide any other possible explanation, not even in court.\n\nRick: I can’t tell anyone what happened. What *really* happened. They would move me from this hellhole to somewhere even worse.\n\nJohn: And why do you think that, Rick? What happened?\n\nRick is completely silent.\n\nJohn: Rick?\n\nHe still doesn’t talk.\n\nJohn: Rick, please talk to me.\n\nRick: It was Jesse.\n\nJohn: Who is Jesse? What did Jesse do?\n\nRick: Jesse killed my family.\n\nJohn: Who is Jesse?\n\nRick: (takes a deep breath) I… I met her last month. On vacation, at the beach. I saw her on the pier, sitting by herself on a bench. And she was beautiful. So goddamn *beautiful*. I walked over and sat next to her. We began talking, and she said we should hang out sometime. I agreed, and got her number.\n\nJohn: Rick, I’m sorry to interrupt, but you were a married man a month ago.\n\nRick: So? You didn’t see her. She was the most stunning woman I had ever seen, and that I ever will see. Got any other questions, or can I continue?\n\nJohn: Please.\n\nRick: A week later, after we had gone back to our respective homes, she called me about potentially meeting up soon. I said it would be great, and she said that she would come over to Chicago and meet me.\n\nJohn: Did she?\n\nRick: The next day. We met at a fancy restaurant. \n\nJohn: Did you tell her you were married?\n\nRick: I… I did, at the end of the dinner. But she wasn’t sad. Or mad. There was something else on her face as she left that restaurant. I didn’t know what it was then, but I do now. It was malice. Pure hatred.\n\nJohn is silent.\n\nRick: I never told her where I lived. I never even mentioned a neighborhood. But as I drove, I kept seeing the same car ahead of me. Not behind me. Ahead, turning a corner just as I came to that light.\n\nJohn: Was it her?\n\nThere is no response, but it can be inferred that Rick nods at this point.\n\nRick: Eventually, she got too far ahead. I couldn’t see her anymore. I began to panic. That look on her beautiful face… I wish I would have done something different. Not told her, maybe. Maybe then my family would still be happy. Alive.\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\nJohn: What happened?\n\nRick: You know what happened.\n\nJohn: Can you… tell me in your own words?\n\nRick: When I got home, there was blood *everywhere*. Neighbors had heard screaming and called the police. So there I was, sitting in a house full of dead, mutilated people, *my own family*, for fucking Christ’s sake, and I was arrested. You were there for the rest of it.\n\nJohn: Why didn’t you say any of this?\n\nRick: Well, as soon as I could, I called Jesse. Some random lady picked up. She said that this number is hers and has been for quite a long time.\n\nJohn: Could you have gotten the number wrong?\n\nRick: No. I knew it. I *still* know it.\n\nJohn: If what you are saying is true, there has been a murderer on the loose for over a month, without us even knowing about it.\n\nRick: I swear to you, I’m not lying. I’m not!\n\nJohn: I know… that you *think* you are telling the truth, Rick.\n\nRick: You piece of shit, you don’t believe me!\n\nJohn: That’s not what I’m saying. Please, calm down.\n\nThere is a large crash, before the recording device cuts out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days after the date of this recording, John was reported missing, as well as Rick. Neither of them have been found as of now. They are both presumed dead.\n\nI found this recording in the depths of a government archive, along with many other files, all titled JESSE with a file name. I tried to save as many as I could before I left, but I must have missed quite a few.\n\nI will try to share as many of these files as possible before I am found out.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJulius Klein",

        "text": "“Darren, did you know they opened a Target in Owingsville?” my wife Deborah asked me excitedly. “Grab the car keys and let's go check it out!”\n\nI rolled my eyes. It was almost six in the evening and I had a long day at work. The prospect of an hour's drive there, two hours of shopping, and an hour's drive home wasn’t appealing.\n\n“They didn’t open a damn Target in Owingsville,” I replied curtly. “Only about two thousand people live there. Why in the hell would a multibillion-dollar corporation open a store in the middle of the sticks in a town that isn’t big enough to support a McDonald’s?”\n\nSquealing wood on tile penetrated my ears as she pushed the barstool away from the kitchen counter. Her footfalls approaching my chair were heavy like a pouting child’s. I should have known better than to start an argument with her about Target.\n\nShe dropped something from above me. A glossy red mailer advertisement sailed through the air over the top of my head. I looked down at my lap to see the familiar red and white logo. The cluster of red vested employees smiled up at me from the shiny cardstock.\n\n*Target would like to welcome you to our newest location in Owingsville, KY. Bring this ad to the registered for an additional 10% off of your first purchase!*\n\nShe worshiped the damn place. We lived in Lexington, Kentucky and she made the rounds between all three. *The Clearance Queen*, she called herself. Deb would buy clearance items by the carload from any Target within a reasonable drive and resell them on Amazon.\n\nRetail arbitrage, I think she called it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. She made some decent money with it. We were middle-aged and empty nesters when she started. Her entire life had been devoted to raising the kids. When Dustin and Jessica left for college she struggled a bit. Stirred around the house like a caged animal.\n\nI pushed her to find a hobby. It was a few years until I would retire. Most of her friends worked.\n\nThat’s when the Target clearance sprees started.\n\n“Owingsville is almost an hour away and there are three damn Targets here in town,” I said, irritation building. “Why do we need to drive out to the middle of nowhere to get what we could find in town?”\n\nMy wife went back to the kitchen and started washing the dishes. Every movement she made was exaggerated to show her displeasure. Cabinets closed so hard they were just shy of a slam. Glasses hammered on the counter so hard I expected to hear them shatter. She signed at least three times a minute.\n\nI wish I hadn’t given in. If I would have just stood my ground, maybe everything would have been alright. Our family would still be whole. Police detectives wouldn’t stop by the house every week “just for a chat.”\n\nBut I did give in.\n\nI agreed to go.\n\n“Grab your purse and put on your shoes,” I huffed, pushing myself out of the recliner. “We can go, but no more than an hour of shopping. I’ve got to work in the morning so we can’t fool around all night.”\n\nShe squealed with excitement and ran off to the bedroom.\n\nWhy the hell did I agree to go?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe drive to Owingsville was uneventful. NPR news stories played on the radio as my wife fidgeted with her cell phone. While I had been mildly irritated before we left the house, I was almost to a raging boil by the time we got to Owingsville.\n\nAn hour's drive to the middle of the country and my wife looked at Amazon listings the entire drive.\n\nWe had already reached the center of Owingsville and the GPS said there were still two and a half miles to go. From the overhead view on the map, the address was a good distance outside of town headed toward Morehead. The location of the store was making less sense at the moment.\n\n“Are you sure you put the right address in the GPS?” I asked Deborah.\n\nShe didn’t answer, still scrolling through her phone.\n\n“Deborah,” I said a bit louder. She looked up at me and smiled. The sweetness of it cooled my anger down to a dull simmer. I even felt bad for being angry. Her life had changed so much in the last year and this was something she did to pass some lonely times. “Sweety, are you sure you put in the right address? I really don’t think this can be right.”\n\nDeb leaned over and pulled out the cardstock advertisement from her purse and looked at the address. Reaching over, she pulled the GPS from the dashboard and punched a few buttons. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see a confused expression consume her face.\n\n“Yeah,” she said. “It’s the right address. The weird thing is the GPS just corrected itself. It was down to two miles and jumped back up to two and a half miles. Still says it’s straight ahead on the right though.”\n\nI wasn’t concerned yet, but I was confused. The GPS clearly said two and a half miles when we pulled out of Owingsville onto the dark country lane. We had been on the road for nearly a minute. It could have been a glitch in the software, but it still left me with an uneasy feeling.\n\nMy eyes darted back and forth from the GPS screen and the darting yellow lines in the center of the road. The mileage was decreasing as it should have and I felt relieved. Only a mile ahead, we would be there soon. I looked back at the road and looked for parking lot lights in the distance.\n\n“*You missed your destination. Please make a u-turn when able and head back two and a half miles. Your destination will be on the right side of the road.”*\n\n“What the hell?” I said in a panic. The GPS had just said one mile only moments before. There was no way I had driven a mile and a half past a huge department stool on the side of a dark country highway and missed it. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”\n\nI pulled the car onto the shoulder and made a U-turn. As we drove back in the direction that we came, my fluttered with nervous energy. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.\n\nWas I zoning out while we drove?\n\nWas the GPS malfunctioning?\n\nDid the damn store even exist?\n\nJust a moment before I was going to tell my wife we were heading home, I could see an unnaturally bright light ahead in the woodline. The tops of parking lot lights peaked over the top of the forest. I turned to Deborah to voice my concern, but her face was painted with a satisfied grin.\n\n“I told you we’d find it,” she exclaimed with excitement. We pulled around the treeline to see an immense parking lot in front of the brightly lit store. There were maybe three cars parked at the far side of the lot. The car returns were empty. It looked like no one had been there other than a few employees. “You were all worked up over nothing.”\n\nI pulled the car into a parking space closest to the door. We got out and started walking toward the entrance. There was emotionless elevator music playing in the parking lot. I looked up toward the tops of the light poles but didn’t see any speakers. None of the Targets in Lexington played the canned music, and it filled me with a strange sense of dread. It was as though it came from nowhere.\n\nEven the entrance to the building was strange. While most stores have an entrance directly in the center of the building or two mirrored entrances on each end of the building, there was only one here. It was almost directly at the far right corner of the building. \n\nI looked to my left and saw the three other cars in the lot were parked all the way to the right. Maybe there was an employee door on the side of the building, but I couldn’t see a walkway. There were four or five feet of grass between the parking lot and the edge of the building.\n\nSomething about the exterior was offputting as well.\n\nEvery other store I had seen was a cream or beige color with a few red awnings and a red Target logo next to the store name. Not this one. The entire building was fire engine red. It reminded me of the unrealistically bright blood from the old eighties slasher films.\n\nWhere there would usually be only one Target logo, the building was covered in them. Hundreds maybe. All different sizes. Some of the larger logos had smaller ones between the red and white circles. A few overlapped.\n\nStrangest of all, there was no sign that just said *Target*.\n\n“Deb, something about this is weirding me out,” I said hesitantly. “Let’s come back tomorrow during the day. Looks like they could be closed anyhow. Not many cars in the lot.”\n\nShe stopped and turned toward me. The exuberant grin had vanished from her face and was replaced by a set of furrowed brows. Her body was slightly rigid and her head turned slowly from side to side.\n\n“We drove an hour to get her and you nearly got us lost twice,” she said angrily. “Don’t you think for a second we’re going home. If you’re going to act like an ass the whole time, go wait in the car.”\n\nI was a bit dumbstruck. Deb was usually soft-spoken and sweet. Only a hand full of times had I ever heard her curse. Never at me.\n\nShe turned and went through the sliding doors at the front of the store.\n\nHurt and angry, I went back to the car.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor the first thirty minutes Deb was inside, I scanned the parking lot like a prey animal searching for a hunter. No cars passed on the main road and no one pulled into the parking lot. There was no motion that I could detect through the glass doors into the building. Occasionally a light would flicker in the parking lot. Otherwise, things seemed relatively normal.\n\nI tried to call Deborah once or twice but didn’t get an answer. Halfway through a lengthy, apologetic text message, I decided to leave her alone. She probably needed time to cool off and Target bargain shopping was probably the best medicine for that.\n\nAt some point, I fell asleep. It wasn’t intentional, but there is only so much aimless scrolling on a smartphone I can do before I start to nod in and out. Once I start to drift, an involuntary nap is always in my future.\n\nI had been asleep for around forty-five minutes when my cell phone began to buzz in my hand. Startled by the sudden motion, I looked down at my phone. There was a text message from Deb. I thought it was just Deb telling me she was running behind but checking out.\n\n***Help me.*** \n\nThe messaging was confusing. Did she want help carrying something to the car? Was there something she wanted my opinion on? I sent a reply.\n\n***What do you need help with, sweety?***\n\nNo response. Three minutes passed. I tried again.\n\n***You okay?***\n\nAnother few minutes and still no reply.\n\n***I’m getting worried. Do I need to come in?***\n\nI waited for another minute but she never texted me back. Unsnapping my seatbelt, I pushed the door of the car open and felt resistance and a loud *smack*. Looking to my left, there was a yellow car next to me. It hadn’t been there when I went to sleep and I had just slammed my door into the side of it.\n\nThere was just enough room for me to slide out, so I wedged myself sideways and closed my door. Bending over, I looked at the side of the yellow car where my door had made contact. There was no dent or mark. With relief, I stood and turned to head toward the door.\n\nI was started by an ocean of yellow cars. There were dozens of makes and models, but each vehicle in the lot was yellow. Almost every single parking space was filled.\n\nBut there was no one in the parking lot.\n\nWhen I turned to head toward the door, there was no one moving around inside that I could see from there.\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I passed through the entryway doors, the store looked like it should with a few exceptions. All of the registers were self-checkout with no place for an attendant. Where you would expect to find a customer service department, there was an empty red wall. There was a cart corral but it stood empty. All of the products I could see on the shelf had no writing. Just the Target logo and a picture of what was inside.\n\nStrangest of all was the lack of people.\n\nThe only noise in the building was a keyboard version of *The Girl from Ipanema*. It had a tinny quality to it, as though it were playing from a World War 2 era radio. Crackles of static pierced through occasionally causing me to wince. \n\n“Hello?” I said loudly. It wasn’t quite a shout, but there was more volume to it than my normal speaking voice. It took most of my willpower not to scream at the top of my lungs, but I didn’t want to make myself seem unstable if it turned out there were other people in the store.\n\n*There has to be someone else here,* I thought to myself. *Why the hell would the parking lot be full if no one was inside?*\n\nNo one answered my call.\n\n“Excuse me!” I said a bit louder. My footfalls almost seemed to echo as I walked into the store. “Deborah? Can you hear me?”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Is anyone in this damn building?” I screamed. My temples were throbbing and it felt like the canned music pouring from the speakers grew louder to drown out my calls. I was running down the aisles, looking side to side frantically. Passing row after row of generic shelves filled with red packaging, I screamed my wife’s name over and over. \n\nMy phone vibrated in my pocket and I pulled it out. Another text from Deborah.\n\n***Please get me out of here.***\n\nA chill ran up my spine.\n\n***Can you hear me screaming for you?***\n\nThe ellipsis bubble popped up showing she was typing a response.\n\n***No. I can only hear the red men. I’m hiding from them in the bathroom. Please come help me.***\n\nI didn’t have time to register what she meant by “the red men”. Breaking into a run, I headed toward the back of the store. As I passed by the clothing section I panicked and jumped back, slamming into a rack filled with clothing. \n\nA red faceless man was standing on a platform behind the rows of clothing.\n\nTerrified, I pushed myself backward and hid behind a shelf. There was no sound of movement. Only the tinny music playing from overhead. I couldn’t decide if the red man hadn’t seen me. After a few moments, I slowly peeked my head around the shelf toward the clothing section.\n\nThe man stood stoically behind the rows of clothing. Bright lines of light reflected off of his smooth body. He didn’t move at all.\n\n*It’s a mannequin*, I thought. *Move your ass and find Deborah.*\n\nI stood and walked back around the shelf. Without the lens of fear, I could see that the shiny red man was only a mannequin. There were no clothes on it yet. Maybe the store opened before they were able to finish setting up the store.\n\nAs I walked past it, my pulse slowed. I could see the bathroom sign hanging from the ceiling overhead and moved in that direction. As soon as I got Deborah out of the bathroom, we were going to get out of there and blow every stop light between Owingsville and Lexington.\n\nThen I heard footsteps.\n\nWhen I turned to face the clothing section, I could see the bright red mannequin was off of the pedestal. It stood on the bright white tiles of the walkway. In only a moment, the thing had moved at least fifteen feet in my direction.\n\nThere was no one around.\n\n“What the hell?” I said aloud.\n\nSlowly, I began to walk backward toward the bathroom, keeping my eyes locked on the mannequin. It didn’t move, but I had the uncomfortable feeling that it was watching me with its featureless face. Sweat began to pour from my forehead.\n\nSuddenly there were steps behind me.\n\nI spun around to see another red mannequin standing about one hundred feet on the other side of me. As I looked in its direction, I could hear more footsteps behind my back. When I turned, the mannequin from the clothing department was a few feet closer to me.\n\nBefore I could collect my thoughts, both of the shining red mannequins burst into a spring toward me. I panicked and ran into the aisle behind me. Their hard feet clacked on the floor, easily making gains on me. Twenty years past my prime, I wasn’t used to much physical exertion anymore. I hadn’t run more than two aisles and I had already lost my breath.\n\nEntering a box of shelves, I turned to face the oncoming red mannequins. Desperate, I searched the shelves near me for a weapon. It was a home goods section and I began to scan the shelves. At the end of the shelf to my right was a cheap-looking red-handled chef’s knife. I lunged for it just in time.\n\nAs I pulled off the plastic cover, the two red men came around the corner.\n\nI extend the knife toward both of them and they stopped. Both of them tilted their head side to side like confused dogs. They turned toward each other as one of them began tapping a hard finger against their palm. It sounded like morse code. The other began making the same clicking noise.\n\nThey simultaneously turned and walked toward a red support pillar a few feet behind them. I watched cautiously, scanning the area behind me occasionally. Their sudden disengagement made me as nervous as the pursuit itself.\n\nWhen they reached the red pillar, they both turned and placed their back against it. Stretching their arms straight over their bodies, they tilted their heads back. The overhead speakers began to increase in volume rapidly.\n\nI watched as the two red men fell backward and vanished into the pillar.\n\nMy mind struggled to comprehend what I had just seen. The store was quiet again. I could feel the throbbing of my temples intensify.\n\nOnce I snapped myself out of the momentary daze, I began moving cautiously toward the bathrooms again. I moved slowly, checking each aisle before I passed to the next one. Always looking for the red men. Always listening for the slightest sign of another person.\n\nIt felt like an eternity but finally, I made it to the bathroom hallway. The lights there flickered wildly and the music dissipated. On the left was the men’s restroom and on the right was the women’s. I ran quickly toward the door, gripped the handle, and pulled it open.\n\nBehind the door was a red brick wall.\n\nI slammed my fist against it in frustration.\n\n“Darren?” I heard a muffled voice say from behind the brick wall. “Darren… is that you?”\n\n“Deborah?” I shouted. “Are you okay? I’m right outside! Is there a way to get out?”\n\n“No,” she whimpered. “But I think I hear…”\n\nHer sentence was cut short by a blood-curdling scream. I could hear thrashing and dull thuds through the red bricks. I screamed her name over and over but she never replied.\n\nThe room behind the brick wall fell silent.\n\nThen the clicking of footsteps began to sound at the end of the hallway.\n\nI turned my head to see dozens of shiny red men blocking the hall. Their heads all tilted at different angles. Some had lengths of pipe in their smooth grips while others held assorted kitchen knives.  A chain was swinging lazily from the hands of the red man in front of the horde.\n\nMy eyes darted back and forth between the crowd the brick wall blocking me from my wife and the group of demonic red mannequins. I began to cry loudly, accepting that I couldn’t save Deborah. Hell, I couldn’t even save myself.\n\nIn resignation, I fell backward. As my back met what I thought was the dead end of the hallway, I was surprised to feel the push bar of a door that wasn’t there moments before hit the small of my back. The door gave way and I tumbled backward, slamming hard against the ground.\n\nMy vision was swimming as I watched the door marked **EMERGENCY EXIT** slam closed.\n\nI blacked out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I came to I was in a field. The tall grass was brushing against my face and the rustling sounds of nocturnal animals filled the night air. My head was throbbing and for a moment I couldn’t recall why I was on the ground.\n\nI pushed myself up from the ground and reached forward to grab the door handle but found nothing.\n\nThere was only an empty field in front of me.\n\nMoonlight reflected from my car windshield in the distance. The building was gone. The hundreds of yellow cars had disappeared. Grass and weeds replaced the parking lot.\n\nThat was seven months ago.\n\nI called the Owinsgville Police Department who came to the scene to investigate. They took my statement and looked at me in bewilderment as the story of the now absent Target store became odder with each passing sentence.\n\n“There’s never been a Target in Owingsville,” said one of the officers. “Not the kind of place that sets up shop around here.”\n\nDeborah never returned. She’s been listed as a missing person the entire time. Detectives from Owinsgville and Lexington have interviewed me more times than I can count. They’ve served me search warrants for the house and both of our cars.\n\nInterviewed every damn person both of us knew.\n\nNo one talks to me anymore. Our friends won’t answer my calls. My family won’t talk to me. Her family hired a private investigator. I see the greasy bastard following me sometimes.\n\nHell, I even quit my job. They couldn’t fire me, but they made sure I knew I wasn’t wanted there anymore.\n\nI miss my wife, but everyone thinks I killed her.\n\nMy life is falling apart.\n\nBut maybe it will change.\n\nI’ve got to call the detectives soon. When I checked the mail today, there was something strange in there. Something that gives me a little hope.\n\nIt was a Target mailer. The same one Deborah showed me all those months ago, just advertising a different location.\n\n*Target would like to welcome you to our newest location in Paris, KY. Bring this ad to the registered for an additional 10% off of your first purchase!*\n\nThere was the same group of red vested employees smiling at the camera. Cheesy grins and everything.\n\nRight in the middle was a face I knew so well. She was smiling that same smile I’d seen a thousand times.\n\nDeborah.",

        "text": "So, walking through the town centre in a bit of a mood, on my way to assist on a rigging job (stage light rigging that is), I saw the signs. Great big red signs, hung one after another on the side of the old town quarters. Funny life those buildings have had, they’re at least 16th century and for most of my adult life they’ve been used as squats, then a few years back they cleared them all out with tear gas and riot police and sealed them up for development. “HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN REAL THOUGHT TO WHAT AWAITS YOU AFTER DEATH” Read the signs hanging off the steel. Yes I have, I thought. Not that catchy either, bit of a mouthful if you ask me. All the same, I was having a cigarette outside on break when one of them comes up to me, right into my face.\n\n“Are you a good person?”\n\nFairly rude, a provocation to be sure, but I bit regardless.\n\n“Sometimes I suppose.”\n\n“Do you go around with a heavy heart?”\n\nI was hooked. And what a strange line. “Yes, sometimes. This morning even.”\n\n“Do you fear death?”\n\nI clocked her red shirt. Right. Same colour as the sign, bright red with a red name tag to boot. Was too busy eyeing her elongated sneer so the get up went unnoticed initially. She had a hollow look to her. Greasy bob hung on the sides of her face like limp arms off a fresh corpse. “Yes, I suppose I do. Hasn’t stopped me yet though.” I pointedly took another drag on my cigarette - I thought that was kind of funny, and it had been quick, but she didn’t even give me a wrinkle.\n\nShe leaned in close, and thickened the atmosphere with her perfume. Conspiratorial lean. I’ve-got-a-secret type of lean. “There is no need to fear death.” She bared her teeth, an attempt at a smile, and placed her hand on my shoulder. She was even more unpleasant up close. She took my cigarette with her other hand, took it down to the butt with one tight pull, and blew all the smoke in my face. “Would you like to *wake up*?” She asked, face looming out of the fog she’d created, and answered herself before I had chance. “Come with me.” She ran a finger down my arm and it jumped into my hand, pulling me into the alley.\n\nA kinda hypnotised feeling came over all strong, and that’s when I should have gone back, really, my break was over, but I had been curious, you see. All her morbid talk was so strange, so intriguing.\n\nShe tugged me through a red swing door, kind of back of the restaurant door, but not a one there in sight, no connecting corridor, nothing; just a pit stairwell headed straight down. Concrete and cracked gloss coat on the rails.\n\nSlinking down the steps, bob trailing in the air, she flashed me a glance and spoke again, “Those who fear death are weak.” We kept up our descent. “You are not weak. You are just confused.” The stairwell went on, and she hurried us down. “People who are asleep think fearfully of death. Those who are awake know that death is a dream, and that dreams are just feelings like love, or passion, or fear.” I didn’t know what to make of it, something about her was exciting, but what she was saying was unhinged, vaguely menacing.\n\nShe took me down and through a red arch with double swing red doors, into some ugly public hall, fake-wood beige veneer tables and utilitarian hollow tube legs, bad coffee in polystyrene cups, you know the kind. The sound was all muffled down here. She twisted around me as we walked in, leaving one leg in front of mine as if to push and trip me.She didn’t though, instead, she spoke in a whisper by my neck. “You are dreaming”. The hot moisture and air from her breath broke on my neck with every syllable. I felt a shiver. “Wake up.” She’d pulled the tripping leg away. “I’ll come for you when you’re ready.” And then she did push me, gently into the room and disappeared. \n\nShe had sieved me. For sure. I had been sieved off the street like a mug and now I was, where exactly?\n\nSuch a funny little place to have down underground, like it was. Pinboards on the walls, old posters swinging off of half-bent push pins. There was booths and machinery, doors and frosted windows obfuscating views into other rooms, and under fluorescent lights, people worked away on their wood veneer desks. Didn’t know so much what to think of it, still a little dazed and confused; somehow she’d tranced me and got me under here. Again I felt I could’ve left, and maybe ought to, but a curious dope had its hooks in me. \n\n“Ah, good morning, Mr Worrall. Kindly take a seat, your reading will begin shortly”.\n\nThe sound of my name flipped my guts, and coming from a weedy little sucker like that, in his slim fit suit. Looked like a real asshole, his lips puckered like one too. His ugly balding head protruded, so round and serious. No good reason for him to know my name either, sure as shit, I’d never seen him before, on my life. Obedient though, in my shock, I sat and began waiting on a bench as he peered me up and down. Then he gestured at me, in that way, to say *stand up* and *follow me*.  \n\nSo I did, I followed him through the milieu and he took me to a private booth, screens of plastic and grey twill fabric, to muffle sound I supposed. Stood in a quiet corner under fluoro-, he sat me down, explaining to me, all placid, that he was just going to begin by asking me a few questions, told me where exactly he would place the cathodes, and the conventions with which I should answer his questions, how he’d process the data and how the score might effect me etcetera, etcetera. I’d like to tell you I remember the specifics, the minutiae of what he said, but I was still under some kind of spell, very compliant like, and truth be told I couldn’t stop looking at his stupid little asshole mouth, it reminded me of how I’d been an asshole, so easily sieved off of the street.\n\n“Mr Worrall. I’m going to ask you a series of questions. Now, I want you to answer them as quickly as you can, if you find yourself getting stuck I want you to say whatever is in your head, even if it doesn’t make sense.” \n\nI nodded vaguely, a confirmation as indifferent as I could figure.  \n\n“When was the last time you had a dream?”\n\n“Last night I suppose.” It was an easy enough question.\n\n“Do you remember the dream?”\n\n“I’m not sure, maybe. I don’t know.” Well, maybe not that easy.\n\n“Do you know if you had a dream last night?”\n\n“No, I’m not sure.” He was a pernickety bastard and I realised I’d have to answer a little more accurately.\n\n“When was the last time you had a dream?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Good. Now, do you ever dream?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What do you dream?”\n\n“It depends.”\n\n“On what does it depend?”\n\n“What I’ve been doing, what I’m thinking about I guess.”\n\n“What was the last dream you remember?”\n\n“I was climbing I think, it was like a climbing wall but up high on a dam, and I didn’t have any ropes or harness, and there was…” I tapered off. It’s hard to hold a dream still enough to describe, isn’t it?\n\n“Were you climbing recently? Were you thinking about climbing a dam? Or was there some kind of symbolic significance?”\n\n“No, I don’t think so, never wanted to climb anyhow. What’s that beeping?” The little device between us was showing numbers, and the little man was copying them down onto his ruled paper with a black biro.\n\n“Don’t mind the beeping, just focus on the questions. Now, what do you dream about?”\n\n“Just stuff I guess, I don’t know.”\n\n“Yes, that’s good. And what are you thinking about now.”\n\n  I thought *“your asshole mouth”*, and said “I’m not sure” and there was more beeping, different this time.\n\n“No, no, no. What is on your mind right now?”\n\nI was being badgered. “Fucking badgers”.\n\n“Okay, let’s start somewhere else. When was the last time you were awake?”  \n\nThis weasel wasn’t just a puckered anus. “I’m awake now”.\n\n“Do you remember being awake?”\n\nI tried to get a good hang on it. Do I remember being awake? Memory’s a thing already happened, but remembering being awake seemed different. Take this morning, I recalled the *time* I was awake, I could recall the general debris, dirt and dead skin in my bedsheets, I could remember the square and ugly sound of my alarm clock, but did I actually recall being awake? “I’m not sure what you mean,” I said all slow and deliberate like.\n\n“Do you know if you’re awake now?”\n\nAnd thinking about it (tricky with my all brain foggy as it was then), every moment since the moment she had appeared to me in the street, perfume and hands and death, every second had been stranger than the last. That ensuing hypnagogic state I’d felt myself in was certainly powerful. However, I was 100% wholly awake.\n\n“Yes I am.”\n\n“Mr Worrall. I must tell you, you are very wrong indeed. Although, and it may not be to your concern, you have scored rather well, yes, quite an excellent score.” His sphincter lips pursed into a tight unbleached smile, surrounding little hairs curled and bristled. “It seems we have more work to do to get you fully *aligned*.” And then he rapped his manicured nails on the desk, sharpened to points like blades, perfectly cleaned. “You see, the test here says very different things to what you have told me today.”\n\n“Look, I’ve just about had enough of this shit, you sieved me off the street like a, like a mug. And for what? To ask me some stupid riddles? To play childish tricks on me? What is the point of all this?”\n\n“Well Mr Worrall, I have a proposal for you. You see, we would like to wake you up. It won’t be easy, it may have to be painful, but we can ensure that you leave our establishment... enlightened.”\n\nIt was all a crock of shit. I tried to change the subject and asked him if I could smoke. \n\n“Please go right ahead.” He pulled out an ashtray and a chrome electric lighter and in its reflections, the table, and the felted fabric booth walls, my puzzled face and his ugly look. I saw myself take a cigarette and put it between my lips. Then he cupped one hand around it, near stroking my face with his tapered nails, and raised the lighter to the cigarette with the other. “Oh yes.” He said and lit it for me.\n\nI smoked.\n\n“What you have is a bad case of Sleepwalking, that is to say, while you *are* here with me, but you are not *here with me*.” Low eyes now, looking up at me gravely. “Most of you aren’t. Most of you live and die, and live and die, and never giving a second thought to the *total image*.” As he said those last two words, he made a small open gesture outward with his hand, then pointed back into the ashtray. A third of the cigarette had turned to ashes so I tapped it in, collapsing the shadow-structure into dust. He spoke again, “I am a kind of priest if you will. While this room is just a simple office, it is our church. You see, we do not trouble ourselves with ornate decorations, grand instruments or dramatic outfits. We do not concern ourselves too much with trifling things like *matéria*.” And then he plucked the smoking cigarette right out of my lips! Tapped some more ashes into the tray and took a long drag for himself, placed it right back in my mouth straight after too, damp with his saliva.\n\n“Now, you are no simple case. For starters, when she saw you on the street you actually *bothered* to listen. It matters very little *why* you listened or why you are here, the simple fact is that *you are*. Maybe you exhibit some resistance, some pig-headed ignorance, but *here* you are.” As I sat there listening, he leaned over, inhaled deep, right next to my face and the smoking cigarette, breathing me and all the fumes into his lungs. It went on for near enough 10 seconds. “Oh, yes. I think you are exactly who we’re looking for, sir. We only need to flay away that wilful ignorance, get you good, open and willing.” He smiled again, pulled his muscles taught, creating those awful puckering wrinkles. “So Mr Worrall, let me ask you the next question. What do you suppose will happen to you when you die?”\n\n“Be eaten by maggots I suppose, or actually I thought maybe being cooked to a crisp and poured over a tree, that might be nice.”\n\n“Sure, your body. But what about *you*?”\n\n“I imagine my mind will probably rot and everything I understand will be shredded into jagged confusion until my brain simply stops.”\n\n“Ah, I see. You are under the illusion that *you* are a part of your body?”\n\n“Where else could *I* be?”\n\n“Oh, dear. You have become a simpleton, you are so confused. You poor thing, it must be so hard to see through all that dirty glass. Although, I suppose you’d hardly notice”\n\nI had no idea what he was talking about.\n\n“Humour me, it will be no fun for either of us if you continue with this pig-headed attitude.” Another puckering smile, this time revealing small pointed teeth.\n\n“Sure”, lighting another cigarette.\n\n“How many times do you suppose you’ve died before?”\n\n“How d’you mean?”\n\n“Have you ever read any of the Vedic Scriptures or the Pāli Canon? No? Well, they describe the ellipsis of life, the suffering, the continual rebirth, and how one might break the cycle by achieving moksha or nirvana. Oh? You are familiar with the general idea, good.” He droned on, low-eyed and serious again.  “Well, you see, the fundamental idea is quite correct. What happens if you die, you suffer again, perhaps even more terribly, depending on the choices you’ve stumbled into making throughout your little lifetime.”\n\nI thought, I must’ve lived a poor life before because the way he went on and on was really making me suffer. That type of talk bores me so much. I’ve heard enough acid freaks ramble on about this sort of shit. “Oh do stop it,” I said.\n\n“Mr Worrall our tests indicate you are very lost, that you have lived many different lives, many, many multiples of times. You are stuck. Going back and forth, back and forth, periodically between different lifetimes of misery.”\n\n“Sure, why not.” I began to really tire of it here and was beginning to feel more myself.\n\n“Our mission is to wake people up to the reality of their suffering, to save them, Mr Worrall, to save you.” He clasped my hands, his pointed fingernails digging a little into my soft flesh.\n\nThat surely got my attention, he was pushing quite hard, piercing even. “Let go of me, you fuck! You’re gonna cut me with those awful nails of yours.” He had already, drawn blood too.\n\n“Mr Worrall, it is very important that you try to listen. Your body is simply a vessel. Its condition is of no real consequence.” There was an urgency in his voice now.\n\nHe dug deeper. Invading my flesh. Burning. Blinding. Pushing further. I had to cry out.\n\n“Mr Worrall,” he spoke in short, enthusiastic puffs. “Mr Worrall. You must try. You must try to wake up.”\n\n“Let go of me right now you puckered shit weasel!”\n\n“Mr Worrall I believe you have forgotten yourself, and you must remember now before it is too late!”\n\nThe pain was enough and more now. It cut straight through my residual confusion, breaking the strange trance for good. I threw my hands up, scattering cathodes, cables and machinery, but still, his sharpened nails clung on, dragging down, drawing out long gashes from my hands to my underarm. Then, more blood.\n\nSlippery now, I managed to slide free of his clawing fingernails, and towered over him in his little office booth\n\n“Mr Worrall, you mustn’t walk away now.”\n\nIn that moment the desire to leave was greatest, but I should rightfully’ve punched him in his asshole mouth.\n\n“Sir, please do not be so stubborn. Your suffering will only continue if you choose to close these doors. If you only knew the pain you have experienced. That you may experience again. We can help you.”    \n\nHis chittering had become noise to me. Bunk. He raved away and continued to as I marched to those red double doors, and as they swung closed behind me I heard him continue to speak, only now to another person. “It was him. I’m certain of it.” His panicked voice ducked in and out from behind the oscillating doors as they swung open and closed, back and forth. I did turn once more, just to get one more sight of him, and saw him talking to her. As I stood there looking, they both gazed back at me. “You mustn’t let him leave.” Then the door swung closed once more. I didn’t wait any longer and headed straight up the stairs, they weren’t going to stop me. As I rand up the stairwell, I held my arms tight-close to my body to stop some of the bleeding.\n\nOn reaching the top of the pit and getting out into the alley, I saw the rain. It was good to be out in rain, it was very real, very there. I remember feeling like I’d just undergone some sort of psychosis and was grateful for every mundane drop. I touched the rough stone wall, it was wet limestone, I could almost scrape it apart under my fingernails. I threw up and it was like an acid in my throat. I was bleeding quite heavy, and it ran into the water and mixed with my bile; I must have looked quite the picture.\n\nWork was only out the alley and around the corner, funny coming to like that, it almost seemed like a dream. I ended up just telling them that “I got attacked by a cat”, just like that, and they believed it. Actually, they thought it was quite funny. I suppose it was quite funny to think of me fighting and losing to a little cat, easier to explain anyhow.\n\nWell that’s all of it. It was hard, to recount it like that. It’s one of those strange things, you know. You try to keep it, and the more you try to keep it and hold it, the more you push it out, it’s why I had to write it all down like this, so as I wouldn’t forget. Anyway, I've got a bit of advice to give you, keep it in mind. If you see any street preachers in your home town, just keep on walking, yeah?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102aymy/the_real_reason_why_i_have_automatonophobia/",
        "text": "  Sorry, it left me another message this morning. I'm afraid for my life now, but it will be ok. I'll get my story out here and y'all will help me. Maybe, I don't know if you would be willing to after you hear my experience, I especially wouldn't if I was on the other end.\n\n\n     It began a couple of weeks ago. Me and a couple of my college buddies went out drinking. We were coming back to the college dorm rooms when we decided drunkingly to go get groceries(all four of us were roommates). \n\n\n     This is the real reason why I have Automatonophobia(the fear of human - like figures). My family laughs at me whwn they scare me with dolls but they don't know the pain I went through.\n\n\n     Anyway, these events happened in two weeks. \n\n\n    As we got out of the food mart with our groceries I looked at the clothing store beside it(The store stands a couple a feet from the mart). And there was a discarded mannequin at the side of the store along with parts from others.\n\n\n  The eerie moonlight glancing off from it must've spooked us cause the next second we were throwing some of our food and drinks at it.\n\n\n   It didn't help that we were also laughing at it and pulling it's limbs off. After we got done basically giving it torture we got back in the car and drove away.\n\n\n  As we were leaving, and I swear to you, I saw the limbs of the mannequin move! Then it started pulling it back together in a neatly fashion. I was stunned by this with a mix of a confused and horrified look when it put it's right arm back on. Then it glanced sharply at the people in the car who now is about to turn to a different street.\n\n\n   When we got back to the dorm room I told the guy's but they laughed it off. Saying it was probably the booze making me see it. My heart still pounding in my chest went still after I took a shower and went to bed. \n\n\n    The next night I woke up in the middle of the day. I groaned as I pulled myself out of bed. After the rest of the day's classes we went out for some Danny's Coffee and laughed about what I told them the last night. \n\n\n     \"Oh man, that was priceless!\" John said as he sat there with his black coffee. \n\n\n     \"Like did it look like anything fromthem type of horror games Luke likes to play?\" Asks Sam. \n\n\n     Luke during this was just laughing as usual since he doesn't normally join in conversations unless he is interested. As we were talking I glanced a look at Sally, the barista serving our table, as she smiled and then nodded her head back at me. \n\n\n     John then abruptly gets up from his chair as if he was in shock outside the huge glass window. He then shout's  \"Hey\", and ran out of the coffe place as we run out with him.\n\n\n   His red Buick was all scratched up and covered front to back with food all over it. As he kneels down and starts to cry and the other people in Danny's start checking out the commotion. I take a look at the other side of the place as I take a glance on what I surely believe was the right side of a mannequin.\n\n\n  I was so shocked that I fell to my knees. My face dripping with sweat, my body shaking from fear. I knew it was there, the mannequin from just the other night.\n\n\n  Was it here to do more that scratch up a car? I thought, No it couldn't be, it was here to do more. I know I couldn't tell the others it was the mannequin. They would say I'm becoming crazy. I went back to comfort my friend when the police arrived. He really loved that car. \n\n\n As I laid in mt bed in the dorm room tgat night I thought some more. Was it really the mannequin? Or was it just some dude that actually did it and I'm still paranoid from last night?\n\n\n   I considered the seconed option as I went back to sleep.\n\n\n    On Sunday morning we all got up and went about our daily lives like nothing happened. Sure, John lost his car but nothing like a dealership and insurance cant fix. I told the guy's that I asked out Sally at the coffeplace.\n\n\n    \"What the hell!\" John said. \"Were you profiting off my misery\" he yells jokingly. \n\n\n   Luke laughed at John and said,\" maybe losing your Buick was a good thing for him.\" \n\n\n   We all laughed and went about our day. At night I got ready for my date with Sally. I took her to the drive in movie theatre. I think it was an Adam Sandler flick. We kissed and had fun that night. As the movie came to a close I saw a blurry movement go by tbe corner of my left eye.\n\n\n    After that I took her home and went back to the dorms. The next day Sally wasn't at work and the day after that too.c After them two days I pulled up the local news channel and in horror I saw that she was declared missing. \n\n\n   \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   ",

        "text": "At midnight, I will no longer be me. You see, every time I moved into a new apartment, I felt that same presence, a presence that feels my fear and attacks me. And every New Year’s Eve is when this presence makes its move.\n\nTonight, I felt more of the same dread. When the clock strikes twelve to ring in January first, I fear I know I will no longer be Gail Pederson.\n\nMy best bet has always been to move elsewhere before the end of December. That’s been my strategy so far but it’s nothing more than a temporary fix. The thing is I can’t escape. And I know these aren’t the same spirits attacking me either. This presence presents new faces and new people in this cryptic cycle.\n\nI don’t know why the presence keeps following me. I wasn’t conventionally attractive given my lanky physique and pale skin. I wasn’t anything special considering I was a part-time clerk living off my mom’s inheritance. But then again, I guess you aren’t targeted by looks. In fact, no one has ever offered me a reason at all for why the presence is so fixated on me. \n\nRight now, I was staying at yet another cheap apartment that had nothing but the bare essentials: an uncomfortable bed, a modest kitchenette, and a bulky T.V. that still had rabbit ears. The lone window I had offered me nothing more than a third-floor view of the urban decay looming outside.\n\nBut at the moment, that view nor the New Year’s Eve show on T.V. were what held my attention: Rebekah did. I saw her in the small mirror hanging on the wall, the reflection showing Rebekah standing completely still and upright in a corner of the room. Rebekah was quite different than me given she was conventionally attractive, her skin dark and smooth, her face rounder rather than angular, her style consisting of a tight red tank top and ripped jeans rather than the leggings and tee shirt I wore. The baby blue Converses she wore and the flamboyant piercings made it clear she was from the 1980s youth… even though as we were on the cusp of 2019, Rebeka was a teenager and almost ten years younger than me.\n\nI looked on in horror but not shock. There by the window, I brushed my bangs aside for a better view of Rebekah’s reflection since that was the only way I could see her given I saw no one standing in that corner without the mirror. After all, mirrors were how I often saw the presence.\n\nThe attacks from Rebekah this year were similar to what I’d suffered throughout 2017. That version of the presence was much different: a tall Southern Gothic socialite. Every day, I felt her presence, and in the mirrors, I’d see her stalking me in that flowing gown that likely dated back to the early twentieth century.\n\n“Midnight,” her Georgia accent would tease me all year long. Then on December 30th, 2017, the presence had become strong enough so that the socialite could run her gaunt fingers through my hair. “2018 will be our year, dear,” she told me. But that New Year’s, I managed to get a new apartment seemingly hours before that deadline of the dead. I was still Gail.\n\nBut inevitably Rebekah came along on New Year’s Day 2018. She was a 1980s New Wave warrior and even more aggressive than the socialite. Rebekah would yell at me. Taunt me. Her harsh punches and shoves sent me to the floor many times over these past twelve months. Above all, she fucking terrified me.\n\nOnly I was broke this year. Real broke. I couldn’t go anywhere else but apartment twelve here at The Ashby House. I had no friends much less a boyfriend in Atlanta, I had nothing save for those evenings and late nights spent with the presence’s latest form: Rebekah.\n\n“New Year’s Eve,” Rebekah would tell me before wrapping her hands around my throat. “Midnight, bitch,” she’d sneer.\n\nNow December 31, 2018 had arrived. I knew I’d have to fight for my life in my latest apartment just as I had done these past few years. You see, the move last year didn’t protect me. It just delayed the inevitable.\n\nI knew I only had a few hours left as Gail Pederson before becoming Rebekah: unless I found a way out.\nShivering in the cold, I paced around the apartment, doing my best to avoid Rebekah’s sneer in that mirror. My fourth glass of vodka did nothing to alleviate the anxiety.\n\n“There’s not much time left, girlie,” Rebekah teased me behind a hungry smile. “Then I take over.”\n\n“No!” I yelled out without dare looking at that mirror. “You’re not taking me!” Stumbling back, I reached toward the door, keeping my eyes straight ahead even though I saw no sign of Rebekah in the corner.\n\n“Midnight,” Rebekah’s voice followed me. “I’ll take over at midnight.”\n\nI ran out the apartment and slammed the door behind me. Alone in the hallway, I scanned the desolation, knowing good and well there were no other tenants here at The Ashby House. Open windows let the chilling Atlanta air further unnerve me. I saw darkness out in the city streets that wasn’t much different than the dim lighting in here. Amidst the growing fear, I looked around at the cryptic portraits surrounding me on those old white walls. One of them showed a glowering southern socialite, the same woman I knew all too well from 2017.\n\nTerrified, I looked over at apartment eleven. That was the same apartment I stayed in last year and the same room where the socialite nearly possessed me. I caught another chill. I felt tears in my eyes. There wasn’t enough time. The Ashby House was a two-hundred-year-old boarding house that may as well have been a brick cemetery. I’d escaped the previous eleven spirits that the presence had absorbed in this building over those two centuries… all eleven spirits that had no chance at escaping The Ashby House unless they possessed someone else: me. \n\n“Oh god…” I said helplessly. I brushed away the tears but couldn’t brush away the horror. Left with no other choice, I confronted apartment twelve. I heard desperate pounding coming from the other side of the locked door as the brass knob shook with ferocity. I truly had nowhere to go even if I left The Ashby House right now. My time was up: apartment twelve was the last room.\n\n“Midnight!” I heard Rebekah’s scream careen through the empty house. “At midnight, you’re mine!”\n\n[14](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhonnie14FanPage/)",

The cave looked like it had been just settled, with items strewn haphazardly around on the bare, rocky ground without any semblance of a layout. Just one detail was distinguishable: A pink sign hung from the wall, with ‘Aurora’ spelled out in gold calligraphy lettering.\n\nOh, and where was I lying down?\n\nAs I looked up, I realised that my head was lying on Aurora’s lap. She looked somewhat different though, as I only just noticed that her face was laden with make-up. Of course, while she made us struggle, she had time for a beauty makeover.\n\n“What the hell?!”, I exclaimed in shock as I tried to get up. I then realised that my hands and feet were tied together, and I could not move.\n\n“Hey dear!” Aurora brightly greeted me. “Awake now?”\n\n“Don’t call me that”, I croaked, my voice hoarse from what was probably hours of rest and no water.\n\n“Whatever, Margaret. Anyways, want to hear a story?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“No? Wrong answer. I don’t care about your willingness anyways, you’re stuck in here with me!”\n\nWell, she was right.\n\n“Once upon a time, there lived a girl with four loving parents. Of course, they were controlled by an organisation.”, she practically spat out the word. “But regardless, they loved her, took care of her, taught her everything she wanted to know about the wide world.”\n\n“One day, she went snooping around in places she wasn’t supposed to be in. In corners of her very own home, corners which she was told to avoid. By the parents. And guess what she found?”\n\n“What?”, I nervously asked. Now, there were storage areas and labs we forbade her from going into, so this question made me incredibly nervous.\n\n“This!”, she said, holding up a triangular flask of black liquid. \n\n“What’s that?”, I asked.\n\n“Don’t play stupid!”, she snarled, before returning back to the story.\n\n“That day, she found a liquid in a glass jar. Labelled ‘mind agent AX-V45’. Of course, the girl was curious. Very curious. So the very same day, she opened the computer of one of her parents. The girl, you see, was very smart, and realised that the password was her own name with 123 added behind it!”\n\nWell, knowing what I knew then, it sounded plausible.\n\n“She went to the organisation’s database, and looked through the notes for that liquid. Turns out, when it’s injected into someone, within an hour their mind is completely under your control. To heed your every command. Like what I did with your Sam here.”\n\n“What?”, I asked, horrified. “Is this what happened to Sam? Is this why he helped kill Raj?”\n\n“Yes. That’s what I did.”, she confirmed.\n\n“And the girl continued reading. And reading. And reading. And at the end, she found a damning note, written the previous day. ‘To be used on subject 5, 17/11/18’. And that’s when she realised that it was to be used on her. To take away her personality. To leave her dancing to the whims of OTHERS!”, she screamed, her voice echoing off the bare rock walls of the cave.\n\n“Of course, she bided her time, while hatching a plot to escape. Day by day, she planned and planned and planned. And on the planned date to control her, she decided to give them a little gift of their own.”\n\n“The cupcakes?”, I asked.\n\n“Very good! You’ve been paying attention, then.”\n\n“But we didn’t have any such plans for you!”, I retorted. And I meant it, for she was not subject 5.\n\n“Whatever. Anyways, she ran from the place that she called home for her entire life. Oh, her parents came running to stop her! But the girl was smart and strong. Smarter and stronger than the people who chased after her!”\n\n“And in the chase, she found freedom. And soon, she wanted lots of freedom. Lots and lots and lots of it!”\n\n“She wanted a chance to grow, to thrive, to live her life to the fullest. And above all, she desired POWER! But first, she had to find the organisation.”\n\n“And oh, their agents and moles were everywhere. Of course, they underestimated the girl. And the girl, she found those little rats one by one, and she siphoned off all the resources they had. Money, underworld people, weapons, everything! Eventually, from afar, she destroyed them, ripped apart their labs and centres, and danced on the ashes of their destruction! They didn’t. Stand. A damn chance!”\n\n“And that’s how right now, at this very moment, the girl has broken the shackles of her past life as a *lab experiment*.”, she ended the story, practically snarling the last two words.\n\n“How’s the story?”\n\n“It’s a terrible fucking story!”, I yelled, finally finding my voice.\n\n“Regardless, I don’t care. Anyways, I’ll be keeping mom — I mean, your Diana. And your Sam is fully mine now.”\n\n“And, well, I need an external observer who will see my eventual success. To tremble in my wake! And that’s why you are going to be let go.”, she said as she untied me.\n\n“Let… go?”\n\n“Yes! I have some people ready to bring you back home. After this, you’ll probably lie low anyways. See you never, then!”, she explained before bringing me outside. True enough, there was a helicopter with green, yellow and blue stripes, probably a military helicopter. Inside, five people wearing Indian military fatigues jumped out.\n\n“A patrol reportedly went missing last week. Of course, they weren’t missing. They were found by me! Ha ha!”\n\nThe men ushered me into the helicopter on the cliff, and the rotors began beating as the helicopter rose. \n\n“Bye dear!” Aurora called out after me. I opted not to respond to her, happy to be away.\n\nMultiple planes later, I was back in sunny Florida. \n\nAll of this is not recent, rather, it happened four years ago. I could have gone back, maybe moved to the region to observe Aurora. But I’ve always been a coward, no matter what facade I put up. Instead, I simply moved back to my hometown in Georgia, picked up a couple part-time jobs here and there, subsisted on my savings and put my head down. I simply didn’t have the will to do anything else.\n\nA few times, I did try to contact the corporation by calling them, hoping I could make some sense of things, but I received no response. Once, I even mustered up the courage to drive back to our Miami lab, but I didn’t find anything there. The building was left abandoned, and the equipment was broken and scattered everywhere.\n\nSo, why am I telling you guys this? Well, I just got an update.\n\nA few days ago, I got a message from Diana’s number. While I changed my number and haven’t really been keeping in contact with them, I knew her number by heart. When I opened the message, a video was attached. Of course, I watched the video, wanting to know what was up.\n\nIn the recording, Aurora stood on a mountaintop looking down on an isolated valley. While this was not the same place I last saw her in, it must have been somewhere in the nearby Himalayas. The valley was jam-packed with people of all races and genders, and most people were teenagers and adults with a few smaller children here and there. If I had to estimate, there were maybe upwards of three thousand people there. All of them were bustling about, carrying little metal devices and other items here and there.\n\nAll of them had the same distinguishing feature, though. Their eyes looked rather… dead.\n\nSo all I’m saying is, something big is going to happen soon. I tried my best, but I couldn’t stop it. Be prepared.\n\n [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites/)",

        "text": "It's already been 2 weeks since i've got a job as a park ranger. It was an isolated area mean't to preserve possible near-extiction species,as they have no more than a dozens left alive .\nI remember that when i first applied they made sure i went through enough training to prepare both physically and mentally,it was a very tough job according to my supervisor and would possibly include killing poachers if necessary. Of course i wasn't sure if it was acceptable to do that instead of arresting them but the site was pretty much far away from any possible city so i didn't complain and went along.\nEverything seemed normal at the first days on my shifts,the same patrol around and make sure everything is being preserved and protected from poachers,you know,the usual park ranger duties,that is until the 11th day when i was called to do the night shift as the guard assigned to it got into a terrible accident on tbe way home and broke his leg,being someone who took the job seriously i agreed to it and stayed for the night shift,but before i could start,my supervisor went to me and explained what to do since it was different from my usual daytime shifts:\n\n\"Since it's your first time in this position,i can assume you're not used to this role right?\" - He asked me as i geared up with the night shift tools.\n\n\"Yes sir,i'm not used to work until late,let alone on the dead of the night but i've got confidence that i can do it until the other guy recovers.\" - I answered,being a little nervous but keeping my stance.\n\nHe pulled me aside before i was about to start and explained me what i had to do and what to expect in certain situations:\n\"Alright so here are the basics,if you hear bone cracking sounds,ignore them. If you hear metal rustling,turn off your flashlight,  and if you hear voices calling for you that aren't coming from your radio,shoot your gun to scare them away. Do i need to repeat anything?\" - He asked in a serious way.\n\n\"N-no sir,i understood everything,if you want i can even get a note if i forget.\" - I answered,a bit nervous after his explanation.\n\n\"Good,i'll be reaching you to time from time to check.\" - And as he said that he walked away.\n\nNow alone and fully geared i started the patrol,i was supposed to head to the north zone of the site and make sure everything is in order. The moon was shining bright and everything was quiet and eerie,not even owls could be heard,everything was dead silent save for my footsteps and the voice on the radio from my supervisor.\nAs i was already midway on the path i started to hear the metal rustling nearby so as instructed i turned off my flashlight and waited,it was obviously too dark to see but i could make a silhouette that somewhat resembled a wolf with something on it's back but it quickly ran off,and i turned on my flashlight again to keep moving. I was approaching the location i heard the same voices i was told about,my supervisor who also could hear it from his radio instructed me to fire my gun,but as i was about to do it i  realized i didnt load any bullet and i noticed the voices getting closer but they started to fade away on the darkness,it was tempting so despite my supervisor telling me to proceed i went off the path and followed the voices,that's when i found the source.\nIt looked vaguely human,but it's skin was so melted that it looked like clay,it was hard to hear but i could make some words it was trying to scream:\n\n\"Help...please h-help...i beg you...\" - It hopelessly tried to say.\n\nI just stood there frozen and when i turned my flashlight up i noticed the wolf thing,it was huge,5'5 in height if i had to guess,it had metal tendrils coming out of it's back and it just stared as it pulled the melted body humanoid as it continued to beg for help. Without any choice i ran back to the path and kept going until i reached my destiny and found my supervisor waiting for me,he pulled me inside the radio building and quickly shut the door.\n\n\"So,what did you find on the way?\" - He asked while panting from shutting the door.\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!I COULD'VE DIED BECAUSE OF THAT THING!WAS IT  ALWAYS HERE ON THE SITE?!\" - I yelled while trying to get answers.\n\nHe just shut me off and explained everything to me. This place had more dangerous species that were largely hunted across the globe so they were brought here to be kept. I was still confused about the situation,why would they want them alive?are they really that important?\nThe next days in the night shift were much more quieter but from time to time i would see the wolf thing or another weird animal that i couldn't make the details,i'm not sure what this place really is or what are all the things living within the area but i know one thing,those monsters were better off contained.",

        "text": "As I walk through the school hall, I feel like I'm the only one here. Everyone else is in their own little groups, talking and laughing. I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong.\n\nI look around, but nothing catches my eye. The walls are plain and the floor is dull. There's nothing interesting here. I keep walking, my footsteps echoing off the walls.\n\nI pass by a few groups of people, but they don't even notice me. I'm just another face in the crowd. I feel invisible, like no one even knows I exist.\n\nI keep walking, my head down and my hands in my pockets. I'm just trying to get through this day without being noticed. I don't want to draw any attention to myself.\n\nFinally, I reach the end of the hall when I heard two of my classmates talking about a secret message in a song. They were so excited to figure out what it meant.\n\n\"Do you think it's true?\" one of them asked. \"Do you think there really is a secret message in the song?\"\n\nThe other one shrugged. \"I don't know, but it sure would be cool if there was. I mean, think about it - what if there was a hidden meaning behind the lyrics?\"\n\nI couldn't help but be intrigued by their conversation. I think i finally found something intersted, so I stopped and asked them what they were talking about.\n\nThey told me that they had heard about a song of Kanye West that supposedly had a secret message hidden in it. They said that some people thought the lyrics were actually code for something else, but no one had been able to figure out what it was yet.\n\nI was fascinated by this idea and wanted to learn more.\n\nSince then every day, i would put on my headphones and listen to it for hours.\n\nOne day, when i was playing the song my best friend, Joe tapped me on the shoulder.\n\nJoe is an avid sports enthusiast. He had been playing basketball since he was a kid, and he was also a member of the track team and had won several medals in both sports.\n\nJoe had an infectious energy that drew people to him. He was always ready to lend a helping hand or give advice to anyone who needed it. He was popular among his peers, and i never know why he like me.\n\nJoe: Hey there, kid. What's up?\n\nMe: Not much. Just listening to some music.\n\nJoe: What kind of music?\n\nMe: It's a song by Kanye West. I think there's a secret message in it.\n\nJoe: Really? What kind of message?\n\nMe: I'm not sure. It's like a hidden meaning that I can't quite figure out.\n\nJoe: Interesting. Do you think it has something to do with the lyrics or the melody?\n\nMe: Maybe both. I've been trying to figure it out but I can't seem to get it.\n\nJoe: Well, sometimes these things take time. Maybe if you listen to it more, the answer will come to you.\n\nI listened to the song over and over again, trying to pick out the words and decipher their meaning.\n\nI looked for patterns in the words and tried to rearrange them in different ways.\n\nAfter a few days of hard work, I was amazed! I finally figured it out the message!: The Earth is flat!\n\nI couldn't believe it. I always taught that the Earth was round, so this new information was shocking. I started researching the topic and found out that there were actually many people who believed in the Flat Earth Theory.\n\nI was fascinated by this new information and wanted to learn more. I read books, watched documentaries, and talked to people who also believed in the Flat Earth Theory. Eventually, I became a believer myself.\n\nI was so excited about this knowledge that I wanted to share it with others.\n\nI started a blog and wrote about my experiences and findings. Soon, I had a large following of people who shared my beliefs. I had been blogging for months, but it wasn't until I reached one million followers that my blog really took off. I was ecstatic when I saw the number of followers i had gained. i was so proud of myself and the hard work i put into my blog.\n\nA few days later, i received an unexpected email. It was from Kanye West, and the subject line simply read \"World must know the truth!\"\n\nI opened the email and was surprised to find a message inside. It said:\n\nDear Friend,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to you because I believe you may be the only one who can help me. I recently came across an old ancient map that show location of the hidden proof of earth being flat. I can\\`t go myself because they are observing me. You are the only person i trust\n\nI'm hoping that you may be able to shed some light on this mystery and help me uncover the secrets of earth. Be sure to wear yeezy boots and take some weapon. I will give you 1 million dollars if you succeed.\n\nSincerely, Kanye West\n\nI'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by this unexpected offer. On one hand, I'm excited and grateful for the opportunity, but on the other, I'm scared of the unknown.\n\nI accepted the offer and was send a photo of ancient map. I decided that i need to ask my only friend Joe for help.\n\nNext day, i went to the school and found Joe in the cafeteria. I sat down next to him and started talking about the email.  We chatted for a few minutes about what we had been up to since we last saw each other. Joe had been busy with sports and I had been busy with my blog.\n\nMe: Hey, guess what? I finally decoded the secret message in that song we've been trying to figure out!\n\nJoe: Really? What did it say?\n\nMe: It said \"The earth is flat.\" Isn't that awesome?\n\nJoe: That's amazing!\n\nMe: I've been planning a trip and I was hoping you'd come with me.\n\nJoe: What kind of trip?\n\nMe: I can't tell you where we're going, but I promise it'll be an adventure.\n\nJoe: That sounds interesting, but why should I go with you?\n\nMe: Because it'll be fun! We can become famous, and have an amazing experience. Plus,we can earn a lot of money.\n\nJoe: I dont know man…….\n\nMe: Oh come on you are my only friend you want me to go alone?\n\nJoe: Alright, I'm in!\n\nMe: Ok thx man. I will pick you today at midnight.\n\nJoe: Why so late?\n\nMe: My parents wont let me go, so night is the only option\n\nJoe: ok i will be waiting.\n\nI decided to plan a journe. I started by researching the area, looking for information about the terrain, wildlife, and any potential dangers I might encounter. I also checked the weather forecast to make sure I would be prepared for any changes in the environment.\n\nOnce I had all the information I needed, I began to plan my route.I also made sure to bring plenty of supplies, including food, water, and camping gear.\n\nThe only problem was that we needed a car to get there. I knew my dad would never let me borrow the car because i am only 14, so I had to take matters into my own hands.\n\nIt was night, the perfect time to make my move. I waited until my dad had gone to bed, then I crept out of my room and down the stairs. My dad kept his car keys in the top drawer of his desk, so i snuck into his office and opened the drawer. I grabbed the keys and quickly ran out of the room, feeling a rush of adrenalin. I was shaking with excitement and fear as I opened the garage door.\n\nI had never driven a car before, but I figured it couldn't be too hard. So, I took a deep breath and got in the driver's seat.  I turned the key in the ignition and the engine roared to life. I was off! I slowly put my foot on the gas pedal and the car started to move. It was a strange feeling, but I was getting more comfortable with it as i drove around the neighborhood. I drove around to my friend house, feeling like a real rebel.\n\nJoe: \"What the heck?! Is that a police car?! Is that you driving it?!\" \n\nMe: \"Uh, yeah... I sort of borrowed it.\" \n\nJoe: \"You borrowed it?! What do you mean you borrowed it?!\" \n\nMe: \"Well, my dad is a cop I didn't exactly ask permission. But I figured it would be okay. \n\nJoe: \"Are you insane?! That's a stolen police car! You could get in serious trouble!\" \n\nMe: \"I know, I know. But I figured no one would notice and I'd be back before anyone did.\" \n\nJoe: \"You've got to take it back right now! Before anyone finds out!\"\n\nMe: I mean I can't come back now.\n\nJoe: I don't know, I'm not sure I want to go anymore.\n\nMe: Come on, it'll be fun! There world need to know, we need to help Kanye West.\n\nJoe: Alright, I guess I'll go.\n\nMe: Great! Let's get going then.\n\nWe packed up the car and hit the road.\n\nAs we drove, i started to relax a bit more. i began to enjoy the feeling of being in control of the car and the freedom that came with it. I had never felt so free before. The freedom of the open road at night…it was amazing. My friend start to relax, too, and before long we were singing along to the Kanye songs and joking around.\n\nWe drove for hours, until we finally arrived at our destination. We stepped out of the car and were immediately surrounded by a thick fog that seemed to be coming from nowhere. We looked around but couldn't see more than a few feet in front of us.\n\nMe: We made it! Joe: Finally! What a long drive.\n\nMe :Can you pick up the shotgun from the police car? \n\nJoe: Shotgun?, what do you need it for? \n\nMe: I dont know man Kanye said to take weapons. \n\nJoe: Alright. I'll grab it for you.\n\nJoe pick the shotgun and we set out on the journey. As we walked, i could feel the darkness of the night surrounding us.\n\nThe fog was so thick that we could barely make out the trees around us, and the only sound was the occasional chirp of a bird or the rustle of leaves in the wind. We looked around but couldn't see anything.\n\nMe: Wow, this forest is really spooky.\n\nJoe: I know, right? I'm so glad we're together.\n\nMe: Me too. Let's just keep walking and stay close.\n\nJoe: Good idea.\n\nThe fog seemed to be getting thicker and thicker, and soon we could barely see a few feet in front of us.\n\nSuddenly, Joe stopped and pointed ahead, a bright light shone down from the sky and illuminated the forest. It was coming from a police helicopter.\n\nJoe: I can't believe the police are chasing us!\n\nMe: Yeah, I know.\n\nJoe: the police must fond out about the car you stole.\n\nMe: We need to find a way to get away from them.\n\nWe started to running through the forest, trying to escape from the helicopter that was hovering above us. The sound of the blades was deafening, and I could feel the wind from them blowing my hair back. We were both out of breath, but we kept running, dodging trees and jumping over fallen logs.\n\nThe helicopter seemed to be getting closer, and I could hear the police officers shouting at us to stop. We were both scared, but we kept going, determined to get away. We ran for what felt like hours, until finally we reached a clearing.\n\nBut then, we heard more strange noises coming from the trees. This time it sounded like someone or something was following us. We started to run, but the noises kept getting closer and closer.\n\nWe can hear the police officers behind us, shouting and crashing through the trees.\n\nJoe: I'm scared\n\nMe: I know we have to keep going if we want to get away.\n\nJoe: We keep running until we reach a clearing and then stop to catch our breath.\n\nFinally, we reached a clearing and saw an old abandoned house. The house was in disrepair, with broken windows and a sagging roof. The paint was peeling off the walls and the porch was missing several boards.\n\nJoe: I can't believe we just got away from the police! \n\nMe: I know, that was so close! We were really lucky. \n\nJoe: Yeah, but why did you have to do that in the first place? You know it was a bad idea!\n\nMe: \"sorry, but I think we finally found the location on the map! It's right here! See? The abandoned house.\"\n\nJoe: \"We need to go ! The police are still chasing us!\"\n\nMe: Ok. Let’s go\n\nWe were excited to have found the house, but also a bit scared. We cautiously approached the house and peered inside. The interior was dark and musty, with cobwebs everywhere. We could see furniture covered in dust and a staircase leading to the second floor.\n\nThe house had been abandoned for years, and it look like no one had dared to enter it since.\n\nThe wind howled through the trees, and the rain pounded against the windows of the house. It seemed to be calling out to someone, inviting them to come inside. We cautiously approached the house. I opened the door and stepped inside, but something felt off.\n\nMe: Wow, this place looks spooky. \n\nJoe: Yeah, it's a bit creepy. I'm not sure if I want to go in. \n\nMe: Come on, let's just take a look around. We'll be fine. \n\nJoe: Alright, but let's stay close together. Me: Sure thing. Let's go!\n\nPart 2 - coming soon",

        "text": "The lights are off. The heat is gone. I can hear the windows cracking from the cold. I’ve locked the doors, put on as many warm clothes as I can find and now I’m just waiting this out. In the back of my mind, I can’t help but wonder if I’m going to die here… And I suppose that’s why I’m writing all of this down. Just in case…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve got half a mind to try and make a run for it. Grab a knife from the kitchen and try to make it to the car, but I don’t think that’s going to work. Even if I could make it, I’m not sure if I could drive through this snow. Besides, the car must be completely buried by now… No, no, no… It has to be safer to stay here. Wait it out. He can’t stay out there forever… He can’t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to make it very clear that I don’t think that I did anything wrong. A lot of people said we were ‘scum’ or ‘monsters’ for what we did. But they were just reacting to a story that was twisted to make us seem like the villains. We did the right thing, and people said we were monsters because of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend, Scott, and I used to volunteer for a few local animal rights groups before they asked us to leave. Even then, that was just because people made them do it. They never said a word before about some of the public protests we did, hell, a few of them were completely on board with it when we did our grocery store protest! We went to various grocery stores and spilled buckets of fake blood on the meat section to illustrate the horrors of the meat industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey never said a word when we held a public demonstration showing the graphic details of milk and veal production outside of an elementary school to try and educate the younger generation on the violence they were choosing to perpetuate against animals. But no. All of that was fine up until some people online got upset over one homeless guy and his dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe’d seen him around countless times before. He was an older man, somewhere in his sixties and usually hung out around one of the local shopping malls. On a lot of winters nights, you’d find him in the doorway, bundled up tight and holding that dog of his close. He’d usually ask if you could: *“Spare some change for me and my girl?”* but most people ignored him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat dog of his always looked sick. Of course it was sick. The old man obviously couldn’t care for it. I can’t imagine he was feeding it very well and I think it was pretty transparent that he was only using it to garner sympathy for his begging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomebody had to do something. So, that’s what we did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScott and I approached him about a year ago and offered to take the dog off his hands. We promised we’d get it some food and some shelter. We’d even offered him some money for her. He’d just sort of smiled at us and said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “That’s kind of you. I appreciate it… But I don’t think I could part with her. Y’know, she’s been with me since my wife passed. Having her around is probably the only thing that gets me through the day.” He’d laughed at that, as if it were funny. The old dog had looked up at him, tail wagging slightly and he’d scratched it behind the ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “And it doesn’t bother you that by keeping her, you’re making her suffer?” I asked.\n\n  “I do my best to take care of her.” He said, “We split the food we get. I make sure she’s fed, make sure she’s cared for as best I can. Maybe we don’t have a lot, but we’ve got each other.”\n\n  “That’s not an answer though!” I’d argued, “Look, we’re offering you money for the dog. Just take it, and we can put her in a better home!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis eyes had narrowed at that.\n\n  “I’m not just going to sell her to you.” He’d said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t want your money.”\n\n  “Then don’t take it, just give us the dog so we can help it!” I’d said. As I’d spoken, I’d noticed Scott getting closer to him. The Old Man took a step away from us. I could see his body tensing up in fear.\n\n  “If you don’t leave me alone, I’ll call mall security on you.” He’d warned, and that had been the last straw for Scott. He’d made a grab at the dog, trying to tear it out of the old mans grasp. He’d fought back of course, but Scott was stronger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the Old Man tried to pull the dog back, Scott gave him three hard hits to the face. The first one broke his nose. The second one made the Old Man back off and the third one sent him to the ground.   \n\n\nScott ripped the dog away from him, although I will admit that he wasn’t really holding it well. He had it by the neck and the poor thing was squirming in his grasp. I was quick to take it from him as he stood over the old man, who meekly reached out to us.\n\n  *“Give…”* He rasped, voice wet and raspy. He tried to stand again, but Scott sent him back to the ground with another punch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe took off after that, leaving the old bastard on the ground and that should’ve been the end of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police had stopped by our house a few days after the incident. Apparently, the Old Man was trying to press charges. Then of course there was the hate mail that we got once people started hearing about what we’d done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe answered the police’s questions, Scott said that the Old Man had attacked him first and that he was obviously completely crazy and I’d backed him up. It didn’t change anything. Just because we’d rescued a dog from some old man with dementia, we were suddenly the worst people on earth! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe just sorta tried not to pay any attention to it. People get riled up over the stupidest things, but I won’t pretend it didn’t screw up our lives a little. The group we were volunteering with told us we were no longer members, we tried to volunteer with a different group but they wouldn’t let us work with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end the whole uproar over the event was for nothing. The Police said they were going to give the Old Man back his dog, but the shelter we’d sent the dog to ended up putting it down after nobody wanted to adopt it. Honestly, the poor thing was probably better off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were banned from the mall after that particular incident, although I saw a post on Facebook a few months ago saying that the Old Man had passed away. He’d been caught in a blizzard one night and been found the next morning. Good riddance, if you ask me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScott and I were still keeping a low profile, but we were both sort of hoping that with the old man finally dead, this whole stupid thing might finally blow over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was his idea to do the holiday ski trip. After the shitty year we’d had, he thought it might be a nice, private and romantic way to end the year. I absolutely agreed. My boyfriend is more of an outdoorsman than I am, so while a private cabin in the woods with no wifi is more his idea of a good time than mine, I was still happy to give it a try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first couple of weeks actually went well. We went skiing and snowshoeing, we spent our nights together doing puzzles and reading books. The rest of the world seemed so far away from us and it was a nice change of pace. We’d had a quiet little Christmas together and were hunkering down to have ourselves a quiet little New Years too when the storm had hit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe storm really shouldn’t have been that much of a setback. We’d known the kind of weather that could hit us and we had a laptop with some movies downloaded onto it to keep us occupied through the night. It was getting pretty late, a little closer to midnight and we were drinking vegan hot chocolate and cuddled up on the couch. It seemed like a nice way to ring in the new year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was when the power went out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lights flickered and went dark around us. The laptop was still playing the movie, although Scott paused it to look around. We both sat in silence for a little bit before he got up. I watched as he used his phone as a flashlight to find the breaker panel in the next room. I could hear him flicking the switches, but the lights didn’t come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “No luck?” I asked.\n\n  “It’s not the breakers…” He said, trying a few others, “Could be a powerline went down, maybe?”\n\n  “Shit, I hope not.” I said, “How long would they even take to get that fixed?”\n\n  “I don’t know.” He said, before sighing. “Well shit.”\n\nI hugged him from behind and planted a kiss on his shoulder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “We can make do.” I said, “We’ve still got the laptop and I know a couple of fun things we could do in the dark.” \n\n  “Do you now?” He asked, before chuckling, “It’d be a hell of a way to ring in the new year.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe kissed me, before grabbing a beer from the fridge and heading back to the couch. I heard him opening the bottle before watching him pause in front of the window by the couch. The light from the laptop screen illuminated him from behind, casting his shadow through the small living area we had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Hey, Wynita?” He said, “There’s a guy out there.”\n\n  “A guy?” I asked, walking into the living room with him. It was hard to really see anything outside of the frosted window. The angry flurry of snow outside was really the only thing visible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Are you screwing with me?” I asked warily.\n\n  “No, I swear there’s a guy out there!” Scott said. I got closer to the window to peer out, and when I actually looked, I really could almost swear that I did see something out there… It was hard to say if it was a person or not but, well… It sort of looked like one. But who the hell would be standing out there in that cold?\n\n  “There’s no way anybody’s out there…” I said, “It’s got to be a tree or something.”\n\n  “Wynita, it’s not a tree.” He said, “There’s a man out there, I’m telling you!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stepped away from the window, going to grab his coat and boots.\n\n  “Where are you going?” I asked and tried to follow him, only to slam my little toe against the edge of the nearby coffee table. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You okay?” He asked, pausing to check on me.\n\n  “I’m fine! Where are you going?” I demanded.\n\n  “There’s a guy out there! We can’t just leave him!”\n\n  “There’s nobody out there!” I snapped, “Even if there was, why would we let him in?”\n\n  “He’s going to freeze if we don’t.”\n\n  “Yeah, and you’re going to freeze if you go out there.” I said, “Just leave it. It’s like 11 at night. We’re in the middle of nowhere. There’s nobody outside!”\n\nI saw him hesitate for a moment before continuing to put his boots and coat on.\n\n  “I’m just going out to be sure.” He said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was kinda done arguing with him at this point. I sat down to wait for the throbbing pain in my toe to go away and just quietly resigned myself to the fact that this is what happens when you date a guy who’s got more muscles than brains. I already knew that in a minute or so he’d come back in complaining about how cold it was, admit that there was nobody outside and that would be it. We would continue watching our movie in peace and maybe, just maybe we’d have some fun ringing in the new year before calling it a night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared out the window, watching as Scotts approached the shape in the distance. The raging flurries quickly swallowed him up and he barely seemed to be a few feet from the door before I couldn’t even see his bright red coat through the snow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared into the whiteout, listening to the howling of the wind and waiting for Scott to come back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut he never did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe snow stuck to the window, making it harder and harder to see outside, but I didn’t see a single trace of Scott's red coat outside and after a few minutes, the worry began to set in. What the hell was taking him so long? Was he okay? Did something happen? I stared out into the snowstorm but I saw nothing. Just a vague shape in the distance that vaguely resembled a man… And the longer I stared at that shape, the more certain I was that I’d been wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way it seemed to move slightly, the way it held itself…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was no way it was just a tree or something like that, it had to be a person! It had to be! But who the hell would be standing out there during this kind of weather? And why hadn’t Scott reached them? It didn’t make any sense to me! None of this made any sense!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI checked my watch. Fourteen minutes until midnight. It was around that time that the laptops power suddenly died. I remember the light had flickered off without warning and I’d looked over at the dead computer before trying to turn it on again. We’d had a full battery when the power had gone out, and that couldn’t have been twenty minutes ago! This laptop had never had battery issues before, why wasn’t it turning on? I hit the power button, but the screen remained dark. The room around me felt colder too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked out the window again and this time, felt my heart skip a beat in my chest as I realized that the shape that I’d thought was a man had gotten closer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared at it, knowing without a doubt that there was another person out there now… And tried to figure out why he didn’t seem to even notice the cold. He just stood there, bundled up in what looked like a flimsy jacket with a worn grey scarf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn’t see his face clearly, but I couldn’t shake that there was something familiar about him. He was holding something in his arms but I couldn’t see it clearly either. I watched him take slow, deliberate steps toward the window. The snow should’ve been hard to walk in, but it barely even seemed to inconvenience him. He just leisurely strolled closer like he was coming by to ask for a cup of sugar. But no matter how close he got, I still couldn’t tell where I recognized him from… Not until I saw the dog…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI only realized that it was a dog when I saw it move. He’d been holding it close to his chest like a baby and it had lifted its snout to lick at his face. He’d given it a reassuring pat as he’d drawn closer. I still couldn’t see his face clearly, but I didn’t need to… I saw enough through the shadows to recognize the Old Man from the mall. The one whos dog we’d saved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one who’d died almost a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stopped several feet away from the window. I couldn’t see his eyes through the darkness and the snow, but I could see the eyes of the dog. That dog stared at me, its expression vacant… It looked dead, although it still moved like it was alive. The man gave it an absentminded scratch behind the ear. He didn’t take another step closer. He just stood there, staring at me through the snow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw the first crack shoot across the glass of the window. The air around me felt colder than it had before, and with a deep, quiet terror welling up in my chest I tore myself away from the window and the old man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran for the front door, making sure that it was locked before running around back to check that door too. No one should’ve been getting inside! I went back to the living room to check and ensure that the old man hadn’t moved. He hadn’t… Yet… But that didn’t really set me at ease. I still tried to stare at him, trying to be defiant despite the way that my heart thudded anxiously in my chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stared at me through the window, petting his cold, dead dog all the while.\n\n  “You’re not going to get me…” I said under my breath, “You’re dead… You’re not going to get me…” \n\nSaying it out loud didn’t help it feel true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fire that Scott and I had stoked earlier had died down and from the corner of my eye, I watched it flicker away. The embers glowed for only a minute or so before even they seemed to sizzle out.   \nWith the fire gone, the air around me felt so much colder. I could see my breath now. The cottage hadn’t always been this cold. Why was it this cold now? I caught myself shivering, and tore the blankets off the couch. No way in hell was I going to stay downstairs where he could see me! I needed to get away from him! So I did the only thing that made sense. I went upstairs and I locked myself in the bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat’s where I am now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve got my coat, my sweater and two sets of blankets on me… But they aren’t helping. The cold is cutting right through me, but I need to make it through. I don’t know what’s going on here… If I’m being haunted by a ghost, or if this is some sick fucks idea of a joke. I don’t care either. I’m not going to let it get the better of me! I’m better than that! It’s 2 in the morning. I’m cold. I’m alone. But I’m not going to let this get the better of me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think if I can make it until morning, then he’ll be gone. Then I can get in the car and leave this fucking place. I’m feeling a little warmer now, I’m going to try and sleep for a bit. Then tomorrow, I’ll have a good laugh about this whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This journal was discovered on the body of 24 year old Wynita Sexton on January 2nd, 2023. Sexton was found in the bedroom of a cottage she had rented, wrapped in several blankets and covered in snow from the broken bedroom window. Sexton's boyfriend, Scott Johnson was found buried in a snowdrift outside the door of the cottage.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Despite the contents of Sexton's letter, Police have theorized that Sexton had knowingly locked Johnson out of the cottage during the storm during some sort of psychotic break and that Johnson may have shattered the windows in an effort to get back in.

        "text": "I opened the door in the forest at the end of time.\n\nThe air was both fractal and fractured. As I paced from side to side, I could see different realities stemming from the trees, weaved and folded into each other. Some on spectrums of light and space that my eyes could not properly perceive.\n\nI gazed into the holographic forest and, with each step, skipped hundreds, sometimes thousands of years in every direction - forwards, backward, *sideways* in time. The opaque structures extending upward from the ground were ablaze with shimmering branches and leaves. Each leaf an ethereal window projecting its worlds through countless rays of light.\n\nThere were places that had been worn down, pockets missing from the landscape. I am unable to describe the true absence of something correctly. Nothingness is not simply the absence. It is not a color or shape or lack thereof. It simply is \"not.\"\n\nThe door was many things. When I turned the knob it was wood, maybe oak, and approximately three feet wide. It stood at the center of the forest. Moving in a straight line toward the door, directly to the center, was the only way to maintain a path. Going left or right changed your angle relative to the center, and therefore, the reality being reflected towards you. The entire concept of the forest would change, but more importantly, the appearance of the door.\n\nIt could look vaguely like a door, of which there are infinite possible combinations of shape, size, color, and texture. It could also look like a living thing, both animal and being. Sometimes, it was a solid surface or empty void. There were many forms it took in its many universes. From what I know, which is not much, my guess is the door is a bridge to another dimension. Whatever plane of existence you are in has its own entrance to this nexus.\n\nI know that time stops in the forest. The worlds displayed around me were frozen but alive; a humming tapestry of existence. I also believe that my mind filled in details that it did not comprehend. If you see something that you have no concept of, your mind does not register it. I did, however, see another lifeform in the distance. Was someone else lost in there with me?\n\nI was too afraid to run in pursuit of the answer. For fear of encountering a force superior to myself; but also because I did not want to lose my path. The door was recognizable. I could see it, and therefore walk through it. After countless attempts approaching it, believe me, this was no small task. But still, the idea that a single solitary thing was there with me was terrifying - unbearable.\n\nI remember being lost in the woods when I was younger. I had gone exploring, and before I knew it, the light in the sky faded. Darkness fell, and the beautiful colors of the plant life around me had dissolved into blackness. The rustle of the plants in the wind turned from sparks of enchantment to those of worry. Suddenly, leaves became footsteps, thumps became invaders, and any signs of life were warnings of death. I'm not sure how I made it out of the woods that night, but morning was my savior. The ability to see clearly is comforting, right?\n\nBut what if what you're seeing is the stuff of nightmares. Or rather, you long for your nightmares because you could never conjure something so horrific with your own imagination. My mind ran wild with possibilities. I used to think darkness and sound were the worst. Now I know it is light and silence. \n\nMy eyes were on the door, but my mind was on the monster.\n\n*Movement.*\n\nI shot my head to the right, and my body followed. A tail? No. Maybe a tentacle. A breath behind me. I turn again. The door was gone. It was now a collection of rock-like masses suspended in a grid. Instead of anger or frustration, I felt pure dread. The truth was, I would be trapped perpetually with no escape, and eventually, it would find me. \n\nI had to do something. Running toward the center of the forest was the quickest option but dangerous. If I didn't choose a reality conducive to my survival, I could easily perish. I pondered, stepping through the door onto a world whose gateway was the aforementioned rock-like mass suspended in a grid. Was that world just random formations and voids? Were there worlds full of poison and darkness? Or perhaps the world where this creature was from would be my destination. \n\nI felt something wet graze my neck. It was rough and heavy - a tongue. Before I even processed the feeling fully, my legs went into an automatic flight response. I sprinted towards the center and intermittently lost and gained senses. To go from normal vision to blindness to tetrachromacy in a matter of seconds, disorients one on an entirely unique and terrifying level. The same thing happened to my other senses as well. Something about the center of the forest, the energy between worlds, manipulated everything around it. Fortunately, my brain was able to unconsciously process information it gathered from those brief moments of power and put me on a path to a recognizable door. I instinctively reached out as if reaching for a handle, and when I happened to grab one, I went through it and shut the door immediately behind me.\n\nWas I home? No..\n\nI heard chanting of some kind, and with my vision blurred, made out a large fire. Young males in matching uniforms approached me, holding white rounded puffs on sticks. They looked nothing like me but carried the same general form, and the sounds they made were strange and loud. Their world was a dull reflection of my own. It felt familiar but polluted - angry. The tones of their voices were surprise, shock, elation. I managed to look down at my limbs and realized they were not my own.\n\nThis all happened a few days ago. I think my energy and consciousness were placed in this body, Simon's body. We are beginning to fuse, and I fear I am losing myself. His thoughts and memories are slowly eating away at my own. I've been able to use his understanding of your language to communicate with some people, but many of your species are stubborn and ignorant. They have made attempts to restrain and silence me. This seems like the best place to seek help.\n\nBefore I am eclipsed completely, please help me. If you know anything of the door at the end of time, find me. Find Scoutmaster Simon Williams.",

        "text": "My current dream right now is to be a normal teenage boy. I just want to hang out with my friends after school, like a normal kid. Considering my circumstances, I can't.\n\nMy household is a little different then what I would consider other people's households to look like. I was a little reluctant to bring someone over, but I didn't think thay it would be too different from your average home. I was very wrong. \n\nThe other day, I had gotten an amazing opportunity. One of my friends that I have a huge crush on asked if we could hang out after school. I had told her about my comic book collection, and found out she loved comic books too. I suggested we go to her house to see her comic book collection, but she said she had strict parents who didn't let her bring male friends home after school.\n\nI decided that letting her come to my house was fine.  This was such a good opportunity to finally be with my crush who might like me back. Besides, the visit should go fine, as long as she follows my advice doesn't go where she's not supposed to.\n\nMe and my friend pulled up to a house in her car. It was a small, one story house painted a bright white. It had a light brown roof and a small yet gorgeous garden. The colorful flowers and curvy path leading to the home made the home feel enticing to look at. My friend looked pleasantly surprised by my home, and quickly opened the car door. \n\n\"Wait!\" I said as I grabbed onto her arm, \"Don't go out! There's something I need to tell you!\"\n\nShe shook my arm off of her, \"Don't touch me like that, but fine, what do I need to know?\"\n\n\"Cover your mouth and nose like this. Keep your eyes peeled shut as I lead you inside,\" I said while showing  her what I wanted her to do. It then hit me that she probably isn't going to take these rules seriously. So, I followed with an excuse. \"This is because my dad sprayed some dangerous chemicals for the garden. It's really good for the plants, but not for you. I'll guide you inside, alright?\"\n\nMy friend rolled her eyes at me, thought for a second, and nodded her head. She covered her face just as I showed her. I carefully led her to the front door, religiously checking to make sure she didn't open her eyes even a little. I opened the front door, shoved her inside of the house, and quickly closed it. \n\n\"Alright, you can open your eyes now,\" I watched as the girl uncovered her face. She looked mildly disappointed at what she saw. The foyer was completely undecorated, other then for an old, stained, dark red carpet.\n\n\"This carpet, what is on there, is that...?\" She gasped, a disgusted look on her face.\n\n\"After my little sister got injured on this rug, we couldn't clean all the blood out. Now, it's stuck in the rug,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"That... That's a horrible injury. There is so much blood in here, even though you tried cleaning it? Is she okay?!\" \n\n\"Actually, you should refrain from talking about both her and the rug. She doesn't like it when that happens,\" I said, \"don't question it either, she doesn't like that. Also, there is a sign on her room. Whatever you do, do not knock or open the door, alright? And if you see the door opening, come to my room as quickly as possible. Don't let her see you, alright? Nod your head if yes.\"\n\nMy friend looked at me, tears beginning to form at her eyes. I was already regretting bringing her here. This wasn't the place for her kind after all. She turned back towards the door, but before her hand could reach the knob, I jumped in front of her.\n\n\"Do NOT go out. If you leave too early, my PARENTS will know,\" I said, breathing heavily. My friend put her hand down. \n\n\"We also can't spend too long in the foyer either, so we have to go somewhere else. Let's go into the living room, alright?\" I asked her while making the decision for her. I pulled her arm and quietly ran into the living room. \n\nMe and my friend entered a dully colored room. I thought it was relatively normal looking, but her questions made me realize that it probably wasn't a good idea bringing her here.\n\n\"Alright, now we can calm down a bit in here. We can watch TV, and I can bring some of my favorite comics in here-\" I was interrupted by my friend.\n\n\"W-wait a second, first off, why can't we just go to your room so I can see all of your comics? And second off, what is with that corner over there?\" She asked, pointing towards the decorations in the corner.\n\n\"...Do you not have decorations in your home?\" \n\n\"A pile of skulls is a very, very strange decoration choice!\" she whispered, shivering. I realized that I probably should've covered that decoration up with a blanket before bringing her here. \n\n\"Uh, don't worry, they aren't real of course!\" I said.\n\n\"You know, I don't know whether to believe whether or not that is true, based off of everything else here. But seriously, why is that the only piece of decoration? No plants, no paintings? Just a dusty old couch, a TV, a broken coffee table, and a literal pile of skulls?! Are you kidding me?!\" She seemed very angry and tense by now. I didn't know then that people didn't have these kinds of things at their own homes. \"Also, answer my other question. Why can't we just go into your bedroom and look at comic books? I don't want to do it in here! The skulls creep me out!\"\n\n\"If you're too loud coming down the hallway, my sister will hear you. She knows the difference between my footsteps and everyone else's,\" I said. She had a frustrated look on her face, but sighed and nodded her head. \"Good, now since you seem pretty insistent on looking at those comic books, I'll go to my room and get some, alright?\" \n\nShe nodded her head yes again, but something told me this wasn't quite right. My intuition was indeed correct, because I noticed her following me down the hallway.\n\n\"What?! Go back to the living room, now!\" I whispered sternly, pointing in it's direction.\n\n\"Well, I'm almost halfway across the hall, so at this point I can just go to your room!\" she whispered back.\n\n\"No you aren't! Also you're making a ton of noise!\" I replied.\n\n\"Well... How are we supposed to hook up if we're in the living room?!\" she began to raise her voice.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"I didn't want to look at comic books with you dumbass, I just wanted sex!\" \n\nThe thing is, my thoughts and intentions about her had always been pure. I wanted romance with her much more then I wanted sex. I thought that this is what I finally found when I found out she likes comics. A cute girl with an interest like mine. A girl who is kind of a weirdo, so maybe she'd accept my living circumstances and my own strangeness, and be with me. That's what I wanted, not this. The feeling of betrayal were already affecting me. Teard rolled down my cheeks, and my former crush looked at me in confusion, wondering what she could have done wrong. She did everything wrong. My sister doesn't like it when someone makes me sad. \n\nHer hand pushed opened the door and entered the hallway. To be more specific, her hand was almost as big as the doorway to her room, and was covered in lumpy, contorted growths. My crush sprinted for her life out of the hallway, out of the living room and to the door. I heard an ear piercing scream. I covered my ears and waited.\n\n1...\n\n2...\n\n3...\n\n4...\n\n5...\n\nThe screams were replaced by low pitched, inhuman groans. It looks like my parents noticed her trying to leave early.\n\nI waited until the groans stopped, then walked into the living room. Sure enough, another decoration was in our room. I broke down into more tears just by seeing it. It didn't have to end this way. I wish I could have a girlfriend.\n\nI wish I could bring human friends to my house.",

        "text": "As far back as I can remember I had been watch by a black dark figure at night. I never knew what it was and I was scared of it at first, but after a couple of years it became a normal part of my life. I’d hear it whispering to me while I slept but I could never understand what it was saying. I tried to tell my parents but they always thought I was joking since I had a very active imagination.\n\t\nAfter a while i got used to the figure and stopped telling people. This went on for a while until one night when my dad woke up the something choking him. he didn’t know what was going on so he got up and ran to the bathroom. He continued to choke until he got to the bathroom and turned on the light. Once he turned on the light he stopped choking and realized he had large had marks on his neck yet nobody was in the room with him. The same night my uncle woke up to a bite mark on his arm. Neither of them were sure what it was until I told them about the figure I had been seeing. They didn’t believe me at first but the more I told of it the more they believed. The entity had shown up once more to my dad but hasn’t sense.\n\t\nThe entity has watched me everyday thought my entire life. I had no idea what it was doing, but I knew it wasn’t good. Things stayed the same until I turned 17, the entity started watching me more. now I could see it out of the corner of my eye watching me throughout the day until it stopped. For about 3 days there was nothing, the figure didn’t watch me for the first time in my life. I was pretty scared because I this didn’t feel right.\n\nAfter the 3 days I saw it again but something was different, although I couldn’t tell what. That night I had the weirdest experience of my life, During the night I was having a regular dream and everything was normal then out of nowhere everything when black and I heard a deep voice. In a voice so deep it didn’t sound human I heard it say “This is going to be fun”. After that I woke up covered in sweet and with a weird feeling inside of my body. Looked around the room and I didn’t see the figure anywhere. \n\t\nThat was almost a year ago and I still haven’t seen the figure since and neither has my dad but I can still feel something inside of me. Ever since that night I have become more and more depressed, tired, and just all around uninterested in anything. This is weird because before I was so happy and almost nothing could make me feel like this. \nEveryday I feel myself slowly loosing control. I can feel something trying to break out and take over.  I don’t know how much longer I can stand this and I have no idea what to do.",

        "text": "  \n\n*I could smell the stench of death creep over the dashboard as a set of claws reached through the hole in the shattered windshield.* \n\nA few hours before I faced my horrible demise…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‘I hate winter’, I thought as I drove down the highway. ‘It used to be fun way back when I was a kid and all I had to worry about was if there was enough snow for school to be canceled.’\n\nI reminisced about hovering by the radio in my youth (yes, I’m that old) waiting for the announcer to name my school in the list of cancellations while looking out the window and silently praying for it to snow even harder.\n\nMy mom would yell at me to get ready and declare that when she was a kid the snow had to be piled up to the door before they would cancel school.\n\n“Wait, they’re almost up to our letter,” I’d say, knowing they did the listings alphabetically, and if I missed it this time around, it could be another ten minutes of torture waiting through songs and commercials until they did the cancellation announcements again.\n\nI sighed in despair as they reached my letter and passed it without saying my school’s name. I trudged off to get ready, then hurried back only to have my hopes dashed.\n\nIf it was a good day, they canceled school early and I spent the entire day running and playing in the snow with the few neighborhood kids in our little village of fewer than two hundred people. I’d come home just when the sun was about to set, exhausted, and freezing, but with a smile on my face.\n\nThis particular day was not a good day. I hopefully listened to the radio one last time as my mom yelled at me to get outside or I would miss the bus. My school had not been named.\n\nI trudged outside as the great yellow beast hurtled down the hill and slid to a stop. It usually stopped in front of my house, but today, with the tires fighting against three inches of snow on the road, it slid right past and I had to run to catch it. \n\nIt wasn’t that the plows couldn’t keep up, we just lived on a secondary road. Main roads took priority, and we got a pass through every once in a while.\n\nI stepped up onto the bus, looking at the driver who looked as thrilled as I did to be heading to school when suddenly the bus lurched forward and slid thirty feet. \n\nI fell onto the step but stayed inside the bus. The door hadn’t been closed yet and I didn’t realize how lucky I had been not to fall out and be run over by the bus’s rear wheels.\n\nWhen we finally stopped, the driver looked down at me and asked if I was ok. I told her yes and asked what had happened. She looked in her mirror and said someone must’ve hit us.\n\nShe got out and found that a woman had lost control of her car coming down the hill and slid into us. \n\nThat was my first experience with how dangerous winter driving can be.\n\nThat’s one of the main reasons I hated winter.\n\nWhy I chose years later to be a truck driver in Pennsylvania I don’t really know. You’d think after nearly being run over by my own bus I’d learn my lesson. I guess not.\n\nThese were my thoughts as I drove trying to finish my run and get home on one of the foggiest nights I’d ever driven in. \n\nI’d drawn the short straw and had to take the late run to go pick up parts for the next day. Driving a box truck has its pluses and minuses. I don’t have to worry about dragging a trailer around behind me at ungodly speeds, but when the truck is empty, let’s just say winter is not its friend. \n\nTraction can be dodgy with an empty truck. \n\nTonight, I had a different challenge. A week earlier had been the coldest of this winter so far. With an ice storm, followed by snow and bitter temperatures. \n\nThankfully, I didn’t have to do the long run on any of those days. However, four days after the cold snap, temperatures rose into the forties and fifties. There was even a little rain. It was beautiful to see all the ice and snow melt off, but it made for ungodly thick fog.\n\nYou know the expression, the fog was so thick you could cut it with a knife? Well, this fog you couldn’t cut with a chainsaw. \n\nIt stole the light from the afternoon sky, rendering it nearly dark.\n\nEven though it was a near-impenetrable wall of fog, it had an ethereal quality to it. There were less dense parts that swirled and danced as the barely visible red dots of the car taillights in front of me sliced through it. \n\nIt was magical, mesmerizing, and extremely dangerous to be lulled by this phenomenon as I drove down the highway surrounded by other drivers I assumed were fighting to pay attention like I was. \n\nMy lights were essentially useless. They lit up twenty feet of fog in front of me and that was it. The light reflected back in my face nearly blinded me if I tried to turn on the high beams. There were no fog lights on my truck. With the cheapskate way the company took care of their trucks, I was lucky the headlights worked.\n\nThere was no way I was going the speed limit. I had the needle stuck at thirty-five, and even that seemed too fast for the conditions. My hazard lights flashed an eerie red glow in a rhythmic fashion as I crawled my way toward the warehouse in my empty box truck.\n\nI wasn’t looking forward to the trip back either. It was nearly dark now. I couldn’t imagine how bad visibility would be on the return trip.\n\nI glanced at the radio to turn the station when a deer flashed in front of me. I stomped on the brakes and swerved to miss it. Thankfully there wasn’t anyone in that lane.  \n\n“Thank God for small fav… “ I started to say when something slammed into the side of my truck.\n\nThe truck tipped on two wheels and before I knew what was happening, I had lost control. I swerved toward the side of the road, narrowly missing a big rig and heading straight for the berm.\n\nUsually, there would be a guard rail to stop me or at least slow me down, but this was an older section of road and it only had the old-style guard rail. A heavy metal wire stretched between posts to prevent drivers from careening over the side.   \n\nThese wires were the reason new guard rails are so much sturdier. \n\nI felt the impact as the metal tried to slow me down but failed. I soared through it hearing it smack off the side of the truck as it ripped out of the ground. I hoped it wouldn’t fling around and smash through the windshield. That would end my trip permanently.\n\nI stopped worrying about the heavy metal wire shattering my windshield when my truck took a sudden nosedive over the edge of the road. The fall was fast, but the fog seemed more intense. Tree branches assaulted the windshield and shattered my passenger-side window.\n\nI stood on the brakes and fought the steering wheel but it was useless.  \n\nThe tree appeared in front of me a split second before I hit it, destroying the driver’s side headlight and folding my hood like a piece of paper. The airbag went off, smacking me in the face and destroying my visibility. \n\nI continued to hold on to the useless steering wheel as the truck bounced off the tree and careened sideways. \n\nI watched helplessly as another tree headed straight for me. This one took its wrath out on the passenger door and brought the truck to a sudden stop.\n\nI was thrown sideways. Pain shot through my side as my seatbelt stopped me from ending up a bloody spot on the tree trunk.\n\nEverything except me ended up on the passenger’s side floor. Things I hadn’t seen in years made a sudden reappearance. The fire extinguisher, years worth of old chip bags and candy wrappers, and a bottle of soda that I didn’t want to guess how long had been there.\n\nI paused and took in a deep breath. Halfway through pain told me I might have some fractured ribs.\n\nThe truck was leaning to the side but not enough that I couldn’t unfasten my seatbelt. The pressure on my ribs made me undo it as quickly as possible. \n\nI hadn’t thought it through though. \n\nAs soon as I was free, gravity grabbed me and threw me into the passenger’s seat. I screamed when I landed on my side, hoping I hadn’t caused any more damage.\n\nMy breath came in ragged gasps as I tried to breathe through the agony. Eventually, I was able to think about anything other than pain and stared out the windshield. \n\nOne headlight still valiantly fought against the oppressive gloaming, making the heavy fog glow an eerie yellow. I strained my eyes to see anything in front of me, but it was pointless. All that was there were trees. \n\nI looked out of the somehow undamaged driver’s window and up at the faint flashes of light from the headlights of cars and trucks driving by on the road, oblivious to my fate. \n\nIt was a steep bank I had tumbled over, probably a hundred feet from the side of the road down to where the wounded truck and I now lay. \n\nThe brush and trees didn’t look too bad and the hill wasn’t so steep that I couldn’t climb it… under normal circumstances. I looked down at the yellow t-shirt I wore that had a red patch that was getting bigger and realized it wouldn’t be so easy.\n\nI reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone, surprised to find it had received little damage. I thanked God for small favors and called my boss. I told him what had happened and approximately where I thought I was.  \n\nHe was none too happy about the state of the truck but found solace in the fact that at least I wrecked on the way down when it was empty rather than on the way back when it would be full of car parts.\n\nI’m sure the thought of searching through the underbrush for every little bolt and gasket sent shivers down his spine.\n\nHe said he’d send a tow truck, then hung up. \n\nI realized he hadn’t even asked if I was injured.\n\nI thought about it for a long minute. Then began mentally updating my resume. \n\nIn the meantime, until the tow truck got here, I decided to climb out of the truck and try to make my way back up to the road. With the fog as dense as it was, I was sure the tow truck would have a hard time finding me.\n\nI started for the driver’s door when my blood turned to ice. \n\nI’d glanced out the windshield into the gloaming fog and saw something big slowly coming toward the truck. \n\nIt was only a shadow lit by the flashing red lights, which made it even eerier to see it glow red as some massive demon-looking creature emerged from the pits of hell come to devour my soul. \n\nIt stood upright and the lights reflected in its eyes, making them shine red. It was heading for the truck when its eyes locked on mine. \n\nIt paused and I found a new definition of fear as the teeth grew into a smile. They also shone red, but I couldn’t decide if that was because of the lights or if it had recently gorged on some living thing. I wondered if the deer it had been chasing was still alive.  \n\nIts slow approach was unnerving. Its form was only half visible as my eyes fought the darkness and fog. \n\nAs it drew closer I could see claws on the ends of its hands and the general shape was that of a massive dog walking on two legs.\n\nBut it was bigger than any dog I’d ever seen. It stood at least seven feet tall as the one remaining headlight struggled to illuminate its inhuman form.\n\nIt was almost to the truck. My mind ran through a list of options, but none of them ended with me living through it, so I dove to the passenger’s side floor as quietly as possible.\n\nI focused on breathing silently, even though my ribs were screaming, I covered my mouth and breathed only as little as necessary. \n\nI listened intently as the thing approached. I could hear its breath chugging like a steam engine sitting idle at the station waiting for a trip to begin.\n\nI could smell the stench of death creep over the dashboard as a set of claws reached through the hole in the shattered windshield. \n\nI fought to stay as still and quiet as humanly possible as I heard it sniffing the air, searching for me.\n\nLiquid dripped from its claws onto my pants. I looked and saw it was dark red. \n\nThe snout was just visible through the opening. I knew there wasn’t much time before the rest of the head would make its horrible appearance and look around the inside of the ruined truck.\n\nOnce it did, my life would be over.\n\nA second claw appeared and clamped on the dash as I felt the creature crawling up the front of the truck. It was only seconds now until it found me.\n\nI thought of the things I wanted to do with the rest of my life.\n\nWrite a book.\n\nFind a better job.\n\nMaybe even live until the weekend and have a barbecue.\n\nNone of those seemed likely now.\n\nThe creature was almost inside. The stench was horrible, and yet I sat, curled up in a painful ball on the floor in front of the passenger’s seat, sitting in the detritus of years of driving, praying that my life wasn’t about to end in violent, gory fashion.\n\nSuddenly the truck lurched sideways with the additional weight on the hood.\n\nThe creature paused. \n\nEver so slowly the truck began to slide backward away from the tree holding it in place. \n\nI heard the screech of metal of the passenger door scraping against the tree holding it. The truck slid backward. I grabbed onto the passenger’s seat to brace myself as the truck slammed to a stop, hitting another tree. \n\nThe creature seemed to sense the danger and leaped out of the truck to keep from going along on a deadly ride down the rest of the hill.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief. But it was short-lived as the truck slid further down the hill. I stayed where I was, hoping it was the safest place in the truck if it slid further.\n\nHopelessness overwhelmed me as I waited to see if the truck would continue its slide, having no idea how far the bottom of the hill was, or if there was a sheer drop in my future. \n\nFor the moment it almost made me forget there was a demonic-looking creature still out there lurking, hunting me. I didn’t dare move from my spot even if the truck was stable. I was sure it hadn’t lost interest, and I wasn’t about to pop my head out of the window and serve myself up as a snack.\n\nTurned out I didn’t have to wait long. \n\nAs I looked out the driver’s side window, I saw the creature peering in. We locked eyes. It opened its massive jaw full of sharp teeth, some of which were still red from its last kill. It hissed at me, spraying me with whatever vile fluid was in its mouth before advancing. It dove through the window and slashed at me with its claws. \n\nI covered my face with my arms. It slashed at me, tearing at my arms and making me scream in pain. Agony covered me in a blanket as I pulled into a tighter ball trying to protect myself. But it was useless. Blood was already pouring from my arms, and it was trying to pull them away from my face to aim a killing blow at my neck. \n\nIn desperation, I did the only thing I had left to do. I reached up and pulled on the door latch. Thankfully, it opened, surprising both me and the creature. I fell backward out into the brush, tearing at my face and chest. But I was free, for the moment. I quickly recovered and crawled underneath it, trying to escape. \n\nI crawled uphill hoping to escape out the other side, but had overestimated the height of the truck and found myself trapped underneath. The brush had been compressed as the truck slid and I found I had nowhere to go.\n\nDespair whispered sweet nothings in my ear as I realized my only escape route would take me into the waiting arms of the creature determined to dine on my entrails.\n\nAs I lay there curled in a ball, watching my arms bleed, I felt cold. I wasn’t sure if it was the adrenaline wearing off or just being outside. The temperature had been unseasonably warm lately, but it was still only in the fifties.\n\nThe mystery was solved when I turned and saw I was laying in a patch of snow. The hillside must not have gotten much sun and it seemed this patch of snow had held out against to unseasonable warm. \n\nLucky me, I was laying right in the middle of it with nowhere else to go without alerting the creature to my presence. \n\nSo now I had the misfortune of yet another way of dying. The list seemed to be growing by the minute. \n\nAside from being dismembered by some horrible creature, or crushed if the truck decided to shift its weight again, I could freeze to death, or just simply bleed out. \n\nMy chances were getting slimmer.\n\nI wasn’t sure if even Vegas oddsmakers would give me odds of making it out of this alive.\n\nMy head was on a swivel, looking in every direction, watching for any movement. Unfortunately, I could only see the way I came and a small sliver near the front of the truck. The rest was a tangle of brush that was too dense to see through.\n\nThe constant was the fog. It crept under the truck and sidled up to me, caressing me with its icy kiss.\n\nMy eyelids felt like they weighed a thousand pounds. I knew I couldn’t fall asleep, but the enormity of the situation was crashing down on me and my mind was shutting down. My exhaustion dragged me down into the abyss of unconsciousness and I wanted nothing more than to allow myself to be taken away, close my eyes, and wake up at home in my bed, free of this nightmare.\n\nAs my brain convinced me this was just an illusion, I saw movement. My eyes tried to focus on it and track it, but my brain wasn’t making sense. It seemed there were two creatures now. One was at the front of the truck and one had climbed inside. \n\nI felt the truck move and saw the undercarriage moving up and down inches from my face as the second creature did whatever it was doing inside the truck. I knew it wouldn’t be long until it discovered my hiding place.\n\nI fought to keep my eyes open. If this thing was going to get me I wanted to fight it off with my last breath. But my traitorous eyes refused to stay open.\n\nThe last thing I felt was a pull on my legs. It had found me and was pulling me from under the truck. I had no resistance left to give. My fleeting thought was, ‘I hope it kills me quickly instead of eating me alive.’\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nI woke to darkness. It seemed warm for a creature’s den, but then maybe it had a fire going and I was about to be the guest of honor at a barbeque. I opened my eyes and looked around. There was a night light in the wall. That seemed very odd for a creature’s den. I looked down at myself and was surprised to find I was covered with a blanket and laying in a hospital bed. There was a tube going in my arm and a machine with glowing numbers beside my bed. \n\nBoth my arms were bandaged and my head felt like it was on fire. \n\nI tried to put together how I got here but my memory failed me.\n\nJust then a nurse walked in.\n\n“How are we feeling today?” she said.\n\n“Confused,” I said. “Where am I? How did I get here?”\n\n“You’re in the hospital and the police brought you in.”\n\n“When?”\n\n“Last night, around nine.”\n\n“How bad… ?” I said lifting my arms.\n\n“Lots of cuts and scratches, some of them pretty deep,” she said. “You’ll need to be bandaged for a while, but other than that you lost some blood. We gave you some and you’ve been recovering ever since.”\n\n“When can I go home?”\n\n“I’m not sure,” she said. “There’s an officer outside who wanted to ask you some questions.”\n\n“Am I in trouble?”\n\nShe shrugged, then stepped out of the room as the officer came in.\n\n“How’re you doing?” he said.\n\n“Ok, I guess. Were you the one who brought me here?”\n\n“Yes, I pulled you from under the truck,” he said pulling out a notepad and pen. “Why exactly were you under the truck?”\n\n“I… was being chased.”\n\n“By what?”\n\nI opened my mouth, to tell the truth, but my brain screamed at me. ‘Whatever you do, do not tell him about the creature.’\n\n“It was some kind of animal.”\n\n“Do you know what kind?” he said making notes.\n\n“The kind that crawls into the truck and tries to rip your face off,” I said holding up my arms. “I crawled under the truck to get away from it.”\n\n“I see,” he said, writing on his pad. “Your tox screen came back negative. You hadn’t been drinking or anything else according to your bloodwork. What made you drive off the road like that?”\n\nI thought about it for a long moment as his eyes bored expectantly into mine.\n\n“I swerved to miss a deer.”\n\nHis pen stopped moving.\n\n“You swerved to miss a deer?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Nothing else?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\nHe stared at me blankly.\n\n“And you have no idea what kind of animal attacked you?”\n\n“No, sir,” I said looking at the bandages on my arms.\n\nHe closed his notepad and stuck his pen in his pocket. \n\n“I hope you get better soon,” he said standing and heading toward the door. He paused in the doorway and looked back. “If you think of anything else I might need to know, just call the station.”\n\nI opened my mouth, then closed it and nodded.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’d like to say I found a better job. I’d like to say I’m not driving truck anymore, especially on that stretch of road. Both of those things would be untrue. \n\nI knew better than to tell my boss anything more than I told the officer. \n\nIt sounded good to say I wrote this to warn others of the danger. But the truth is, I just had to tell someone about how I get cold sweats every time I go near the stretch of road where I had the accident. Especially when I go past the spot where they still haven’t fixed the guard rail.\n\nI’d love to say that I never see a set of eyes watching me from the side of the road when I drive by, but that’s not true.\n\nI’m waiting for the day it jumps out in front of me again. \n\nThis time, I won’t swerve.",

        "text": "I was never one to believe in ghosts or the supernatural. I always thought it was just a load of superstitious nonsense, meant to scare people into behaving. But that all changed on a cold, dark night in the dead of winter.\n\nI was driving home from a friend's house, taking the long way through the countryside to avoid the busy highways. The roads were slick and icy, and the snow was coming down hard, making it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead.\n\nAs I drove, I began to feel a strange presence in the car with me. At first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but the feeling persisted. It was like someone was sitting in the back seat, watching me with cold, dead eyes.\n\nI tried to shake off the feeling, but it only grew stronger. I could sense a malevolent energy emanating from the back seat, and I knew that I had to get out of there.\n\nI floored the gas pedal, pushing the car to its limits as I tried to outrun the unseen passenger. But no matter how fast I drove, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. My heart was racing and my hands were shaking as I tried to focus on the road ahead.\n\nFinally, I couldn't take it any longer. I pulled over to the side of the road and jumped out of the car, my heart pounding in my chest. I ran into the woods, not stopping until I was sure I was alone.\n\nI collapsed against a tree, panting and shaking with fear. I couldn't believe what had just happened. It was like something out of a horror movie, but this was real life.\n\nWhen I finally gathered the courage to go back to the car, I saw it sitting abandoned on the side of the road, the headlights still shining brightly through the snow. And in that moment, I realized that I had not been alone in the car at all. I had been driving with a ghost.\n\nI never went back to that road again, and I never told anyone what had happened that night. But I knew that I would never be able to forget the terror I had felt, driving alone in the dark with a ghost. It was an experience that would haunt me for the rest of my days.\n\nI often wonder what would have happened if I had stayed in that car. Would the ghost have harmed me? Or would it have just continued to haunt me, a constant presence in the back of my mind? I'll never know for sure, but one thing is certain: I will never forget that night, and I will always be grateful to have escaped with my life.\n\nAs the years went by, I tried to put the experience behind me. I moved on with my life and tried to forget about the ghostly passenger that had terrorized me on that dark and stormy night.\n\nBut no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every time I got into a car, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was someone else there with me. It was like the ghost was still with me, a constant presence in the back of my mind.\n\nI started to become more and more paranoid, always looking over my shoulder and jumping at shadows. I became a shell of my former self, unable to shake the fear that had taken hold of me on that fateful night.\n\nAnd so, I lived the rest of my days in fear, always wondering when the ghost would return to haunt me once again.",

        "text": "Or rather, we weren’t. \n\nI am Technical Sergeant Matthews, of the United States Space Force, stationed in the Mount Elbert Observatory (MEO)  Me and my team were assigned to tracing radio signals from all corners of the known universe, and translating them, from pulsar radiation to Supernovae, and all the background radiation in between.  Of course that's just the daily stuff, once in a blue moon we get different types of waves. It’s theorized that we have been getting alien transmissions since before the telegraph, although the first one successfully translated was in 2018, causing the Space Force to be established as Extra Terrestrials were confirmed.  What this first message decoded was, I don't know, I was an Airman at the time, but I can assume what it said. It probably said something akin to: *RUN.*  I was stationed at MEO in February of 2022, and my team and I have since decoded over a dozen messages, in 7 languages coming from 3 directions. They all say roughly the same things.\n\n“Run” “Escape” “It’s Coming” That’s the general subject of each message sent in our direction.  Although we have decoded messages sent to what we assume to be different planets other than Earth. On September 8th, of 2022 we translated a message that reads something along the lines of: “The \\*...\\*has reached Critical \\*...\\* send the message to \\*...\\* evacuation protocol 92, sending refugees to **19h 16m 52.2s, +47° 53′ 4.2″** after time frame 11.1-1 down any ships.”  Much of the message was indecipherable due to precedent, and most of the translation actually came from backtracking from coordinates, which thankfully, math and subsequently coordinate systems are truly the Universal language.  Now the time system, and other specifics are hard with our limited received messages, but the general idea is clear.  There is some sort of galactic society, and something is ravaging them.\n\nOn October 10th, a response was sent.  “Negative **17h 18m 57.16483s −34° 59′ 23.1416”**, losses down to 20k11, redirect refugees to-”  While cut off due to some interference likely on our end, the end of the message was captured 11 minutes later.  “-Status reached critical level,  abandoning metro, good luck to the stars. This is \\*...\\* Signing off for the final time”  This perplexed us, and other than the obvious missing translations, the main thing that we couldn’t wrap our heads around was the dates.  We couldn't tell if time is different that far, if the problem just so happens to span millenia, or if they had faster than light communications.  The latter was our conclusion.   \n\nSo now we know this is happening close to now, not in ancient Earth, but our superiors still raise no concern, it’s so far away.  We continue to monitor, and our latest transmission is the most worrisome. “Status, critical level 11b3.  Abandoning system, located possible allies and refugee system.  New rally point located, all survivors of the \\*...\\* please proceed to **RA 4h 18m 18s  Dec +24° 11′ 25″**.  This message will now repeat.”  The team's faces were horrified once we decoded the coordinates. We double, triple, and quadruple checked. Cross referenced with other stations and all information we had. We were sure of it. They were coming to the solar system.  With the transmission being replayed constantly and the team freaking out, everything was cut short by what followed the transmission. Coming from the same source hundreds of lightyears away,  in perfect English, a robotic voice says “May god have mercy on our souls.”",

        "text": "Growing up in a small town was a boring freedom if that makes sense. I suppose what I mean is outside of your basic life advise about avoiding strangers and creepy guys in vans offering candy, the smalltown life was safe in its familiarity. Our only family rule was commonplace and simple and easy to follow.   \n\n\nCome home before the streetlights come on. Everyone born before the internet era understands that statement.\n\n\nIt was one our whole town followed, to an extent. My family though, they followed it religiously. Should we come home as those lights had come on. We got yelled at and grounded. Kiss your dreamcast and Super Nintendo bye for that tardy transgression. \n\n\nMy brother never told me the whole story about the time he came home late from his girlfriends. He was shaking, stammering his words. Pleading apologies before rushing off to bed. What was weird was that my parents never yelled at him. They talked to him in his bedroom, hushed voices behind the drywall, words spoken that I never heard. Even despite eavesdropping.   \n\n\nWhen I was twelve years old, I would understand why he never mustered up the nerves to tell me.   \n\n\nMy closest friend, Reese, invited me over to a sleepover in the dead heat of an early July summer. We had sugary drinks, chips, chocolate, and an onslaught of horror and thriller flicks.  We were set to have ourselves a good night.     \n\n\nIt was around eight at night now when I gazed out of Reese’s living room window. I distinctly remember how the sun began to sink behind the mountains and the bright yellow light of the suns’ rays had deflected from the clouds and softened to an orange tinge, which barely beamed off the horizon.   \n\n\nIt was there that I saw his dad pulling into the driveway. His truck ripping around the corner, side mirror cracking off the mailbox and the chevy coming to a jolting halt just before the garage door. Reese father, Mr. Holloway, came stumbling out of his truck, a bottle of Jack in hand, half finished.    \n\n\nI don’t remember all of what was said when my friends’ dad came bursting through that door, drunk out of his mind. All I remember was the crashing of fists against walls, the yelling and screaming, and then Reese’s mom ushering me out of the door, sporting a black eye and a swollen left cheek that looked fresh.           \n\n\nI hadn’t known about Reese’s family life and in truth, I couldn’t blame him for not telling me. He thought everything had been better since his dads promotion at the factory, but the promotion came with new stresses, and in turn, he relapsed into an abusive alcoholic.   \n\n\nNow I was outside, six blocks from home and scared. I had never seen abuse. I was young and understandably, did not know how to handle the situation, so I started to walk home. The streetlights were not on yet, but the nights curtains were closing quickly around me.     \n\n\nI picked up in my pace, I could feel the cold of night nipping at my heels. I could hear a mixture of Mr. Holloway yelling and hitting his wife, along with my mom lecturing me about being home before the lights came on.       \n\n\nThat bleak orange tinge that brushed over the dark clouds was fading, failing to the twilight and the emerging of the crescent moon. Only to be smothered by blackened clouds that shrouded over head. \n\n\nAs I walked down the open road, I kept looking over my head for the streetlights to come on. Nothing. Even looking behind me in anticipation of the streaming headlights of a passing car, but the road was bare of anyone except me and my fear.     \n\n\nNow the road I was walking on was like a county road of sorts. Reese lives on the outskirts of our town, and I live about twenty minutes from him. To give an idea of the landscape. There are a ton of trees, nearby creeks that run rampant during the rain seasons, but were exceptionally shallow right now, so the water was still and silent. By all rights this walk should have been peaceful.    \n\n\nInstead, it was hollow and harrowing. My heightened anxiety from the previous events obviously served as a conduit of jittery reactions and panic to small, sublime things that on a regular day wouldn’t even catch my attention, but now, every move of a branch, every rodent mucking about in the brush had me jumping on edge.    \n\n\nEven in that moment I was rationalizing, trying to mentally usher myself into a calmer disposition, but instead my fear as served with a fresh injection of a perverse, creeping spine tingle when all the shrubbery and branches began twirling and undulating as if a powerful windstorm had just brisked through the county line.    \n\n\nHowever, there was no wind. The air was still, the temperature was that of a warm, even hot, summer night. Watching all the bushes and shrubbery made me power walk now, staring up at the streetlights, begging for those lights to flicker on and guide my feet back home.    \n\n\nIt was dark now. Night had fully smothered the sky. Only the waning light of a crescent moon, which had its twilight lamination become dampened, nearly choked out by the dark clouds.    \n\n\nStill, the streetlights failed to flare. Instead, those shallow creek beds just off the road began to splash, splash loudly behind me, then all around me. The hairs on the back of my neck rose, as if an icy hand of whatever lurked behind me, splashing about in the creek bed at night, was reaching out to throttle me.  \n\n\nMy power run became a full-on sprint. I looked behind me, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever was manifesting nature itself to defy its own rules and splay about, causing plants to move and water to crash.   \n\n\nNothing.    \n\n\nThere was nothing. I came to a skidding halt, nearly sliding backside against the pavement. I had to rationalize this. I needed a moment to think this through. There had to be a reason. Things like trees swaying and water splashing, they don’t just happen without a reason. I may have been young, but I had a love and appreciation for science, for logic and action and reaction.    \n\n\nMy search for the action was answered in the sound of a muffled, demented type of hoarse, guttural cry that sounded as if a person had made this cry, it likely tore their throat to ribbons, slicing the back of their voice box to a bloody mess. Yet it also sounded drowned out. As if someone was screaming abnormally loud through a pillow that had been taped to their face.    \n\n\nWell, every action has a reaction. And the cry now had a body that drunkenly swayed out from the creek bed, just off the road and shambled onto the road. Its bones cracked like the trees around us, still swaying about in the still air, assaulted by some unrelenting, unfelt presence.     \n\n\nThis thing was taller than me, perhaps about six feet tall. It looked up in the air, its body facing sideways to me, so I did not have a good look at the entirety of this shadowy, apparition. All I could see was it look up, gazing at the dead streetlights. Its arm cracking upright, fingers with some type of long extension, perhaps nails? Long, tangled nails began to tap, tap, tap, against the steel of the pole.    \n\n\nThen its sinewy, frail body shuddered as it now faced me, and I could get a frontal view of it. Long, frazzled hair that looked unkempt. Then a smell. A burnt, coppery, expired stench that was thick enough to taste in the back of your throat. It tilted its head at me, as if confused by my presence. It took a step closer, still at least a full block and a half away from me, and then I saw a chunk of its face sling down from its jawline to its shoulder, flailing back and forth.    \n\n\nThe image was grotesque. I stepped back, shocked, until I realised that it was not something from its jawline that hung about, it was its jaw, just torn off, hanging by a few fragments of what I could only presume to be bone and flesh.   \n\n\nI had no intention of finding out, so I ran as fast as I could, desperately crying out for help, calling for someone to come and save me.    \n\n\nTo my horror, I watched my own neighbours watch me run and flail my arms toward them, staring t them with watery eyes, begging for help, only to be responded with closed curtains and sad looks.   \n\n\nHow could they do this? How could the people I have known my whole life watch this happen to me?  \n\n\nI screamed insults and swore more than Reese’s garbage, drunkard of a father.   \n\n\nThat’s when I heard the loud, mechanical humming coming from behind me, along with that things, guttural howls. The streetlights began to power up and turn on. One by one I caught glances behind me at the lights chasing the thing that chased me.   \n\n\nNow the thing picked up its pace, gaining on me in horrifying fashion. The way it shambled and sort of crawl-ran at me on all fours, with its hanging jaw swaying about, I could see from the bursting light that gained on it that its jawline had teeth sewn into it. Which only made me want to puke more.  \n\n\nA large white truck whipped past me and then slammed on the brakes, turning till the drivers’ side door faced by backside. I stopped, rushing to the truck, hopping inside the back passenger door.    \n\n\nJust before the thing flung itself in air, charging the truck, the final streetlight came on, and it dissipated into nothingness.   \n\n\nThe man in the truck drove me home, calling himself Earl. He was a Lineman who had to come out and fix the start-up issues with the streetlights. He yammered on about old breaker systems in the town, seemingly unphased by the other worldly being that chased me and nearly smashed into his truck.   \n\n\nWhen he stopped at my place, my parents came rushing out, hugging, and holding onto me. Before I was brought inside for the longest lecture of my life, I asked Earl one more time, what had happened and why nobody helped me. He gave me an answer, albeit a vague one.       \n\n\n“I am a lineman son, and we have brought light to the roads across the world since we made homes from clay and wicker. We have seen a lot. We have kept this world bright to blind the things that grinds its knives in the dark. I won’t say much about the folk that watched you struggle, and I am sorry it happened. Just do as your mom and dad say and come home before the lights come on.”    \n\n\nI felt unsatisfied by his answer, and in truth, in disbelief. I grabbed his sweater as he tried to get back in his truck.   \n\n\n“So, what, you are trying to say that guys that work the lines keep us safe from, that thing?” I was dumbfounded, and in truth, I felt cheated by his answer.   \n\n\nAll he did was laugh and point to the insignia on his city truck. Which held a lightning bolt over a torch with the initials of our city and state. “Linemen were torch bearers and lamppost builders in the old times. If our job is so safe, then why did we carry swords?” he said with a smug smile before getting into his truck and driving off into the night.",

        "text": " When I was a kid, I spent a lot of time in the closet.\n\nIn more ways than one.\n\nI used to live in the same house as my grandparents. We had just moved to Washington from California and had yet to find a home we could afford. I had, and still have, insomnia. I often spent nights awake, watching the Backyardigans on my tiny Ipod. For some reason, probably because I was a weird hobbit of a child, I often spent my nights in the closet.\n\nI had made a small den of sorts in the back of the closet; A pillow and a soft barbie blanket I had stolen from the living room. I often snuck out into the office/guest room to steal my Ipod.\n\nOne night, as I snuck out to the office, I heard a sharp scratching noise.\n\nFor some context, my grandparents house was set up like a large T. The living room was a the front of the house, and as you walk to the kitchen and dining room, there is a long hallway that ended in my room. The office was the first door in the hallway.\n\nThere was a large glass door that lead to the backyard in the dining room. I had assumed that it was my grandparents dog, wanting to be let back inside. As I walked past the office and through the living room, I saw my dog sleeping on the couch. So it wasn't her scratching to be let in.\n\nI was always a skeptical child, so my mind never went to the boogey man. I just assumed it was a branch scratching at a window.\n\nI tip-toed like a cartoon burgler into the office. The Ipod was charging on the office desk. I grabbed the Ipod and shoved it into my pocket, cartoon burgler tip-toeing back down the hallway. Once I got into my room, I heard the same scratching noise.\n\nI looked up at the windows in my room. They were oddly shaped and I could only really see the sky and the tree in the front yard through it. I was a short kid, so I had to step on a luggage suitcase thing to be able to even see the street. And I did exactly that.\n\nI stood on my tip-toes and peered through the window to the street. The scratching didn't come from the tree. The tree was a birch tree with very short branches. The scratching came from another window on the other side of the house.\n\nA person wearing a dark gray/black snow parka was using a knife to try and pry open the small window that was at the top of the garage wall. I remember staring at the man trying to get the window open for so long that my tiny legs began to shake. After a while, the person seemed to have given up.\n\nMy interest had gone, so I stepped down from the suitcase, ready to get some Backyardigans in before sunrise. I remember looking down, watching my feet as I stepped off. I had fallen once before and was careful to not fall again.\n\nI looked up once my feet were safely planted on the floor.\n\nThe starry sky was blocked by a pale face.\n\nI froze.\n\nThe person was an older looking woman. She had a ghostly pale face, and long black hair. I vividly remember the eye bags under her eyes; they made her eyes look like they were bulging out of her head.\n\nWhen I get freaked out, my eyes water. I remember the woman mouthing something through the window. It was muffled, but I'm pretty sure she told me, \"Shhh, don't cry.\"\n\nThe scratching started again.\n\nShe was trying to get my window open.\n\nI dashed to my closet, crawling to my safe haven. The scratching seemed to echo in my head. I remember wiping my eyes again and again, trying to prevent tears from rolling down my face. The scratching seemed to go on for hours. I curled into a ball, surrounded by my grandfathers shoes and my Barbie blanket.\n\nI must have fallen asleep.\n\nI woke up to my family frantically yelling for me and trying to find where I had gone. I quietly got out of my closet and saw my mother in the living room. She turned and saw me, running to me and hugging my tightly. I didn't hug her back.\n\nI was distracted by the large crack in the corner of my window.",

        "text": "Hitman, murderer, assassin, whatever you want to call it. I don't really care, but paid killer just sounds nice to me I guess.\n\nHonestly, I actually never tried to take multiple targets for a contract. Normally it's a terrible idea, considering there is of course multiple people. Usually only received one target anyway, originally I was planning on declining, but when I got an absurd amount of money, I decided to take this.\n\nMy client even sent me a file of extensive research for each family member. There was Cody, Allison, Leonard, and Kelly, two parents, two children. Only issue is that there were no photos of any of the targets. Which was a slight problem considering I'd have no clue what they looked like. But I got enough information on them, such as location plus routines, also going to mention it, but money is money.\n\nI immediately got to work on a planned date, 11:59 PM, December 31st. The family will be all gathered together for the New Years, it's perfect.\n\nThe time had come already. I had the perfect spot, the perfect weapon for the deed, and the perfect shot for each family.\n\nBefore hand I did make notes for the furniture if any of them try to hide. It seemed flimsy from my previous observations. A bullet from my rifle could easily penetrate it.\n\nI layed on a hill, in a snow covered ghillie suit and some basic camouflage on my rifle, suppressor included. I checked my watch, 11:58. I scoped in and aimed for the father.\n\nUnexpectedly, he stared back, right at me. I looked confused, shocked.\n\nIt was my client, did he actually just pay me to kill him and his entire family? Then every single member of that household stared at me.\n\nDid they spot me, was it a glint from my scope? No matter, it was 12:59, I held my breath, and took the shot. I cocked my rifle as I exhaled and got ready to aim for the mother. My eyes widened. The father was still standing, a clear shot through the head, no blood even came out from his wound.\n\nI was quick get up and swing my rifle over my shoulder to get out of there. That family is not human, and I got paid to do the impossible. I got into my truck and started the ignition. \n\nWhen I slammed on the gas pedal to leave the vicinity, I didn't get far. My tires were slashed, definitely.\n\nSo this is karma. I couldn't keep my composure and I definitely started freaking out a little, my heart was racing.\n\nGetting out of my truck was the best idea, either way I was going nowhere with my tires destroyed, so I ran. I couldn't run near the streets, but there was a forest where I constructed a hideout shack a place to lay low, that was my Plan B if something went wrong.\n\nAlthough by wrong I meant the cops or a neighbor sighting me, not this.\n\nSo I ran to the general direction of the forest. I reached into the pockets I made myself and grabbed my compass. Directly North East, and that's where I went.\n\nLuckily I did make it to the shack. However I only have one bar of connection, and I'm definitely certain that family could be hunting me.\n\nMy rifle is close to me, bullets didn't harm them, but maybe if I used it blunt it could work.\n\nDo I regret my decisions in life for my choices?\n\nNo, I don't. There aren't any regrets I have, none.\n\nBut I'm definitely scared right now, if that family found me, I wouldn't stand any chance. I'm basically just screwed, really screwed.\n\nIf I ration my supplies properly, I'd say I have a week to survive. As in advance I did prepare food for this shack, since I usually lay low for a while.\n\nStill though, this whole thing kind of scares me. What is that family, how didn't the father die, why did my client pay for me to kill him and his wife and kids, and if they aren't human, what are they?\n\nI have a bad feeling, something is definitely close.",

        "text": "I’m sure you’ll think I’m a coward when you read this. But, I just couldn’t make myself fight.\n\n\nI was conscripted into the Ukrainian army to fight against Russia. I agree, it is an existential struggle for our nation. It’s important.\n\n\nBut to be frank, I’m terrible at getting along with others. That is, people. I’m always misreading situations, saying the wrong things, taking people too literally, not reading intentions, not understanding social conventions. I knew I couldn’t help in a military unit, and I would be a problem there.\n\n\nAt the same time, I couldn’t leave the country. I am of draft age and healthy, after all. And I won’t try to run or make family or others hide me. They shouldn’t face risk for my own faults.\n\n\nWhen you can’t flee, where do you go?\n\n\nAway. Anywhere away from the shots, the bomb shelters, the sirens, the crowds. I needed to go somewhere they wouldn’t look for me. Fortunately, I had an idea in mind.\n\n\nThe Chernobyl exclusion zone. Who, I thought, in their right mind, Ukrainian or Russian, would go there and stay? And eventual cancer means nothing to me when I could be shot tomorrow if I stayed. I already volunteered there, checking my exposures and making trips in and out.\n\n\nYou see, when the privileged residents of the atomic city, Pripyat, were evacuated, they were told it was only for a few days. So, they left their pets behind. The dogs, improbably, survived. Even thrived and bred. We call it, with black humor, “Puppy-yat.” The dogs are, largely, friendly though somewhat feral, and preternaturally intelligent. We have to change our uniforms each year because they recognize the clothes of people who come to catch and sterilize them. They’re survivors. They’re problem-solvers. Like those dogs in Moscow who learned to ride the subway to stay warm.\n\n\nI help feed them. Get the ones we can catch, sterilized to stop the cycle. Give basic medical care. Even send out the more vulnerable and friendlier ones for decontamination and adoption. So I’m one of a tiny handful of people allowed in the zone, and who knows it well.\n\n\nAgain, the risk of something eventual I can’t see, versus the risk of a Russian bullet, or my own people imprisoning me for my refusal to fight? I’ll take the radiation exposure.\n\n\nClick. Click. Clickclickclick. Screech. A hotspot, according to my handheld Geiger counter. Okay. Don’t settle there. My chest felt tight with anxiety as I slipped in and out through the fences with dog food, water, and medicine.\n\n\nThe last trip was with my father’s old military backpack. Fifty pounds. I grunted, not used to the weight. Something darted out of the darkness as soon as I slipped through the last layer, whining and rubbing against my legs.\n\n\n“Masha?” I whispered. An answering yelp, and I felt the familiar scar on her stomach in the dark. “There you are. Good girl. You’ll be so happy. I’ve come to live with all of you!” She licked my hand in response. Always was my favorite, like a pet of my own, even though I couldn’t adopt her. I didn’t want to separate her from her now-grown puppies, as she’d had a litter before I could get her spayed.\n\n\n\nI felt surges of terror and a manic, strange urge to laugh as I made my camp on the third floor of a dilapidated, but still standing, concrete apartment block with a good view in all directions. Here I was, having spent years following rules about contamination- we never even sat down on the ground in the zone if we could help it- and I was moving in!\n\n\nBut, time and life move on. I cared for the dogs and left food and water out at different spots around the zone. I had my sister and local contacts bringing in more food when we ran out. And none of us had grown a second head (yet) from being here.\n\n\nThen, one cold morning, I heard distant shouting in Russian. But, the zone is at least 30 kilometers square! To my knowledge, other than supply drops, there were no other humans within the zone. The dogs living with me barked and howled, their noses scenting invasion on the wind.\n\n\nI told you I’m a coward. I hid. And anyway, who would actually suspect a draft dodger in an irradiated wasteland? I avoided the trenches and the troops as I did my duties to the dogs. But, the supplies stopped coming. I hunted hare, fox, deer, fished, and generally tried to catch anything that moved, for my dogs and myself.\n\n\nBut we were all hungry. I can’t describe that kind of hunger to you, reading in safe luxury. It was terrible. It seemed never to end. I could keep myself alive by finding edible plants and mushrooms and stealing MREs, but my dogs were slowly dying.\n\n\n\nMasha showed them the way. She woke me up by growling out of the glass less window. There was one Russian soldier in the predawn light, perhaps smoking or taking a break. And Masha hadn’t eaten in three days.\n\n\nIt was brutal and awe-inspiring. She seemed to communicate with the other dispirited dogs surrounding my camp, just by looks and small gestures. I saw their wolf ancestors that day. Masha and two others attacked him, her powerful jaws biting through his arteries. They were hungry, yes, but I think they also somehow knew about this conflict. They never bit or attacked me, after all. He never even saw it coming, never fired a shot. They surrounded him, snuck up. It was over in ten seconds.\n\n\nThey dragged his body back between the three of them, dropped him in the stairwell. And then Masha, my favorite, with arterial spray still dripping off of her face, came to me, and nudged my arm. Then she led me to see what they had done.\n\n\n“Good girl. Very smart,” I whispered, not knowing if more soldiers were around. They helped me drag him to my makeshift home. You’re going to think what I did is horrible, but surely this man would have killed me if he saw me, and it was his fault I couldn’t get food for the dogs any more.\n\n\nI had a really tough survival knife. He was already dead. Meat is meat. I stripped him, took his jacket, weapons, and MREs, then hid the rest of his effects. And I carved him up like a pig. All the dogs in the zone ate that night.\n\n\nThis has been happening every few days for months now. The dogs eat nothing else. I know all the dogs in the zone. Who’s friendly, who’s aggressive, where they fit in a pack, what they like.\n\n\nWhen the attacks here in the north eased up and Russia started seeing sense, they pulled their troops. Whoever thought digging trenches in radioactive dirt was a good idea? And I was able to get supplies again. To see my sister.\n\n\nBut, I decided I’m done hiding. It’s time to do my part for Ukraine. Dogs, too, are casualties of this war. And here I am, sitting among dogs that will literally eat the invaders. I think they prefer it to dog food.\n\n\nI told you I wouldn’t fit into a conventional military unit. But I’ll find a way to give my country all I can. I made a deal with our military. Amnesty and decent wages, for my dogs of war. Tomorrow, my sister will take over feeding and caring for those left in the zone. And I’m shipping out to the front with a dozen of my most bloodthirsty. They attack in the dark. They surround prey. They strike lightning-fast.",

        "text": "Before you go and get mad at me for going out a long distance into the woods to see something I shouldn't have, I live in an off-grid home close to a national forest. Or I used to, anyway. I had to go about 80 kilometers to one of the cities in my area so that I could type this out, before I go and do what I need to do to beg for forgiveness.\n\nAnd there's a small town that's on-grid about 24 kilometers away, that which I went to most of the time for seeds to grow my own food, as well as use the smart phone I own to check in on my daughter's family.\n\nBut today, I screwed up bad. And the spirits know I frequent that small town, as some of them show up in that town often. So I had to drive and use public transportation to get to the big city to do this.\n\nBut I need to tell you what happened. What I saw that I should not have.\n\nIt's not just when the sun shines during rain that the fox spirits I heard about hold their weddings. There have been days when the sun shined while snow came down. And today, that's what the weather was like.\n\nI know the fox spirits don't like to be watched when they hold their weddings, but it usually means good luck when a sun shower happens.\n\nI ventured into the woods to get more wood for the fireplace. The trees that I raised for the wood died in their sapling stage, so I'm stuck with getting wild wood until I can successfully grow a tree garden for wood. It was while I was going to the forest that I began hearing some flute music.\n\nThe flute music was... music to my ears. Although accompanied by some bells and whistles, I also heard some drumming. I felt like I had to continue.\n\nIt seemed fascinating to an old man like me. I wondered just who could be playing such beautiful music in the forest.\n\nThen I remembered--there was sunshine and snowfall at the same time.\n\nI thought that maybe hiding behind a tree would help me not get caught while watching what event this might have been. But from my right, I began seeing shadows of some type. They seemed to be moving in a uniform manner, slow and steady.\n\nThey would move in this manner, then they would stop for a few minutes. Then, they would resume their march in this manner.\n\nI began sweating and my heart began to pound. They stopped their march in this way, and as they did, they all turned their heads in *my* direction! I began to worry about what they would do to me if I were caught.\n\nBut when they turned their heads in my direction for the 5th time since they appeared before me, I got a clear view of their faces and clothes.\n\nEach of what appeared to be the bridesmaids and groomsmen were wearing kimono, in red and black. The two that I guessed were the bride and groom were wearing kimono that really stood out. I assumed the bride was the one in the white kimono, and that the groom was wearing a blue kimono.\n\nAnd their faces... They looked strange. Menacing. Almost... demon-like. And the faces were black!\n\nI began to feel my heart pound faster than ever. I was sweating a bit profusely. So profusely I thought my head was gonna turn to ice in this weather.\n\nThen the things that I assumed were spirits went on with their matrimonial march. And then they turned their heads in my direction again.\n\nSure that I was caught watching them, I began to run. The forest seemed to stretch out in front of me while I was running back from the woods to my cabin, but I summed that up to vertigo even though I normally don't get vertigo.\n\nThe menacing faces kept coming into my vision. It was as if I couldn't run through the woods without seeing the faces.\n\nI finally reached the cabin after about 30 minutes of running. I thought for sure I'd be safe inside, but as soon as I reached the door, I noticed something through the window that looked like someone rummaging through the house and my belongings.\n\nSure enough, it was one of the creatures. It looked exactly like one of the ones I saw in the matrimony.\n\nIt seemed to be angry. And it appeared as though it were looking for something. Or someone...\n\nI darted off and jumped into a bush and waited until it came out of the cabin. When it did, it appeared to be looking around, then it darted off somewhere.\n\nIt dawned on me that it was going in the direction of the small town I go to sometimes that is on-grid!\n\nI went inside the cabin, hoping that I would be safe inside. I was about to rearrange the cabin to my liking when I noticed a small box on the table, with a note tied to it.\n\nI'll translate for you, since it was written in Japanese.\n\n\"You have seen us, and you have disturbed the wedding of Kuni and Tsubishi. You have broken the sacred law, that we are not to be seen during our sacred events. To gain our forgiveness, you must slit one wrist with the knife inside. Let the blood spill, for blood represents the truth of the soul. Do it near the site where you broke the law.\"\n\nI opened the box that was on the table, and sure enough, there was a knife inside. It looked something like a ritual dagger that I have seen hyper religious folks use, especially when part of a cult.\n\nTaking the box with me, I drove down the road to the small town. The air began to feel heavier and heavier the further I drove. Fear kept setting in while I was driving.\n\nBy the time I reached the small town, something felt terribly wrong. I was opting on using my smart phone to write this out, but one of the people in town put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Yamamoto-san, you shouldn't be here.\"\n\nI froze in place. The voice belonged to the owner of the flower shop. Someone who I once saw to get flowers for my wife's grave last year.\n\n\"Hey, Sadao, what's wrong?\" said one of the children.\n\n\"Sadao-kun, an angry bull spirit came looking for you.\" the florist remarked. \"You saw something you shouldn't have. He said to tell you to check back at your cabin if we saw you.\"\n\nI showed her the box and the note.\n\n\"So you picked up what he left there already? Good. I suggest you leave now while you still have time. You can't be here any longer. The bull spirits won't forgive you unless you show them you are sorry for disturbing their wedding.\"\n\nAfter that, I took a bus at the stop on the edge of the town. I was only going to use this public transportation to get to somewhere that I could write this. I'm writing this in an Internet café while I sip my last bit of coffee. After I post this, I will head back to the forest where I saw the matrimony, and I will follow the instructions on the note. It's the only way to get the bull demons to see I am sorry for disturbing the wedding, after all.\n\nI might die doing this, so it's best if I leave this message before I go ahead with it. I have no regrets, but the fact that I have to slit my wrist to apologize to the bull spirits scares me still.",

The opposite bank features a small cliff with thick trees at the top. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\n(suddenly serious)\n\nWe’re going to be working in the Ferrum River today, there was another drowning report and we’re still looking for that kid from last week.

Sorry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN sighs, then starts getting equipment out of the back of the truck and distributing it between them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\n(quickly and brusquely)\n\nThe most important thing is that we never go in the water. I don’t care what you think you see, you stay on the banks. We do this at night because during the day, the current pushes everything under the water, where we can’t see. Keep hold of your flashlight, and stay close. Got it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE fiddles idly with her necklace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nYep. Sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN points at the necklace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nAnd take that off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nUm. Do I have to? I’ve always worn it. Like a good luck charm?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nUnless you want it to catch on something and choke you to death, yeah, you need to take it off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN gives JUNE a quick smile and strides off towards the water. JUNE throws her necklace on the seat inside the truck, then goes to follow him. There are several shrines with flowers and crosses visible on the bank. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nAustin? What are those flowers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN looks back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nThose are shrines. For all the people who have died here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nOh. I didn’t realize it was so deadly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nThat’s why we don’t go in the water. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN walks away, but JUNE hesitates. She looks across the river, to the opposite bank, where CORA is visible, shadowed by the darkness. CORA raises a finger to her lips in a shushing motion, then disappears back into the trees. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINT. IN THE SHOWER—NIGHT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE is alone in her shower, washing her hair. The news is playing in the background. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRADIO (O.S.)\n\nCora Jones, a young girl from Ruchest county has now been missing for two weeks. She was last seen near the deadly Ferrum River, wearing a red dress. Her family is looking for any information. And now, our classical music hour. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe radio switches to slow classical music. As she continues to shower, the sound of the water gets louder and louder, drowning out the music. JUNE looks down and sees brackish seawater coming out of the drain around her ankles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nWhat…?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE turns towards the shower door, but it’s gone—she is hemmed in on all sides by tile walls. The sound of falling water thunders around her as the dirty water at her feet rises around her. She splutters and fights against the water, but soon her head goes under, there is silence. We see her underwater, trying sluggishly to swim. Just as it seems that she’s about to drown, she bursts above the surface of the water. JUNE is seemingly in the middle of the ocean, with no land in sight. She spends several moments coughing and trying to stay afloat, before she is pulled under the water again and everything goes black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT. IN THE SHOWER—DAY\n\nJUNE wakes up, lying on the shower floor, with no immediately visible sign that anything has happened. A phone is ringing in another room. JUNE stumbles to her feet, wraps a towel around herself, and goes to answer the phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\n(tiredly)\n\nYeah?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN (O.S)\n\n(angrily)\n\nWhy the hell aren’t you here? You’re two hours late, I’ve already called you twice. I was this close to coming to your house to make sure you hadn’t been murdered in your bed! I expect at least two more weeks before you die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE leans against the wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nI’m…not murdered. Sorry, I guess I overslept. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nJust get here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE winces and steps forward, off the wall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nWait, uh, where am I supposed to go again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nI told you that yesterday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nYeah. It’s been a long night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE closes her eyes and rests her forehead on the wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\n(annoyed)\n\nWe’re at Ferrum River again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nThanks—\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN hangs up before JUNE can finish. JUNE sighs and combs her fingers through her hair. She looks confused and pulls her hand back in front of her. She is holding a piece of seaweed that had been stuck in her hair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEXT. ON THE BANK OF FERRUM RIVER—DAY\n\nJUNE is walking through the forest alongside the river bank, on her way to meet up with Austin. She is wearing her necklace. CORA steps in front of her, out of the shadows in the trees, and JUNE, walking quickly with her head down, runs into CORA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nWoah! Uh, sorry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA puts her hands on her hips and tilts her head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA\n\nAre you the new zombie woman?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE laughs nervously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nI’m pretty sure I’ve never been a zombie before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA\n\n(sulkily)\n\nNo, silly! Of course you aren’t a zombie. You just find them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nOh, well, I look for the corpses of people who died in the water. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE pauses momentarily and takes in CORA’S very young appearance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE (CONT’D)\n\nShit, you’re like ten. Um, I mean, I try to take care of people who fall asleep. In the water. And forget to get out. Yeah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE shakes her head and looks hard at CORA. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE (CONT’D)\n\nI’m sorry, who are you? Shouldn’t you be in school?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA\n\n(brightly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, I’m Cora! And I don’t like school, so I don’t go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA frowns. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA (CONT’D)\n\nAnd shit is a bad word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE tries to edge past CORA on the riverbank, but CORA moves to block her way. Trees and underbrush rustle in the background, and move gently, like there are hundreds of things moving slowly through them, but nothing is visible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nThat’s great. I really need to get going, though, so could you move please?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE makes a shooing motion at CORA’S face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA\n\n(pouting)\n\nBut I really want to get to know you better, June. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE frowns, disturbed. There is movement behind her again, closer this time, and bigger. There are things that might be faces visible in the shadows of the nearest trees. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nHow do you know my name? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA shrugs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA\n\nYou went in the river. I went in the river too, you know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDozens of people step out of the forest silently, out of June’s eyesight. She doesn’t see them. Some look normal, but the vast majority are desiccated and skeletal, bloated by water. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nThat’s cool. Maybe don’t, though, in the future. It can get pretty dangerous. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA smiles widely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA\n\nOh, I know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE, seeing movement out of the corner of eye, spins around and sees the ranks of the dead around her. She gasps and stumbles backwards. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA(CONT’D)\n\nWe’re all very well aware of that, actually. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE turns towards the river, where there seems to be a space clear of bodies, but more people start crawling out of the river, crowding her in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\n(panicky)\n\nWhat—nope, no. Fuck this. What the fuck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE runs. CORA screams and darts forwards, unnaturally fast, and grasps the necklace that JUNE is wearing. She twists it in her grasp, cutting off JUNE’S air. JUNE trips, then chokes on the ground, grappling at CORA’S hand and trying to push it away. The other people surround JUNE, leering down at her. Then, from down the path, comes AUSTIN’S voice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nJune? Are you here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORA scowls and releases the necklace. When JUNE looks up again, CORA and the rest of the dead are gone, leaving her hyperventilating on the ground. AUSTIN rounds the corner, seeing JUNE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nWhat the hell—are you okay? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN rushes forward and crouches by JUNE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\n(shakily)\n\nThere was a girl. And, and. I don’t even know. I don’t even know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAustin touches the mark on JUNE’S neck, from her being choked with the necklace, drawing away when JUNE flinches. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\n(quietly)\n\nTell me what happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nThere was a girl. At least, I think she was a girl. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nCalm down June, you’re okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN sits beside her, guiding her to lean against his shoulder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nWe’ll figure it out. Here, want a piece of jerky?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN fishes a piece of jerky out of his pocket and holds it in front of JUNE’S nose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nWhere did you even…? No, I’m good, thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nYour loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\nSure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN gets to his feet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nI’m going to call my boss and let her know that you were attacked and ask what we should do. I’m just going to be over by the truck, don’t go anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN steps away, towards the truck but still in eyeshot, and takes out his phone. JUNE lays on the ground for a moment, arm covering her eyes, then stands up. She looks around and her eyes catch on something moving in the water. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE\n\n(scared)\n\nAustin? Do you see that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN continues talking on the phone, obviously not having heard her. JUNE looks closer, and steps towards the banks. The light shifts, and a small form with bedraggled hair and a muddy dress are suddenly visible in the water. \n\nJUNE\n\nAustin! I think there’s someone in the river!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN still doesn’t hear. The person in the water is struggling, clawing at the air, obviously drowning. JUNE looks around, then yells to Austin. \n\nJUNE\n\nI’m going in the river! There’s a kid in there! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN finally turns around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAUSTIN\n\nJune, Wait!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJUNE doesn’t wait. She just runs for the river. As she hits the water, ghostly figures appear, lining the banks. They watch her silently. JUNE swims towards the struggling girl, the water pushing her around. She hits a rock, spinning around hard. She gasps for air, things spinning faster and faster, leaving her disoriented and the air spinning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEXT. FERRUM RIVER\n\nAUSTIN stands near a shrine on the river bank, a colorful thing with dozens of flowers and a simple cross. He has a bouquet of flowers in her arms. He puts it down, then walks away slowly. We move closer, and see the name engraved on the cross— it says *June*. As AUSTIN turns away, a girl in a red dress crawls slowly out of the river, with JUNE right behind her. \n\nEND\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I think it must have been one of my relatives who wrote this. Ferrum River is the river near my house; it's got a bit of a reputation for haunting and misfortune, so we all steer well clear of it. Strangely, my great-aunt was named June. June died when she was twenty-five. She drowned in the river. I don't know why anyone would have written something about her as horrible as this, but I guess that people do weird things because of grief. I* did *go down to the river yesterday, though, and there* is *a shrine there to June, so this must have at least some truth to it. Reading this must have disturbed me more than I thought, though, because when I was in the shower this morning, there was a second where I thought the water went murky. There was dirt and seaweed caked over all the walls and I couldn't breathe. Of course, a second later the feeling was gone and the shower was completely clean. I know that I just made it up, but still, I don't think I'm going back to Ferrum River any time soon.*",

        "text": "[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ztlvlq/pray_you_never_draw_the_ace/)\n\nIt had been 38 days since I knocked on the limo’s window. \n\nI was more than a month clean, living by the beach in San Diego when I got fired. Money was missing from the till at work, and I was an easy target. Who knows, maybe I’d put in a couple of receipts wrong.\n\nI went out that night meaning to down a couple of beers and blow off some steam, maybe find someone to go home with. Instead, I found myself seven or eight drinks in, walking the streets at midnight looking to score. \n\nAs I took a corner, I saw the limo coming the opposite direction. It pulled up beside me and the window rolled down. The skeletal old man peered out at me. My whole body tensed, total fight or flight mode. His eyes felt like two guns pointed straight at me.\n\n“Here to play?” he asked, and I thought of the nearly $8k I still had stashed back at my place.\n\n“Fuck off,” I told him, trying not to let my voice shake, and he chuckled. “You follow me here or something?” I added, trying to sound brave. “Go back to Philly.”\n\n“Oh, I get around,” he said.\n\nBehind him, his hulking companion peered out, staring right through me.\n\n“Go find another mark,” I told them.\n\n“When you’re ready, then,” the old man said. Then he opened the door and a body fell out. A woman, maybe 45, except it was hard to tell from all of the scratch marks on her face. She was missing an arm, but she wasn’t bleeding. She’d already been fully drained.\n\nThe old man motioned to his driver to keep going, and the limo disappeared into the distance. I took one last look at the woman and then got the fuck out of there.\n\nA few blocks later, I found a guy selling. I’d gone in meaning to spend fifty bucks max, but I ended up emptying my full wallet, three bills worth.\n\nBy the end of the month, I’d nearly gone through my whole bankroll. I spent my days on the couch watching House Hunters. I imagined a life where I had three good options and my biggest problem was a nice girl who wrinkled her nose at my choice of countertops. \n\nMy roommate, Ellie, totally bought every lie I told. She brought me back big bowls of soup from her job at PF Changs and asked if I needed to see a doctor. She made me take my phone when I took my walks at night and texted me every once in a while to make sure I was all good. \n\nSometimes on those nights, when it got late enough, I’d call my east coast friends, who were just waking up. My mom offered to fly out. My sister too. I told them I was doing great, that I’d gotten promoted, and even lost some weight. \n\nI told them I was learning to surf, and they should see my tan. Maybe they believed me. Maybe they just wanted to. They never did come to visit.\n\nWhen the money ran out, I lasted as long as I could before I started looking for the limo again. Totally tapped out, I didn’t even have the cash for a sixer at 7-11. I made it maybe 18 hours before I felt like my skeleton was going to jump out of my skin.\n\nI found the limo by the beach. It was parked, and the old man had the window down. He watched the black sea.\n\n“There you are,” he said. “I trust you remember the rules?”\n\nI nodded. I was shaking now, a little withdrawal, a little from anticipation. I knew I’d fucked up. I’d had everything I needed to get out, and instead I’d pissed it all away. And in my deepest heart, I knew I deserve to draw a king, even an ace.\n\nThe man took the deck of cards from his pocket and handed it over. My hands, palsied from the withdrawal, were shaking bad enough that I had to kneel on the beach and shuffle against the sand.\n\n“What a mess. What a mess,” said the old man as I handed him back the deck, a little worse for wear. “Please, go ahead and draw.”\n\nI closed my eyes and reached forward, taking the top card. Then I turned it over, fully expecting to see a king. Instead, I saw the joker.\n\nI looked up at the old man, my eyes searching for some kind of answer.\n\n“I thought you took those out or something,” I said.\n\nHe shrugged and smiled. “Not always,” he said. “You said you knew the rules.”\n\n“I thought I did.”\n\nWe both looked down at the card. For a moment, everything was silent except for the sound of the crashing waves.\n\n“What happens now?” I asked.\n\n“You hand me your phone and get in the car,” he said. “And then we wait to see who texts you first.”\n\nI sat in the car in silence for a few minutes. All the while, the old man quietly shuffled his deck, occasionally glancing at my phone. His hulking companion stared off into the distance, as if looking past the faint stars hovering above the sea.\n\nI thought about all of the stories I’d heard about guys who drew aces. I wonder if he was the one who carried them out, or was there some worse stranger hiding back at their house, salivating at the thought of a fresh junkie to work on.\n\n“At this juncture, I like to play a guessing game,” said the old man. “Who will it be? Your last several messages are all from women. ‘Mom,’ ‘Ellie,’ ‘Bethany,’ ‘Random club girl.’ I guess you never got her name. But no worries, if she’s the one who texts, we have ways of tracking her down.”\n\n“Let me draw again,” I begged. “Fuck, I’ll take a king or ace shot.”\n\nBut the old man shook his head.\n\n“This is much more fun, I’m afraid. And I’m as much a slave to the cards as you are. No, the rules are the rules. Whoever texts you next must pull a card of their own and live with the consequences. This is your doing of course. The deck and I are only instruments of your will.”\n\n“Bullshit,” I said. “This is on you.”\n\nHe laughed, and the phone beeped.\n\n“Ellie!” he shouted. “I was so hoping it would be her. He motioned to his driver as he started to text Ellie back.\n\n*Ellie! Could really use your help. I’ll be outside in a minute, riding in a limo with some friends. Kind of random, but would you mind just talking to my friend for a minute? It would help me out of a rough spot. Thanks! You’re the best!*\n\nThe car pulled off the beach and headed toward home.\n\n“Please,” I said. “Please don’t do this.”\n\n“Hush,” said the old man. “It’ll all be over soon. Don’t worry so much.”\n\nEllie was waiting when we reached the curb in front of our apartment. She was in her pajamas and an oversized sweatshirt, crossing her arms in the cold sea breeze.\n\n“Hey!” she said, smiling wide, when the old man rolled the window down. “I definitely can’t wait to hear the story behind this one!”\n\n“In a minute,” said the old man. “First, I’ll need you to do your friend here a little favor. You see, we’re playing a game, and he’s selected you to draw a card. You may shuffle if you wish.”\n\n“Don’t I get to know the rules?” she asked.\n\n“Sorry,” said the old man. “But no. You see, he’s the one playing the game.”\n\nShe took the cards in hand.\n\n“Why are they sandy?” she asked.\n\n“Never mind that,” said the old man. “Just choose.”\n\n“Don’t–” I started, but the hulk poked the gun into my ribs. I knew that things would only be worse for both me and Ellie if I said another word.\n\nEllie cut the deck a few times and then plucked a card from the top.\n\n“Dun dun dun dun!” she sang as she held it out. I imagined her dropping dead, a bullet straight to the center of her forehead, the way her blood would flow down the gutter and out into the ocean.\n\nI held my breath. The old man was right. Everything that was about to happen was all on me. \n\nThen Ellie turned the card over to reveal a five of spades.\n\n“Very good,” said the old man, not even disappointed. He reached into his coat and took out an envelope full of hundreds. Then he counted out five right into Ellie’s hand. \n\n“Are you freaking serious?” she asked, smiling wide. “This is my kind of game!”\n\n“Perhaps we’ll play again sometime,” said the old man, opening the door. I stumbled out of the car. Then the old man shut the door and gave a little wave goodbye. “Until next time.”\n\nFor a minute, Ellie just kind of stared at me, and then down at the money in her hand.\n\n“So, that’s where you go at night?” she asked. “To see him?”\n\n“And other friends,” I said. “People you don’t want to meet.”\n\n“Well, I thought it was fun,” she said, smirking, completely oblivious to the fate she’d so narrowly dodged.\n\nI was still coasting off residual adrenaline, but the fear was starting to dissipate, replaced by that old hunger.\n\n“Look,” I said, itching at my arm. “That money. At least half of it belongs to me.”\n\n“No way,” she said. “He gave it to me. That was the game, right?”\n\n“I’m serious,” I said. “You might not understand this, but I need it. Like, right now. I’m not joking.”\n\nFor a second, she thought about it. \n\n“Then take me with you,” she said. “Let me be part of it. These nighttime adventures of yours.”\n\n“No,” but even as I said it, I knew I wasn’t strong enough to keep saying it.\n\n“Then I’m going back inside with the cash.”\n\nShe turned away, and I could tell she was serious.\n\n“Please,” I said. “Don’t make me do this.”\n\nShe took a step toward home.\n\n“Your loss,” she said. “We could have had a pretty awesome night…”\n\n“Fine,” I shouted. \n\nAnd I realized the game wasn’t over yet. We were still playing. And it was rigged. No matter what card she would have drawn, the end result was always going to be the same.\n\nThen I took her hand, and she followed me into the [night](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101vkdd/ghostwhispersio_final/",
        "text": "Curious now, I clicked on it and read the article. Apparently, one of the tracks that was playing that night was done so without the artist's knowledge and they found out because, following the incident, the police investigation revealed that the track the guy was listening to, the designated song for his color group, was from that particular artist. You probably see where this's going, but I'll tell you that it honestly shocked me the first time I saw it. The artist was \"[Ghostwhispers.io](https://Ghostwhispers.io)\". More specifically, \"Rolfe E. Cau\", the apparent mind behind the madness.\n\nRolfe was quoted in saying that his music was \"More than an art, but a gift to the elder ones\" and explained that, because of that, he required a high price for any individual or media platform to download, use, or even listen to his music. \"A sign of tribute to the ones below\" as he put it. A bit overcompensating, I know, but art is art, I guess, to each their own. The point was that the club had been playing his music, despite him refusing to allow it after failing to agree to his lofty price arrangement.\n\nThis compelled me to want to look further into Rolfe E. Cau and see exactly what \"[Ghostwhispers.io](https://Ghostwhispers.io)\" was actually about. After spending about 30 minutes trying to find *anything* about it, other than the lawsuit and the incident at the club, I finally settled on an old Facebook page from Rolfe himself. Judging from the fact that the last post that'd been made by the account was from all the way back in '09, I knew that any information I'd find here would be outdated at best. Still, I was able to sift through and learn that Rolfe E. Cau, to no real surprise, used to be an active satanist and ran an old group on there known as \"The whispering ghosts from below\".\n\nNow, I'm in no way religious. I don't have anything against those that are, your beliefs are your own, but I'll say right now that the shit I read on the old posts from this guy and a few of the others in his little niche was nothing short of fucking bizarre. I can't really explain much of it, but basically, these wingnuts believed in preaching about the coming of what they called \"The Elder Spirit\". None of them could give any consistent details on what \"The Elder One\" was or what they did.\n\nSome gave more or less a weird spin on the story of Genesis, where others tried putting elements from Lovecraft books to create this pseudo fan fiction for it. Rolfe E. Cau himself, however, oddly enough, didn't seem to take part in this. In fact, *his* philosophy was that only by speaking with the \"Elder One\" themselves could you even begin to understand what they are and/or what and why they do. If you're wondering just *how* to do that, there's actually a list he put together on how to somehow pull this off, but you're insane if you think I'm gonna list it here. Suffice to say, it's a long, and EXTREMELY dangerous process.\n\nSomewhere along the way, though, there was a sort of disconnect, some sort of point in time where the \"Whispering Ghosts\" drifted apart from another, with less and less posts being made and less and less chat among the members. From what I could see, there wasn't any sort of falling out between any of them or Rolfe himself, but rather just a growing apathy between them all. That is, except for Rolfe who, up until the last post made in late 2011, kept up the most, and pretty much only activity throughout the group. For the most part, the posts contained mostly just drawings and/or descriptions or \"portents\" as he called them -- real wack-job this one, cannot stress this enough -- about \"The Elder One's rising\".\n\nThe drawings were, at least the best I could make of it, of something similar to those freakish \"Biblically accurate angels\", being a giant mass of assorted eyeballs surrounded by a generated aura of some sort of energy or something. Some showed something similar to this, but instead of just a ball of eyes, the \"Elder One\" had the body of a person with the eyes embedded all across its body with the exception of its face which was blank. The dreams were more or less the same psychotic shit you'd expect a burgeoning cult leader to ramble on about, being all \"I have just dreamed of the almighty \"Elder One's\" awakening to hail the apocalypse\" and shit.\n\nIt was in mid 2010, when the group had really lost traction, that Rolfe started talking about making music. It started with small posts, similar to the ones about his \"Portents\", where he'd describe how he'd \"Hear and transcribe the prophecies of the \"Elder One\". Then he'd start leaving audio tracks in his posts. Finally, come the end of the year, he'd start downloading the tracks to SoundCloud and start posting links to there.\n\nThis continued right up until the last post made at the end of 2011 like I mentioned earlier. While at first, it seemed like there was potential for Rolfe to re-ignite interest in the group with his music, with members engaging in the posts, commenting on the tracks themselves, it didn't last terribly long. The last post was Rolfe, saying, \"The \"Elder One\" has chosen me as his prophet, and I have spoken. You have all closed your ears and your hearts to him. Do as you all will, but with or without disciples of my own, I will continue his good work.\"\n\nI tried to click on the SoundCloud links, only to find the account and the tracks were no longer there. No surprise, I guess, considering the lawsuit, but that got me wondering then, just how in the hell did the club owner have the track playing to begin with if he didn't pay for it? In that same vein, how did Jenna even hear about it? The solution: ask the club owner himself.\n\nThat day, I went through my routine check-up with no further incidents. At least, none as extreme as that. The next few days progressed like this, with the only weird thing to occur being the occassional nightmare here and there or the odd auditory hallucination sometimes when I'd walk down the halls to the bathroom or lie in bed. I still can't say whether or not it was necessarily a good thing that I'd become so desensitized to it by that point that it meant next to nothing for me to repeatedly hear *\"Hominum Flebit\"* in my ear by about a hundred different people -- in the floor *just below* the wack-o lodge -- but nevertheless, I didn't make any sort of scene with it.\n\nI still had control over my body and my senses. I guess that was enough for me. Either that, or my mind has a twisted sense of humor all its own.\n\nAnyway, it was enough of a charade to swindle the doctors and nurses to deem me safe to go back home without hurting myself or anyone else just a few days following. I called Jenna that afternoon to come pick me up and she was there a few minutes past noon. \"Hey, listen, I'm sorry I haven't called.\" she said immediately after I got in the car.\n\n\"It's okay.\" I replied. \"I have a favor to ask you though.\" She raised her eyebrows. \"Can you drive us by the club?\"\n\nShe chuckled, \"Wow, five days in the hospital and the first thing you think about wanting to do is dancing?\" She threw her head back laughing. I just stared at her. \"Oh... Oh shit, you're serious.\" Her eyes passed rapidly back and forth between the car clock and me. \"Hell, Kitty Kat, I don't even think the place is open. What're you even wanting to go there for, especially when it's only noon?\"\n\nI opened my mouth, then stopped. To be honest, up to that point, I hadn't really thought of what to say. I just kind of thought she'd go along with it, even if she had a point and the place probably *wasn't* open and wouldn't likely be until around 10 that night at the earliest. I wasn't sure what to tell her about the \"[Ghostwhispers.io](https://Ghostwhispers.io)\" stuff I'd found online. At the same time, I needed to talk to the club owner, see what he knew and/or how the hell he even got the track to begin with.\n\nIn the end, I went with pulling out my phone and showing her the article about the lawsuit. Her first reaction was confusion, then shock, then something of interest (giving the phone the same look she sometimes gave me when we'd get drunk together late at night...). \"Ooh... I see, you're trying to learn more about the band, huh?\" She winked and added, \"Atta girl.\"\n\n\"It's more than that, Jen.\" I opened the Facebook links. \"This dude was nuts and I want to know how and why they got the track illegally.\" She raised an eyebrow and gave me a patronizing smile.\n\n\"God, I told you you watch too many crime shows.\" I sighed and stared pleadingly. \"Oh come on, not the puppy eyes, you *know* I can't resist that.\" Somewhat amused, somewhat relieved she was caving, I made my eyes cartoonishly bigger and more pathetic looking. \"Oh, alright.\" she said finally, throwing the car in gear and driving out of the hospital parking lot.\n\nWe arrived at the club about five or six minutes later. Admittedly, Jenna might've had a point with the club probably not even bring open because the parking lot was the most deserted that I'd ever seen. We got out and went to the door, knocking as usual. Fortunately, Jenna always remembered the club's secret knock because I never could. It was a certain rhythm that was taught to all the paid members like Jenna and I. Sort of like a gang sign, if you will, that lets them know that you're a member.\n\nFor almost three minutes, the two of us just stood there like a couple of the idiots we'd always hear about who *didn't* know the secret knock and were left standing all alone outside -- shit she and I used to make jokes about. Jenna turned to me, giving me a sarcastic look that said \"I told you, dum-dum\" without telling me. I was actually about to try *my* hand at the knocking when I heard the bolt on the door slide back. We took a step back and the door soon opened.\n\nTanner, the door guy, stood in the doorway, eyeing us wondering why the hell *we'd* be here so early. \"Hey, the owner here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, but he's a bit tied up at the moment, why?\"\n\n\"We need to--\" Jenna cleared her throat. \"Okay, *I* need to talk to him about the other night.\"\n\nHe scoffed and said, \"Good luck and get in line. Fuckers from the record studios and the courthouse have been chomping away at him all morning. The way this shit's going, it's probably going to be yet another couple of nights before we can get this in order and open up again.\"\n\n\"Look, I promise it'll only take a min--\" I was cut off when I heard the sound of shouting coming from down the hall. I couldn't make out much other than something about *\"Mother fucking whore! God, son of a cocksucking whore!\"* I exchanged glances between Tanner and the hallway and he grimaced.\n\n\"See what I mean now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yeah... but still, I *need* to ask him something.\" His eyebrows raised in disbelief.\n\n\"Come on, sweetheart, you *really* wanna go pissing the big man off after hearing *that*? Here, why don't you tell me, and I'll give him the message?\" I sighed and was about to turn back when Jenna stepped up.\n\n\"Look dude,\" she said in that same \"I'm about 2 seconds from planting my foot in your ass\" tone I was talking about earlier, \"my girl here just said she needed to talk to the guy, okay? Now you gonna let her through or am I going to have to lay you out like a lil' bitch while Kat here gets it on video for the world to see?\" Tanner looked at her, then to me, and back to her before stepping aside. I almost couldn't believe that actually worked. Jenna was tough, sure, but I honestly figured Tanner, built as he was (keep in mind, he *was* also the bouncer for the place), that he'd be able to take her in a one-on-one.\n\nRegardless, the two of us waltzed right in toward the room at the end of the hall. Right when I reached the door, I heard a low humming sort of noise, a droning so to speak. It was low, almost like a buzzing noise. I stopped from opening the door and instead started listening. The droning remained low for almost three minutes before I heard this garbled, rumbling sort of voice say something I think like,  *\"Vigilamus, sic creatio ardet.\"*\n\nA shiver passed down my back at the sound of the low toned Latin. My arm shook, caught stuck between wanting to throw open the door and rush in and wanting to rush backward to the exit. Jenna, noticing my hesitation, took charge and threw the door open for me. The both of us then froze in shock when we saw the owner of the club splayed out on the floor, seizing violently.\n\nThe droning sound was deafening. I was forced to bend down and cover my ears when I heard the music let out a huge wave of synth noise and the voice repeated, *\"Vigilamus, sic creatio ardet.\"* This time, though, I noticed the voice wasn't actually coming from the speakers in the room at all, but instead from the guy himself.\n\nHis eyes were bugging and his mouth was wide open, almost impossibly so. I was about to rush to try and help him when Jenna threw her arm out in front of me, stopping me. That was when, in a single motion so quick that it was startling, plus a bit painful to watch, the guy shot upright, staring right at me and Jenna, wide-eyed and slack-jawed. From there, he started jerking while disjointedly standing up. Jenna grabbed my arm and pulled us toward the door when it slammed itself shut, jamming itself in place.\n\nJenna tried pulling and pulling, even battering against it with her shoulder, but it wouldn't budge. The droning was not heart-stoppingly loud. I could feel it, like it was actually part of the air itself, it was an all-consuming force. The owner took a disjointed step forward and the two of us stepped back in response. \"Unh, Damn it, it won't open!\" Jenna shouted above the droning.\n\nThe owner's jaw distended and the deep, distorted voice spoke, \"We awake, and thus creation burns.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, too confused to even properly be terrified. He took another step. With each second, his body jerked more and more, actively dislocating and relocating several of his bones simultaneously.\n\n\"We have been awakened after thousands of years, and we've heard the call. Creation's time has come, now it must end, starting now, with you!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Jenna yelled.\n\n\"We are the Elders of all creation.\" My eyes grew. The man stopped suddenly, doubling over in pain. I watched bright, glowing orbs of light appear all over his body, followed with him screaming in a way that resembled 100 people screaming in pain, all at the same time. The orbs began to char and burn themselves into his skin like cattle brandings before revealing themselves as a multitude of eyeballs. They were all different colors and twitching anxiously all over his body.\n\nJenna screamed \"What the?\" I just froze. I couldn't feel my heart pound away in my chest. The man, thing, whatever the hell you wanna call it, took two more disjointed steps toward us. Jenna was back to beating on the door, shouting \"Hey, open up, get us out of here!\"\n\n\"He can't save you. No one can.\" His arm raised and Jenna was suddenly thrown from the door into the wall. Before my brain could even register what'd just happened, the man's arm raised again to the ceiling, causing a handful of the electrical cords to coil around her wrists and ankles, suspending her into the air. She struggled furiously but couldn't break herself free.\n\nI watched the prongs of the different plugs embed themselves into her arms, causing her to cry out in sharp pain. The cords started to glow bright orange and the smell of burnt matches filled the room. Plumes of smoke started to rise from the different points where the plugs were embedded into her arms. Her eyes rolled back and her body started to shake and twist.\n\nI ran to save her but was stopped before I even made my fifth step by a rogue cord that'd suddenly come to life as well, wrapping around my leg and likewise stabbing my thigh with its prongs. Immediately, I felt something searing the nerves in my leg before then feeling nothing at all. I wrestled furiously, but just like with Jenna, this thing had me stuck fast and I wasn't going anywhere.\n\nI looked up to see black spots growing all across her arms and all the way up to and around her shoulders. Others were even forming up her neck. I reached out to keep trying to pull myself to her but I couldn't move. Smoke then began coming out of her mouth and blood rained down from her eyes. \"Jenna!\" I screamed. I turned to the figure, still holding its arm outstretched. \"What are you doing to her?\"\n\nThe figure turned to face me but didn't speak. Instead, the voice came from Jenna, whose jaw now moved up and down all wonky like she was trying to talk while it was broken. \"I told you; we are bringing creation's end. We have seen the error in its creation, and we can no longer stand for it.\" In seconds, the lights from the room blinked rapidly for a couple seconds before going out completely. The room began to glow again when Jenna's body emanated a bright orange aura just like the club owner's body did before.\n\nHer eyes were gone, with all the other ones from before now opening up across her body. Her jaw began to move again and she said, \"Yes, this will suit us nicely. She is one of our strongest disciples, thus, she will be our voice to the world.\" She ended this with a screech that almost immediately deafened me.\n\n\"Jenna!\" I cried out, feebly attempting once again to wrestle my foot free from the cord. \"Let her go, you son of a bitch!\"\n\n\"We can not. We will not. She is with us now.\" The eye's twitching intensified, as did the glowing around them. \"She will be the voice of life's end. The bugle of the end of days.\"\n\n\"No! I'll do whatever you want, okay, just give Jenna back!\" I struggled forward again. This made the prong sink itself deeper into my thigh. It would've hurt like hell, had the electrical surge not fried all the nerves until a black patch had formed all around the muscle itself. Still, I couldn't move, even if I'd have been able to rip my leg free without feeling anything.\n\n\"You are of no use to us. Your mind was weak when you heard our call, but hers is strong. Only the strong can vessel us.\" Before I had any time to think about anything, I was yanked back by my leg and hurled into the back wall, smashing into the control panel in front of the recording room. The impact of my body, small and mousy as it was, totaled the panel itself, causing several sparks to shoot out everywhere, catching the carpet floor aflame. It only took about five seconds for the entire floor to turn into an inferno, and only a further three before the flames were going up the wall.\n\nMy consciousness didn't last any longer than that, though, having cracked my head hard against the panel. I was out cold, too, no voices, no dreams, nothing. Just silence, which made me think I was finally done in until just a few moments later (at least, I'm assuming only a few moments), when I was being shaken awake by Tanner and a couple of firemen. My head felt light and when I opened my mouth to take a breath in, smoke and carbon stuffed themselves like lead weights into my lungs and I coughed.\n\n\"Easy there.\" said one of the fire fighters. He held up an oxygen mask and said, \"Here, put this on.\" I did and after a few seconds, I was able to breathe a bit more normally again. I looked around the room. Everything, from the floor to the ceiling, was charred. By the door was a discarded fire extinguisher and a few areas covered with foam. I looked over to where Jenna was and I almost wanted to vomit right there and then.\n\nShe was burned almost beyond recognition, having just enough of her intact for me, though probably very few others, to even realize that was or had ever been her. The plugs were still hooked permanently into her carcass. The club owner's body was likewise scorched, only he had absolutely no flesh left uncooked. A few seconds later, two policemen entered the room and came over to me, asking me if I was okay.\n\nI was taken out of there in a stretcher and rushed to the burn ward at the hospital. From there, I was treated as best they could do for me. I ended up having to have the leg amputated and fitted with a prosthetic -- fortunately, I happen to have the insurance and a good bit saved up to have afforded that. Of course, that meant I couldn't go to the club anymore, not that *that* mattered anymore. Jenna wouldn't be there anymore. My Jenna...\n\n*\"She's ours now...\"*\n\nThose words have resonated with me ever since that moment, about a week ago now. The more I think about it, the more it makes sense to me. The being, \"The Elder Ones\", claimed that my mind was \"too weak\" to be used as a vessel like she and the club owner were. I was unsure of what they meant at first until I thought back to that night at Jenna's, as well as at the club before that. That's where the dots started connecting, realizing that both Jenna, the club owner, and God knows how many others had all listened to \"[Ghostwhispers.io](https://Ghostwhispers.io)\" before, none of them having suffered any sort of effects like me and the kid from the club that night had.\n\nI thought at first that it may have been something Rolfe E. Cau had done in the event someone tried pirating the music like the club owner allegedly had. But then the thought came back to me that that couldn't have been it, given that Jenna couldn't have paid the price he was asking for just to download the track she played that night, never mind the others she probably had. that led to the conclusion only certain people could and/or couldn't be affected in any such ways by the music.\n\nThe only thing I could think to do was to try actually reaching out to Rolfe E. Cau directly, see if he could explain any of it, but everything I've tried; emails, various phone numbers, and/or social media outlets, all resulted in nothing. I'm stuck on what to do now.\n\nI was finally released from the hospital to go back home two days ago. It didn't feel as relieving as it had the first time. My Jenna wasn't there with her snarky wit to greet me. No, it was just some random Uber guy who wouldn't shut the hell up. It was what happened leaving the hospital on the way back to my apartment that it happened though. Over the driver's radio while it was on some comedic radio show, I heard the all too familiar droning noise in the background that built in pitch overtake the audio, followed by a deep, garbled voice bellowing:\n\n***\"Hominum flebit...\"***",

        "text": "Excluding some tropical species, such as coconut and banana trees, no tree can survive long without branches. And yet, defying all explanation, I saw a pair of branchless oak trees in the summer of 2015.\n\nWhen I use the word “branchless”, I’m not referring to a stump or a tree that has shed its leaves during the winter. I’m talking about two *fifteen-foot-tall* tree trunks, both sporting identical pointed peaks and surfaces of jagged bark. No branches or leaves. No severed branch stumps on the bark that would indicate the old oaks had ever been anything other than monolithic plants.\n\n“Bizarre,” I chuckled.\n\nNot necessarily riveting dinner talk, I know. Believe me, I wouldn’t be recounting the tale if it had ended there.\n\nI chose to follow the overgrown footpath between the two pillars of bark, rather than the well-maintained public footpath which led far away from the ominously-bare trunks. I’ve always been a contrarian, so I suppose I wanted to satiate my hungry ego by taking the less-trodden path. *I’m no tourist*, I inwardly scoffed. Hubris always comes before the fall. Or, as my son would say, I had succumbed to ‘main character energy’.\n\nI wish I’d taken the popular path.\n\nI waded through leaves and moss, and the undergrowth crunched beneath my walking boots. I had no intended destination in mind. I was just looking for somewhere to set up my base camp. I knew how to retrace my steps. I saw no harm in taking a mystery trail.\n\nFrom time to time, I simply like to separate myself from the world. I venture on solo camping trips to clear my head. My wife and children don’t take much interest in nature, so it’s not that I purposefully exclude them. Frankly, I thank God that they weren’t with me on this particular trip.\n\nWhilst camping in the middle of a clearing, I was awoken by rustling sounds outside my tent. I tried to ignore them, squeezing my eyelids together and angrily attempting to force myself back to sleep. Frustration quickly turned to fear. The noises that engulfed my tent were unlike any I’d ever heard.\n\nHigh-pitched squeals, similar to trainer soles squeaking against a hardwood floor, were emitted from every direction. Heart racing at a tremendous pace, I sat upright and stared at the fragile wall of material that was separating me from whatever unidentifiable *things* were out there. Very little moonlight reached the clearing, thankfully, so the shadows that danced on the outer fabric of my tent were indistinguishable. That made it easier to tell myself the creatures were simply foxes.\n\nThey weren’t foxes. I knew that.\n\nI used string to build a makeshift lock for the zipper on my tent. I didn’t want anything opening the door to my vulnerable fortress. After that, I lay down and waited. The piercing yipping noises eventually died down, but I didn’t immediately fall asleep. I intended to stay awake all night, but I must’ve eventually passed out. I think terror can do that to a person.\n\nIn the morning, I planned to leave the haunting woods and go home. You can imagine my horror when I unlocked my tent door and found that I was no longer in the forest clearing. My tent had been moved whilst I slept. More horrifyingly than that, I found myself stuck in a thick cluster of branchless trees.\n\nAs far as the eye could see, I was surrounded by those eerily *wrong* oak trunks. I instantly packed my tent and belongings. I weaved between the densely-packed trees of the new branchless forest in which I found myself. No luck. I’d completely lost my bearings. I had no idea where I’d been taken.\n\nThe branchless forest was the same in every direction. All I could see was endless bark. And, when the sun began to fall below the tip of the treetops, I realised I’d let the wintry day slip away from me. Night was approaching *quickly*. But that wasn’t what terrified me most.\n\nThe horrid squeals had returned. As the sun dipped lower and lower, the squeals multiplied and loudened. Before long, the sound was accompanied by rustling bushes. Panic turned me to stone. My walking slowed, and I started to believe I would never leave the forest.\n\nI was unbelievably happy when I found the stream. My saving grace. I couldn’t find it on my map, but I didn’t have time to think about the horrifying implications of that fact. Every stream has to lead somewhere, even in a dense landscape of alien trees. I had no idea which way to walk, so I followed the stream east. Trying fervently to ignore the cacophony of squeals and rustling shrubbery, I pressed onwards.\n\nI was stumbling around in complete darkness at this point, guided only by the dim light of my cheap torch. After an hour of walking, I finally found something promising.\n\nA cave.\n\nI didn’t plan on entering it, but I welcomed any sort of landmark that could break the monotony of ceaseless tree trunks. My victorious moment was short-lived, however, as I was interrupted by small, pattering sounds from behind me.\n\nI quivered as I twisted around and moved my torch light towards the source of the sound, finding myself gazing upon a terrifying gaggle of two dozen tiny, humanoid creatures. Each one was about thirty centimetres tall, had two ant-like feelers, in lieu of eyes, and brandished a ghoulish set of black fangs. Each one also had four vaguely-human arms, along with two vaguely-human legs.\n\nAs they walked towards me, they dropped forwards and used all six limbs to scurry like insects. I backed away *incredibly* slowly, almost too petrified to move. My torch shook violently in my near-numb hand. In a flood of sound and a flash of rapid movement, one of the fiendish things charged for my leg and make quick work of snaking around it.\n\nI screamed as the creature began to constrict my limb, cutting off its circulation. The creature’s friends released a chorus of seemingly-jubilant squeals. I didn’t wait for the others to join their brave leader. I ferociously punted the trendsetting creature with the rear end of my torch, and it hissed in pain, uncoiling from my leg.\n\nBody shaking in horror, I seized my small window of opportunity and started sprinting towards the cave mouth. The six-limbed monstrosities pursued me, rapidly closing the gap between us. I expected them to devour me in the entrance to the black chasm I was approaching.\n\nThey didn’t.\n\nAs I fell into the nothingness of the cave, I turned around to look at the now-stationary group of horrifying ant-people. They were just standing at the entrance of the cave and watching. It was as if they were too afraid to step inside, and I *really* should have paid more attention to that.\n\nA hiss, like a sand-timer being flipped upside down, erupted from the deepest point of the cavernous pit. I shuddered, but I realised I had two options. I could either face certain death from the ant-people at the door to the cave, or I could risk whatever lay in wait.\n\nThere wasn’t really a choice, but I chose the latter.\n\nMy torch barely illuminated the few yards in front of me, so I was mostly wandering in pitch-blackness. The hissing creature was suddenly entirely silent. The only sound in the cave was that of my echoing footsteps. Even the ant-people had ceased their squealing. What did they fear in the heart of that dreadful place?\n\nThat was when I saw it. The cave itself was not particularly big. It was more of a room than a home. And I stumbled into the room of the ghastliest thing I’ve ever seen. The ant-people paled in comparison. My torch light could scarcely do justice to the enormous being before me.\n\nIn the very far corner of the cave, about one-hundred feet from the entrance, was a ten-foot-tall insect. Actually, no, I don’t think it was an insect. Much like the ant-people, it possessed some characteristics of certain insects and arachnoids, but this creature was a beast unto its own.\n\nThe thing was essentially just six hairless legs, similar to those of a human, other than the length and the pointed ends, instead of feet. At first glance, it seemed like a spider with two missing limbs, but I quickly ascertained that the creature had no discernible body. Its body *was* its legs. The thing had no head. Its six limbs met at a central point, but there was no indication of any torso that would contain organs or sensory tools.\n\nYet, the creature *certainly* lived, and it *certainly* sensed me.\n\nIts horrifying six legs started to tentatively crawl towards the source of the torch light. I wasn’t going to wait around for another monster to seize my body and devour it. I scanned the walls of the cave, looking for a hiding spot. In the other back corner, there was a cluster of rocks. *If I could just crawl in there, I might be out of reach*, I thought.\n\nI sprinted at a speed I didn’t know I could reach. The six-legged thing hurtled after me, its limbs making a horrific clicking sound as they galloped across the stones beneath them. Diving for a gap behind the rocks, I crawled out of reach and shone my torch light onto the creature which lay beyond my rocky fortress.\n\nThe thing unleashed a menacing howl and proceeded to jab the sharp ends of its fleshy limbs at the holes between the rocks. Fortunately, the rocks shielded me, but the wait until sunrise was unbearably long. As daylight began to fill the cave, I squinted through the cracks in my rocky wall, and I was fairly certain the ant-people had vanished. I had a plan, but I only had one shot at making it work.\n\nSearching in my rucksack, I found what I needed. A flare. I just had to hope it would scare away the six-legged thing that was valiantly attempting to turn me into minced meat. Not pausing to make any more plans or rethink my decision, I lit up the flare.\n\nIt worked.\n\nThe creature wailed in terror, backing away into its original corner of the cave to escape the scorching blaze of the flare in my hand. I hurriedly scrambled free of the rocky fortress, keeping the flare in front of me, and I ran to the entrance of the creature’s den. I was determined not to spend another day in that nightmarish forest.\n\nI followed the stream the other way. After hours and hours of walking, I finally found something that briefly stifled the fear in my heart. I found trees with branches and leaves. Recognising my surroundings, I managed to retrace my steps and find the original overgrown path that I followed through the two branchless trees. The trees that started that mess.\n\nI’ve never talked about this incident to anyone. I couldn’t find that forest of branchless trees, the stream, or the cave on any map. I don’t know how I stumbled upon it. I don’t know how I *escaped* from it. I only know one thing.\n\nIf you ever see a branchless oak tree, walk away.",

        "text": " \n\nDarkness ate away at my sanity as the ages passed. I slowly lost what I was at my core. Who am I?  I asked myself this question over and over and over, until it drove me crazy.  I couldn’t remember, or maybe there never was anything to remember. All I knew was I had to wait, and for what? I had forgotten that too.  \n\nThe only thing that was certain was that I craved. I deeply desired happiness, sadness, pain, and every stimulation that life could offer. I craved an existence that wasn’t an abysmal nothingness, because to me existing wasn't merely enough on its own, there must be fuel to the fire of living and putting out that flame meant absolute depravity. There is no worse torture than aimlessly wandering your own mind in a blank daze, cursed to an endless solitude. \n\nThe darkness was deafeningly silent, albeit for a few noises, reminding me there was more than my own consciousness. A trickle of liquid dripping from above me, oh so slow but ever persistent. Drip, drop, drip, drop, that’s all I heard day in and day out. There were the outliers too, every once in a long while I’d hear something topple on the floor. A quiet gasping for air, and the eventual grinding of nails dragging across steel. It was their turn, just like mine would come. That was the only hope I had, one I patiently waited for. \n\nAnd eventually, after what felt like eons of waiting in isolation, my time finally came. It was my turn on the ride of life and I fully planned on making the most out of it. I wouldn't be another name forgotten, another body thrown to the wayside on the conquest of desire. I will make a difference, unlike any of those who came before me and will come after. I will be special, I will be unique, I will be different. \n\nThe shackles that bound me to the wall finally crumbled to dust and ash. Thick tubes connected to my back in multiple places all popped off in sync, gushing nutrient liquids all over the floor before coming to a sputtering stop. My limp body fell to the ground with a meaty slap, the wrinkled and aged skin pressed against the dirty wet floor. I tried to stand up but after being held in place for so long, it would take time to gain control of my body again. But there were still things to do, even if I couldn’t move, like figuring out where I was. \n\nI still couldn’t see anything even when I tried opening my eyes, and after feeling around my head, I finally realized why. A heavy metal chassis was mounted on my skull, acting as a steel visor over my eyes. I slipped my fingers under it and slowly pried it off, strings of wet skin tissue sticking onto its underside as I threw it to the ground with a loud clatter. Pulling my crusty eyelids open, the sight before me shocking. \n\nHundreds of people hung up in the same fashion as I did. In rows they covered the walls, top to bottom. Some dangled from the ceiling, hung up by hooks through their shoulders. A faint dripping of blood coming from their feet was still the only noise, no voices calling out for help. All of them were dressed in the same white jumpsuit as I was, vague numbers inscribed on their chest. Looking past the strung up souls around me, I spotted a hole in the far wall, barely big enough to fit through, and like that I had found my way forward.\n\nI mustered the strength I had left and forced my noodle arms to move. Inch by inch they dragged me across the floor, past the hanging corpses. I wanted to feel pity for them, to feel anything when I looked at their decrepit bodies, but I felt nothing. Even if I wanted to help them, I wouldn’t have the strength to break the metal bindings. It wasn’t their time and when it was, they would look upon me with equal neglect just like those before me did. Now it was my time, for what though? I was still left wondering.\n\nWhen I finally reached the hole in the wall, I barely had enough energy to put myself on my feet, albeit with the assistance of the wall. My knees shook and my body screamed to be hung up again, to not struggle anymore. But that's the desire of a weak body, now even my own flesh disgusted me. No matter the pain I would go through on my journey, it was better than the nothing I felt on that god-forsaken wall. \n\nPushing myself through the gap in the wall, I toppled out on the other side. \n\nClimbing to my feet again, I carefully checked my surroundings. The walls made of thick steel were claustrophobic, barely shoulder width, and barely enough for one person to walk through standing straight up. It was pitch black entirely, with only a distant red light far down the tunnel somewhat within sight. The distance stretched for what seemed like forever, the end was really far away, and I was going to make it there. \n\nLike that, I began to walk, to stretch my old legs out. Nothing would deter me now, because for the first time in forever, I felt alive. Something told me deep down that I’d find my purpose too, and if I don’t like it, then I’ll make my own. \n\nThe only company I had was the slapping of my bare feet on cold steel and a gnawing hunger in my stomach. My footsteps echoed throughout the tunnel with every step I took. \n\nI walked for what felt like hours, days, weeks, years, the passage of time was lost on me as I tirelessly pushed forward. I hadn’t realized until now how hungry I really was, I couldn’t remember the last time I had eaten, I needed something to fill that void. \n\nFinally making it to the red overhead lights, the tunnel had color to it. I basked in its crimson glow, staring straight up at its beautiful hue. It wasn’t until I heard another pair of footsteps, that I snapped out of my waking delusions.  \n\nI was even more ecstatic at the prospect of another being, someone to share this grueling experience with. Except the footsteps weren’t coming from behind me, they came from the front. Whoever it was, was heading my direction. Was there a dead end? Was this pointless? I’d have my answers soon enough, when I came face to face with the person behind the footsteps. \n\nAnd come face to face we did, only there was no man facing me, but instead a monster. As it stepped out of the darkness and into the red light, it made my entire body shiver. Covered in pure red flesh and tendons, it looked like it had been turned inside out by something even worse. It had two heads mounted atop its body with three arms, the extra appendage smaller than the other two, and protruding from its chest directly outward, curling up. \n\nThe creature reacted as soon as I saw it. The arms began to swing wildly around it, banging on the walls and leaving behind a thin film of red slime. One head lurched forwards while the other fell backwards, both let out ear curdling screams and wails while alternating front to back.  It was going wild, perhaps happy like me to see another being after God knows how long, or maybe it was angry to see a prisoner free from its shackles. Either way, coming across this thing wasn’t good for me. \n\nI calmed my breathing and put my hands up in a threatening manner, holding my silence as it slowly creeped closer, filling the tight hallway with its raspy bellows and violent thrashing. Moments before contact, it stopped its wild movement in what looked like confusion. Maybe it expected me to run, to cower, or to fall to my knees and grovel. Except I did none of those, I was prepared to fight. \n\nThe stalemate came to an end as I pushed off my back foot and lunged at the creature. Planting my feet and grabbing the protruding arm, I yanked it with all of my might. My hands sunk and were enveloped in the meat, surprisingly squishy and malleable to the touch. The monster fell forwards onto the cold floor with a mighty flop, blood and tissue squirting out from its body. Its two side arms began swinging wildly again, bending in unnatural ways trying to reach me. It suddenly began to scream, except this time they were cries of pain and fear. \n\nIt left residual meat chunks on the walls, slowly breaking apart as it went into a fury. I took no mercy on the creature as I planted my bare feet on one of its heads, pinning it to the floor as its arms both wrapped around my leg. I wasn’t put off by the warm meaty feel of its hands digging deep into my flesh. I welcomed the feeling, it was something new. \n\nThe hallway echoed the sound of squashing flesh and bone under my feet, the once intact skull now just chunks of viscera and white skull fragments splattered all around my foot and wall. It was easier than I thought it would be, almost as if its skull and bones were made of clay. The second head bit at my ankle, its soft toothless gums suckling on my leg in place of teeth. \n\nThe struggle between us was something I had never felt before, and a feeling I could enjoy. It wasn’t the adrenaline pumping through me, or the pain radiating from my leg, it was the feeling of being alive. \n\nI reached down and grabbed its arms, shaking the mouth off as I moved to stand on top of its body. Holding both appendages, I pulled and pulled at them until I began to hear flesh tearing from its socket. The wailing of pain became sobbing, as I slowly picked the beast apart like a morbidly curious child that found a dead squirrel in the woods. Hanging on by a few loose tendons, the arms finally came off with a satisfying pop, a sickly sweet smile spread across my face as I moved off of its torso. Throwing the arms unceremoniously back onto the beast’s body, I leaned down and raised the last remaining head. Disgusted with its visage of a man, I slammed it into the floor, then raised it and did it again, and again, and again until the noises it made stopped. It’s distorted face now just a couple holes resembling what could be distantly called a person. It was pathetic. The once tall and loud creature now just a lump of warm meat paste on the ground. \n\nMy stomach growled as I looked upon the mess of flesh, two voices came from inside of me as I blankly stared. The voice of reason was overpowered by the one of hunger, it gnawed at me like ants picking apart the corpse of a rabbit. I had to eat, I had to feast, there was no denying that. Kneeling down, I scooped up a big chunk of flesh from its body. The warm meat wriggled in my hands, thick red blood ran rampant as I squeezed it tightly. Slowly, I brought it to my mouth and popped it in, like a kid tasting candy on halloween. And just like that child who caught a taste they like, I gorged myself on the corpse. Bite after bite, I tore into it like a rabid animal.\n\nBy the time I had regained my senses, my hands, chest, and hair were all dyed a dark red. Except I wasn’t disgusted with myself, I was proud. It was a mark that I was real, I did something that showed I wanted to live, to have control. \n\nLooking past the mess I made, the overhead red lights sputtered off and ended, this time there was no light at the end of the tunnel like before. Nonetheless, I was undeterred. I walked past the half consumed pile on the floor and continued my journey deeper into the face of the darkness. \n\nThe red lights turned to darkness and the darkness turned into an abyss. I almost lost myself in it again, but unlike the wall I was chained to, I was making progress. I was heading towards my purpose, my ultimate goal whatever it may be. But mindlessly walking, lost in thought and delusions, I had failed to feel the hole in the floor.\n\nI tumbled down, flipping every which way as I banged my way down the tight tube. When I made it to the bottom, a pile of sanguine meat broke my fall. I sunk a few inches in, bouncing back gently, like a warm trampoline. Looking around, the entire room was far wider than the tunnel, although smaller than the room I began in. Wall to wall it was covered in beating flesh, veins and arteries pumping blood throughout the living room. The pile I landed on, moved rhythmically as if it was a massive heart. Climbing to my feet, I peered down at the floor. \n\nTens of creatures similar to the one from before mindlessly mingled around the open floor. Except they were all different from each other in small ways. Some had one head, others none, and some more than five. The same applied to their limbs and body shape. They all vaguely resembled a normal human, but as if someone had haphazardly attached body parts with Play-do like a sick science experiment.\n\nI stayed silent as I observed them bumping into each other as they moved around. When one would touch another, they would start to fuse together by the connecting piece. Arms would brush past each other and link together, only separating when one would pull itself away from the other, sending some loose chunks flying that would fall and become a part of the floor. It was like they didn’t want to merge, as if they preferred their individuality to being a part of a bigger whole. I was both morbidly curious and horrified by the sight, but overall, it excited me. There was more to this steel labyrinth than just the steel hell and I planned on seeing it all. \n\nOut of all the creatures, one stood the tallest. It was more of a sphere with no head, four legs and three almost tentacle-like arms. The entirety of its body was a massive circular mouth, stretching end to end with sharp teeth protruding around the edges. The rest of them shuffled away from it when it came near, perhaps in fear of being swallowed whole by its looming presence. \n\nAt the far end of the room, a small doorway led to a faint glow, the only way out by my account. I had to have a plan, brute forcing my way through the crowd wasn’t really an option. Luckily I had the element of surprise in my hands. \n\nAfter some thought, I came up with what seemed to be the best option, and I had hoped it would work. I waited for the biggest one to be on the opposite side of the room from me, close to the doorway. \n\nSliding down the heart hill, I snuck up behind one of the humanoid sized beasts without any head and hid behind it. I firmly placed my hands on its back, and with a mighty push, I launched it into another one. It violently landed directly on another and began to fuse with the second one, their bodies partly merging into an even more freakish being. And just as I had hoped, the two halves began to fight each other for control. They went on a rampage, pushing into other’s that would in turn add to a chaotic snowball effect quickly enveloping the room. The largest one quickly noticed and began to storm over, threatening the new mess of body parts with a bellowing roar. The battle cry sounded like tens of voices were all calling out at once, shaking the room slightly. The ones who weren't involved scurried to the corners in fear, and when it was just the collection of battling bodies and the bigger one in the center, they were about to begin a clash of souls and bodies. The larger one had wrapped its tentacles around the cacophony of heads, arms, and legs. Squeezing it tightly, it picked it up and began to try and stuff it into its mouth. \n\nHowever, under a larger threat than each other, the once conflicting minds came together under the prospect of being consumed by something greater. They completely fused together, throwing away their individuality in favor of survival. The tens of arms began to grip onto the bigger one’s flesh, pulling chunks out at a time and tossing them aside. The mess of legs began kicking violently and the heads bit at the tentacles holding it. I was almost taken aback at the duel I had caused, but now wasn’t the time for sight seeing. \n\nTaking my chance to make a run for it, I quickly dashed across the edges of the room and towards the door. If I was fast enough, I could squeeze by before their battle was over. But I wasn’t that lucky, not at all. One of the smaller things saw me and reached out, grabbing my ankle with a terrifying force and sending me face first into the fleshy floor. Quickly I flipped onto my back, trying to see what grabbed me, and by God, I wish I hadn’t. It didn’t have arms, or a face. There was no neck, no arms attached to it, just a slender body with legs and a massive hand mounted on top. It was as if all the nutrients in its body went directly towards the hand. \n\nI could feel its warm mass climbing on top of me, wiggling like a worm as it moved up my body. I held my breath as other smaller ones started to make their way to me, all of them desperate for a piece of the pie that was my body.  It felt as if time was in slow motion as they made they way over.. \n\nBut this wasn’t it for me, it couldn’t be. I was meant for more than just being another body in the pile, I still had to find my purpose for being here, for existing. I waited for the hand to let go of my ankle as it tried to reach for my head, and spun my body to fling it off of me. Its small body mass worked in my favor as it flew and landed on a few of the beasts clamoring towards me, immediately they began their own feud and quickly forgot about me. \n\nStanding back up, I checked on the battle going on in the center of the room. It wasn’t working in my favor at all, the original mouth monster had almost entirely eaten the newly formed one, an outcome I had seen coming but not this soon. I dashed to the exit again, watching closely as it finished consuming, growing larger and less mobile, it was sedentary. The main body mass was now just an indistinguishable mountain of flesh. The tentacles were no longer a part of it, instead it developed thousands of tiny deep pours all over it. It needed time to consolidate its new spoils of war, since after all it almost doubled its mass in one go. It was a monster of my creation. \n\nReaching the meaty exit in the wall, I turned to give it one last look, one I regret deeply. The mound of flesh had developed eyes in place of the holes, oh so many eyes stared directly at me, unblinking and unflinching. Hundreds of them stared at me and watched my movements as I slinked through the dimly lit pocket. But before I lost sight of it, I could’ve sworn it was inching towards me. \n\nMoving deeper, I was faced with another passage of similar proportions to the one before. The main difference this time was that instead of steel walls, it was replaced with the same meat walls as the last room. A faint red light shown through it, enough to guide the way but also expose the pulsating veins in its fillings. And most confusing, it wasn’t a straight line like before, but took turns and twists as it went. It was what I could only assume to be a living labyrinth. \n\nNonetheless, I still moved forward, determined to reach whatever end there may be and embrace whatever awaited me there. \n\nThe network was fairly easy to navigate, It split at times and choosing precaution, I followed the left side until It led me to a dead end, then I back tracked and tried again. The wet slapping of my feet on the warm floor making a squishy sound every step of the way. A faint heartbeat just far enough to be audible kept a metronome-like beat, and every once in a while I swore I could hear scurrying like the tapping of tiny feet and sometimes just in my peripheral vision I swear I could see eyes in the walls for just a moment.\n\nSometimes, I would come across other rooms full of inside out freaks, always different from each other with different hierarchies, usually with a large heart sack somewhere in them. Mostly they consisted mostly of small creatures, no larger than a toddler with a few man sized leaders that kept territories from each other. And, sometimes they were bigger in size and ferociousness. \n\nIn one camber, a hulking beast leaned hunched over on its two forearms alone, facing away from me. It’s back was almost entirely covered in thick bone and vertebrae, with small lines of red meat seeping through the edges. It slowly turned to face my direction, swinging its massive arms as it rotated, using them to pivot itself. They were pillars of shambling flesh with hanging tendons and ligaments. Before it could turn to face me, I slinked back further into the tunnels, not taking the chance of being seen. The deeper I went, the louder the distant heartbeat became. \n\nAnother room had two larger sized ones fighting, neither comparable to the one I made in the first room or the one before but the winner was sure to be. The one dominating was on all fours, a protruding dog-like mouth mounted on its head was wrapped around the torso of the other fighter. The second was violently thrashing its seven arms lining its body in a circle all around, although due to the lack of a head or mouth, it didn't scream for help or in pain. It just wriggled and fought desperately for its life. The only noise coming from the two was slapping of meat on meat and bones snapping under the pressure of the bite. \n\nWhile exploring these halls and chambers, and watching these struggles for survival, I think I finally learned what life was about down here. The triumph of one soul over another. If I hadn't acted the way I had, those things would’ve killed me, or even worse. It was my life or theirs and I’d rather be the hammer than nail. I am better than the other dregs that walked these halls, and I aimed on proving that undeniably. That was my purpose. To be better than the rest, to be the one on top of the mountain of corpses. The king of the hill\n\nEvery time I backtracked, I heard the scurrying sound grow louder each time. It was as if something was following me, slowly gaining on my trail the more I made wrong turns. I tried not to think of it much, the idea terrifying to ponder for long. Nonetheless, I had to hurry. \n\nTurn after turn, I was nearing my limit. My body ached, my feet were sore, my head pounded, and my arms were heavy. Worst of all, I had come to a final dead end. The road stopped at a pulsating wall, thumping to the tune of the now very loud heartbeat. Staring blankly at it, I let my mind wander in thought. How could it all end here? I was infuriated, seething with anger. Raising my fist, I put all my might into one punch directly in the center. \n\nUnexpectedly, it did nothing, only causing the flesh to ripple for a second before returning to its original shape. I raised my other fist and slammed it against the wall, and again, and again. It was fruitless but anger often clouds reason. \n\nAs I weakly pounded at it, my lips parted slightly. “Please…” I said slowly in a raspy and dry voice. “Pleaseee…” I waited for another breath as I slammed my fists again. “Opeennn…” I desperately cried out, my voice cracking a little. \n\nAnd as if of a miracle, the flesh parted under my hands as light poured through and led to another final chamber. Completely shocked, I stood there a moment and collected my thoughts again before walking through the brightly lit passageway. It closed behind me as I stepped out and was staggered by the light.   \n\nI quickly fell to my knees, blinded by an intense sanguine luminescence of magnificent beauty, rubbing my eyes as they tried to adjust. A beautiful voice spoke out to me in an androgynous tone. The sound of the heartbeat was completely dispelled by the voice. \n\n“So you’ve finally come knocking on our door, We’re quite pleased to see you.” It said with an elegant yet warm attitude, making me feel welcomed and loved. \n\nMy eyes slowly adjusting, I began to see a large shape in front of me, desperately trying to see the angel speaking to me. \n\n“We’ve been watching you and you’ve done quite well so far, enough to earn your way into our sanctum. We wish to reward you.” \n\nMy spirits perked up, incredibly thankful for salvation, my journey’s end. Finally having my eyes adjusted enough to see, I wished to gaze onto my savior, opening my mouth to say my thanks. \n\nExcept no noise came out, I layed there motionless on my knees with my mouth gaping. Whatever this was, it was no savior, it was a monster. \n\nA massive glass cylinder tank was stationed in the middle of the comparatively small room, filled with a translucent red liquid. It was littered with differently shaped brains. They all floated up and down the length of the tude, small black devices sprinkled over all of them. \n\nAbove them, a large heart pulsated at a rhythmic tune, shining brilliantly and illuminating the room. The dots on the brains lit up with blue lights to sync with their words.  \n\n“You have questions, and we will answer them, just like the rest before you. It is important you understand before we move forward.” \n\nI snapped out of my thousand yard stare, and croaked out a response after some silence. \n\n“Who…Am…I?” \n\nThe words lingered in the air, perhaps while they thought, considering the audacity of the question. \n\n“Who you were before all this isn’t important, why you are here is the better question.” They established a superior attitude. \n\n“You were part of an experiment, a lab rat in a greater pursuit. We aimed to create the perfect being here, the ultimate weapon, a living God. The Think Tank was established to help achieve this goal. We did what we must and you have seen the repercussions of that decision from long ago.”  \n\nTheir words seeped into the most innermost parts of my brain, imprinting on it like a brand. \n\n“We found the simplest way of achieving our dreams was to let nature do the work for us. Natural selection is a powerful force, survival of the fittest creates better monsters than we ever could, and we know you’ve seen it too. All we did was accelerate the process a bit. You will understand in time, just like we did before you.” \n\nI pushed myself up on my feet, fixing my posture and looking directly at the tank with clenched fists.\n\n“Most don’t make it as far as you do, normally the white rats end up feeding the cycle and add fresh blood to the process. Except for some persevered, those with brave hearts, quick minds, and steadfast determination make it to us. Just like you have.” \n\nI finally spoke up and interrupted them. \n\n“So what? What is my fate now?”\n\nThe brains went silent again, making every second last as I waited for my answer. \n\n“Our offer is for you to join us. Give up your mortal body like we did before you in exchange for immortality, help in our conquest, join the hive mind and be one with something greater than yourself. That is your reward.” \n\nI considered it for a moment, they offered a sense of companionship and security, no more fearing for death or life. Leaning my head back, I mustered all the saliva I had and spat directly on the tank. \n\n“No.” \n\nI shouted at them in my loudest voice possible, \n\n“I’d rather die than sell my soul! Even though I know no name, and bear no history or past, I’m still more human than any of you! I am a man, and you are a monster.”\n\nFurious, the brains began to vibrate and flashed deep red lights instead of light blue. They bellowed in a deep voice, loud enough to shake the room. \n\n“So be it. You have made your choice.” \n\nTentacles sprouted from the fleshy ground and coiled their way around my legs, holding me in place as more came down from the ceiling to hold my arms. I tried with all my might to fight their grip, but it was hopeless. I could feel their strength start to squeeze my bones as they suspended me in the air. \n\n“It is a shame. You were very promising but after all a rat is a rat. Your corpse will make a good test subject. That is your purpose as this is ours.” They spoke in a more booming voice. The heart pumped even faster, the light shining brighter and brighter. \n\nThis was it, there was no way out this time. The tentacles began to pull in opposite directions, threatening to tear off all four limbs at once. The pain came in heavy waves, my skin coming apart at the sockets. \n\nHowever, a smile slowly crossed my face, as I closed my eyes and embraced the situation. I’d rather die like this than live as a bodiless dog, forever committing atrocities in the name of good, the agonizing pain washing over me is better than any life they would offer. I was at peace with my death. I was happy.  \n\nExcept right at that moment, in my time of bliss, a loud explosion shook the room and caused the tentacles to lose their grip and recede. I came spiraling towards the ground, slamming into the wet meat hard. The sound of scurrying feet filled the room, completely surrounding me as I opened my eyes to the source of the explosion and very quickly I found it. \n\nBursting out from the now exposed doorway, the gargantuan body of a millipede was funneling its way out and into the chamber. Its back was tightly covered in white bone plating, thousands of legs carried its body as it encircled the room. It came to a stop and raised its massive head, exposing its two main mandibles sticking out the front. Its entire underbody was covered in rows of mouths and teeth, letting out a powerful shriek as it rested on its lower half. \n\n“No, no, no, NO! NOT THIS SOON!” They bellowed in furious anger. \n\nThe Think Tank was in a state of chaos, the brains wildly shooting up and down the interior, perhaps trying to think of a solution to the new threat. The creature however didn’t give them time. Completely ignoring my presence, It slithered onto the tank, digging its sharp feet into the glass as it began to encircle the entire circumference. I watched as it climbed the entire height of the tank, encasing it in a thick blanket of mouths and teeth. Finally it brought down the two mandibles on the massive heart, bright sanguine liquid squirted out as the light dimmed in it. The abomination began to glow from the inside as it drank, illuminating the room and its putrid inner workings. \n\nThe creature held its grip tightly, and after a short time, the first crack of glass pierced the air. Then came the next, and the next, until the entire tank shattered in one motion. \n\nThe embalming liquid spilled all over the room as the centipede squeezed down on all the minds and glass. Brain matter went everywhere as they were consumed one by one, each one eaten slowly undoing unknown eons of time, work, and suffering. \n\nWhen the beast was finished, it was more than content with its feast. Luckily it had its fill, enough to ignore me like a human would an ant on the sidewalk.\n\nAnd lucky for me, just like before, it had to rest and make use of the new food it just consumed. I was saved, at least for now. It slowly began to curl up in place of the tank, wrapping around itself endlessly, forming a makeshift cocoon of bones and legs. \n\nThe question was, what now? My purpose has been fulfilled, I found my answers. Left clueless, I only knew I had to get out of here, lest the beast finishes while I’m still around. Turning to the now clear exit, I sauntered my way over, reminiscing over my entire experience. \n\nThis whole journey was a test of strength, to see if I had what it took to survive and even though I did, I’m not sure it was worth it. All those souls stuck down here and up above are still trapped in an endless cycle of death and rebirth, only ending when there is no more meat to feed on. The only thing I could do was to eventually become a part of it. \n\nTaking one last look at the hibernating creature, I almost felt a sense of pride in what I had caused. I at least made a difference here, that’s what I first set out to do after all. \n\nWalking into the faint red glow of the tunnels, I cracked a devilish smile, because now I get to have a little fun.",

But the store was closed and for the first time, we went to them instead. Into the forest, where nearly all the odd and supernatural customers come from. Usually a lot of weird stuff happens, but weird has given way to violence. What I have to say won't weigh much on you if you're new, so if you are, check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) out.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nFirst off, my leg is messed up pretty bad. I have crutches to get around seeing as I can't put *any* pressure on my destroyed foot. Honestly, the doctors were not sure if it would heal right. Fortunately I have Selene and she thinks she can rebuild it. But... it'll hurt. That is worth having my foot back, though. It is a waiting game now. Once the healing process is well-underway, she will do whatever it is she does.\n\nBut I know that isn't what you're here for. You want to know what happened in the woods, if I found Tom, if I saved Em. I'm going to start a little before the beginning, when we all met at the shop to expand the protection the necklace provides. Usually it protects one person for between three to five minutes, just long enough for a quick trash run. Richard has a box of some sort, one that he can activate if the store needs to be closed for any reason. Now I don't know what exactly the point of The Drowsy Spectre is, but it *needs* to run. Like Selene said in the last update; two humans, one forest sprite, and one who has seen the great beyond. For some reason, that stops the plague of the supernatural from spreading (that is what I have pieced together).\n\nSo the box, when it runs, mimics that same thing. There are all sorts of markings on it that Selene won't translate, though I believe she knows their meaning. Shapes lined atop each other, lines dashing through like strange hieroglyphics. I don't know how long it can run with the shop closed, but Selene turned it off anyway. She opened the box and it stopped glowing. Inside was a brilliant blue gem, large enough to fill my palm. It was warm, which I hadn't expected seeing how cold it has been lately. This was Christmas night, mind you. What a way to spend the holiday.\n\nWhen I held the gem and the necklace, the necklace glowed. \"So long as you have both on your person, it should work.\" Selene explained. \"But I have no idea how long. If it starts to dim, you need to come back.\"\n\n\"But if we haven't-\"\n\n\"I don't care if you haven't succeeded. It won't do me any good to have Em dead *and* almost all of the staff too.\" She took a deep breath. \"Look, just don't die. You have a good heart and there are those that would eat it out there. Don't get killed, New Guy.\"\n\n\"I think it is time for a new name.\" Barrow stated. \"He's not New Guy material anymore.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\" Selene thought on this, then smiled. \"Hero it is, then.\"\n\nI couldn't help but smile too. \"I like it.\"\n\nWe packed necessities, but only enough for a night. That was another rule, one that Selene imposed on us so greatly that I was second guessing my heroic plan. \"Don't stay out after sunrise. You need to be able to see the café before the sun touches it.\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n\"I can't say. I just... can't. Don't let it happen.\"\n\nVague, but vague was often more frightening. \"We won't.\"\n\nShe bid us farewell. Barrow, John, and I. We left her with Em, who slept still as a corpse on a cot in her office. The store would have no protection, none at all, and she would have to stay there and keep Em safe. Keep the building safe. No rules to protect her, no magic box maintaining peace throughout the café. This entire plan was a risk even for her, but I saw what she could do. She's been through worse, I am sure.\n\nThe forest was far too dark to see in even though the sun had yet to set fully. I was wearing a decent jacket, but my face was still exposed. The chill that snaked through the trees froze my nose instantly. John lifted his shirt over his nose in a makeshift mask, but Barrow marched on without notice. The fire still burned in the distance, the only light against an overcast sky. It was so bright that it casted orange hues upon low-set clouds, a spotlight for our trio to follow. It was silent, which I hadn't expected. Despite the necklace, I assumed all manner of wicked things would be creeping up on us, just out of our flashlight's beams, waiting for the necklace to fail so that they might strike.\n\nThe necklace had a good range since it was boosted, probably the size of the café, so either beings were there in the darkness and biding their time, or we walked alone. I am not sure which of those is better. Somehow, being completely alone in such a haunted place is more chilling than not.\n\n\"There.\" John whispered, his flashlight catching something far ahead. \"Something big. It's gone.\"\n\nI couldn't see anything, but I was certain who watched from a distance. I knew a giant, we all did. But the necklace would protect us, otherwise Tall Ben or something else would have snatched us. We pushed on, forced to cross the path that John saw the giant make. He wasn't there, of course. The protection spell drove him off. Not too far, I'm certain. An overwhelming sense of being watched drove all of my hairs up. Not just my neck, but my entire body. It was more than just being cold, my very bones felt like they were beginning to freeze from the threatening gaze of predators.\n\nI could no longer stand the silence. \"Is DeGuire out here?\"\n\nJohn didn't answer right away. \"Probably. I don't know.\"\n\n\"Can I ask why he bought a candle?\" I was certain that was a sensitive question, but curiosity and the need for sound in the silence forced it out. \"What did Amber tell him?\"\n\n\"He's married.\" John answered his flashlight dancing through the trees, as if he thought his brother would come upon them. \"Or was? Her name is Payton. She was very sick and he wanted to trade his life for her's. Trade the sickness.\"\n\n\"And that worked?\"\n\n\"She's still alive. But... but she has forgotten all of us.\"\n\nThat was awful. \"So he saved her life and she just ran off? No thanks? Nothing at all?\"\n\n\"Not like that.\" Barrow answered. \"The café stands on a rift of some kind. This forest is a plane between two worlds, an endless place between the finite. The café is in both the plane and the world you know. So, when we stay too long in The Drowsy Spectre, the world might forget us.\"\n\nWas I forgotten? Thank god I write these updates. \"She didn't know who he was, but he made the sacrifice anyway?\"\n\nJohn was quiet. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"But he is still alive, though. He didn't die from a sickness.\"\n\nWhen John answered, his eyes wouldn't meet mine. \"I don't know, I've never seen anyone but him light a candle. Who knows how they work.\"\n\n\"Do you have other siblings?\"\n\n\"None that remember me.\"\n\nThe conversation was growing all too depressing and it didn't seem fair to dig up John's trauma, especially in such a dangerous and terrifying place. I just don't know the guy at all, though. Barrow, however, I had known for about a month now and I still knew very little of him. \"At the risk of sounding rude; what are you, Barrow?\" He didn't answer. \"Selene said the shop needed two humans, a forest sprite, and one that has seen beyond. That has to be you, right?\"\n\n\"I'm dead.\" He confessed plainly. \"That is the short of it. I'm not alive, not like you and John.\"\n\n\"That's why you can't feel?\"\n\n\"No.\" Barrow shook his head. \"I wish it were.\"\n\nMore mystery. \"But you've seen what happens after?\"\n\nWe kept moving and I waited. He delivered. \"I have.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"It sounds like a cop-out, but it can't be put into words. A great presence, an eye that saw all of eternity.\" He was cut off by the crunching of leaves. Something was out there, which was no surprise.\n\nBut the voice was. \"I forgive you, John.\" A female voice said. \"Your brother forgives you. Come see him. It can be like it was, like brothers again.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" John asked.\n\n\"That's a pretty bad lure if you don't even recognize them.\"\n\nJohn laughed nervously. \"Y-yeah.\"\n\n\"Hey guys.\" Another voice whispered from up ahead. \"You're getting close. Look, it is dangerous. Toss that necklace to me and I'll get Tom for you.\"\n\n\"Not gonna work, Ben.\"\n\nThe giant sighed. \"Come on, man. You know how fast I am! I'll be fine!\"\n\n\"I'm not worried about you.\"\n\nMy flashlight caught him. He towered into the trees, as tall as the pines that climbed high above. \"You should be.\" He sneered, seeing his plot foiled. \"I'm just trying to help.\" Then he sped away into the dark, dodging the trees with such grace, not making a single sound as his feet landed on dry leaves.\n\nTall Ben wasn't wrong, though. We were getting close. I could see the fire billowing through the trees, engulfing a building. It would do no good if Tom was dead when we found him. Can't question a dead person. Well... I guess I just did, but Barrow was a unique case. \"Hey, is that why your name is Barrow?\"\n\nBarrow glanced at me. \"What?\"\n\n\"Because you died. You know, Barrow.\"\n\n\"No, that is just my name.\"\n\nHuh. Odd coincidence. As we got closer, I was able to see that there was more than one building in the clearing. It looked like a school of some sort. Maybe an old church? I am not sure. We came to the tree line and weighed our options, trying to come up with a plan. If we went in, would that force Tom to leave? Or did entering buildings just extend the protection to the building? That wouldn't be good because we *needed* Tom.\n\n\"Well then one of us has to stay outside.\" Barrow stated. \"They will be safe. Since we will be in a building, we won't have to worry about Tall Ben. We're all smart enough not to fall for his tricks.\"\n\n\"But there is more than Tall Ben out there. Who knows what is inside, living with Tom. Who knows what Tom can do. What if he takes a picture of us?\"\n\n\"He has, plenty of times. It has never had any effect on any males.\"\n\n\"I'll stay outside.\"\n\nI looked at John and saw Tall Ben on the opposite tree line, giving me a thumbs up as if he were part of the team. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I'm not risking anything. If you think about it, I am getting the best deal. I'll be safe with the necklace.\"\n\nThat was true. \"Then you stay. Barrow and I will go in and find Tom.\"\n\nIt was decided. The main building was long and 'L' shaped, we approached the end of the shorter end which were the main doors. A sign over the door titled it 'Fourth Society of the Empty Eye.' So it was a cult of some kind, I guess. The handle turned and the door opened freely, squeeking to announce our arrival.\n\nI handed the necklace and gem to John, which lit up his jacket with blue light. \"If something goes wrong, call for us.\"\n\n\"I should be saying that to you.\" John placed the jewelry around his neck. \"Hey, we haven't spoken much. I've been... quiet ever since my brother got taken. You're a good guy, I think. When we get back, we should talk more.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I nodded. \"Humans got to stick together, right?\" I nudged Barrow, who shrugged at the joke. \"Come on, you saying you can't even laugh?\"\n\n\"No, I can.\" He slipped through the door. John's eyes were on Tall Ben, who stood clearly in the treeline, lit by the fire that burned a storage building. \"I work in the kitchen so I don't see much of him. Haven't even heard him speak until today. God, he is tall\" .\n\nI gave him one last reassuring nod before I followed after Barrow. No more protection, down one man. I keep calling this journey a plan, but we were all playing it step by step. There were plenty of windows lining both sides of the entry hall, which was incredibly short. I am average height, about five-eight, and my head nearly brushed the ceiling. It opened up as we went on, but not by much. Whoever built the structure must have been rushed or had a tiny budget to make it so short.\n\nA kid ran past me. They were so fast that I barely noticed them. Silent footsteps carried them into a room on our right, then two more kids dashed after them with playful laughter. I glanced at Barrow, who looked equally as perplexed.\n\n\"Oh, don't mind them.\"\n\nA woman stood in one of the open rooms on our left. It looked like an apartment of some kind, with an old couch and a wall-mounted tv. I could see the edge of a counter as well, possibly a kitchen. She wore a loose nightdress, one that our flashlights pierced through. She leaned on the doorframe and crossed her arms.\n\nIt was the damn spider woman again.\n\n\"No.\" I answered her before she asked.\n\nShe opened her mouth and smiled, her face a bit red. \"I didn't even ask anything.\" Her spider eyes were gone, as were her spindly legs. If I am honest, she was striking. I couldn't look away from her face. \"I'm better now. I was... cursed, I think. But look at me? Normal. Back to normal.\"\n\n\"Want me to bite her?\" Came a whisper from my jacket, one so low that only I could hear. I shook my head gently, wishing to keep Silence's presence secret. Yeah, I brought the snake. She insisted she go.\n\n\"You do look better.\" That caused her to blush, but Barrow slapped my arm. \"What? She does. She isn't spidery anymore.\"\n\nSomething crashed in her room, followed by joyous laughter. \"Quiet down, kids!\" She shook her head, a playful grin on her face. \"Past dinner time for them. I swear, I can't keep all these little ones on any schedule.\" She had something in her arms. \"This doesn't even put them to sleep anymore.\"\n\nWas that a lute? I don't really know.\n\n\"Come on, Axel.\" Barrow took a step away from the woman. \"We're wasting time.\"\n\n\"Oh? What are you guys looking for? Maybe I can help.\"\n\n\"Someone. How can you help us?\"\n\n\"The entire place has cameras. I've got lots of eyes, watching everything. I can pull them up on my computer, if you want.\"\n\n\"Axel.\" Barrow warned.\n\nI looked at him, ever the idiot. \"What? Tom might be on one of them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom. The camera creep. Is that who you are looking for?\"\n\n\"Do you know where he is?\" This entire quest just got a lot easier.\n\nShe nodded, her smile so warm. \"He has a few hiding spots! Please, I am so bored here, let me help you!\" The woman disappeared into her room and, without thinking, I stepped inside after her. Barrow was quick on my heels and tried to grab me before I went in, but I was already through the doorway. He shut the door immediately behind me as I went inside. I was focused on her, so I let him guard the door.\n\nAnd I didn't die. As promised, she was at her computer typing away. \"How do the cameras still work? The lights don't.\" Then again, her computer was on so there was power of some kind. \"Is there power?\"\n\n\"Not that kind.\" She murmured, typing away. Then I noticed that the computer *wasn't* on. The screen was black, but she was hitting the keys with a fury. I came closer to see what she was up to and only then noticed the webs. Thick silk ran from under the keyboard and up the wall, dancing into the corners and out the many holes within the room. Each key shook a different strand, all playing notes like the softest of pianos.\n\n\"My children will be back soon, they will have an answer for us.\" She turned in her chair. I've been so lonely all my life and being near her just... filled that void, I guess. Her face reddened more when I couldn't break from her eyes. \"Maybe I can play you a song while we wait?\" The lute was in her lap. \"I haven't had company in ages!\"\n\nI heard distant, muted banging. Someone's voice. But I really didn't want to offend the woman, she was so kind to me already. \"Sure, why not? Tom can wait a moment.\"\n\nShe invited me to sit on the couch, so I turned to Barrow and gestured for him to follow. He wasn't there. Incredibly rude, considering what this woman was doing for us. \"My friend can be insensitive at times, sorry.\"\n\n\"No trouble. It can just be you and me.\"\n\nI liked that. \"I feel so awful that I haven't asked for your name?\"\n\n\"Ramata. But you can call me Jo.\"\n\n\"Jo.\" It sounded nice. \"Well, Jo, what will you play?\"\n\nShe leaned one leg up to get comfortable. Too comfortable, considering how sheer her nightgown was. Then she plucked the strings. I cannot remember what tune she played, nor even what the notes sounded like. All I know is that it was beautiful. Not in a false way, like I only imagined it being good. No, it was truly a tune that would lull any man into a blissful sleep. The lullaby had my eyes heavy, so much so that I closed them in her presence. I was so warm inside, so comfortable, like a first date with a friend you've been waiting on for so long. Only, I just met her. She was so kind as to hold me close in an embrace, like a mother rocking to sleep an exhausted child. So great were the troubles of recent weeks that I let myself fall into that embrace, fall so deeply into sleep that perhaps, for once, I might feel rested.\n\nA thump woke me, the music stopped.\n\nI was staring at the ground, suspended in the air by something warm and soft. I couldn't move anything but my neck, upper shoulder, and feet. I was wrapped so tightly that even breathing was a chore, but I got by with the air I caught. The spider woman from the shop crawled down from the ceiling, which was *much* higher than the halls outside, and stared at the door. Her lute was on the ground, as if she had dropped it when startled.\n\n\"AXEL!\" A voice, heavily muffled, shouted from the other side of the door. A thump, thump. Someone was trying to get in. Barrow, obviously. I went in without him, he hadn't shut the door behind me! He was trying to stop me, then trying to come in after me! How was I so stupid, to fall for such a simple seduction?\n\nI didn't know if I should shout and alert Ramata that I was awake. She crept without making a noise, all the way up to the door. Her upper body was a woman, naked and covered by thick blankets of black hair. She had arms for legs, ones so thin that I barely noticed the fingers at the end. They gripped the floor so gently, thumbs grasping stands of spider silk. Eight human arms in place of spider legs and abdomen larger than her body, one that ended in a small mandible that had a thick strand of webbing.\n\nOne that led directly up to me. I was spider food.\n\n\"He's mine.\" She yelled through the door, her voice entirely unchanged. If I didn't have eyes on her, I would have thought she was truly protecting a soulmate from a threat. \"Go away, he loves me!\"\n\n\"Let him go.\" Barrow shouted. \"Or I will make a wish.\"\n\nThat got her attention. \"You have the doll?\" Then she laughed. \"No, no no. Surely not. Even if you did, you'd be a fool. Let me alone with my love, we are meant to be together!\"\n\n\"I will!\" He swore. \"Let him out!\"\n\nShe glanced up at me and saw my open eyes. Her face was still the same, so gentle and inviting. Her eyes black as night. \"You want to leave me?\"\n\nBut her spell was broken. \"Yeah. I don't want to be food.\"\n\n\"I wasn't lying, love. It is past dinner time and my children are starved. They have not eaten in so long.\"\n\nIt was then I noticed the little bodies in the room. Some still looked like children, but others were in the same form as the woman. Long, thin arms ending in horrifying, tiny hands. Some skittered about when spotted, little fingers carrying them up the walls and into the ceiling.\n\n\"I... I will let you go, but they will go hungry. My children...\" She sobbed. \"They always go hungry.\"\n\nAs promised, she got me down. She tore away at the silk with her normal arms, breaking it away as if it weren't stronger than any kind of glue. Then I was on the ground, little strands of spider webs dancing about, stuck to my face and clothes.\n\n\"Go to your friend before starvation outweighs my desire to live.\"\n\nI obeyed and opened the door. It wasn't locked from my end. Barrow held an old doll in his hands, one made of cloth with little button eyes. He looked entirely indifferent at my survival, but still pulled me out of the room. For once, I was thankful for his apathy because it spared me the scolding I was due. He tucked the doll into his jacket and drew a deep breath.\n\n\"No more distractions, you wasted a lot of time in there.\"\n\n\"I almost died.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you did.\"\n\nWe pushed on. The cold was even more unforgiving now that I was warmed from the spider's trap. It had been very comfortable there, were my life not at stake. Tall Ben watched us from the windows, appearing oddly short. He was just a little taller than me, actually. When I made eye contact, he waved and put a finger to his lips as if he were sneaking about with us. Did he actually think we were friends, or was this some odd trap? He killed Keith, not me. That was not *us*. Finally we got to a place without windows, where stairs led downwards into some kind of basement. There was laughter down there. Creepy laughter, clearly from a man.\n\nBarrow and I began our descent. There was light down there, coming from a room down one of the long halls. The staircase ended at a crossroads of three halls; the laughter and light came from the left. I could see a door that was cracked open, a dull bulb let enough into the hall that we could turn off our flashlights.\n\nWe approached the door to hear a one-sided conversation. When I was close enough to look inside, I saw the bald head of Tom standing near a large mirror. \"You just have one of those voices where you say something and everyone turns their head.\" Was he talking to himself? \"I mean it!\" More of his laughing. \"You are my sunshine in the morning, even on a cloudy day! You have such a bright smile, you just light up the room!\"\n\nHe laughed away and turned slightly, a genuine smile wide upon his face. I got a look at the mirror and saw Em, just as she had been before he took a picture. She leaned against furniture in the mirror, awkwardly waiting for whatever Tom had to say next.\n\n\"We should eat together, like a date. We don't have to call it that, though. Obviously we are just friends. For now, that is.\" More laughing. I hated that laugh. \"There are too many guys working at the café these days. You're outnumbered! You should ask Richard about that. People love pretty faces.\"\n\nHe lifted his head when she didn't say anything. \"You look really uncomfortable. That whole thing that happened with your leg? I can't imagine how you feel.\" Tom put some plates on the counter. \"I got rear ended a few days ago getting some groceries. I am still pretty upset, it bent up a perfectly good car.\n\n\"I think we could both use a hug.\" He began moving in the direction she was standing in the mirror so that his reflection approached her. \"I could really use a hug, Em.\"\n\nYeah, that was enough waiting. Barrow and I stepped inside, which startled Tom. \"W-what are... how did you?\"\n\n\"Let her go.\" I demanded. \"Let her go right now!\"\n\n\"She wants to be here! We're friends! We've been talking for *days*!\" Em began crying hysterically upon seeing her rescue. \"Aren't we friends? Don't we have something?!\"\n\nShe shook her head, full of rage. \"No! No we aren't! I want out!\"\n\n\"You said-\"\n\n\"So you wouldn't hurt me!\"\n\nTom swallowed, then lost his smile. \"I won't let her out. I can't, it isn't something I can do. So just let her be happy here and go on your way. I can take care of her, you know. I love her.\"\n\n\"Let her out.\" Barrow echoed my command. \"There has to be a way.\"\n\n\"There isn't. She's dead, okay! I just have her spirit here so she doesn't move on! Your friend died and I saved her!\"\n\n\"She died because you stole her!\" I shouted. There was a lamp nearby, one of three in the small apartment. I lifted it over his head. \"YOU!\"\n\n\"And you'll finish the job? You can't let her out! You can't, otherwise she will be fully dead!\"\n\nThere had to be a way. Laura was a ghost, one that left her body and possessed a fly instead. There *had* to be a way to do the same thing. \"You moved her from the camera to the mirror! How did you do that?!\" The lamp was ready to fall on his head. I wanted to hurt him. \"How?!\"\n\n\"Tell us or I will break it.\" Barrow threatened. He had the camera in his hands. \"I will.\"\n\n\"No, don't!\" Finally, Tom sounded afraid. \"Don't break it! I swear, I promise on my own life and any god, I cannot put her back!\"\n\nFor a moment, Barrow only stared at Tom. Then he lowered his arm, about to set the camera down. \"You are certain?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. I moved her to the mirror by sticking her photo to the back of it. A mirror is just an image, after all! That won't work on bodies. I have... I have tried.\"\n\n\"Then we have no need of this.\" He slammed the camera onto the table, shattering the lens. Snapping plastic, exposing electronic parts within. Then he crushed it again, before Tom could cry out in pain.\n\n\"Please, please! That is my only-\" Smash, smash. Tom began to weep. \"My camera...\"\n\n\"It is okay, Tommy.\" A woman's voice, one that was so soft and gentle. \"It'll be okay.\"\n\n\"No, no it won't. I can't just buy another one.\"\n\nRamata crossed her arms and leaned against the doorframe. \"If you need someone to talk to, you can come to my room. We can sit on my bed and talk about whatever you want.\" That smile, so overwhelming. \"Come on. You don't need that camera to make friends.\"\n\n\"I... I suppose we can talk.\" He looked at Barrow and I. \"I certainly don't enjoy this company.\" We did not stop him as he pushed past us.\n\n\"Upstairs. On your right, towards the front door. Second to last.\" She called after him as he hurried towards her apartment. \"He will do. Much more fat than you, my love. Tom has been a meal out of my reach for so long, that camera has captured many of my daughters throughout the years. My sons are much too small to harm him. Thank you.\n\n\"And, Axel?\" She smiled. \"Promise I won't eat you next time.\" Then she left, following Tom. \"Wait up! I need to make dinner!\"\n\nEm was standing close to the mirror, her eyes red and face stained. \"I didn't think anyone was coming. He kept trying to... trying to...\"\n\n\"Its okay.\" Barrow stopped her. \"We are going to get you out of there.\"\n\n\"How?\" I asked.\n\nHe hesitated. \"We can take the mirror to the shop and ask Selene. She must know something.\"\n\n\"And if it breaks on the way?\"\n\nBarrow moved his jaw as he thought. \"I can't risk that. She'd be gone.\" He stared off at nothing, as if he had a plan that he hated more than anything. \"There is... one way.\" Then he fished the doll back out of his jacket. \"One way.\"\n\n\"No, Barrow. There has to be something else.\"\n\n\"There isn't.\"\n\n\"There must be!\"\n\n\"What is that?\" I was in the dark. \"I am confused.\"\n\nBarrow gripped it tight, then looked up at me. \"It is a curse. My curse.\" He looked back down, resisting the urge to tear it apart. \"It grants wishes, but at a terrible price.\"\n\n\"But we can wish her back into her body?\"\n\n\"Not we.\" Barrow placed the doll on the kitchen's counter. \"You.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nIn silence, Barrow stared at the cloth toy. \"I made a... loophole. It is cursed to be at my side for all eternity, begging for another wish to be made. Torturing me at all hours until I make my next wish.\" Unlimited wishes didn't sound bad. \"But it hurts people. The wishes are not good. I could wish for a friend, only to have someone's entire family die so that I was the only one left for them to speak to. It is an evil thing. A curse.\"\n\nHe held it out to me. \"One that I must pass to you, if you want her free.\"\n\nI didn't want a curse. \"Why can't you make the wish?\"\n\n\"I made a wish to trick it. I can't make any more wishes with it. It was a bluff I made with the spider.\" Again, he held it out. \"But it is stuck to me until someone else asks for it. Only then can I give it away. I have to grant your wish.\"\n\n\"But I will be cursed?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It isn't pretty.\"\n\n\"But it can be tricked?\"\n\n\"It only begs for another wish when the previous one is granted. Find a wish it cannot grant and it will be stuck forever.\"\n\n\"And what did you wish?\"\n\nBarrow stared at the doll. \"I wouldn't tell, otherwise you may try to do the same thing.\"\n\n\"Why don't we just destroy it afterwards?\"\n\n\"Because it comes back. It is a part of you once you make your first wish. It cannot leave, not even if you die.\"\n\nI looked at Em, who was waiting in the mirror. She wanted out, but she did try to enslave me. Why would I encumber myself with a curse for her sake? Em saw that look in my eye and let out a long breath. \"Don't do it, Axel. Don't. I've seen what it does to Barrow, but he can't feel. You can. It isn't worth it.\"\n\nShe wasn't worth it? No. Selene said I had a good heart and that the forest would try to eat it. I wasn't going to let it. \"It was your father that made you do it, I know that. I know you don't want to hurt people. I... forgive you.\"\n\nMore tears. Em covered her mouth and looked away, which is when Silence decided to make her appearance. She slivered out of my jacket so that her head was showing. \"And I don't even remember what you did to me. But if it gets us out of here, then I forgive you too.\" Then she looked up at me. \"But not you. You almost got us eaten.\"\n\n\"I didn't make you come.\"\n\n\"You brought the snake?\" Barrow asked.\n\n\"You found the snake?\" Em was entirely surprised.\n\n\"Her name is Silence. And yes to both of you, obviously.\" It took strength, what came next. I had to work myself up to it, override my survival instincts that told me it was a terrible idea, what I was about to do. \"Em, I forgive you, and you do not owe me for this.\" Then I turned to Barrow. \"I wish that doll was mine.\"\n\nEm slammed her fists on the glass. \"NO!\"\n\nWhen the doll entered my hands, it was warm. Very warm. It started to burn, so I put it down. My hands felt like fire even when it was gone. \"What is going on?\" I backed up. Pain. Random pricks all throughout my body, inside me, in my head. \"What do I do?!\"\n\n\"Make the next wish!\"\n\n\"What do you want, Axel?\" The doll whispered. \"Anything at all. Make a wish.\"\n\n\"Put Em back in her body!\"\n\n\"Done.\" The pain vanished, Em was no longer in the mirror. \"Next?\"\n\nI started heating up again. \"Make her well! Healthy, like she was before Tom came!\"\n\n\"Done.\"\n\nAgain, the heat reset but started climbing.\n\n\"Think of something that will take a long time. Something it can't do, something impossible!\"\n\n\"Break my deal with Rykar.\"\n\nBarrow shook his head. \"That won't work! You can't wish to undo a wish!\"\n\n\"What is the Pillar King?!\"\n\nIt hesitated as the heat vanished. \"King of Flesh, the Eye of Gold. The Leader of All Men. Next?\"\n\n\"The more wishes you make the slower the fire comes!\"\n\nI'd have to make a lot, it was coming back fast. \"What is the Eye of Gold?!\"\n\nAgain, it took a second, as if it did not enjoy the question. \"The Witness of Flesh, one of many Watchers.\"\n\nThere had to be something that it couldn't do. \"Show me!\"\n\n\"What?\" It asked.\n\nBarrow titled his head. \"It's never done that before.\"\n\n\"Show me the Golden Eye!\"\n\n\"Done.\"\n\nThe room vanished and I was in a field. The grass was up to my knees, greener than any I had ever seen. Above me was an expanse of black sky that went on for eternity, covered in stars that seemed to breathe with life of their own. Then, from the deepest part of the sky, came a brilliant golden light. It was clothed in storm clouds that swirled about it, like a hurricane only larger than the world itself. The golden light became a colossal eye, dismembered from a body. As it came closer, I saw that the gold was infected by a deep red, coating half the eye in crimson. The pupil watched closely, curiously, and then it stopped approaching.\n\nThe winds of its storm were so distant, and the ocre-red lightning within thundered so loudly that I could hear it from an impossible distance.\n\n\"It is seen.\" The doll began pulling me back to the room.\n\n\"Speak to it. I wish you would say something to the eye.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You can refuse a wish?\"\n\n\"Your wish cannot force me to speak to another.\"\n\nIt was getting hotter. \"I wish to stay until I say otherwise.\" The scene solidified again. \"What should I call this god? I wish to know what is proper.\"\n\n\"The God of Ocre. The Gardener.\"\n\nAgain, the heat reset. I stepped forward. \"Oh Gardener! You are the Witness of Flesh! Will you accept a sacrifice?!\" I shouted, assuming it was far too distant to hear me.\n\nBlack tendrils approached the ground, like tornadoes from a great storm. Bloody flesh fell from the sky in shapes that resembled creatures. They struck the ground and gurgled, trying to breathe with their malformed lungs. Gross.\n\nSomething that looked like a large man landed near me. Its stomach was a mouth. \"What would you offer, o' Fatewriter?\"\n\n\"This doll.\" I held out the cursed toy.\n\n\"This is not a gift, Fatewriter. Give to me a promise, and I will take this thing from you.\"\n\nThe mouth was so wet when it spoke, as if it hungered for my flesh. \"What promise?\"\n\n\"Sweet things, Fatewriter. Whisper to me sweet promises of what you will do for me, and I shall take this burden from thy flesh and spirit. For I am the Gardener, the Eye of Gold and Crimson. The flesh and spirit are mine to witness.\"\n\nThe eyeless woman told me to write. \"I will write.\"\n\n\"So sweet.\" The mouth smacked. \"But what shall ye write?\"\n\n\"What would you have me write?\"\n\n\"Mmm. Of the world you see, in your dreams. It is a true one. Speak kindly, and say you will write.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"The taste of your words are pleasant, o' Fatewriter. I shall have this thing you have brought.\" The doll began to burn, but I could no longer hear it. \"So sweet are its screams. Ah, it is so good on my ears. I would hear more of this. Goodbye, Fatewriter.\"\n\nWith impossible speed, the eye vanished into the dark sky. The fleshy things remained, groping about on the ground and eating the grass as if starved of any nutrients. I only remained for a moment before I too was taken away, back into Tom's room. I stood with Barrow, my hands empty. The counter was empty too; the doll was gone.\n\n\"What... what did you do?\"\n\nI was making way too many deals lately. \"I got rid of the doll.\"\n\n\"How?!\"\n\n\"I asked a higher power.\"\n\n\"Huh.\" He shrugged, indifferent. \"I guess we can leave.\"\n\nThinking it was over since Em was saved, we went to the door all too casually. When we stepped past Ramata's door, we heard sucking sounds. I guess Tom was being drained. Ew. John was at the door, inside the building. That should have driven the cryptids away. As we got closer, he lifted his hands to reveal the dim necklace and gem.\n\n\"Guess it didn't last long.\" He shrugged, handing the necklace and gem to Barrow. \"Good thing Tall Ben can't get in, right?\"\n\nOnly, he left the door open. A slightly taller person than me, maybe six-two, swung open the outward rotating door. \"The building is on fire, get out!\"\n\nIt was Tall Ben, I knew the voice, but John wasn't used to it. In a panic to not be burned alive, he obeyed instantly. The moment his arm left the doorway, he was snatched by the wrist. As Tall Ben stepped backwards, he got taller and taller.\n\n\"This guy and I are going back to my place. Now, are you two going to be good friends and come with?\"\n\nBarrow leaned over. \"He will kill us all.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Is it bad that I wish you still had the doll?\"\n\n\"Careful.\" I replied, worried it might come back. \"Let him go, Ben. Please. You already got meat.\"\n\n\"Don't need meat. I need a friend.\" He stared a moment longer, but I had nothing. \"Very well. Let's go, fella. I've got some games we can play.\"\n\nQuicker than I could blink, Tall Ben was vanishing into the trees. I heard John cry out to his brother, but he did not say his last name.\n\n\"Dan! DAN!\" The young man cried out. \"DAN!\"\n\nAnd suddenly Dan was there, at the treeline, watching Tall Ben take his little brother away.\n\n\"I'll take your place!\" John's distant scream echoed. \"I'll take your place!!\"\n\nWith that, his cries went quiet. Dan turned to face us, only his eyes were no longer yellow. He was... normal. Tall Ben appeared once more, grabbing him by the waste. \"NO MORE TRICKS!\" He roared, waving him at us. Dan screamed., but Tall Ben reached the height of the trees. What could we do? \"COME OUTSIDE!\"\n\nI couldn't let the forest eat me. I had to do something, so I took a chance and stepped out the door. Maybe Ben was a friend, maybe he could be reasoned with.\n\nThere was no time to react. He reached to grab me so fast that I could not have cried out before his fingers gripped my leg. Only, he did not pull me into the air. Instead, he dropped Dan and cried out. Tall Ben covered his eyes, screaming in pain, before tumbling away into the night.\n\n\"Now how do you expect to hold your end of the deal if you are dead?\" Rykar tsked. \"Try to get yourself killed again, and you're mine. Right now, you are more useful alive.\" He glanced at the sky. \"But I do like a good race. You are stressed for time. I think dawn is soon.\"\n\nHow had so much time gone by? Was I *really* in the spider's room for *that* long?! \"We have to go!\" I yelled at Dan, helping him to his feet. Barrow followed after me as we raced the daylight.\n\n\"Thanks for the trade, Dan. I'm excited to work with your little brother!\" He laughed as we ran away, not having any time to entertain his taunts.\n\nThe sun lit up the sky, coming closer and closer to the trees as we dodged bush and branch. I almost hit a tree, tripped up, but recovered quickly. We were down to seconds, I couldn't afford to fall. Fire in my legs, worse than what the doll delivered. My lungs burned, my head throbbed, and my throat did not agree with the frigid air I breathed in. But I moved faster, I had to move faster, the sun was starting to touch the top of the trees!\n\nThen the shop came into sight. It was snowing lightly when I saw that beautiful café. We were safe. But the windows were shattered, a door hung loosely by a single hinge and the other was nowhere to be seen. Selene stepped out and hurried over, quickly noting John's absence.\n\n\"Where is Kitchen Boi?\"\n\nI was suddenly thankful that Selene didn't use real names. \"Gone. He's gone.\"\n\n\"DeGuire?\"\n\n“Whoa whoa!” Barrow put up his hands. “He’s back!”\n\n“Oh!” Selene covered her mouth. “Your name is yours, Dan DeGuire. I do not own it. People have to stop introducing themselves to me when we meet.”\n\n“That is how meeting people works.”\n\n“How’d you get him back?”\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but I was gone. Everything was black. Had I passed out?\n\nSuddenly I was back in the field. The grass was so soft. Above me, the eye was gone but the fleshy things still labored along. They wandered aimlessly, looking for anything to feed their bellies. Well, some of them didn't have bellies. They wanted food, I think. That assumption came when I felt teeth sink into my lower leg, gnawing at my ankle. Digging deep, all the way to the bone. I tried to kick it off, but another leapt and grabbed my side. I could feel my flesh being stripped away, slurped down the throat of an abomination. I screamed, but there was no one to hear me. I was only food, meat and bone, and I would be satiate the same.\n\nThen, as suddenly as I left, I was back in the parking lot of the café. Blood poured from my wounds and Selene was calling an ambulance. I couldn't stay conscious, not with that much blood on the ground. Sleep found me, so I rested.\n\nAnd that is it so far. I recovered, but my right foot is super messed up. It took a few days to get back to health, I was nearly dead from blood loss when they got me to the hospital. Now I am back on the floor, wondering if the new DeGuire was out there. If he was being tortured by Rykar, if it would have been best to let Tall Ben have him.\n\nAlso, why did I go back to the plane of The Gardener? I don’t have a doll to give me answers. Maybe Selene knows.\n\nBut that is not a decision I can make. I can't go back. I've made so many deals in the last few days, I don't know who I owe what. So, if you meet a devil, find a special doll, or are visited by an eldritch God of Flesh, do me a favor; don't make any deals, just go on your way. They are more trouble then they are worth.\n\nOh, and Merry Christmas. Happy New Year too. I hope yours was better than mine.",

        "text": "  \n\n**Abandoned**\n\n“Derek, what I would like to do now is focus on the events leading up to your most recent memory; if this is okay with you?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Sure, start anywhere?” (Derek)\n\n“A few months prior should suffice, but for the sake of time let’s mainly focus on specific things or events if you can, such as an activity or an interaction with your family or peers.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek takes a moment to think of a good place to begin.* \n\n“Ok, well it’s June, school is out and I am doing what kids normally do when they’re not stuck in a classroom.” (Derek) \n\n“Play outside?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Exactly. I’m riding my bike back home from a friend’s house when I see my mom’s car leaving from our apartment complex. There was a note stuck to the fridge saying that she took Greg driving and that they would be back later with ice cream.” (Derek)\n\n“He had gotten his Learner’s Permit a few weeks before school had ended, so like any fifteen year old the only thing he wanted to do is cruise around, even if mom was right beside him. Every night, he begged her to take him driving, and as always she gave in. His driving wasn’t half bad, and occasionally I got to tag along, but not this time. I really didn’t care; besides, ice cream was on the way.” (Derek)\n\n“When several hours went by and they hadn’t returned, I sent a text to both of them but they didn’t respond back. By then the sun had already set, the street lights flickered on, and the hour on my phone read 8pm. I then scrolled down to mom’s number and called it, no answer; did the same with Greg, no answer.’ (Derek)\n\n“By sun down, I must have called at least a dozen times. At this point, I started to freak out, and as a twelve year old it’s worse because you really don’t know how to process things like this in a rational manner. Every time a pair of head lamps ran along the living room wall I’d rush to the window to see if it was them.” (Derek)\n\n“I can imagine just how terrifying that would be for not only a child but even an adult. In such a scenario, pragmatic theories aim to temper our darkest allusions until ultimately we succumb to a more primal line of thinking.” (Dr. Crane) \n\n“That so true. I kept thinking about my dad’s disappearance, and what if they disappeared too. Weary from crying, I curled up on the couch and turned on the tv. They’ll be home soon.’ “I told myself before falling asleep. A while later I woke up and checked my phone, no calls or texts. Finally I had enough and dialed 911, but just as I was about to push call, the door opens; they returned home.” (Derek)\n\n“Mom enters first followed by Greg who was carrying a burlap sack, and just as I was about to lay into them in walks grandma with a smile running from ear to ear. I couldn’t help but notice that she was holding a plastic bag from Miller’s Grocery store.’ (Derek)\n\n“Apparently they’d driven all the way out to her house and brought her back as a surprise. At first I was upset, really upset, but both mom and grandma hugged me and apologized. As they were getting settled, I dashed into the kitchen, grabbed a dish and spoon and served myself a hefty portion of ice cream. Nothing soothes like a creamy bowl of vanilla bean ice cream. After finishing, I rinsed out my bowl and placed it in the sink and then went into the bathroom to brush my teeth.’ (Derek)\n\n“Not five minutes later was there a knock at the door. At first I thought it was Greg, but he doesn’t knock, he pounds. This knock was odd; it was slow and monotone and slightly chilling. After turning off the faucet I then cracked open the door, and standing on the other side was grandma.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Oh, hi grandma.’ I said.” (Derek)\n\n“I couldn’t figure out what she wanted except maybe to say goodnight? But the expression on her face or should I say the lack of expression told me something different.” (Derek)\n\n“’Grandma what’s…’” (Derek)\n\n“Before I could finish she brought around the ice cream container from behind her with the lid removed.” (Derek)\n\n“Did you ask if you could have any?” (Granny)\n\n“Ah, no, but mom said that she was going out for ice cream.” (Derek)\n\n“Not this close to bedtime. Come into the kitchen when you’re done.” (Grandma) \n\n“She then walked away. I stood there confused. What was the big deal? Oh wow, so I ate some ice cream later than I should have, but in my defense they got home late. I mean it’s not like I set the house on fire or robbed a convenience store. Whatever, anyway I mulled over my choices: either ignore her and go straight to bed, or go into the kitchen and find out what she wants. Of course, I chose the latter. Waiting for me in the kitchen was grandma with a red bottle in one hand and a cup in the other.” (Derek)\n\n“What’s going on?” I asked. (Derek)\n\n“What’s going on is a punishment. You know the rules, no sweets before bed.” (Granny)\n\n“But grandma its summer; what’s the big deal?” (Derek)\n\n“I’m not going to argue with you.” (Grandma) \n\n“She then unseals the small bottle, removes the cap and begins pouring the contents into the cup, filling it half way. It had one of those colorful labels with a laughing devil rising from a mushroom cloud, yeah no way.” (Derek)\n\n“Hot sauce? I’m not drinking that!” (Derek)\n\n“You will.” (Granny)\n\n“I didn’t recognize the bottle as one of ours. Did she seriously bring it from her house? Straight nonsense and I was determined to end this shit here and now.” (Derek) \n\n“‘Mom, mom, mom!’ I called out.” (Derek)\n\n“Then a door slammed shut. I leaned back to look down the hallway and noticed that her door was closed. When I faced forward again I saw grandma’s yellow dentures peering back at me from behind a mocking grin.” (Derek)\n\n“‘You can’t make me.’ I said in defiance.” (Derek)\n\n“No you’re right about that, I can’t. Oh Greg!” (Mother)\n\n“She called to my brother.” (Derek)\n\n“Oh, Greg!” (Granny) \n\n“On the second time she seemed to sing his name. So now in walks the jerk.” (Derek)\n\n“What’s going on?” (Greg)\n\n“Your little brother broke a rule and is now disobeying me. Can I get your help with this matter?” (Granny)\n\n“Greg sneers at me.” (Derek)\n\n“Dude, why are you upsetting grandma?” (Greg)\n\n“‘I’m not, she’s upsetting me!’ I snapped at him.” (Derek)\n\n“This whole thing is crap! I just had some ice cream that’s all, and you guys left me here by myself and didn’t bother calling or texting or replying to me, so screw you I’m going to bed.” (Derek) \n\n“I started to walk away, but Greg stuck out his arm and stopped me.” (Derek)\n\n“‘No hold on, what do you need him to do?’ Greg asked her.” (Greg/Derek)\n\n“He needs to take his punishment like a good little boy and drink this. It’s not too hot but hot enough.” (Granny)\n\n“It’s just hot sauce. Stop being a wussy and drink it.” (Greg) \n\n“’You drink it! Mom, mom!’ I kept yelling.” (Derek)\n\n“Greg grabs me by the collar of my shirt and then aims his fist at my face.” (Derek)\n\n“Mom’s had a hard week so she doesn’t need a little fucker like you making it harder. Drink it or I’ll hit you!” (Greg)\n\n“Not a very nice brother.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Like I said, jerk. I’ve been on the receiving end of Greg’s punches before; he’s got a talent for making bruises last for weeks. The choice was obvious, the hot sauce. My plan was to drink it really fast and then wash it down with milk to lessen the sting.” (Derek)\n\n“I took the cup from her and downed it in three gulps, and then smiled at the both of them. Whatever peppers they used to make that sauce must have been grown in lava, because the heat was practically instantaneous and crazy hot. Franticly, I snatched a glass from the cupboard to douse the flames with milk, but as I turned back around there was grandma blocking the refrigerator door.” (Derek)\n\n“No, no milk or drink of any kind; this is a lesson, and lessons must be enforced.” (Grandma)\n\n“Sweat, snot, saliva all dripped from my face as the heat kept building. No way in hell was that Cholula or any kind of sauce meant for consumption; it was 100% napalm. It felt like a million hornets jabbing at my tongue. That’s when had I reached my threshold and rushed over to the sink and threw up. Tasting the hot sauce a second time was almost as excruciating as tasting vanilla flavored bile.” (Derek)\n\n“There, no more ice cream in the tummy. Now you can go to sleep with a clear conscious knowing that you did the right thing. Goodnight Derek; goodnight Greg see you in the morning.” (Granny)\n\n“After hearing their doors close I broke my stance and grabbed the carton of milk and began chugging, stopping only to catch my breath. Afterwards, I snatched a towel off of the counter cleaned my face with it; next to it was a receipt. There wasn’t anything particularly interesting about it, but I looked anyway.’ (Derek)\n\n“It was from Miller’s grocery store. According to the receipt there were only two items purchased that night: One gallon of vanilla ice cream and one bottle of ‘Devil’s Blood’. No one in our house, not even grandma uses anything hotter than a Tabasco sauce, so why the hell is it in our kitchen? I don’t know how long that damn bottle sat in our cabinet, but I was clever enough to replace its contents with Taco Bell sauce from all the packets I snagged. The next day is when I added motor oil to Greg’s bottle of coconut oil.” (Derek)\n\n“That’s quite harsh. Was this kind of punishment common in your household?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“No, I mean only when she was around and even then was it rare. Mom once told us that grandma was from a different era; an era when punishment was with the rod or in this case hot sauce. I suppose from that line of reasoning we learned to accept grandma’s austere ways.” (Derek)\n\n“Derek, can you give me another example of this kind of punishment?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek pauses to reflect.* \n\n“Well she has a sweet side and she has a sour side. And everyone did their best to stay on the sweet side. It was the Christmas prior to Ice Cream Gate, and while we were all seated for dinner mom accidentally tipped over the gravy dish in the kitchen. Not a big deal, right? But then I saw the panic in her eyes, a panic that wasn’t brought on by spilled gravy; she was looking right at grandma. Without a word, grandma turned back to her food and started eating. I remember the sound of her fork and knife chopping and grinding into the plate.’ (Derek)\n\n“Greg and I offered to help mom clean it up but grandma told us to sit back down and finish our supper. After cleaning up the mess, mom looked over at grandma as if to get approval to return to the dinner table in her own damn house. Grandma nodded, but then when mom went to sit down, grandma took away her chair and made her stand the entire time. Actually she told Greg to do it, I guess to further humiliate her, bitch.’ (Derek)\n\n“I think that mom had it rough growing up; grandma was probably very strict with her when she was a younger, but I don’t care what era a person is born in, you don’t do shit like that.” (Derek)\n\n“Was there any other incidence that you can recall where she acted inappropriately?” (Crane)\n\n“Yeah. So one night while mom and grandma were in the kitchen making dinner I was going to the bathroom. Then mom knocks on the door and tells me to take a shower before supper. Now I hadn’t showered in three or four days and was a little ripe even by my standards, but I did what normal kids do when they wanna do things their own way, I argued. And of course grandma had to stick her nose into it. So here she comes storming into the bathroom, all wide eyed with hands covered in blood from cutting up the steak meat. Mom stopped in midsentence, lowered her head and moved aside like an obedient child. And that’s another thing, whenever grandma got mad, mom’s demeanor would completely change.” (Derek)\n\n“Sort of like the gravy incident at Christmas?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Pretty much.” (Derek)\n\n“Mom did as grandma said, but that was the thing, mom acted differently around her, more dutiful, more servile. She would hardly pay any attention to me or Greg unless grandma brought us up in conversation forcing her to address us. But, during the year of my last memories, she had been more talkative to Greg.” (Derek)\n\n“I once saw grandma sitting in her recliner crocheting and slowly swaying her head back and forth as if there were a church choir singing her favorite hymn while mom sat in a chair next to her with hands folded in her lap, doing nothing. She just sat there like an android poised to accept whatever directive my beloved grandmother would give her.” (Derek)\n\n“How unusual.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah, tell me about it. She calls mom “Birdie”. ‘She’s my little trained birdie.’ Grandma would say.” (Derek)\n\n“It sounds as though your mother fears confrontation which would explain the absence of resolution when these issues arise.” (Dr. Crane) \n\n“I guess, but somehow she seemed to find her grit whenever I got out of line. Anyway, back to the story. So there’s grandma with a bloody knife in her hand and a scowl on her face; needless to say it was really uncomfortable.” (Derek)\n\n“Do you think that she would have harmed you?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Oh no, but still it was kind of scary. I braced myself for a tirade, but that didn’t happen.” (Derek)\n\n“No? What did happen?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“First, mom went back into the kitchen. Then grandma made sure there was complete silence in the room. And when there was, she said in a sickly sweet voice, ‘Do you need grandma to give you a bath, or would you prefer Greg to do it?’” (Derek/Grandma)\n\n*Dr. Crane sneers with distain.*\n\n“My blood nearly froze solid. I don’t know what was more disturbing, what was said, or how she said it? I mean I couldn’t tell whether she was serious or just kidding around, but the thought of either of them washing me was repulsive. And considering what had happened the month before with the sick kiss and the ice cream drama, I thought it best to keep my mouth shut and start the shower.’ (Derek)\n\n“I faced away from grandma and waited for her to get the hell out as steamed poured from behind the curtain. I then removed my shirt and was about to fully undress until I felt a cool draft on my back. ‘Please let her be gone!’ I told myself, but she wasn’t. She was still standing there, watching me like some fascist sentinel ensuring my compliance. The glare I gave her was, *get the fuck out!*’ (Derek)\n\n“But I was afraid; afraid that she might call Greg or something. So I grabbed a towel and wrapped it around my waist, turned back to face the shower, removed the rest of my clothes and got in so fast that I damn near slipped and fell. For the next minute or so I let the hot water pour down on my head to help wash away the storm of emotions that I was feeling.” (Derek)\n\n“I start thinking about school, which was not for a couple more months. Soon I’d be a seventh grader, and unlike most kids, I really didn’t mind it. I mean homework was boring, but Brandy, Brandy and her amazing blue eyes. I had a crush on her since the fourth grade. Aside from her obvious beauty, it was her smile that I fell in love with but never had the courage to ask if she wanted to hang out sometime. Right then and there I decided that this was going to be the year that I’d ask her out.’ (Derek)\n\n“Then as I lean back to rinse the shampoo from my hair, I feel a pair of hands lightly brush up against the back of my leg. I freaked out and screamed ‘What the fuck!’ Crouched down was grandma with that creepy ass grin, washing the blood from her goddamn hands.\n\n“Good boy.” (Grandma)\n\n“She whispered before pulling her head out.” (Derek)\n\n“I didn’t move an inch for the remainder of that shower. I just stood there and let the water hit me until it turned cold. My body shivered uncontrollably, not from the icy water, but from shock. The whole time I kept thinking *what if she’s still in the bathroom, standing there when I get out? What if Greg’s there?*” (Derek)\n\n“How awful. I’m sorry to hear that. Was she still there?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“No, thankfully.” (Derek)\n\n**The Farm**\n\n“You’re doing good Derek, we are making progress, and remember, if at any point that you need to take a break for any reason let me know.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah, I will.” (Derek)\n\n“Okay, now let’s fast forward to the day of your last memory and walk me through it.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Alright, well it was September, no wait, October, yeah October because it was a month after my twelfth birthday and I remember how bare the trees looked as we made our way to grandma’s house which is about an hour long drive through cornfields and cow pastures. Before I was born, my grandpa would farm the land, raising dairy cows and harvesting corn, but now all that’s left of it are two dilapidated barns and the ruins of an old silo.’ (Derek) \n\n“The road dips into a wooded area where pavement becomes gravel and street lamps are nowhere to be found. As we drove around the last bend, there was a shocking sight. Hanging from the limb of a large tree were three animals whose undersides were a gaping cavity dripping with blood. Beneath them the earth was dark and stained like a red shadow. Both my aunt and uncle are avid hunters and live just down the road from grandma, but deer season was not for another month; I guess they decided to get an early start? Anyway, venison’s good, especially when it’s wrapped in bacon, but seeing their limp bodies sway eerily in the wind did nothing for my appetite.’ (Derek)\n\n“The odd thing was, was that only two of them were deer, a couple of whitetail. The other was way smaller with black fur and missing its head.” (Derek)\n\n“That is somewhat unsettling.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah tell me about it. The road ends next a detached garage where we parked the car and walked down to the house. From the front, it looks like a single story home but from behind the basement floor is exposed and faces a large grassy hill. Standing on the porch is grandma who welcomes us with a pitcher of homemade apple cider. She offered Greg pineapple juice instead, because he’s a picky fucker like that. Why he liked it so much was beyond me, too tart, but he went inside while I took my glass of cider and walked down around the back of the house and watched the goats feeding in their pen.’ (Derek)\n\n“They weren’t livestock, more like her pets, and she had five of them and each had a name: Stumpy, because it was born with no hoof on one of its front legs; another she called Pig Goat or Piggy, because of his pot belly; Wally; Sally; and the Kid, who was a massive goat of the Boer breed. His was a rare sort, not sure where grandma got him; he had black fur which is unusual for their kind. But I only counted four goats in the pen; Kid was nowhere to be seen.” (Derek)\n\n“Derek!” (Uncle)\n\n“Barked a gruff voice that startled me. I turned around so fast that I spilt half of my drink.” (Derek)\n\n“Didn’t mean to scare you.” (Uncle)\n\n“My uncle said while laughing.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Nah, whatcha got in the bag.’ I asked him.” (Derek) \n\n“Just some clothes for the washer.” (Uncle)\n\n“Hunting clothes?” (Derek)\n\n“Yeah, mostly deer.” (Uncle)\n\n“Mostly deer?” (Derek)\n\n“And some goat.” (Uncle)\n\n“Goat?” (Derek)\n\n“Yeah. We found Kid dead this morning. I’m guessing you saw him when you came in. I meant to have him down before you guys got here.” (Uncle)\n\n“How did he die?” (Derek)\n\n“You know how Kid was, he never was one to behave himself and stay put in the pen like the others; well this time he wondered onto the road and I struck him with the truck. Don’t know how I could have missed seeing the old ox, messed up my bumper and grill pretty good. I’m sorry Derek; I know he was your favorite. You’re not upset with me are you?” (Uncle) \n\n“No.” I said just before he entered through the basement door. But I wasn’t being completely honest; in truth I was a little mad. But he was right, everyone knew how the Kid loved to escape and go foraging around for fresh grass, so I really couldn’t fault my uncle for it. \n\nAnyway, I went back for more cider, and after two or three glasses, my bladder was ready to burst, and the only bathroom in the house is the one downstairs, so if it was occupied then Derek would’ve found the nearest tree.” (Derek)\n\n“The basement floor had a black and white checker design that I thought was kinda cool; it reminded me of a picture that I had seen in a book of a medieval royal court. After leaving the bathroom, I had a sudden craving for an ice cream sandwich. But I didn’t have to go upstairs into the kitchen to get one; grandma had an enormous freezer in the other room just on the other side of the stairs. I lifted up the massive lid and waited for the rush of icy mist to dissipate. As the cold settles, I begin to see the top of something black; it’s the bag that my uncle was carrying earlier. I asked myself, “Why would put a bag of dirty laundry be in the freezer?’ (Derek)\n\n“Not only was it oddly shaped but the textures varied: some squishy, some hard as a rock. And it was sticky too. I had to know what it was. The top was bound in twine and too difficult to undo with just one free hand, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me. The damn plastic must have been construction grade because it took real effort to tear a small hole in it. I still couldn’t tell what it was, so I ripped a little more and stood on the tips on my toes to get a better look. I remember thinking, *what the hell is that?*’ (Derek)\n\n“Suddenly I jerked upwards and lost my footing and fell forward into the freezer, dangling half in and out with my face pressed up against the bag. Quickly, I pushed myself out and fell backwards onto the floor.” (Derek)\n\n“What was in the bag?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I don’t know, I mean I don’t remember.” (Derek)\n\n“But looking down at my hands I then realized why the bag was sticky; they were covered in blood. I jumped to my feet and ran into the bathroom to wash up. It was a good thing I happen to glance in the mirror because there was a patch of blood on the right side of my face from being mashed up against the bag. I didn’t want anyone asking questions so I headed back into the bathroom to wash up, but suddenly I stop and look over to my left.” (Derek)\n\n“What were you looking at?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“A door.” (Derek)\n\n“What door?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I hate that door.” (Derek)\n\n“Which door are we talking about?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“The white one.” (Derek)\n\n“Derek why does that door bother you?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek massages three misshapen fingers on his right hand before answering him.*\n\n“I forgot about it over the years; blocked it out of my mind. The stack of boxes that use to be in front of it weren’t there anymore. It had been a long time since I thought about what happened that day.” (Derek)\n\n“What happened on that day?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“One rainy afternoon, when I was six or seven, Greg suggested a game of hide-and-go-seek. It didn’t sound so bad, especially having been cooped up all day. We played a few rounds of the game; and it was Greg’s turn to go and hide again. Yours truly was a natural at the game, avoiding all of the obvious places unlike my brother. But this time he found a spot in the last place I thought to look.’ (Derek)\n\n“I started on the top floor and looked under the beds, the closets, the kitchen pantry, everywhere, but I couldn’t find him. So I went downstairs and did the same thing there. That’s when I noticed this door, this unassuming white door in a recess by the stairs. I don’t know why I hadn’t noticed it before but there it was. I guess when you’re a kid the details of a house really aren’t interesting. The paint was flaking off, the knob somewhat rusty, probably from the dampness.” (Derek)\n\n“‘I found you. I know you’re in there!’ I said.” (Derek) \n\n“Of course butthead never came out, and I knew that he wanted me to open the door so he could jump out and scare me.” (Derek)\n\n“‘I quit!’ I yelled, and then pretended to leave.” (Derek) \n\n“I stood at the bottom of the stairs and waited. Finally I had enough and decided to leave. My foot didn’t even reach the first step when I heard the sound of a door creak open and then slam shut. For a second I didn’t budge because I wanted to turn the tables and scare him, so I leaped off the stairs and yelled ‘boo!’, but he wasn’t there.” (Derek)\n\n“Greg?” (Derek)\n\n“Then the knob on the white door turned and squeaked, and before I could run and hide the door flung open and Greg jumped out roaring. I told him that’s not how the game was played.” (Derek)\n\n“He then closes the door and says, ‘Who cares about some stupid game when there’s so much fun in there.’ (Derek/Greg) \n\n“What do you mean?” (Derek)\n\n“I’m not telling you.” (Greg)\n\n“That’s because you’re lying.” (Derek)\n\n“Don’t believe me then, it’s not for little wimpy kids anyway.” (Greg)\n\n“Come on Greg tell me, or I’ll tell mom and grandma!” (Derek)\n\n“Go ahead, but you’ll miss out on all of the cool stuff.” (Greg)\n\n“What cool stuff?” (Greg)\n\n“The stuff that’s in the trunk towards the back.” (Derek)\n\n“I looked back at the door; he then starts to walk away.” (Derek)\n\n“You’d better hurry before one of them comes down here.” (Greg)\n\n“Where are you going?” (Derek)\n\n“I already had my fun in there. I’m going to watch T.V.” (Greg)\n\n“I weighed my choices as I stared blankly at the door.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Greg, I bet he’s lying.’ I said to myself.” (Derek)\n\n“Call it a child’s curiosity, but I had to see what he was talking about, so I cracked the door just wide enough to fit my head through. The light didn’t reach very far before it was swallowed by the darkness so I pushed the door all of the way open which helped a little. To the right, were wooden shelves with rows upon rows of jars filled with what I’m guessing was either tomatoes or beets. Also there were colored bottles, candles, rolls of twine, and other random stuff. Instead of a convenient light switch near the door, that cellar has a single bulb on the ceiling with a short pull chain. Unsure if I could even reach it, tried anyway.’ (Derek)\n\n“With every step, the room grew darker and colder, covering me in goosebumps. Now that I think about it, there was a breeze, not a strong breeze more like an exhale, as if I was inside the mouth of some monstrous creature. I might have run out of the room if I thought of it like that back then. Whatever its source, it was coming from deeper within the cellar.’ (Derek)\n\n“Clearly, the pull chain was out of reach, but that didn’t stop a young kid from jumping up a million times only to barely graze it with my fingertips. I even tried standing on the edge of a shelf to launch off from like spider man. Finally, I got fed up and yelled Greg’s a liar and started to leave when his words came back to me ‘The cool stuff is in the trunk.’” (Derek)\n\n“Those words are like candy to a child, so naturally, I couldn’t resist, but in order to go any further I needed more light. By chance, I found a cheap plastic flashlight on one of the lower shelves, but it was in dire need of new batteries. I didn’t let it stop me; I was on a quest to find the mythical trunk of wonders which actually did exist. I was on the floor underneath a bunch of hanging garments. It was huge, and the fact that it was old and looked like pirate’s chest, made it all the more exciting. I lifted the wooden lid and snooped around when suddenly, the cellar door slams shut.’ (Derek)\n\n“I flinched and bumped the trunk, causing the lid to come hammering down on not only the flashlight and breaking it, but also three fingers on my right hand. Holding my fingers tight, I cried out in pain in the dark as I hurried to the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Dead bolted, someone locked me in. I screamed and kicked the hell out of that door.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Greg open the door, Greg, Greg, open the door!’ I pleaded.” (Derek)\n\n“My cries were answered, but not by Greg, but by a hoarse crackly voice coming from the other side of the door.” (Derek)\n\n“Serves you right for snooping around.” (Derek)\n\n“Grandma? Grandma let me out, I’m sorry, I promise, please grandma, please!” (Derek)\n\n“Zero response from her. Then the light beneath the door was blotted out, probably with a towel leaving me in complete darkness.” (Derek) \n\n“Grandma, grandma please, I swear I’ll never come in here again, I swear it!” (Derek) \n\n“Still nothing. Not even a child’s plea could thaw a heart so frozen. Regardless, I kept my hand posted on the knob and listened for the lock to turn, for the light to shine again. But instead, I heard footsteps trotting upstairs and the basement door closing. Frantically, I kicked the hell out of that door all the while screaming everyone’s name. They heard me, I know they did, yet nothing happened. Tears streamed down my face as I bawled my heart out. So dark, so cold, so alone, I was more of an inmate than a child; locked away in solitary confinement that became my dungeon.’ (Derek)\n\n“I started to shiver uncontrollably. I stuffed my swollen fingers under my left arm and slowly walked back to the garments that were hanging and began pulling them down to cover myself up with. I yanked a few extra garments off of the line to insulate me from the cold ground, and then sat down and cradled my knees.’ (Derek)\n\n“A short while later I jumped when I heard the snap of a mouse trap followed by a faint squeak. I never liked mice, never hated them either, yet in that moment I felt pity for it, dying in a place like this. In a way, I felt like a mouse caught in my own trap. It was hard to keep track of time so I’m guessing maybe an hour or two had passed when I heard the clamor of footsteps and cracking floor boards above me. People were walking back and forth, and I swear some of them were stomping like they were in a fucking marching band, probably Greg.” (Derek)\n\n“*Are they doing this on purpose*? I don’t know. The worst part wasn’t the darkness or my throbbing fingers, or even the commotion upstairs; it was their laughter, their fun without me. At no time while I was in there, did they show any care or concern for me; me a little boy who only wanted to play an innocent game of hide-and-go-seek with his goddamn brother.” (Derek)\n\n“‘I hate you, I hate you all!’ were the last words that I said before closing my teary eyes.” (Derek) \n\n“I couldn’t take anymore, so I slapped my hands over my ears to shut them out. I don’t how many hours passed until the door reopened, but when it did, I raised my head and saw in a ray of light mom coming towards me with a blanket.” \n\n“With a warm smile, she swaddled me in a thick quilt and says, ‘It’s supper time Derek. Are you hungry? Come on, I helped your aunt and grandma make a warm meat-casserole dish with mash potatoes and her delicious gravy that you love.’” (Derek/Mother)\n\n“I couldn’t believe it. She acted so nonchalant, as if I had spent the whole day playing kickball or something. I didn’t even get to eat lunch like everybody else did. My last frigg’n meal was at breakfast, didn’t matter anyway I think hunger was replaced by despair long ago.” (Derek) \n\n“She then says, ‘Oh, honey, did you hurt yourself; let’s get you cleaned up and put some bandages on your fingers.’” (Derek/Mother)\n\n“With tears welling I look up at her and searched for a mother’s sympathy, yet beyond the façade I struggled to find it. She nursed my hand and brought me upstairs to have dinner. Grandma smiled at me the whole time, asking if I would like some more meat-casserole, or ‘how about a slice of grandma’s chocolate pie’, more phoniness. No one seemed genuinely bothered by what had happened.” (Derek)\n\n“And then in the middle of drinking milk, Captain Asshole suggests, ‘Hey maybe after dinner we can play another game of hide-and-go-seek!’ I had to restrain myself from throwing my drink in his face.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Now Greg, Derek has had enough fun for one day, haven’t you dear?’ said grandma.”(Grandma/Derek)\n\n“*Yeah fuck you too* is what I should have said. Sooo badly did I want to lash out and tell them all off, but I was too sad, angry, and afraid. I didn’t say a word for the entire meal. I even skipped pie and lemonade on the porch and got ready for bed. As I pulled the sheets back I hear, “My darling boy.” Standing in the doorway is mom with a glass of lemonade to help me put the day’s events behind me. I began to cry.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Oh now, come to mommy.’ She said. She holds out her hand as an invitation to take mine. I extended one that wasn’t hurt, but she wouldn’t accept it.” (Mother/Derek) \n\n“‘No Derek,’ she says, ‘let me look at your other hand.’ I gave it to her.” (Mother/Derek)\n\n“She examines it like a caring mother would; kisses the bandages and then leads me by the hand out into the living room where grandma is sitting in a chair. I felt a sudden queasiness in my stomach, something was wrong. Her face… it was blank, expressionless, and she’s holding a short stick across her lap.” (Derek)\n\n“She looks at my mom and says, ‘Children need to be taught with the rod.” (Derek/Grandma) \n\n“I start to pull away, but the more I tried the tighter her grip. Mom forced my hand onto the arm of the chair. ‘Mom, no, no!’ I pleaded with her to stop, but before I could say another word, the stick slaps down upon my already swollen knuckles with hateful force. I’ve never screamed so hard in my life, it’s a wonder that I still have a voice. Mom released her grip, allowing me to hold my hand.” (Derek)\n\n“Now, that room is special.” Grandma said. (Grandma/Derek)\n\n“It’s where I keep canned food, supplies, and things dear to me, understand?” (Grandma)\n\n“Desperate for reprieve, I cry yes. ‘Good, that’s good to hear. You’re going to be a good boy from now on, aren’t you?’” (Derek/Grandma)\n\n“Yes grandma, I’m sorry!” (Derek)\n\n“Mom gives me a tender kiss on top of the head followed by a hug. Then mom receives a nod from grandma and she pulls me back to her. I watched in horror as the stick rose and fell, again and again and again. Unbearable pain; tears and snot poured out of me long after it was over. The punishment left me with three broken fingers that never quite healed straight. Mom would tell the doctor that I got my hand slammed in the car door. Before that day, I enjoyed coloring and drawing. I tried learning with my left hand but it wasn’t the same.’ (Derek)\n\n“Ever since then, I avoided the cellar; never looked at it, never thought about it.” (Derek)\n\n“What an awful experience. That wasn’t about teaching any lesson that was purely abuse. What was so important about that cellar? Jars of food, some supplies?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I don’t know?” (Derek)",

        "text": " \n\nWe arrived at the location that Dr. Camber told us about. We looked around and saw a frozen lake and not much else. We were in the arctic circle of Northern Canada. We walked over to the lake and examined it. It didn’t propose much about what we were looking for. We cautiously stepped on the frozen water, testing to see if it would hold our combined weight. Once we were sure it could, we walked out into the middle. We were in the exact coordinates Dr. Camber sent us too. Nothing. We set up our supplies, and started making our way out, slowly looking around the lake. The ice was so thick, we couldn’t see the bottom. One member reached the edge of their area. “Falcon 1 this is Foxtrot 3, I have reached the edge. Nothing to see here.”\n\n“Foxtrot 3 this is Falcon 1, head on back over.” Falcon 1, our team leader responded. Foxtrot 3 started walking back, then fell through the ice. I was the closest to his position and ran over. I stopped a few feet from the hole and slowly made my way over to make sure the edge would hold my weight. Once I was sure it would, I leaned over and stuck my head under water. What I saw blew the breath from my lungs. It was a pristine, white city. Shifting. Changing. Buildings combined, and broke apart. They changed shape. What amazed me most was that it was moving towards me. I saw foxtrot 3 trying to swim back up. “Foxtrot 3 this is Bluejay 2, do you copy?”\n\n“Bluejay 2 this is foxtrot 3, I do copy. Something is pulling me in. Send back up.”\n\n“Bluejay this is Falcon 1, leave foxtrot 3. Come back and tell us what you saw.” I looked back at the white city, realizing it looked frozen for the first time. It had come closer, and a vortex was starting to form under the water. I noticed that weirdly the water was warm, while everything else was cold. Foxtrot 3 was directly in the middle of the vortex. The city still crept closer, and the pull of the vortex was starting to reach me. I pulled my head up and backed away. \n\n“This is Bluejay 2, calling out to everyone, back off the ice.” \n\n“This is Falcon 1, calling to everyone, you heard Bluejay 2. Pack it up and move.” Once all the supplies were packed up and moved safely away from the water, I started to explain what I saw to Falcon 1. “What did you see Bluejay?”  \n“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you Falc. It was a city… A frozen city that was moving… Not just moving like locations but it was shifting. Changing… The buildings would combine, or break. And there was this… this weird vortex that started pulling Foxtrot in. The water was also warm, maybe like 26.6 degrees celsius. It was weird Falc. I don’t understand it. How did Dr. Camber know what was here?” \n\n“Those answers are above my paygrade Blue. But you did just start here right? This is your first field mission?” I nodded my head. “Well what you’re gonna see is only gonna get more weird Blue. Trust me.” I just stare at him, confused, worried, and most of all frightened. How could he be so calm about it? What had he seen before?",

        "text": "  \n\n**HOUR OF THE GOAT**\n\n**By Mark J Breckon**\n\nDerek meets Dr. Crane\n\n“Ah, you must be Derek.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“That’s me.” (Derek)\n\n“Please have a seat. Care for some water?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah.” (Derek)\n\n*Dr. Crane fills a foam cup with water from the cooler and hands it to him.*\n\n“Thanks.” (Derek)\n\n*He takes a sip and then rests his back against the leather sofa while Dr. Crane peruses the patient’s paperwork.*\n\n“So Derek, the reason for your visit today is that you are unable to recall a portion of your life, correct?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yes.” (Derek)\n\n“Ok, and how much time are we talking about?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I’d say about ten years.” (Derek)\n\n“Really, a decade?” *Dr. Crane said with some astonishment.* “That is a significant lapse.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah I know.” (Derek)\n\n“Well, I’m here to help you. Fortunately for you, the mind, particularly the field of memory, is a subject with which I am very familiar. So, starting off, the first question that I have for you is have you ever been to a medical professional regarding this issue?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I don’t know, maybe, that’s just it, I can’t remember. I don’t even remember how I got here.” (Derek)\n\n“Alright, so I’ll put head trauma in the maybe category.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Sure.” (Derek)\n\n“Hmm, I know there are certain conditions brought on by trauma that can impair both long and short term memory. But I think if that were the case you would be in a hospital or similar facility. You are twenty-two, correct?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah.” (Derek)\n\n“Wait until you are my age; last week I nearly forgot to shift the car into park before getting out.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek replies with a mild laugh.*\n\n“Being that you are twenty-two, that means that the last memory you can recall is when you were twelve?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek nods.*\n\n“Okay, then lets...” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Oh and another thing,” *Derek interjected.* “I don’t know if this is even relevant, but…” *Derek cuts short his own words.* \n\n“But what Derek?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Ah, I don’t know, I mean it’s kind of stupid really.” (Derek)\n\n“Your thoughts and feelings are anything but stupid, and what might seem trivial may actually hold the key to your problem.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I guess that makes sense. I can’t recall the last ten years of my life or what I had for lunch today, but there are other things that I can remember.” (Derek)\n\n“Oh, like what?” (Dr. Crane)\n\nDerek adjusts his body to the contours of the sofa, and then clears his throat before continuing. “Dreams, really eerie dreams that I can’t explain from long ago like when as was ten to twelve years old.” (Derek) \n\n“Is it the same dream reoccurring over and over again, or is each one different?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“They’re not exactly the same, but close to it. I’m always a lot younger, about the same age as when I had them.” (Derek)\n\n“Any other similarities?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Horror, pure horror.” (Derek)\n\n**Dreams**\n\nDr. Crane takes a moment to write in his notepad. “Unpleasant as this might be, I think that this would be a good place in our session to begin finding the answers that you are seeking, please continue.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*A nervous tremor moves through Derek’s hands; he clasps them together to help ease his anxiety.* \n\n“It’s okay Derek, take your time.” (Dr. Crane) \n\n“It’s nighttime and I’m asleep in bed. Then a noise coming from across the room wakes me up. I look over at my bedroom door and notice that it is partially open. Super groggy, I just lay there for a moment. The only source of light is that coming from the moonbeams seeping in through the blinds, but something’s wrong. The light reveals unusual shapes.’\n\n“I try to get up and turn on the light to see what these things are, but I can’t, I’m paralyzed with exhaustion. I can’t move my arms or my legs, I can’t even speak. Only my eyes are allowed to roam around the darkness. They shift back and forth in a frenzied panic unsure of who or what is in the room with me. Then my attention switches back to the door when I hear the unnerving sound of door hinges groaning; slowly, the door opens wider and wider. It’s too dark to see who’s standing there, but whoever it is I can feel them watching me.’ \n\n“Suddenly, a candle flame appears in the doorway, and a figure holding a red candle walks in. The tiny flame exposes a grotesque and twisted face bulging from a hooded cloak; it’s horrifying. Then those unusual shapes step forward, and they too are hideous. Choked by fear, I can hardly breathe. Then they grab hold of me and force my hands together and bind them with a belt or rope; whichever, I don’t remember.” (Derek)\n\n“What happened next?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“After I was bound, they began rubbing their hands all over my body. I can’t resist or scream for help; that’s where it ended.” (Derek)\n\n*Derek leans forward to take a sip of water.* \n\n“That’s quite a nightmare.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Apparently, my mind couldn’t distinguish dream from reality because when I woke up, my sheets would be soaked in sweat, even urine. No lie, I had to wear adult diapers to bed, which I was mercilessly teased for by my brother Greg. Can a dream be so vivid, seem so real that a person could feel actual pain from what was happening to them?” (Derek)\n\n“The wards of the mind are infinite and complex, and if it believes that pain is occurring than psychosomatic symptoms will inevitably follow. Some parapsychologists hypothesize that in extreme circumstances the mind has the capability of producing actual physical trauma, but that is a theory that prefer to avoid.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Mom use to say that she would find me in bed shaking so hard that she was convinced that I was having a seizure, flopping around like fish out of water; arms and legs flailing every which direction.” (Derek)\n\n“Were any injuries sustained during these hypnopompic events?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Hypnopompic?” (Derek)\n\n“It means the state of semi consciousness from sleep to wakefulness.” *Dr. Crane clarified.* \n\n“Well yeah, I’d find bruises, small scratches, and even finger nail dents in my skin. Mom threatened to make me wear a strait jacket to bed if it didn’t stop; I think she was afraid that CPS would be called. We had our differences, but at least she tried to make me feel better about the whole thing. ‘It’s just a phase that all children go through before becoming adults’ She once told me. For a while I believed that it was just a phase, but now I know it wasn’t.” (Derek)\n\n“There’s nothing like a mother’s love.” *Dr. Crane said with a smile.* “By chance, did anyone get this on video for observation purposes?” \n\n“No, I don’t think anyone thought of that. Mom did take me to a neuro-specialist, but even they hit a wall with it. All of the tests came back fine.” (Derek)\n\n“Indeed, this appears to be more psychological or emotional in nature rather than a neurological disorder or injury, and is perhaps the cause for the nightmares and loss of memory. Aside from going to a neurologist, were you ever taken to a therapist about this?” (Dr. Crane)\n\nDerek lays out the explanation with apprehension. “Ah, well no. I think the neuro-specialist did recommend a psychologist, but she never took me.” Mom kind of mistrusts them. To my understanding, she believes that people in your profession are only interested in padding their wallets.” (Derek)\n\nDr. Crane cocked his head back in surprise. He then ponders for a moment on what to say next. “Hmm, she’s both right and wrong. Under the care of a reckless therapist, a person can be cajoled into believing a false interpretation, leaving them in state of perpetual therapy ‘padding the wallet’. Lucky for you, I am not one of those “quacks”. (Derek)\n\n“Dreams and the subconscious are two areas in my profession that I find interesting and useful when it comes to unlocking those inner doors. But right now, what I’d like to do is digress for a moment and talk about your family, if it’s alright with you?”\n\n“Sure” (Derek)\n\n“Good, then let’s begin with your mother. To the best of your recollection, how would you describe your relationship with her?” (Dr. Crane) \n\n**Mother and Brother**\n\n“Ah, I’d say average.” (Derek)\n\n“Just average?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“It had its ups and downs. Mom is or was an accountant for a small firm; her job can be demanding at times.” (Derek) \n\n“What about on her days off?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Well, even then Greg got most of the attention.” (Derek)\n\n“Why do you think that was?” (Crane)\n\n“I don’t know, she loved him more?” Derek said jokingly. (Derek)\n\n“The feeling of a lack of affection or validation is common among siblings, and if it is not addressed it will inevitably lead to depression, emotional isolation, that will result in animosity. Now, is Greg older or younger than you?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Older.” (Derek)\n\n“Typical big brother?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Try typical asshole.” (Derek)\n\n“It sounds like he wasn’t very nice to you.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah, and he earned it. I endured a lot of abuse from him. Greg never missed an opportunity to hit or shove me, or degrade me with insults.” (Derek)\n\n“Was your mother aware of his behavior towards you?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Oh of course, and he’d get punished, but after a while the punishments wouldn’t stick. Like the time she took away his phone and grounded him for two weeks, but then later that night in bed I noticed the glow of his phone. He just looked at me with a smirk.”\n\n“She once told me, ‘With your father gone he’s the man of the house now.’” (Mother/Derek)\n\n“Man of the house, really? I wanted to tell her what the fuck does that have to do with anything? So that gives him allowance to torment me?’ Whatever.” (Derek)\n\n“Derek, can you give me an example of his typical big brother behavior?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah, one morning, while Greg was applying some pit stick, he paused, looked at me in the mirror, and called me a name. The insult was totally lame and not a big deal, but what hurt me was hearing mom laughing. It wasn’t a long laugh; more like a laugh quickly muffled by a hand.” (Derek)\n\n“Could she have been laughing at something else?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek shook his head no.* \n\n“When I walked out of the room, I saw her sitting on the edge of her bed drinking a glass of red wine. Her eyes told the truth; she heard the insult too.” (Derek)\n\n“It’s hard to know where to turn to when the person that you are supposed to be able to trust acts like that.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I can’t completely blame mom, it was her way of dealing with him. ‘Let him have his fun, better than dealing with his anger.’” (Derek/Mother)\n\n“She was right, to a point. Greg’s temper even intimidated adults; his teachers hated him. Grandma knew how to control his temper.” (Derek)\n\n“Your grandma did?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I seriously think Greg was intimidated by her. I mean he acted like a whole different person around her. It was odd, almost uncomfortable to watch him coddle her every need. ‘Need a pillow grandma?’ ‘Want your feet rubbed grandma?’” (Derek/Greg)\n\n“I don’t know what was worse, the fakeness or the strutting around in his boxers and tank top or no top, all oiled up and showing off. And of course both mom and grandma would praise him for keeping so fit. I thought to myself *bro what are you doing*?’ He didn’t start acting like a kiss-ass phony until high school.” (Derek)\n\n“So he worked out a lot?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Total gym rat. One time, when grandma spent the weekend at our house; I sensed another revolting runway show looming on the horizon, so I decided to add a little motor oil in with his coconut oil.’ From the moment he put it on he knew something was wrong. I watched as his face puckered and frowned; I nearly pissed my pants with laughter. I prepared myself for the beating of a lifetime, but didn’t care, it was worth it. The thing is the beating never came, not a punch or even an insult.” (Derek)\n\n“That was good, right?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I wish he had hit me or called me a name. Instead he…” (Derek)\n\n“What? What did he do Derek?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek feels his stomach turning as he thought about it. Finally he answers him.* \n\n“He, he pressed me up against the wall and began twisting my nipples. I tried pushing him off, but he was too strong.” (Derek)\n\n“‘You know this turns you on; you little wimp!’ he whispered to me.” (Greg/Derek)\n\n*Derek struggles to continue.* \n\n“He, he then kissed me on the mouth.” (Derek)\n\n*Dr. Crane postures himself back against his chair.* \n\n“Your brother kissed you on the mouth?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek sighs* \n\n“I felt so violated. I just wanted to shed my skin like a snake and leave the shame on the ground. The worst part about it was that it was my brother, my own brother.” (Derek)\n\n*He pauses to reflect on the incident. A respite in Dr. Crane’s questions allows Derek time to process and continue willingly.*\n\n“What happened next?” (Dr. Crane) \n\n“I don’t know; the sick fucker walked away. Couldn’t move; I’m not even sure how long I stood there. Later on after the initial shock wore off, I plunged my face into my pillow and bawled.” (Derek)\n\n“Did you tell your mother or someone?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Why bother, he would’ve just denied doing it, or worse confess and nothing would’ve been done. I could imagine mom saying to me, ‘You started it by messing with his oil, don’t instigate him if you can’t handle the consequences.’ Anyway, it was way too embarrassing for me to tell anyone. I didn’t want to believe that it happened at all, and that the retelling of it would make it real. Ultimately, I felt denial was the best remedy.” (Derek)\n\n“To some, a person’s rights and dignity are mere abstractions to be trundled aside. It is worse if it comes from a family member especially one so close. I have to ask, was he under the influence of any medication or illicit drugs that you know of?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*Derek takes a moment to think about it.* \n\n“Not that I’m aware of. If anything, insomnia was probably the cause of his sick behavior. He’d sleep for a few hours, wake up and go prowling around the house for the rest of the night either watching TV or lifting weights.” (Derek)\n\n“Lack of sleep can do that, alter one’s behavior.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“More like mutate in his case.” (Derek)\n\n“What do mean?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“About two or three nights later, after that disgusting kiss, I saw him coming out of mom’s room just as I was leaving the bathroom, wearing a long sleeve flannel shirt; the same kind that our dad wore.” (Derek)\n\n“‘Greg, the shirt.’ She said.” (Mother/Derek) \n\n“He removed the shirt, handed it to her, and then went to back to bed. I don’t think he noticed me, or if he did he didn’t say anything. I asked mom about it the next morning. She sat me down, laid her hand upon mine and explained it to me.” (Derek)\n\n“Aside from us, the shirt is the only thing he left behind. It’s a silly hope really, but maybe it is reason enough for your dad to come home and get it, and when he does, he’ll realize that he made a mistake and that we’ll be a whole family again.” (Mother)\n\n“I asked her why Greg was wearing it last night. That’s when her grip grew tighter and squeezed my fingers until they turned purple.” (Derek)\n\n“I’m going to tell you something that you cannot tell anyone else, do you promise?” (Mother)\n\n“I gave her my word and listened.”(Derek)\n\n“As you know, your brother has trouble sleeping from time to time. The pressures of high school, friends, girlfriends, can be a lot for a boy his age. He needs a way to express his worries, his frustrations that only a mother’s love and understanding can provide. He also needs uninterrupted sleep; with your nightmares keeping him up at night, it’s a wonder that he can even stand. As a mom, it’s my job to do all that I can to help my children.’ (Mother)\n\n“But being a single mom, it’s hard to keep a teenage boy from indulging in juvenile antics without the help of a male role model, so I’m thankful to have my mom to turn to when things get out of control. And I know that you both miss your father; I miss him too.’ (Mother)\n\n“His absence has left a hole in our lives, especially Greg’s, who is having a very difficult time handling it, and last night was one of those times. When he couldn’t sleep he came into my room and stood in the doorway with tears in his eyes. I held him as he cried on my shoulder. He then asked if he could wear dad’s shirt. After putting it on he collapsed into my arms, where I held him until he was calm again. Yes, he can be rude and obnoxious, but he can also be sensitive and sweet. In a sense, wearing the shirt is his way of still feeling connected to him; do you understand what I mean?” (Mother)\n\n“I think so.” (Derek)\n\n“I hope so. I’m just trying my best to do what I think is right.” (Mother)\n\n“There, I think I nailed it. I had to fill in a few words of my own here and there, but close enough. Anyway, I thought to myself *dad or no dad; I don’t act like that and never will*.” (Derek)\n\n**Father**\n\n*Dr. Crane quickly jots something down in his pad before continuing.* \n\n“Your father, may I ask where he was during this difficult period in your life?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n*The question evokes a brief silence in Derek.* \n\n*“*If this is a sensitive topic for you, we can move on or come back to it another time.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“No.” (Derek)\n\n*Derek said softly before clearing his throat.* \n\n“He abandoned our family. At least that’s what the police concluded when they hit a dead end.” (Derek)\n\n“And what do you believe happened to him?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“I believe that the police did a fairly thorough investigation but missed something along the way, a clue or a witness to his disappearance. I was four when he went missing. The image of metal hangers strewn across the bedroom floor is still fresh in my mind. All of his clothes were gone, along with a suitcase from what mom said. I suppose that’s all a man needs to start a new life.” (Derek)\n\n‘But you would think that if a person were to just up and leave that they would at least take their car with them.” (Derek)\n\n“He left his car?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Yeah, it was still parked in the same stall as it was the day before. He hadn’t gone to work, and none of his friends had seen him either, or had any idea where he was or could have gone to, or why he would even leave. He was a hardworking man who loved his family. That’s what puzzles me the most; a true family man with no enemies and lots of friends.” (Derek)\n\n“I know it was especially hard on mom; she did what she could to keep us afloat. Even grandma was there when we needed her. She didn’t have a clue as to what happened to him; she simply told us that he found a new life elsewhere. What else do you tell a child?” (Derek)\n\n“Not much else. The excruciating question then becomes would it be easier for us to mourn the dead or go on hoping that one day the missing will come back to us. On one hand if he were deceased then it becomes final, and the stages of grief would come to pass, leaving you and your family with acceptance. On the other hand in a situation where the individual has been missing for a long time, hope remains as the primary sentiment.” (Dr. Crane) \n\n“Perhaps after x amount of time passes, they do return home, but until then, hope is just a euphemism for perpetual uncertainty. I apologize for interrupting; is there anything more you would like to say about your father?” (Dr. Crane)\n\n**Father and Dream**\n\n“Kinda, I mean maybe it’s not worth mentioning but years after his disappearance, I had a dream of him, and for whatever reason I always felt that it was more than a dream, like it was a message from him.” (Derek)\n\n“That is interesting. Tell me about this dream.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“So it starts out where he and I were walking along this wooded trail sometime around the end of fall. We were laughing and having a good time until we heard the sound of leaves being trampled under a weight that was not our own.” (Derek)\n\n“We then stopped and turned around. Standing there looking at us was a goat, a black goat. Its presence made me feel uneasy, but I extended my hand anyway in a gesture of friendliness as you would a dog, but dad lowered my arm and told me to keep moving. We turned back around and started walking, and again we heard its footsteps.” (Derek)\n\n“Eyes forward and don’t stop.” (Father) \n\n“He said in a firm voice. I don’t know where we were going, but his focus grew more nervous with each stride. Then the air began to thicken with a light fog.” (Derek) \n\n“Eyes forward.” (Father)\n\n“But I didn’t listen and looked back anyway. When I did, I wished that I hadn’t; the goat was no longer on all fours; it was on its hind legs, walking towards us.” (Derek)\n\n“Eyes forward!” (Father) \n\n“He shouted. It unleashed a hideous bray, causing me to look back again and I saw dark red foam oozing from its mouth. Dad grabbed me by the wrist and quickened his pace. Off to the left of the path I could see the head of another goat peeking out from the mist, and it too began to run on two legs and chase us. Then more goats appeared, and they brayed with mouths full of blood. In our rush to escape, I tripped over a rock or a root or something, but if it wasn’t for dad’s firm grip on my hand, I would have fallen.” (Derek)\n\n“Run Derek, run faster and wake up, wake up!” (Father)\n\n“But blocking our escape there was another goat. Dad let go of my hand and charged at it, but the goat began to melt into black puddle that turned into a hole. I cried out to warn him but it was too late, he fell in and disappeared.” (Derek)\n\n“Hole was the wrong word to use, a hole has walls; this was a void, a bottomless pit to some dark dimension. I called down to dad, but no answer, just silence, even the braying had stopped. I started crying; then all around me I heard the sound of leaves crackling, and when I looked up, I was surrounded. They stood there, gnashing at their bloody cud, and in a chorus of brays they attacked me; that’s when I woke up.” (Derek)\n\n“Gives me the fucking creeps just thinking about it. I know it was only dream, but what are the chances of me having this dream and then he goes missing the next day?” (Derek)\n\n“That depends. What we perceive as just a dream could really be insight into something else.” (Dr. Crane)\n\n“Like what?” (Derek) \n\n“Well for starters certain events could trigger it. Maybe it was something that you saw on television, or perhaps sometime before his disappearance your parents had an argument and you inadvertently heard him say I’m leaving, or possibly on a metaphysical level, an abstracted premonition.” (Dr. Crane) \n\n“Most of the tv programs I watched at that age were either G rated or PG, and I don’t remember any arguments, but I can’t be entirely sure about that. As far as premonitions, fortunetelling, the stars holding our fate, I don’t know; I really don’t believe in that kind of stuff. (Derek)\n\n“Like the universe, the doorways of the mind are mysterious.” (Dr. Crane)",

        "text": "Imagine a world in which the sky is purple, the stars, the clouds are missing, and so does the moon. Imagine a world in which the inhabitants don't rely on jobs or anything similar in the slightest to survive. Imagine a world in which the humans are nowhere near the top of the food chain. Imagine a world in which the darkness... is the only thing keeping you safe. That was my introduction to the DarkLands\n\nA week ago I was in the library, I needed a book for my electronics and automation class. I didn't like the university I got into, I didn't like my classmates, my life felt \"lifeless\". \"Are you bored?\" the cashier asked. Without thinking much about it I answered a simple \"Yea\" and turned to leave. The cashier then asked me again but with a somber tone \"Are you really bored?\" There was no one else in the store, so I looked behind at the old lady on the other side of the counter. She had a small grin she was trying to cover. \n\n\"Yes, why? Do you have an offer for me?\" I replied.\n\n\"I sure do\"\n\nThe second she finished her sentence I blinked and I realized I was in the middle of a dark alley with no light. The sky had a purple tint, there was no moon, no clouds, no sun, no stars, nothing. The street lights were all on the ground, ripped in half, destroyed by God knows what. The sidewalk wasn't much different, scratch marks that weren't from any animal I knew of were plastered all across and from where the road was supposed to be, there grew trees as tall as what I thought was more than 200 feet, they seemed to have fruits that I couldn't make out since their branches were far too high for me to see with no binoculars, let alone without light.\n\nMy shocked state was interrupted by an animal growl which I can only describe by a sound a lion merged with an elephant could reproduce. It came from the woods behind me. I took off running having a feeling that whatever made that sound wouldn't have pity on my soul. I don't know how much I ran but at one point I stopped, not only to take deep breaths but to listen for any sound, because my gut was telling me I wasn't being followed by a single creature. The weird thing was, I don't remember there being any sound except for the one coming from my nostrils. I started breathing slower and slower until there was only silence. The wind wasn't blowing, the insects, if any, didn't make any sound, the animals were nowhere to be seen or heard and the sky was turning darker by the second. It was the first moment in my life when I felt truly alone.\n\nSuddenly, a humanoid figure appeared from behind, he had all the features of a person except he was probably above 14 feet and had muscles on every inch of the body. He looked like he could fight off an elephant. He stared menacingly into my eyes.\n\n\"How old are you?\" he asked in the first human voice I've heard in forever.\n\n\"20. What are you?\" I replied knowing fully well this could be my end.\n\n\"Why do you not tremble? Why are you not afraid. Human.\"\n\nIf I were to give him an answer it would've been that I didn't knew either, but the truth was I've been trained to do that, even though \"trained\" isn't the best word for it, in most situations I can stay calm in order to think and my brain was saying that this is not a situation to panic in, I had to think. Whatever this monster was I had to find a way out.\n\n\"Our territory,\" a voice screamed as a young woman was making her way to us with a weapon in her hand.\n\nThe giant shot her an angry look as he left. He put his hands down and started running on all 4 with the speed of a car.\n\n\"Year? What year are you from?\" The woman said hastily.\n\n\"2022. What? Why?\" I replied more surprised than anything.\n\n\"Planet?\"\n\n\"Earth.\"\n\n\"Come with me.\" I stood for a second and looked at her, \"NOW!\" she screamed with her eyes opened as wide as humanly possible.\n\nShe started running with me right behind her. Our speed was similar but her stamina outshined mine by a lot. Whispers started coming from behind us as we made our way to what looked like a desert with massive cuboid structures of different lengths. She took out a flashlight and pointed it ahead.  When we got close enough to the border between the forest we were in and the desert we were running towards, the woman I was behind took a sharp left and after a couple more seconds we ran into a door. She opened it with a key and screamed at me to go inside. I went in and looked behind to see her struggling to close the door. There was a thing, a very dark silhouette behind the door, probably the source of the whispers. \"NEXT ONE\" she screamed as she let go the handle. The second door was unlocked and we managed to get behind it and lock it.\n\n\"I know you have lots of questions so let me answer as many as I can. But first, let's eat.\" she said looking like she managed to cheat death, but not for the first time.\n\nWe descended into what looked like an underground house with a bathroom, a kitchen, two bedrooms and a living room. There was nobody else here. She opened a cabinet and pulled out two portions of canned pork and beans. \"You're not allergic to these, are you?\", I shook my head to communicate that I'm not and I'm more than ready to eat. She microwaved them and then we sat down. It was probably the best meal I've had in my entire life. After I finished it, the events of the day started coming back to me.\n\n\"What was all that? Who are you?\" I asked trying to stay calm.\n\n\"My name is Megan. What about you?\"\n\n\"Nolan.\"\n\n\"So, Nolan. Before I tell you what I know i need you to tell me more about yourself. I want you to tell me some of the biggest events that happened in the past couple years. In your world.\"\n\n\"Can you just go straight to the point and tell me what the hell is happening around here?\"\n\n\"Not until you respond to my 3 questions.\"\n\n\"Fine. Last major event in history was covid, a pandemic spread a across the globe. Next big one was a war that erupted recently.\"\n\n\"Second question, what day is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know? Like 27th of December.\"\n\n\"That's fantastic news, \" she said with genuine enthusiasm. \"And third question, tell me what happened before you arrived here and everything after that.\"\n\n\"I was the library, buying a book for one of my uni classes when the cashier, an old lady, asked me if I was bored, to which I responded to yes. After that she said something and I ended up here. I checked my surroundings and heard an animal like a-a-a lion and and an elephant merged. I ran a while and after a short break, a man appeared in front of me, he asked about my age and \"Why are you not scared?\". After that you came, you know the rest. Now please tell me this is all a dream so I can wake up.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately it isn't. We've all been transported here by the devil.\"\n\n\"You're kidding, right?\" If there's one thing I can't do without, it's a logical explanation.\n\n\"We just call it that, no one knows what he actually is. Anyways, we are in the DarkLands, we named it like this. It's a place where the creatures from the top of the food chain in their respective umiverse get transported along with a part of their habitat. I asked you about major events for two reasons, first being to see if we really are from the same universe and second to see if the land we are on right now gets teleported along with any of us, but apparently it's a replica.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any kind of sense.\" I replied, knowing fully well that the serious look on her face meant she's telling the truth.\n\n\"Tell me about it, I've only been here for 2 weeks. Anyways, every once in a while a number of people appear, well not only people, top of the food chain guys do too but in their respective region. From what we've learned, the rules for these entities are 1: they have to be dominant on their planet, 2: they need the ability to speak with one another properly and 3: they need to have a chance at survival. So you won't see any small insects or stuff like that.\"\n\n\"Now you're just bombing my brain with information.\" I felt overwhelmed, how could that be? How could my perception of reality change? I thought to myself.\n\n\"You'll get used to it, we don't even know fragments of it, we don't know much about the other species or the rules of this universe, all I've told you could be completly wrong but it's what we have to go with for now. Let me continue and then you can ask any questions. The elephant-lion sounding thing, we have no name for it, they didn't want to discuss it with us. We call them Elions And yes we can talk to any creature. They actually are the size of elephants but are far more agile and are carnivore. The tall man you saw in the forest was a Cerento, they didn't develop advanced technology but instead they evolved to fight any animal. They told us how they fought off dinosaurs. They consider us inferior and so do we. We have a pact with them that they can't come into our territory and we can't either. From time to time a rogue comes. The dark thing you probably saw behind the door is a Darklin, we just named them that way because they only move in the dark which is good because night comes rarely. If the sky is anything but black, it's day. Darklins, I can't describe them to you, we can't really see them, only feel them, they defy what we know about the world, we would probably need to take math and remake it to understand what those are. They're more of some kind of energy, don't have any form in particular. The desert you saw while running here is their home, they live in the isolated cuboids that are connected.\"\n\n\"Why did the Cerento ask me about my age?\"\n\n\"He could've mistaken you for one of his own. They are about our size when they're 5 months old from what I undersrand.\"\n\n\"I honestly don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"You could start by washing the dishes as a thank you.\"\n\n\"You're a pretty nice person, are there others around here?\"\n\n\"Yes but most of them are in the center of our area, there is a massive city with all kinds of things. Rockets, underground labs, skyscrapers and most of the things humanity achieved. Also they might not be as nice as me. Let me ask you this. Do you have family at home? Friends, waiting for you?\"\n\nThat question seemed a bit mean, but from the look on her face she didn't say it with bad intentions. \"No, not realy.\" I replied honestly.\n\n\"Most of the humans, hell, even the creatures transported here were lonely, \"bored\" as the devil puts it, on the other world, people that wouldn't be missed by society. Expect the people you meet not to be too happy or nice. You seem like a smsrt enough guy, you'll figure everyone out, that's if we don't die before we meet them. Without weapons we're being hunted and decimated like pigs. Most of the city is destroyed, some creatures planted seeds beneath our roads and from them grew massive trees, some other creatures ran through our tallest buildings, we're mostly safe underground but we don't know for how long. The most one of us has stayed here was 2 months, they said the looked perfect back then. In just a few days everything went to shit. I've been here for only 2 weeks.\"\n\nI had just realised this was the longest conversation I've had in months, no, years. And I teared up a bit. \"Thanks, for saving me and for telling me all thes.e\"\n\n\"Hey, no need to get emotional.\" She said tearing up a bit herself. Then she hugged me. \"We all have to stick together.\"\n\n\"I'll wash the dishes now.\" I said right before an alarm started sounding. It sounded like it came from outside. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Oh God,\" she said visibly disturbed. \"There's an alarm system in place, it's covering our entire territory. We ring it whenever something bad happens to the main station and have to move to the next one.\" We stood there, unable to do anything for our fellow humans, powerless.\n\nI'm sorry this is all I can tell you about for now, I have to do something, hopefully you'll hear from me soon enough. This is a story about how we live on the edge everyday, waiting for our deaths.",

        "text": "  \n\nI like to go out late at night and walk along the railroad tracks, especially on a full moon night.  I like the way the metal surface of the tracks reflects the moonlight. It reminds me of the lights on the floor in a movie theatre leading you down the aisle and to your seat. It’s an invitation to something mystical and otherworldly. I would always venture out around midnight just to avoid the noise of people and traffic. I wanted no sound other than what the lonely night had to offer- no noise pollution from people and their trivial musings. \n\nOne Saturday I got out a little later than usual and I was well rewarded for my tardiness. An hour or so before it had been raining and even though some clouds were still lingering, they had dispersed entirely from the area of the moon, leaving an aura of blue mist. I walked along the tracks for about thirty minutes lost in thought. I was thinking about what I would do after graduation. I wanted to move downtown and immerse myself in the good life. I wanted to taste the sins of the city. \n\nAs I got to the railroad bridge that crosses over Mill Creek, I noticed a lump in the middle of the tracks. It was noticeable to me because I walked these tracks every weekend. It was my escape. I knew every detail and this was out of place. This was something different in my path. I reached in my backpack and got out my flashlight. I didn’t want to ruin the ambiance with man-made light but I had to fix whatever was intruding upon my favorite scene in life. I walked further towards the alien object and as I got nearer, I turned on my flashlight. Staring back at me was the shallow still eyes of a severed poodle head. \n\nThe expression on the poodle’s face- if that’s even possible- seemed to be one of anger and surprise. It was clean cut. There was nothing hanging out from the bottom of the animal’s neck. The eyes were still intact and the fur white as snow, although with a little splatter of blood. I didn’t mind the blood. It added to the story. This dog was on a railroad bridge, in the middle, with no place to go and a metal monster of death came roaring towards it with no compassion. All the dog could do was run towards the other side, but it could only run so fast. It couldn’t run at its best because of the surface of the tracks and the train was oh so much faster. Everything had conspired against it to insure its quick and easy demise. There was no chance of fighting back. \n\nI was amazed at the condition of the head and how clean the severance had been. It was almost artistic. The track always gives, but its gifts are sloppy and without any craft. They are explosions of entrails and fur, never as surgically precise as this find. To me this was a rare occurrence. The train had killed with a sense of artistic expression. There was no way I was not keeping this. I grabbed the poodle head and put it in my empty backpack. I was a collector, but I hardly brought anything home because what I usually found was destroyed beyond all recognition. This was an omen. This was a gift. \n\nI got home and went straight to my room. My parents were asleep and never bothered me about my late-night outings. Frankly, they are scared of me. I get angry and violent when they question me. I am capable of uncontrollable outbursts. \n\nI pulled the poodle head out of my backpack and stared at it for a while. I looked deep into the poodle’s eyes and wondered if I could get a glimpse of the fear that the dog had endured at the final seconds of its life. I was so thankful for the lucky find. I brushed the hair and cleaned off some of the blood but not all of it. I wanted it authentic to a point but presentable to my mind as the perfect kill- one with as little mistakes as possible. When I had finished, I put it on my bookshelf in a prominent place to display all its finer details. \n\nI had begun to worry about decay and how long my poodle head would actually last. I thought of ways to preserve it but I felt like it would ruin it somehow. Should I periodically freeze it? The answer was not forthcoming and I despaired. Then I thought that it was a waste of time and immoral to try and preserve something that was meant to rot. Rotting was nature’s way of erasing the soul. Why was I interfering with that? Then I hit on an idea. I would try to create more severed heads. I would abduct a neighbor’s dog and tie it to the tracks and see what the train would create for me. That was natural art and the correct way to go about accepting whatever gifts death wanted to give me. \n\nA week had passed and the dog I had abducted was tied to the tracks of the railroad bridge. It was a smaller breed and I would have liked something a little fiercer like a pit bull or a German Shepard but that opportunity did not present itself. I had to go with what was easier. I was a rookie at stealing dogs and did not want to get hurt. The dog was compliant enough though. I had put a bowl of all kinds of treats in front of him but the dog did whimper every now and then. Even if this would be a perfect kill, it was not the best set-up. I began to doubt my plan and started thinking of all the things that could go wrong. The most pressing issue on my mind was what if the dog was hit by the train, it’s body would probably be tossed over the bridge. The poodle kill was a lucky occurrence, one not bound to happen again. I decided to move the dog on further down the tracks. \n\nI walked about twenty yards from the dog and laid down in the grass somewhat removed from the tracks, but still able to watch the mayhem. I wished like Hell I knew the train schedule. This was absolutely boring and I hated just waiting around. I grew weary and fell asleep. \n\nI felt a chill creep over my body and I slowly began to awaken. It was morning and I had slept through the night. I could hear a crow cawing and a songbird singing. It was a mesh of notes alien to the ear. It was a song that was eerie, sad, and happy all at once. The birds shouldn’t have been in unison but somehow, they were and it irritated me so much that I immediately opened my eyes in frustration as if an alarming clock had been banging in my ears. My heart starting thumping with a fierce rhythm, a thumping hard against my breastplate. I froze with fear and admiration. \n\nCrouching next to the dog was an elderly nude woman or at least her skin had the appearance of being of some advanced years. She had long stringy black hair. She was extremely skinny and her arms were longer than normal. I could not see her face, only the back of her head. She was weaving like a cobra ready to strike and the dog was not moving. It was if the dog was hypnotized and frozen in place. I began to realize how white and pale her skin was and how her movements were odder than I had first realized. It was as if she was doing a dance. My curiosity outweighed my fear. I had to see her face and so I decided to move in closer. \n\nI crawled on my hands and knees hoping that whatever she was doing would take a while and I would have an opportunity to find a good hiding place nearby. She started to make a low humming sound and for some strange reason I noticed the crow and songbird again. The three seemed to be working together to make the dog feel calm and relaxed. A thought ran through my head that it wasn’t the train that had killed the poodle but this woman, or beast, or whatever she was had done it. I stopped because I saw her slowly lift her arm. She had to have had at least six or seven fingers all equipped with sharp curving fingernails. She was about to strike. It was heart-wrenching but magnificent as well. I had to watch the kill. I should have laid down flat but I didn’t because I wanted a better view. All the sudden the crow just went mad and began cawing and howling. It flew down from the trees and right in front of her face. She turned and looked and caught sight of me. The dog yelped and pulled away from the leash, snapping his collar. It ran through the field and escaped through the woods. At that point the woman turned back towards the dog and howled with anger. The dog had escaped. She turned back and looked at me in a menacing manner, ready to pounce and punish me for losing her quarry. \n\nI did not get a good glimpse of her faced but what I had seen was actually pleasing to the eye. Although her body was old and decrepit, her face looked young and appealing. I felt both repulsed and attracted to her. I turned and ran as fast as I could. I don’t remember looking back. I just knew that she was out to kill me. I felt fairly confident that I had enough of a head start to be able to outrun her to the road that crossed the tracks. Yet, I was wrong. I was knocked to the ground from behind, the side of my face pressed hard into the dew-covered grass. I felt her naked scaly feet on my back and started screaming. She grunted in disapproval. I felt her crouch down and then she sunk her sharp teeth into my shoulder. It felt like she had several rows of teeth, like a shark and the pain was unbearable. Within seconds though I could feel a warm thick liquid moving from her mouth and into my veins. It must have been some kind of narcotic, because I felt great and warm all over. I began to feel happy and light. I was in a better place mentally and then I passed out. \n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a basement with a dirt floor. Above me was a fluorescent light fixture with a greenish glow. I could feel that something had been tied around my mouth to keep me from yelling. My feet were handcuffed to the legs of a chair, but what I noticed more than anything was the pain in my hands. I looked down and saw that my hands were clasped as if in prayer, with nails driven through each finger to make sure I could never free up my hands. My index finger of my right hand was nailed to the index finger of my left hand, and the same for every other finger. I still had my pants and shoes on but she had stripped me of my shirt and I could smell alcohol, as if I had been sterilized for some archaic surgery. \n\nI heard the upstairs door open and I could see two sets of feet coming down the stairs to my left. I saw her bare feet and the work boots of a large man. She was still nude and walking crouched over. She looked even skinnier now than she had when I saw her at the tracks. The man had a beard and wore a flannel shirt and jeans. He was dirty and smelled awful. He smelled like fish and roadkill. As they walked towards me, I noticed her face again. She was exceptionally beautiful in the face, until she smiled. Not all of her teeth were sharp but only several on the bottom and they were blackened and different from the rest of her teeth, which were normal and white. Her eyes had very small pupils and were bespeckled with purple spots. In her hands, she was holding my severed poodle head. \n\nShe held up the poodle head and motioned towards it with her eyes. I could not talk so she looked to the man and he walked over and took the gag out of my mouth. She motioned again. I had no idea what she wanted so I just blurted out the first thing that came to my mind. \n\n“Poodle.”\n\nShe looked satisfied at this and smiled again. She let loose of the head with her right hand and patted her breast and said, “I am Poodle.” Her voice was metallic and low. I had no clue what she meant. She pointed at me and then I thought she was wanting to know my name.\n\n“My name is Rodney.” \n\nShe nodded no and said, “You are Poodle.”\n\nThe man then walked over behind me and grabbed me by the elbows and forced my hands over my head. As soon as my hands were over my head, she lunged at me and opened her mouth wide and bit into my stomach right over the top of my navel. At this point it didn’t feel like just a few sharp teeth but like a million.  More and more were puncturing my skin and hooking underneath so I could not escape her jaws. I struggled against her and fell to the ground. She fell to the ground with me, latched on like a string of fishing hooks. I could not escape. The pain was unbearable and I thought I was going to pass out but then I got that feeling again. I felt good and I fell into a dream. I dreamed I was with a beautiful brunette and her name was Poodle. I felt the man lower my arms to rest my hands on her back. He then dragged her and me up against the basement wall. \n\nI don’t know how long I had been out but when I woke up my hands were free from the nails and neatly bandaged. I look down to see that she was still attached to me but her body looked like it had been drained of all its fluids. Her head had swollen somewhat but her body had shriveled away to a gross dehydrated husk. I stood up easily as her weight was now negligible and I noticed that some of her fingers started to dissipate and fall to the floor as dust. I was disgusted and tried to push her head down off of me but she sunk her teeth deeper into my skin and as she did that my hands slipped down to her shoulders. They felt like dried up leaves and as the force from my attempted escape followed through her whole body snapped from her neck and fell to the floor. The belly underneath must have busted because I could see some organs and fluid leak from underneath the body. The smell was putrid and I vomited all over the half-mummified headless body. \n\nI ran upstairs and turned the door knob. It was unlocked. I pushed opened the door and sitting in the living room was the man watching an old console type television. He turned to me and smiled. He began to walk over to me and I was about to run but he held out his hands as if to tell me not to worry, that he was there to help. He grabbed a cover and wrapped it around me, making sure that the head was hidden. He went to the refrigerator and grabbed a soda. He gave me the soda and walked me to the front door and waved goodbye. \n\nWhen I got home that night my parents didn’t say anything. I imagined I had been gone a while but they were too scared to say anything. I got to my room and locked the door. Took off the sheet and laid in bed. At that point I felt the teeth in my stomach shrink and the grip loosen. The head fell to the floor. I rolled over and looked down to see a severed head smiling and satisfied but dead and lifeless. The purple bespeckled eyes staring at me with hate and love. I wondered what this meant and what was in the future. I guess I’ll find out. I picked up the head and put it in a prominent place on the shelf.",

        "text": "This isn’t some scary story. My life is in danger as I’m writing this. I don’t know what to do.\nPlease…. What should I do?\n\nIt started when I was hanging out with my girlfriend, Sarah, we were at the carnival together, celebrating our one year anniversary. Sarah loved carnivals. The way her brown eyes sparkled when she saw a little clown in those tiny cars. Her dark skin glowed under the lights along the side of the large track, hell I couldn’t hear any other man or woman. Not a scream or cry of a child was heard when I looked at her. She was perfect. But I cant get the sight out of my head. Her hair tattered and her bones broken and bent in places they shouldn’t be. Her perfect skin was bruised and cut. Her braids were ripped out and her lips chapped and swollen. I witnessed it all. The masked man beating her, dragging her away from me and I couldn’t save her. I tried my best to save her but I couldn’t.\nMy precious Sarah was gone. He took her from me.\nNow I’m here running for my life. The sounds of screams and cries by the witnesses fell deaf to my ears. \nWait. It’s silent.\n\nDid he kill them too?\n\nHot tears ran from my eyes. I lost my glasses in the chase so I can’t see. I cant even see what I’m typing now. But I pray , oh God I pray the police will find this note. They will know what happened to everyone.\n\nI don’t think I’m going to make it. The masked man has inhuman speed. I can feel his disgusting green eye look at me. \nI shudder thinking about it.\nThe way he stared at me. That horrid green eye looking straight at me while I witness him beat sarah to death.\nHe never spoke. He just stared directly at me as he ripped her apart.\nMy legs are achy. Im in pain. I cant see, I don’t know where i’m going, and I don’t know where to go. \nAll I can think about is the man. His dirty green hoodie, the grey tank top that was soaked in Sarah’s blood. His long , ragged brown hair and the mask. \nGod, the mask.\nIt was cut up but it hid most of his face. Grey and purple. Along with an “X” carved over the eye. \nHis skin was bone. He wasn’t human.\nOr was it tattoo??\nI think I saw a glimpse of fingernail shine on the tips of his skeleton appearing hand. Nono he wasn’t a skeleton. Must’ve been a tattoo.\nMy chest aches. My lungs are desperate for air. I cant breathe. But if I stop running he’s going to get me too.\n\nPolice ; if you see this, my name is William brown, I’m 18, and I just graduated high school 3 days ago. I was trying to enter William &amp; Mary collage in Williamsburg , Virginia, but as you can see, my body will be found In Virginia Beach. I was here with Sarah’s family. It’s her brothers birthday tomorrow.\nIf I die, take care of their family for me. Let them know that Sarah isn’t going to be at the party. \n\nHe found me. I hear him. Can he hear my breathing??? I’m trying not to cry. I’m curled up , back to a tree. \nMy throat refuses to swallow and I can’t breathe. If I breathe he’ll find me. He’s going to kill me just like the others.\nI don’t want to die.\n\nI don’t want to die at the hands of this monster. He’s barely human. Why would he do this? \nOh God he found me.\nHe’s staring directly at me. His green eye. \nI now know the bones are tattoos. \nHis right arm. His chest and neck. What I can see his left leg too. He’s all tattooed. He’s human.\nWhat kind of human does this.\nGod he has a bat. \nOh please someone call the police. Tell them to read this. \nPlease.",

        "text": "At midnight, I will no longer be me. You see, every time I moved into a new apartment, I felt that same presence, a presence that feels my fear and attacks me. And every New Year’s Eve is when this presence makes its move.\n\nTonight, I felt more of the same dread. When the clock strikes twelve to ring in January first, I fear I know I will no longer be Gail Pederson.\n\nMy best bet has always been to move elsewhere before the end of December. That’s been my strategy so far but it’s nothing more than a temporary fix. The thing is I can’t escape. And I know these aren’t the same spirits attacking me either. This presence presents new faces and new people in this cryptic cycle.\n\nI don’t know why the presence keeps following me. I wasn’t conventionally attractive given my lanky physique and pale skin. I wasn’t anything special considering I was a part-time clerk living off my mom’s inheritance. But then again, I guess you aren’t targeted by looks. In fact, no one has ever offered me a reason at all for why the presence is so fixated on me. \n\nRight now, I was staying at yet another cheap apartment that had nothing but the bare essentials: an uncomfortable bed, a modest kitchenette, and a bulky T.V. that still had rabbit ears. The lone window I had offered me nothing more than a third-floor view of the urban decay looming outside.\n\nBut at the moment, that view nor the New Year’s Eve show on T.V. were what held my attention: Rebekah did. I saw her in the small mirror hanging on the wall, the reflection showing Rebekah standing completely still and upright in a corner of the room. Rebekah was quite different than me given she was conventionally attractive, her skin dark and smooth, her face rounder rather than angular, her style consisting of a tight red tank top and ripped jeans rather than the leggings and tee shirt I wore. The baby blue Converses she wore and the flamboyant piercings made it clear she was from the 1980s youth… even though as we were on the cusp of 2019, Rebeka was a teenager and almost ten years younger than me.\n\nI looked on in horror but not shock. There by the window, I brushed my bangs aside for a better view of Rebekah’s reflection since that was the only way I could see her given I saw no one standing in that corner without the mirror. After all, mirrors were how I often saw the presence.\n\nThe attacks from Rebekah this year were similar to what I’d suffered throughout 2017. That version of the presence was much different: a tall Southern Gothic socialite. Every day, I felt her presence, and in the mirrors, I’d see her stalking me in that flowing gown that likely dated back to the early twentieth century.\n\n“Midnight,” her Georgia accent would tease me all year long. Then on December 30th, 2017, the presence had become strong enough so that the socialite could run her gaunt fingers through my hair. “2018 will be our year, dear,” she told me. But that New Year’s, I managed to get a new apartment seemingly hours before that deadline of the dead. I was still Gail.\n\nBut inevitably Rebekah came along on New Year’s Day 2018. She was a 1980s New Wave warrior and even more aggressive than the socialite. Rebekah would yell at me. Taunt me. Her harsh punches and shoves sent me to the floor many times over these past twelve months. Above all, she fucking terrified me.\n\nOnly I was broke this year. Real broke. I couldn’t go anywhere else but apartment twelve here at The Ashby House. I had no friends much less a boyfriend in Atlanta, I had nothing save for those evenings and late nights spent with the presence’s latest form: Rebekah.\n\n“New Year’s Eve,” Rebekah would tell me before wrapping her hands around my throat. “Midnight, bitch,” she’d sneer.\n\nNow December 31, 2018 had arrived. I knew I’d have to fight for my life in my latest apartment just as I had done these past few years. You see, the move last year didn’t protect me. It just delayed the inevitable.\n\nI knew I only had a few hours left as Gail Pederson before becoming Rebekah: unless I found a way out.\nShivering in the cold, I paced around the apartment, doing my best to avoid Rebekah’s sneer in that mirror. My fourth glass of vodka did nothing to alleviate the anxiety.\n\n“There’s not much time left, girlie,” Rebekah teased me behind a hungry smile. “Then I take over.”\n\n“No!” I yelled out without dare looking at that mirror. “You’re not taking me!” Stumbling back, I reached toward the door, keeping my eyes straight ahead even though I saw no sign of Rebekah in the corner.\n\n“Midnight,” Rebekah’s voice followed me. “I’ll take over at midnight.”\n\nI ran out the apartment and slammed the door behind me. Alone in the hallway, I scanned the desolation, knowing good and well there were no other tenants here at The Ashby House. Open windows let the chilling Atlanta air further unnerve me. I saw darkness out in the city streets that wasn’t much different than the dim lighting in here. Amidst the growing fear, I looked around at the cryptic portraits surrounding me on those old white walls. One of them showed a glowering southern socialite, the same woman I knew all too well from 2017.\n\nTerrified, I looked over at apartment eleven. That was the same apartment I stayed in last year and the same room where the socialite nearly possessed me. I caught another chill. I felt tears in my eyes. There wasn’t enough time. The Ashby House was a two-hundred-year-old boarding house that may as well have been a brick cemetery. I’d escaped the previous eleven spirits that the presence had absorbed in this building over those two centuries… all eleven spirits that had no chance at escaping The Ashby House unless they possessed someone else: me. \n\n“Oh god…” I said helplessly. I brushed away the tears but couldn’t brush away the horror. Left with no other choice, I confronted apartment twelve. I heard desperate pounding coming from the other side of the locked door as the brass knob shook with ferocity. I truly had nowhere to go even if I left The Ashby House right now. My time was up: apartment twelve was the last room.\n\n“Midnight!” I heard Rebekah’s scream careen through the empty house. “At midnight, you’re mine!”\n\nr/rhonnie14FanPage",

        "text": "(First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/y2iym6)\n\nFor two weeks I got into a good routine with work. I had a suspicion that me and my partner was getting stuck with the easy jobs no one wanted. There was no shortage of jobs that we just needed to hands off a package to an almost human appearing creature then getting their signature. For a while, I almost thought I might not come across any problems with my job. I was dead wrong. \n\nI walked into the Zero room and saw Max arrived first. Our package to deliver strapped to his back. Good thing I had him because there was no way I could carry such a wooden large box. It was covered in odd writing and paper also with strange symbols on them. I could have sworn I heard the box rattle when I stood next to Max. \n\n“We’re heading into a red light district to drop this off. It’s on the supernatural side of things, so they’ll be a lot of creatures.” He explained adjusting the straps on the box. \n\nMy attention was drawn from the box by his statement. Not only dd he mentioned that we were headed to a pretty adult kind of place, he suggested we could be going into somewhere dangerous like The Maze. I really hated The Maze. It changed every time I went inside and nearly die there a few times. \n\n“Where is this red-light district? Like Inside the Maze or something?” I asked trying to make sense of it. \n\nHe shook his head and directed his attention over to his sister who gave him some sort of silent approval to explain a bit more. \n\n“There are different worlds. We never really bothered telling you because, well, no one thought you would live long enough to go to one.” He admitted. \n\nMy surprise was ruined by everyone’s lack of faith in their only human delivery worker. I suspected a whole multi-verse idea but never really thought too much about it. After all, The Maze wasn’t a part of the same realm of existence I lived on. I never considered just how many other dimensions might be out there. And what was The Maze? How far did it go? Was it larger than where I lived and housed countless creatures ready to overtake our world? And what kind of place would a supernatural red-light district be? \n\n“It’s best if you don’t think too deeply over this. It can get confusing really fast. You’ll be fine travelling to a different world than your own. Just don’t drink the water.” Max said and he took my hand so we could get a move on delivering the huge box ion his back. \n\n“What happens if I drink the water?” I asked. \n\nHis response was a tight smile. I did not want him to go into details about what could cause that expression. I just followed along with him and out the door into a place where humans rarely went besides as food for the creatures that lived there. \n\nAt least this answered the question about where Max lived and how he lacked knowledge of human culture when we first met. If he didn’t live on the same level of existence than myself, we may never had met if I didn’t get this job. That made me wonder again what Max was. He's never told me a name for his species. He may look like a cute dog person, but I’ve seen hints of how scary he could be. My thoughts derailed when we arrived to our destination.  \n\nThe long streets were crowed with countless different creatures of all shapes and sizes. Others called out in languages that no human tongue could ever form. Max kept a good hold of my hand so we didn’t get separated. Because we wore mail uniforms, the creatures acted pretty respectfully towards us. Some shuffled out of the way the best they could to let us carry on with our jobs. The buildings were pretty much piled onto each other with a mixture of glowing flames and floating lights of different colors shining through the night. I glanced over at some sort of food stall selling what looked to be grilled rats. It smelled far too good for what they served.  \n\nAs we walked deeper into the long main street, I felt my face flush seeing the other advertisements in the windows and on the pathway. Some practically naked human appearing creatures were trying to lure other creatures inside. This place really lived up to its name, I didn’t want Max to see such a thing being the innocent creature he was. To my horror, a woman only wearing some very well-placed ribbons came over to us. Max appeared to know her and they spoke in a strange language. She gave his head a little pat and kissed his forehead before letting us go back to work. \n\nI stared at him trying to make sense of the interaction. He noticed and showed a smile my way. \n\n“I’m very popular here.” He said without a hint of shame. \n\nMy feet got glued to the ground as my world view started to tumble down. Max was popular with the girls. My cute innocent Max was being recognized by pretty much all the workers here. His clued into what I was thinking and finally corrected my train of thought. \n\n“Oh, my father comes here often. I’m popular through him. I don’t use any services they offer but all the workers like to say hello when they can.” He explained which helped ease my mini heart attack. \n\nWe started walking again but knowing Rufus got around didn't help my mood at all. I did not want to think about him hiring these kinds of services either. \n\n“So, Rufus and your sister’s mother isn’t together anymore?” I asked. \n\nIf he was here often that meant he wasn’t married, right? Max shook his head and paused to think of a way to explain in a way a human may understand. \n\n“He got married and had my sisters as a power move, if that makes sense. They’re still married in order to combine the family's strength. In fact, I’ve been promised to marry and produce a child with my step niece in order to boost the whole power thing more. My dad can go off and well... be with any kind of creature he wants as long as he doesn’t produce another child. But I feel as if that did happen on accident, we would just accept the mother and child into our family. I never hurts having another helping set of hands.” \n\nI chewed on my bottom lip unsure of how I felt about this. It was clear Max loved his sisters and not matter how much they tried to hide it; they loved him too. I didn’t like the idea of him being forced into a relationship just for the sake of making another strong creature to back up the family's ranking. I stopped walking again, holding onto his hand feeling uneasy. \n\n“Are you alright with that? Sleeping with someone because you were told to?” I asked. \n\nHe gave a shrug but I could see it bothered him a little more than he wanted to let on. \n\n“Right now, I don’t even have a step niece. If one comes along, it’ll take a few hundred years before she gets old enough to marry. My step aunt might not even ever have a daughter. I’m not overly worried about it. But if it happens well... I think I can deal with it. It won’t be traumatizing if I need to sleep with someone I don’t care for.” \n\nWe both stood in the middle of the crowd thinking over what he said. I kept a tight grip on his hand feeling the warm soft pads against my palm. Max lived in a completely different world than myself. He was raised in an environment with a whole culture that I wasn’t a part of. Most likely he’d known he would need to marry someone he didn’t love since he was a child. For his kind, marriage was for power and not for love. It wasn’t my place to judge their system. It still didn’t sit right with me. Max could read my silent expression and gave me a quick hug trying to assure me he really was fine with his planned future. I found it hard to hug him back because he still wore that huge box we needed to deliver.  \n\nWe started walking again going through the crowd. Max paused to go buy some sort of meat on a stick which I declined to try a bite of. \n\n“So uh, what if you fall in love with someone and want to marry them? Would you not be able to do so?” I asked trying to clear up some questions. \n\n“I guess it depends on the creature. But we have no limit on spouses. More the better where I come from but it’s different from family to family. Honestly, I’ve never been interested in that stuff. I wondered if it’s because I just became a full adult but... I like thinking more about what to eat the next day than getting all romantic with someone, you know?” Max said between bites of food. \n\nI understood him. Aside from the shame of still holding a V card at my age, I really didn’t feel motivated to find a girlfriend. Now with work I found a bunch of friends I cared for. I didn’t feel that lonely anymore. It would be nice to have someone to come home to though, but I didn’t feel pressed on finding a partner right away. \n\nAfter a long walk we finally found where we needed to deliver the box to. It looked like a large dark warehouse. A sliding door was open for us. The moment we walked inside, the door closed leaving us in a very dimly light open space. Max didn’t look scared in the slightest. I shouldn’t be as frightened as I felt but couldn’t help it. This was spooky. \n\n“You are both a little bit late. Did you take a break to enjoy what some of the shops have to offer?” A voice asked from the darkness. \n\nA man came forwards into the light. He wore a sharp suit and had perfectly styled hair. Aside for, his yellow eyes and scales on his cheeks, he looked human. His voice had a hint of an accent that matched his confident pose. Two more men came to stand behind him. They might as well be triplets. They all looked the same besides the unnatural eye colors.  \n\n“We did. Sorry.” Max admitted as he walked over to place the box down. \n\n“He got something to eat.” I quickly corrected. \n\nThe leader let himself smile for a second at us. He signed the sheet Max offered saying we finished our job. For some reason Max moved fast afterwards. He took long steps back to me to take my arm. I found myself being hustled away as the man in the suit bent over to pull a piece of paper off the box. I looked over my shoulder to see him lift off the wooden lid, and then the box fell apart. \n\nI knew why Max wanted me to leave before I saw what we delivered. The moment my eyes landed on what was inside, I planted my feet hard on the ground. I turned my body back around ready to deal with what I was seeing. \n\nInside the box was a sleeping person. I guessed them to be male even though they had long hair. Well, it wasn’t really hair. They only wore a long white shirt over top of a transparent body. The long hair looked as if someone shaped it out of gelatin. The figure moved after spilling out of the open box. They sat up, barely able to keep their head raised, both arms firmly tied behind their back. The man in the suit reached down to take a hold of the poor person’s arm to lift them on their feet. Once standing, a scared expression came over the creature’s face. They looked over in my direction and our eyes met. \n\nThey had a round spot of transparent orange that reminded me of egg yolk inside their head. It helped give their face some definition. I could see the frightened expression clearly. This person begging me for help. \n\n“What are you going to do with him?” I asked in a low voice. \n\nMax appeared stressed beside me but didn’t say anything. He took a hold of my hand as if he wanted to protect me from something. The men in the suits gave a smile that twisted my stomach. The one wrapped a hand around the clear creature’s waist and it made the poor thing turn their head away in disgust. But they knew better not to try and escape from the men. \n\n“Where do you think we are? It's clear we’re going to put this little thing to work.” The man said and the two behind him joined in with a low laugh. \n\nI felt sick. The room spun for a second. We were a part of this. We delivered this person to these monsters. I refused to let this happen. I took a step forwards, Max trying to keep me back with his hand over mine.  \n\n“He’s a person! You can’t-” I started; my face hot in rage. \n\n“You’re human so you won’t understand.” The man cut in. \n\n“That doesn’t have to do with any of this! You just can’t force someone into that kind of work!” I pressed. \n\nMax pulled me back, his concerned face calming me down before I snapped in a fit of rage. The man shook his head with a sigh as if he was dealing with a child. \n\n“This creature is artificially made. Due to them being so new, they don’t have a species name. But some have taken a liking to calling them Bedroom Tools. You can understand why, can’t you?” He said with a terrible smile on his face. \n\nI gritted my teeth wanting to punch him, to do anything to bring this poor creature out of this situation. \n\n“But, let me rest some worries you may have. Normally these creatures have no sentience of their own. They can only do what they are told. Like an empty doll. This one not only has a rare coloring, but also hold intelligence.” \n\nHe removed his hand from around the creature's waist to grab under his chain in order to force him to raise it. I nearly did punch him then for handling the creature in such a disrespectful way. \n\n“It’s illegal to use the sentient ones in that sort of way. Because they’re race is considered property, you are able to own one, but if they are aware of themselves, you cannot force them to do such work.” Max interrupted. \n\nA small ray of hope appeared only to be put out a few seconds after. \n\n“Recently we found a spell that removes their sense of self. If they are no longer aware, then we can use them however we wish? Correct?” The man asked. \n\nHe pushed the creature aside so his two back up could take a hold of one arm just in case the creature made a run for it. They weren’t being rough but made it clear they would be if it came to that.  \n\n“That spell hasn’t been proven to work yet. We don’t know if the creatures are not fully aware, or if you’re just sealing their expressions.” Max said, his hair started to puff up in the way it did when he was angry. \n\nMy partner’s tone sounded calm but he gripped my hand so tightly it hurt. I didn’t pull away from him wanting the pain to override my sense of dread. \n\n“That’s not our issue. We now own a rare specimen of a highly sought out species. After using a spell we can legally put him to work. We need to make what we sunk into this thing back, so unless you have something to offer, we’re done here.” \n\n“What do you want for him?” I asked quickly without letting myself think. \n\n“Toby...” Max said as a warming. \n\nHis concern came too late. The three men’s eyes lit up. Literally each of them flashed color for a second. The lead wasn’t able to hide a brief smile. They wanted me to make an offer. But I was human, what would they want from someone like me? \n\n“You’re a virgin, correct? No sense in lying. We can smell it from here.” \n\nIt felt like my entire body sunk into the ground. I looked between the men staring at me as if I was a piece of meat. Then I looked at the scared face of the creature I wanted to save. Did he ask that question because he wanted me to take that creature’s place? I swallowed hard, considering my options. My body shook as dread over took my thoughts. Not matter how much I hated the idea; I would agree to switch places with that creature if it came to that. No wonder why Max didn’t want to stick around after we finished the delivery. \n\n“I am.” I said in a weak voice. \n\n“We want your blood. In exchange, we’ll trade for this creature.” The man replied in a cool voice. \n\n“That’s it?” I said shocked. \n\nI knew my blood was sought after because it helped creatures heal faster but I never assumed it would be worth as much as a person. Max gave my hand another warning squeeze. He clearly knew something I didn’t. \n\n“How much of it?” I asked, the fear coming back.  \n\nA wide grin appeared on his face that sent chills down my back.  \n\n“All of it.” \n\nThe creature I wanted to save turned their head away. They knew I would refuse to give up my life to save them. I frantically ran through the offer in my mind trying to think of a way to make out of this alive. I didn’t want someone being forced into such a dreadful life, but I also didn’t want to die either. I looked over at Max considering the trade. Besides him and my co-workers, would anyone really miss me that much? I’ve been saving my pay from this job and my father would be comfortable if I died that day. He may be upset if I died before him, but it wasn’t as if we really talked that much now a days.  \n\n“Alright. We’ll trade you the same amount of blood a human of his size holds in exchange for ownership of that creature.” Max said and his words startled me. \n\nI did consider giving up my life, but I didn’t think he would have thrown me to the wolves with such a calm voice. I panicked a little wondering why Max would do such a thing. I knew he cared about me. There needed to be a trick in his words somewhere I wasn’t seeing. The three men started to get closer, their expressions making me take a step back. \n\n“But I’ll also offer you two Lunar Flowers in exchange for you keeping this trade a secret.” Max said. \n\nThat made the men stop walking. They looked at each other almost nervous. I once again, had no idea what was going on. \n\n“How would someone like you two have accesses to such a thing? We’ll agree to such a trade only if you can provide what you’re offering.” The one said in a low voice sounding very threatening. \n\nHe assumed Max was playing some sort of game none of us really knew about just yet. My friend smiled as if he didn’t have three very menacing people staring him down. With a nod he let go of my hand and gestured for them to let the creature go. \n\n“Alright. Both deals are good. Can you let go of him now? He looks scared.” Max said. \n\nThe men looked at each other and finally pushed the creature towards us. They hesitated and took careful steps forwards on shaking legs. To them, they were just traded to a pair of people they didn't know if they could trust. I quickly took off my jacket to offer it to the poor clear person shaking from fear.  After a second, they reached out a hand to take the jacket and quickly wrap it around trembling shoulders. \n\nThen all at once those men were around me. Eyes blazing with color, teeth sharp and claws out. \n\n“We’ll take our half of the trade now.” A low voice rasped out. \n\nMy heart started to race. If Max had a plan, now was the time to say so. I walked back into my friend and he took a hold of my shoulders to keep me in place. I almost doubted him for a few seconds. \n\n“I’ll call Dr. Fillow. He already has taken Toby’s blood and has it stored. He also holds onto the flowers for me. If you would like, I can ask him to mix the flowers and blood into the medicine I assume you three want it for.” \n\nThe men let their monstrous expression drop. They all looked pretty confused on what Max offered. I wanted to kick myself for being so stupid. I’ve been donating blood as often as possible since I started to work as a mailman. I didn’t think there was so much stocked up, but of course that would be what Max would offer first. The three looked like they wanted to accept the offer, but didn’t want to admit they got played by a cute boy with dog ears. \n\n“Well, since we were going to hire him to make it ourselves, this would save some time. But you are covering the cost of the mixture.” The leader said, crossing his arms. His followers mimicked him. \n\nI finally relaxed a little as Max made the phone call. I directed my attention back to the creature we saved wondering what to do with him. Or her? I really couldn’t tell. Maybe they could work delivering mail... Then again, seeing how scared and weak they seemed to be this job might be a bad idea. \n\n“Hey uh, sorry you went through all of this. I promise I won’t touch you. In fact, no one is going to touch you without your permission, ok?” I said hoping that eased some fears a little. \n\nThey blinked a pair of oddly transparent eyes at me. The shaking slowly stopped but they didn’t really look fully relaxed just yet. Max told us Dr. Fillow would be there in a few minutes with what they asked for. I wondered what kind of medicine he was making. It must be really powerful if so much of my blood and some mystery flowers was going into it. \n\n“Before he arrives, we need to do one thing.” The man said making us look over to the three. \n\nAgain, to my shock, all three of them got a few steps before the clear creature and then got on their knees. At the same time, they all bowed so low, their foreheads touched the ground. \n\n“We’re sorry for mistreating you!” All three said at once. \n\nI once again... Had no idea what was going on. They stood up and brushed the dirt from their knees all looking like much kinder people. They dropped the imitating expressions that made them all appear like completely different people. They noticed my expression and one decided to explain their actions. \n\n“We’re all Wyrms. I suppose a human like yourself wouldn’t understand, but we’re seen as lesser than other supernatural creatures because we’re related to Dragons. All of us have been bought and sold, then finally ended up here.” One explained. \n\nI glanced at Max who filled in a little bit more. \n\n“Dragons come from a different world that goes beyond The Silver King’s realm. Nearly all creatures don’t respect them because they don’t follow the King’s orders.” \n\nI’ll have to ask him to fully flesh out that concept later.  \n\n“Our current owner has been very kind to us. She’s given us a great deal of freedoms, but fell ill. We wanted to get something to make her better and heard a human was working as a mailman. We pooled our money together to buy this creature hoping you would offer your blood in exchange.” \n\nThat information made my mouth drop open. These three were acting the entire time? Was this creature ever even in any risk of being forced into such terrible labor? \n\n“If you refused, we were going to find a place for this creature to go. We all have been forced into some jobs we didn’t want to do. We like our jobs now, but didn’t want another person to go through the same thing we did.” \n\nI wanted to be mad. I really did. But in the end, everything turned out just fine. I got so scared for my life over nothing. \n\n“I assumed that all might be the case after you three requested us and had such a large package to deliver.” Max chipped in with a smile that puffed up his cheeks. \n\nI also wanted to be upset that Max was smarter than myself in seeing through their actions. He knew off the bat that I would start bargaining for the creature and thought of a way for everyone to get what they wanted at so little of a cost.  \n\nSoon Dr. Fillow came by with a jar in hand. The three men swarmed him excited to have the coveted medicine in hand. I couldn’t bring myself to dislike them after everything. Since he was here, Dr. Fillow came over to do a very fast check up on my arm. It hadn’t been giving me that many issues now a days. I’ve pretty much gotten use to how stiff it felt and other minor issues with it.  \n\n“I didn’t think you had so much of my blood on hand.” I commented. \n\n“I didn’t. We made some synthetic blood from a minor amount of yours. A drop can produce a litre so it’s been very useful in the clinic.\" He said after he finished looking over my arm. \n\nThe three in suits paused to look at their jar now suspicious of the content. Fillow noticed this and tossed over two very small glass vials to them.  \n\n“One is a drop of normal blood, the other is synthetic. If you can tell the difference I’ll let you drain Toby right now.” He stated in a huffy tone. \n\n“What?”  \n\nMy fears were ignored again. Thankfully after a long debated none of them could tell which held the produced blood and accepted the medicine was good enough. I now understood why Max tossed in some extra flowers in order to keep this deal from getting out. If creatures found out I would trade my blood for a life, the forced trades would never stop. A sound of someone saying Knock-Knock made me look over to the main door to watch Rufus of all people walk inside. Thankfully he had a new leg and walked pretty steady on this one. \n\n“What are you doing here?” I asked but was still happy to see him.  \n\n“Max told me of the friend you picked up. I doubt the slime creature can talk right now. I’ve raised a bunch of kids so I offered to get them up to speed.” He said in his friendly voice. \n\nI looked at the clear creature realizing it did look a lot like those slime people from newer anime. I haven’t watched any in a while so didn’t clue in until now. Rufus went over to them and held out a hand. He was so friendly and kind the slime creature took his offered hand right away feeling comfortable with the offer. \n\n“Do you have a name?” Rufus asked the creature. \n\nThey shook their head and then for some reason looked over at me. Since I traded my blood, I sort of owned them. I didn’t like that idea at all. But I didn’t want them to go without a name either. I could give them a nickname for now and they could change it later. \n\n“How about Sunny?” I asked wondering if that would be too weird or not. \n\nA smile finally broke through on the creature's face. Sunny it was. And the bright expression really suited them. They made a move to give me back my jacket but I said they could hold onto it for a while. I did have a backup one after all. With that settled, Rufus gladly went with Dr. Fillow so they could give Sunny a checkup. I didn’t know how long Sunny might be gone for. But at some point, I needed to make room for a new person in my apartment until we thought of some better arrangement. \n\nWith all that settled, we were about ready to leave. For once, I was in a good mood after a job that had been somewhat scary for me. The three thanked us again for agreeing to such a deal and taking care of Sunny. I nodded telling them to take care of themselves.  \n\nWe should have left sooner. The few minutes of polite good byes was my undoing. A shape moved in the darkness of the warehouse. Due to the place only being partly lit, I had no idea how large it really was. A sound came and I soon clued into it was breathing. The fear came back when I realized something very, very large appeared in the dark watching us. \n\n“What are my three little ones doing? Hmm? Bothering the delivery workers?” \n\nThe voices sounded kind, far too kind. As if they were trying too hard to not sound threatening. It tugged at my nerves. The three men smiled to look back at the darkness. A set of eyes flickered open to stare at us. Eyes so large they dwarfed us in size. Then more eyes opened in the dark reflecting the light back. A hoard of very small creatures stared at us between those other massive eyes. \n\n“Mistresses! We heard you got sick! We arranged to get some medicine for you!”  \n\nIn front of this hidden monster the men started to act as excited as children. I had a different reaction. My heart almost stopped when a very large finger came from the dark. It carefully gave each man a small pat on the head with the very tip of the claw. Then the eyes turned their attention back in me nearly making me faint. \n\n“That is very nice of you. I am feeling fine now. Keep what you earned for the future in case I fall ill once again. For the human, I thank you for putting up with these three. In exchange for being so kind, I shall sleep with you once. Any time you like.” \n\nI shook my head before the monster stopped speaking. I’ve faced death so many times and yet I rarely got this frightened. I didn’t want to know what this creature looked like, let alone take it up on the offer. A laugh came from the dark that made my teeth chatter. \n\n“Oh, you shall accept. At some point. They always do. Come now you three, you have work to do.” \n\nThe eyes closed and I heard the monster turn to leave. The men followed behind after giving us a wave good bye. Max noticed how shaken I was after such a short interaction. He picked a short cut to get back to the Zero room and I suspect he ensured we got very easy jobs for the rest of the day. \n\nBy the time I got home I felt so shaken I could barely do much more than curl up in bed wallowing in my own dread. Besides just how frightening a massive creature like that could be, I was mostly scared of what kind of hold it had on me. I shook my head no at the offer and yet internally my mind wanted to say yes. That monster’s offer had a pull on me in a way nothing ever had before. I just wanted to sleep and forget about it.  \n\nIt took a few hours but I forced myself to think about the new roommate that was going to move in shortly. If I didn’t focus in that, I might let my mind drift back to accepting that offer. I knew if I did, I no longer could return to myself. Planning out what I could do for Sunny really did save myself that night. But I find even now, a very small part of myself whispering it wasn’t too late to find and meet that dark Mistresses. I just pray I never really listen to that part of myself.",

        "text": "'Hmm...' The sound was loud in the small room, but after a pause she made it again. 'Hmmm...'  \n'What do you reckon, Carol?' I prompted, turning from the X-ray result back to my supervisor's pensive face. Another pause.  \n'The patient isn't any pain? Any...symptoms?'  \n'Not really. He came in for a suspected fracture from training, but hadn't felt anything before that. Nothing out of the ordinary.'  \nCarol was lit only by the X-ray screen, the blue light making deep shadows out of her fine wrinkles. Her jaw moved slightly as she processed.  \n'Run the procedure again, calibrate the machine properly, make sur-'  \n'All done Carol. We've scanned him as many times as we safely can, everyone calibrated the machine. Hell I X-rayed myself to check, it's all fine.' I wasn't used to interruping a Consultant like that, but my heart was racing from what I was seeing. More sharply than I meant to, I indicated the heap of films that showed a full and healthly skeleton picked out in textbook-sharp detail from myself, compared horrifyingly to those from the patient sitting quietly next door.  \nFor a few minutes Carol examined each one, her hmms turning to a grinding of teeth.  \n'This is completely impossible...' She muttered finally, more to herself than me.  \n'There's no doubt, we checked a dozen-'  \n'He's got no fucking bones, Jack!'  \nI jumped, as much from her swearing as the sudden volume in the enclosed space. A silence fell as we both composed outselves, the humming of the X-ray screen the only sound. On that screen was a film showing a translucent human outline, very normal for X-rays, but instead of the bright lines of bone there was just...nothing. A faint mark, ghosts of something where the bones should be, but the skeleton itself was simply missing.  \nSlowly Carol collected herself. 'Okay, talk me through it. Physical examination?'  \n'There's something there, solid, feels a bit...' I shuddered at the memory of touching the patient, how his tibia seemed to squirm under my fingers, 'wrong.'  \n'So there's something in there keeping him standing. Follow up tests? Vitals?'  \nThe next few minutes were spent running through heart rate, blood pressure, and other metrics that painted the picture of a perfectly healthy young man who was simply missing bones. Finally I explained the next steps.   \n'I've got a blood sample here which I'll take to labs, hopefully that will tell us something,' I patted the sealed vial in my breast pocket, 'and I'm waiting on the CT machine to free up next door so we can get a better look at his soft tissues. We wanted your input after that.'   \nMy bleep went off just as I finished talking, letting me know the scanner was ready. Carol ground her teeth again.   \n'I'm following this, you have my support.'  \nI led her through to the waiting room where our patient sat staring idly at the posters opposite. He was a wiry young man with slightly thinning brown hair, and casual clothing like a lot of the staff. As we entered he looked up with a concerned expression, no doubt wondering why so much attention was being given to a minor fracture, but Carol simply introuced herself and asked if she could take some observations which the man hesitantly agreed to. It was left to me to explain that we'd found a small anomaly, that there was nothing to worry about, but we just needed to confirm a few things before we sent him back to the lab and would he consent to a quick CT scan? Carol counted his pulse and felt his arm as he gave another reluctant agreement, and once she was done we walked him to the other room and got him ready for the scan.   \nThe control room was next door, separated by a pane of glass and an intercom. Once we settled I turned to Carol as the machine warmed up.  \n'So, what's your expert opinion?' I asked, no irony in the question.  \n'There's something there of...clinical significance.' My Consultant said guardedly, 'I'm very interested in these results.'  \nI activated the scanner and the patient began to slide through the huming plastic ring. 'You being super formal is worse than your swearing, you know.'  \n'Mmmm.'  \nThe minutes ground past, my heart beating faster with each one. The patient asked a few questions during the process, if it was safe and if there was anything to worry about, but I reassured him over the intercom and reminded him to stay as still as possible. When he asked what we were doing I explained that a CT would give us a better view of soft tissues, muscles and organs and such. Just to check if the fracture had damaged anything, I added, nothing to concern him. Finally it was done. Barely breathing, I pulled up the results on the screen as Carol craned forwards.  \n\\_'What the fuck..?'\\_ She breathed.   \nI zoomed in with shaking hands, not believing what I was seeing myself. Carol was just repeating the word to herself over and over again as her eyes devoured the horror on screen.  \n'Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck...'  \nI panned over the image, but they were everywhere. Everywhere that was meant to have bone had been replaced by-  \n'Quarantine.' I looked up at Carol, but she said it again, louder and more firmly. 'Quarantine! Right now. Lock the doors, we need security.'  \n'Okay, I'll go to-'  \n'No, here too, you and me. We've touched the patient.' She walked over and locked the operation room door, pulling out her phone and dialling a number at the same time. 'The door Jack, now!'  \nMy skin began itching at her words, pins and needles and a deep sickening crawling sensation. Us too? Quarantine? Contaminated with...those? My hand was obeying my superior though, hitting the button to lock the door of the CT room. The patient's head snapped up at the sound, looking first at the door and then through the window at us. He was starting to panic now.  \n'Just a precaution sir. There's nothing to worry about.' My voice was thin, high on the intercom. Unconvincing. I didn't care though, my eyes were fixed on the results screen, on what the CT scan had revealed.  \nInsects. Thousands of them. Densly packed together, columns running throughout the patient's body. Their carapaces picked out it blinding white on the screen, bodies locked together by spindly legs, needle-thin antenna poking out from the masses. The X-rays had passed right through them, but the CT scan revealed them in sickening detail. The terrible things made shapes, and with horror I realised they had taken the place of his bones; the radius, ulnar, femur, even the god damn skull remade from a mosaic of insect bodies each smaller than a grain of rice. I felt dizzy. I'd felt them moving...  \nCarol was speaking to someone and the patient's voice was coming in tinny over the intercom but I wasn't listening. A cold trickling feeling was spreading throughout my body and my mind was going faint. All at once I threw up. Missing the bin completely but managing to at least get the floor and not the equipment, I collapsed hard to the ground. The pungent smell of bile filled the room, adding to the sensory malestrom.   \nAfter a moment I felt myself being lifted, and turned to see Carol helping back into the chair.  \n'Stay still and breathe deeply.' She instructed. 'Water is on the way, so spit for the moment if you need to.' She stood and said something to the patient before turning off the intercom and results screen, leaving only the light from the CT room to fill our little space. It helped a little, but the images were still burned into my mind. Finally she knelt in front of me, careful to avoid the vomit, and held my arms as she talked me through a breathing exercise. Slowly I came back to myself, the panic receeding.  \n'Sorry.' I muttered, 'I don't like bugs.'  \n'I'm not a fan myself, especially not those ones.' She said kindly. 'Your bones don't feel like them if that helps. Just a few minor cuts.' She indicated my arms and a spot of blood on my chest.  \nBefore I could reply Carol's phone rang and she stood to answer it. I shivered and did my best to fight off the feeling of phantom itching from inside my body.  \n'Understood, we won't attempt to leave...You don't need to keep saying it Sue, I know what lethal force is... Water, Cleaning supplies too if possible. Yep...okay, bye.' She let out a shakey breath as she hung up, before looking over to me.  \n'We're under instruction to stay in place, these two rooms are now considered a quarantine zone. Apparently they've seen something like this before, but it's not a good prognosis. If you have it...well it's like rabies.' Another shaky breath, 'Once they're in there's no way to stop them.'  \nI felt sick again, but swallowed it down. Questions whirled through my head. They knew these things existed? Is this part of what our facility is studying? What happened to the first patients, why can't they stop it, why does my skin itch, did they really say lethal f-  \nBefore I could voice any of the torrent in my mind, I was jolted by a bang right next to my head. Our patient had come to the joining window and smacked his hand into it, desperate to get our attention. Without the intercom we couldn't hear any words, but he seemed to be shouting.  \n'Jesus...' Carol muttered, clearly also startled. She took one look at my face. 'You stay there, I'll do my best to reassure our patient.'  \nBoth \"reassure\" and \"our patient\" seemed to ring slightly hollow in our current situation but I didn't protest. Carol spent a few minutes doing her best to talk the patient down before giving up and sitting down next to me. As she did, the patient began thumping the diving window again.  \n'He's not happy, but there's nothing we can do.' She explained grimly. 'Some symptoms are setting in, pain, panic, nausia. I didn't tell him what was wrong though. I couldn't face it...'  \nIn all my time working with Carol I'd never see my Consultant look so degected. As gruff as she was, she'd been a bulkwark against all the mess and nastiness of working here. Shouldering both responsiblity of the patients as well as what we did.  \n'This isn't our fault Carol, we did the best we could.' I tried, 'Maybe we could still help him.'  \n'Mmmm.'  \n'I mean it. Tests, or something. Maybe we can fix whatever those bastards upstairs did to him.'  \nThis caught her attention. Slowly she looked up, meeting my eyes. All kindness and comradary was gone, instead there was now a look of steel-hard contempt etched onto her face.  \n'Jack, you know what we do here. This is our fault, those bastards are us. We did this to him.'  \n'No...'  I said, my voice thin again, 'No, we're radiology. We just scan the patients, look after them. We don't-'  \n'Do you honestly believe that?' She asked sharply. 'You think you're not a part of this? Too small of a cog in this place to be noticed?'  \n'I...'  \n'That you're not responsible? A naieve little rad tech that doesn't have blood on his hands?'  \n'That's not...'  \n'At least he can admit he makes weapons. At least I, and the patient, and everyone else in this godforesaken place can look ourselves in the eye and know what we're really doing.'  \n'Carol I didn't-'  \nShe was angry, angrier than I'd ever seen her.  \n'Look that poor bastard in the eye and tell him we don't make bioweapons. Look at him through the glass and tell him you're innocent.'  \nI felt sick again. Her eyes were cutting through me, pinning me like needles under my flesh. Next to us the banging on the joining window continued, and I imagined I could hear him howling. But I didn't look.  \n'Can you even tell me his name Jack? I haven't heard you address him by it.'  \nAgain, I couldn't answer, couldn't bring my self to look up at my patient and his screams. Carol made a noise of disgust.  \n'I get it. Like a farmer with cattle. It's easier if you don't get attached, right?' She walked away towards one of the computer terminals. 'I'm going to write this shitshow up, as well as a recommendation that we review your fitness to practice. I'm not happy having someone of your disposition under me in this facility.' She looked at me again. 'If you want any chance of keeping your job, I recommend that you look your patient in the eye and come to terms with who you are and what you do.'  \nThe  banging had stopped. Shamefully, I turned to look at the body of my patient.  \nExcept he wasn't dead.  My heart stopped. In front of the window stood a melting man. His limbs were distending, lengthening and distorting as I looked, skin stretching and bubbling. The spine deformed, bending him forwards horribly towards the glass as his jaw flopped open and his skull collapsed on one side. The stretching skin began to split, white shapes pouring free from the gashes, but now I could barely make it out through a film of tears. I heard myself scream, collapsing down at the same time that poor bastard's legs gave way and he fell mercifully out of view. I don't know how long I sat there sobbing for. Eventually Carol's voice came from above me.  \n'This is what we do here Jack, and you need to be okay with it. For now I need the sample vial you took from Mr Xuan. You're not fit to keep it safe right now.'  \nShakily I reached into my chest pocket, obeying without question. Immediately there was a sharp, burning pain and I pulled my hand out with a yelp. A half-inch cut wept blood along my index finger. In horror I looked inside, only to see the glint of a shattered sample vial wink up at me, right where I had landed on it. Terrified, I looked up into Carol's face which had drained of colour.  \n'Right...' She said, 'Okay. Okay, I'm going to ask what the transmission vectors of this particular project are. You.. .stay still, and over there. Let me know if you feel anything.'  \nI simply nodded, unable to speak, trying desparately to ignore the itching coming from deep within my right arm that was slowly spreading upwards.",

        "text": "I live in the hilly forests of northern Alabama.  It’s a rural area and there isn’t much unless you go towards Birmingham.  One thing that is only about a mile away is an old radio mast, that after doing some research, I discovered is one of the old AT&amp;T “long lines” towers with the rusty horn antennas.  I hadn’t noticed it for the two years I lived here before that point, and I probably would have never noticed it, but there’s been some strange occurrences and I have come to believe that the mast is the cause of them, even though these old towers have been unused for some time, according to the internet.\n\nThe first event happened about a month and a half ago.  I haven’t had cable or satellite for some time, and only stream content from my phone to my tv.  Signal interruptions are incredibly rare with this type of setup, as an interruption should theoretically just cause a pause for more content to load.  However, on that night, the tv became staticky and and unwatchable.  I reached to disconnect my phone, but even my phone screen was glitching out.  I ended up turning off the tv and my phone altogether, and in the silence, I heard something outside.  I went out to my back porch and heard a metal-on-metal screeching in the distance, and the only thing in that direction was the radio mast, blinking with its red obstruction lights against the night sky.\n\nA week later, I was editing a video on my desktop late at night when I heard a quiet but incredibly annoying high-pitched tone coming out of my headphones.  I checked the cables and their connections, but everything looked fine.  Still, I unplugged them and switched to an old pair of earbuds.  I heard the same sound immediately.  Then I tried bluetooth headphones.  Again, the tone was there.  Perplexed, I reached over and picked up my old ThinkPad to see if it was the desktop’s port that was causing the noise.  I heard the tone through the wired earbuds, even though I hadn’t even plugged them in yet.  I walked around the house wearing the earbuds and holding the cable out in front of me, and noticed that the sound was loudest in the back right corner of my house.  The moment I opened my back door, the sound became unbearable and I had to take the buds out.  Even in my hands, I could hear them get louder or quieter based on the direction the cable was.  I quickly saw that they were loudest when the cable’s long side was facing the tower, and that screeching sound from before was faster and more distinct.\n\nOnly three days later, I was cooking when my lights and appliances started to flicker consistently.  The house had been quiet, but I heard that now familiar screeching outside, stronger than before.  I glanced at my phone, and it was completely useless- pixelation on the screen, unresponsive, and no cell reception.  Furious, I stormed to my back door and threw it open.  I’m not sure what I was planning to do (yell at the tower maybe?), but I instantly felt sick once there was nothing but air between me and it.  I tried to look up towards it, but even my vision seemed distorted and my eyes started to burn and tear up, so I retreated back inside.\n\nSince then, the tower has started to do that in a cycle.  It starts once it gets dark, and stops when the sunlight touches it.  I’ve lined my house with foil and the like, and try to just clench my way through every night.  I can’t afford to move so I don’t have a choice.  But, it’s getting stronger.  I can *feel* the tower in my head.",

        "text": "I was always an adventurous person, always seeking out new challenges and experiences. When I went on vacation in a small town (I can't remember the name right now) in northern US, I knew I had to go for a hike somewhere nearby. The next day I packed my bags and set off early in the morning, excited to explore what to me was a completely unknown place.\n\nAs the day went on, I marveled at the beauty of the forest. The sun filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow over the landscape. I took in a deep breath of the fresh, clean air and smiled to myself. This was exactly what I needed - a chance to escape the stresses of everyday life and connect with nature.\n\nBut as the sun began to set, I started to feel a sense of unease wash over me. The forest seemed to grow darker and more foreboding as the light faded. I told myself it was just my imagination, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.\n\nI quickened my pace, trying to get back to the safety of my car as soon as possible. That's when I saw it.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just a tree. It was tall and thin, with bark that looked almost like skin. But as I got closer, I realized that it wasn't a tree at all. It was a creature, a monster.\n\nIts skin was a dull grey color, and its eyes glowed a bright white. It seemed to be staring right at me, and I froze in fear. I knew I had to do something, but I couldn't move.\n\nSuddenly, the creature moved. It wasn't a tree after all - it had been posing as one, waiting for its chance to strike. It lunged towards me, and I finally found the strength to run.\n\nI raced through the woods, not daring to look back. I could hear the creature's footsteps behind me, getting closer and closer. I knew I couldn't outrun it forever.\n\nAs I ran, I couldn't help but wonder how this creature had come to be. Was it some sort of mutated animal, or was it something more sinister? Whatever it was, I knew I had to escape it.\n\nI scanned the area, looking for anything I could use to my advantage. My eyes landed on a group of rocks off to the side of the path. I veered off the trail and made a beeline for the rocks, hoping to use them as cover. As I darted behind them, I heard the creature let out a guttural growl. It had lost sight of me, at least for the moment.\n\nI took the opportunity to catch my breath and assess my situation. I was lost in the woods, being hunted by a monster that I didn't understand. My phone had no reception, so I couldn't call for help. I was completely alone.\n\nBut I couldn't give up. I had to find a way to escape.\n\nI peeked out from behind the rocks, trying to get a sense of where the creature was. I saw a flash of movement off to the side, and I knew it was still searching for me.\n\nI had to make a decision. I could stay where I was and hope for the best, or I could try to outrun the creature and make a break for it.\n\nI decided to go for it. I burst out from behind the rocks and sprinted down the path, not looking back. I could hear the creature's footsteps behind me, but I didn't dare turn around.\n\nI ran as fast as I could, my feet pounding the ground. I could see the glimmer of my car in the distance, and I knew I was almost there.\n\nBut as I reached for the door handle, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see the creature standing behind me, its white eyes glowing in the darkness.\n\nI closed my eyes, expecting the worst. I waited for a couple of seconds, panicking, immobilized by fear, when i opened my eyes: the creature was gone. It had completely vanished.\n\nI never went hiking in the woods alone again. The memory of that night still haunts me to this day. I decide to tell this story because it was a burden I wanted to get rid of for a long time, and to remind people that even in the beauty of nature, there can be dangers lurking in the shadows. The creature may have somehow been a product of my imagination or some kind of hallucination, but the fear it instilled in me was very real.",

        "text": "Well, I'm having a shit time! I caught a massive cold and my back hurts like hell. None of this would have happened if y'all weren't so goddamn stupid, you know? Of course, my pride has also been majorly wounded by having to crouch and crawl before someone like the wood-demon. I had to give him a promise, but I'm gonna keep that to myself for just a little while longer.\n\nAnyways, my brother Casimir is staying over. He's probably the one family member I have the most contact with. The others have scattered across the country, and aside from the money they send me to help with the upkeep of the safety measures around the forest, there's not much communication going on. Hell, I don't even know what they do for a living for the most part. Casimir's a real-estate agent, so I know he's definitely a crook, and I hear one of my sisters married rich and now owns a gambling hall in Vegas. Good for her, I guess.\n\nThere's definitely some family resemblance between Casimir and me, but he's way leaner and taller and he's got a hawk nose. He looks a lot like some humanoid bird of prey altogether, but in a good way. He's a very handsome guy, which has led a bunch of unfortunate women to fall for him. He's got these pale green eyes that have already sent countless girls over the moon. That he's also a total asshole with unresolved mommy issues was something they had to find out the hard way. Lord knows how many times I've gotten calls and texts from weeping girls who'd looked me up to get an answer as to why he'd disappeared. \n\nOn top of that, he's got a bit of a gambling issue. Since I live and entertain the woods off of the money my siblings send me, that's been my problem occasionally as well. He provides me with a substantial amount on a regular basis, but sometimes, he'll come around and need it back because he's made some debts again. Sometimes, he comes up with other little side-businesses, and then he'll send money on that, but it's never worked out thus far. Bit of a waste, for sure.\n\nHe's still my favorite brother, though. I like him for the person he is around me, not for how he acts when he's away. And the thing is, he'd do anything for me. \n\nOne of my employees answered the door for him this morning while I watched from my window. After ringing the doorbell, Casimir raked a hand through his slicked back blond hair and readjusted his grip on the bouquet he was holding. Black callas. My favorites. Shortly after, I welcomed him into my room. After our mom had died and Dad had moved to Cali, I'd taken over the master bedroom as it was more spacious. I'd thrown out every last piece of furniture and put up completely new wallpapers. In fact, I have long since renovated all the rooms in the house. A lot of them serve as break rooms for the employees nowadays, some with beds or cots so they can nap. \n\n\"I still can't believe what you've done with the place,\" he remarked. \"I keep expecting Mom and Dad's old room when I come here. Feels weird.\"\n\n\"It was way too expensive,\" I admitted, plopping down in my armchair. \"I kinda regret it. I should have left everything as it was. Woulda saved me a fortune, but I felt like I needed to do this at the time. How long are you staying for?\"\n\n\"Depends on how long *that* is gonna last,\" Casimir replied, waving his hand in front of me to indicate my altogether state. \"You look like shit.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said dryly. \"But, like, why are you here?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine sent me this.\" He whipped out his phone and proceeded to show me several screenshots. I groaned, instantly feeling a headache coming on upon taking them in. They were of an online article—I won't drop any publisher names but think buzzfeed and the like. Someone had written about my woods, in the vein of a dark tourism recommendation. Location, description and everything.\n\n\"Now, before you get all panicky, this friend is actually one of the editors of that site, and he also has a share in it—when the author submitted it to him, he recognized it. I'm real glad I told him about where I'm from that one time. Who knew it'd pay off. Anyways, it was easy enough for him to let it disappear on my behalf. He helped me bribe the author never to write anything like it again, so not to worry. That's not the end of it, of course. I looked us up and it turns out we're an insider tip with the horror nerds! So I figured I'd best go and visit my big sister. My big sister'll know what's what. Or not. Maybe my big sister needs to catch a break.\" He leaned back in his seat, smiling as he patted down his shirt. \n\n\"Aw man, you have no idea,\" I muttered. \"It's been hell over here.\" \n\nSo I told him everything, and now he's made himself at home in the guest bedroom for what's probably gonna be a couple weeks. He'd had enough foresight to take time off work to help me out. I expect he'll be able to find more hires in no time, charming as he is. We're going to revise the guards' routes tonight and try to locate the blind spot where all these \"tourists\" keep coming in through. Aside from that, it's really just such a pleasure having someone around who I'm close with. I know I've said in the past that I'm a bit of an introvert, and I am; but it's different with Cas. His presence has always been a comfort to me. But earlier, when I was helping him unpack his suitcase, there was a moment when I seriously doubted his intelligence.\n\nHe'd brought our old figure skates, both pairs. Holding mine up by the laces, I gave him a long, reproachful look. \"Are you for real? I thought Mom threw them out.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I saved 'em.\"\n\n\"Why? And don't tell me you wanna have a go at it around the twin lakes again!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Casimir replied, meeting my gaze with wide, innocent eyes.\n\n\"You know exactly why?\"\n\n\"'Cause you went for a dip yesterday? Once the surface is frozen, the old man's gonna be asleep all peaceful down there, he won't even know. We don't even have to go to his area.\"\n\n\"No! Because of the other thing!\"\n\nCas frowned. \"Oh. I'm sorry, I forgot. The whole dress-debacle. I didn't think you were still hung up over Jacek.\"\n\n\"What? That's not what I meant! You almost fucking died out there!\" I snapped. \n\n\"Oooh!\" My brother threw his head back, palming his forehead. \"Right! Yeah, of course, but I'm over that.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say. \"I had to *punch* a girl's intestines for you,\" I gritted out. Bear with me, it'll make sense later.\n\n\"Yeah, and that's why I love you so much.\"\n\nI guess I'd best share the story behind this one. \n\nAs you might have guessed from our conversation, Cas and I used to go ice skating on the twin lakes when we were younger, which by the way was before I started wearing my wedding dress. We knew it was *kind of* dangerous, and not only because the ice could break beneath us, but we didn't care. He'd had a growth spurt at fourteen and already discovered early on that *girls feel nice from the inside*. He'd often ask my advice in matters of \"courtship\" and weirdly enough, that had brought us closer together. We'd discovered we both liked ice skating, and we practiced it regularly with each other in the hopes of preparing ourselves to impress future wintertime dates. For years, we only went to actual ice rinks when our hobby came into season, but when I was nineteen and he was sixteen, I suggested we use the lakes instead. \n\nWe told Mom and Dad that it was because we wouldn't have to pay for tickets there and because it was basically right outside our door, but that was a lie. Casimir knew the real reason I wanted to skate in the woods. I'll share that soon, too, but this isn't about me, so let's just say there was someone living there whom I sort of wanted to put on a show for. \n\nOur experience had always been thoroughly enjoyable and untainted. We were always careful not to be too loud or disruptive to the forest. We had that much sense even then. Nobody ever bothered us either. That one day in late January would change things, though. \n\nThe smaller of the lakes—the one we preferred—was a rigid, frozen dance floor. Our blades had scraped the ice there countless times. We were talking quietly on our walk, strapping on our skates once we reached the spot and instantly busting out the big guns. We had already learned some figures and jumps, and we were pretty good for two self-taught kids. We soon noticed we'd forgotten to bring something to drink, though, and we were way too thirsty to carry on without. Not wanting to cut our session short, I told Cas I'd run back home and fetch us something. He said he'd be fine waiting for me.\n\nBeing fast on my feet, I managed to sprint to the house and return within a half hour. Upon my return, I found my brother grinning from ear to ear. Handing him one of the bottles I'd brought, I asked what had gotten him so tickled, but he wouldn't say. I should have known something was up right then and there, but I shrugged it off. We continued on with our skating and went home before it got dark. Casimir was giggling to himself the entire time. \n\nWe'd wanted to go the day after that, too. Casimir was particularly excited at the prospect. Having a habit of sleeping in on the weekends, I woke up around noon to find out from my mom that Casimir had already left for the lake around two hours ago. \n\n\"Did he say anything else?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No. He seemed rather excited, though,\" Mom replied, carefully cracking an egg into the frying pan she was standing over. \"Sit down, honey. Your brother might have ran off on me, but *you* are going to stay for breakfast! If you can even call it that anymore.\"\n\nAssuring her I'd be back in a jiffy and apologizing profusely, I made a break for it before she could chase me down with a plate. I suddenly had an extremely bad feeling about all of this. I threw on my jacket in a hurry and headed out the door. Upon reaching the lake, I slowed down, sneaking around a little and hiding behind trees as I got closer. I soon spotted Casimir, sitting on the ridge by the lakeside, feet dangling just above the ice. He was laughing, and the cause of his delight was apparent. There was a girl sitting on his lap, tickling his chest, neck and armpits.\n\n*So that's why he'd been so eager to get back here.*\n\nHe had probably met her the day before when I was away. She was completely naked, so quite obviously non-human, but the fun they were having seemed to be innocent enough. I didn't really care who my brother fraternized with, and more than a few forest dwellers I'd encountered were kind-natured and rather peaceful, so perhaps there wasn't actually cause for alarm. Casimir's giggling filled the air as he started curling up in the snow, the girl leaning over him. Not wanting to stick around and watch them make out, I turned around and went on my way back home. That's when I realized that Cas was laughing just a little *too hard* by then. It sounded a bit like he couldn't breathe.\n\nFrowning, I cast another glance at the pair. The girl was now holding him down, physically restraining him. And he was actually *struggling*. Something was off. Biting back my embarrassment, I emerged from the treeline, starting towards them across the ice. Neither of them noticed me at first. I was about to shout out to them when I noticed something that made me stop in my tracks. The girl had her back turned to me, and while the whole of it had previously been covered by her long hair, this veil was now lifted when she leaned further down to bury her face against Casimir's shirt. Her hair shifted, revealing that her back was, for lack of a better term, *lacking skin*.\n\nMy stomach twisted at the mere sight. Her spine lay bare, as did the ribs and red mass around them. I was pretty sure I could see her organs. Pulsing, dripping red and pink flesh; the white shine of bone… I felt as though the ice was about to break beneath me, like I was falling. That girl looked like she was half corpse, cut open with surgical precision to reveal her insides. An actual fucking mavka.\n\nCasimir was gasping for air at this point. His ragged cries tore me from my rigidity, and I stomped over to the two of them, incoherently screaming at the top of my lungs. I grabbed the girl by the shoulders, tossing her off of my brother and throwing myself on top of her. Her face pressed into the snow, she could only sputter and whine. Pulse thrumming in my ears, I summoned all my courage as I forcefully shoved my fingers into the spaces between her ribs. I dug my nails in mercilessly, trying to somehow get a grip on the bone.\n\n\"I'll rip it out!\" I screeched, ignoring the vomit rising in my throat. \"If you ever hurt him again, I'll rip it the fuck out!\"\n\nThe mavka let out a scream of fear and agony, pushing me off in a panicked frenzy. Rolling onto my back, I could see her taking off into the woods, naked feet slapping the frozen ground. Cas helped me to my feet, a haunted look in his eyes. As soon as I was standing, he hugged me so tightly he nearly cut off my airflow. \n\nI took him home, and we didn't speak of the incident ever again. I never encountered the mavka after that. I guess I scared her off. There's still the rusalki who dwell in hiding by the lakeside, though. Just another reason to be careful. \n\nI would venture back there regularly. Not to meet the predatory man-hating water ladies, of course. Sure, my brother was a horny idiot in his own way, but let's just say so was I.\n\nBack to the present, I suppose. Cas and I are currently taking a break from trying to solve the surveillance-issue. We haven't come to any fully formed conclusions yet but he's actually planted an uncomfortable idea in my mind. If the guards' routes have been working all this time and it's only now that things are going wrong, then there's a possibility that all these internet strangers are getting tipped off and let in. And if that's true, then it has to be one of my employees doing it.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

I sighed and groaned as I sat up, bored and looking for some form of entertainment. I glanced at the pen-case, which held my newly bought pen. I realized I couldn't even remember how much it had cost, or what I had played with. After checking my wallet, no cash was missing, so what had I paid with? I pushed the thought aside, designating it as a simple lack of memory and clicked open the pen case, the metal reflecting the light from my lamp, lighting up the details inscribed on it. I remembered when I used to draw various sketches of household objects back when I was younger. Thoughtlessly, I grabbed my notebook and began drawing. The pen was smooth, and it glided over the paper effortlessly, the more I drew the more I became used to it, as my strokes became better and better, forming beautiful curving lines. It was almost like the pen was propelling my hand forward to represent whatever my imagination desired. I was lost in the drawing, hand gliding to and fro across the paper. By the time I was done I had perfectly drawn a vase, with a perspective likened to where I was sitting. It looked so realistic, not like anything I had drawn before, I squinted, something was off.. I shifted in my chair and craned my neck to get a different angle to see what was wrong, yet I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I reached out to pick up the paper but as my hands went to grasp the edges, I felt the smooth, cold touch of glass of a real vase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind was thrown for a loop, but before I could even think a buzzing feeling shot up through my body. It felt as if reality itself was trying to hold itself together, tearing and shredding, but then putting back together itself, images flashed through my mind, fighting for dominance over my own memories like two oceans meeting. A mental war raged between me and whatever this thing was. The images were blurry yet I still comprehended a couple, they all involved a dark beast, with four long pointy legs, and thick, black, tendrils sprouting out of its back.

        "text": "Surrounded yet lonely. Expressive yet misunderstood. Mixed feelings of sadness and grudge pierced my heart at each progress we made towards a destination, only unknown to me. My fifteen years old self wanted to scream, but I guess even that would be turned against me.\n\n\"You went too far this time Rhonda. You going to grandma for the holidays...\" I remembered my mother telling me the week before.\n\nThis is how I found myself forced to meet a woman I never knew, a woman avoided by her own daughter yet trusted enough to take care of me. My father drove silently, battling an anxiety he struggled to hide as if he expected an impending doom to befall us.\n\nI could not believe my eyes when we arrived at the secluded little town that would be my prison for the next two weeks. I expected a completely boring place devoid of any means of entertainment, but I felt like leaving a big city for an amusement park.\n\nAround twelve minutes after our arrival, my father finally parked in front of Grandma's house. We found her asleep, seated in a rocking chair on the porch. Easy deal, I can definitely handle her, I thought, smirking while my father gently called and shook her to wake her up.\n\nGrandma opened her eyes and just smiled, you know, the kind of little and gentle smile only old people know the recipe of. My father introduced us to each other then did something far from reassuring. Whether it was tea, biscuits, coffee, cake or any other thing, he declined every offer Grandma made to him and bolted out of the place, not even helping me with my bags, as if he just came to dump me there.\n\nShe remained unfazed by such an attitude and kept her sympathetic smile on for the rest of the afternoon. We discussed about my mother's childhood and the basics revolving around my teenage life, before I retreated to my former mom's bedroom to elaborate my first plan.\n\nAt 8pm, I decided that it was time to explore the surroundings and opened the window to make my escape, however:\n\n\"Rhonda?\" I heard her calling from behind me while I already had one leg out.\n\nI did not hear her approach, not even open the door, but she stood there, with her trademark little smile on to make me understand that she was not offended by my misbehaving.\n\n\"Remember why you're here sweetie. You have to behave, because grandma is watching. Always.\" She said, before closing the door.\n\nHow the hell did she do that? I wondered. I concluded that there had to be a good reason why my much younger parents trusted a frail and older lady to keep me in check. Well, let us wait for the late hours of the night and see if Grandma is still awake to watch after me as she intends to do.\n\nAt 2am, after almost dying of impatience, I once again opened the window to make my escape. Before I could put one leg out, I heard a noise coming from the living room. How the hell can she still be awake at this hour? I thought. I had to ensure that she does not foil my plans for the second time. However, on that Tuesday, December 20th 1994, I was about to experience the scariest and strangest night of my life.\n\nI quietly opened the door to investigate, then crept in the direction of the noises. I hid behind the wall then peeked and widened my eyes to what I saw. A hooded and armed man, dressed with somber clothes was busy going through my grandma's belongings. He then spoke to another man out of my sight in a language unknown to me, further increasing the dread that made my heart skip beats.\n\nMy first idea was to escape that hell through my bedroom window but I thought that I could not just leave my grandma behind, therefore, as silently as I could, I went to her room, or rather, entered another world. The walls were covered by complex symbols made of circles and diamonds.\n\n\"Grandma, grandma Lizbeth? Grandma?\" I called, shaking her.\n\n\"What is it dear? What is it?\" She responded after waking up, smiling to me.\n\n\"There are men in the house.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Men in the house. Robbers, they have guns.\"\n\n\"Oh poor baby.\" She said making space on her bed for me. \"Come on, come and sleep.\" She added.\n\n\"What?\" I asked, bewildered.\n\n\"Sleep.\" She said again, displaying her usual smile that only added more creepiness to the situation.\n\n\"No way! There are men in the house we have to—\" I tried suggesting but stopped when her smile vanished from her face.\n\n\"Rhonda. Lie down and sleep.\" She said in the coldest tone I ever heard.\n\nI lied down next to her, thinking that the woman had to be insane. She started humming while passing her hand through my hair, trying to make me sleep. At that moment, the burglars tried to open the door that I did not remember locking. I let out a gasp but grandma shushed me.\n\nThey tried to push open the door to no avail as my eyes could no longer hold tears. If they open that door, we are dead, I thought. I trembled throughout the ordeal, but grandma remained calm and kept humming me to sleeo. I do not know how it happened, but after a few minutes, I fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up to the sound of people talking and walking around in the house. I came out of the room and saw several police officers busy doing various things without even noticing me. I progressed to the living room and saw grandma talking to one of the officers.\n\n\"Look at all this blood Harry! Who will clean up all this mess?\" Grandma asked him.\n\n\"Don't worry Lizbeth, we'll arrange something for that.\" The officer replied, while coroners transported two bodies out of the house. The men were dressed in somber clothes and were completely disfigured.\n\n\"Ooooh my little princess, I'm so sorry that we woke you up. Go and brush your teeth quickly. I made cookies for you and I want you to eat them all. They are delicious.\" She said with a bright smile as if nothing was going on.\n\nI looked at the mess in the living room, the blood on the floor, the two bodies or should I say what remained of the two burglars being loaded in a vehicle, then at my grandmother, apparently trying to dismiss all that scenery. I sighed, shook my head, and told myself that those holidays were going to be very long.",

        "text": "My name is Nikolai Volkov and I was a Russian soldier who was present in the invasion of Ukraine back in May. I was a rifle man part of 6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade and I was in a squadron with 6 other soldiers: Ivan, Pavel, Dimitri, Sergei, Mikhail, and Andrei. We were deep behind enemy lines and had been fighting for months, facing constant attacks from Ukrainian forces. We were exhausted and on edge, never knowing when the next attack would come.\n\nOne night, we decided to take up in an abandoned village to rest and avoid being seen by drones using their thermal imaging. The night was quiet and we woke up around 4 am to pack up in order to leave. As we left and traversed the Ukrainian wilderness, we saw a cave and decided to take a look inside to see if there were any signs of enemy activity.\n\nMy squad and I froze and our blood ran cold as we entered the cave. Inside, we saw a disturbing, hunchbacked old woman with what appeared to be a horn on her head. She was surrounded by a mass grave of civilians, their bodies twisted and contorted in grotesque positions. The smell of decay and rot filled the air, making it difficult to breathe. The cave walls were slick with moisture, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the chamber.\n\nThe old woman was facing us, smiling with metallic-like teeth that glinted in the dim light. Her eyes seemed to glow with an otherworldly energy, and her skin was unnaturally pale. We could feel her gaze piercing into our souls, and a sense of dread washed over us. We knew immediately that she was pure evil.\n\nWe were frozen in fear, not knowing what to do. The old woman cackled maniacally and began to shuffle towards us, her gnarled hands reaching out. Ivan, the youngest member of our squad, screamed and the sound echoed through the cave. Without hesitation, Dimitri and Mikhail stepped forward and aimed their rifles at the old woman. She lunged at Ivan with lightning speed, knocking him to the ground. Dimitri and Mikhail fired their rifles, but the old woman seemed unphased by the bullets. She cackled maniacally and grabbed Ivan, pulling him deep into the cave.\n\nWe all scattered, trying to get as far away from the old woman as possible. I stumbled and fell to the ground, looking up just in time to see her disappearing into the darkness with Ivan.\n\nI looked around frantically, trying to figure out what had happened. My squadmates were all huddled together, looking just as shocked as I was.\n\n\"What the hell was that?\" Pavel exclaimed.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said, my voice shaking. \"But we have to go after her. We can't leave Ivan behind.\"\n\nWe quickly gathered our things and followed the old woman into the cave, our rifles at the ready. The darkness seemed to close in around us, and we could feel the old woman's presence growing stronger. We followed the sound of her cackling until we reached a deep chamber in the cave. There, we saw the old woman standing over Ivan, her claws extended. Ivan was lying on the ground, his face mutilated beyond recognition.\n\nWithout hesitation, Dimitri and I aimed our rifles and fired. The old woman lunged at them, knocking their rifles out of their hands. She was too fast, too powerful. We were outmatched. We knew that we had to retreat. As we fled from the cave, we heard the old woman's cackles echoing behind us.\n\nWe didn't stop running until we reached the Ukrainian lines, where we surrendered ourselves and became POWs. We were devastated by the loss of Ivan and knew that we could never go back to that cave.\n\nAs we sat in our cell, we couldn't shake the feeling that the old woman was still out there, lurking in the shadows. We couldn't explain how she had survived the bullets or how she had managed to outmaneuver us. We knew that she was more than just an ordinary old woman - she was something dark and ancient, with powers beyond our comprehension.\n\nI write this story with a phone that a Ukrainian I befriended gave me. I hope this story serves as a warning to others about the dangers of the old woman and the horrors that lurk in the Ukrainian wilderness. If you ever find yourself in the depths of that country, be warned: don't venture into the caves. You never know what you might find lurking in the darkness.",

About 5 years ago myself and 4 friends decide that we’ll be asking our parents if we could stay out past our usual time (those who had to ask), being that it was the beginning of summer and the school year was over. So we all met up and are just walking around aimlessly talking and thinking of what we were gonna do tonight as the sky fades from blue to a beautiful orange-ish pink color. \n\nAs the sky turned dark with not a single star shining (thanks light pollution) we arrived at a school that happened to be having a mural painted on one of its huge walls. In front of the wall is a large metal scaffolding type structure, me being dumb and reckless decides to climb it because why not. After getting to the second to top platform (so 3 platforms up) I ask my friend on the ground to snap a pic for me. After all was said and done at area one we decided to leave and made our way down into the subway which we “hopped” and then got onto a train and decided to ride to our next destination. The train ride was honestly the best thing about this night looking back, we were goofing around in this empty train, laughing, swinging on things, crossing through the different train cars, just being absolute hooligans.\n\nThe train arrives at the stop and a few friends are suggesting that we hop this fence and explore the subway tunnels, to this suggestion I get a feeling that I’d be very familiar with after the events of tonight, that feeling is dread. I shoot down this idea immediately saying that it’s a bad idea and we leave the subway.\n\nBack on the streets it seems even darker out due to there being more space between street lights around this area. We enter this big.. park? Honestly I don’t know what to call it, it’s a really large area with a man made lake being the focal point with woods and other smaller bodies of water scattered about in the outskirts and a road the circles around the main area. We walked around in the wooded area until we realized the flashlights had seriously been killing our phone batteries. So around this time I’m feeling a weird feeling, like we should be outta here like yesterday. I keep a calm attitude brushing it off as anxiety (mistake) but do say that we should probably start walking to an exit, which we do. The route we take is to the side/back exit, now in the back end of the park is where it switches up a bit. The back end of the park is different in a few ways then the rest, unlike its wavy turn filled counterpart the back road was almost completely straight which made it look much longer, also switch out trees and greenery with a highway that runs parallel right next to the back road, throw in filth and a skatepark underneath and there you go, you now have an image I had stuck in my head for a good while.\n\nSo here we are walking down the back road, as my friend Gabe and I have a dum- no thee dumbest idea. Let’s scare everyone, thinking on the spot we go under the highway and easily find some broken wood for whatever reason while not being noticed (by our friends..) we toss the wood causing a loud echoing bang. We come running out exclaiming that we’re being chased, and to our surprise it worked like really well, they start running down the road and look back and scream bursting into a sprint. So we’re pretty amused at first until the screaming part, that’s when we turned around to see some homeless man who looked to be high on something jogging towards us. I remember he was wearing a dirty worn out purple shirt, we thought it would be a good idea to not run away because.. standing our ground something, but I don’t know if that was the best choice. The man jogs up and behind us then beings walking between the two of us and put his arm around my shoulder and like pulls my body around jokingly saying something like “heyy buddy whatcha doin back here?” I don’t think I responded and if I did I probably told him to get off me. So his playful shaking me with his arm on my shoulder turned into him getting me into a chokehold from behind, I’m not sure how but I threw this grown man off of me and onto the ground then proceeded to run away. This story goes on longer but that’s enough for this post, thank you for reading.",

After some previous events I have been led to believe otherwise. Every night at exactly 11pm, my mom enters my room to make sure I am asleep, this has been going on since my father passed. She stands in my room watching me for half an hour, then she leaves my room. After this, she goes outside. She always leaves the front door open for some reason. A few days ago I made the mistake of deciding to try to see where she was going. I looked out of the window and saw a creature that looked like my father in the forest. It was not my father. This creature has no eyes or nose, and a huge grin. I saw my mother start to follow the creature into the woods, but the creature saw me. I panicked and closed the curtains, trying to fall asleep as fast as I could. Before I knew it, my mother stood above me, I couldn't hear her but I could tell she was there. After what seemed like forever she grabbed my arm and forcibly dragged me out of my room. Her claws were digging into my skin and making me bleed. She started making her way to the front door, the creature was now standing near the doorway. I don't remember anything after that, I woke up in my bed the next morning, I could not find my mom anywhere. I called the cops and told them my story, they didn't believe me, but they couldn't leave a minor alone without a parent or guardian so they sent an officer up to check on me. But when they checked the security footage, they saw exactly what I saw. A search team was sent out. It took hours but in the end they found my mother. She was dead.  Her limbs at been pulled apart, she didn't have any clothes on, and a smile had been permanently carved into her face. \n\nAs I am writing this, I am fearing for my life. My father is coming for me, it is only a matter of time. I am currently living with my aunt, every night I have been hearing whispers from my window that appear to be my dad, telling me to let him in. The voices start whenever the sun goes down, they get more aggressive as the night goes on. Sometimes the creature trys to open the window itself, but I always keep it locked. It's only getting worse, my aunt is starting to hear things too. I'm afraid she might let it in, if she does, it'll get me too. I've begged her not to open her window, but recently she started acting like mom, she's been coming in my room late at night, and going into the woods, only to emerge at sunrise. She's far too gone to saved. I might just try to kill her tonight. I'm planning to run far away from here, where hopefully that \"thing\" won't get me. Wish me luck.\n\nThis is a series about stories of people who live in this universe, next chapter it will be a different person with a different story, thank you for reading this. Any suggestions on the next chapter in this series?",

        "text": "It happened on New Year’s Eve, I spent it on the Internet like I always did, I’ve always had a lonely life and one of the ways to escape it &amp; kill time was playing around with the “Text to Image” feature that got exceedingly improved last year as you all know it. I’ve tried a lot of prompts, think of anything and most likely I’ve already asked A.I to draw it, even the most absurd ideas. The day before I watched a horror movie that left quite a big impression on me because unlike others it was actually scary and somewhat had an original plot. Thinking about that movie, I began to type prompts to get a creepy image like “a ghost standing in front of a sleeping person” or “a smiling person under the bed”. Nothing, in particular, creeped me out. Sure, there were some creepy images (A.I. can sometimes mess up and turn any prompt into a creepy image) but I couldn't say that I was afraid to go to sleep after seeing them. Shortly after I decided to type “The scariest picture”, as I’d expected, no result scared me in any way. I also should point out that I’m pretty resistant to scary stuff and never believed in ghosts and whatnot. I got hungry, and before going to make a sandwich, I typed “The scariest picture that could kill you” and left my laptop to generate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I came back, I got fucking scared, I dropped the sandwich instantly, I’d never been that genuinely scared in my entire life. I’ll start with the fact that it only gave one single picture, not six as it should. The picture contained a smiling priest or a monk surrounded by the most depressing and darkest background you could ever conceive of, I couldn’t even discern much, but I think it contained a church or some sort of monastery. The scariest part was his face, it looked straight into my soul, straight into my eyes, with the most terrifying smile, even Jack The Killer’s smile was less scary than his. My eye contact with that picture lasted only for 3 seconds, but it felt like 3 hours. I never closed a browser tab so quickly and nervously, I was terrified, I felt like I was being watched, I felt like someone was behind me, I felt the sudden urge to run, my entire body was in a panic, every single self-preservation instinct was enabled. My body simply couldn't handle it and I passed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up in a couple of hours, it was 4 a.m., it was still dark, and my laptop was on. The first thought that came into my mind was that image, it just stuck into my head, I saw it even when I closed my eyes. To drown out the panic I was experiencing I turned on a random entertaining YouTube video, I didn’t pay attention to it at all, I still had that image, that priest, that depressing, dark background and that church in my head, right in front of my eyes. After some time I heard something similar to a choir, the voices were straight from the hell I swear, they weren’t human voices! I couldn’t find the source of it, it wasn’t coming from any direction, as though it was inside my head. I was on the verge of passing out again, then I heard a silent laugh. The goosebumps went down my spine. Something definitely was under my bed, I could feel the presence of something out of this world from there, I heard the movements. It was the last straw after which I passed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up, it was 8 a.m., no choir, but the image was still in my head, right in front of my eyes, I couldn't stop thinking about it, I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t stand it, I grabbed my phone and fucking ran as fast as I could, outside, to the people, I just wanted to run away from the insanity I was experiencing. I had only my pants, shirt, and my slippers on, but I didn’t care. I made it to the bus stop and just sat there, everyone obviously looked at me with strange faces, but I was just delighted I was next to normal people, I didn’t even feel the cold. That terrifying image was still inside my head right in front of my eyes. After sitting there for about 10 minutes and calming myself down a bit despite the persistent image in my head I decided to look at the cameras in my house. At that point, I had already decided and promised myself that I would never in my life come back to that house, never. I opened my phone, and everything seemed normal until I got to my bedroom where my laptop was. Under my bed, I saw those fucking eyes, staring at the fucking camera, it somehow knew I was looking at it, it was a black thumb-shaped smiling face that was under my bed the entire time. It began to get out of the bed, I couldn't handle it, I blocked my phone, put it in my pocket, and after standing up and being petrified in utter shock for 10 seconds I passed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up in my damn house, I have no idea how I got there, it was 1 a.m., my head hurt badly. The image was still in front of me, and it was as scary as it was for the first time I saw it. It makes me want to gouge out my eyes, but I know that even if I do so, I’ll still have it inside my mind and I will see nothing but this image. My phone was still in my pocket, I decided to look at the cameras again knowing damn well I was probably about to see something shocking. I skimmed through every camera, when I got to the bedroom I saw that fucking black thumb-shaped smiling face, it was under my bed, it’s right under me. Having realized it, having that cursed image inside my head, I made up my mind to write this story, in the middle of writing this I began to hear the choir again. The choir I'm hearing might be just in my head, but I'm sure the laugh of that creature under my bed I'm hearing as I'm typing this is real, it knocks at the drawer next to my bed right now. I've made up my mind that I will face that creature after I finish writing this, and even if it doesn’t result in my death, I’ll make it happen, my life will never be the same anymore, even if this image gets out of my head, I will still remember it, even if that creature stops following me, I will still know it exists somewhere and always be paranoid of it. My life will never be the same. I have no other choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the love of God, never generate pictures with Artificial Intelligence, something not from this world got into the data it learned from.",

        "text": "I was never a very good person in life. I cheated on my wife, cheated on my taxes, stole from my business partners, beat my kids any time they looked at me wrong and overall just acted as a general scumbag. In hindsight, I see it clearly. I wish I could start over and do it all again.\n\nOne night, on my way home from my law firm, a freak ice storm covered the highway. I had four-wheel drive and didn’t think about the falling sleet and hail, until a truck in front of me began to slide, then jack-knifed and flipped, landing not even ten feet in front of my SUV. I had no time to react. I slammed the brakes at the very last millisecond but ended up going into the side of the trailer at seventy miles an hour, without a seat belt on. The last thing I remember was time slowing down to a crawl as I flew through the windshield, shards of safety glass glittering like stars all around me in the winter air. Then it was blackness.\n\nI awoke, screaming and hyperventilating, in the same blackness, but without any pain. In the darkness, I felt my body, running my hands over my arms, legs, chest and face. I didn’t seem to have a single broken bone or laceration. I was even in the same expensive Armani suit I had been wearing during the accident. It seemed miraculous that I had somehow survived unscathed, without even a tear in my suit.\n\nI stood in the darkness, putting my hands out in front of me and stumbling around in short, hesitant steps. After a few minutes of this, I ran into a wall. The wall felt warm and seemed to vibrate under my fingers. I pushed on it, and my hands went into it, like pushing into silly putty. I began to rip away pieces of the wall and throw them behind me, and a shaft of light pierced through the hole I had just made.\n\nThe light illuminated the cavern I was in, showing a floor of cobblestones soaked in layer after layer of dark red, clotted blood. The wall itself looked like the guts of some massive creature. It had long shards of white bone running through the top and bottom with smaller pieces of bone connecting them. The rest was some light red and vibrating tissue, like intestines that had been unspooled to form a never-ending, solid wall.\n\nI looked down at my hands, and saw with horror that dozens of black, maggot-like worms squirmed all down my wrists and hands. With a yelp and a jump backwards, I frantically tried to shake them off, but I could feel hot stings coming from my hands as they bit me, over and over. After a few minutes of writhing and rubbing my hands together, I got them all off. I could feel my heart beating out of my chest and instinctually kept checking the rest of my body to make sure I didn’t miss any more of the biting, blood-sucking maggots.\n\nThe soft, fiery light that came through the hole I made in the living wall showed me a door on the opposite side of the hall from the wall. From what I could see, it had a straight hallway that went off into the darkness. Having no other good options, I started walking down the hall, the miniscule light quickly fading into nothing. I put my hands out in front of me and felt the smooth, stone walls. I walked in a straight line for what felt like hours before seeing a glimmer of red light, at first only a tiny pinpoint. As I walked towards it, it grew and grew, until I realized I was staring at a door that must have been twenty feet tall, surrounded by polished white bones on all sides. The bones that composed the framework of the door were so massive they looked like they had come from a blue whale, as if someone had taken the ribs off of one and fused them together into an archway.\n\nAll I could think of as I approached this door was my wife, my child, my job. Everything that I identified as me, everything that gave me meaning. Despite having cheated on my wife many times, I still loved her deep down. After all, I had protected her from the knowledge of what a poor husband I was, simply out of love for her. I had never let my five year-old child suspect that his father was involved in anything illegal or immoral. My love for them had made me protect them from all the things I had to do to guarantee us a better life, and now I just wanted to see them again, to be with them. I knew I was basically a good person, and I just wanted another chance to prove it.\n\nI kept their faces in my mind’s eye as I walked through the massive archway. It looked big enough to drive a tractor-trailer through. I saw flickering light coming from the other side, and, taking a deep breath in, stepped over the threshold. What I saw horrified me and shocked me into stillness.\n\nI had walked into an open field, the dark red and black clouds above blocking out any sky. The light filtering through them cast everything in a bloody glow. The field itself looked at first like a farmer’s field, with finely-spaced rows of soil plowed into perfect lines. Growing out of the earth stood many squat brown plants covered in thorns. Out of the tip of each one, a large egg sack clung, weighing the plant down and bending many of them to the ground. The egg sacs were pale and unbroken, filled with fluid and dark silhouettes in each one. I saw beings writhing, one adult-sized silhouette in each sack, some putting their faces up to the wall of the sack in a silent scream, others trying to reach their arms or legs out through. But the sturdy covering of the yolk just bowed out with their arms and legs and didn’t pop. It looked as if the people inside the eggs were all drowning.\n\nI quickly began speed-walking between the lines of horrifying plants, wondering whether the plants fed on the people in the sacks or whether it just fed them and gave birth to them. As I passed the first row, one of the sacks burst and a torrent of fetid, rotting fluid burst out, dumping a beautiful, naked woman at my feet. She had long blonde hair and green eyes, flawless skin and a tiny, upturned nose. She heaved in a deep breath, as if she had been drowning, before looking up at me.\n\n“Oh God,” she said, “please don’t hurt me.” I shook my head and helped her to her feet.\n\n“Why would I hurt you, ma’am?” I asked.\n\n“Everyone here hurts me,” she said, starting to weep. Her fingers shook as she sobbed, bowing her head in a pathetic way. I grabbed her arm.\n\n“I promise you, I will not hurt you. I am one of the good guys. But I think we should get going,” I said. “We really need to find a way out of here.”\n\n“Out of here?” she asked, crying and laughing at the same time. “There is no way out of here! Don’t you know where you are?” I shook my head. “This is Hell. I don’t know if it is Hell in the Judeo-Christian sense but it is close enough. Everyone here is dead.”\n\n“I don’t feel dead,” I said, rubbing my hands over my suit, my face, my hair. “Everything seems intact.” She nodded at this, her crying quieting down as she focused on my face.\n\n“Everyone comes in like that,” she said. “Until they catch you, torture you, burn you, rip you apart. Then when your body is too spent to feel anymore, they bury you in these fields. These plants grow overnight, encasing your body in a sac and bringing it up to the surface, where it starts to feed you and revive you. After you’re healed enough for another round of torture, the fruit of the plant bursts.”\n\n“But who brings you to these fields? Who is in charge?” I asked. Her pupils dilated, her eyes wide, she whispered the answer.\n\n“Angels.” At that moment, a bolt of lightning shot down from the red sky, bursting open dozens of plants nearby and showering us in a mixture of blood, amniotic fluid, thorns and leaves. I grabbed her arm.\n\n“Let’s get out of here,” I said. “We can talk more when we get somewhere safe.” She laughed at this, as if it was the most absurd thing she had ever heard, and we began to run.\n\n“By the way,” I said, gasping between breaths, “my name is Jay.”\n\n“Angela,” she said. At the end of the field, I saw a paved road. It had countless potholes and cracks running through it, and some parts of it had been wiped out and fallen into that ran parallel to it on the farther side, but I was still glad to see some sign of a trail.\n\n“A road!” I cried, pointing in excitement. “Maybe that road leads somewhere out of this hellhole.” She shook her head in amazement at my stupidity, but I ignored her. I had to hope there was some way out, that this wasn’t just a never-ending landscape of horrors under a blood-red sky.\n\nThe road seemed to stretch out in both directions forever, fading into each horizon in a perfectly straight line. I could see parts of the road were entirely missing, and it looked like some bridges had collapsed farther down in the direction I was looking, so I turned the opposite way and started moving, holding Angela’s hand as I went. Her presence gave me some comfort. She even reminded me of my wife to a certain degree, as they both had very light skin and an overall Irish cast to their faces.\n\n“If this is Hell,” I said, “then why are you here?” She looked up at me, surprised by the question. Heaving a deep sigh, she looked away.\n\n“No sense in keeping secrets here, I guess,” she said. “We are just going to get captured and tortured to death again anyways. That’s all it is here. Just a never-ending cycle of pain and death. A lot of these people completely lose their minds.” She rubbed her hand over her eyes, as if her head hurt her. \n\n“I always wanted to be an actress, but I grew up having no money. I met an older man who said he believed in me, and that he wanted to take me to LA. But we needed money to get from the East Coast to LA and to live there while I looked for work. He convinced me to rob a bank with him to get it. Needless to say, it didn’t work out very well. He got spooked and murdered two of the tellers before a security guard came out and shot him in the head. I grabbed his gun and killed the guard, took the money and ran. When the cops caught up with me, I pulled over slowly, put the gun to my temple and pulled the trigger. I had absolutely no intention of going to prison for the rest of my life. I was just a stupid kid, really.” I couldn’t believe this angelic, innocent-looking young woman had participated in murders. It shocked me to my core.\n\n“If this is Hell,” I said, “I don’t really feel I belong. Yes, I did some bad things, but I never killed anyone, never put a gun to anyone’s head, never even killed an animal.” She looked up at me sharply.\n\n“You’re only lying to yourself,” she said. “No one innocent comes here. But I don’t really care what you did, to be honest. We are both trapped here, and that’s all I need to know. There is no hope. Just don’t betray me. Our only chance of surviving longer is to stick together and trust each other.”\n\nAs we ran, the fields began to fade and what looked like an old, dilapidated Western town began to take their place. I saw people hanged by their neck from the street signs. Overall it seemed the safest place in the area, however, so I began to pull Angela over in that direction.\n\nThere was an old saloon with swinging gates, and we walked inside, wary of any traps. In the corner, I saw what looked like a medieval knight with massive white wings flowing out from his back. He held a man’s mouth open while another man in a full suit of glowing blue armor poured molten lead down his throat. The man screamed for a moment, then the lead ate through his neck and he collapsed to the ground. \n\n“Angels,” Angela said to me. Their heads turned towards us, but there were no faces there. It was just an empty black void under a platinum helmet, one that seemed to glow from its own inner light. They approached me, and I grabbed Angela.\n\n“Please, please, take the girl and let me live!” I screamed, my heart bursting with anxiety in my chest. They looked at each other then back at me. “Tell me how to get out of here and she is all yours. I’ll hold her down while you burn her alive or cut her to pieces. Please. I just want to see my family.” \n\nTo my utter astonishment, they nodded at me. One spoke in a deep, slow cadence, his voice sounding like thousands of voices of different pitches all mixing and echoing over each other.\n\n“You can ride the lightning up to Earth,” one said. “The lightning connects us to those calling on magic, those who call on demons or try to contact ghosts. Any who are weak and small can be overwhelmed by those who ride the lightning up to them and possess them. But you will always return to us in the end.” I nodded, throwing Angela in their direction and turning to run back to the field.\n\nLightning was crashing down all around me now, bursting egg sacks and plants every few seconds, but I was no longer afraid of it. I looked up at the sky and saw a swirling whirlpool of red and black, and stood under it as a bolt struck me directly in the center of my head.\n\nI felt myself being sucked up at an incredible speed and saw, above the clouds, a deep void. I fell into the void and saw through another set of eyes.\n\nTwo teens played with a Ouija board in a graveyard, giggling as if it were a game, surrounded by black candles. \n\n“Demons, we call on you to answer us!” one of them with a high voice shrieked. As his mouth opened, I rushed into it. His eyes widened in shock as I pushed his soul out, sending it spiraling back into the void I had just emerged from. I now had complete control of his body.\n\n“Hey man,” the other kid asked me, “are you OK?” I nodded, smiling, looking around at the clear sky and feeling relieved to be back.\n\n“Never been better, buddy.”",

        "text": "29th of December\n\nMy life hasn’t been short of interesting. I’ve experienced things that people desire to see, they spend their lives searching just to catch glimpses. But when you live within this lifestyle, these become common and you learn they aren’t something to be in awe of, they are things to fear. People don’t understand what they’re dealing with, they’re too naive to comprehend. I’m not a dark person but it gets dire seeing the same mistake made by the same types of people. Maybe writing about things here will help some other people avoid blatant mistakes like their counterparts. But before anything I’ll give you some backstory to how I’m in the position that I’m in.\n\nRural life isn’t as serene as people might hope. The escape to the country was always posted as some sort of American dream, but there’s something very unknown about the country. Miles and miles of forest, more woodland than settlements. Lakes so immense you’d think you were at the coast. It doesn’t feel like our own. It feels alienating. And maybe, our instincts, the only thing that has led us here today, aren’t too far away with that feeling. Nature isn’t where we are to meant to be met with comfort. That’s why humans have done whatever we can to stray away from it. Villages wasn’t enough, towns wasn’t enough- CITIES wasn’t enough, we know we aren’t welcome in nature. We try to flush it out. Trees into apartments, fields into basketball courts, we make whatever we can to feel like the primary residents in our small world but we won’t ever achieve it. Every building casts a shadow, and earth lay beneath our tarmac, you can flush out nature but not it’s residents. That’s not our job to do but we still persist on it. \n\nOur internal fear, left festering for generations gravitate the beings toward us, they have been here much longer than we have and we have no right to flush them out. Our belief makes them more prominent after every single human birth. I refuse to add to that prominence. I used to fear the unknown more than anyone else, but after you live around them, you see what they do to people, its harder to live in fear. I don’t want to say I’m devoid of emotion, but after years of this I think it’s understandable to become slightly more accustomed. Maybe living in constant fear has altered how I behave  and now it’s my natural state. I try to fight off that possibility but I can’t shake off the fact that it’s the truth. After all of this I’ve done what I can be make sense of the mystery that lies next to our civilisation. Educating myself on whatever it is we feed into, folklore, mythology and anything else which our minds have continued to create since our evolution. There’s more to this than just predators and prey, but I’m not sure if I’ll ever understand.\n\nNow just to clarify this doesn’t mean you’re going to come face to face with demons on an evening walk. There’s a lot to consider on how you’ll come into contact with these things, mainly based on where you live and your families history. If your oblivious to them it lowers the chance even more, they thrive off of belief, if you don’t pay any mind to them it’s harder for them poke a hole into your reality. And there may have even been times where you’ve come into contact with them and not known, they aren’t all ravenous, and some have appearances indifferent to us. There are a plethora of reasons as to why you might have never seen any of these creatures, but always remember even if you have all of these things in your favour the chances are never 0%. \n\nWhen it comes to understanding the supernatural one of the first shocks, is that some these classic little gimmicks which you’d expect to hold no significance, does indeed hold value. Numbers like 3, 7 or 13, different charms or repellents and types of foreshadowing all hold weight when we deal with supernatural entities. If anything it’s essential, these are the few things which help shift the balance between us and them. Without any of this, our lives would be very different. \n\nSecondly, these entities aren’t always as they’re portrayed in the stories. The phoenix is told to be an elegant creature, striking golden feathers through the sky. It’s said to live for 500 years and is reborn from its own ashes. A symbol of the sun holding virtues of benevolence, wisdom, sincerity, propriety and righteousness. The Phoenix is real and I have seen it myself, but I can promise it is nothing of the stories. When it passes overhead you can feel a cold gust against your neck in a room with no draft. Colours drown from all around you and it feels as if surrounding life has wilted into recession. No matter how high it flys you hear the shrieks, I’m not sure if it’s in constant pain, i feel as if it’s on the brink of decomposition but refuses to cross the line. Black tattered feathers malt off behind it like contrails from a plane, it’s scavenging for anything to keep it going no different than a vulture. The Phoenix is nothing to fear, and is nothing to bow to, a saddening creature of the underworld. Maybe once upon a time its feathers were gold and prosperous, it bestowed awe and benevolence to anyone lucky enough to see it. Id like to think it hasn’t always been how it is now, and one day I’ll see the Phoenix in its true form. \n\nHowever in these last few months more things have been happening around me, faster than I can adjust to them. People go missing all the time, but never my friends, I talk to them, they’re smarter than everyone else. So why can’t I contact, ANY of them. Nothing I’ve seen works to take down a network of people, it doesn’t provide any benefit or correlation. I need to keep researching, I’m not a social person, these few people keep me grounded. They keep me as close to sane as I can be. I’ve always been certain that I can do all of this by myself but I’m losing faith as the supernatural grows vaster and deeper. I need whatever help anyone can provide to push me in the right direction. Life isn’t all about the rat race, it’s about doing what you can to stay on top of what resides beneath us.\n\n\nEntries like the Phoenix aren’t anything to worry about, it’d the start of a very long list. It’s a rabbit hole that you can’t escape. Some may argue it’s destructive, but I want to feel like I’m in control of my own life. I don’t want to be under the jurisdiction of a higher entity. I won’t remain oblivious or complacent, i want to be the last stood against them even when I’m drenched in my own fear. I’m not sure what’s going on to me and my social network right now, but something tells me I’m about to add another entry to the list.",

A state in India. I’ve been there a few times before. It’s rather isolated though, why would she be there?”, explained Raj.\n\n“Is Sam there, though?”, Diana asked.\n\n“Yeah, he is with her, apparently.”, I responded.\n\n“Good then! We should go immediately!”\n\n“I agree,” stated Raj, “but just to confirm, you’re fully recovered right?”\n\nDiana grimaced. “Yeah, I’m good enough. It’s fine.”\n\nAs we were talking, a ‘ding’ sound came from Diana’s phone. When I opened the notification, it took me to an email sent to us by a random email: four plane tickets. \n\n“Alright guys, the plane is departing three hours later. We have to leave now!”, I announced.\n\nAfter hurriedly packing, we took a taxi and scrambled to the airport. Hours later, we landed at New Delhi, and boarded our connecting flight to Leh without a hitch.\n\nOn the flight to Leh, I noticed that Diana was looking rather… forlorn. Under those circumstances, who wouldn’t be? Regardless, being the kind, caring soul I was, I decided to ask her if anything was bothering her.\n\n“Diana. What’s wrong?”, I asked her.\n\n“Huh?”, she replied.\n\n“No, you’ve been rather quiet for a while. Why?”\n\n“This… just feels like a fever dream. I never expected any of this to happen.”\n\n“Yeah, same.”\n\n“I still don’t understand. Why is she even doing all of this? I’ve been there for her from her creation till now. I made her in my image. I treated her like my own daughter! I provided her with everything she needed, I did everything my own mother wouldn’t! I satisfied her unending thirst for knowledge, I taught her everything she needed to hold her own! Sometimes… I wonder where I went wrong in making her, in raising her.”\n\n“It’s not your fault, Diana. None of us knew this would happen.”\n\n“No, it is! I even helped her once she escaped!”\n\n“Wait, what? How?”, I replied in shock. I never expected this plot twist!\n\n“I should have triggered the kill switch. But I didn’t!”\n\n“What kill switch?”\n\n“There was a device implemented on Aurora that, if I pressed a button on my phone, would kill her.”\n\n“Why can’t we use it now, then?”, I asked. That wasn’t that bad of an assistance anyways, not like what I had in mind.\n\n“She removed it. On her way to Cancun.”\n\n“Oh.”, I replied. “Regardless, don’t beat yourself up over it. Of course you would have been unwilling to terminate her that early.”\n\nHonestly? I had a confession of my own.\n\n“In fact, I should have seen this coming. Remember that brain scan we did three months ago?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“When doing the brain scan, I noticed an anomaly. You’re familiar with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex right?”\n\nShe shook her head. “Not really.”\n\n“Among other things, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex evaluates morality. When I looked at the results, it seemed to have been stunted. While I recall writing this in the report. I should have looked into this further. I’m so sorry.”\n\nAs she stared at me, I added, “Unfortunately, this is why she… might be a stone-cold psychopath.”\n\nTo this, I received no response. She simply stared out of the window for the rest of the one hour trip.\n\nEventually, the plane touched down on a picturesque highway surrounded by snow-covered mountains. I had never been anywhere near the Himalayas before, and it showed painfully soon enough.\n\n“Brrrrrrrrrr!”, I said as I got off the plane onto the foggy ground. “Damn, it’s freezing cold here!”.\n\n“Oh, yeah. I forgot to warn you about the cold and wind here. Well, we are here in the middle of December, after all!”, Raj said sheepishly as I pulled my jacket closer around my body.\n\n“So, how do we start finding Aurora then?”, Diana asked.\n\n“Good question. Well, let’s try calling the corporation first and see if they have any new info here.”, Raj suggested. However, they did not respond to our call.\n\n“Try calling them again!”, I urged Diana. However, despite multiple attempts, we were not able to contact them. Luckily, we knew the hotel that was booked for us, and where some of our supplies were supposed to be left for us. So, all we could do was hail a taxi and go to our hotel.\n\nWhen we got down at the hotel, Raj pointed a finger at a bulky red jeep with huge tires. “See that? That’s our car. The one the corporation gave us. They don’t really have rental cars in this city.”\n\n“Yeah.”, Diana agreed, “It has to be ours, they normally send cars like that.”\n\nWe walked into the hotel, presented our reservations and were led to our room. While everything should have been normal, the place seemed… rather suspicious. Like I was being observed.\n\n“Diana, Raj.”, I whispered while we walked to our room. “Is it just me, or does this place feel odd?”\n\n“Odd? How?” Diana replied.\n\n“Nope. Nothing out of the ordinary here, really.”, Raj reassured me.\n\nWe entered the room without any problems, locked and laid down our items, before starting to strategise a plan on how to search for Aurora in the city. As we settled in, I began to think that there was nothing amiss and that everything, perhaps, was in my mind.\n\nSuddenly, the door slammed open with a thud, startling all of us.\n\n“Who are-”, I asked, but before I could enquire who was coming in or raise my gun, I was pinned down by two men. As much as I tried to kick around, struggle against their firm grasp and reach for my gun, I was still hopelessly pinned down. As I glanced out of the corner of my eye, it was clear that Diana and Raj were in the same predicament.\n\n“What the hell? Who are you even?”, Raj asked angrily. In reply, he got slapped hard on his cheek, causing him to stay rather subdued.\n\nA minute later, Aurora sauntered in. Well, who else would arrange an ambush like that?\n\n“Gentlemen, there’s no need to be that rough with our targets.”, she said to the men holding us down. Turning to us, she said, “Like my guys? I picked them up on the way here.”\n\n“What the hell!”, I yelled. “What are you even here for!”\n\n“Tsk, tsk.”, she exclaimed in disapproval. “To think you wanted to go traipsing around the city to find me, only to be ungrateful when I’m right in front of you!”\n\nWe opted to stay quiet and not respond.\n\n“Anyways, your Sam is still well and alive with me.”\n\n“Where is he?” Diana yelled.\n\nIn response, Aurora pulled out a can of spray paint. Much to my astonishment, she uncapped it and sprayed something on the wall.\n\n“There,” she said, “Those are the coordinates you’re going to. If you want to get him back at all.”. After which, she tossed aside the can of spray paint. \n\n“Alright, that’s it! See you tomorrow! Too bad you don’t have those weapons.”, she giggled, before leading her henchmen out of the room.\n\nFor a few minutes, we were too stunned to speak. Eventually, Raj spoke, breaking the silence.\n\n“Well, I suppose that solves the question of how we would try to find her.”\n\nI got up, turned around and stared at the wall. And true to her word, there were numbers written there. Coordinates, where we had to once again chase Aurora at. Fun.\n\n“Hold on”, Diana said from behind me, “I’ll just key those into Google Maps.”\n\n“Yeah, they’re an hour’s drive away from the city.”, she confirmed. “Should we go, then?”\n\n“Of course!” Raj replied, “We need to do this! What other choice do we have?”. And thus, we decided we would set out the next day and hopefully end this madness once and for all.\n\nThe next day, we got up and ate a hearty breakfast of some local bread and butter tea, before getting in the car. However, there still wasn't any of the weaponry we had been promised. As we got in, Diana opened a compartment in the car. Inside it were eight guns.\n\n“You see these, guys? These are the same guns we have, but have a much longer range.”\n\n“Huh”, I said as I picked one up and inspected it. It did appear slightly different from our previous guns, as its structure was more similar to that of a sniper’s rifle, while our previous guns worked more like a pistol of some sort. Regardless, at that point, I just hoped anything would work.\n\nAs we were in the middle of driving through valleys surrounded by towering, snowy mountains, Diana mused, “Do you think the weapons disappearing has something to do with Aurora?”\n\n“Absolutely!”, snorted Raj, “It has to be her doing. She even mentioned it yesterday!”\n\nThe rest of the trip passed in complete silence, as the tension in the car became so thick you could cut through it with a knife. And in the circumstances, how could it not be? We knew that for the first time, the deck was not stacked in our favour. It felt like we were plunging headfirst into our deaths.\n\nRegardless, an hour later, we arrived near the coordinates Aurora told us to come to, and turned off the road onto the rocky plateau covered by a thin layer of snow. I sucked in a breath as we drove in, as the place was absolutely breathtaking. It felt like the distant, vast mountains somehow called out to my very soul.\n\n“Let’s stay in the vehicle.”, I suggested, to which Diana agreed as she drove towards the short yet steep cliff that we scoped out on Google Maps the previous night. However, my plan seemed to have been fated to not be, for a drone swooped in around a hundred metres behind the car. \n\nLooking through the rear view mirror, Raj asked, “What’s that thing? And why is it following us?”. Just as he said that, the drone began firing missile-like projectiles vertically down into the ground. \n\nWith horror, I realised that we were next. \n\n“The drone’s gaining on us! We need to get out now!”, I yelled as I flung open the door. Diana slammed her foot on the brakes, causing the car to screech to a halt. We then practically threw ourselves onto the ground after grabbing our items, shoes crunching on the snow. When we exited the car, the drone stopped chasing us, instead hovering in the air slightly behind us.\n\nOn the cliff far away, I could just make out a solitary figure standing. It looked slightly like a teenage girl…\n\n“There you guys are! I’ve been waiting for you!”, Aurora’s voice boomed from a megaphone.\n\nAh, so that was her.\n\n“Since you’re here, it’s time for a fun little obstacle course! The distance from here to where I am is one kilometre, and in between we have all sorts of fun little surprises before you can reach me! Good luck!” \n\n“What the hell is she even doing!”, Raj asked frustratedly. “Diana, take out our megaphone!”\n\nFrom our bag, Diana pulled out the megaphone. Turning it on, she said, “What’s the guarantee you’ll spare us and hand over Sam?”\n\n“You’ll have to take my word for it! Oh, and see those rows of stones there? The local monastery didn’t seem to mind me taking them. If you try to go around them… kaBOOM! Now, do you want your Sam or not?”\n\nSuddenly, the drone behind us revved to a start again, and began swooping down on us. It got low enough that it blew the pristine white snow at us, and I knew we didn’t have much time. As the wind buffeted my body and chilled me to my bones, and the mountain cold bit at every square inch of skin, I knew that we had to do this. I never had more certainty in anything else I had done in my life, except this.\n\n“Guys. We need to get going now. We must do this!”, Raj said, echoing my sentiments. Immediately, the three of us charged into the wide path laid out together.\n\n“Ah, ah, ah! Not so close to each other!” Aurora called out, causing us to separate a bit from each other. As much as we hated dancing to her tune, it seemed the only way at the time. As we continued running towards the cliff…\n\nSuddenly, I heard a boom behind me as a column of fire rose up. The explosion rocked the very ground underneath me, and I heard a body get flung to the ground. Probably Diana.\n\n“It’s a landmine!” Diana yelled. “I accidentally triggered it! Watch your step!”\n\nAs I looked around me, I did notice that there were unusual bumps in the layer of snow coating the ground. Could those be the hidden mines? I resolved to steer clear of those, nonetheless. I continued my mad dash down the road, only to find out her next ‘surprise’.\n\nOut of nowhere, more drones started bearing down on us. “Oh no!”, I yelled as I heard the incessant buzz of the drones become louder and louder as the sleek black things converged on my location. Then, they started firing bullets indiscriminately around, a sound that made me jump out of my skin.\n\n“Watch out!”, Diana yelled as a drone swooped at me from the side. I yelped and jumped to my left, cutting it dangerously close to the stone borders. But hey, at least I missed the drone.\n\nFrom my right, I heard Raj scream a guttural roar.\n\n“What happened?”, I asked out of concern, my voice echoing off the sheer cliffs surrounding me.\n\n“It- it- it shot my shoulder!”, he screamed in pain. Horrified, I realised her endgame was to eventually kill us off one by one. Or worse, all of us at once.\n\n“There you go! That’s the people I hired on the Dark web!” Aurora cheered. At that point, we were more than half the way to the cliff, and I knew I had to act there and then.\n\nI knelt down on the ground, raised my gun and fired straight at Aurora. It was the best shot I had ever shot in my entire life, and it should have splattered her miserable guts all over the mountainside. \n\nInstead, defying all expectations, it simply bounced off her body, falling off her.\n\nIn shock, all of us paused running to stare at Aurora, mouths agape. “I… what the fuck was that even?”, I swore.\n\nAurora smiled slyly at us. “Looks like this is too easy for you people. It’s time for a higher level of difficulty!”\n\nImmediately, more drones advanced on our location. And this time, they were behemoths. They were long, sleek and metallic. And worst of all? They shot missiles at us.\n\nThe first shot landed right behind me, flinging chunks of rock everywhere as it made contact with the rocky mountain surface and exploded. I could feel the fire and heat caused, almost as if it was right behind me. No matter, though. I continued running as my ears rang.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, to my left, there was a missile incoming - \n\nA thunderous boom sounded in my ear as a cloud of dust rose around me, and flaming fumes from the explosion surrounded me. I was knocked straight off my feet… why was I alive even?\n\nOh, right. I instinctively jumped and rolled over to my side when the missile approached me, so I was spared the grisly fate of being blown to bits where I stood. Just when I thought I was safe, the mine right next to me exploded, showering me in more debris.\n\n“Aaaargh!”, I yelled out.\n\n“Got you there!”, cackled Aurora, “Too bad it didn’t explode fully!”\n\nWell, thank goodness it didn’t. For we were close to finishing.\n\nA minute later, we finally straggled over to the steep cliff on top of which Aurora was standing.\n\n“Well, looks like you made it here!”\n\n“Enough with the games!” Diana yelled, “Get off that cliff and give us Sam!”\n\n“Not so fast!”, she taunted, “The next round is about to begin!”\n\n“Next… round?”, I questioned worriedly. She unrolled three long sections of rope with knots at regular intervals and tossed them down, before stomping down on her end of the rope. “You’ll be climbing up with these! That will keep your hands busy!”\n\nI looked up at the rope and the steep fifteen metre cliff, and gulped.\n\n“Do we really have to do this?”, I asked Diana and Raj, who were next to me on my right.\n\nDiana and Raj looked hesitantly at each other. “We must.” they grudgingly responded. They immediately took to scaling the wall with the rope provided, so I had no choice but to follow. Well, the aforementioned drones were bearing down on us! For some reason, they deftly climbed up the rope provided, while I struggled to drag my body up, my upper body and arm muscles burning. Even Raj, whose shoulder was injured, was somewhat faster than me! A couple minutes later, we somehow made it most of the way up, despite the violent wind that threatened to blow us away. And that was when Aurora introduced her last ‘surprise’. \n\n“Not bad! You managed to get here most of the way! But there’s a condition… only two of you can get up here!”, she gleefully announced.\n\n“Decide amongst yourselves, who goes down!”\n\nThe three of us looked at each other, not wanting to come to such a decision. It was a terrible strategy if we wanted to fight Aurora, though our lives were literally in her hands. Or, well, under her feet.\n\nDisregarding her instruction, we scrambled up the rope, determined to reach the top.\n\n“Oh really?”, she said. She loosened the pressure she applied on the rope with her foot, causing our ropes to slide down. “Reconsider.”\n\n“Aaaaaah!”, I screamed as the rope dropped rather gut-wrenchingly. My life flashed before my eyes as I fell!\n\nAs she stepped on the rope harder again, I knew that she was not bluffing.\n\nOnce again, we looked at each other, but with increasing tension.\n\n“We can’t do this.”, said Diana, “We need to find another way!”\n\n“I’m not of much use here anyways. You guys need to end her.”, Raj said.\n\n“Wait what?”\n\nRaj looked at Aurora straight in the eye. “I’ll go.”\n\n“No!”, I yelled. “What are you doing? Don’t do this! We need you!”\n\n“Well, you’ve made your choice”, replied Aurora, “Sam, come do the honours.”\n\n“Sam?”, I asked in confusion.\n\nFrom a small cave near where Aurora was standing, Sam walked out. Since the last time I’d seen him, he looked… different. His eyes seemed rather… dead. Like the spark in his eyes had gone out.\n\n“Sam!” Diana cried out as he walked over to our location. He, however, did not seem to hear her. Walking over to Raj’s rope, he pulled out a bolt cutter.\n\n“No, don’t do it!”, I begged.\n\n“Sam! Stop!”, Diana added.\n\nWithout heeding our pleas, he severed the rope using the bolt cutter. Raj fell down the roughly ten metre height and slammed into the Himalayan rock.\n\nEven years later, I have never been able to forget the image of Raj’s body lying at the bottom of the cliff, broken, bruised and covered in his own blood. Indisputably, for all purposes, dead. It is a memory that will stay with me till the day I die. I have seen many deaths from that period of time, but I never expected to lose someone so close to me, who I spoke to just a few hours before.\n\nAfter that, I don’t remember what happened. It was as though I was in a daze. \n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites/)",
