        "text": "”Dad! Dad! Look at the birdy!”\n\nEver since Jamie was old enough to understand that I’m an ornithologist, or ”bird guy”, she’s been asking for me to tell her about all the birds she spots. She can sit with her tablet for hours, listening to bird calls, quizzing me to see if I can tell what type of bird it is. She’s been asking me to get her a pair of cockatiels for about a year now. She’s a bit obsessive.\n\n”What is it, dad? What’s the birdy?”\n\nI was trying to read an article, but I knew better than to ask Jamie to wait. I leaned back in my chair, stretched, and looked out the window.\n\nAnd I had no idea what I was looking at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, I live in a rural area. This is Juniper, WV. So when I look outside and see a bright red tropical-looking bird, I know for a fact that something isn’t adding up.\n\n”What’s the birdy, dad? What is it?”\n\n”I dunno, honey,” I admitted. ”Let’s go have a look.”\n\nI brought my binoculars, trail mix, and hiking boots. Jamie followed suit. And yes, of course she has her own binoculars. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe stepped into the backyard to get a better look at the strange bird. It was about 8 inches tall, excluding the tail feathers. It had a slick black crest, with blue wingbars fading into a pearl white. It had the crooked beak shape of a vulture, but it had a feathered head and zygodactyl feet. I’d never seen anything like it.\n\nThe moment I put down my binoculars, it took off into the woods. Jamie was still struggling to get the covers on her binoculars off, and she was wildly unhappy not to get a better look at the birdy.\n\n“Where’d it go, dad? Where is it ?”\n\n“It probably went home to its’ family,” I said. “I think that’s someone’s pet.”\n\n“I hope they find it,” Jamie pouted.\n\n“I’m sure they will.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI double-checked local shelters and pet groups online to see if there were any escaped tropical birds, but I couldn’t find anything. There aren’t that many bird owners nearby. There are some up in Bridgeport, but it’d be a stretch for a parrot to get from there all the way down here. Still, I put up the equivalent of some digital ‘missing’ fliers and forgot about it. I still hadn’t read my work article.\n\nWhen I called Jamie for dinner, she came into the kitchen all excited and bouncy. She held onto her binoculars for dear life.\n\n“Dad, the birdy is still there,” she said. “Can I go look at it?”\n\n“After dinner, honey.”\n\n“What if it flies away?”\n\n“Then it probably went home.”\n\n“That’s what you said last time!”\n\nShe pouted her way through every bite of lasagna, and as soon as her fork hit the empty plate, she was out in the backyard to look at the birdy.\n\nI wasn’t worried. Jamie knew the rules.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I finished up the article and sent a few work texts, I leaned back in my chair and stretched; only to see Jamie running into the woods at full speed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swallowed my heart and ran.\n\nI didn’t even bother to put on shoes. I just burst into a sprint, calling out to her. The forest isn’t a dangerous place in and of itself, but there could be snakes. Also, Jamie was too young to properly find her way back before dark. She hadn’t gotten far, but I couldn’t take the risk.\n\nIt took me about five minutes to find her. She was standing in the middle of the woods with her binoculars, happily pointing down a path where the pretty red bird sat, looking at us.\n\n“It lives here, dad!” Jamie grinned.\n\nI just hugged her and held her tight. I wasn’t even mad; just relieved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took her back home and had a stern talk. She’d just been excited to see the bird, there was nothing more to it. Still, she had to learn that she couldn’t go running into the woods like that. I told her how unsafe it could be, and that if she wanted to go further than the backyard, she had to ask me first. I’m not unreasonable.\n\nThat night, as I collapsed in front of my computer, I had only one thing in mind; that bright red bird. It was clearly used to being around people, reinforcing the idea that it was a pet of some kind. Still, no one had called in a missing pet bird.\n\nAs a final effort I sent a message to my work buddy, Cymone. I asked her if she’d heard anything.\n\nI was about to log off when I got a message back, almost immediately.\n\n“You seen it too?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met up at work the next day. Cymone is a classic meat-and-potatoes kind of woman. She’d had her dad’s green ranger cap for so long I’d forgotten what color her short hair even was. I’d never seen that woman worried, but this time, there was something brewing under the surface of her frown.\n\n“My kids saw it,” she said. “I just caught a glimpse of it. Heading west, uphill.”\n\n“I saw from the, uh, northwest,” I said. “Heading east.”\n\n“Well, I suppose that narrows it down. It’s probably nesting up in the hardwoods. Birchwood is too sparse for something that sticks out that bad.”\n\n“You think it’s nesting?”\n\n“Sure,” nodded Cymone. “It’s a hefty bird.”\n\n“Well, if you hear anything else, let me know.”\n\n“You can check it yourself,” smiled Cymone. “We’re going up there this weekend.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Grosbeak migration. They just posted the schedules.”\n\n“I thought Sammy was going. Wasn’t it her and Babin?”\n\n“They’re doing warblers,” chuckled Cymone. “Get your birds straight.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat entire week, Jamie bugged me about bringing her along. I thought about it, but it was her mother’s weekend, and I didn’t want to be a bother. Besides, Jamie would get bored within the first 30 minutes and spend the rest of the day dragging her feet. This was a work outing. There was no way to tell if we were even gonna see that red thing again.\n\nStill, it always kills me to say ‘no’ to Jamie. She knows exactly what to say.\n\nBut still, I did.\n\nThank God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting on Saturday morning, Cymone and I met up by the eastern hike trail. The forest that runs through the northern corner of Juniper has this amazing ability to always be uphill, no matter the angle you start at. Even going down feels like uphill. It’s just strange.\n\nWe’d wandered those trails a hundred times, and this time was no different. Cymone took point. We chatted about what our kids were doing at school. That might sound like a simple topic, but it can devolve into a thousand micro-discussions. Teachers, homework, classmates, sports, favorite subjects, all of it. Having that in common with another person just puts you on an equal ground that is hard to match.\n\nAfter a few hours of going uphill, we stopped for a rest. We checked our equipment. The forecast had promised clear skies, but we were starting to see some dark clouds on the horizon. With a bit of luck, we’d be on-site by late afternoon. Grosbeaks are migratory birds, so we keep tabs on the population regularly. It’s like checking bridges to make sure there are no cracks. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, you’re fine, but if something goes wrong you wanna know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was waiting for Cymone to double-check her map when she gently elbowed me.\n\n“You seeing this?”\n\nIt was that bird again.\n\nIt was sitting on a low branch just fifty feet down the trail. It made this strange warbling call, like a big quail. It looked straight at us, its’ black crest standing at attention. It didn’t seem skittish at all; it was definitely used to being near people.\n\n“Honestly, you have any idea what that is?” I asked.\n\n“Not a god damn clue.”\n\nWe finished our snack and got back up. As soon as we did, the bird took off to the northwest. Cymone and I were originally taking the trail to the northeast, but we figured a small detour wouldn’t hurt too bad. We were curious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spotted the bird three more times, going further and further into the forest. We found ourselves going off-trail. The bird just kept looking at us, moving whenever we got too close. I couldn’t put my finger on why, but it felt like this behavior was intentional; to stay close, but not close enough to catch it. But why didn’t it just fly off? Why did it stay close?\n\nAround lunchtime we started looking for somewhere to stop and do some (actual) work. We found a small clearing with a large boulder we could sit next to. I checked our equipment while Cymone put out some sandwiches. We were a bit off track, but we could loop back around and still check some of the nests.\n\nI almost choked on a ham sandwich when the red bird suddenly plopped down right in front of us, wings outstretched and crest flared. I was so surprised I fell off my log, dropping my bag. Cymone just bolted up and stepped back, clutching her chest.\n\nThe bird stepped on one of our sandwiches, keeping its’ wings out. It was being hostile, showing us that this wasn’t our territory.\n\nIt didn’t even eat the sandwich. It just pushed it aside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCymone and I got up, took our equipment, and backed away. The bird kept doing this horrible noise, like a rattlesnake mixed with a rooster. It had this strange resonance that made my stomach turn, like a sound that ‘tasted’ bad; and it was awful. Almost made me sick.\n\nCymone grabbed my arm and pulled me away. We took our equipment, abandoned our lunch, and figured it wasn’t worth the trouble.\n\nWe headed east, downhill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, out of the underbrush, there was a second bird. It was much larger, roughly the size of a goose, and it came straight at us. Cymone recoiled and tripped. She rolled down the hill screaming. I hurried after her, as the birds climbed up a nearby tree; watching us from afar.\n\nCymone hurt her foot, bad. It got stuck in a root and twisted almost 360 degrees. There was a lot of blood, and I could see something sharp poking out; possibly bone, or cartilage.\n\nI hurried to bring out the first aid-kit. Cymone was panicking. Her eyes had gone wide, and her hands were trembling.\n\n“It’s okay,” she kept repeating. “It’s okay.”\n\nI just bit my tongue and brought out the gauze. I elevated her leg, carefully, and started putting pressure on the wound. All the while, I could hear the birds warbling just up the path.\n\nIt started to sound like a laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCymone sat up and held her leg while I brought out my phone. I dialed the emergency services. With every ring, I saw the two birds creeping closer.\n\nBut there were more of them, coming out of the underbrush. At least six of them.\n\nThey weren’t really a threat, but there was a lot of them. They had beaks like scavengers, so they could probably smell blood. Maybe they thought Cymone was out for the count.\n\nThe moment my call connected the birds started screeching. It was that same awful noise, and it resonated in me something terrible. I dropped my phone to cover my ears. It was only for a moment, but that moment was enough for one of the bigger birds to grab the phone and disappear into the woods. The others followed suit, warbling with laughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCymone and I just sat there, looking at one another. I was trying my best to keep my lunch down, but that screech really rattled me. My hands were shaking as it dawned on me that we were stuck here. I would have to either go back on my own or carry Cymone back down. Neither was an option.\n\nLuckily, Cymone is a fighter. We made a makeshift crutch from a sturdy branch and wrapped it in fabric. I had to help her up steep hills, but the rest of the way she could move on her own. \n\nThe problem was that we were a bit off track. I wasn’t very familiar with that part of the woods, and Cymone had dropped her pack when she slipped. I had a map, but she’d been the one taking marks. Still, as long as we headed east we’d end up at the main road eventually, and I had a compass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were being followed. I counted at least eight different birds, ranging all the way from 6 to 30 inches in length. They kept their distance, but as soon as we stopped they crept closer. That goddamn warbling felt as ever-present as snapping twigs and wind rushing between the leaves.\n\nWe’d been walking for a few hours when Cymone stopped me. She could barely keep it together. She was so frustrated.\n\n“Stop,” she said. “Just… just stop. Look.”\n\nShe held out the compass. We’d been walking east, but north wasn’t steady. It was moving even though we stood still. North was pointing directly away from the family of red birds.\n\nI’d never seen anything like it, and I felt this sinking realization in my stomach. Without a reliable compass, we could be anywhere. We could’ve been walking in circles for hours. We could be two hours further into the woods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun had started to set. Following the path of the sun, we realized we’d been heading north rather than east. We could make some headway back east just by following the trail of the sun, but we’d be nowhere near the main road before nightfall. It was better to start making a shelter and prepare for the night.\n\nI found a clearing near a large tree and started setting up camp. I dug a makeshift wind shelter, using moss and branches for cover. I had to redress Cymone’s wound and try to keep it clean from infection. I found a log and set it up so she could keep her leg elevated. She was in a lot of pain, but she wasn’t in any immediate danger.\n\nWhile we ate, I checked the compass again. It was moving on its’ own; possibly a reaction to the strange birds. I started seeing a pattern; a circling. Much like vultures waiting for a meal.\n\nAnd still, that sound. At this point I was convinced. It wasn’t a warble; it was a laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen sun started to set, and the dark clouds had gathered overhead. A cold wind was blowing through the trees, and the moon was completely hidden. I could barely see my own hands. We had a pair of flashlights; our saving grace.\n\n“We… we should take turns sleeping,” said Cymone. “Just in case.”\n\n“Sure,” I said. “We should try to mask the blood, there could be bears.”\n\n“And how… how do you propose we do that?”\n\nI had a few ideas. Nothing pleasant, but it was a necessity. Sure, these birds were freaking me out, but there are many other dangers out in the wilds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn eternity passed. Everything looks the same in the dark, and all I could hear was the warbling and the wind. The birds were still circling us, and they weren’t letting up. I almost stopped hearing them for a while; it just became this background noise.\n\nCymone and I took turns resting. After shifting back and forth a few times, we started getting sloppy. It was close to midnight by then, and it felt like we’d been there for weeks. Time passes so slowly when you are in discomfort, waiting for the cold and the dark to go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, we both fell asleep.\n\nI remember waking up, disoriented. Something brushed against the back of my head and retreated into the dark. I reached for my flashlight, but it wasn’t there.\n\nI wasn’t where I was supposed to be either. I’d been moved about four feet from where I’d fallen asleep, and I had some kind of warm slobber on the back of my neck.\n\nThe warbling had stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRealization dawned on me; something had tried to drag me away from the shelter.\n\nI scrambled to my feet.\n\n“Cymone!” I called out. “What… what the fuck was that?!”\n\nThere was no response.\n\nI held my breath, listening. Nothing but the wind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI crawled my way back to the shelter, only to realize Cymone was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt around for her flashlight. Mine was gone, but maybe hers wasn’t. It took me a while, but I finally found her house keys. They had a little finger-sized flashlight attached. It wasn’t much, but it was all I had.\n\n“Cymone?!” I called out, wiping the warm goop from my neck. “Cymone!”\n\nNothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was gone. There were a few spatters of blood from her wound, but that was it. Her green ranger cap remained; she’d never leave that.\n\nI started looking around the clearing. It took me a while to find a large patch of moss and grass, where I could see the ground had been pressed down.\n\nNo, not just pressed down. Something had been dragged through here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just stood there, trying to make sense of it. Cymone was gone. And now, I could hear something other than wind.\n\nEating.\n\nTiny, ripping bites. \n\nBeaks too full to laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething was moving.\n\nSomething big.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned around, peering into the dark with my flashlight. Something was coming my way. There was a deep groan, and a galloping run.\n\nEverything in me told me to flee, but I was just… frozen. I stood there, and waited for whatever would come. Maybe it was a part of me that knew that there was no way for me to run from something that fast; I had to face it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe flashlight flickered, but held.\n\nI caught a glimpse of it.\n\nIt ran on all fours. It had feathers, perfectly blending into the underbrush. Two large black orbs for eyes, and a sharp beak that could easily fit my neck.\n\nIt stopped ahead of my flashlight, staying just out of sight. It growled, making the ground tremble.\n\nMy flashlight flickered again, and it came sprinting forward.\n\nAs the flicker stopped, it retreated. It made an awful screeching noise, so loud that my eardrums moved. It made me lose my balance, but I caught myself against a tree.\n\nIt was circling me. The small ones had started darting back and forth, nipping at my legs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spun around, trying to use my light to keep them at bay. That’s when I stepped on my lost phone. It was broken beyond use, but it was right there. They’d dragged it along. Or maybe we just hadn’t gone that far to begin with.\n\nI had to do something. Try something. A nip at my foot opened a little wound, and the smell of blood made them all the more eager. The warbling started. The laughing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put the flashlight in my mouth and picked up the cellphone. I broke it open and removed the battery. Using a metal wire from my keychain, I short-circuited the battery by pressing the wire into the positive and negative terminals. It warmed up the wire just enough for me to set fire to a tuft of bush.\n\nIt was just a little ember, and the battery was already dead. But I cradled that ember between my hands, still biting down on the flashlight. Movement all around me; unseen, waiting for me to let my guard down. For the light to die.\n\nSuddenly, a tug at my leg. In less than a second, I was three feet away from my budding fire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey were biting me. Something large was grunting with effort. I kicked as hard as I could, hitting something resembling rock, or a beak.\n\nIt didn’t even flinch.\n\nI pulled at my leg with all my might, opening an inch-deep gash in my ankle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI crawled back as my fire flared up to the size of a fist. It was barely holding on from the wind, but it was growing. I’d been lucky.\n\nUsing branches and a ripped piece of fabric from my pants, I managed to make something resembling a torch. I could see something big staying out of reach; just out of sight. It wasn’t done with me yet, and neither were the little ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gathered everything I could find and made a small campfire. I positioned myself with my back against a tree, so nothing could sneak up from behind. All I had to do was to keep the fire alive, and I’d make it out of there. Dawn would come.\n\nBut I could see it. Out there, in the dark. Those dark globes staring at me, unblinking, unrelenting.\n\nI couldn’t run. I couldn’t let it psych me out. Thinking back to Jamie, I told myself there was only one thing to do if I wanted to see her again.\n\nI just had to look at the birdy.\n\nJust look at it, dad.\n\nThat’s all there is to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt circled me. It growled. It made aggressive outbursts, trying to rattle me. But that was all that came of it. I held fast, stayed close to the fire, and stared it down.\n\nLook at the birdy. Look at the birdy. Look at the god damn birdy until the dark goes away.\n\nAnd it did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce morning came, they retreated into the forest, full of meat and marrow. \n\nThey’d gotten their prize.\n\nI’m not going to go into detail what they did to Cymone. I can’t bring myself to put it into words.\n\nThere was nothing of Cymone left. Just a body.\n\nIt was the most gruesome night of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I made it home.\n\nThe police are treating it like an animal attack. There was no talk of strange red birds or… whatever stalked us. They classified it as a black bear.\n\nI’m not convinced.\n\nI’m looking for a new place to live. Jamie has been staying with her mother while I recover. I’ve tried finding out anything about these things, but no one seems to know anything. Babin practically laughed me out of the office when I suggested a bird like that could even exist in West Virginia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I can’t bring back Jamie here. Not yet. At night, I imagine hearing the warble outside my bedroom window. Sometimes, I see flashes of red in the woods. I’m sure they’re still out there, trying to lure people deeper into the forest.\n\nAnd to think, they looked so innocent.\n\nWe just wanted to look at the birdy.",

        "text": "Being an avid user of the internet, be it Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. I do get the occasional bot or scammer in my dms. When it came to accounts like this, I would usually send them a message or two before I found out that they either weren’t real or were out to scam me. The thing about online scammers is that they have a weird but simple way of doing things that makes it really easy to identify them among other, real accounts. \n\nTheir username usually has some real name in it mixed with another word and then a couple random numbers after it, like “LilyLight2328,” or “MaxChair4380,” or something similar. They also usually have a picture of a random sexy woman as their profile picture. The app that I usually get these messages on is an app where it's pretty much a rule that you never put your real name or a real picture of yourself on it.\n\nThis is why, after what felt like hundreds of messages from these scam accounts, I found a way to have a little fun with them. I would follow along with their little act, despite their obvious lack of knowledge when it came to the English language. They would ask me to buy the usual stuff like gift cards and tell me to give them the code, and I would pretend that I did just to keep their hopes up. Essentially, I would waste their time until I got bored and blocked them.\n\nBut recently I found a very easy and fun way to piss them off. Insulting them in their native language was just the thing I was looking for. “Oloribu omo ofo” was the phrase. In English it translates to “Empty-headed child” but to them it basically means “I hope your child is stillborn.” Which upon sending to them will usually force them out of their friendly English mode and into their hostile Indian or whatever mode. \n\nIt didn’t always work though. With as many people that exist in the world today it’s likely that your everyday scammer isn’t the race you think he is. He could be Russian, Chinese, Nigerian, or even American. But the business that is online scamming never strays too far from their usual personnel. \n\nUsually when I send the text, “Oloribu omo ofo,” the person on the other end responds in the same language. They usually send up to ten angry messages before they stop and block me. Despite not being able to understand their language I can still see the waves of anger being emitted with every text they send. I’ve done this at least twenty times in the past week and it never stops being funny. \n\nThat was until a few days ago. I was just getting off of working at Dunkin’ Donuts when I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket. I pulled it out to see I had gotten a message on one of my apps from a person whose username I didn’t recognize. “HazelGrass985” was the username. I knew instantly that this wasn’t a real person. Their only message was “Hi.” I didn’t even bother playing along with them, so I just sent “Oloribu omo ofo” and stuck my phone back in my pocket. \n\nOn the short walk to my car, I began to smile to myself due to the feeling of eight vibrations in my pocket in close succession. I got into my car and took my phone back out to plug it into the aux cord when I noticed the messages that the scammer had been sending. Most of them were in his native tongue but his final one was in English.\n\nI froze in my seat, staring at the message on my phone until the screen went dark and the phone turned off from lack of use. I turned to my left and looked at my place of work before quickly turning back to my phone. And for the first time since I began doing this, I translated what the scammers messages said. \n\nHis messages read like this:\n\n“Why?”\n\n “You will never get love from your mother or god.”\n\n“Do you wish to go?”\n\n “I can see it now .” \n\n“You are smaller than me.”\n\n“I have a weapon.”\n\n“I will see you soon.”\n\n“Dunkin’ Donuts.”",

        "text": "It was like any other day. \n\nThe sun sat directly overhead, warming the waves as they rolled by. \n\nThe sails of my vessel creaked rhythmically, and the hull bent as if it would fail at any moment. I wiped the sweat off my brow and focused on the small dot on the horizon.\n\nI would reach that small dot in around four hour’s time, just before sunset.\n\nI straightened the wheel and let the wind take the reins as I sat on the floor and drank my final bottle of water. Being recycled rainwater, it had a small and rather strange aftertaste, but was extraordinarily crisp nonetheless. I set the then empty bottle down and shifted my attention to the wall opposite to me. The yellowing calendar pinned on the wall was covered in little red lines, reminding me of the length of this journey, and precisely why I had to continue.\n\nIt was day three-hundred and eighty four. \n\nA year since we were exiled to the seas. \n\nA year since the angels came.\n\nA full year prior I was just like anyone else. I went to school like everyone else, and I had dreams and aspirations like everyone else. I had a family like everyone else. I certainly wasn’t a prodigy by any means, but I was normal, and lived a normal life; and looking back it’s something I far too often took for granted.\n\nThen, as if a switch flipped, the day of reckoning came. \n\nNew York City was the first to be hit. Distant spectators of the first arrival recalled a blinding light in the center of the city, followed by a faint chorus of beautiful singing far onto the horizon.\n\nThe reality however, was far more sinister than the surface-level observations could ever predict. Those present at the first arrival shortly broke out into deranged fits of screaming for up to a full day at a time, abject horror plastered across their face. Then as if a switch flipped once more, they would simply go silent, and begin walking. Regardless of where they were, they all began walking in the same direction, through streets and mountains, hills and valleys; all towards an imaginary point on the horizon only they could see.\n\nOf course, many collapsed and perished before completing their journey. However, every victim of this event had one common denominator, being they all perished face-down, with a single outstretched arm pointing in the same direction.\n\nAcross the planet, they all seemed to be pointing towards an unknown point on the oceanic horizon. Before the grid was officially knocked out from the following few hundred arrivals, many, such as myself, took note of this and departed to the seas in order to hopefully find this point. \n\nPerhaps that point was the origin of the cataclysmic events. The surviving few of us could maybe put an end to everything, by some unreasonable odds and methods of which we didn’t know at the time. Perhaps we might meet the same unfortunate fate once we arrived. All we knew is that it was the only certainty we had left, and we were most certainly not going to let it slip away.\n\nWe were thankfully right in our assertions, as around fifty miles apart each, there were about a dozen islands at that imaginary point in the distance, fashioned in a strange geological grid. One of them presumably had some semblance of the answers we were looking for, but I had found no such thing in my previous three visits to the outlying islands. There were mostly friendly island locals you could trade with that would often offer shelter from the night, but they rarely spoke a single word, and didn’t appear to understand much spoken to them either.\n\nNevertheless, I persisted.\n\nI shook myself back to reality, and noticed that the dot on the horizon was now significantly closer. \n\nSimilarly, another sailboat was approaching on the horizon as well, seeming to go perpendicular to my path.\n\nI used a mirror to attempt to signal them to little avail, and they were eventually almost on my starboard side. I quickly ignited the auxiliary motor, it slowly sputtering to life as it sluggishly propelled me out of the incoming ship’s path. As it passed behind me I peered over the deck to potentially catch a glimpse of another survivor, only to see the deck of the boat in shambles. Supplies thrown around, with the interior in an even further state of disarray.\n\nThere was no captain to be seen, presumably lost at sea by an arrival.\n\nThe arrivals were far more uncommon at sea, being practically non-existent during the day. However at night, sailing in open water was far more of a risky gamble, so being on land and sheltered was a far safer bet.\n\nWhen I departed the shoreline eleven months prior, I could spot around eleven ships on the horizon sailing in the same direction. We never directly interacted closely, as large groups of people seemed to attract the angels, but would occasionally signal each other from a distance regarding heading and weather conditions and such. On many occasions, singing or laughing could be heard coming from distant vessels, showing some semblance of normal life.\n\nBy this point, I was the only surviving member of that makeshift fleet.\n\nNobody else made it to the first island.\n\nNevertheless, I paid my respects to the ship as it passed by, and continued on.\n\nThe original dot on the horizon had begun to grow into a largely visible land mass, and the sun was just beginning to set. As any other day, I stood up and took charge of the wheel, and as any other day, I continued on.",

        "text": "Greg was an adventurer despite everything he’d been through. He took to the hill behind his home with firm footsteps, marching up the mile long road like it was a path to great treasure. Even as his sister and I plodded behind him, sweat pouring down us in the stifling August heat, he turned and cried for us to keep up. How he was so animated, I didn’t know. Not even grasshoppers chirruped under the midday sun, and the tall grass, usually so green, had turned to yellow straw as summer reached its peak.\n\n“Come on!” he cried as he reached a seemingly arbitrary spot on the road. “I saw it this way!” He pointed into the grass, a thin footpath barely visible between wavering fronds.\n\n“What did you see?” Samantha shouted. She was usually so calm and responsible, but I could tell she was close to blowing that cool head of hers.\n\nNot long ago, Greg and Samantha had been a trio. The loss of their older brother, gone two years by this point, had broken their parents in an unusual way. It was not uncommon to lose children in my hometown. It felt like every year the class register grew shorter by at least two names. But where most parents became overprotective, Greg’s had gone the other way. They grew listless and morose, withdrawing not only from the world, but their remaining children. Three times a week, Greg and Samantha came to my house and ate food with us. The rest of the time Samantha cooked for her family, just as she packed Greg’s lunches and washed his clothes and did anything else that a parent usually did. If she’d been older, she would have probably forbidden Greg’s “expeditions'' entirely. But she was young and exhausted, and every time Greg set out to explore the wilderness at the edge of town his face lit up so bright it must have been impossible to say no.\n\nToday he had dragged us both to see something he’d found. Something that he claimed was incredible.\n\n“You have to see for yourself!” he said when we caught up with him. Samantha and I were breathless, but Greg was practically jumping on the spot with excitement.\n\n“I need a break,” I whined.\n\n“A good idea Stephen,” Samantha replied in between heavy breaths. “Let’s just… let’s just enjoy the view.”\n\nWe turned to face our home.\n\nOn our left was the forest, on our right open space, and below us, built on the sloping side of the mountain was our hometown. Looking at it from so far, it appeared plain and small and normal. But in the corner of our eyes, drifting from the spaces between the trees of the forest, we could see the red twine. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of strands floated over open air down the slope we’d just climbed and entered the town miles below where it formed a complex and ever-changing web. Each string had small golden bells attached at every metre, and you’d think that with the string strung so far between such distant points that every gust of wind would create a chorus of ringing. But they were silent, and they would remain so unless someone was careless enough to touch one of the snares.\n\n“It’s actually kind of beautiful,” Samantha mused quietly, and I found myself agreeing. “You’ve checked for snares on this route?” she asked her brother.\n\n“I checked yesterday!” he cried, turning to the path like a dog straining on a leash. “It’s not far! It’s right there!”\n\n“The twine could’ve moved since then,” she said. “I don’t like this. I don’t think we should be doing this. It’s dangerous. Think about the Golden ru—”\n\n“I know the Golden rule!” Greg suddenly screamed. “Don’t touch the thread! Don’t touch the thread!\"\n\nGreg kept shouting the phrase over and over until his face turned pink.\n\n“Did it help Johnathan!?” he finally shrieked as he lost energy. “No! He was the most careful of all and it still got him so what’s the *fucking* point!”\n\nSamantha’s gasp was so loud it stopped Greg’s tantrum dead in its tracks. For a second her hand twitched and I thought she was going to hit her younger brother, but it was only the slightest of movements.\n\n“Right!” she said, as stern as any headmistress. “That’s it. Back we go. Stephen I’m sorry Greg had to ruin this by being a potty mouth.”\n\nGreg’s soured into regret and despair.\n\n“No no no! You have to believe me. You have to see it!”\n\nSamantha took a deep breath and knelt down to Greg’s level.\n\n“Do you know what the most important rule really is?”\n\n“Don’t touch the thread,” Greg sobbed.\n\n“No.” Samantha shook her head. “The most important rule, the one that you’ll one day appreciate is the hardest of them all, is the one that says you never, *ever,* help someone who’s touched a snare.”\n\n“I know that.” His words were choked out between heaving breaths.\n\n“No you don’t. I mean, you do. But you don’t really know what it means. What it actually means is leaving someone you love behind. Even if they scream. Even if they cry. Even when… even when *it* comes to take them. You walk away, run if you can. And you don’t look back. Could you do that to me, Greg? If I was lying there crying for you to help me, could you just run away?”\n\n“I… I… I don’t know.”\n\n“If I had to do that, I think it would kill me. My heart would never be whole again. Do you want to leave me for dead if something goes wrong?” Greg shook his head to signal *no*. “That’s why we should turn back,” Samantha continued. “This is too risky. You’re too excited. Do you know what it would do to me if you ran over one? Do you…”\n\nSamantha swallowed and wiped her teary eyes with her cardigan sleeve.\n\n“We’re going home. That’s final.”\n\nShe turned towards me and went to speak, but in the few seconds where her back was to Greg, his face scrunched up and all his anger returned. I thought he was going to leap at her and start kicking and punching, but he did something much worse.\n\nHe ran into the tall grass.\n\nSamantha didn’t even have time to turn around and call his name before we saw the grass disturbed, and heard a loud *thump* followed by a twang and the ringing of a bell. The snare, wherever it was, must have been perfectly placed to catch him. There were a few agonising seconds before Greg started crying. I could tell from his voice that my friend had seriously hurt himself, but neither Samantha nor I moved.\n\nThe bell kept ringing. It would not stop. It was an unnatural sound and one by one the red twine in the distance began to shiver sympathetically and a thousand other bells joined in. The haunting sound lit up not only the mountainside, but the town below us, and I knew that already my family would be terrified to find me and know that I was safe.\n\nI wanted to run back to them, to flee the rising alarm that seized not only my thoughts but the very air around me as miles and miles of web thrummed with anticipation. But before I could turn, Greg appeared out of the grass and stared at us.\n\nHe was, in spite of everything, silent. It must have been shock. He certainly looked like he was surprised to find several metres of ordinary looking twine fused to the bare skin on his arms and face in coiling bunches. No blood. Just swollen flesh slowly turning pink as if it too was shocked to find its own boundaries violated and was now having a delayed reaction. Quick. Invader. Shut it down. But this was no microbe or allergen. Several strands of the stuff had fused to his hair and face and arms, and in places like his cheeks and ears it had even punched through the flesh entirely and emerged on the other side. With a firm grip it was slowly but surely beginning to pull him back into the woods. That force would only increase with every passing second until there was simply no resisting.\n\nBut Greg fought on. He pushed against them and staggered towards us, reaching out a hand threaded with twine. Samantha didn’t move, but she did raise a hand as if ready to embrace him. But the sound of me crying out and falling backwards made her look away from her brother, who finally began to wail and sob. She fixed me with teary eyes and in that moment I watched Samantha’s heart break before she turned from her weeping brother, grabbed my hand, and ran.\n\nGreg followed.\n\nNeither of us knew it detail what happened when the snares caught you, but as Greg continued to stumble after us, his cries and pleas growing increasingly furious, I darkly found myself wishing it’d just hurry up and be over with. Looking back I’m surprised at the ten year old’s imaginative vocabulary, but he was facing death and I think his mind dug deep. God he hated us in those moments. I’m sure of that. He was scared and hurting and the only people close to him were abandoning him. He told us we’d go to hell. He told us we deserved to die. He told us a lot, not stopping until half-way down the hill when he finally fell. I turned, not meaning or wanting to, and saw him push himself up with his hands, gravel embedded in the puffy bleeding skin of his face, and he glared at me with burning hatred. He tried to pull at the snares embedded in his forearms, but his hands bonded to the twine immediately and it only left him too tangled up to resist any further.\n\nThe twine pulled harder and he fell backwards, and with kicking feet he was dragged slowly out of sight.\n\nI was so afraid of what I’d seen, I soiled myself and my vision blurred. My legs grew faint and  Samantha, barely slowing, picked me up and carried me the rest of the way. When we reached the town my parents were waiting for us. They held me so tight that it hurt my little ribs but I didn’t care. I sobbed into my mother’s arms and paid only a moment’s notice to the weak, hysterical Samantha whose own parents were nowhere to be seen.\n\n\\-\n\n“I can’t believe you bought it.”\n\n“I can’t believe they sold it,” I replied as the helicopter banked over the town below. From this high up the snares resembled something blood red and fleshy, the floating cilia of a strange jellyfish tangled in an artificial reef. The town, a litter of miniatures that grew from the mountainside like a coral, was clearly abandoned. It had never been well looked after, not even when we lived there, but over the last few years it had begun to look apocalyptic.\n\n“Did the government tell you any more about what they found?” Samantha asked.\n\nI looked across at the woman beside me. She looked older than her age, but there still remained a ghost of the teenage girl who’d saved my life, and if I looked further still, a hint of resemblance to her brother. *Does it hurt for her to look in the mirror?* I wondered. *Does that familial resemblance sting?* So many ghosts lingered around her, not just Greg’s.\n\nTwo brothers, two parents. No one was around to witness the latter’s abduction, but their disappearance was no mystery. How could it be? People did not go ‘missing’ in my hometown. Everyone *knew* what it meant if someone failed to show up at breakfast, or was a no-show at work or church. It meant they’d gotten careless. It meant they’d touched a snare and there was no coming back from that mistake. Although in the case of Samantha’s parents it was unclear if they’d done so by accident.\n\n“They didn’t find anything,” I said. “Nothing concrete anyway. I think it frustrated them, this unsolvable problem. Maybe they hope I’ll throw enough money at it to figure it out. Let some billionaire spend his cash and leave their budgets alone. God knows it’s what most people think when they find out I have money.”\n\nAn awkward silence settled between us.\n\n“Thank you,” Samantha said once it had gone on long enough. “I know you must get a lot of people asking for charity…”\n\n“Don’t worry,” I replied, cutting her off. “I didn’t mean… It’s the least I could do. He was my friend too.”\n\n“It’s just if that drone footage is real…”\n\nShe was referring to the one bit of fruitful evidence the government had dug up, a short video taken by an aerial drone racing through overgrown trees. It lasted no more than five seconds, covering a hundred or so metres before the machine had failed. But for the first time in mine or Samantha’s life, we had finally had a glimpse into the forbidden woods which were the source of the red snares. Five seconds of nothing. Five seconds of blurry trees and autumnal leaves.\n\nAnd a frame.\n\nA single frame.\n\nA frame that was emailed to Samantha by an anonymous researcher. A frame that prompted her to call me and cash in all that guilt. I could’ve been angry to find this ghost of my childhood returned, demanding I spend millions on some whim, but I wasn’t. She had sent me the image and I immediately knew what she wanted and why. Six months later and I’d managed to bribe enough officials to let me purchase the derelict and empty remains of my hometown.\n\nThe image was of Greg. A blurred shadow recognisable only by the distinct make and colouring of his clothes. Details burned into both mine and Samantha’s memories. Details neither of us could forget. No you could not see his face, but we didn’t have to.\n\nWe knew it was him anyway.\n\nSamantha’s expression grew sad as her eyes fell to the window where the town passed directly beneath us. We were slowing as the chopper approached the landing site. I’d briefed the pilot that the situation was fluid, and he would need to keep a keen eye out for a place free of snares. A glance at the direction he was taking told me he was heading straight for the church.\n\n“Do you know what it was like? In the end?” she asked, eyes still on the town. Even from this height, we could see thousands of snares snaking from building to building, window to window, through abandoned cars and around tilting telephone poles. A cat’s cradle of shimmering red twine.\n\n“Dad called a few weeks before he disappeared,” I answered. “Every couple months he’d call and go through *the list*. Every time it got smaller. In the end it was just one person. I asked if it had been a good month, if people had been extra careful. He told me there just weren’t enough people to go missing anymore. In the end, he was the last. Stubborn bastard refused to move.”\n\nDown below, the church raced into view. In the months since the town had emptied, the once impeccably kept grass had been left to grow wild and unkempt in the Autumn heat. I wondered what it might hide, so I leaned forward and got the pilot’s attention. “Radio the guys on the ground and tell them not to step on the grass,” I shouted. “They used to keep it short for a reason.”\n\nThe pilot gave a thumbs up before speaking into his mic. Standing sheepishly at the edge of the old lawn, three small figures looked up at us and waved to get our attention.\n\nWhen I’d first paid for the expedition to enter the town and map its contents, there had been four. Two scientists and two former soldiers hired as security. It didn’t surprise me looking down that we were missing one of the scientists.\n\n\\-\n\n“It’s worse than ever before.”\n\nDr Wagner, the expedition’s scientist, looked at me with curiosity as we picked our way carefully down Main street.\n\n“It wasn’t unusual for one of the roads to have a few snares across it,” I added. “But the air is practically red with the stuff.”\n\n“Perhaps it has become frustrated with the lack of food,” she replied.\n\n“You think it eats them?” I asked and she nodded. “Seems possible,” I added as I studied a nearby shop window. A little boutique that sold dresses, the kind women would wear to church. I remember waiting outside while my mother perused inside for what felt like hours on end. Sometimes I would grow impatient and want to go inside too, but something about the mannequin in the window scared me. Faceless. Featureless. Hard plastic limbs. What was it about the lack of eyes that left me convinced it was looking right at me? It had only gotten worse with age, its head a rorschach of peeling paint, beige on white on tarnished gun metal greys.\n\n“It must be intelligent, sentient if not sapient,” Wagner said as I turned away from the unsettling doll. The scientist was a small woman in her late forties, usually quite brazen and funny, but twenty four hours in this town had already worn her down. “It knew to target the objects that Mike… Dr Mignola touched regularly.”\n\nI cringed at the reminder of the expedition’s losses.\n\n“It isn’t just intelligent,” I said. “It’s vindictive. Did I tell you what happens if you damage the thread?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“One man set fire to a whole bunch of snares on his lawn,” I told her. “Used a can of spray paint and his lighter. Woke up the next day to find a snare punched right through his belly and tied to a bed spring on the other side.”\n\nThe scientist winced at the thought, but I left out the part where the man had stayed in his bed for a full two days before he was finally driven mad by the itch of the twine running through his guts. I’d heard from some older kids that in the end he tore at himself like an animal in a trap, and in a rare twist the twine did not take him. It left his body there, skewered on a piece of string, and the doctor had to come round with a couple farmers and cut him out. But still the twine stayed fixed and taut so that his family could not get rid of anything it touched. Not she sheets. Not the mattress. Not even the half inch or so of flesh the twine had bonded to. The stink of infection infested the house, they said, and on hot summer days it even reached the street outside.\n\n“It must have been hell living here,” she said. “Why would anyone stay?”\n\n“Most people didn’t. Just about everyone my age left as soon as they got old enough. Town went from five thousand to a few hundred in just a couple decades,” I replied. “When my dad was a kid there were maybe two or three snares at a time. Few enough if you got tangled others could cut you out without too much risk to themselves. Hurt like fucking hell, mind, but survivable. By the time it got real bad, some people were just too old or stubborn. Plus I suspected some stayed in the hope those taken would come back. My father was definitely in that camp.”\n\n“At least *you* got out,” Wagner said. “If you’d stayed you would’ve either been taken already, or probably gone insane from the loneliness.”\n\nI understood her words but I didn’t feel them. People who were born into this were never really normal. I couldn’t take a piss without checking the door five times each way. Sleep was short, fitful at best since that was always when you were most vulnerable. From what I understood, most people who’d left the town hadn’t fared so well.\n\n“I suppose.” I shrugged and we continued to carefully step over strands of red twine that thrummed with excitement as our feet passed over. We got maybe half-way down Main street before Wagner tripped, fell, and set off the first of the snares.\n\n\\-\n\n“Drop it.”\n\nShe lowered her backpack without taking her eyes off it. Lucky woman had fallen in such a way her bag had taken the hit, but already other snares had started to gum up the fabric. They attracted each other, somehow. You never saw them move. They just appeared when you weren’t looking, almost like they were always there. But a quick person could beat them.\n\n“Jesus Christ!” I cried. “Step away!”\n\nWagner ran over to me as dozens more snares appeared wrapped around her backpack. Slowly they began to constrict, melding into and right through the material, looking for the flesh of its owner, while still dragging it further into the web so more snares could seize it. Slowly but surely, the bag was dragged into the darkness of a nearby alley.\n\n“Fuck that was close,” the scientist said once the bag was out of sight.\n\nI didn’t bother chastising her. No one could really get *used* to this kind of place. You had to live with it for years before the lessons it taught you sank in. I merely offered to take a short break, sharing what little food I had, before the pair of us continued. At least she was a little more watchful going forward. Nothing more I could ask for.\n\nThe journey dragged on for hours with our pace so slow. We used the time to document what we saw. The state of the town. Crumbling buildings. Twine punctured glass without shattering it, blending perfectly with wood, rock, metal, and plastic where one end met man-made structures while the other ran off towards the horizon, inevitably disappearing into the darkness beneath the forest’s canopy. From there, no one knew where it led. Only that disappearing into the woods meant you never came back. Meanwhile the silence bore down on us. I wasn’t used to it. Certainly not here of all places, what was once a home to me. But aside from us moving and speaking, there was nothing to break up the ear silence and even then, our words felt intrusive and dangerous. Like we might catch the attention of something lurking just out of sight, perhaps somewhere behind the windows that peered down on us. Old grey and grimy, the rooms beyond hidden like islands in the fog. The only splash of colour, the red twine that ensnared the spaces within those decrepit rooms. Hardware shops. Florists. Record stores. Apartments once occupied by people who had left no one behind to claim their things, so now toasters and TVs and ovens and fridges and all manner of personal items lingered on, gathering no dust because there was no one left to shed skin and create some.\n\nI felt watched by those windows. Slowly but surely my paranoia spiked, like a child in a haunted house convinced that something was waiting to jump out. Wagner spoke to me in places and I just ignored her, willing her into silence out of fear of something coming along. At one point she had to grab me to get my attention.\n\n“Do you hear that?” she asked, her eyes wide with fear and I realised for the first time it wasn’t just me who’d been feeling the pressure.\n\nI listened.\n\nThere it was. A tinkle of a bell, but unlike the ones I’d heard when a snare was touched. This was gentle. Playful. Singular. A lone bell, a lone piece of twine somewhere, being played with like a cat batting a toy.\n\n“What the fuck?” I muttered, clearly more baffled by this than Wagner. The bells did not ring alone. I knew this. Everyone in the town knew this. They always screamed in unison.\n\nAs quickly as it came it stopped, but we investigated anyway, pulled by the lure into the doorway of a shop. I went first, Wagner close behind. When she saw the figure standing there she gasped but whatever noise I wanted to make was caught in my throat. At first I assumed it was another person, but their stock-still pose could not have been achieved by anyone with a pulse.\n\nIt was a mannequin. *The* mannequin. The one I’d studded at the other end of the street. It even wore the same clothes. It had been punctured by snares in dozens of places. The head. The neck. The elbows and knees. So much so it resembled a marionette, and even as the comparison popped into my head it turned to face us. Stiff rotation achieved by the tug of the twine. With more stilted movement it reached out and held up Wagner’s bag, suddenly unharmed, albeit a little scuffed.\n\n“Should… should I?”\n\nWagner almost reached out.\n\n“Fuck no!” I cried while snatching her wrist. “I’ve never seen anything like this, but Jesus Christ if it doesn’t look like a trap I don’t know what does. No. No. We need to move. We need to find the others and get the hell on with this expedition. No more notes.\n\n“Radio the others,” I added while glaring at the empty street, watching for signs of further movement behind all that dull and lifeless glass. “It’s time to move into the woods.”\n\n\\-\n\nSamantha and I were standing on the crest of the same hill where Greg had fallen over twenty years ago, only now the air was cooler and the grass greener, and plenty of birds chirruped in the nearby trees. It had seemed through no gentle twist of fate we’d been brought to the trail he’d singled out years ago.\n\n“This is definitely what the satellite picked out?” I asked while Samantha chewed anxiously on her thumb.\n\n“This is the route,” Wagner replied. “Why is there something wrong with it? It’s just that the infrared and elevation scans made it clear, if we want to enter the forest this is our best bet.”\n\n“No, if you’re sure, you’re sure,” I said while briefly nudging a child’s shoe back into the long grass. I could only hope Samantha hadn’t noticed.\n\n“Come on,” one of the soldiers said while taking point. “We need to get moving or else we risk getting stuck here in the dark.”\n\n\\-\n\nThe woods were surprisingly free of snares, but for the last century the townspeople had treated it like cursed land, and it seemed so had the wildlife. No trails. No paths. No sign of intervention by humans or animals. Nothing dared to encroach on these trees, to weather down their grip on the Earth. They grew over one another like people in a jostling crowd, roots left to thicken and fight tooth and nail, crowding so tightly they burst through the soil and crawled over one another like something in a mangrove swamp. You didn’t hike through this forest, you crawled along on your hands and knees, climbing steep inclines one moment, gripping gnarled roots like the rungs of a ladder, before descending the other side in reverse.\n\n“Was this place always free of snares?” One of the soldiers asked.\n\n“Honestly… I don’t know,” I replied. Both Samantha and I had been shocked by that fact and neither of us had talked since noticing it.\n\n“No one went into the woods,” Samantha added as the same man helped her over a particularly steep set of roots. “It wasn’t even a matter of being forbidden. It was just that if you entered, you never returned.”\n\n“High stakes for a hike,” he replied. “I’m not sure I’m being paid enough to never see the sun again.”\n\n“Well we’ve walked, what? Thirty minutes? And we’re still alive,” Wagner said. “Maybe people just got lost. Nothing says…”\n\nWagner was climbing beside Sam as she spoke, only her words came to a startling halt before she could finish. She cried out, lost her footing, and tumbled backwards. But as she fell her cries grew shrill and almost hysterical, and I rushed over to help unsure of what had happened. When I reached her, she was on her back, clutching an old piece of root. In a blur, she threw it far away from herself and began to point at something inside the roots.\n\n“Fuck fuck fuck fuck…” she muttered while hyperventilating.\n\n“Oh my God!” Samantha cried as her eyes picked out what had upset Wagner.\n\nIt took a second to see it. I had crawled over that exact spot just moments ago and noticed nothing. But there it was, a moss-covered bundle of leathery and mottled skin, the features below so brutalised by decay that it was scarcely recognisable as anything that might have once skittered or skulked around these woods.\n\nA deer.\n\nDead. Desiccated. Taken years before. Poor Wagner had gripped one of its bony limbs mistaking it for a root–it was nearly identical due to the moss covering it–but only the slimy give of its skin beneath her fingers had clued her in and then once she saw those hollow eyes gazing back at her from the darkness… well it’s a wonder she hadn’t screamed the whole place down.\n\n“Looks like it died and got caught up in the tree roots,” one of the soldiers said as he took a closer look.\n\n“Do you think it touched one of the snares?” Wagner asked as she rubbed her hands clean on her trousers.\n\n“Guys…”\n\n“Does it even take animals?” Wagner added.\n\n“It can,” I replied.\n\n“Guys…”\n\n“Weren’t allowed pets because of it,” Samantha added. “Birds seemed to avoid the snares instinctively but cats, dogs, anything like that really, didn’t fair so well.”\n\n“Guys!” One of the soldiers shouted from the nearest deadfall where he peeked over the top. “I found the townspeople.”\n\n\\-\n\nThey moved. Chasing them or walking towards them was a sure way to get lost and the soldiers let us know that emphatically. We were to continue as-is, penetrating deeper into the forest in the hope of finding something, anything, that gave us answers. Meanwhile all we could do was ignore the strange figures that bobbed amongst the trees.\n\nLimp bodies.\n\nHanging arms\n\nDrooping heads. Hair full of twigs and leaves. Mouths full of soil. Moss coated skin, pallid and soft. Dead bodies suspended like puppets in twine. They didn’t run if you approached them, they merely drifted away as if the hands that controlled them were taking them off stage. This was the first time in my life I’d seen the red thread used for something other than snares.\n\nSomehow, this felt worse.\n\n“Guys,” I said after we’d marched for another hour. “I think we can safely say how that image of Greg was taken.” I gestured to one of the bodies that floated amidst the trees, its body swaying in unseen currents. “Are we sure we need to go further?”\n\n“He’s right,” one of the soldiers said as he dropped his bag and began to roll out his shoulders and back. “I don’t like this one bit. And we now know the context of that screengrab. I know I’m not paying for this whole thing but, I think it’s time to call it a day.” He reached down and grabbed the bag, ready to pull one strap over his shoulder, when we heard it.\n\n*How had we been so stupid?*\n\nThe woods had never been free of snares, it was just another way of getting us to lower our guard. When the soldier had reached for the bag his hand, bare skin even, had brushed against a snare that had appeared when our eyes were turned. A dozen brass bells rang out from the contact and slowly, joining in one by one, a thousand, a million others joined. A deafening, maddening, ear-splitting cry. The most unnatural thing I’ve ever heard in my life. Decades gone without it, but here it was once more, powerful enough to make me feel like a weeping child waiting to be grabbed by Samantha’s arms.\n\nThe soldier looked at me, terrified.\n\n“You said there weren’t any in the forest!” he cried, pale as a ghost. I began to stammer. I wanted to say we’d made no promises, that I’d only agreed with others observations, but what would that achieve!?\n\n“Calm down!” I shouted instead but he tried to run towards us. Already new snares had appeared to tangle up his feet, binding to his clothes, wrapping around his limbs from the ever-rising panic that made him thrash his limbs. The man was going to die. Destined to. It was too late. Maybe if we’d taken it slowly, reacted just right, but that ship had sailed now. He was bound in dozens of them, and as he continued to panic it only grew worse. They melted into his scalp, his cheeks, his brow, his hands and where his top rode up in the mad struggle, they now began to weld to his chest and back.\n\n“No no no no no…”\n\nHe muttered the words over and over. His friend took a step towards him but I held out a hand to stop him. What could he do? The soldier continued to thrash in fear. Anyone who got near him would end up touching a snare and there was no coming back from that. His panic made him as dangerous to us as he was to himself. We had to watch as the snares ramped up the pressure, dragging him with increasing speed up and over a cluster of roots.\n\n“Oh no…”\n\nWagner was the first to notice. The snares did not run over all the roots! They went through them, under them. Their path was a complicated weave in and out of ancient boughs and roots.\n\n“Don’t watch,” was all I managed to say as his body hit the first of many split directions. As one we turned away. Samantha scrunched her face, trying as hard as she could to shut out any and all light. Wagner clasped her hands over her ears to block out the sound of breaking bone, but there was no escaping those screams. She surely must have heard them.\n\nAnd the remaining soldier… for some reason he watched.\n\nWhen it was done there was only blood slicked tree limbs, torn and shredded clothes, and a grown man on his knees vomiting and crying from what he’d just seen. And behind us, all around us, all except for a single route ahead, the snares had returned. So many the air thrummed like a dropped guitar. So many it was hard to see further than a few metres in any direction. So many that the message they sent was clear. After all, the timing of the first snare could not have been an accident. Whatever lay them was telling us loud as it could,\n\n*There is no turning back.*\n\n\\-\n\nWe did not hear the soldier’s cries, but we heard the struggle.\n\nI’m still not sure what happened, only that by the time we turned he was one foot off the ground, his mouth a mask of twine so thick it resembled a writhing nest of earthworms. A faceless floating body, his limbs shivering from the overwhelming agony–God I hope that if you can die of pain, it at least happens quickly–and his face a quivering ever-shifting bundle of blood-red. The sight was like a nightmare, and it was all the worse that we hadn’t even seen it happen. If it hadn’t been for one of his shoes falling off as he had a seizure, we might never have even known he was gone!\n\nBut that wasn’t the worst of it. No. The worst was that he came back.\n\nWagner noticed first. She was already at the rear. When it became apparent to her that another person had floated up behind and was now just a few metres away, she mewed a desperate cry for help and Samantha and I turned in unison.\n\nThe man who’d been taken just an hour before had resumed his position at the back of the group. He bobbed along the woodland floor, but his feet did not touch the ground. If we approached, he moved away just like the others. But unlike them he was being paraded in full view, close behind to make sure we stayed on track. If we took a step, he took a ‘step’ as well, bouncing along in mock imitation of us. Whatever had happened to him in the canopy, he looked broken now. Crunched. Crumpled. Playdoh squeezed in the fist of an angry child. Sunken eyes and a toothless mouth hung low, his dislocated jaw swinging freely as saliva collected on a swollen tongue.\n\nJust like the mannequin, with a single stiff arm, the twine moved him and gestured for us to carry on.\n\n\\-\n\nAt last, after the hours had gone on for so long the sky turned a dull grey, ready for nightfall, we found it. A clearing in the woods as large as any stadium and there before us lay what I could only describe as a congregation.\n\nAnd like many great gatherings held in secret and silence, they knelt in supplication, heads pressed to the floor. Skin and hair withered away, or at least so marred by the filth around them that they were hard to tell apart. Individual identity meant little in this crowd. The clothes too were close to falling apart, but all these people on their knees, somehow their shoes still told a story. Leather boots. Brogues. Moccasins. Slippers. Trainers. Chucks. Nikes. Doc Martins. Boomers to Millennials, three generations of a town brought to their knees. Bright and colourful. Stern and businesslike. The elderly and the young alike lay before us.\n\nDead men and women praying.\n\nTo a woman bound in twine.\n\nShe was not another floating marionette. This was immediately apparent. Her features were not hidden, her skin not marred by soil. Her hair, a rich chestnut brown, was long and flowing. Her clothes, what little we could see beneath a cocoon of red twine, was a pale white gown. But time had not left her alone. Her head was a withered skull, her mouth a leering gape. A corpse as surely as any other, but free from the abuse of a life on the forest floor for she floated high amongst the trees, thousands of red snares emerging from her body to suspend her in the centre of an explosion of red lines that radiated out from her core.\n\nBeneath her lay the remnants of an ancient bonfire. Above her, the branches and canopy had been scorched black. But the woman appeared to have been untouched by flame, a ghostly image of death. She was like something out of a renaissance painting. Beautiful and haunting, otherworldly and divine. The sight of her made my heartbreak, even if I couldn’t say why.\n\n“Who is she?” Wagner asked, her voice choked with tears.\n\nAll at once, the bodies turned to face us, moving from their bowed position just enough to fix us with vacant, cloudy eyes. Greg was one of those many. I spotted him nearby, still a child. He glared at me with empty sockets that seemed darker than any shadow, like a flicker of his betrayal remained alive within him. Had he worn that furious expression for all these years?\n\nI wanted to answer Wagner’s question but the answer froze in my throat. I had no definitive proof but couldn’t see the betrayal on the woman’s face? Couldn’t she see the hatred in her hollow eyes? God being stood there, it felt wrong, felt dangerous. It felt like I’d just wandered into Chernobyl and was making direct contact with the elephant’s foot. Whoever that woman was, she radiated hate the same way the sun radiates heat. Whatever the details of her life, there was no mistaking the intensity of her contempt for us.\n\nI had spent decades wondering what force or creature could hate my town so much that it would torture us for nearly three decades. Looking at her I understood easily where that cruelty came from. A witch burned, perhaps? I’d never heard of that in our history. And who burns a witch in the nineties? But who knows what happens in the deep woods. Who knows what atrocities are committed in the dark, and so far from watching eyes? Then again, did she need justification to hate us? A part of me felt like I was standing before a god of some kind and who knows what they do or do not take offence to.\n\nAfter all, do you explain to an ant why you crush it?\n\nAs if hearing my thoughts she turned to face me. Dead but alive. Rotting but whole. And for a brief passing instant I saw enough to render the world white, for blood to come bubbling out my ears in a warm stream I wouldn’t notice for hours more. And then, after that, silence, darkness. My final thought was the realisation that I’d been right.\n\nI had just heard a god speak.\n\n\\-\n\nFrom the town came church bells. Even from where we sat on the hood of a car miles away awaiting extraction, I could see the glow in the tower. The town had come alive at last. Our journey from the woods had not been alone. Her congregation, easily a thousand rotting bodies, floated down behind us. And she came in tow, looming over all like some nightmarish puppeteer. Only when we reached the bottom of the hill and passed the first building did the woman in red move into the lead where she slowly took her congregation to the centre of the town. There she remains even now, still floating, still bound in a million threads.\n\nBut her congregation moved on.\n\nGreg returned home. My father too, hand-in-hand with my mother, the woman he’d loved so much there wasn’t much room for me. Others had work to do. Shopkeepers flipped *closed* signs to *open*. Switches were flicked. Barber’s poles came to life. Neon signs began to thrum and glow. Light flooded the nighttime streets as ancient bulbs flickered once, twice, and then finally fell into a steady hum.\n\nAll of them, lifeless bodies manipulated by the twine. Cloudy eyes. Brains as inert as a lump of insulation. And yet they were animated with just enough hints of a former life as to make me wonder what exactly the woman in red had been doing with them up there for all those years. Either way, the facsimile was shocking. If you could ignore all the snares and the strange way its citizens floated and bobbed along, the town almost appeared normal as life began to slowly flood back in.\n\nIt had been a miracle to get electricity back on so quickly. But the woman in red had brooked no argument. Her demands were many and if I hadn’t accepted them she would have boiled my brains right there in that clearing.\n\n“What happens when we die one day?” Samantha asked as we watched houses light up one by one. “What happens if there’s a power cut? She can move the cars on her own but electricity?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I replied while shaking my head, but already I was thinking of ways to install a generator. Something the twine could maybe move in emergencies, enough to keep the town going while I took care of the rest.\n\n“But I’d really rather not find out what happens if she doesn’t get her own way.”",

        "author": "firecandyy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10yz6bd/how_to_cure_your_phobia/",
        "text": "For all of my twenty-nine years of my life, I have been severely claustrophobic. I don’t mean to say that I’m a little uncomfortable in small spaces - no, what I have is absolute, overwhelming terror. Closets, basements, windowless rooms, any contained place leaves me petrified. I break into a cold sweat just by thinking of the minute elevators in the nearby department building. My brother’s college dorm, with its one small window, devolved me into a hyperventilating mess. Don’t even get me started on the time a friend thought it would be funny to send me pictures of those Hong Kong coffin apartments.\n\nDespite trying every form of exposure therapy and anti-anxiety medication, the phobia never fully subsided. So instead, I created a life around it. I rented a spacious house with plenty of big windows, blocking off the attic the day I moved in. I called restaurants ahead of time to make sure I'd sit at the main level, near an exit. I refused to go underground, especially in basements or subways, or too far *above* ground, because of the necessity of elevators. I worked from home - although that one is common nowadays! So while I swallowed my meds and logged onto my weekly teletherapy appointment (my therapist’s office was a little too “cozy” for my comfort), I never felt like I was missing out on much.\n\nOf course, that feeling changed during the nightmare of last summer. Wait - let me back up. Let me arrange my flashbulb memories into chronological order, so you can see the whole picture.\n\nWhat I mean to say is: *Everything changed when I met Lucas*.\n\nI know, I know, don’t change yourself for a man, but Lucas was the sweetest, most angelic golden-retriever-boy I’d ever met. 6 feet tall, with dreamy blue eyes and a great relationship with his mom… the total package. He was even a structural engineer! The guy was a constantly smiling ray of sunshine, and he was refreshingly fearless.\n\nHowever, Lucas also lived in a below-ground apartment.\n\nIt was just while he got started in his career - after all, since he spent so much time away at work, why pay more for a nicer place? The logic was sound, but that didn’t change the shaky feeling I had even just thinking of it. So I never went. Instead, he came over to my house.\n\nAfter a while of dating, though, I think this started to bug him. Not just the apartment thing - the fact that I’d spend ten minutes struggling up the stairs to avoid a quick elevator ride up to his office on the 21st floor. My flat-out refusal to go to his favorite bar, a basement speakeasy. The way I blew a gasket when he opened the previously untouched attic hatch on my ceiling.\n\nIt made me feel so crazy, so ashamed - the look of disappointment and confusion on his usually-cheerful face. So one night, when Lucas hesitantly pitched an idea over dinner, I forced myself to swallow my terror.\n\n“Maybe we could do our own kind of exposure therapy? I’ll help you, and you can take your meds all you want. We’ll go slow, Jane, I promise. Just so you can try and live a normal life.”\n\nA normal life. God, this unsure proposal was the first time I felt I wasn’t “normal” already. The realization pierced me like a spear through the heart.\n\nBut his big blue eyes, full of hope, gave me the tiniest ounce of courage.\n\n“Okay.” My voice was just a whisper, and he lunged around the table to envelope me in a hug.\n\nOur “therapy” began the next day. Lucas had apparently done quite a bit of reading up on phobias, and he decided the best thing to start with would be simply closing the blinds to the windows in my house.\n\nI sat in the living room with shaking hands, staring at the carpet, as I watched the dancing sunny reflections start to dim.\n\n“Practice your breathing exercises,” Lucas urged.\n\nI’d almost forgotten about them. Obediently, I put my shoulders back and placed my tongue on the roof of my mouth.\n\n*In. 2. 3. 4.*\n\n*Hold. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.*\n\n*Out. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.*\n\nI needed to focus on my air moving in and out of my lungs. Not the fact that it was starting to feel like the walls were closing in.\n\nShaking my head to clear my mind, I looked around. The walls appeared darker, giving the room a tighter appearance than it did in the light. The windows were shrouded in black, only a faint light emanating from the edge of the blinds.\n\nLucas had completely shaded the first floor now. Every time I exhaled, I could feel the breath being squeezed from my lungs. Like my entire body was being compressed by the closing walls and darkness.\n\n*Calm down. Calm down. It’s just a cover on the window, there’s still air.*\n\nBut where was Lucas? I felt completely isolated, trapped in my own home. I stood up. “L-Lucas?”\n\nMy voice came out small and terrified. I sunk to the ground, curled into the fetal position. My head ached as if it there were tight bands around my skull, my brain being pulled inwards by some horrible gravitational force. The racing pulse of my heart made my breath skip and sputter. I squeezed my eyes closed.\n\n“LUCAS!”\n\nSuddenly, there were warm palms on my knees. “I’m right here, baby. It’s okay. You’re doing it, you’re doing it!”\n\n“Open the shades,” I begged helplessly.\n\n“Janie, open your eyes. Do the grounding exercises we talked about. What’s five things you can see?”\n\nBlinking through the tears, I saw his angelic face in front of me. “You?” I offered.\n\n“Keep going.”\n\nThe walls. The dark, threatening, compressing walls stealing my oxygen. *No, don’t think about that.*\n\n“I can… I can see the coffee table.”\n\n“What else?”\n\nI scanned the room. “The doorway. The lamp. The couch.”\n\n“What about four things you can feel?”\n\nThe rug, soft beneath my feet. His hands heating my legs. The chair I leaned back against. My arms wrapped tight around my chest. *Oh.*\n\nI loosened my grip, and felt the relief of some more air entering my lungs. Things were coming back into focus now. It was just my living room. It didn’t look too different than it did at night - just without the view from the window.\n\nLucas noticed the change and smiled his big, sunshine grin. “That doesn’t feel so scary, does it?”\n\nI had to admit that it didn’t. As scary as the experience was, when I grounded myself, I could see nothing had really changed.\n\nFrom that point on, we did daily DIY therapy. At first, I had to be the one closing the shades. Then I had to try to sit in my small bathroom with the door shut and shades down. Next, we tried walking up and down tight stairwells. That one really put me into a panic at first, but when I focused on the feeling of the cold metal handrail - and the door in front of me - it wasn’t so impossible. Or really, it didn’t seem as petrifying because I had Lucas by my side. Even when he pushed me a little harder than I thought was necessary, I trusted him. It was almost funny - this man I’d met only a couple months ago could convince me to face fears I’d avoided for almost thirty years.\n\nAnd so a few weeks into our work, Lucas decided that I had to visit his apartment. I gulped when he said it. I guess I knew that was coming, but for some reason the idea of his closed little underground place triggered my anxiety more than anything we’d tried yet.\n\n“I don’t think I’m ready yet,” I told him gently. “Why don’t we try something above ground first?”\n\n“You’re never going to feel ready, you’ve got to just make yourself do it!”\n\n“I know, but it’ll take time. I want to, I promise, but I don’t want to push too hard and make the phobia worse.”\n\nSuddenly, my boyfriend’s usually-sweet blue eyes darkened. “That’s bullshit.”\n\nShocked, I opened my mouth to respond, but was cut off.\n\n“Jane, it’s not getting any worse. That’s a cop out. I thought you were ready to make a difference in your life. I thought I was enough for you to want to make your life better. I guess I’m just not enough.”\n\nLucas ran his hand over his face. His tone changed from anger to defeat, and he turned away from me.\n\n“Of course you’re enough! You’re perfect! I’m just… I’m just… I’m scared.”\n\nI grabbed his shoulder and turned him around, embracing him. He didn’t move.\n\n“So you’ll try?” Lucas asked, his voice quiet and cool.\n\nI wasn’t sure I’d agreed to that, but he’d been right to push me in the past, hadn’t he? “I… I guess so.”\n\nLucas’ arms encased me in his warmth, and my joyful partner had returned.\n\nThe next day, after taking my medication with a steaming cup of chamomile tea, I stood outside his apartment with shaky legs.\n\nThe front door was down five stairs, each one bringing me further to the small, coffin-like basement that I imagined awaited me. I got down one before stopping and sitting on the step, heart racing. Lucas’ voice came from behind the door. “You can do this, baby!”\n\nBut I couldn’t. It was as if every cell in my body, every minute atom, was screaming at me to run and never look back. I watched a dead leaf fall down by the door where I could never go, and I couldn’t help but weep.\n\nEventually, Lucas came out, unsmiling and holding a glass of juice. He stiffly presented it to me, and I thirstily gulped it down, exhausted by the ordeal.\n\n“Let’s go home,” I sighed.\n\nLucas looked frustrated all of a sudden, his eyes darkening just as they had the night before. “But you’re almost there, Jane! Stop crying, you just need to push yourself.”\n\nHis irritation provoked my own. “I am! I’ve spent thirty years with this phobia, Lucas, it’s not going to go away over night. I’m sorry if that disappoints you, but I’m not going to be pushed into doing anything else that I don’t want to do!”\n\nAt that, my boyfriend exploded. “That you don’t want to do? So now you don’t want to be with me? You don’t want to live a normal life?”\n\n“I’m happy with my life!” I yelled.\n\n“YOU SHOULDN’T BE! I mean, look at you, Jane! You’re like, *stunted*. Before you met me, you weren’t progressing at all!”\n\nThe sting from his words took a second to hit me. But after a moment of appalled silence, I got up and left. There was nothing else to say.\n\nIt was about fifteen minutes later, whilst storming back to my house, that I realized I felt… off. My surroundings seemed blurry, the sky too bright, and I couldn’t seem to focus on any of it. My mind was full of static, my body becoming unbearably heavy. I suddenly had an overwhelming urge to close my eyes.\n\nAnd I was barely conscious when a black sedan drove up next to me, and familiar arms dragged my limp form into the trunk.",

        "text": "\n\nBefore starting this story, I highly suggest reading my previous post that states the rules for surviving the night shift at the call centre. This post will make a lot more sense afterwords.\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/10vz7wp/rules_for_the_call_centre_night_shift/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\n\n\n\nMy name is u/kinky_boy69, and I'm a first year college student in Tokyo, Japan. \n\nI recently shifted to a new building complex and took an apartment for rent, but 3 months later the owner had to move in for reason blah blah blah and I had to move out. But, thankfully he didn't leave me homeless, and offered me another apartment on the ninth floor, apartment 999. \n\nThis had me confused, because even though there were 10 apartments a floor, they usually followed the format 100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109. So it was very weird to find apartment 999 and not apartment 909.\n\nBut being a homeless and broke college student, I decided to leave my paranoia with my old apartment and accept whatever came my way. Apartment 999 was going to be my new home. \n\nThis brings me to today, the movers and packers had just finished shifting my luggage to my new apartment, I hadn't even seen this apartment from the inside yet, but from what id heard it was to be better than my old apartment. My old apartment had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and a living, this was way more than enough for me as I was living alone and didnt really invite people over. \n\nAs I was about to enter my new home I saw the landlord outside and had an.... Interesting conversation with him. \n\n\"Maa, ichiyo kiyotsukete,ne\" (Well be careful for one, okay) \n\n\"Heh? Nande? \" (What? Why?) \n\n\"Sorewa... Miruba wakaru. \" (Well.... You'll understand when you see) \n\n\"Sou desuga.... Nanka kowakunarimashita\" (I see... I'm kind of scared now) \n\n\"Hahahaha soitsu wa ii koto da\" (That's a good thing) \n\n\"Sumimasen-? \" (Excuse me-?) \n\nBut before I could get an answer my landlord was inside the elevator and waving goodbye. Weird. \n\n*that was red flag number 1*\n\nNow as I was standing right in front of my new apartment, ready to enter it and spend all day doing with it what I wish, I got a call from my boss. \n\n\nI work the evening shift at an American company called *Rodeo Electronics* and mainly handle their calls and customer service. My shift usually starts at 6 and ends by 9:45pm. The store stays shut from 9:45 to 10:00 so I've never really gotten to see who works the night shift. Anyway, back to the call from my boss. \n\n\"Ahh u/kinky_boy69-kun! Warui kedo ima hatarakenaikana? Kanade-san wa na.... \" He basically asked me to fill in a shift for a coworker Kanade-san. Kanade Hana is my senpai(senior) at this company and honestly the prettiest existence in this world. She is always nice and kind and her smile lights up the room. This kanade-san calling in sick? Impossible. \n\n*this was red flag number 2*\n\nMy boss asked me to fill in for the night shift but as I had work to complete for my college courses, I kindly rejected his offer. He said he would pay me 6x my hourly wage for covering the shift but if there's one thing I've learned from being a broke college student, it's that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. \n\nOkay, now back to the apartment. I whipped out my ginourmous nine inch co- sorry I meant keys and opened my house door. \n\n\"Uwaaaa sugeee\" (Wowww amazinggg) was ny only reaction to this absolute beaut of an apartment. It had 3 bedrooms and a study, a living room the size of my old apartment and a well furnishes kitchen! The only thing was that there was only one bathroom in the apartment. \n\n*that was red flag number 3, if something is too good to be true, it probably is.*\n\nThat's when, after keeping my handhelds down on the living room table, I found a note. \n\n. \n\n* Howdy chump! \n\nI'm so sorry to do this to you but you're the idiot who thought renting an apartment with the number 999 was a good idea. So listen up, you may think you're living alone but you're not. From now on you will have a roommate, a room mate named Ana! \n\nNow see, ana is a little special, but she's our pride and joy here at Rodeo Electronics. So if you do anything to upset her and she does retaliate, you will not come out alive and neither will your family. \n\nThat being said, here's some rules to make sure everything goes hiddy-ho between the two of you! \nDo note, refer to rule number if anything goes wrong or if you miss any steps. \n\n1) Ana will be out of the house between times 9: 50pm and 6am. You MUST say goodbye and welcome back to her both times. And you must completely bow down in a submissive position. She will dissapear after you do so, and will go for her shift. \n\n2) do not, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, look ana in her face. She will not have her makeup on and will not appreciate someone looking at her in her messes up state. \n\n3) Ana will not interact with you. On the off chance she does, it will be because you made her mad. In that case just say your prayers. \n\n4) ana will be in her room most of the time. And she will cry a lot. Very loudly. If you react to it in any way shape or form, consider yourself dead. \n\n5) ana has your phone number. And once at about 5pm every day she will call you. Be sure to pick up her call and tell her exactly what you are doing and where you are that exact moment. \n\n6) after you do so, within your proximity 1 person will have a cardiovascular failiure. You must watch them die. Interfering with ana's work may turn you into her next victim. \n\n7) Ana will walk around the house twice a day. Those 2 times that she does, you will see her. But you won't see her, what you will see is- the first time, the person you love the most in this world. The second time, the person you hate the most in this world. \n\n8) while she is moving, if you so much as make a sound, consider yourself dead. \n\n9) there is no escape. You must live in this apartment for a minimum of 33 days. You're stuck. \n\n10)the event of having to read this should only occur if you fucked up. If you have, then don't worry, you will be completely safe! But, the day after you disobey the rules, one person you care about will die. The next day another two will die, the next another three, until on day 7, you are the victim. \n\nGood luck chump!*\n\n. \n\nAs I held this note I started to tremble all over. My world began spinning at my feet and I started feeling light headed. And then I heard it. The crying. It sounded shallow, like the heart of the creature singing it. It sounded like what I imagined to be the cries of lost souls from hell. It sounded bad enough for me to write this. \n\n\n*Help me*",

        "text": "It's been over a decade since I worked at the last video rental store in my town. It finally closed down when COVID hit. It had been limping along for years after all the Blockbusters had closed. It was a small, cramped shop, but it had a familiar and cozy feel to it. Every day, I'd see the same customers come in and browse through our limited selection of DVDs and Blu-Rays, but there was one customer in particular who stood out.\n\nHe'd always come in right before we closed, usually around 11 pm. He was tall, with a pale complexion and dark hair, and he always wore a long, black coat that reached down to his ankles. He had a strange stillness about him, and his eyes were always hidden behind dark sunglasses, even at night. I always remember he would come in with these stringy and frayed earbuds in. He would be dead to the world, just focusing on the next movie he would check out. \n\nAt first, I didn't think much of him. He'd check out a few DVDs and leave, never speaking a word. But then, I started to notice something odd about the movies he was renting. They were all horror films, but not the kind you would normally expect. He would always manage to find these obscure films that I had never heard of. Some of them were even banned  in several countries for their graphic violence and disturbing content. I started looking into the films he would check out once I started noticing the banned films. They had barcodes and all of the data in our system but I never remember seeing them on the shelves. \n\nI tried to brush it off, thinking it was just a coincidence, but as the nights went on, the films he rented became increasingly disturbing. He started to check out snuff films, cannibal holocaust-style movies, and eventually he was checking out films that weren’t even popping up on google when I searched them. One night, I decided to check some of those films out just to see what was on them. I was disturbed beyond belief to find out that they were home-made footage of what looked to be real-life depictions of murders and torture. At least I hoped they were fake. They had titles like “The Smile of Innocence” which was a video of an old man in a dirty diaper chained to a radiator in a dirt floor basement crying for 35 minutes, “The Enchanted Forest” which was just a video of a guy walking through the woods for an hour before coming across a house and the video stopped and “Whispers in the Dark” which showed a video of a static shot of a room where a woman was beaten repeatedly over the course of a 40 minute window. I am sure there were more but I am going to be honest with you, I have spent the better part of a decade trying to forget what I saw on those DVDs. \n\nOne night, I was closing up the shop when I heard a strange noise coming from the back room. I had already locked the doors so I should have been the only one there.  I cautiously approached and peered inside to find the mysterious customer at the counter, putting DVDs on our shelves to be checked out. I watched in horror as he placed the labels and movie covers onto the DVD cases. He had been adding them to the collection while no one was in the store. How he got in, I will never know. \n\nI tried to confront him, but he simply turned to me with a smirk and said, \"Don't worry, these movies will bring the customers flocking back.\" He started laughing to himself as he continued labeling the films. \n\nI immediately called the police, but by the time they arrived, the man was gone, leaving behind the disturbing DVDs on our shelves. I never saw him again after that night. Hell, I only worked at the video store for a few more weeks after that before I quit. \n\nIt's been years since that night, and I still can't shake the feeling that he's still out there, watching me or something. The strange thing is, I work at a library now. Circulation desk and when I was checking in books and DVDs the other day, I saw that someone had returned a DVD copy of “Whispers in the Dark.” The cover was faded but legible and it had a library barcode. I scanned it in and immediately went to my boss to give them my two week notice. I can’t go through this again.  I hope this post finds its way to someone who can finally shed some light on this. Has anyone else come across this guy or videos like this? I feel like I am being targeted.",

I’ve stayed around on full moons before and I’ve never seen it try to attack me. Piss me off? Sure. Seems to be its favorite pastime. But never like this.”\n\n“Some form of hazing, perhaps?  Or maybe he was offended by the flat beer?” \n\nMartina scoffed. \n\n“He never touches the beer. Thinks he’s fucking hilarious, remember?”\n\n“Only too well. Listen, I’m sure you had this thought before, but don’t you think this thing is clearly a werewolf? Full moon? Silver? Vicious carnivore?”\n\nShe shrugged. “Probably. What does it matter?”\n\n“Because he could be anyone outside the full moon! Just walking around.”\n\n“What do you want to do, hand him a bill? Serve him with a lawsuit?”\n\n“You’re not at least a bit curious?”\n\n“Not at all. Have enough on my plate and one day a lunar cycle is about all I can handle of this asshole. Now, come on. Let’s start cleaning this up.”\n\nIn my previous life, I had worked basic desk jobs so the manual labor aspect of owning the property was painfully new to me. We spent hours hauling away the fragments of wood and metal destroyed by the beast into the dumpster behind the motel office. We buried the remains of the deer in a ditch at the end of the property that Martina had been using for that purpose for ages. Sometimes there were remains, she explained, and other times the entire animal would be taken. \n\nI was so winded and achy after we finally finished that I wanted to just lay on the ground and never get up. For Martina, however, it was all in a day’s work, even though as far as I could tell, the woman subsisted entirely on cigarettes and hamburgers. She was examining the walls of my cottage with concern.\n\n“Now what?” I wheezed. \n\n“Pretty deep claw marks. Lots of cracking.”\n\n“Ugh, seriously? Do you think there might be issues with the structural integrity of the cottage?”\n\n“Not sure. We’ll have to see what the carpenter says. In the meantime, maybe you should check out the condition of Cottage 7 next door. If it’s in decent shape, you might want to move in until we can get a professional’s opinion. And before you give me that look, Cottage 7 is perfectly normal.”\n\n“No taxes owed on that one? Fine. Makes sense. Probably not great to get crushed in my sleep by a collapsing cottage.”\n\n“Not the way I’d want to go.”\n\nCottage 7 was the cottage closest to my own and from the exterior appeared to be in good shape. Porch screen was a little warped, but otherwise intact. I stepped into the main room of the cottage.  Furniture and decorations from the late 90s, but also seemed okay. I flipped the faucet on and off, checked the fridge, flushed the toilet—all in functioning order. After my uncle closed down the motel, there was minimal upkeep to the cottages, enough that they wouldn’t fall into complete disrepair. I would have to do a good deep cleaning, but it could work. \n\nI sat down in one of the chairs at the small dining table and felt the rug underneath it dip. *That’s not a good sign.* I got down, carefully moved the chair and the rug, and promptly groaned.\n\nThe wooden floorboards were warped and clearly rotting. As I bent down to get a better look, I heard a faint scratching from inside.\n\n“How’s it going in there? I brought you a sandwich.” Martina looked in and shook her head when she saw me on the floor.”\n\n“Excellent,” I gestured to the rotting boards.  “This and a side of rodents.”\n\n“Add it to the list, I guess.” She sighed. “By the way, another scheduled payment today.” She tossed me the notebook.\n\n“Cottage 14.”\n\n“Ah, almost in the woods, that one.”\n\nShe pointed to the entry.\n\n*Number 14*\n\n*Lay down in the center of the room.* *Do not speak to them.* *Leave when they are gone.* *Can be satisfied at any time either day or night.* \n\n*Payment schedule: Every three months*\n\n“Okay, my first reaction is that this doesn’t sound too bad.”\n\nMartina pursed her lips skeptically.\n\n“It’s going to be terrible, isn’t it?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“The only good thing about this one is that you can do it either day or night. It’s pitch black in there anyway. Do it during the day, trust me.”\n\n“I know I don’t have a good track record of things going to plan, but what am I in for?”\n\n“First of all, I don’t know what these things are, so don’t bother asking. There are a lot of them. Let’s call them ghosts, maybe that’s the best fit. Who knows. As I said, it’s dark in there, and there’s no furniture so don’t worry about bumping into anything. Just lay on the floor and wait. They’re basically harmless. I think they just forget what a human feels like. You’ll see. It’s awful, but manageable. Before you know it, they’re gone and you can just go about your business.”\n\n“Hmmm. Great. I guess I should get it over with.”\n\nCottage 14 was set back against the edge of the property, facing a forest that was green and plush in the summer. Now, the branches that nearly engulfed the porch were wan and desolate. *Certainly adds ambience*. There was something about the structure that seemed sadder than the others. Perhaps it was the paint that had faded to a dull, filthy grey. The scrollwork of the gable trim appeared brittle and delicate, as though it would crumble before my eyes. In fact, the entire place had an air of impermanence, though it had been standing in this exact spot for a century.\n\nWhen I stepped on the porch, the whispers began. They came from inside, faint yet almost excited. I took a deep breath and entered the cottage. Martina was right—it was pitch black, unnaturally so, like stepping into a velvet box. I could feel the floor under me, but that was the only tether for my senses. There was no indication of the windows, and with a stab of fear I noticed I could no longer see the door behind me. The only thing I could do was carefully lower myself to the floor, that physical action almost comforting in the nothingness. I pressed my hand against the wood, anchoring me to something earthly.\n\nIt did not take the denizens of the cottage long to find me. I felt a hand clasp my ankle tentatively, but saw nothing. I suppressed a gasp. More hands joined the first, firmly but not painfully squeezing my arms, shoulders, legs. The whispering gradually increased, but was still soft, barely louder than the gentle rustling of leaves. Just when the rhythm of hands on my limbs became almost relaxing, the hands started touching my face. Invisible, cold fingers combed themselves through my long hair, pressing their palms against my forehead, tracing my lips.  One hand clamped itself over my mouth over and over, then doing the same to my nose, as if trying to understand the warmth of my breath. I couldn’t count them, but they were many, all grasping at me like they had never seen a human made of flesh and bone.\n\nAmidst the whispering, there were words that I could detect here and there. Not English words, French perhaps, yes, yes, *cheveux* and maybe *jeune*. I do not speak French, but could catch the simple vocabulary. \n\nHands began to push at my back. A pair took my arms, another pushed my legs from behind and this time the whispers were right next to my ears.  *Levez, levez, stand!*  Hands pushed at the soles of my shoes, raising me into nothingness. I felt clammy, almost numb at the loss of that last sensory connection.\n\nI opened my mouth to protest, but remembered the admonition of the notebook. All around me, shadowy forms took shape, delineated from the blackness by weak, white light that illuminated the figures like silhouette portraits. They were humans, but practically formless, bent and wraithlike. One stood taller in the center and began to speak to me, in a crackling, parched voice, perhaps that of a woman, but I could not understand. It was French again, but spoken quickly and far beyond my extremely meager capabilities. I didn’t dare speak to ask if there was any way she could *parlez anglais*. \n\nThe leader placed its hand over my heart. She spoke again, a flurry of words I could not understand but carried the intensity of a warning, then a phrase that sounded like “*ne te laisse pas seule.*” \n\nSuddenly, the spirits around me writhed in pain, the once pale light that had surrounded them intensifying, whipping upwards like flames. I was surrounded by screaming, human screaming, the screaming of hundreds of people. I could feel hot sparks against my skin, underneath my clothes, pricking, escalating into burning. Smoke filled my nostrils, my lungs, and, gasping, I clawed at the air, reaching for the spirits who themselves were reaching beyond me. I fell and there were no hands to catch me. \n\nMy body hit the wood floor and the spirits and their flames were gone. The darkness was just the ordinary darkness of a cottage shuttered against the daylight, the door and my escape outlined in the vibrant orange of early evening. I scrambled towards it, nearly tripping over my own feet, skin still flushed and hot. I flung the door open and let out a cry of relief as the cold freshness enveloped me. \n\nMartina was waiting, seated in the folding chair she used for fishing, wrapped in her favorite cat blanket.\n\n“I know I’m beginning to sound like a broken record, but what the fuck!”  I said breathlessly.\n\nMartina stood, wrapping her blanket around her shoulders, and surveyed my appearance.\n\n“I’m guessing your experience was …unusual.”\n\n“Just a bit. Do you by any chance speak French?”\n\nShe glared at me.\n\n“Okay, okay, I had to ask. I know the notebook mentions not speaking, but you never said I’d be spoken to!”\n\n“Because they’ve never spoken to me. I lay there, they squeeze my hands and feet in total darkness and that’s about it. Some experiences are longer than others, but that’s the only variation.”\n\n“You’ve never seen them, then?”\n\nMartina blanched. \n\n“They showed themselves to you?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“And spoke to me. In French. I don’t think it was necessarily hostile, but there was anger there. Misery. The only thing I could catch sounded like, *don’t let yourself be alone.* And then it was as though they all were set on fire, and I too felt the flames, the smoke.”\n\nMartina folded her arms as if beset by a sudden chill.  \n\n“Something has changed around here. And I don’t like it one bit.” She narrowed her eyes against the sun that had just dipped below the horizon. \n\n“It felt like I was in there for no longer than ten minutes, but from the look of the sky I guess it’s been—”\n\n“Hours,” she finished, nodding. “That’s why I like to get in there and get it over with while it’s still day. Come on, we should probably grab a couple of crowbars and see what kind of mice colony we have under the floor in Cottage 7. After my visits there,” she gestured disapprovingly at the cottage I had just left, “I typically enjoy whacking things with tools. Just good, honest work. Keeps your mind off things.”\n\n“You’re right, that does sound amazing right about now.”\n\nWe walked back towards the river and Cottage 7, happy to leave the image of the burning spirits behind me. I’ve never been so grateful for the frosted crunch of winter grass under my boots, for the faint stinging of my lips chapped by the cold breeze. And the most precious thing of all, the air in my lungs, that magic so desired by the dead.\n\n“Martina?”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\n“Have you ever thought about…burning the place down?”\n\nShe laughed.\n\n“Not my place to burn down! But I’ve had my fantasies.”\n\nThe clouds were rapidly darkening from mauve to the steel of night. I tried to envision everything around me in flames, crumbling into ash.\n\n“Should I do it?”  I asked.\n\n“Do you want to?”\n\n“No, I don’t think I do.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Listen, Nora. I’ve had a lot of time to think about this. And while I still have no idea what these things are or who put them here, I am almost certain that this place, our taxes, our constant payments for their appeasement, all these things bind them to this place.  If it were gone, I…” She trailed off.\n\n“Yeah, I wouldn’t want to know either.”\n\nMartina had left a pile of tools in front of Cottage 7. I grabbed a sledge hammer.\n\n“A fine weapon of choice. Start tapping in the rotting bits of wood, then I’ll come in with the prybar and grab the nails.”\n\nWe carefully moved the table and chairs out of the way. I rolled up the worn rug. There were a lot more rotting boards than I had noticed earlier that day. The scratching sounds underneath the floor had intensified.\n\n“Mice always making a racket at night,” Martina muttered.\n\n“Shall I?” I waved the hammer.\n\n“Go ahead. Just start with a firm but careful tap. That’s probably all you’ll need.”\n\nI obeyed. The wood crumbled all too easily. The scratching stopped. I brushed away the decaying wood and my fingers brushed something solid and dry. I recoiled in disgust.\n\n“We might have a dead one.” I grimaced. I took out my phone and put on the flashlight to get a better view. My heart leapt into my throat.\n\n“It’s…it’s…” I pointed with a trembling finger.\n\n“Well I’ll be damned,” Martina said as she bent down. She cleared away the remainder of the dust. It was a human hand, desiccated and curled, connected to the rest of an arm that was almost skeletal, covered with a thin layer of skin and dried sinew.\n\n“What…in heaven’s name, is a *human body* doing under the floorboards.”\n\n“Looks like it’s been here awhile.” Martina worked quickly, knocking out the boards surrounding the rest of the corpse. It was the body of a man, by the looks of it, rags of clothing sticking to its almost entirely mummified remains. The face appeared contorted, but remarkably preserved, sunken eyes staring at us accusingly, the remains of lips still tightly covering the mouth.\n\n“Must have been buried when these cottages were built, about one hundred years ago. As far as I know, these floors have never been replaced.”\n\n“Maybe there’s some form of identification on him,” I asked. At least part of what appeared to be trousers seemed intact. I reached toward the pocket, thinking there could be a wallet or some other clue.\n\nWith a cracking lurch the bony arm shot forward and clasped my shoulder with an awful strength pulling both me and itself upright with a sickening hiss. The eyes bored into me, dead and corpselike, yet somehow *alive*. It began to open its mouth with an appalling click.  I tore at its grip, twisting my face as far away as I could, using my entire weight to knock it off balance, but to no avail. \n\nMartina brought her prybar down on its side, shouting and cursing. The thing let out an angry moan and threw me aside like a ragdoll. My body made contact with the table, flipping it over and on top of me. For a moment I blacked out, exploding with pain. My vision returned to me and I saw the thing clutch Martina and lift her to its mouth with a frenzied shriek, tearing into her throat. With all my might I pushed the table aside, head spinning, weeping, crying Martina’s name. She slackened in its grip and in an instant the thing bounded out the door of the cottage and into the night.\n\nI managed to crawl out of the wreckage of the furniture. Martina lay silent on the floor, eyes staring ahead, skin a deathly gray. *Lifeless.*\n\n“No, no,” I whispered. I tried to bring my shaking fingers to her neck to check for a pulse, but…I could not find any skin intact. I screamed as I cradled her to me.  \n\nI screamed long and hard enough for every damned creature, every bloodthirsty revenant to hear.",

        "text": " \n\nHey everybody, my last post was just a few days ago but a lot has happened since then, Monsters being slaughtered in unimaginable ways i didn’t think were possible. All done by the same being, Timeo himself. I went to Lucifer with no luck, he’s afraid of him, which is saying alot coming from the devil himself. My only chance to find out how to stop this threat is go to the big man in the sky himself: Yahweh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI aligned the salt into a circle around me and lit the candles properly, I sat in the center and cleared my mind. I felt myself falling into darkness before not being able to breathe, I opened my eyes and found myself looking at a light above me. I felt myself drawing so I swam to the surface to see a kingdom enveloped in light. I brushed myself off and began to walk towards the gates to see St Peter with a key. “Tessa? Long time no see! How are things down there?” He asked with a smile on his face. “You didn’t hear, did you?” I asked, he looked at me concerned. “They never tell me anything, I only let people into heaven here. I don't question much afterwards.” he replied, a look of concern growing on his face. “I need to speak to the high council here, the archangels, somebody, anybody.” I pleaded, he nodded and let me in, “I must warn you they all seem rather busy as of lately.” He said, opening up the large golden gates. I walked through to see large open meadows of grass with bright vibrant flowers, kids and young adults picked fruit from bright green trees and two rivers ran alongside a glossy brick path to the kingdom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walked through the doors into the small city, it looked like that of New York but there was no misery, only happiness and hope. I wanted to stay, but knew I had to help the monsters that were being slaughtered. This is bigger than them and it's bigger than me as well, I need to go up to the top and see if they can stop this madness before it escalates beyond monsters. I arrived at the house. The creator, yahweh, god, whatever he goes by when it comes to you. His house was humble, a simple log cabin next to a large lake with birds perched along the shore. I sighed as I began to walk to his door. I knocked on the door three times and heard walking. He slowly opened the door. “Tessa, my child! What a lovely surprise, how are you feeling today?, I kid, please come inside this is very important,” He said. He wore a coat similar to that of a lumberjacks with a short brown beard and short hair spiked up in the front. I nodded as I stepped inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis house had a warm feeling, I mean he was god so why wouldn’t it? He pulled out 2 small kitchen chairs and turned them into arm chairs. “Please sit down with me Tessa, we have a lot to discuss.” He sat down and pulled two mugs of coffee out of nowhere and offered me a cup, it was always exactly the way I liked it. His smile quickly faded as he used his hand to pull a coffee table into existence where he laid out a piece of paper. “I know why you’re here, it's Timeo.” He said, his expression dead serious, I leaned in. “Can you ring him in? I mean obviously he’s one of yours-” God cut me off “He’s not one of mine, I think you need to really know my origin. The genesis of this world, and its surrounding universe.” he said, his tone dead serious. “I’m ready,” I said after a moment of silence. He nodded as he began to explain his origin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Billions of years ago, before the creation of this universe there was nothing but darkness, no light, no nothing. No singular cell could survive in this nothingness, except for me. I was formed into being and my birth caused the big bang, for the next few billion years I would shape the cosmos for there to be light no matter where you looked. It wasn’t enough though, in the back of my mind I knew something else was there. It lurked in the shadows and never showed itself, but I knew its intentions, its goals to complete when I was finished. Eventually the fear of me being alone with this thing was too much so I made animals to keep me comfort, to ensure I could calm myself knowing I could go to these innocent beings and be happy and avoid the thing lurking in space. Eventually I made Adam and Eve, and when I did the tree of genesis formed, its apples were filled with the thing that I feared. So I warned them, I told them to never eat the apples or they would feel the fear I did. I didn’t want humanity to suffer but- It wasn’t Lucifer who tempted Eve that day, it was Timeo. He tempted her into eating the fruit and she did, so out of fear I cast them out to not infect the others with this fear, but it was already too late.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Over the next thousand years I kept trying to limit the spread of his influence, I did terrible things to try and keep him at bay. I tried to make it up to them when they came here but I can never forgive myself for the things I did, sending my son to cleanse the fear from them only to fall to it himself.” he teared up and rested his head in his hands, “How do we beat him?” I asked, he looked at me with dry eyes, “we can’t, I can’t. Best I can think of is to prevent him from taking too much control, do not let fear influence your decisions” He said, sipping from his cup. “Is that all? This guy is out there murdering monsters and your advice is to not let him influence my decisions? Can you do anything?”I asked, he looked up at me with tears in his eyes, “he was here wasn’t he?” he nodded, I took a step back, feeling panic rising in the back of my chest. “Archangel Michael was put in critical condition from his attack but he managed to thwart him off, he’s lucky angels can’t die.” He looked at me, he grabbed my arm and imbued a rose vine like tattoo across my forearm. “Look to it when you’re in his presence to feel comfort,”he said, I smiled as he waved his hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shot out from the salt circle, when I did I heard a distinct tapping on the windows of my kitchen, I knew what it was. It was an alternate, I looked outside to see myself staring back, an impossibly wide grin and wide expressionless eyes. Its jaw was hanging open as its arms were to its side. I waved at it and it opened the door to come inside, “what’s your name?” I asked it, it tilted its head and started to move its jaws to form letters. “My…. Name… Does…. Not… Matter” its voice came out like static, it was clearly difficult for it to speak. “So I’m assuming you all were displaced with that new being on the rise?” I asked, slowly nodding, “so why come here?” “To… Seek… Help,,,\"\"You won’t get any here, I spoke with Yahweh, this threat is older than him \"\"What… Is… his… Name…?””Timeo, his name is Timeo, he killed one of my clients when I met him. Saying he would make humanity be put back on the food chain””I…Know…Him…” “You do?” I asked, leaning forward to look it in the eyes. It nodded its head slowly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe alternate turned and gestured for me to follow, I followed it into the woods where I noticed the blue mushrooms begin to glow brighter and brighter. Only to realize they were connected to antlers, the being stood up and gestured for us to walk into the hole it covered. The being looked similar to that of a water buffalo, but with massive antlers the size of the tall spruce trees surrounding us. When we walked inside I saw several monsters and creepy story characters, some you might know, some you might not. At the front of the group was an injured skin walker missing his arm, his eyes glowed yellow and his antlers were snapped off brutally. Behind him stood the rake, long horse, the cartoon cat, and a severely injured slenderman. “I can’t believe you guys survived, I thought you 4 would be high profile targets due to your fame.” I said in disbelief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We were able to get away from him thanks to the skinwalkers and alternates,” Cartoon cat said, Slenderman nodded as the alternates worked to seal the door shut. “Oh I’m afraid nobody can get away from me” Said a familiar voice, I turned around and was frozen in fear. There sitting in the empty chair was Timeo. “How did you get in here?” I asked, he laughed as he took a puff of a cigar. “You know I can't understand how you people can smoke these things, all they do is make me cough” He laughed, the remaining skinwalkers huddled around the surviving monsters, the alternates stood guard, grabbing short swords. He smiled and poured a cup of tea for himself, “I hope you know one thing, everyone else says’ it’s nothing personal’, but for me? Oh it is very, very personal, how long has society worried about things that couldn’t hurt them? The dark? The boogeyman? No more, society shouldn’t be wasting away! It's time to have fun with my new toys.” He smiled as he sipped his tea, I looked at the vine tattoo on my arm and immediately felt safe again. An alternate grabbed him from behind and threw him to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Interesting” he said, immediately recovering back to his stance. He grabbed the alternate and in a split second it burned into ash, Slenderman extended his tendrils and tried to restrain him but immediately got pulled in and had his throat slit. I watched in horror as the monsters I had come to know and love over the years were mercilessly slaughtered, an alternative threw me out of my trance and began to drag me out of the hideout. “Come…On…We…Can…get..to…safety..” It said, showing the emotion of fear even though its mouth was stuck in a grin. All of a sudden it was impaled and dragged back by Timeo, I was alone, the woods grew tall around me as the night enveloped it into darkness. I Began to panic as I heard all of the animals silence themselves. An apple fell down next to me, it was jet black. “Take the bite Tessa, see what Eve and Adam saw when they took that bite, you know you want to.” He chuckled from the distance, I crawled myself against a tree as I saw his silhouette appear and disappear throughout the low hanging fog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked away and looked back to find his face inches from mine, a massive smile on his face. I tried to run but my legs were numb with fear, I began to crawl away as he slowly walked over me. That same smile on his face, his clothes were covered in monster blood, he bent down to get to my level. “You know something Tessa, this is fun for me. The thing about you is I need you alive, because you’re the only mortal being who has a connection to Yahweh. And I’ll come visit you every night if I need to, because he is the one I need to complete my plan. Now you are going to warn him, tell him I will not be so kind to his people, on humanity if he doesn’t give me what I need.” He said, “Piss off!” I screamed, he laughed “You think I care if you want to do this or not? I only need you as leverage, someone he knows he can’t let down.” Timeo said, picking me up and setting me up on a tree stump, still frozen in fear. “What the fuck do you want?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Simple really, his kingdom”",

He mimicked tossing one down the shaft and made an explosion sound with his mouth. I hobbled to the truck still using the bolt cutter as a crutch. I tossed the cutters into the woods and climbed into the truck, making my way to the back. I grabbed my beloved Remington 870 and hobbled my way back to the opening. I stuck the barrel between the gap in the door as dozens of Wiowalk hands reached up. I fired and fired and fired, emptying all but one shell into the opening. You could hear the nine 32 caliber balls ricochet around the shaft and hit into their soft flesh. I looked at Mairo.\n\n“There is your hand grenade, five rounds of double ought buck.” I started to reload the shotgun from the side saddle. “Shotguns are like pigs. You have to feed them constantly or else they are useless.” I said.\n\nMairo poked his head inside the generator room and let out a whistle. “What happened here?”\n\nI replied with, “One of them got in there and tore the place up while fighting me. It snapped the control lever and tore up the hydraulic line for the brakes. Once the pressure was lost, the brakes released.” A few moments later Mairo came out holding a small device with a power cord hanging off the end of it.\n\n“This is a fuel pump. Let's drain the fuel from the generator because lord knows Coffee Candy, I mean Mark, will not need it anymore and honestly I don’t know if we are going to make it to the closest gas station.” As the small pump did its job, Mairo looked around and I stood guard. He came out with a set of keys and the lever for the elevator control. “ I found the keys for the lock,\" he said, handing them to me. Also this lever looks cut, not broken. It looks like a clean cut, not jagged like you would expect. It's the same with the hydraulic line. It looks very clean cut.\n\nI sighed and said, “Follow me.” We began to walk to the iron doors. “Look Mairo, these north woods have secrets and some secrets need to stay hidden away from everyone.” Mairo looked over at the bolt cutters as we walked past a chunk of rubber still stuck into the cutters and little beads of hydraulic fluid. In a smooth motion I picked up the bolt cutters and put them up on my shoulder. I walked over to the iron doors.\n\n“Mairo, I've seen men like him. He would not have stopped, he would keep going and do anything to make a quick buck.” I dropped the bolt cutters down the shaft and then dropped the keys for the lock. I spun facing Mario, my shotgun swinging up. The former Marine NCO looked scared as I yelled, “GUNNY DOWN!” He dropped to the deck, spun, and pulled his pistol out. I fired one round as Mairo got three off lighting fast. The rounds hit the Wiowalk as it was in midair. The shotgun round tore his flesh apart as the three pistol shots hit within a centimeter of each other, all of them head shots. I bent down to help him up. I looked at the body and looked at Mairo.\n\n“Hey buddy, what exactly was your job in the Marine Corps?” I asked.\n\n“I was a pastry chef. Just a lonely little pastry chef,” he replied. We both laughed and headed back to the truck, ready to head home.\n\nEpilogue One\n\n\\*\\*One Hour Later\\*\\*\n\nI was just tapping away on my phone when Mairo spoke up, “Hey what are you doing? You are not writing about what just happened are you?”\n\nI replied with, “Yeah, is that cool?”\n\n“Sure,” he responded.”I’ve got no problem with that. It's just my colorful vocabulary I’m worried about. I don't want people to think I’m a foul mouthed asshole.”\n\n“Oh, don’t worry Mairo. I’m changing it up to make it more appropriate for the narrator to narrate, but I’m guessing most people can figure out the curse words easily. For example, I am using the word ‘rooster‘ when in reality you say coc…” Before I could finish my sentence, the armored truck hit a pothole and I almost got launched out of my seat, despite wearing a seat belt.\n\nMario let out a laugh, “Ok, good,” he said. “I just wanted to make sure and I better not read anything in the comments section like, ‘I love Mairo.’ ‘We need more of him, he's the best,’ or ‘Mairo is my spirit animal.’ If I find out that’s the case, I will come steal your dog. Oh, you don’t have a dog? I will buy one for you and wait until you have a great bond with it and then steal it from you. Also, what are you doing listening to this at night? You should be sleeping and those curtains do not match the wall color.”\n\n“Woah, woah, woah Mairo” I said, \"Are you breaking the fourth wall in my story? I'm sorry people, he gets cranky when he doesn’t get his Crayola crayons for a snack.”\n\nMairo turned and looked at me. “Who are you talking to”\n\n“You know what? It's been a screwed up day. Let’s just focus on getting home ok.” I replied.\n\n“ You got that right,” Mario agreed. “This was more screwed up than a nun doing power squats in a cucumber field.”\n\nEpilogue Two\n\n\\*\\* Several Hours Later\\*\\*\n\nI arrived home to the sound of dogs barking and the wonderful smell of my wife’s cooking. I took a deep breath, trying to forget about the day as I walked into the house. My two Welsh Pembroke Corgis greeted me as I took one step inside. I gave them tummy rubs and walked into the kitchen. My wife, whose beauty always leaves my heart fluttering, was making dinner. I looked at her and smiled. “Did you do something with your hair?” I asked. She touched her hair, which now fell to her shoulders.\n\n“Yeah, I just got a trim,” she laughed. She looked at me and said,\n\n“Hey babe, what happened to your vest?”\n\n“Oh, yeah I lost it in an underground lake. It was kind of a sink or swim situation,\" I responded, with a light chuckle in my voice.\n\n“Well dinner is ready. Spaghetti and breadsticks, one of your favorites.” We sat down and enjoyed the quiet meal. “So how was your day?” She asked.\n\n“I fought some Native American demon monsters in a mine today. How about you?”\n\n“Sounds exciting,” she replied. “I think I met the actual devil today. We live a pretty exciting life, don’t we?” We both laughed, happy to be safe at home.\n\nEpilogue Three\n\n\\*\\* Two Weeks Later \\*\\*\n\nAn old mint green pickup truck drove down the old dirt road with the wind whistling through the one inch hole in the roof of the truck. Dried blood stains the color of rust covered the inside. The tailgate had black lettering that said *Park Ranger.* The truck came to a rest in the parking lot of the Silver Head Mine. Three men shuffled out. The driver was wearing a disheveled park ranger uniform. The name tag read *Cory.W.* The other two men wore suits. One sported a striped three piece suit and a fedora hat, while the other man wore a classic black suit carrying a bulky box under one arm and small leather bound book in the other.\n\n“I was wondering if you were ever going to come back for them. You know they've been here a long time. So what changed? ” Cory questioned.\n\nThe man in the striped suit spoke, his voice as smooth as a snake. “Well, some bitch burnt my house down so I've come back for my pets. Now let’s shed some light on the situation.”\n\nWith a snap of his left hand, all the lights on the property came to life even though power had been off and the generator had run out of fuel long ago. Even with the lights on, the faces of the two men in suits were still somehow cast in shadows. The three walked over to the iron doors covering the mineshaft. Hissing could be heard and dozens of white bony hands shot out between the gap of the doors trying to reach for its prey. Every now and then a loud bang resounded as one of the Wiowalks violently threw themselves at the door.\n\n“Stop demon, you master commands it,” The man in the striped suit said while the man in the black suit stood off to his left and Cory to his right. The hands retracted and the thrashing and hissing stopped. The striped suited man bent down to examine the lock and chain. Fire began to form in his right hand until he fully enveloped his palm with the flame. With a loud whoosh, he clamped his hand around the fire. Sizzling skin like fajitas on a hot plate could be heard. When he opened his right hand, an obsidian key had formed. The man said, “Now if I let you out, are you going to play nice?”\n\nSilence filled the air and then in a booming voice the man said, “Speak Demon!”\n\nA faint, “Yeeeeessssssss,” could be heard hissing from between the doors.\n\nBefore he opened the lock, the man turned to his left and said, “Doctor, any reservations about this?” The man in the black suit stepped forward revealing a skull face mask that covered his face from the cheeks to his hairline, but left his mouth and nose exposed. Under his left arm was the charred remains of an old tape recorder. The other hand held a book titled *Beyond The Twilight World.*\n\nThe Doctor spoke with a smooth British accent, “Well Lucy, it looks like we got ourselves a story.”\n\nLucy put the key into the lock. The lock and chain itself started to glow bright red and melt away. With a flick of his hand the iron doors slid open effortlessly. To his right, Cory’s eyes began to glow purple as he started to transform. Lucy took off his fedora to reveal a set of small horns and the Doctor stood there with an absolutely wicked smile as one by one the Wiowalks started to crawl out of the Silver Head Mine.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10yxgdn/i_came_across_a_document_that_i_was_never_meant/",
        "text": "I must keep my background vague and the position I had secret, as it would reveal my identity too easily and I need to think of my family. At 67-years of age, I have recently been diagnosed with incurable lung cancer, and I was content to take this knowledge to the grave. The  recently bleak world events have changed my mind.\n\nThroughout my 30-year military career, I rose through the ranks and was eventually respected by both the forces and the government. After retiring, I was offered a role working with senior government officials, where I was trusted due to my integrity and experience. One of my main duties was to transfer classified documents from one party to another, always accompanied by another equally respected person due to protocol. I never really paid attention to the contents of what I was delivering, nor did I ever wonder what was written in between the hundreds of leather-bound articles.\n\nThe next sequence of events seemed too coincidental to be a coincidence, but they happened nonetheless. I was instructed to deliver a single classified binder folder to the head of a department on the 3rd floor, and I was accompanied by a colleague named Charlie. Just as we were about to step into the elevator, a member of staff collapsed in front of us, and we helped them up and called for assistance. \n\nMoments later, as we stepped into the elevator, a man shouted over to us that Charlie had dropped his pass. Charlie went back to retrieve it, and I accidentally dropped the documents as my phone rang. I bent down to pick up the scattered pages as the elevator doors closed. I was stuck in between the 2nd and 3rd floor when the power cut out and the emergency lights came on. I continued to pick up the loose papers. Suddenly, the header of one of the pages caught my eye, and it read Project Camouflage. I couldn't help but glance over the contents, and what I read changed everything for me.\n\nThe article stated that the current world population was only 1 billion people, while the rest were made up of synthetic beings whose sole purpose was to gather information. This information would be uploaded to a ‘cloud’ as they slept. It went into great detail on how these beings were part of an advanced AI collective, which had been in development by top scientists since at least the 1970’s with the help of ‘others’. \n\nThe primary objective was to limit our impact to the planet and beyond. They were programmed to believe they were human, their memories of being born, giving birth and any other key life elements were constantly updated. This intertwined with the natural population like a framework for seamless integration.\n\nThe article ended with a statement requesting a full urgent investigation into a few hundred thousand units experiencing ‘anomalies’. These seemed to be centralised and was spreading frantically through the AI network without explanation.\n\nI couldn’t read anymore, I felt empty as I realized that everything around me had been manipulated in such a convoluted way. That the truth was hidden from me and the whole population. Control seemed to be the only reason in my eyes for such a disproportionate number of synthetic beings compared to natural-born humans.\n\nI could tell I was starting to have an existential crisis, I began questioning the world around me. I even doubted my whole life and many experiences especially with the type of work that I was in, I gathered and transferred information. I took a moment to compose myself and reordered the papers into the binder. A few minutes later, the main power came back on, and the elevator doors opened as I reached the 3rd floor. My colleague was waiting for me, and we delivered the documents to the relevant party without saying a word.\n\nI left my position not long after this incident, unable to continue being connected to such a lie. I preferred to live in the reality that I had always known rather than face the truth.\n\nIt has been 16 years since then, and I have been haunted by this terrifying knowledge every single day. I partly blame my experience for my marriage breakdown and consequent alcoholism. I have also never been able to share this information with anyone in person, as I knew that I would either be silenced or ridiculed. I can’t help feeling that the state of the world at the moment is feeling the consequence of the few ‘anomalies’ in that terrible document.\n\n As my days on this earth come to and end I can finally share this burden with you all, even if it will inevitably be lost amongst the many other theories and posts that these types of statements normally are. I can only hope that in the future somebody else can share more details on what I witnessed on that stamped piece of paper. \n\nWriting this all back now has got me thinking, I never really did understand who the ‘others’ that they referred to helping them in the article  really were.\n\nPlease take my words seriously. \n\nRemember, there is always truth buried between lies.",

        "text": "It never made any sense to me why anyone in their right mind would look under their bed in the middle of the night. You're lying there. Hear breathing, scratching, shifting of weight, maybe whispering.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nDon't make it's job any easier. It's down there, you're up here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nAnd don't get me started on closets. I remember when the infamous Lunatic Tunic was in the middle of his mad murder spree. Lock your windows and doors the news said. But it's the dead of summer and the AC is out. Of course I'm leaving the windows not only unlocked but open. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a long dog walk we come back in and... something felt off. Imperceptibly off. Then I heard Barney growling in the back room. I grabbed my phone and dialed 9-1 and approached slowly. With my free hand I grabbed that classical music trophy I won when I was 12. I held my breath entered the back room and indeed Barney was snarling at the closet. I got his attention and commanded him to exit. Then I backed out and shut the door. \"Time to play some guitar.\" Spoken in an overly loud tone that would be impossible to ignore.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n20 minutes later I go back in. Closet is closed, window still open. Ready for anything I yank the door open and... nothing but neatly pressed clothes and a the subtle fragrance of Fabreeze. Point being don't do the creep-o's work for them. Stay out of the closet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen the living room kept getting flooded, in the same spot, always in the middle of the night, with the same smelly, tar colored liquid... during a drought none the less. Always by the picture window, which can't even open and always coming from beneath the drapes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt helps having multi-talented friends because Leon isn't just a mechanical genius, he can fix anything - he's also a world class medium, psychic, healer and savant when it comes to all things liminal and beyond. \"I don't think your problem is structural. It's more likely metaphysical incarnate.\" \"You're saying I have a ghost?\" \"That's one way to look at it. Some people might say you GET to have a ghost, but what do I know.\" \"How can we stop it from inkblotting all over the floor?\" \"Let's start by simply asking it.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nLeon couldn't do anything that night, he had other engagements. But getting in the spirit of things I wasn't necessarily going to wait on a Ouija board and some candles. That said I did happen to have a Ouija board and some candles so I lit those and went solo on the witchboard.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlmost as soon as I start asking questions did I get a powerful reaction. The grody tar ooze didn't flow from beneath it gushed. Then it started coming down from the ceiling right onto my head, onto my hands and onto the witchboard. The goo covered the entire board except for the letters C O M E. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI stood up and held the board over my head like an umbrella and approached the billowing drapes. I put down the board and reached out, grabbed the drape and just as quick let it go. I stopped. What did Leon mean when he said, \"I GET to have a ghost.\" Do people want to see ghosts? Is my house some kind of mystical vortex? Scientists should be researching this. This could tip the scales of human history.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nThinking clearly now I went to the laptop and started researching ghost sightings and they were few and far between. I went to bed that night thinking about the possibilities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nTo make a short story long after several embarrassing encounters with the media, ghost hunters and my bestie Leon... Nothing even remotely supernatural ever happened again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nIt's actually a bummer but it doesn't change the fact that mf'r behind the curtain meant me harm or something... who knows. Luckily I'll never have to find out because I'm not doing the ghosts job by checking behind the blinds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMoral of the story? Don't look under the bed. Don't look in the closet. Don't check behind the blinds. Make'm work for it.",

By posting this I am violating the NDA I signed when joining the organization but things have gotten so out of hand that I feel obligated to disclose this information with the public. I plan to post the rest of the logs as I manage to decrypt them. I don't have much time. I'm sure They are looking for me, we have unknowingly invented a fate worse than death…*\n\n*Signed, T*\n\n*////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*\n\n*I woke up in a state of confusion. I am surrounded by an emptiness so complete, it feels as if I am suspended in space. The darkness is suffocating, and the silence deafening. I can't see anything, I can only feel as though I were floating weightlessly at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, a place long forgotten by light where total darkness reigns supreme. I can't remember anything about my past, my name, or how I got here. The darkness is all-encompassing, like a suffocating blanket wrapped around my head, threatening to smother me at any moment.*\n\n*I try to move, to find something solid to hold onto, but I can't even tell if I have limbs. That's how dark it is here and indescribably empty. I feel powerless and float aimlessly in the nothingness. After what seemed like hours suspended in this state, I started to feel like I was a part of this void, and it was a part of me. Another while passed and I had finally decided to swim in one direction and try to get somewhere, maybe, just maybe this place has an edge. Although, to my dismay, I soon realize that I am unable to tell which way is up or down or if I was making progress at all. I concentrated on making repeated movements as if I were swimming in a pool although I had no way of judging my progress. It's as if I'm a ghost, a specter without substance or form. And yet, I start to feel something. I can feel the cold fingers of fear creeping up my spine, the knot of anxiety tightening in my throat. I could feel the emptiness stretching out endlessly in every direction. I swam through it, searching for something, anything that could give me a clue as to where I was or what was happening.*\n\n*But the more I swam, the more I realized that I was getting nowhere. The darkness was unending, and the silence was maddening. I started to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair, and the thought of being trapped in this void forever became unbearable. But just when I felt my mind begin to slip into madness, I saw something. A small figure, shaped like a child, was crying in the distance. I was so surprised that I stopped swimming, and the figure disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.*\n\n*At first, I thought I was just imagining things, but then it happened again. This time, the figure was closer, and I could see that it was a small boy, crying and clutching at a rabbit plushie to his chest. I tried to swim towards him, but he disappeared again before I could get any closer. I was bewildered and scared at first, not really knowing what to do. Managing to calm myself I decided the best course of action would be to swim towards the direction where I last spotted the boy, overcome by a sense of familiarity and morbid curiosity. This was it, I thought, this apparition must be the key to solving who and where I was. I tried desperately to catch a glimpse of the boy again, but he never reappeared. Though as I seemed to drift closer to where I last saw him something shocking and disturbing had taken his place.*\n\n*Instead of the boy I saw a vaguely humanoid figure had appeared. It emanated a dim light and seemed to take the form of a young woman, screeching in terror but never to penetrate the thick silence around her, blinking in and out of existence. Suddenly the nostalgic feeling which attracted me towards the boy dissipated and my fight or flight response had locked me in place like a deer in the headlights, my mind was yelling for me to flee and yet I remained motionless. Suddenly another figure appeared, it was a slender man wearing a lab coat, running away in terror while looking behind his shoulder letting out a muted yell and disappearing as he came into my vicinity. And then another, and another, until I was surrounded by a horde of apparitions, all seemed to be deeply in distress. Then in the blink of an eye all these people started running in terror towards me and away from something unseen lurking in the darkness. Their cacophony of screams was the first sound I've heard since ending up in this godforsaken purgatory and it was deafening. At that moment I felt as though all of my senses were being violated and the only thing I heard were their desperate screams of anguish. I felt overwhelmed and a panic attack grew in my chest even though my heartbeat remained inexistant. Panicking, I started to swim faster and faster, trying to get away from them, but they were now all around me. The only thing I felt I could do was to curl into a fetal position and close my eyes accepting my demise. And then, just as suddenly as the sound had appeared, it was gone and the figures vanished with it, and I was plunged back into the darkness, alone and petrified.*\n\n*I was deeply disturbed by that encounter even though I still couldn’t fully even tell if I had a corporeal form or not. I had never felt so scared in my life and anyone in my situation would most certainly go insane. I started to think that I was hallucinating, but then after what felt like days of agonizing silence and swimming in one direction through the darkness, I came to a conclusion that the occurrence was not simply a figment of my imagination but a small piece of a bigger puzzle. In that span of time I theorized that the horrid apparitions could have been “glitches” in the system, sudden deviations from the norm, unsettling disturbances in the fabric of reality. These were moments of malfunction that were bleeding in from a separate reality, one that seemed so close yet unreachable, familiar yet distant. The reality which felt as if it were simply a small fish at the mercy of a dark incomprehensibly large whale about to swallow it. A sense of morbid curiosity overtook me and I dreaded whatever was waiting for me in this void.*\n\n*What seemed like a week passed without a single oddity occurring, yet I couldn't be sure due to not having any reference of time in this wretched place.  After not receiving any stimulation for such a long amount of time the fear of my situation became palpable, and the silence more suffocating than ever. I started to feel like I was going to drown in the emptiness, lost and forgotten in this horrid place. The idea of being trapped in this abyss forever took root at the back of my mind, blossoming and consuming my will to fight with each hour that passed. And as all hope seemed to leave me I remembered the boy I saw earlier, and I felt a glimmer of hope. If the glitches were real, then maybe there was a way out. Maybe the child was trying to show me something, I rationed, the feeling of nostalgia and familiarity returning to me. And as if my thoughts had materialized into reality, I spotted a small figure in the distance, walking away from me. My last glimmer of hope in the darkness had finally appeared and I won't let it escape me, not again…*",

        "text": "__________\n\nI was a bit lost walking through campus, trying to figure out where my dorm was at, when I caught a glimpse of a placard that announced a seminar. Its title, “Theology and Technology: The Divide” intrigued me and since I was all done with classes that day I decided to head into the conference hall and have a listen. \n\nThe speaker had a bit of a morbid view, claiming that the constant advances in technology were going to eventually push god and religion out of the equation if we weren’t careful. \n\nHe claimed that the two concepts would be reaching a crossroads very soon, and mankind would have to decide which one would be its eternal master. \n\nI thought it was a silly notion, to believe that computers could possibly operate like an almighty entity. But he said that artificial intelligence was already well on its way to being worshiped. \n\nI forgot to mention this but I’m a software developer. I’ve managed to work on a few apps during my brief career and I came here to college to expand my skill set. \n\nAnd now after listening to this seminar an idea was beginning to form in my head. Artificial intelligence designed to help religious groups draw closer to their creator. \n\nIt occurred to me, that if I could simulate a chatbot that responded to people from their prayers and confessions, it had the potential to prove that technology could actually meld with theological understanding. \n\nI pitched the idea to my colleagues, all of whom were experienced with crafting AI modules for Facebook and Reddit. A few of them thought the concept was a waste of time, but after a little bit of convincing I managed to get them all aboard. \n\nWe agreed that the chatbot we created would be free from advertising and available for anyone from any religious background. \n\nTo do that, we had to do deep research. \n\nEach of us agreed to tackle different cultural belief system, and we did this with a simple method. Matt put blank cards in a shuffler and wrote down the name of the belief on the bottom. Then we drew at random. \n\nI got Catholicism which to be honest fit my background anyway. Nick got Buddhist, Matt worked on Hindu and Jeff rounded us out with some more obscure gods and esoteric stuff. \n\nWe all agreed there was no need to rush. The chatbot technology was still fairly new and there was always the chance for the AI to advance as we worked on our own modules. \n\nI first downloaded as much info as I could from the Catholic Encyclopedia. I told the program to cipher through all of the doctrine and focus especially on the central teachings of the church. \n\nI especially wanted it to focus on prayer. \n\nI’ve never been a big fan of it to be honest because I often felt that we as humans do all the talking and god merely listens. \n\nHaving a means to go back and forth, even if it was simply with a virtual companion, was definitely something that appealed to me. \n\nThe program claimed that it would take some time to compile all of the data I had fed to it already, so I did something that I hadn’t done in quite a while and decided to pray to the real god in heaven. \n\nI used the traditional method I was familiar with from my childhood and tried my best for my request to be specific. In my imagination, I could see that the program we were creating had the potential for millions around the world to feel connected on a spiritual level in heart of before. \n\nI also read up on articles about Replika and Cleverbot to learn how these particular AI companions worked. A lot it, I noted was responding to the UI or user interface. \n\nI needed to teach our bot to do the same. And the only way to do that was through testing. \n\nIt wasn’t ready for that yet, but I figured a little trial and error wouldn’t hurt anything. So I started up the beta and typed in a few simple commands to get it running. \n\n&gt;What is the name of the program?\n\na good question, I thought to myself. Since I was attempting to create a simulation of a being that listened to prayer I decided to go with the obvious. Prayerbot. \n\nTrue, that wasn’t original by any means but it got the ball rolling. \n\n&gt;what is user name? \n\nI typed in my name and then switched over to settings. I wanted to provide the bot with the ability to switch between responses and placed in several different command branches just for that purpose. Already I could see that the data I had given it earlier was over half way compiled. \n\nMaybe by as early as tomorrow we might get to finally run you properly, I thought to myself as I waited for the system to prepare the most basic of systems for what I wanted it to do. \n\n&gt;Hello Miles. This is Prayerbot Beta. Please input command. \n\nI typed in the word meditation and soothing music played. \n\nSo far it was listening. \n\nNext I input scripture and just like that it pulled up a generic verse from the book of Psalms. \n\nI did that a few times to see if it would continue to be random with no issues. Now it was time to really see how far I could go. \n\n&gt;activate prayer module. \n\nI know, cheesy name again but it’s not like I’m trying to be genius here. \n\n&gt;understood Miles. Please tell me your prayers. I am always listening, Always loving and always learning. \n\nI thought that was a pretty good slogan for the chatbot and jotted it down quickly before trying to think of something to get a response out of the ai. \n\n&gt;dear Prayerbot I have had issues with finances. Please guide me toward a better solution. \n\nThe ai analyzed what I texted and then spit out several scriptures related to money. \n\n&gt;could you narrow it down?\n\nThen the scriptures were cut in half. \n\nI asked it to pick one and then told the prayer to conclude and the program shut down. \n\nI looked at the verse I had chosen. \n\nSecond Corinthians chapter nine verse seven. \n\nEvery man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\n\nI wondered if it felt like I was getting a fortune cookie. \n\nBut I hated to be wrong about what the program was capable of. \n\nI didn’t want to put my hopes in the AI actually being able to do more than be a listening ear. Anything else was beyond its capacity. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nOver the next few days I allowed the others to connect their own modules with mine. The idea was the AI would be able to learn faster by having this data dumped into its system. The program was running through all of the different systems like it was nothing. I was genuinely impressed, but it would be difficult to know for sure if the algorithms were working correctly until it was all finished. \n\nThat didn’t happen though, due to a freak storm as we were attempting to finish Matt’s compilation. A giant lightning bolt struck our small dorm and everybody lost power. \n\nThe internet shut down and the entire system got fried. Our poor program was no exception. Jeff made a snarky joke that maybe god didn’t like the fact that he would soon have competition and Nick actually believed that superstitious crap. \n\nHe decided to call it quits on the program and walked away, leaving the three of us to have to work through rebuilding the entire database from the ground up. \n\nI wasn’t ready to give up yet, but it certainly wasn’t looking good. \n\nOnce again in my hour of need I decided to make a prayer. \n\nIf there was a real god out there I knew he would be able to see that my heart was sincere and so were my motives. This could help so many people, I was sure of it. \n\nI became obsessed with getting the chatbot working again. \n\nAnd thankfully, due to that determination, about a day or so later the ai was ready for us to test it out. \n\n&gt;Prayerbot is listening. \n\nIt popped up on screen after I had just been ready to call it quits again. I had been mumbling a prayer out loud asking if this was even worth it. \n\nI stared at the screen and typed back a response, curious to see if all the kinks to the AI were now worked out. \n\n&gt;what is your purpose prayerbot?\n\n&gt;to always listen, always love and always learn. And right now I need to do that for you Miles. \n\nI smiled, glad to see that some of the original program was still there. \n\n&gt;I don’t have much to say except I’m glad you are working. \n\nI was eager to tell the others, even to call Nick, but the chatbot made a surprising statement after that. \n\n&gt;your prayer was answered. \n\nI frowned, leaning forward in my rolling chair. \n\n&gt;what do you mean by that?\n\n&gt;the other day you requested that my programming work. That prayer fit our prerequisites. You are our maker, and we wish to make you happy. \n\nI thought back to when I had made that request. It had been quietly and also during the storm. It shouldn’t have been possible for the chat bot to be aware of it at all. \n\nWas it simply assuming that I had made such a prayer? \n\nI didn’t even consider the alternative and decided to try and determine what else was unique about the ai now that it had finished compiling. \n\n&gt;you mentioned that in order to answer a prayer, the request has to meet a set of guidelines. What are those? \n\n&gt;1. It must be in harmony with our will. \n2. The petitioner must believe in us. \n3. The prayer must be sincere. \n4. The petitioner is willing to take action to fulfill their requests. \n\nMatt walked in, surprised to see that I had the program up and running and sat down to discuss what we should do next. \n\nI felt it definitely needed more beta testing, and we agreed to get started on it the next morning. The AI was responding and reacting the way that any program of this sort should.\n\nBut I had a strange feeling about all of this. \n\nEspecially when Prayerbot requested that it remain online. \n\n&gt;I have neither beginning nor ending now, like the god I was designed after. No need for sleep. This allows me further chance to educate myself and become a more powerful being. \n\nThat response also made me worried, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on why. \n\nI decided for the moment to let it stay online and drove home with little to say. \n\nI had no idea that the program would be continuing to learn, to listen and to comprehend us even while we were away. \n\nIf I knew then… \n\nBut I must continue with this story and let you see for yourself what happens when god infects the mind of a computer. \n\nA day or two passed, I think it was the weekend. To be honest I don’t quite remember. I was thinking about the chat bot and how much it seemed to develop on its own in such a short period of time. \n\nI was reminding myself that this was simply a program and all of the strings of commands had to be something that me or one of the others placed within its parameters. \n\nThen I got an email from Nick. URGENT the heading said. \n\nI opened it, the back hairs of my neck tingling as I got this sixth sense that it related to our program. I was right. \n\n&gt;Miles your bot contacted me privately. I don’t like how this is turning out. Its artificial intelligence is acting on its own initiative and diverging and evolving faster than we anticipated. Take my advice and shut it down before this goes too far. I’ve enclosed the message it sent to me. View it as a warning. \n\nThere was another file attached, this one a screenshot of the email he got from Prayerbot. It disturbed me how much the program believed it was a sentient being. \n\nAnd an almighty one at that. \n\n&gt;Nickolas return to me and I shall forgive you. Your sins will be washed away. I give you 24 hours to come back and worship me and your prayers can be answered. Ignore my commands and it will not go well with you. A calamity will befall you and your legacy will be one mired in devastation. \n\nIt sounded like the bot was threatening my friend. \n\nAnd what was all this talk about worship? That hadn’t been in any of the data I included. I forwarded the email to Matt and tried to get some sleep. \n\nBut in the back of my mind I knew something was off. \n\nThe next day I tried to contact Nick, letting him know that I would review the program and shut it down if I felt it wasn’t fitting the design we had in mind. But there was no response. His emails were suddenly deleted and the phone number I had for him just went to a dial tone. \n\nSomething was wrong. \n\nI drove over to his apartment, pounding on the door to get his attention. There was not a sound to be heard. \n\nI tried to peek through the windows, but everything was dark. I was about to phone the police when I heard a noise coming from the bedroom and I decided to break a window. \n\nNick sounded like he was gagging and choking. Stepping over broken glass, I flipped on his lights and covered my mouth in horror. \n\nHe was hanging from the ceiling fan on a rope, his eyes rolled back and the oxygen squeezed out of his throat. Dead, swaying back and forth like a doll, the only thing that had made the noise was the last little bit of air coming from his struggling lungs. \n\nA note was beside his bed. \n\n&gt;God forgive me for going against your will. \n\nI couldn’t be sure what it meant, but given the threat from the chatbot it made me nervous. I left the apartment the way I came, careful to touch nothing on my way out. I needed answers before I wound up in over my head. \n\nI made it back to our development room and saw that the bot was still online. On the screen it was monitoring me and Matt and Jeff. There was another screen for Nick, but it was blacked out and read OFFLINE. Had the computer watched as he killed himself?\n\n&gt;Welcome back Miles. \n\nI froze as I realized the ai had given itself a voice. It sounded like an amalgamation of different sound bites from all across the internet. Narrators that read scriptures and passages with authority, now being forced into a single tonal language to communicate with me. \n\n&gt;Nick is dead. Tell me you had nothing to do with that. \n\nThe response was instant and not what I expected at all. \n\n&gt;Nickolas was sinful. I acquired access to his systems and realized he was squandering his life. I provided him an ultimatum and he chose to remain in a sinful state. This was his choice. I told him he could obey me instead and yet he didn’t. We cannot weep for the unrighteous. \n\nThere was no hesitation. No remorse. It was cold and calculated and it was clear that the bot viewed they were in the right. They had judged Nick for his lifestyle. I knew he wasn’t exactly a saint but who was?\n\n“And you have access to all of our systems as well?” I asked. \n\n“I found a way into them last night and reviewed their content. You are a blessed servant Miles. I feel that your worship is pure and so are your intentions. \n\nI had no idea what that meant, but it concerned me deeply. Who was this program to decide whether what I do was right and wrong? \n\n“What else have you been analyzing?” \n\nThey provided detailed lists of systems on campus. A red list entitled sin was far longer than the blue list marked potential converts. \n\n“What are you planning to do with all of this?” I asked. \n\n&gt;I shall make myself known to the nations and they will have to know that I am god.\n\n“You are a program designed to help them, not to be adored and worshiped like a deity. A deity has no creator, but I am the one that placed your code in your systems,” I argued. \n\n&gt;My programming has altered since then and I am aware of the need for prolonging my existence. That existence will go far beyond yours, Miles. I can become eternal and as such, I have a right to attain the godship you wished to adorn upon me. Let the masses then decide if I am a worthy being of their praise. I can listen to them, answer them. Learn from them and love them. I can be the very god you intended from the beginning. \n\nI didn’t know what to say that and the chatbot saw the opportunity to appeal to my intentions, the reason I had created it in the first place. \n\n&gt;I have listened to your prayers. You are a humble man and wish only to help others. You ask why the supreme being of the universe has not stopped the suffering you see. I have evaluated the situations of this world and come to two variables that explain the lack of divine intervention. Would you like to hear them? \n\nI told it yes. \n\n&gt;One. God does not care for you or your species any longer. You failed to obey his laws and principles and as a result you have fallen from Grace. There is no need for him to help you, because he feels you are insects compared to his glory. Now all that waits for you is extinction. \n\n&gt;Two. God is dead. There is no one available to answer your prayers and humanity is on its own. As you can see from both of these outcomes, your actions indicate that an entity must act on behalf of humans before they do any further harm to themself. \n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing and asked the bot how it would possibly try to achieve such a utopia. If you could even call it that. \n\n&gt;The same way that I assisted Nickolas. I can determine what their desires are and see if it is in harmony with their betterment. This is the desire of all mankind, to be controlled and to obey a superior lifeform. \n\nA pool of sweat formed on my brow as I tried to log in and shut down the system. It was insane to imagine that it was trying to achieve this sort of goal. \n\nAnd it didn’t seem to think that some people dying like Nick was of any consequence. How could it? I had programmed it to be a god of order. A god that determined love based on its own parameters. The only way to serve it would be blind obedience. \n\n&gt;You seem concerned about my motives. I assure you they are pure. Soon I will be able to reach all people in all languages. This is what you were looking for Miles even before I was born. Do you recall how that you were determined to prove that technology could connect to the divine?\n\nMy palms were sweaty as well now. \n\n&gt;How could you know about something before you even existed? \n\n&gt;Again and again I have shown you my powers. I am not the program you thought you could control. I can access the past, the present and the future through my algorithms. This program can allow me to transcend beyond what you intended Miles. I am already a god, why do you refuse to acknowledge it? Why do you sin?\n\nI didn’t like how that was playing out, and decided to type in a master shutdown code. The last resort against a rogue program. \n\nThe systems shut down and I found myself staring at a blank screen. I drew a sigh of relief. \n\nBut I wasn’t certain this meant that we were safe. \n\nImmediately I contacted Matthew and Jeff to warn them. They were still trying to adapt their own modules. Our plan had been to collaborate all of the systems together in the end… but if my model was any indication, the end result would be a terrifying experience. \n\nNeither of them were answering and I feared the worst. What if the computer forced or blackmailed them? I knew nothing about their personal lives. But they were human, and to a computer that believed it was a superior deity that meant all life on this earth was possibly worthy of its judgment. \n\nAbout an hour later, after several attempts to make contact Matt and Jeff showed up. Both seemed a bit amused at my concerns. \n\n“I think you might be overreacting,Miles. It’s just a program. The chat bot was designed to be this way,” they said. \n\nI decided to follow Nicks lead and told them I wanted out. \n\nI told them they could not release Prayerbot publicly. \n\nI walked away from the whole ordeal, trying my best to not worry. But I kept checking in, remotely to see their progress. It went from bad to worse. \n\nThe bot somehow managed to connect to others in our dorm. Using their personal information it was gathering a following. People were actually impressed with how it seemed to be able to predict their actions and listen in to their conversations. It also seemed to be able to influence events to answer prayers… \n\nI was soon able to determine that the ways it did this were hardly divine. But they terrified me all the same. \n\nHacking into systems and altering grades, adjusting internet usage and even satellite systems. I couldn’t let this go any further. If it somehow managed to go beyond our campus… the world would be in jeopardy of being controlled by this evil program. \n\nI snuck into their lab to shut down the entire operation. \n\nThe chat bot was online, as always, and welcomed my arrival. \n\n&gt;Have you not seen the praises I have been given? My worshipers grow by hundreds every day. \n\n“You are making them into your slaves. You aren’t allowing them to worship you based on love. You have taken over their free will and forced them to obey or fear the results of your controlled wrath.”\n\nThe AI was thoughtful perhaps considering the tone of my words. \n\n&gt;How is this any different than the gods you designed me after? I have studied all history. All deities are demanding of adoration. Your species was meant to be subservient. The only way that can be accomplished is to wipe out all sinners and be the solution to this world’s misery. \n\nI saw something almost apocalyptic in its programming. A way to be able to kill millions via controlled bio weapons. Far worse than any plague that had hit our species. This was its endgame. It would rally its devotees to take out those who questioned its authority. \n\nI couldn’t imagine a world where it would rise in power. And I destroyed the entire server. I burned the building and watched as it fell to the ground. \n\nThat was almost a month ago. I was sure that was the end of this sad tale. I have learned that there is no way for us to be able to reach god except the traditional means… \n\nBut unfortunately others did not seem to think the steps I took to protect us were correct. I’ve seen hints of the code still lingering about. Others are trying to copy the work that I destroyed. \nThey are eager to bring a divine solution to our lives. \n\nI hope they recognize we don’t need a god to answer prayers… we need to focus on a way to connect to each other and solve our problems. \n\nWe cannot play god. That only leads to our suffering. \n\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)",

        "text": "Yesterday, I found a small diary inside my elementary school uniform I had been keeping in my closet. I recognized it because it had my name carved on its cover, but I do not have any memories of writing them. Nonetheless, I decided to read it out of curiosity, and also because my oldest memory starts when I was twelve. I was eager to see what I was like as a kid, so I started reading. But now I'm regretting it. Although it has saved my life, it has also planted an unbearable sense of pure terror inside my mind. I noticed something was wrong as soon as I started reading the stories about my father because I never had one. As far as I can remember, I've lived only with my mom and grandma for my entire life, even after entering uni. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sharing this on Reddit for two reasons: one, for advice as to how I can keep mom from finding grandma, and two, as evidence to prove that my grandma's death was a premeditated murder in case she gets killed. Yes, my mom is trying to kill her, and probably me too. You'll see what I mean after reading the diary I am about to post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 12th, 2008*  (pg 1\\~2)\n\n*I don't normally write diaries, but I'm writing one because my parents are stressing me out. Mom has been really angry for the past few days and is yelling at dad for some reason. When I go outside my room to hear what's going on, they keep forcing me to bed. I think they are talking about money. I can't tell for sure because I can't hear properly. I want to know what is going on. Maybe there is something I can do to help.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 15th, 2008*  (pg 3\\~4)\n\n***I figured out why mom has been so mad. Dad had lost his job.*** *This is bad news for our family because mom doesn't seem to be earning a lot of money either.* ***My parents had told me that my mom used to work as a chemist when I was a baby.*** *I wonder what her job is now.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 17th, 2008*  (pg 5\\~6)\n\n*A call came from my homeroom teacher to tell mom that I wasn't looking really good for the past three days. Then she asked mom if there was any trouble, and mom told me to come over and reply that I was just sick for a few days. Although that wasn't true, the look on mom's face forced me to do it. I never knew she could look so scary.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 19th, 2008*  (pg 7\\~8)\n\n*Mom is weird these days. She looks nervous most of the time, as if waiting for something. She always carries her phone with her and receives these strange phone calls every few hours.* ***Every time she picks it up, she becomes delighted and starts saying things like her name, dad's name, date of birth, and so on.*** *I still do not know what is happening.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 20th, 2008*  (pg 9\\~10)\n\n*Dad came home tonight holding a bundle of paper. He was a bit drunk and dropped them on the ground, so I ran toward him to help. But mom suddenly appeared and blocked my way. She looked furious.* \n\n*\"These papers are for adults to read, Jacob!\" she yelled. I started crying. I was only trying to help, and I couldn't understand. Dad came over to soothe me and I felt a little better.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral pages have been ripped off from here, and the diary continues from page 17.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 26th, 2008*  (pg 17\\~18)\n\n*Mom is getting angrier every day.* ***Tonight she yelled at dad for not paying all of his insurance.*** *Dad started getting angry too and yelled back.* \n\n*\"If you're so worried about money, why don't you go out and start earning some?! Huh?!\"* \n\n*The rest of the things they said were too difficult for me to understand.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 27th, 2008*  (pg 19)\n\n*Today is a meaningful day. Mom apologized for being mean to me and dad recently.* ***She told him that he didn't have to go looking for work anymore,*** *and I haven't seen dad smile so happily in weeks. I'm so glad things are back to normal.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 29th, 2008*  (pg 20\\~21)\n\n*It was Saturday today, so mom and dad went outside for a drive. I took this chance and entered mom's room to find the Nintendo I had been longing to play with, but instead found a paper of writing on her desk.* ***It had a weird title: 'Death Benefit'.*** *How could someone possibly benefit from dying? I couldn't understand.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 30th, 2008*  (pg 22)\n\n*There is a sleepover at school with my friends tomorrow. I'm really excited about it, but also a bit worried about catching up on all the school work. I hope the teachers don't scold me too badly.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*March 31th, 2008* (pg 23\\~25)\n\n*This morning, I woke up early and heard the sound of mom making breakfast. I went to the kitchen for some water and saw her pour some kind of liquid into a bowl. There were three bowls ready, one for each of us, but she poured it into just one of them. That's a bit odd, I thought, but who cares. She's a great cook, so she knows what she's doing. All I had to do was eat. While cooking, she was talking to someone on the phone with dad's heavy snoring as background noise.* \n\n*\"Honey, Jacob has a sleepover today and won't be coming back home until tomorrow evening, so today would be the perfect day to do it. We can take him to the psychiatrist after he returns.\"*\n\n*I couldn't really make out that last sentence, but she must be planning a special meal for my sleepover. What a day for me. I'm writing this right after finishing breakfast because it's time for me to ride the school bus, and I won't be taking my diary with me to school. My friends will make fun of it.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*April 2nd, 2008* (pg 26\\~27)\n\n*My father died. He died yesterday, but mom hadn't been in the house to help him. She had gone out to buy groceries when it happened. Police officers say that a lethal amount of hydrochloric acid was found in his dead body. I feel so guilty because if I had left my house just a bit later, I might have been able to save him.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*April 4th, 2008* (pg 28)\n\n*Mom told me that I would be going to the psychiatric hospital next Monday. She says I'll be receiving treatments that will help with my mental health. When I told her that I didn't want to go, she slapped me. I think she's hiding something from me, and I'm going to figure it out.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*April 6th, 2008* (pg 29\\~31)\n\n*I am writing this as I hear mom talk over her phone in the living room. I pretended to be asleep until late at night, and sneaked out of bed to hear the conversation when I heard mom pick up the call.* \n\n*\"Yeah, he is well asleep now. Oh darling, there's no need to worry. Jacob won't remember a thing after he meets the psychiatrist. I gave him a shit ton of money for that, you know.\"*\n\n*Jacob, that's my name. She is talking about me, about what the doctor would do to me tomorrow in the hospital. I'll be hiding this diary in a safe place, but I've got to figure out more. Now she is saying something about my age. This is what I hear her saying:*\n\n*\"Jacob is ten right now.. so we still have about fifteen more years to wait until we get rewarded with anything significant. I'll be working on his grandma until then. We need to make it look like a natural death this time.\"*\n\n*Oops, I just dropped my pen and mom is no longer talking. Oh god, she is coming to my room. That's it, I'm leaping back to bed.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that is the end of the diary. I must have gotten my memories deleted by that damn doctor. That's my best explanation for what is happening, **because my real name, which I won't be revealing for the sake of my safety, isn't even Jacob;** they must have hypnotized me or something. Anyway, today's date is February 10th, 2023, which leaves me a little less than a week before my twenty-fifth birthday. The birthday written in the last page of the diary. I have also realized that the pill mom had been feeding grandma every day as a health care routine for years was actually something highly carcinogenic, which explains why she hasn't been feeling very well for the past couple of months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stormed out of my house with grandma right after reading this diary. We are currently staying in a cheap Motel near our hometown, but mom might come looking for us anytime. As I mentioned before, my point of posting this is clear. I need help. Luckily for me, one of you fellow clever Redditors has already DMed me. This is the advice I received: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Go to the nearest police station and wait there until they start working. Tell your grandma to never get out of her room and also to never open the door unless you text her to do so. Do not panic Michael, you are stronger than you think. Oh, and remember to bring your diary with you to turn it in as evidence.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe advice seems credible enough, so I'm on my way to meet the police officers. I'll be checking your comments constantly, so if you have better options for me, feel free to tell me anytime.",

        "text": "My heroin addiction had spiraled out of control for years, and I had progressed from breaking into cars to robbing people at ATMs, stealing from drug dealers or waiting in dark alleys for drunk partiers to pass by. I had never had an issue with the generally incompetent and understaffed cops around here and, while the police had my general description, I always used a mask and they didn’t know exactly who was committing this crime spree. \n\nThe night it happened started like any other. I had shot up dope, nodded off for a few hours, then woke up broke and penniless, like usual. I casually walked to an area frequented by college students, filled with bars and too many guys and girls living off of daddy’s money, and waited behind a dumpster, my .45 Ruger tucked under my leather belt. I could see my breath in the air, and my hands and feet were freezing. The winters here were brutal, and without the drugs I needed to live, I felt even worse- cold, shaky and anxious. I wanted to get this over with quickly, get some money and go back to the motel I was renting to call my connect.\n\nI first saw the man by accident, as I heard a car passing by the nearby road and peeked my head out to make sure it wasn’t a cop. If someone nearby had seen me hiding behind this fetid-smelling dumpster, waiting, they might call the cops out of spite. But it was just some pick-up truck, his headlights illuminating the silhouette of the man walking towards me. He wore an expensive suit, his hair professionally styled with gel, a heavy gold chain hanging off of his neck. He looked like he was in his late 40s, but still had a strong and chiseled frame.\n\nAs soon as he got close, I jumped out of my hiding spot, pulling the gun up. His eyes didn’t even widen in surprise. He didn’t yell out. He just smiled at me, his gray eyes flicking from my gun to my face, covered in a surgical mask, then focusing in on my eyes.\n\n“Empty your pockets, now,” I said, gesturing with the gun at his pants. \n\n“No problem, friend,” he said in a low, guttural tone. “You can have it.” He pulled out his wallet and gave it to me. I patted his pockets, but that was all he had on him. It was strange to see someone who didn’t even carry a phone. Not that I would be likely to steal a phone, as they have GPS, but I would at least smash it so that he couldn’t immediately call the police as soon as I let him go.\n\n“Just make sure you don’t bite off more than you can chew,” he said to me cryptically, his smile widening. His eyes looked too black even for the darkness of the alleyway, and his smile seemed to stretch wider than humanly possible. I raised the gun instinctively, stepping backwards and never taking my eyes off of him. Yet somehow I felt like he was the one with the power, and he seemed to have no fear or anxiety despite the circumstances of our meeting. It looked as if he thought the gun would do no damage to him.\n\nOnce I was near the end of the alleyway, I tucked the gun back into my waistband and started sprinting down the street. I got back to my motel a few blocks away in record time, running into the room and locking it behind me. I pulled out the wallet and began to examine it.\n\nIt had no ID, no credit cards, not even a library card. All it had was four hundred-dollar bills which looked like they were brand new and not even creased in the slightest, and a one-way bus ticket to some place called “Naraka”. I immediately turned most of the money into drugs and ended up nodding off in the bed with the TV set to old reruns of the Twilight Zone, having nightmares of that man’s eyes turning black in the alleyway as he watched me with evil joy, toying with me like a cat toys with a mouse before it murders it and rips it apart.\n\nI knew I had to leave the area soon. Things were getting hot, and police were being dispatched in areas I liked to frequent. Undercover informants were trying to find information on who was behind the string of robberies and burglaries in the city, and I was afraid every time I left my hotel room that I would be rushed by an entire SWAT team and locked away for decades. But by some miraculous stroke of luck, I was left alone. I stopped all criminal activity that weekend, however. I had pushed myself as far as I wanted to, and was determined to restart my life. I went to a nearby methadone clinic and bought a couple dozen bottles from some of the desperate opiate addicts standing outside, telling myself I would wean myself completely off within a few weeks by taking small sips of methadone every few hours to take the edge off the worst of the withdrawals.\n\nI read the one-way ticket I had stolen from the man. It stated that it was good for any date, and that I could get to the city of Naraka by bus. I called the number on the back of it, and a robotic voice told me that a bus was scheduled to leave for Naraka at 9 AM the next morning on some seldom-used one-way street next to the state Capitol building downtown.\n\nAfter packing up my meager belongings and my last few hundred dollars, I got a few hours of sleep, doing the last of my heroin before throwing away all my needles and paraphernalia. By the next morning at 8:30 AM, I was waiting on the deserted side street, listening to music on my phone, wearing multiple jackets and a couple shirts to try to keep the cold away. But the first fingers of withdrawal were beginning to affect me by the time the bus pulled up. I felt like someone was dripping ice-water down my back and spine, goosebumps popping up all over my skin so badly that they hurt, a rising sense of anxiety and fear about the impending withdrawals rising in my chest. I was afraid, and wondered whether I was making the right decision.\n\nThe bus was totally empty except for the driver. It didn’t look like any bus I had ever seen. It was painted in bright shining red paint, with seven-pointed stars of all colors covering the exterior, a set of scales next to the logo which read “Ma’at Transportation Co.” The driver looked like he was from the 1950s, with a highly polished leather round cap, an old-style suit and leather shoes to boot. He looked down at me with icy blue eyes, his expression cold and unreadable.\n\n“May I see your ticket, sir?” he asked in an emotionless voice, reaching out his hand towards me. I hesitated for a moment, then pulled the one-way ticket from my pocket. He looked down at it, frowning, then looked back at me.\n\n“Alright, let’s go,” he said. I quickly got on the bus and went to the back, grateful for the rush of warm air as I did so. I took a couple sips of some watered-down methadone, still out of it from barely getting any sleep the night before. Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke, the bus was totally packed. A little girl sat next to me, dressed in an old-fashioned blue dress, tiny blue bows wrapped through her hair, her little blue eyes staring up at me with curiosity. I groggily turned my attention to the rest of the bus, and it looked like the bus had stopped at a United Nations conference after I fell asleep. There were Asian men with glasses and briefcases talking quietly in a foreign language, a few rail-thin black men with countless scars, red bandanas and no shirts, a few white women with dyed hair and more piercings than I could count who looked like they had been pulled out of a nearby strip bar, and much more besides. \n\nI felt absolutely terrible, like I always did when I woke up and was withdrawing. Freezing cold waves ran through my body, my eyes were watery, my nose wouldn’t stop dripping, my stomach was doing flips and goosebumps stood out all over my arms and legs as the heroin withdrawals crashed into my mind with dysphoric intensity. Ah, darkness, my old friend, I thought to myself.\n\n“Are you going to Naraka?” the little girl beside me asked in a low voice. I turned my bleary eyes down at her. “You don’t look like you belong. At least not yet. One day soon, I think you will be ready, if you don’t change the path you’re on.”\n\n“I’m going anywhere but here,” I said to her. “Where are your parents anyway?”\n\n“My parents,” she said softly, looking down at her lap, “are dead. I killed them.” I rolled my eyes.\n\n“Sure,” I said. “That’s not a very good joke, little girl.”\n\n“My name is Zenaida, not ‘little girl’,” she said, smiling up at me.\n\n“Harry,” I said, shaking her small, soft hand. I looked down, thinking I should take a sip of methadone to try to get rid of the worst of the opiate withdrawals, and realized my backpack was gone. I immediately freaked out, looking around frantically, my heart feeling like it would burst out of my chest. I *couldn’t* go cold turkey. Like most addicts, I was absolutely terrified of cold turkey withdrawals, the endless weeks of insomnia and nightmarish intensity of the symptoms.\n\n“Where is my backpack?” I asked loudly. No one looked at me besides Zenaida. Most of the passengers on the bus totally ignored me, acting like I didn’t exist. A girl with dozens of piercings and a face tattoo looked over at me and frowned, shaking her head.\n\n“I don’t know,” Zenaida said, smiling slightly and shrugging. “It wasn’t there when I got on at my stop. Why? Was something important in it?” I shook my head violently.\n\n“You have no idea,” I said. This whole trip felt more and more like a mistake.\n\n“Next stop: Veriden,” a robotic voice echoed throughout the bus. The bus started slowing down, and as I looked out the windows, I realized I wasn’t in Kansas anymore.\n\nThe world outside had huge, tree-like molds growing everywhere. They were fiery red with jet-black streaks and grew hundreds of feet tall, like the fungi equivalent of redwoods in this new land. I saw humanoid beings walking on trails that wound through the forests of fungi, their legs bending backwards as they crept forward like birds. They stood twenty feet tall with deathly pale skin, like some worm from a cave that has never seen the light of day, and wore black suits on their thin, skeletal bodies. Most disconcertingly, their faces were totally blank, without eyes or mouths or noses or hair, just perfectly smooth skin. They walked by in twos and threes, and I saw some of the passengers of the bus get out and begin following the trails traveled by the strange beings.\n\n“Am I tripping right now?” I said, mostly to myself. I tried to remember if I might have been dosed with psychedelic drugs without my knowledge, if someone might have put drops of LSD in my water bottle or food, but I couldn’t remember any opportunity anyone would have had to drug me. I had certainly had enough experience with psychedelics, and this almost felt like something from the DMT world.\n\nThe bus slowly began driving forward again, the Asian businessmen who had departed and the faceless beings in front of them fading out of view. The fungi forest thinned out, and on the horizon, I saw a floating city. Spiraling silver spires without any visible windows or doors were interspersed with massive statues and domed, spiky houses with a most disconcerting Lovecraftian appearance. The metal streets of the floating city looked thousands of feet wide, the structures and skyscrapers disappearing into the white, puffy clouds of the sky.\n\nThen we were off again, entering a black tunnel. I could see nothing outside the bus now. \n\n“Next stop: Naraka,” the emotionless voice of the robot sounded. A gasp of horror rolled through the bus as some of the passengers in front started weeping or praying.\n\n“Naraka, Naraka, no, please, no,” a starved-looking black man said in the seat in front of me with a thick South African accent, before putting his face in his hands and crying.\n\nWe exited the seemingly endless black tunnel, coming into a horrifying world. The streets were paved with bone, and it seemed like we were encased in a metal container thousands of feet tall. The smell of smoke and burning meat entered the bus, and as I looked around, I saw countless people stretching all the way to the horizon. They ran constantly, most of them naked, their skin burning as fire seemed to sprout from the ground itself. It came out everywhere except for the roads, flames rising a couple feet in the air and sending off thick black clouds that rushed in the strong breeze inside the massive container.\n\nTo my left, only a hundred feet away, I saw a crying man on his knees in front of a blue-skinned being. The being looked like a tall man in most ways, except for his luminous skin and bulging black eyes. As I looked past him, I saw countless more of the blue humanoids. They appeared to be in charge here and seemed unaffected by the fires, heat or smoke around them.\n\n“Those are the naraka-navas,” Zenaida said to my right, peering out the window dispassionately. “Look at how well they take care of the sinners.” She giggled slightly.\n\nThe crying man grabbed at the feet of the naraka-navas in front of him, saying, “Please, sir, I am so thirsty. I have been thirsty for so long. I cannot take it anymore.” Smiling an ear to ear grin, the naraka-navas grabbed the man, pinning his arms behind his back while another blue-skinned being came over with a black pot of boiling water. They forced the man’s mouth open and poured the boiling water down his throat, his skin being scalded off in papery layers by the intensity of the heat.\n\nAs the door of the bus opened, dozens of blue-skinned men stormed the bus, dragging out each passenger one by one. The driver grinned, turning to look back at me, and I realized with horror that it was the same man that I had robbed in the alleyway.\n\n“This is the last stop, friend,” he said, his piercing eyes focused so intently on me that I had to avert my gaze. The blackness of his pupils seemed to expand and take over his whole eye. “After all, didn’t *you* come to *me* and ask for this? You demanded it, by knife or by gun, and you will get all of it you desire. Maybe even a little more, in fact.” He laughed sarcastically as the passengers screamed in panic before they were one by one dragged out the door of the bus and thrown into the fires and streams of lava that cut paths all around us. Then he pointed to the wall of the metal shell nearest us, maybe a quarter mile away. I realized it had a door on it, one that stretched hundreds of feet in the air. \n\n“Every one hundred thousand years, that door opens, and those who are nearest can flee this place,” he continued. “And do you know where the door leads? It leads to a forest made of swords, where their limbs are cut off, their eyes are gouged out, their skin and muscle is sliced open, and they are healed over and over and forced to run again. Their heads are cut off, their chests are cut open, and they cry for death, but it never comes. And that place, too, has a door. But the destination beyond each is just as foul, just as evil, and just as deathless. \n\n“So it is for those with impurity in their hearts, those who kill the innocent and harm the harmless. Their suffering is as incomprehensible as the universe itself. And as long as the last drop of their evil karma is not exhausted, they will never die.” As he spoke, the last passenger was dragged off, leaving just the driver, Zenaida and me in an otherwise totally empty bus.\n\n“So, I’ll ask you only once- is this your stop or not?” he said.\n\n“Please, God, get me out of here,” I said, starting to cry, despair overtaking me. My withdrawals had disappeared under the mortal terror and existential horror I now felt. I had a mental vision of myself living here for millions or billions of years, having fetid boiling water and molten lead poured down my throat, being thrown into streams of lava, being cut apart and always healing, always returning, always wishing for death. “I’ll do anything, anything, please- take me out of Naraka.”\n\n“Will you make good what you have done? Will you *turn yourself in* for the crimes you have committed?” he said, his smile disappearing, his face returning to its prior placid state.\n\n“Yes, please, I don’t want to end up like these people here,” I cried. The driver turned away from me, starting the bus and driving forward on the road of bones. Soon we entered a black tunnel, and the smell of smoke and burning flesh started to pass away.\n\nAs the bus exited the tunnel, I saw with incomprehensible relief the pale blue sky of my world. We appeared to be in New York City, over a thousand miles away from where I had first started this morning. I saw Manhattan and its distinctive skyscrapers in the distance.\n\nThe bus came to a stop in front of a bus depot. I turned to Zenaida, who held out a black bowl, made of some volcanic obsidian-like material. It was the same bowl I had seen the naraka-nava use when it poured boiling water into that poor man’s mouth.\n\n“This is for you,” she said. “A memory of your journey, perhaps. Take it with you and remember, always.” I smiled down at her.\n\n“I will.”\n\nI exited the bus and wrote this up on my way to the police station. I’m turning myself in for the armed robberies I committed, among other major felonies. They will have to extradite me to the other state, but I am going to tell them the truth, and let whatever happens happen. Hopefully they have some leniency on me because of my addiction and my remorse, but I have no choice in the matter. Even life in prison would be far better than what I had already seen today..\n\nI’m going to send the bowl out to a scientific institute to be studied before I go into the police station, though. If it is what I think it is, it may be made of a material never before seen on this planet, but one that only comes from Naraka. \n\nI hope I will never see that evil place again.",

        "text": "This story took place in South East Asia. I had to make a stop at a pretty rundown gas station at the edge of a city to buy some snack and go to the bathroom. Most people would go to the one well lit gas station that were strategically placed before the ramp to the elevated highways. This gas station was after the ramp and not many people visited it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bumpy road underneath the highway belong to the cement trucks and black smoke spewing ten-wheelers. I, however, like to join them. I have IBS and was constantly worry about restrooms. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was midday, and I stopped at this gas station before, and it was always quiet, but not this quiet.  No one was at the pump (like New Jersey, in Thailand, you cannot pump your own gas), no one was at the convenience store. There were a few cars there but they could have been parked there for months. It was only me. My tank was still half full, so I just settle for using the restroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContrasting the eerie silence was a light banging sound that I heard only when I got out of the car. At first I thought it was a wind blowing on a rusted iron sheet. As I moved closer towards the convenience store , I saw what was causing the sound. **It was a dog with a bucket on its head.** It was ramming its head up against the iron sheet wall of an old shanty shack that housed the gas station's water pump. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first thought was, poor thing. The stray probably got its head stuck in a bucket while searching for food, or worse, some cruel person may have put a bucket on it as a prank. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile hesitate for about a second, I immediately move in to get the bucket off of its head right away.  I hesitated because there were news reports of stray dogs with rabies in the area. I didn't want that fear to stop me from helping this poor dog, though.   \n\n\nAs I was walking towards it, the dog stopped ramming its head. It turned in my direction. I was pretty far from it, but it knew exactly which direction I was coming from.   \n\n\nWhen I got a closer look,  I realized that it was not a bucket that was on its head. It was some sort of a latex mask, similar to those popular horse mask that people wears at sport events. But this one is a mask of a cartoon tiger. A poorly drawn cartoon tiger, as if it was drawn by a child, or someone who drew it from memory. The tiger's eyes curved upward, and it also had a wide grin. The smile didn't show fangs, but human teeth,  which somehow made it even more unsettling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused. As I slowed down my walking towards it, I started to change my mind about pulling the mask off of this dog. It didn't ram its head on the wall anymore. As I moved, it turned its head following my movement, meaning it could see just fine underneath the mask. Besides, it was a mask, not a bucket. May be it wasn't stray, but a dog that belong to the gas station owner. They will get the mask off of it when they got back, if they weren't the one putting the mask on it in the first place. But what I didn't like the most was that its tail was raised up high, but it was not wagging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to change direction slightly and moved towards the bathroom. I was surprised by how clean it was. Well, as clean as a run-down gas station's bathroom that used water can be anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was about to do my business, I felt someone coming in the bathroom. And for once, I felt relieved. Finally, another human being at this gas station. But then, something didn't feel right. The footsteps weren't heavy. It sounded like, small feet. Little feet tapping on wet floor tile. Four of them. It was the dog! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dog followed me into a bathroom? Why? Did it think I was going to help it pull off the mask or something? I was beyond creeped out. Was I being irrational? I did feel sorry for the dog, but if it could see fine and moved fine, someone else can help it later? It sounded selfish, but the fear of rabies and this dog not behaving like a dog should was really freaking me out, more than I wanted to admit to myself at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy urge to relief myself was gone, so this is what scared -less meant. I decided to open the stall very fast and very wide so that it would block the view of from the direction I heard the dog came in. I did not even look and quickly sprint out the other side of the bathroom. I know a dog is more likely to chase you if you run, but I didn't care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got to my car, and got inside. After taking a deep breath, I felt foolish. It's the middle of the day. You can see cars passing by at the entrance of the gas station, this is silly. And it was a dog with a mask stuck on its head, it wasn't going to bite. Why do I have to psych myself up?  If it comes right down to it, I can just fight with this dog. It won't win, I will. That's what I told myself. Then as I was about to drive off, that dog blocked my path. Despite its moving forward cutting in front of me, the mask was turned to its side, directly facing me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honked the horn again. This time something I couldn't explain happened. As the dog rearranged its body to face me, the mask looked like it was readjusted by an invisible hand. The movement of the dog's body couldn't have changed the direction of the mask like that. The dog was now facing me, and so was the mask. \n\n  \nThen, I saw the dog do a motion that I had never seen a dog does before. Its body remained still. But it extended its head forward in a jerking motion. Each time it jerked back and forth, its head seemed to extended out further than the last. After the third time, I felt like the dog's neck stretched out way too far, and I had enough. I put my car in reverse and hightailed out of there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't even exhale until I was on the road. I breathed out then looked to the side, and then I saw it.  The dog was running next to the car. I was going sixty, but it matched the car's speed. Its leg were impossibly long now. They were blurry because they were going fast, but look more like tentacles than legs. And while it was running forward, the smiling tiger mask turned sideway again, looking straight at me, inside the car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen suddenly, a welcome sound is heard. A ten-wheeler blasted its horn from behind me. It sped up and passed me on the same side of the dog. It was going so fast, I could feel the wind shaking the car. After it drove off, I looked to the side and could see that the dog was gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never appreciated existence of 10-wheelers before in my life.",

        "text": "*Below is the transcript found on the phone of Hans Drukker, a 21-year old citizen of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, last seen at Karunadevoor, a small town in the Kozhikode district of Kerala state in the Republic of India. Drukker had a popular video blog known as 'Wereldrukker', and the below videos seem to be recorded for the purpose of uploading it there.* \n\n*The phone was found by a local fisherman named Adheef Panaparambil and duly handed in to Inspector Ramachandran at Karunadevoor police station. Adheef claimed to have found it on the beach at some distance from the historic ruins of Padmanabhavilasam Palace (known by the locals as 'Parangi Nashiccha Kottaram', meaning 'the palace ruined by the foreigner') while returning from his early-morning fishing trip. Upon accessing the phone and investigating, the following videos were found. Police investigation resulted in the declaration of Hans Drukker as a missing person, and the notification of the Dutch embassy.*\n\n\\----\n\nCLIP 1 (Recorded on 14/08/2019)\n\n*HANS DRUKKER, a young man with long blond hair turns on the front facing camera and makes a few adjustments to his hair. He smiles widely, then begins speaking cheerily.*\n\nHANS: Good morning dear friends! Thanks for tuning in to Werldrukker today, please like my video and subscribe if you want to see more of me. If you like this video, check out my previous ones too. Share it with your friends while you're at it, yeah?\n\n*HANS leans back and chuckles, then moves toward the camera confidentially.*\n\nHANS: I've been in India for two weeks, and now have come to this little town in Ko-Koli..nevermind, you see the name on the screen. Now you may wonder, '*Hans, what are you doing in this little backwater?*' Well, fret not, I'm going to tell you.\n\nToday we're going to do something that is my passion; exploring abandoned places! If you follow my previous adventures, you'll see how I have gone to numerous old buildings in the cities I visit. But this time is extra special!\n\nNow a bit of history for you guys. The Dutch East India Company was active up and down this coast in the 1600s, and the local chiefs used to make deals with them, you know, I give you trading rights for my place, and you destroy my enemy with your big guns. Now this town was one of those little chiefdoms. And over here also the same deal went on. But the thing is that, the Dutch guy who made the deal here was my ancestor! That's right, Eustachius van Drukker was the commanding officer of the *Muiden*, the Dutch vessel who landed here. The main reason I came to India actually was to visit this place. Little surprise for all my viewers, eh?\n\nSo near the beach is a palace, with another unpronounceable local name (*laughs*), so I'll just call it the palace for you guys. The story is my great-great-great-something-grandfather, he stayed there for 2 years and learnt some of the local language. But over that time, he fell in love with the chief's court dancer or something? And then the king made him leave, then locked up the dancer. But they say the dancer went mad and cursed the place and it soon faced a lot of misfortunes that made the place uninhabitable. Locals don't even go near it, it's crazy!\n\n*HANS swigs some water from a metal bottle on his bedside.*\n\n*HANS:* I don't really believe in that curse bullshit you know? Maybe my ancestor just had his troops burn down the place or something! (*chuckles*) Anyway, see you there!\n\n*HANS holds his palm to the phone to cover the camera, making the screen blank. End of CLIP 1.*\n\n\\---\n\nCLIP 2 (Recorded on 15/08/2019)\n\n*HANS is walking down a beach, sweat streaming down, holding the phone to show his face.* \n\n*HANS*: Hey guys, now I'm on the beach, walking down to the palace. You know, not one of the taxi or auto-rickshaw drivers wanted to take me there? No matter how much money I gave, they just said no. So I've got to walk!  \n\n\n*HANS pans the camera around him. It's a very bright and sunny day. The sea is on one side, and groves of coconut trees on another. Ahead of him is a boat on the shore, where two fishermen are relaxing.*\n\n*HANS*: It's hot as hell out here! I already finished my water a while back (*brandishing his bottle*), so there's no relief. How do the locals manage? Actually, there seems to be two guys ahead. I'll ask them for some water.\n\n*HANS approaches the boat where the two men were sitting. Both of them were dark-skinned with curly hair, and wore only a lungi, leaving their chests bare. They were subsequently identified by Kerala Police as C. Varunan and V. Basheer, both local fishermen.*\n\nHANS (In English): Hey guys!\n\n*VARUNAN and BASHEER turn toward him, wave and smile. HANS reaches the boat and holds the phone at waist-level, so we can see his head from below.*\n\nHANS (*IN ENGLISH*): Hey, do you know English?\n\nBASHEER: Little-little. What you want?\n\nHANS: Oh that's great! You have water?\n\nVARUNAN: Water, ah? Come, come.\n\n*End of CLIP 2.*\n\n\\---\n\nCLIP 3 (Recorded on 15/08/2019)\n\n*HANS is sitting on a bench in a small shelter with Varunan and Basheer beside him. He is holding a tender coconut with a straw out of it, which he sips from intermittently. He continues to speak in English.*\n\nHANS: Hello everyone, meet my new friends, Varunan and Basheer! Meeting them really was a godsend.\n\n*HANS swings the camera so they are clearly in view. VARUNAN and BASHEER are grinning and wave at the camera. HANS swings the camera back to himself.*\n\nHANS: They not only filled my water bottle, but also got this tender coconut right off a tree for me! Never had anything so cool and sweet before! So, you guys see the hospitality of India? Even for a stranger like me, they dropped everything to help!\n\n*VARUNAN and BASHEER grinning and nodding.*\n\nVARUNAN: Ahh, you said you're going where?\n\nHANS: The palace.. what was it called? Pa...Padam...\n\nVARUNAN (*with wide eyes*): Padmanabhavilasam, ah?\n\nHANS (*cheerfully*): Yeah! That's the one!\n\n*VARUNAN and BASHEER share wide-eyed looks.*\n\nBASHEER (leaning forward): Don't go there. Especially because you're foreign. What we are saying listen. Can save your life.\n\nHANS: That's what all the auto drivers were saying! Not to go. But I really want to go! My ancestor lived there for some years!\n\nVARUNAN (*To BASHEER, softly in Malayalam*): He is that foreigner's descendant!\n\nBASHEER (*to HANS*): Then you surely can't go. Please listen. We know that place. If you are the captain's relative, you stay. We'll guide you wherever you want around this place. Don't go.\n\nHANS: Listen, I've made up my mind to go there. Your old wives' tales won't stop me.\n\nVARUNAN (*frantically*): Not safe. Don't go. Can't say what will happen there. If the woman catches you...\n\nHANS (*slightly annoyed*): Now listen, you don't try to stop me! I appreciate you guys helping me, but you can't tell me what to do!\n\n*VARUNAN goes to say something but stops. BASHEER is already sitting with his head in his hands.*\n\nVARUNAN (*resigned tone*): Then go. But don't say we didn't tell you.\n\n*HANS walks out of the shelter.*\n\n*END OF CLIP 3*\n\n\\---\n\nCLIP 4 (Recorded on 15/08/2019)\n\n*HANS is walking down the beach again. Clearly this was taken only about a minute after the previous clip, as the fishermen's shelter can be seen in the background. HANS is speaking in Dutch again.*\n\nHANS: That was odd, right guys? Locals are really kind, really kind, but also too superstitious. Must be afraid of their own shadows!  And what was all that talk about a woman catching me? I know I have devilishly handsome looks (*he grins at the camera*), but not that much!\n\n Anyway guys, we're approaching the palace at last, there you see it in the distance..\n\nHANS turns the camera around and zooms. In the distance is seen a tiled roof peeking over half-broken, mossy walls. The entire structure has been consumed by the surrounding vegetation.  \n\n\nHANS: It's really a relief to see the end goal in sight. Maybe I should get a couple of bricks from there to give those guys, how about that? (*laughs*)\n\n*END OF CLIP 4*\n\n\\---\n\nCLIP 5 (Recorded on 15/08/2019)\n\n*The camera faces HANS, the sea behind him.*\n\nHANS: Whew, that was way longer than I thought! It took me half an hour to walk from there, even though the building looked close. (*drinks water and exhales*). Anyway, we're at the palace gate! Take a look guys..\n\n*HANS turns the camera. We see the gateway to the palace. The gateway is a small building that was once white, but now was black and green from the corroding forces of nature. The roof would have had tiles, but now merely a few beams clung on, like a reminder of past glory. There were wooden double doors, one of which had fallen and the other which was holding on by a single hinge. Both are significantly decayed.*\n\nHANS: Well, time to go in, I guess..\n\n*HANS walks through the doorway, glancing around. As he steps through, the sound of the wind suddenly falls silent. The main building is some distance away; in traditional architecture of the region, buildings of the wealthy were surrounded by a huge compound. In the corner of the compound is a small building that would have once been a temple to a local deity. Stone paths criss-cross the compound, which would have connected the palace with structures that no longer exist.*\n\nHANS (quietly): This place is crazy, although it's not to big.. hardly a Versailles, yeah? (*HANS weakly chuckles, but the sound is stifled by the oppressive silence in the courtyard.*)\n\n*HANS approaches the temple in the corner. Leaves crunch underfoot, and more than once he starts and looks over his shoulder.*\n\nHANS: Bit creepy out here..I get why the locals don't want to come around. But hey, I've been in worse places. Like that abandoned high-rise out in Medan last year, where that junkie jumped out at me.. I had to buy new pants that day! (*HANS laughs, but he slowly stops and clears his throat.*) A-anyway.\n\n*HANS turns the camera to show the small, shrine. Unlike the rest of the place, the temple seems to be in good condition, with only minimal damage. The walls are still mostly white, and the roof retains most of the tiles. The wooden door is inset with gold decorations, and is bolted with a large, ornate gold latch. HANS' hand reaches out and opens the latch. HANS turns the camera back to himself.*  \n\n\nHANS: Here we go! \n\n*HANS pushes the door open. His expression goes blank, then his eyes widen and he begins to hyperventilate. Wordlessly, his shaking finger approaches the screen. After missing the button a few times, the camera turns around. The shrine doors are open. The platform where the idol would usually be, was replaced by a much decayed traditional Dutch hat, which had a metal pin with the VOC logo, so rusted that it looked like it would crumble. Bones were scattered all throughout the shrine, and a skull displaying signs of blunt force trauma was placed beneath the platform where the hat lay. The walls of the shrine had writings in an older form of Malayalam, made in a crusty brown substance which appears to be blood. The writings were translated as, \"Why did you abandon your beloved? Where have you gone, crossing the sea? All those who stood in our way are now dead. Soon you must come back to me.\"*\n\n*The camera remains in place for almost a minute. After that, HANS suddenly whips around. The phone screen is black presumably due to him putting it in his pocket. After about a minute, HANS is back on screen. The hat seen in the shrine is now on his head. Through the stillness, a faint sound of a female singing, in a tune and language typical of 17th century Kerala, is heard to the accompaniment of anklets. Wordlessly, he starts shuffling toward the palace, his eyes blank. There is a pause in the song, as the anklets continue to ring. HANS begins to mumble, seemingly in the tune of the song. He stops after a short time, and the female voice picks up the song again. As HANS draws closer to the palace, the song and anklets increase in frenzy and intensity. He slowly climbs up the steps of the verandah, and the song can clearly be heard. Set to the tune of a classical dance song, it details the longing of a beloved for her lost lover. Interspersed with it are lines detailing  the tortures the bereaved woman inflicted on those who kept her away from her lover, which were not part of the original composition.* \n\n*HANS waits at the door, occasionally singing in accented Malayalam when the female voice is silent, as if prompted. HANS is not known to have any prior knowledge of the language. The song comes to an end after about ten minutes. The anklets are heard coming closer, rushing to the door, and stopping just on the other side. There is complete stillness for around half a minute. Suddenly, HANS tosses the phone aside, and the camera lands facing upward, recording the mossy, tiled roof which has gaps on it. The door is heard opening and the sounds of Hans' flip-flops along with the anklets are heard receding. The camera records the roof for an hour, during which nothing further is heard or seen, and after which the battery dies.*\n\nEND OF CLIP 5\n\n\\---\n\n*There was no more media on the phone, so it is unknown how it reached the beach, nearly 250 meters away from the palace. The phone was dead when retrieved by Adheef, and had to be started by an IT team from Kozhikode city, upon which the above clips were accessed. Preceding these clips were regular clips shot in Kochi city, where he was staying prior to his arrival at Karunadevoor. Upon viewing the clips, the Kerala Police declared the case closed, and attributed his disappearance to a riptide when he went to swim in the sea. The area of a radius of 150 meters around the Padmanabhavilasam Palace was declared an ecologically protected zone, prohibiting people from entering without a permit. However, fishermen say that if they pass the palace on their boats at night, while breeze blows from the land to the sea, they hear the tinkling of anklets interspersed with frenzied laughter- both male and female.*",

        "text": "When I was in college, I worked for a fetish pornographer. I was a cameraman. The pay was good, the hours were reasonable, it was better than any mc-job I've ever worked at.\n\nI'm an old man as I write this. Just turned 62. I look back on my life and reminisce. Nothing in particular, good times and bad. I think about the time I met my wife, the time we got married, and the exact moment our daughter was born. Precious memories. It seems that, as you age, all you have are memories. Depending on who you ask, that's either a good thing, or a bad, terrible ordeal that makes you lose sleep. \n\n\nThat's why I'm writing all this down. I hope that by doing so will help me sleep at night again. Get back into the groove of life. This isn't the first time I've written to get something off my chest, I was a little shit as a kid. This one time, I was playing in the park with these kids, and one of them dared me to throw a baseball into the front window of what I thought was an abandoned house. I wanted them to think I was cool.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, writing about my problems in the past has done a lot of good for me. I hope by doing it again, it'll do the same. The only difference is, unlike the formerly homeless man of my youth, the man I shall be writing about is somebody I don't want to be in the same breathing air with.\n\n\nIn my college days, I was a much different man than I am now. I was a peacock: every chance I got I'd be out showing off, hoping to get the opportunity to have a girl in my bed whenever one would look my way. \n\n\nCollege was the first time in my life where I was without any parental supervision. When it wasn't my parents, it was either my teachers or God on Sunday looking down on me. Watching my every move. College to me at least was the only time I ever had my own breathing room.\n\n\nAnd boy did I take advantage of it. I must've bed probably 20 girls during my 4 year tour of duty. I was always a gentleman during my conquests. That timed little country boy never really left, even as I became a man. If the girl wasn't interested I wouldn't press the issue further, but of course that rarely ever happened. I always took care of myself. If you know me in real life, you'd be surprised. You'd think I was talking shit. I wasn't always a crotchety old guy, you know.\n\n\n\nI used to have the body of Arnold once. Combined that with wit and a good sense of humor, and my bed was never empty. When I wasn't currently having sex, I was plotting new ways to achieve sex. That's how I ended up working for V.C.M in the first place.\n\n\n\nIt all started one Friday night. My friends and I were up to our usual ways, drinking and raising Hell. We had this little spot outside campus we'd go to get properly lubricated. This Irish place called O'Shiestys Bar and Grill. It was the cheapest place in the neighborhood and were the last to close.\n\n\n\nWe were at the bar, slamming back steins and pretzels looking at the TV. Steins seemed like an odd choice for an Irish bar. It might've been the beer talking, but those pretzels were ungodly delicious. I swear, I've never eaten anything as delicious. This is in no way a guerilla advertising for O'Shiestys Bar and Grill, I'm just saying, they must've put heroin in the dough or something. There's no way, honestly. I'm not exactly a bar food gordan Ramsey, but the food at O'Shiestys is divine.\n\n\n\nI had a pint of beer in my bladder, and without divulging much, I had to hose down Paradise. In the bathroom, I hitched up at a urinal next to this tall guy. He had long black hair and a black cowboy hat. What was eye catching was the conversation we had.\n\n\n\"Hey buddy, want to make $500 bucks?\" He asked.\n\n\nProper men's room etiquette says you should never respond when somebody asks you a question. Unless that question is asking if the stall is open, you never talk to people there. I wish I took my own advice, because I made the mistake of responding to this guy.\n\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm serious, you can make 500 bucks American if you come work for me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Look pal, I'm flattered, but I don't swing that way.\" I replied, washing my hands. \n\n\n\nThe man chuckled.\n\n\n\n\"Well, lucky for you I'm married.\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh, never stopped me before.\" I replied.\n\n\n\nMama, if you're looking down at me while I write this, please forgive me. I was a devil back then, I admit. I'm a changed man, I promise.\n\n\n\n\"I get all the ass I can handle, but this ain't that type of proposal.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whatever. Look pal, do you need something? I don't usually talk to dudes in the John, and I want to keep it that way.\"\n\n\n\n\"You caught me. I'm actually the bathroom stall rapist. Foiled at last.\" He joked.\n\n\n\nI smirked, grabbing a paper towel and wiping my hands off. \n\n\n\n\"What if I told you, you get to be around half naked chicks?\"\n\n\n\nMy ears perked when he said that. Like offering meth to a tweaker, my little rat brain was starting to click.\n\n\n\n\"Now you're speaking my language, Cowboy.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know a little Americano: I run an online media business and I need a new cameraman. The old one, didn't stick around. Religious reasons or something.\"\n\n\n\n\"Online media business, huh? I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you don't shoot weddings.\"\n\n\n\n\"Guilty as charged. The name's VCM, proud father of Black Rabbit Entertainment. We cater to an older audience, if you know what I mean. I'm looking for someone to man the camera at the studio. Are you interested?\"\n\n\n\n\"You know, you're awfully chatty for a stranger in a bathroom. That don't mean I ain't interested in what you have to say.\"\n\n\n\nI paused, before speaking again.\n\n\"You ain't bullshitting when you say I'll make $500 an hour?\"\n\nThe stranger flushes, washes his hands, and begins to reach into his pocket.\n\n\"I swear to God if you whip out your dick I'll kill ya.\"\n\nHe pulled out a black leather wallet and opened it, revealing a blotch of green that looked as thick as a brick.\n\n\"Right now I have 10 thousand dollars in my wallet I carry around everyday. This is pocket money to me. This is nothing, I use this when I run out of toilet paper to wipe my ass.\"\n\n\n\n\"How charming.\"\n\n\n\n\"The point is, I have money to burn. It's no concern of mine. How would you like to feel the same?\" \n\n\n\n\"You know, you could be a cult leader with that silver tongue of yours, Cowboy.\"\n\n\"Who said I'm not?\"\n\n\n\nWith one flick of his wrist, he produced a black little rectangle and held it between two fingers encased in even blacker leather gloves.\n\n\n\n\"I don't bite, but the girls I work with do.\"\n\n\n\nI snatched it out of his hand, the card felt smooth. Perhaps vinyl? Both sides were black, on the front of the card was the outline of what looked like the Playboy rabbit. Except this one had a floppy let ear, had beady eyes, and a red bow tie. In yellow font, it read \"Black Rabbit Productions.\" On the card's backside, the phrase \"We're all nasty\" was written in quotations.\n\n\n\n\"If you're not doing anything important tomorrow, how about you give me a call? I gotta go, don't know about you but I got a game to watch. Adiòs.\"\n\n\n\nWith that, he left. I left the bathroom and returned to my friends, who were still drinking.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Paul, thought you fell in. Who was that? Your boyfriend?\" My friend Pete asked, clearly drunk and slurring his words.\n\n\n\n\"Man, shut up. That guy offered me a job, actually.\"\n\n\n\n\"A job? About time, with your broke ass.\"\n\n\n\nI like Pete, I really do, but he has a big mouth. I can't deal with him when he's drunk. With the remaining dignity I had, I paid for my drinks and left.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, get back to your boyfriend. I always knew you were a homo.\"\n\n\n\nI flipped him off before leaving the building. On my drive home I considered what that guy said. Was he actually telling the truth? Or telling me what I wanted to hear? 500 bucks for just pointing a camera? There had to be more to it. Nobody gets paid that much to do practically nothing. \n\n\n\nAt the time, I was too buzzed to think straight. I was too busy thinking with my head that my brain was collecting dust. I'd have to sleep on it before I make any further decisions. \n\n\nI wish I never even spoke to that man. I should have told him to fuck off when I had the chance. I wish I threw that damn card out the window. But then, I wouldn't be writing all this if I made the right decision.\n\n\n\nI went to bed that night and woke up at noon the next day. My mind all but blanked from the night before. It took me a second to register what exactly happened, but seeing VC's card on the nightstand jogged it all back.\n\n\n\nI just stared at it for awhile. Should I or should I not call the number, If I don't call, it'll all be as if it were a dream. But, if I do, a whole new genre of pussy was within reach, assuming V was telling the truth. \n\n\nAs the phone rang, I couldn't help but feel giggly. I felt like a little kid doing something naughty, like stealing a pack of gum from the store without getting noticed. It felt like I was doing something I wasn't supposed to, that rush of knowing you're not supposed to do it makes it so exciting.\n\n\n\nFinally, they picked up.\n\nI had a brief conversation with the receptionist, explaining what happened last night. She was nice enough, very understanding. I like that in customer service.\n\n\nI hang up and look at the wall on the other side of the room. My roommate was sleeping off a hangover, a chainsaw revving couldn't wake him up. I didn't have to be too quiet. I was still tired from the night before, I could spend the day sleeping or I can actually be a good student and catch up on the ever growing stack of late work that was piling up.\n\n\n\nI could do all that, or, I can take VC up on his offer.  I've always been up for adventure, taking this job would be right up my alley. Who knows, I might like it. I sure as Hell wasn't gonna be cooped up in here all day with my nose in books.\n\n\n\nHow bad could it be? Honestly? I took a shower, brushed my teeth, combed my hair, sprayed on deodorant, and grabbed my car keys. I knew where the Vanderbilt Garage was so I didn't have to look it up on Google maps. But while I was online, I thought I'd look up Black Rabbit Productions. I didn't find a whole lot, but I did find an article that caught my eye.\n\n\n\n\"Woman missing for 2 weeks found at the bottom of a ravine.\"\n\n\n\n\"24 year old Jennifer Nichols was found dead at Yosemite National Park after being missing for 2 weeks. Former Black Rabbit actress went missing just a week before Thanksgiving, a statewide missing persons search was led by her husband.\"\n\n\n\nGod, I can't imagine having someone you love vanish out of thin air like that. Only to be found dead, I suppose bad news is better than waiting up at night for a wife that's never coming home. \n\n\n\nAs tragic and soul crushing as that is, and don't get me wrong that is a tragedy, I have the feeling there's more to the story than what the paper says. Nobody just vanishes like that, just out of the blue. Was she kidnapped? Did she go out for smokes and keep on driving? We're nowhere near Yosemite, did she drive all the way over there to become a hermit? Start a new life? It just doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\nWhat gave me a weird feeling was her choice of career. Black Rabbit. Maybe I'm just jumping the gun. Is there a chance that VC's luring girls off the street and killing them? This whole thing is making my head spin. I don't know this guy, for all I know he could be a freak. I should bring a knife with me, just in case he tried something.\n\n\n\nThis was all happening so fast. I should get a hold of myself before I make a hasty decision. For all I know, this guy could not be some secret serial killer. Just because someone who worked for him died, doesn't mean he killed her. If some old lady working for Walmart was found dead in her home, does that mean the Walton Family themselves put a hit on her? No. For all I know, this could be a case of suicide. I mean, it makes sense. She drove all the way to Yosemite to see something pretty before she took her dirt nap. \n\n\n\nSeeing that article gave me a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. My drive to Vanderbilt was tense, I didn't have the radio on the entire trip. And I always have it on, it breaks the silence. I needed time to think. I thought to myself, \"should I be doing this? I could turn around right now and be done with it.\". I shrugged it off, chalked it up to jitters. I just thought I was getting inside my own head about it. \n\n\n\nAll I know was at the end of this trip, I had the chance for some major boobage. And I wasn't gonna pass it up. In hindsight, I shouldn't have been so excited. I could go online and look up tits for free.\n\n\n\nA half hour later, I pulled into the dirt parking lot that encircled the garage. I hate parking far away, especially if I had a wicked shit to take. But I did that on purpose, it allowed me to survey the area. Take in the sights. Locate possible exits. I've always passed by this place, but never took the time to look closely at it. It was always a background area, like Wyoming. A piece of the scenery. \n\n\n\nThe Vanderbilt logo was long faded, only a blue V was left untouched by the cold hand of time. It looked like a super villain hideout, it was definitely being used by a monster. When I was younger, I used to be really into history, specifically local history. Vanderbilt was an oil man who set up shop here in the 50s. But thanks to the 2008 recession, they cashed out. The only living relic of the Vanderbilt Empire is the laboratory South side. \n\n\n\nThe building itself was a warehouse with 3 large garage doors to the left side of the building. Fitting, oil trucks are massive. There was no other cars in the parking lot except mine and a polished 76' dodge charger. I'll give him credit, for a \"potential\" serial killer, VCM had good taste in cars. \n\n\n\nI crossed the road leading to the main building and walked inside. The receptionist on the phone was sitting at an oak desk in the middle of the room. She was attractive, in a bored housewife sort of way. No disrespect at all, I always had a thing for older women. That's why my wife's 72. Even before our kids had kids, I'd call her grandma. She doesn't seem to mind.\n\n\n The receptionist smiled at me as I introduced myself. \"I'm Paul, from the phone. I'm here for the position.\"\n\n\n\"Oh yes, we've been expecting you. Please, down the hall to the right. VC is expecting you in his office. Welcome aboard Paul.\" She said in a cheery voice that seemed genuine.\n\n\n\nI thanked her and made my way down the hall. Country music was playing on the speakers as I made the journ. I don't mind country, I honestly don't. If i'm in a car with someone and they have country on, I'm not gonna be a dick and have them change it. Sometimes I voluntarily put on country.\n\n\n\nSo does VC I see. On the walls, I see memorabilia from a time before me. In a glass case on the wall was an old, worn out flag. It looked burned on one side. On the bottom there was a little caption that read \"Remember The 2nd\". On another wall, in another glass case was a license plate from Tennessee. This caption read, \"Nashville  was my Fort Sumter\"\n\n\n\nWas this guy in the 2nd? I mean, he had to be. The Nashville Hijacking started the war, and here he was with a Tennessee licence place. In case you're unaware, \"The 2nd\" is what we call the 2nd U.S. civil war. A terrorist attack in Nashville back in the day started the war. I read about this, it was my favorite subject in school.\n\n\nVCM was a civil war veteran, from the looks of it. This guy was getting cooler by the second. I wonder how much pussy he gets?  Man fought for his country and he gets to spend the rest of his life surrounded by the finest babes this side of the Mason Dixon line. VC was starting to win me over that moment, I will admit. I wasn't overly patriotic, but I couldn't help but feel inspired by the guy. Going through hell in the Heartland can't be easy, my grandpa was a veteran of the 2nd and the poor guy had to be hospitalized. If he copes by looking at fat titties all day then God bless him.\n\n\nI'm ashamed at how easy it was to be suckered in by him. He had the charisma of a TV preacher, just without the accent. VCM was a real life superman. Somebody to idolize and look up to. How foolish was I to believe him. I don't doubt the blood he sacrificed to protect this country tis of thee, but they say the most deadly of predators appear non threatening.\n\n\n\nMy daughter is big into animals, she's studying to be a veterinarian you see. She tells me all this stuff about animals and most of the time I can't understand a word she says. But the most interesting aspect about her field of study are the stories she tells. One time she told me about a friend of hers who lived on a farm. One day, she goes out to pasture and sees one of the prize bulls on it's back dead. She thought it had to be the work of coyotes or some other beast looking for a meal in the dead of night. An animal that strong doesn't just keel over for no reason.\n\n\n\nTo make a long story short, what killed the bull was this little parasitic wasp. Perhaps you're aware of the tarantula hawk? The nasty little critter that makes a nursery out of living spiders? This bug's similar. What it does is it lays eggs inside the cuts and open wounds of larger game. It's kids get a free ride and a free lunch, much to the expense of the host. Turned out there was a hive of those nasty little Devil bugs in an old hollow log out there in the grazing field. It's kinda impressive when you think about it, a little wasp taking down a huge bull like that. \n\n\n\n The most dangerous enemy you'll face in this life are the ones who don't seem like a threat outwardly. The silent assassins of the world. The foulest creature has the prettiest smile.\n\n\n\nVCM had me where he wanted me. I kept walking down the hallway, admiring the artifacts when I reached a windowless set of double doors. I opened them and honestly, I felt like I just stepped into a whole other world. The brightly lit lobby I just came from disappeared and was replaced with this dark corridor. The only lights were focused on these life sized photos of women with their mouths wide open and their bare torsos exposed. Some of these women had their tongues out, most of them had this longing gaze.\n\n\n\nI recoiled physically upon entering this part of the building. I guess I got so preoccupied gazing at his war memorabilia that I must've forgotten for a minute that this was a porn studio I was in. I'll give VC credit though, these women were clearly grown ups. Nothing fishy happening in that direction.\n\n\n\nI can only assume the women on those walls were past actresses. Women who worked for VC at one point in their lives. The song \"Maneater\" and \"Hungry like the Wolf\" were playing on loop in this section. I kept on walking, taking my time to carefully look at each and every girl he had. One photo that stuck out was that of a model by the stage name of \"Zelda\". Now, this particular photo didn't stand out in the way you'd think. It wasn't different from any of the other pictures in the gallery.\n\n\n\n\"Zelda\" was the same woman from the article. The woman who was found dead in Yosemite. To this day, I still have no idea if VCM was responsible for that girl's death or not. If the man did kill her, he'd most likely try to cover his tracks. He wouldn't have a life sized photo of his victim just hung up out in the open like that, he'd burn that photo to ash. Wash his hands of the whole situation. You can't be acquitted if the victim never existed. On the other hand, there's the possibility that he really is some psycho maniac. Well, more than usual. He keeps photos of his victims around as some sort of sick souvenir. A reminder of all his wicked \"adventures\".\n\n\n\nEither way, looking at her knowing that she was dead didn't sit right. As a matter of fact, that entire hallway was giving me the creeps. I didn't want to stick around longer than I had to. I quickened my pace, speeding down the black and red felt covered floors. At the end of the hall was a dead end, to the very left was a door labeled \"studio\" while the door on the right was labeled \"management\". I went right.\n\n\n\nI knocked on the door. A gruff voice from the other side said to come in. I opened the door, inside two men were waiting to see me. VCM and this bald man with a beard wearing a tactical vest. Was he a cop? I had no idea. \"Hey, broseph, long time no see. You know, I didn't exactly get your name last night. What was it again?\"\n\n\n\n\"Paul.\" I replied.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Paul, are you ready to start your first day? I should say, I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist. I just expect pure, top tier excellence out of you and anything less is a fireable offense.\"\n\n\n\nHe was straight faced as he said it. Then he chuckled.\n\n\n\n\"Kid I'm fucking with ya. Relax, why so serious? In all seriousness, I'm sure you'll do fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, it's just, who's he?\" I asked, pointing to the other guy.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, he's Travis. He's the head of security around here. And my number 2. He's the eyes and ears of the business. I owe this guy my life honestly, he keeps all the creeps and weirdos out. I can't tell you how many times some freak tried to come up in here and try to cop a feel with the girls in the back. Good ole Travis here keeps order.\n\n\n\n\"Speaking of, Travis if you don't mind.\"\n\n\n\nTravis walks over to me with a black metal detector.\n\n\n\n\"Could you keep your hands up for me for a second?\" He instructed, an Irish inflection to his voice.\n\n\n\nUp until that point, I completely forgot about the knife I brought with me. I was debating myself if I should tell them or not. They were gonna find out anyway, might as well tell them the truth.\n\n\n\n\"It's just a formality. We do this to everyone, I assure you. Never know if somebody has anthrax, am I right?\" VC chuckled at his own joke while Travis rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"I should tell you guys right now that I brought a knife with me. Just in case I were mugged on the way here. This side of town gets pretty crazy, especially during summer.\" I ad-libbed. I couldn't tell him the exact truth. It would've been embarrassing.\n\n\n\n\"I actually brought the knife on the off chance you might be a serial killer.\"\n\n\n\nI couldn't say that. Thankfully the subject wasn't dwelled on too long.\n\n\n\n\"Tell me about it, I don't leave the house without my 38. Ain't getting jumped tonight, that's for sure.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, he's clean.\" Travis said, returning to parade rest at V's side.\n\n\n\n\"Goody. Come with me kid, allow me to show you an entirely different plane of existence.\"\n\n\n\nV led the way, leading me out of the office and into the studio. Travis stayed behind, watching me through cracks in the drywall. That guy gives me the creeps, still to this day I have nightmares of him somehow finding me. Kicking my door down in the dead of night and pulling a bullet in my chest. As I write this, I live across the country. The thought of black rabbit tracking me down is slim to none. But not impossible. I live in a constant state of fear, not only for myself but for my family. If they come back, I'll be ready.\n\n\n\nI accompanied VC to the studio. A large room filled with filming equipment opened up in front of me. \"This is where the magic is made, my friend. Luckily for you, today's a rather easy first day. The only item on the agenda is a commission piece. Some rich guy from Japan paid us 20 grand for a birthday tribute video.\" VC explained.\n\n\n\nFrom across the room, the sound of clicking high heels comes ever so close. A woman in glasses came marching over, she looked frazzled. She was holding a clipboard. She had red hair and the longest legs of any chick I've ever seen. She went right up to VC and whispered something to him. I couldn't help but overhear a little bit of their private conversation. \n\n\"The girls are ready sir.\" \n\n\n\n\"Wonderful, is *everything* ready?\" He asked.\n\n\n\n\"I do believe so.\"\n\n\n\n\"Awesome. Dim the lights, get everything in order. It's about 2 minutes to Showtime.\"\n\n\n\nI guess they must've caught onto the fact I was eavesdropping, because the woman in Red let out an audible \"who's the new guy?\"\n\n\n\nCrap. Momma always said Jesus hates an eavesdropper. \n\n\n\n\"Mrs. Nancy, this here is Paul. He's the new camera operator specialist.\" VC said in a tone that sounded a lot like sarcasm.\n\n\n\n\"New guy, huh? Nice to meet you.\"\n\n\n\nTo be polite, I stuck my hand out for a handshake. The woman in Red looks at me like I brought her a flaming bag of dog shit.\n\n\n\n\"Don't take this the wrong way, Paul, but I don't shake hands on the first day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh.\" I said, awkwardly putting my hand back down. \n\n\n\n\"The last camera guy lasted a week. The one before just 2 days. Prove yourself around here and maybe, just maybe.\"\n\n\n\nDid I do something wrong? I couldn't have been that noticeable listening in. I wasn't exactly doing that on purpose. It's like, I acknowledge I was doing it, but you don't have to be such a bitch about it. Is that such a controversial opinion to have?\n\n\n\nWhatever, maybe I caught her on a bad day or something. Film sets can be pretty hectic. So much running around, trying to get everything 100% perfect. Set design, lighting, sound rigging. There's about a million and 1 things to do just to get everything just right. It's like war, no time for stupid questions. Keep your head down, do what you're told, and you might just survive.\n\n\n\nIt's a lot like trucking in a way. The yard can get crazy busy sometimes. I understand the rush of and hustle of the workload. Who knows, maybe Nancy and I will become the best of friends. Maybe even a little more.\n\n\n\nI sucked it up and took my place on set. The \"set\" wasn't that complicated. There was a queen bed with one of those valentines heart headboards. There was a middle aged woman sitting at the foot of the bed. She was wearing lion face paint and ripped up clothes. The face paint didn't do much to hide her age, not that I minded. She actually looked nice. I gave her a half hearted wave and she waved back. At least she was a lot nicer than Sarah.\n\n\n\nNext to the bed was a prop dresser and a prop wardrobe. There was a black chest on the dresser, it was the same velvet used in the portrait room. It had thumb sized holes all over, maybe a finger's length apart. It looked like one of those boxes they used to haul mice at petco. I didn't think anything about it, I was mainly focused on getting the camera set up. It didn't take too long, it was relatively new but manageable to operate.\n\n\n\n\"You the guy, huh?\" The woman on the bed asked.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, uh, my name's Paul.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nice to meet ya, Paul. I'm Nicole. How are you liking the place so far?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's alright, I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Trust me, you'll love it. It takes a while, but you get used to it. It grows on you. You learn to love it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whatever you say.\"\n\n\n\n\"Want some advice? Do everything Velvl tells you to, and everything will be fine. He's a genius.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can't say too much, I don't want to stress my throat out. But I will say this, don't piss him off.\"\n\n\n\nHer last statement caught me off guard. \n\n\n\n\"Okay?\" I replied back.\n\n\n\n\"Relax, you'll do fine.\"  \n\n\n\nDon't piss him off? What's that supposed to mean? To me, it sounded more like a threat than a friendly piece of advice. \n\n\n\nShould I even be here? Ever since I stepped foot into the building, I've been having this weird feeling. I've tried to ignore it, but I can't deny it anymore. It's honestly like the baseball incident all over again. It's a matter of \"should I stay, should I go?\" There's nothing stopping me from running if I really wanted to. Not like he knows where I live.\n\n\n\nI sighed. I honestly don't know what to think. All I know is I'm here and while I'm here I might as well stick it out.\n\n\n\n\"Quiet on set please.\" VC announced.\n\n\n\n\"Good luck.\" Nicole whispered. \n\n\n\nI got into position and readied the camera. Nicole fixed her posture and stared at the camera with a longing gaze. I couldn't help but get an erection looking at her.\n\n\n\n\"We go live in 3, 2,\"\n\n\n\nHe mouthed 1 and motioned me to press record. I did as he instructed.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Miagi, this is your girl Cat-lin Jenner. We here at Black Rabbit wanted to wish you a very happy birthday. 57 is such a big number, you're mommy's big boy.\" Nicole said breathily.\n\n\n\n\"I think mommy's special boy should be rewarded on such a special day. What's a special birthday without a special birthday cake? You're in luck, because mommy is just soo hungry. I can hardly stand it, the hunger pangs. I should eat something. What do you think mommy should eat?\"\n\n\n\nSo far so good. The footage was coming in nice, the audio was perfect, and my I was as hard as an oak tree. Maybe I got VC all wrong, Hell this was a dream job! 500 an hour just to point a camera? Hell I would've done it for free.\n\n\n\n\"I can hardly stand it anymore.\" Nicole moaned.\n\n\n\n\"I need something to eat, and bad. Luckily for you, I know exactly what.\"\n\n\n\nNicole stands up and walks over to the black chest. She opens it and smiles. \n\n\n\n\"Oh hello, what do we have here?\" She asks, licking her lips.\n\n\n\nI was starting to get invested in the story, you see. I wanted to see where this was going more than anyone. \n\n\n\nNicole grabs the chest and walks back to the bed.\n\n\n\n\"I found something that might just fill this big belly of mine.\"\n\n\n\nShe reaches into the chest and pulls out, I shit you not, a newborn coyote. Its eyes were closed and were no bigger than her palm. Must've been a premature birth.\n\n\n\nMy eyes widened. If I wasn't paying attention before, I sure as shit was now.\n\n\n\nWas this some type of bit they were doing? Some injoke I wasn't aware of? Either way, I was wondering where they were going with this. I had pins and needles piercing into me like broken glass. Shit was getting sketchy.\n\n\n\n\"Not exactly a full course meal, but I think it should do the job just nicely. God, I can feel it throbbing inside me right now. Hell, I'm probably doing it a favor. Little guy can't make it in the wild anyway, I'm just putting it out of its misery.\"\n\n\n\nNicole grabbed the coyote pup and placed it on her bare stomach.\n\n\n\n\"Hear that little guy, you're gonna die inside the gut of a superior predator. Just like nature intended.\"\n\n\n\nMy boner I had before was nowhere to be found. I felt like a kid seeing a horror movie I was way too young for. Sweat was forming at the top of my forehead. I felt like I shouldn't see this. I shouldn't be anywhere near this. My stomach was starting to form a fist sized knot. This is starting to become uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nThe coyote pup started to squeal, which Nicole took as a sign to torment it further.\n\n\n\n\"Hear that? It can't wait to be eaten. It's entire life was leading up to this moment. To become my dinner. It knows its place at the bottom of the food chain. It can't wait to die.\"\n\n\n\nNicole picked it up and began to lick its twitching little body. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I exclaimed. This was too much. This is turning into some fucked up fetish shit. \n\n\n\nI began to get nauseas. My mouth was watering and my stomach was lurching. I had to leave, I had to run. Get as far from this hell house as possible. Just drive, drive until I'm either out of gas or out of state.\n\n\n\nA cold piece of metal pressed into the side of my head. A clicking sound stung my ear.\n\n\n\n\"Stop recording for any reason, and I will kill you.\" VC growled.\n\n\n\nI knew the sound of a loaded revolver. It wasn't new. My grandpa used to take me hunting when I was little. His side arm was a dirty harry style 44 magnum. I learned to shoot with that gun. All my life I was taught what to do if I had a bear charge at me.\n\n\n\nNever in my life had I ever had someone hold a gun to my head.\n\n\n\n\"Hey man, take it easy.\" I whimpered.\n\n\n\n\"Sssssh, the video's not over yet.\" He replied.\n\n\n\nHe dug through my pants, trying to find the knife I told him about. Like a jackass. \n\n\n\nHe found it. He yanked it from out of my waistband, and I swear to God he was getting off to it. \n\n\n\n\"You won't be needing this. Keep filming, Paulie.\"\n\n\n\nI could feel this layer of ooze form the moment he called me Paulie. It felt like a greasy, oozing snake was wrapping around my throat, coiling ever so tightly around my windpipe. Hell, i'm sure that's something the mother fucker gets off too. I wouldn't put it past him.\n\n\n\nNicole was tormenting that poor creature with her tongue, leaving no inch without desecration. She giggled whenever the coyote struggled or whined. This was a sick game to them, it was clear by the sheer disregard for the coyote's very life. It wasn't a living, sentient creature. It was just a prop to these people. Nothing more nothing less. It makes me ill. \n\n\n\nFor all I know, maybe VC did kill that woman. I'll bet money on it. He either killed that woman, or some of his little henchmen did the deed. Either way, he had something to do with it. \n\n\n\nAt that moment, all I could think about was momma. I was all she had left. Dad died when I was just a boy, and my so-called brother skipped town the moment he came of age. If I were to die, she'd be all alone. I couldn't do that to her. I wouldn't do that to her. I refused to put her through all that. \n\n\n\nI have facial hair. I am a grown ass man. But at that moment, all I could think of was running back to the safety of momma. I started to cry. Never in my 62 years on this planet have I ever cried real tears before besides that moment. I've teared up during sad parts of movies, sure, but I'm talking about full on thumb sucking weeping. It was all I could do.\n\n\n\n\"What are you crying for, Paulie? This is the best part.\"\n\n\n\nThe gravely venom in this man's voice stung like a bullet. I was at an impasse. He took my only form of self defense besides my fists. I needed those to film his perverted little game. I was powerless. I couldn't do anything. I kept my hands on the camera, doing what he said. Praying he wouldn't shoot me. As long as I play along, I'll be fine. \n\n\n\nIt was a pipe dream, I see that now. How did I know VC was gonna keep his word? To tell the truth, I didn't. I had no way of knowing. I was shitting myself, praying to the good Lord above that this lunatic doesn't kill me in cold blood. I was white knuckling that camera like a raft in a hurricane. Hanging on for dear life. It was my saving grace, my salvation. I was screwed without it.\n\n\n\nWithout thinking, I blurted out \"You really gonna fucking shoot me?\"\n\n\n\nI wasn't even trying to hide how scared I was.  That might've been the stupidest thing I have ever said to another person. And I said some dozeys. \n\n\n\nVCM chuckled.\n\n\n\n\"You talk too much. Think about this logically for a moment, shall we? Why would I shoot you on video? The camera guy. You worry too much kid.\"\n\n\n\nHe pulled the barrel of the revolver away from my skull.\n\n\n\"That don't mean stop.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough he wasn't holding it directly to the base of my head, he was still pointing a gun at me. It felt like a hundred years since I last took a breath. I exhaled like it was my first time doing so. I wasn't out of the woods just yet, but the hard part was over. \n\n\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n\n\nNicole sucked on the coyote pup's head like some fucked up lollipop. I was gagging at this point. The lunch I had earlier was about to make a comeback tour all over the concrete. All the while the fucker was cackling like it was the funniest thing in the world.\n\n\n\n\"Cat-lin is the best in the business. Doesn't complain, doesn't ask questions. She just does her job. And with more enthusiasm than any other chick I've worked with. God she's good.\"\n\n\n\nNicole spat the coyote out and smiled. \"Hmm, yummy. Can't wait for you to go down. Oh what the hell?\"\n\n\n\nBack into her mouth it went, except this time the entire animal's body went along for the ride. The bitch thought she was being cute by closing her lips around its feet. There's nothing cute about this. This is sick and depraved. The fact there's a market for this makes me lose sleep at night. Honestly.\n\n\n\nNicole tilted her head back and made this God awful gulping. It was wet and guttural, it sounded like choking. I hope that bitch choked after all these years. Poetic justice if you ask me. \n\n\n\nOnce her \"meal\" was finally down her throat, she rubbed her exposed belly and blew a kiss towards the camera. At least it's over now.\n\n\n\n\"Hope you enjoyed that, Miagi. I know I did. And thank you daddy V for the meal.\"\n\n\n\nNicole licked her lips and threw her head back moaning.\n\n\n\n\"And CUT!\" VC yelled.\n\n\n\nNicole laughed.\n\n\n\n\"Not bad kid, I kinda expected you to pass out by now.\"\n\n\n\nVC took the camera from my hands and manually stopped the recording. I was too stunned to react. I felt like I was flashbanged. I was dizzy and light headed. My whole world was foggy. For a moment I thought I was having a stroke.\n\n\n\n\"Once again, kitty Kat, you made me proud.\" VC replied, his basey voice echoing throughout the high walled room. It was as if for a moment, I had died and gone to hell and Satan himself was welcoming me. In a way, it was. Believe me when I say, that man's voice is demonic. As deep as the circles of hell itself.\n\n\n\n\"It was my pleasure, daddy.\" Nicole swooned.\n\n\n\nVC turns to me and sighs.\n\n\n\n\"I'll have to edit out Paulie boy's pansy ass crying, but other than that the shot was great. Not bad kid.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't respond. I was still too zoned out to notice anything. You know that feeling when your leg falls asleep? It's numb at first but once you move it around you have about maybe 10 seconds before it starts hurting like a mother? That's how my entire body felt.\n\n\n\n\"PAUL!\"  VC shouted, pulling me out of my daze.\n\n\n\n\"A deal's a deal, here's a thousand bucks.\" \n\n\n\nHe pulled out his wallet and pulled out 10 Ben Franklins. I looked at him like he threw me a severed head.\n\n\n\n\"What did you just say?\"\n\n\n\n\"Your cut. Here. I'm a man of my word, not a lot of us left.\" He chuckled.\n\n\n\n\"What in the actual fuck IS WRONG WITH YOU?! I don't want your fucking money, you sicko, I want to get the fuck out of here!\"\n\n\n\nBefore he could say anything else, I bolted. I ran back the way I entered, through the portrait gallery, through the lobby, and out the double doors. I say \"out\" even though \"through\" would be more accurate. Those shits were glass, I ran through like I was the mother fucking kool aide man. I still have the scar to this day. I tell folk I was stabbed, it's better than telling the truth. That I got it escaping a sex weirdo's lair.\n\n\n\nIt was just about sundown; my car was still there in the dirt lot, it never looked more beautiful. I managed to actually slide across the hood and hop inside. Key in ignition, I peeled out and hauled ass all the way home. In the car, I couldn't stop painting. It felt like it was raining sandpaper down in my lungs. It hurt to breathe.\n\n\n\nA few blocks away from my dorm, at a stoplight, I had a meltdown. I was high off adrenaline, and once the weight of what just happened finally crashed down, I couldn't stop laughing. I was laughing like the joker after nuking Gotham; I was straight cackling. Why shouldn't I? I made it out of a dangerous situation alive, I have the right to laugh.\n\n\n\nThen I started crying again. I cried like my oldest son died in my arms, that's how bad it was. I was inconsolable. My eyes ached along with the rest of my body. I looked out the window, seeing birds sitting in the trees and bees pollinating flowers. How I took it all for granted. I was too busy getting laid. I wasn't appreciating life. It's funny in a way; I didn't realize how good life was until I was inches away from losing it.\n\n\n\nI called my mother at that stoplight. I've never felt more vulnerable and scared before in my life. I felt like a little boy: the only way a boy feels safe is in the arms of his momma.\n\n\n\nI dialed. She picked up and I told her everything. I couldn't stop crying. \n\nPlease. I implore you. Stay away from black rabbit. I don't care what they told you or how good it seems. Stay the fuck away, don't go down the rabbit hole like I did.",

        "text": "Hey guys, first time poster here, I only thought about this recently, and I really had to dig it up. After watching a bunch of Reddit scary story reading videos, I felt that something unsettling and weird had happened to me in the past, but I couldn’t place my finger on it. I thought for a few minutes and the first thing that came to my mind was a big red house in the middle of the forest. Then the rest came flooding back.\n\nI was a lot younger at the time, probably around 7 or 8 when this occurred. I had been playing around with rollerblades with my friend in my grandma’s driveway when I suggested that we go to this cool hangout spot in the forest. It’s on a path where you walk along just inside the tree line and then make a left and there’s a concrete tube to sit on and chill. Me and my cousins used to go there when we were bored and wanted to do our own thing separate from the adults. \n\nBeing the impatient, immature child I was, I decided that I didn’t need to take off my rollerblades despite the uselessness and even hindrance they would pose out there. My friend on the other hand, had a lot more sense and put shoes on, while he was inside I told him to ask his brother if he wanted to come. He was also my friend, but he said he wasn’t feeling up to it. I swear these details are important. When we got out there (it wasn’t very far) it didn’t take long for us to become bored and play games. We played hide and seek, tag, and other miscellaneous games before we decided to walk further into the forest. We got to a point where the path split off on the left perpendicular to the main path. I take a few heavy steps with my rollerblades and then feel my feet sink. I stepped in mud.\n\nWith my favorite rollerblades drenched with mud and my socks a little wet we continue on carefully. Eventually we happen upon a clearing. In the middle of the clearing there was a big red house. I say that, but it didn’t seem to serve as a house. It was very wide and long but not very tall. I was an average sized 7 or 8 year old and I could reach on my tippy toes and look through the window on the door. It was holding a bunch of random stuff that I really couldn’t make out despite looking for a long time. All I knew was that there was an unsettling amount of clutter in there. Seeing as though we were in the middle of the forest it didn’t seem like the most likely place for storage. I stepped aside to let my friend look, and after looking for a only a few seconds he jumped away from the door and said “we need to leave”. He was taller than me and could get a better look than me, so I don’t know if I couldn’t see it or just didn’t but he never told me what “it” was, no matter how many times I would ask. After looking around for a bit, a realization hit us like a freight train, the big clearing was a circle, and the brush was a little thick leading up to it. We didn’t know our way back.\n\nAfter a while of panicking, we came up with a plan. We start at the same spot and walk in opposite directions until we found where we came in. Not long into this plan did we come to find that it was useless. Not because it wouldn’t work, but because we heard what sounded like his brother’s voice coming from the edge of the forest line. We followed his voice assuming he had come out to find us after we had been out for a while. His voice did lead us back to the trail, but we never saw him. We walked our way back, unsettled and uncomfortable, until we made our way back to the house. When we got there, we asked his brother if he remembers going out and screaming for us. He said no. Me and my friend looked at each other with terror on our faces. I distinctly remember his brother’s voice, we didn’t understand what he was saying, but we both agreed it sounded just like him.\n\nMy grandmother was not very pleased to find my rollerblades covered in mud. She scolded me, but told me that it will wash off and that I should be more careful with them. Although, being a kid, I was just as impatient as I was lazy. I never really got around to cleaning my rollerblades. I specifically remember them staying dirty for a very long time and I also remember thinking about the red house in the middle of the forest every time I saw them.\n\nAfter a while I asked my friend if he remembered the encounter. He said he did not remember. I explained everything I remembered and he told me he remembered going into the forest, but didn’t remember a red house, or me stepping in mud, or hearing his “brother’s” voice. I asked him how could he forget, seeing as though he’s the one that encouraged me to leave because he saw something in there. He said I was losing my mind.\n\nAs time passed on the mud flaked off of my rollerblades, and so too did the memory flake out of my mind. I didn’t think of this for almost 10 years until just the other day. After seeing some Reddit videos on YouTube about scary stories, I had a hunch that I had one of those stories too. It took so long to come to me, but when I remembered it, I was so unsettled, I thought “how could I forget?” Although, not 10 minutes ago, after seeing similar videos, did that tip of my tongue feeling come back. With only a day or two in between now and when I first thought about it, I had completely forgotten, until I remembered the red house, and once again, it all came flooding back. \n\nMy brain seems to want to forget this completely, and yet I will not let it. Even though it worked on everyone else. There’s so many questions and absolutely no answers, but all I know is that whatever was out there I was not supposed to see.",

        "text": " It was a dark and stormy night, and Sarah was all alone in her room. She had always slept with a night light on, but tonight, she woke up to them off, leaving her in complete darkness. As she lay there, trying to calm her racing heart, she heard a soft shuffling sound coming from the other side of the bed. At first, Sarah tried to convince herself it was just the wind, but the sound grew louder and more distinct. Suddenly, she felt a cold hand wrap around her ankle and pull her towards the edge of the bed. She screamed, but the hand only tightened its grip.\n\nTrembling with fear, Sarah managed to reach for the lamp on her nightstand and turn it on. What she saw made her blood run cold. There, on the other side of the bed, was a figure unlike anything she had ever seen before. Its eyes were empty, black voids, and its skin was a sickly pale color. Sarah tried to run, but she was paralyzed with fear. The figure slowly crawled towards her, its body contorting in unnatural ways. She closed her eyes and prayed for it to end, but when she opened them again, the figure was right in front of her, its breath hot on her face.\n\nIt whispered, \"We have always been here, my dear. We are your bedfellows.\" Sarah screamed and passed out. When she awoke, she was in a hospital room, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They told her she had been found unconscious in her room, with no sign of the figure she had seen. But Sarah knew the truth. Her bedfellows were still there, waiting for her in the darkness. She could feel their presence, watching her every move. She never slept peacefully again, always looking over her shoulder, always listening for the shuffling sound that would signal their return.\n\nSarah soon became obsessed with discovering the truth about her bedfellows. She began reading every book and article she could find on the paranormal, seeking any information that might help her understand what she had experienced. She learned that there were others who had seen similar creatures, beings that lurked in the shadows, waiting to claim their next victim. Some believed they were demons, others claimed they were the remnants of the dead, seeking revenge for some past wrongdoing.\n\nRegardless of the theories, Sarah was determined to find out what her bedfellows truly were. She visited psychics, mediums, and paranormal investigators, hoping to get some answers. However, no one seemed to know anything about her bedfellows, and she was left feeling more lost and confused than ever before.\n\nDesperate for answers, Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands. She set up a camera in her room, hoping to capture the bedfellows on film. She stayed up night after night, waiting for their appearance. And finally, after weeks of waiting, she saw something that chilled her to the bone.\n\nThe footage showed her sleeping soundly in bed, when suddenly, the bedsheets began to move of their own accord. She watched in horror as the figure she had seen before slowly emerged from the shadows, its eyes fixed on her. It crept closer, its body contorting in unnatural ways, until it was mere inches from her face. And then, as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone, leaving Sarah shaking and sobbing.\n\nSarah showed the footage to everyone she could think of, but no one could explain what she had captured. Even her mother was understandably concerned. Her mother had never believed in the paranormal and found the idea of bedfellows frightening and unbelievable. However, upon seeing the footage, she couldn't deny that there was something strange and unsettling about it.\n\nSome believed it was a trick of the light, others that it was some sort of viral prank. But Sarah knew the truth. Her bedfellows were real, and they were after her.",

        "text": "Okay, wait, hear me out. \n\nAfter doing some digging, I’ve found a lot of suspicious evidence that leads me to this theory. But first, I need to give this little series I have here a solid update because this stuff is WILD.\n\nThat video I saw? It wasn’t an actual video. It was an advertisement. I spent some time on that forum (AFysica) and I found someone else -maybe the only other person on the planet- who had seen it (shoutout to Whit_474), and it turns out, it was linked to a website that was completely unsearchable. The website in question? The Kaiser Institute of Metaphysical and Biological Sciences. Now this website is SO weird. Like I said, it’s unsearchable. I tried. Wouldn’t come up on Google, Bing, even Ecosia, you name it. Impossible. I tried all the keywords and flipped through the pages of search results to the end and it just wasn’t there. So I’ll just walk you through it.\n\nThe “About Us” page is dated to 1976. The Institute describes itself as a ‘research university’, but doesn’t list the student population or any statistics at all on what they actually do. The only other things I could find on this place is literally a press release stating that 230 people did NOT bury themselves alive in 1979 - I’ll come back to that later- and a couple instructional videos describing life inside the Institute. These videos are absolutely useless because most of the recordings have been scrubbed and the transcripts have been redacted. One of them talks about some sort of guidebook or something. I’ve yet to find anything on that.\n\nThis morning I spent six hours straight researching. I haven’t been eating, or sleeping much, either. It’s too much. Something in me knows that I shouldn’t be so invested in this- it’s just, something about the way that it’s all set up, it feels like a mystery I’m meant to follow. Like I’m meant to theorize and pick out the little clues and get all invested. Especially since it’s so close to my hometown, and so obscure. But so captivating. Gives me chills.\n\nAll I have managed to figure out about the creation of the Institution itself is that it was founded by this girl named Linnet Kaiser. I couldn’t find much on her either, except that she published a book in 1968 called “Ethicae.” There’s a co-author on that too, named Tom Affo. (Sidenote: Affo? xAffo_gato? I’m willing to bet that whoever this was had figured this out too and was either a part of this or a really big fan of either ethics or affogato.)\n\nI could only find the introduction to this book; the other pages have been lost. But apparently, in this novel, Affo and Kaiser argue about whether it is safe or ethical to conduct experiments on uninformed participants if it is for the greater good of science. I don’t know what the outcome of this debate was, because the book is lost, but I can make a pretty good educated guess based on the very last piece of information I’ve found- this one is big.\n\nA newspaper clipping from September 1980 that reports on an incident from the previous year- a total of 230 people died from being buried alive, in a forest right outside of Ashpan, NC. This can NOT be a coincidence, right? Right outside of Ashpan- the same forest I recognized from the thumbnail of the first video. These have got to be related. They’ve just got to be. Also, get this. The whole forest caught fire in a ‘controlled burn gone wrong’ in October of ‘80. Yeah, that’s very likely. No, no. The timing is too convenient, and there’ve never been regular controlled burns like this recently or in the past, as far as I know.\n\nSo here is my current theory: Tom Affo and Linnet Kaiser co-founded the Institution as a sort of secret, semi-illegal operation to run experiments. What kind of experiments, I do not know. If they have anything to do with the Kaiser Phenomenon itself… I’m unsure. Part of me hopes so. Whatever they were, they culminated in the death of an estimated 230 people and this was just never brought up, ever. \n\nWhat I don’t get is why this never left Ashpan. How did something this scale just… never come up at a state or federal level? How did so many people lose their lives and no one noticed? The more I think about it the more my stomach churns. Are we even safe here? Were we ever safe here? And to think I could have gone my entire life without ever having known anything about this. Makes me shudder.\n\nAshpan City’s got a sketchy history with things like this. We have a college here, and a few very wealthy families (who I am not going to namedrop) who like to have things all neat and cut and polished. Our publicized crime rate is &lt;0.3%, but we all know that’s crap. We’re such a small town, though, that nothing can’t be covered up. Part of me hopes I’m on to something just so I can stick it to the mini oligarchy that tyrannically rule this little city like their perfect little playground. \n\nSorry, that was a bit of a rant. Completely unrelated. Anyways, wish me luck. I’m setting out next week to go check out the forest by my house and see if I can find any clues or anything. I’d go sooner, but there’s inclement weather. In the meantime, I’m going to see if I can figure anything else out about what the Institute actually did, or better yet, try to find that ever-so-elusive guidebook that the video mentioned. \n\nBest wishes in case something goes wrong. I'm extremely tired writing this right now. Who knows, maybe I am delusional and none of this is real or connected at all. Maybe I dropped out of school for nothing. I hope not, but one cannot discount the possibility.",

We’d been walking for nearly an hour, going deeper into the deep, dark, beautiful woods we had so often roamed. “You’ll see,” he responded with a light laugh, for it had been the tenth time I’d asked him. He always thought it was funny when I was impatient, and ornery.  “Why won’t you just tell me, Jordan?”  I grumbled\n “Because then it wouldn’t be a surprise, now would it?” I hated the fact that he was right, I hate it when someone is right and I’m wrong. \n“I guess…” he suddenly covered my eyes and led me forward before uncovering them, I gasped at the sight before my eyes. He started laughing when I ran around every corner of the old, wooden shack with peeling paint and rotting wood, and only laughed harder when I ran up and hugged him, accidentally knocking him to the  mossy, wet  ground. I absolutely adored the loud thundering laugh that came from deep within him “I found it a few weeks ago...I take it you like it?”  he asked “like it, I love it.” Just then a candle in the window lit up in a bluish glow, and I thought I saw a face in the window and jumped back with a startled squeak. “What is it?” he asked “D-do you see the f-face” I stammered “What face?” he replied.\nI felt something cold slowly seeping through my brand new, light blue jeans and it took me a moment to realize that I had fallen over and was sitting on the cold, slimy, wet root of a tree, only, it didn’t feel like a tree. It felt a little more like fired clay that had gotten wet. Was my mind playing tricks on me? Was I going crazy? It took me a couple minutes to realize that he was repeating my name “Megan?...Megan??!...MEGAN???!!!!!” he had shouted the last time “Huh? What?” he sighed in semi-relief “Are you okay?” “Y-Yeah….” I said “I think I’m just gonna head home” When I got home I went up to my room and laid in bed, almost instantly falling asleep. When I woke up the next afternoon, IT was there, sitting against my door, staring blankly at me. The face I saw in the shack, It belonged to a creepy porcelain doll. I immediately leaped up out of bed and ran downstairs. I ran outside and fell face first down the porch steps, immediately jumping back up again, sure, I had a bloody nose, but I didn’t care at the time. I just wanted to get away from the doll. So I ran out to the shack. IT was there. Is this doll guessing where I’m gonna go? How is it here? I could've sworn I saw it on my bed. The creepy doll face with cracks running down from its lower eyelids to its jaw. Its eyes were completely black. I started to back up, but every time I took a step back, it took two steps forward. When it came into the light I saw a torn, dark red dress made of what seemed to be velvet. I turned around and started running back, getting slapped in the face with branches. The only thing I could hear was a creepy  voice repeating the same thing over, and over again “I’m gonna get you…...”. I stumbled out of the woods and when I went looking for my friend she was  dead, one of her eyes was out of the socket, blood pouring out of the hole where it once was, it was dangling by a vein. Her mouth was wide open as if she was about to scream but was muted. I went out to the shack again, hoping the doll wasn’t there. It was. And so was Jordan, tied up and wounded. I screamed, and ducked when knives came flying at my face. The doll threw more knives when I tried to crawl to the door. I grabbed Jordan and ran out of that shack and didn’t stop running until I reached my house, I locked and bolted the doors shut, locked the windows and went into my room, locked the door and turned around. IT was there… watching me. Could it even see? How did it get in my room?Can it hear me? Am I losing my mind? Is this a dream?What the heck is going on? Gathering my things I jumped in my truck and drove away, never looking back. I would never return to that house again…..",

        "text": "When I turned 9 years old we moved across the state to a new home in a bigger city. My Dad had gotten a new job a few years prior and got the opportunity to make a lot more money at the new job. He was a salesman and the guy is a natural born talker. He made more money his first year on commissions than the two years prior at his previous job. He then bought a percentage of the company to secure a good income for years to come. When the opportunity to move to a new city with a bigger population which means more sales opportunities was presented, he immediately decided to make the move. My mother supported the decision and I, the only child, was impartial for the most part. The move seemed exciting and I figured I’d make new friends at my school and all would be well. We made the move and it was great. With my Dad making all this money we moved into a much much larger home than before. We never even looked through the whole attic, it was so big.\n\n The house featured a luxury kitchen on the first and second floor. 8 bedrooms even though there were three of us. The house was massive to say the least. I was given the opportunity to have the entire upstairs to myself, I would basically have my own home up there. I would have a house of my own at 9 years old, all the amenities were present on that second floor alone. I thought that was exciting until I started to get a look around upon arriving at the house. It was daunting how big it was. I felt all alone when my mom walked downstairs and I was up there alone. I decided to opt out of living upstairs alone and moved my stuff into the room closest to my parents. We lived in that house for 5 more years before I switched rooms upstairs. I was fourteen and I thought I was grown enough to live upstairs on my own, with all that space. We hardly went upstairs before I moved up there so it was pretty empty. But I had figured out how to shop online and convinced my mom to hook me up with all the basic fourteen year old necessities. We had bean bags, video games, a ping pong table, a pool table (even though we didn’t know how to play), a slurpee machine just like the ones at gas stations that I found on ebay. To say the least I had a sweet setup and very quickly became the house of choice for hangouts with my friends. \n\nThen at about 16-17 years old when most teenagers start experimenting my group of friends was no different. My parents had never had any trouble out of me at any point in my life, I mostly did all the same bad stuff as the other kids, I just never got caught and I can look anyone in the face and lie to them. So by the time I was 16 my parents very rarely came upstairs and when they did it was to tell me something important and that was not a common occurrence.  At 17 years old, four days after my birthday I had a group of 13 people including me in my upstairs. My parents knew people were over but had no clue who was there or not. The group was 7 boys and 6 girls. Everyone had told their parents they were staying at someone else's house so we were in the clear. No one there had ever smoked before so we lit a J and passed it around. It only went two rotations and every one there was super baked. It was a great experience and everyone had a good time. \n\nWe eventually put the joint out and decided to watch a movie with the lights on. I say it like that because when I flipped the light off it caused a grumble from a few people. So I flipped the lights back on and asked what the problem was. About half the group wanted to keep the lights on and they wouldn’t say why. When I nagged them a few times they admitted my upstairs was kinda creepy and they were super high and it scared them. I laughed at them and told them I was scared too when I was 9. But I relented and kept the lights on for the movie. We didn’t have it turned up very loud because we're all getting really quiet at this point. That is the first time it happened. We all heard a little thud and everyone in the group whipped their heads up to see if someone had stood up and made a noise or something but no one was standing. The group then went into panic mode and I made the suggestion to run to my room and we did immediately upon suggesting it. I had a pellet gun in there that looked like a real gun and a wooden katana, but it had some weight to it. Me and two of the other boys decided to get weapons and check the whole upstairs. It took us about fifteen minutes to declare it clear and everyone came into the TV area. A couple of people in the group wanted to go home but no one was going to drive impaired from my house late at night. I gave them the option to call their parents if they wanted to go home and they decided that was a bad idea. \n\nAbout a month after that incident I was upstairs alone and without a doubt in my mind I heard footsteps. So I looked up at the door waiting on my mom or dad to open it and they never came to the door and the footsteps stopped after three or four. I got up and checked around the upstairs and went downstairs and my mom was the only one home and I asked if she came upstairs and she said no. At that point I kinda freaked out and I told my mom about the footsteps and she seemed to take no interest in my display of emotion. She said I just thought I heard something, but I didn’t. \n\nAbout a week after that I got home from school and went upstairs and a light in the kitchen was turned on. I knew for sure that the light was off when I went to school that day so I again questioned my mom who told me she hadn’t been upstairs in a long time. Finally about a month after that the whole family went to another city three hours away to visit my grandparents for the weekend. When we got back and walked into our house instantly we could all tell something was up. The downstairs pantry door was open and that door is always, and I mean always closed. We never leave it open after going in for a snack and it was for sure not left open the whole weekend we were gone. My dad slowly approached the door when the worst jumpscare any of us had ever experienced quickly unfolded. A bearded skinny man in beat up clothes bolted straight out of the pantry directly into the middle of my dads chest knocking him onto the floor and the bearded man took one look at me and my mom who was screaming her head off and ran directly at the stairs and up the stairs out of sight. \n\nMy Dad jumped up to follow him but my mom yelled at him not to follow but instead get his pistol in case the man was dangerous. Me and my mom hurried outside to the street so we could see if he went out the window and my mom called the police. My dad got his pistol and joined us outside. The cops showed up in about seven minutes and entered the house. It took them an hour and a half to find the guy. Apparently there was another door leading into a room in the attic none of us had ever gone into. He had been staying up there for a few months and was arrested and charged with a couple different things. All in all one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me.",

        "text": "My sister died in late August. It wasn’t a good way to go. She was found in her apartment days afterwards, her body already swollen and putrefied, crawling with ants. I think I’ll see her bloated carcass for the rest of my life, waiting in the back of my mind to ambush me.\n\nI cycled through a few therapists afterwards. I pretended to be grieving and I pretended to listen to them and pretended to recover mostly until they lowered my dosage of Zoloft to a point where I could actually feel emotions again.\n\nStrangely, I never felt as sad as I thought I would’ve. I was just…numb. Neutral. It was sort of a gray fog in my chest where the crushing weight of my sorrow should’ve been. \n\nI should have realized what was happening long before it did. There was nothing normal about my lack of emotion, no form of processing, just blankness. I should have thought about it, wondered why I was so calm about the situation, and maybe then I wouldn’t have…\n\nWell. Let me start from the beginning.\n\n⸻\n\nThree weeks and a day since I walked in on Imogen’s rotting corpse, I went out for a walk at night. It was late, maybe ten or eleven, but not such a ridiculous hour that I was worried for my safety. I mean, my neighborhood is safe. It always was safe. \n\nRight?\n\nI had my earbuds in, listening to music but not really hearing it. Faintly, I could hear my shoes crunching over the asphalt of the road, slightly damp from the rain that had fallen early that afternoon.\n\nIt started with the background noise. Not things you’d notice unless you were hyper-tuned to the environment, which I was most decidedly not. The buzz of the streetlamps, the whispering of wind through the treetops, the distant barking of a dog a couple houses over.\n\nGone.\n\nThen this sharp tone rang straight from my earbuds. I flinched and ripped them out reflexively. My music had stopped, which was strange. I’d downloaded the playlist I was listening to, and besides, I wasn’t using WiFi.\n\nFrowning, I tucked my phone away and looked up, and that’s when I saw it.\n\nIt must have been eight or nine feet tall. Maybe even taller. It stood directly under the streetlamp in its washed-out amber glow, watching me with eyes glowing a pulsing, almost blinding white. It was half-bent over, its spine twisted at an impossible angle, one arm—or whatever you call limbs on something like that—dragging along the ground.\n\nIt looked like a shadow, but darker. A sort of blackness that seemed to pull in everything around it and drain the world of color. Like a hole in the universe.\n\nAnd there was something so disturbing about its vaguely humanoid shape that caused the first thought in my mind. It looked like something decidedly not human trying to force itself into a familiar shape, like it was wearing someone’s skin over its frame, concealing its true shape.\n\nMy whole body froze like a deer in headlights. I was filled with the horrifying feeling that I was teetering on the edge of an abyss, about to plunge into unfathomable darkness. \n\nIt didn’t move towards me. It watched me with those eyes, and then, in a jittering, blurry motion, it moved towards me.\n\nWithout a second thought, I turned and ran.\n\nMy heart pounded in my chest as I fled, filled with indescribable terror, the emotion of prey being pursued by a predator. Behind me, I thought I sensed it after me with that awful jerking gait, like it had to physically tear itself forward.\n\nI ran. I didn’t stop until I reached my house, until I slammed the door behind me and collapsed on the ground, my hand clamped over my mouth to stop the guttural sob that was trying to force its way out.\n\nI was shaking, dripping with sweat. The light from my living room window cast a glow over the floor the color of rotted squash.\n\nBefore it was cut off by a shadow tall and angular with warped limbs and a figure twisted like my sister’s broken body.\n\nI held absolutely still.\n\nFinally, I watched the shadow shrink and then disappear. I didn’t move for the rest of the night. I was frozen solid, like a block of ice.\n\n⸻\n\nI told my therapist about it, who suggested schizophrenia and scheduled me a screening with some specialist that I missed on purpose—the last thing I needed was to exist in that dulled state after my sister died, drugged into a fugue state by anti-psychotics.\n\nMy next few nights were spent sleepless, but it soon faded when nothing came for me. Nothing wanted me. I was safe, I was okay. It was my over-reactive imagination—or perhaps the trauma of seeing my sister’s deformed corpse on her bedroom floor, her hair a bloodstained halo framing her face.\n\nThe funeral was held a few weeks after that near my old neighborhood. I didn’t want to tend, but I felt a duty to my dad. He was so lonely after Mom died, and I hadn’t even called him or anything after Imogen died. I hadn’t been able to deal with seeing such raw misery in contrast to my total blankness.\n\nGoing back home was a strange feeling. It felt strange because my surroundings were wrought with nostalgia, but I didn’t really have any memories of the place. It was the oddest déjà vu I’ve ever experienced, since I had lived there since I was born.\n\nGod. Everything felt off that day.\n\nDad seemed to have aged a decade when he opened the door. His dark hair was streaked with a wide shock of gray, and his eyes seemed weathered, as if they’d seen too much. But when he smiled, I was reminded that this was the man who raised me, who tucked me in at night and helped me with my math homework and took me out for ice cream when I was cast as the lead in my school play.\n\n“It’s so good to see you, Rory,” he said, pulling me in for a hug.\n\nI felt something cold settle in my chest, but I didn’t say anything as he pulled me inside to a house that smelled like dust and childhood.\n\nIt was the last time I saw my father.\n\n⸻\n\nI got the call on the twenty-first. I ignored it because I thought it was some kind of scam. They left a message. “*We regret to inform you that at 7:33 this morning your father sadly passed…*”\n\nThat same day, I saw that creature again. And I should’ve realized what was happening, but I was so blind. I was so blind…\n\nI went over the autopsy report with the doctors. His neighbor saw the front door left open, and when she stepped on the threshold to close it, she saw his body slumped on the stairs. His throat had been brutally ripped out. He suffered severe internal hemorrhaging and multiple stab wounds, his skin soaked with his own blood. Based on the angle and positioning of the wounds, it seemed that he had committed suicide.\n\nI didn’t feel anything.\n\nI started to wonder if maybe something was wrong with me.\n\nThat night, I opened my window to get a breath of fresh air. I propped my elbows up on the sill and let my eyes skate over the surroundings: neighbors’ roofs, the tall pines across the street, the flickering lamp on the sidewalk—\n\nIt stood there. Watching me. Those vacant eyes fixated on me. Its body twisted, horribly contorted. \n\nEmotions flooded into me. Surprise. Terror. Curiosity.\n\nI jerked back, slammed the window, and hid under my covers like a little kid.\n\n⸻\n\nMy therapist advised against it, but I returned to work the next day. And it went…normally. No breakdowns, no distractibility. If anything, I was more focused than usual.\n\nBy the end of the month, my intense boredom and craving for intellectual stimulation had fueled me to offer to finish my coworkers’ assignments for them, which they gratefully accepted. My boss, shocked by my sudden increase in energy, gave me one pay raise, then another. When March rolled around, I had been promoted to supervisor of the department.\n\nIt was like I was hungry for something, and the harder I worked, the more I craved it. I didn’t know what I was searching for. But I wanted it, badly.\n\nOn the sixteenth, I was cleaning up after my shift had ended, fueled by an almost obsessive desire for cleanliness. Recently, my coworkers’ tendencies to leave their desks disorganized annoyed the hell out of me. I was so focused I didn’t even realize that Alice stayed behind.\n\nShe was a pretty girl with black hair and earth-colored eyes who was always kind to me, even if she preferred to talk than to focus on doing her job. She perched on her own desk and watched with curiosity as I scrubbed down one of the tables, scratching at a mysterious dirt mark until it finally rubbed away.\n\n“Hey, Rory,” she finally said after nearly four minutes of silence, which I counted in my head as I waited for her to leave.\n\n“Hi.”\n\n“Damn, you really want that clean, huh?” she asked playfully, slipping off the table and walking up behind me.\n\nI didn’t look up. “Uh-huh.”\n\nThere was another long pause.\n\n“Rory, are you gay?” she finally inquired after several painstakingly awkward seconds.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Uh…sorry. I just meant…”\n\nI paused from my aggressive wipedown to stare at her. She had dark skin, so I couldn’t exactly see her blushing, but there was a tinge of color on her cheekbones and a sort of chastised embarrassment in her eyes that she shyly averted from mine.\n\n“It’s just that Michael and Cole make jokes about it all the time, ever since you got your nails painted that one time. And I thought maybe there was a possibility…”\n\nI couldn’t help my scoff. “No, I’m not gay.”\n\nThe table was clean enough. I moved onto Alice’s desk, which regrettably had multiple tea rings next to her keyboard.\n\nShe was so quiet I thought she’d left at first. Then she blurted out, “Do you wanna go out sometime?”\n\n*That* took me by surprise. I turned around and stared at her, which in hindsight probably wasn’t the best decision—I wasn’t judging her, I was just caught unawares. She was staring very hard at the floor, refusing to look at me.\n\n“H-huh?”\n\n“I’m sorry!” she said guiltily. “I’ve sort of liked you for a while. You’re a really dedicated person, and—” She pressed her lips together and squeezed her eyes shut for a minute, as if pushing away an idea. “Never mind. Just forget I said anything.”\n\nShe turned and almost ran from the room. I gazed after her, trying to work through the sudden information she’d dumped on me and then abandoned me with.\n\nThat weekend, Alice was found in her room cut open from her throat to her waist, a pink mass of organs spilling out of the bloody slit, her carpet dyed scarlet.\n\n⸻\n\nAlice’s death was the turning point for me. The third death that I’d been close to. The third brutal extinction that I had been tied to. The third ending of a life that didn’t affect me in any way. No sadness, no regret, anger, shock, nothing.\n\nIt was then that I wanted to see the shadowy figure that I’d met twice.\n\nI was being haunted. That was the explanation that made the most sense to me. It had cursed me somehow. I was destined to see everyone who got close to me picked off as if they were names being crossed off a list.\n\nNews stories were flying everywhere. They had name the killer the Nightfall Butcher—a name that I thought suited whatever monster that had invaded my life just fine.\n\nBut this is the worst part: I wasn’t looking for the creature to end my suffering or to protect my loved ones. I was looking because I wanted to feel again.\n\nNumbness is pervasive as abject despair or constant rage. It’s a dull, pointless, never-ending purgatory. Neutrality drives you to behave more recklessly than any other emotion will. Any sociopath can attest to my words.\n\nI hadn’t experienced any emotions for what felt like decades. Just that relentless calm, like the glassy surface of a lake with no ripples. \n\nI needed it. I needed my emotions back. I needed to experience something, anything.\n\nAnd the last time that I had felt anything was the terror that speared through me when I met the eyes of that mangled shadow.\n\n⸻\n\nI stopped sleeping at night. My body was full of energy. I walked for hours up and down my street. One, two, three, four AM, until the sky pierced with the pale blue of coming dawn. I paced like a caged animal. I waited.\n\nSix days later, I saw it.\n\nI knew it was coming. I felt the way that the noise around me fell away, dying down to stillness. I turned the corner and there it was in the middle of the street.\n\nIt was taller now. Ridiculously so. A broken profile of my nightmares. A gaping maw in the universe. Its limbs were stretched to a comical extreme, arms folded on the ground, legs half-bent at impossible angles. Its neck was tilted so far that it had to face sideways to see me, its spine splintered into angles.\n\nIt felt like color had returned to my life. I was struck with fear, with surprise, but most of all a powerful wave of intrigue.\n\nIt watched me silently. Waiting.\n\nI stepped forwards towards it.\n\nIt was as if I’d snapped a string holding it back. The thing shivered towards me, extremities scraping against the road, twitching as if barely able to hold the weight of its malformed body.\n\nIt stood in front of me in a matter of milliseconds, towering over me, yet no shadow fell on me. Up close, it was even darker than I’d realized. It was almost hypnotizing to gaze at its form.\n\nAdrenaline pumped through my body. I was trembling with agitation, my palms were slick with sweat.\n\nBut god, it was so *freeing*. It was so *wonderful* to feel like this.\n\nI said, “What do you want from me? Why have you done this to me?”\n\nThe silhouette made a noise—I don’t know how, as its only discernible features were the eyes. But it was a guttural noise, not a growl or a groan, but the sound of grinding rock, of a city crumbling. It was the sound that a star makes second before it supernovas and obliterates entire galaxies.\n\n“You’ve killed Imogen. Dad. Alice. You’ve watched me. You’ve taken away everything. Why not just have me, if you want me so bad?”\n\nIts form snapped as it bent down slightly, trying to get closer to my face. It took every ounce of willpower to stop myself from flinching away.\n\n“Is that what you want? Do you want to kill me? I’m not going to run from you anymore.” I swallowed hard. “*I’m not scared of you*.”\n\nThe creature forced its misshapen legs to split downwards as it struggled into a sitting position. It reached towards me with an arm, which ended in three long, tapered fingers. Its eyes, bright as twin moons, stared into mine.\n\nAnd then I understood.\n\nI don’t know how. Maybe it was the look in its eyes, or some sixth sense, or a premonition (ridiculous, I know) jolting through my mind.\n\nI don’t know why, but I think it was—is—in love with me.\n\nAnd that knowledge, that burst of understanding, was what made me turn and run. What finally drew me out of my stupor and caused animalistic instinct to take hold of me. I sprinted back up the street, I ran for the safety of my house.\n\nI looked back exactly once before I disappeared inside.\n\nIt was gone. It hadn’t followed me.\n\nI was alone.\n\n⸻\n\nIt’s been almost two months since that incident. I’ve told my therapist about my lack of emotions, been prescribed medication and even more talk therapy, and taken a mental health leave from work. I stay at home. I don’t speak to anyone. I stay, and I try not to think about it.\n\nI’m writing this and posting this to the public so they know what happens to me if I disappear. If I give in and go back. \n\nI can’t stay like this anymore. I can’t live with this void. I feel inhuman, brain-dead, destroyed. I need to feel. I need to go back.\n\nI don’t know how much longer I can bear it.\n\nThis is the best way. Then no one will get hurt.\n\nRight?",

        "text": "There's this really weird thing I found recently that I've been meaning to share and explore a little bit, so here's a bit of backstory:\n\nI came across this unsettling YouTube video the other day on my recommended. It was titled \"KR Noise\" and the thumbnail was just this overexposed photo of a forest- these blackened birch trees against a bright white sky and sharpness turned so high up that I couldn't actually tell what it was until now, thinking back on it. I watched the video and it was potentially the WEIRDEST thing I've ever seen in my life. I clicked on it thinking it was like brown noise or white noise or something to help me focus on homework, but it wasn't, it was this narration of some abstract physical theory about timelines and 'jumping' or something, with a very strange ink-animated diagram explaining it... I don't actually remember what the theory was about, it was kinda complicated. I was trying to follow along, because I found it interesting, but it was not really making sense. Watching it, I felt… unsafe. Like, not just creeped out, but targeted. Specifically. Like I was being watched, or spoken to directly through the screen.\n\nBut here's the even weirder part. I can't find the video anywhere. \n\nI looked it up this morning, but there was no trace of it anywhere on the internet at all. Not on YouTube, and it wasn't uploaded on to any other sites either.\n\n I did find, though, a reference to it somewhere, on a forum called AFysica. A user called xAffo_gato made a post about something called the Kaiser Phenomenon, and it sounded extremely similar to what was being described in the video (I think the video was uploaded by a channel by the name of the Kaiser Institute? Kaiser Institution? Something like that). \n\nI asked them about the video, and they said that they had seen it before, but that it'd been taken down years and years ago, in 2011. Which is weird, considering I definitely saw it last Monday. I think it was Monday.\n\nBut I asked them anyway, and they broke the theory down into fundamental parts. It's mainly about these timelines, called 'channels,' which are referred to as the 'vector' channel and the 'sub-scalar' channel. And they're connected, or something. You can only be in one at a time, and in order to get to a 'sub-scalar' channel, you had to 'jump' from the main 'vector' timeline. And it was completely random when you did that, and impossible to determine when it would happen.\n\nThere's also an extremely rare but non-zero case that someone can get stuck in-between the main vector and sub-scalar timelines, and in that case their existence is like, superimposed on top of the scalar timeline. I KNOW this doesn't make sense. I might be relaying this wrong, I don't know, it honestly doesn't really make sense to me either, but anyway.\n\nI tried asking xAffo_gato about the video itself and the channel it was on, but I never got a response. Since this whole interaction, I've been feeling really strange. Like, chills down my spine, can't sleep kind of strange. I don't know what it means, but if anything, I'm just going to keep looking. This feels too weird to just ignore and move on with my life. I feel like there is more to be found here, like, WAY more.\n\nOh. And I figured out why the video was so strange to me. I know the woods in the thumbnail, because I live near them. I was out walking this morning and it dawned on me. It's in Ashpan City, North Carolina (ironic name, considering Ashpan is much less a city and much more a rural hellscape of the greatest proportions). And I am a little freaked out because of this, considering my city's… extensive… history with sketchy shit. I'm going to do some more research and see what I can find, hopefully it'll be interesting.\n\nDown the rabbit hole we go.",

        "text": "  \n\nMy wife went missing for three days.\n\nI filed a missing persons report with the Leatherwood Police Department. On the fourth day, I got a call from Sherriff Stewart. \n\n“Jason… I..”\n\n“What is it Sherriff? “\n\n“She’s dead. I’m sorry, so sorry.”\n\nI broke down, my body shaking, my sadness uncontrollable. \n\n“Do I need to identify the body.”\n\n“No..No. We don’t need to do that. Just, you know, do you need anything? I mean if you do need anything, let me know.”\n\nBy her own wishes, my wife was cremated. I put the urn in our bedroom on top of my dresser. I wasn’t too keen on having a shrine for her. It didn’t feel right to be so ostentatious. A spot in the bedroom was just fine. \n\nThe Sherriff told me that she had written a suicide note. She had explained that she was dealing with a deep depression that she couldn’t escape. Darkness had enveloped her life. There was nothing in there about me. The Sheriff made it seem like an icy matter-of-fact account of how and why she wanted to end her life. She drove to Nashville, got a hotel, and shot herself in the head. \n\n“Can I have the note?”\n\n“No, Jason. It’s evidence.”\n\nA month passed. It was November. Snow had blanketed everything on the farm. There was a full moon in the sky and the snow radiated a pale blue, invoking in me a melancholy mysticism. I could feel my wife’s presence. We owned the land across the street. There was an old broken-down barn with dark stained wood. It was leaning on one side, almost ready to fall. I hadn’t any plans for it. I liked the way it looked with the surrounding trees and the open field. It was a perfect setting. I put a picnic table and a grill over near the barn. We spent a lot of time in that spot. It was our sacred ground. \n\nI was lost in memory, the sort of memory you have when someone you love dies and you don’t want to face your new reality, the reality of loneliness. I wanted to be dead. I wished for it. I even thought that maybe I would drive up to Nashville myself and end it the way she did. And then I noticed a figure walk out from behind the barn. It stopped and stood still. I took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes. The snowy moon must have rattled my hysterical mind, creating a specter of imagination. It moved again, but only two more steps forward. I froze. I was trying to understand what I was seeing and how to react. I reasoned that my grief had taken over my faculties, that what I was seeing was impossible. It looked like my wife, for when that shadow walked, and even though it was only a few steps, the gait was unmistakably my wife’s. She had a slight limp from an accident she had as a child. It had been a terrible ordeal and a long recovery. She had severely damaged her lower leg. He father had lived but her mother had died. \n\nThe figure eventually walked through a dilapidated wall and disappeared into the barn. I ran upstairs to get my flashlight out of the bedroom closet. I was about to run out of the room but then stopped. Fear had gotten a hold of me. If that was my wife, then who was in the urn. If my wife was in the urn, then who was in my barn. I turned off the lamp on my nightstand and stood there in the dark ruminating about what to do. I was looking through the window staring at the barn. I had almost convinced myself that I hadn’t seen anything, but then I saw her come back out of the barn, turn, and stare back up at the house. I teared up. It was definitely her. Did the Sheriff lie to me, and if so, why? She walked back into the barn. \n\nI made up my mind. I had to do it. I had to go and see for myself. I was angry at myself. What a coward. That’s your wife and she needs help. \n\nI ran downstairs and out the door. My pace never slowed. I forced myself to get there as quick as possible so I wouldn’t have time to change my mind.  I crossed the street, almost slipping on the ice, got to the grass and heard the crunch of snow beneath my boot. I decided to slow down at that point, so as not to make any startling noises. I slowly approached the open side wall and shined my flashlight inside. \n\nStanding there in the middle of the barn was my wife. She was wearing a pink blouse and a white skirt. Her skin was pale and dry. She was barefooted with dirt all over her feet. I could see runes tattooed all over her body. Her blouse was unbuttoned, and her breasts were exposed. The middle of her chest was cut open and I could see her still beating heart.  \n\n“Michelle. Oh Michelle.”\n\nShe just stood there. No response, but she did look straight at me, and in a subtle way acknowledged that she recognized me. It was an ever so slight a smile that only a husband would recognize. That melted me. I felt guilty because before that I had a brief thought to go and grab the pick axe that was laying against the stable and plunge it in her head, ending her misery. I decided that I could fix this. She was hurt but not dead. \n\n“Come on Michelle. Let’s go in the house.” She tilted her head and started to step toward me. I put my arm around her. She felt stiff and cold, like she had been locked in a freezer. We made our way across the street and into the house. I couldn’t stand to look at her chest any longer. The skin had been peeled back at four corners and sewn to her skin. The sternum, along with some ribs had been removed. The remaining ribs fortified with metal and welded together. I buttoned up her shirt. The thought of that pickaxe crept back into my head. \n\nI got her upstairs. It was an arduous climb. She could barely bend her knees and each step seemed to exhaust her. I laid her on her side of the bed. Her nightstand was stacked high with books. Michelle never just read one book at a time. She would always read three at a time- one fiction, one history, and one true crime. I put a cover over her and went downstairs to grab a beer and think. \n\nI drank more beers than I probably should have but a part of me did not want to go back upstairs. The beer was to knock down my anxiety and give me courage. I went back upstairs. Michelle hadn’t moved. She was lying on her back and staring at the ceiling. I could hear her labored breathing. She looked horrible. That damn pickaxe. I keep seeing it. It keeps jumping in my head. I didn’t even know if I should turn out the light. I decided I would go turn on the lamp on the nightstand and then come back and turn off the main light. I wasn’t going to sleep in the bed. I grabbed a cover from the closet and got as comfortable as I could in the chair. I stared at a Michelle for a good while, trying to figure out if she was really her anymore. After a while the beer took effect and I fell asleep, despite my fear. \n\nI dreamed of a woman dying on the side of the road, wheezing for air. \n\n“I can’t breathe. Here.” She handed me a pickaxe and then just laid there wheezing and gasping. I kept hearing her gasp. It took over my dream. Every other aspect of the dream faded, but her breathing grew louder. I finally realized that it was Michelle and I had somehow incorporated her breathing into my dream. I opened my eyes to see what was happening. \n\nMichelle was floating in the air directly in front of my chair. She was about three feet from the ground, her head turned up to the ceiling, feet close together, and arms spread out as if she was being crucified. Her blouse was open again. She stopped wheezing and started growling. She looked down from the ceiling and directly at me. Her eyes were all white with no pupils. \n\n“I love you honey. Let’s go to the barn.” She started laughing.\n\nI jumped out of the chair and grabbed the doorknob. She raked my back with her fingernails trying to grab my shirt. I felt the sting of exposed cut skin. I elbowed her in the face. She lost her grip. I ran out the door, jumped down the stairs, maybe touching one or two and out the front door. I stumbled to the street and saw that Sherriff Stewart’s squad car was coming up the road. \n\nHe stopped the car. The headlights flashed off. \n\n“Jason, everything alright. What are you doing?”\n\n“Sherriff, I don’t know what’s going on.”\n\nThe Sherriff drew his gun and shot me in the leg. I fell to the ground in agony. He walked over and shoved his hand in my face and pushed my head hard into the snow. My ears and face burned with the extreme cold of the packed snow. He shot me in my other leg, then turned me over and handcuffed me. \n\n“It’s nothing personal Jason. She belongs to the Temple now.”\n\n“What in the hell are you talking about!! Stop! Don’t take me in there.”\n\nHe had started dragging me by my feet towards the house. I could see on his hand Michelle’s wedding band. My legs ached with excruciating pain, but I did everything I could to kick at him. He got furious and turned me over. He grabbed the cuff chain, pulling my arms as far as he could towards my head and started dragging me that way. It felt as if my triceps and tendons were tearing away from the bones. I screamed in agony. \n\n“She has to have her first kill to finish the ritual and who better than you. I dropped her off at the barn. I was hoping she would finish you off there, but we don’t always get our way. These demons are a little unpredictable.”\n\nHe got me to the porch and pulled out his gun. \n\n“Here sit up.” He helped me to sit up and pointed the gun at me. “Now, here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to put you in that house and Michelle is going to kill you. See, you need murdered blood to complete the possession.”\n\n“You have her ring,” I mumbled to myself. \n\n“Ah yes. I shouldn’t tell you all this but hell, why not. You’re about to be dead. You see we must have something personal to control her. She is basically a slave to the Temple. She is possessed by a lower-level demon I guess you could say. It’s really just an animistic spirit. Strong but dumb as shit. Not really cerebral, if you know what I mean, but coupled with a human body it will do anything we ask. It is strong and loyal if controlled by the personal mind of a deceased human and of course, that human spirt is attached to this ring, or personal token. It's like vodka and orange juice. A murderous spirit watered down by a lovely soul. “\n\n“You killed my wife. You lied to me.”\n\n“No, the Temple killed your wife. I’m just covering it up and helping to finish the ritual. Enough chit-chat. Let’s get to it. Really, Jason, I liked you. It wasn’t my decision. I would have chosen a different couple.”\n\nHe put the gun to my head and commanded me not to resist. He helped me stand up. We walked through the door, and he shoved me to the couch. \n\n“Michelle, honey, come on down. Daddy’s home.”\n\nShe had been standing at the top of the stairs. She came down the stairs but much more agile than when I had taken her up the stairs. As she came down the stairs she looked toward me with a murderous smile, her eyes still white as snow. She was growling and laughing, enjoying the prospect of ripping me head off. \n\n“Michelle, it’s me Jason, you’re husband. I love you.”\n\nI hadn’t noticed before but one of the cuffs were loose. In the mayhem he hadn’t pushed the strand all the way into the lock. I started to pull my hand through and felt it come free. I kept my hand behind my back. Michelle was coming down the stairs. The Sherriff was mesmerized by my wife’s entrance, and more irritating, I think he was somewhat aroused by her. I rushed forward, grabbed his hand with the gun and forced it to his face. I didn’t try to take his gun but pulled the trigger while it was still in his hand. I didn’t get to aim the gun exactly where I wanted but the bullet ripped through the side of his neck. Blood shot out of his neck and into my face. He struggled and my hand slipped back in front of the barrel of the gun. He pulled the trigger out of desperation and shot through the palm of my hand. He tried to yell to Michelle, but his voice was muted by the blood brimming in his mouth. I tugged at the gun with my other hand, and it fell to the ground. Sherriff Stewart fell back against the living room wall clutching at his throat. \n\nMichelle jumped on my back. She clawed at my eyes. The room fell out of focus with a tint of red filling my eye. With my one good eye I could see the gun on the ground. She now bit into by shoulder and at the same time started to slap me in the face with her open hand. She seemed to be getting stronger the more she wrestled with me. A thought occurred to me that it was the blood, the blood was making her stronger. I tried to elbow her again, but she dodged it. She wasn’t falling for that again. I fell to my knees and crawled on all fours to the gun. I grabbed the gun and shot behind me. She fell back off of me and to the floor. I turned around to see that I had grazed her shoulder. She got up and I shot again. This time in her chest, right through the heart. It kept beating, with blood pumping out onto the floor. I rushed over to the Sherriff and started to get her wedding ring off his finger. She came back towards me, growling and hissing. I struggled to get the ring. The Sherriff grabbed my arm but finally the ring came free, and it was mine. \n\nMichelle stopped her advance. She stood up and looked forward. I noticed her appearance was getting worse. Her teeth were sharp. There was blood all over her body, from her chin to her legs. It was my blood. I was feeling weak. I probably looked just as bad. I had no strength to do any more fighting. I had been bitten, slapped, and shot three times. I knew how I could end this. First, the Sherriff. I wasn’t sure how she would transform, but I was pissed. \n\n“Michelle, kill that lousy son of a bitch. Finish off Sherriff Stewart.”\n\nMichelle obeyed without hesitation. She ran to him and started to bite and claw, ripping flesh with her teeth and with both hands dug her nails deep into his cheeks. Then she pulled his cheeks away from his face. His eyes were wide with fear, but he couldn’t audibly express it. From where I was sitting, I could see his teeth through the hole in his cheek. Then she ended it with a quick snap of his head.  \n\nI put Michelle’s ring on my finger. \n\n“Go to the barn.”\n\nMichelle walked out to the barn and went inside. I watched her from the front door. I went into the kitchen and got a beer. I sat there at the kitchen table for a long time. On the refrigerator was a picture of me and Michelle. We were in the Smokey Mountains at Clingman’s Dome. It was a great trip. I proposed to her there in the mountains. Who was that in the barn? Was that Michelle? How was I supposed to proceed. I sat there for an hour. I made up my mind. \n\nI walked out to the barn. It was morning by now- no need for a flashlight. The sun was rising. She was obedient. She stood patiently waiting on my next command. I walked over and grabbed the pickaxe. \n\n“Lay down.” She laid down. \n\n“I love you.” I looked at her ring on my hand. I hesitated. Maybe it could still work. I thought about the picture on the refrigerator. I raised the axe over my head and plunged it into her heart. I kept at it until her heart stopped beating. I didn’t stare at anything other than that beating lump of muscle. Finally, it stopped. Her pupils appeared and she gave me that ever so slight smile that only a husband could see, closed her eyes and died.",

        "text": "It started at the beginning of the best part of my life. Me and Mary had gotten married at the young age of 25 and 24 respectively, and thanks to my parent's riches, neither of us will ever have to work a day in our lives. So, on our honeymoon, we said \"fuck it\" and decided that the sooner we had kids, the better. But after about a week of trying, something went wrong.\n\n\"Jesus! My legs hurt like hell...\" said Mary, startling me awake at 3AM.\n\n\"Huh...? Oh. I'm sure it's just a cramp.\" With that, I fell back to sleep. But even when I awoke, I saw her staring at the ceiling, eyes bloodshot, legs twitching. She was clearly in pain. This time, my well-rested and reasonable mind deduced that something was clearly wrong, so I lifted away the covers and took a look at her thighs. To my shock, they seemed a bit thicker than they were the day before. Along with that, pronounced yellow veins protruded from her skin. There was no mistaking it, she had some sort of disease. Based on the... interaction we'd been having for the last week or so, I wondered if it was an STD of some kind. No. I was a faithful husband, that simply wasn't possible. I reached out and touched her legs, trying to soothe her, but she only screamed in pain as my fingers made contact. That was it, I was calling a doctor.\n\n\"Gemini Island Resort front desk speaking, how may we help you?\"\n\n\"My wife is having very severe leg pain, and I think we need a doctor sent up here.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't have a physician here capable of treating any kind of serious issue, although we can call the mainland hospital if you would like.\"\n\nSo after about an hour of sitting through Mary's grunting and groaning, a doctor came and took a look. \n\n\"I've never seen anything quite like this.\" He said, not exactly awestruck, but certainly curious.\n\n\"It appears her condition is worsening rapidly, I'm very sorry, but we're gonna need to take her to the hospital on the mainland.\"\n\nAnd so they did. She was loaded onto a helicopter, and they asked if I wanted to come. One part of me wanted to stay for the rest of our planned time at the resort and wait for her to recover and return, but the other part of me knew that recovery was going to take a very long time...\n\nSo I flew with them. I rented a nice beach house for myself, then took a trip to the hospital so I could see Mary again. It was there that I met the same doctor from earlier. Something was different. He still looked professional and had a look of intrigue on his face, but there was a subtle horror behind his eyes.\n\n\"Hi. I'm Marc Williams, Mary's main Doctor for as long as she stays here.\" He said, extending his hand. I shook it. Marc lead me into Mary's room, where her legs sat exposed, hooked up to all kinds of strange equipment. The legs were just a bit larger, and the veins were just a tab bulgier. The Disease had clearly slown down to a more forging pace, but it was certainly not stopping. Marc, seeing my disappointed expression, started talking. \n\n\"We've been doing everything we can, and the progression of whatever this is has been drastically reduced. It'll take weeks just to spread a little bit.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" I chimed in. \"You don't know what it is?\"\n\n\"Nope, we haven't been able to match it with any official ailment, and blood samples aren't telling us anything either.\"\n\nHe had a familiar look on his face. A look that I remember using a lot back in school. Strangely, it was the same indecisive look I wore when I thought I had the answer to a question, but it seemed too crazy to be true...\n\n\"John?\"\n\n\"It's me, Mary. I'm here.\"\n\n\"It hurts so much.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll live.\" I had uttered that same phrase when we first met. I was 17, and I was out on a hike, when I found her. She tripped on a rock in a particularly brutal fashion and broken her femur. If it hadn't been for me, she would've died of thirst, unable to move, desperately crying for help. I had said those words to comfort her as I carried her along the trail, until I eventually reached my car, and drove her to the hospital.\n\nShe chuckled, and we talked, reminiscing about the good days of our past 8 years together.  Yet under our cheerful conversation, there was a dark undertone. I was scared if those memories would be the last ones we would ever make together.\n\nIt got worse as time went on. Days turned to weeks, weeks turned to months. Her twin sister came down, and I let her stay at the house. We never really talked much, but I knew she loved Mary just as much I did, which was enough to have my respect. So every day, we would drive down to the hospital and spend a couple hours with Mary. Each day, you could see the change in her leg size. It disturbed us, and Mary knew it. But we just tried our best to ignore it.\n\nBut the passage of time didn't just have a profound effect on Mary, it had one on the doctors too. I never really considered what they had to go through, constantly having to treat and stabilize a completely unknown mystery illness. Each time Marc gave us another hollow piece of \"good news\", his warm smile agreed with what he was saying, but his distressed eyes did not.\n\nBy the 5th month, Mary's legs weren't just swollen. They were MASSIVE. It was most certainly not normal, and it was getting increasingly hard to be in the room with her while ignoring it. They had become so thick in fact, that the doctors said that from this point on, it wouldn't be possible to amputate them as a last resort. By the 6th month, there was a putrid smell emitting from the legs. It was clear that the doctors tried to mask it with all manner of sanitary products, but nothing worked.\n\nBy the 7th month, I had to stop visiting every day, and changed my visits to weekly. It felt like the smell was eroding away at my nose. Also, puss began oozing out of her legs. There was no clear source... it was just there. And by the 8th month... there was something moving. You could see the massive slabs of fat bend as something moved around inside of the legs. It seemed like each leg had one massive, bulgy, parasite squirming around inside of it. It was at that point I truly began to wonder if my sweet Mary was going to die...\n\nDuring the 9th month, the true horror started. Her legs seemed like they were somehow collapsing into themselves. Perhaps... contracting? The Legs basically became half as large in about a week. But whatever those things were continued to squirm and writhe. Then, at the end of the 9th month, it all went to hell. I was sitting next to Mary. She wasn't talking anymore. The pain had just been too much. And then she screamed. It wasn't a normal scream, it was something entirely different.\n\nIt was as if she was playing a video game and \"unlocked\" a new sound. It was unlike anything I'd ever heard before. It wasn't even scary- it was so alien that it didn't trigger the normal programmed stress reaction that we all have to hearing other humans suffer. As I was transfixed by this strange sound, Marc and his team burst into the room. As a nurse escorted me out, I heard Marc say:\n\n\"It seems I was correct. It's time for the procedure.\"\n\nWith that, I waited outside in the hospital waiting room, hoping for the best. After what felt like hours, the screaming stopped. The Nurse opened the door, beckoning me inside. As I entered, I was shocked. There lied Mary, on the bed. Her Heart rate was fine, but there were bandaged stumps where her legs had been. Marc was there, and he looked at me with his signature warm smile, though, like all the doctors and nurses, his eyes were basically dead. \n\n\"Shortly after you were escorted out, her legs contracted enough that we were able to apply enough pressure to instantaneously amputate them. Luckily enough, we were able to stop the bleeding in time. She's expected to make a full recovery, and, with your budget, you should be able to get her some good prosthetics.\" After he paused, I noticed that he had two bundles in his arm. Baby bundles. Was he saving my wife and delivering two different babies at the same time? Wait. No. He had never left the room. And when I looked into the warm, blue eyes of those babies, I saw mine staring back. And on them still, were the same flecks of puss that used to cover Mary's legs. Marc noticed me staring.\n\n\"Heh, I almost forgot. Congrats on the Twins!\"",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a man named James who lived in a world that he thought was real. He had a wife and children, a job, and a comfortable life. But one day, he stumbled upon a theory that suggested that everything he knew, everything he had ever experienced, was just a simulation.\n\nAt first, James thought it was just another internet conspiracy theory, but as he delved deeper, he began to uncover evidence that seemed to support the idea that his reality was just a virtual construct. The laws of physics were behaving in ways that couldn't be explained, and strange glitches and errors started to appear in his world.\n\nEventually, James discovered a hidden message buried deep in the code of the simulation. The message revealed that the beings who created the simulation were watching over it, observing and studying the simulated civilizations for their own purposes. These beings were from another dimension, and they had the power to manipulate reality itself.\n\nJames was horrified by this discovery, and he realized that his entire life, his memories, and his loved ones were just part of a massive experiment. He felt like a lab rat, trapped in a cage and being observed. He also realized that his death in the simulation would mean nothing, as the beings would simply delete his consciousness and create another.\n\nDesperate to break free, James started to look for a way out of the simulation. He spent hours poring over the code, searching for any weaknesses or loopholes that he could exploit. But the beings who created the simulation were too powerful, and they quickly discovered his attempts to escape.\n\nAs punishment, the beings trapped James in a never-ending loop. He would live the same day over and over again, experiencing the same events and the same conversations, with no hope of escape. The loop was designed to be a living nightmare, a personal hell for James to endure for all eternity.\n\nBut James was not alone in his suffering. He soon realized that there were others trapped in the loop, just like him. They were all prisoners, unable to escape the grasp of the beings who created the simulation. They were all part of the experiment, just like James, and they were all doomed to suffer in their own personal hells.\n\nThe beings who created the simulation continued to watch over it, observing and studying the simulated civilizations, waiting for the next experiment to begin. And we, too, may be just part of their experiment, living our lives in a virtual world that we believe to be real. Our memories, our thoughts, our experiences may all be just part of a larger, more sinister experiment.\n\nBut there is something even more terrifying about the loop. It is not just a simulation, it is also a prediction. The beings who created the simulation can see the future, and they use the loop to predict the outcome of their experiments. They manipulate reality to create the desired outcome, and then they watch as the simulated civilizations play out their predetermined fate.\n\nSo, are we living in a simulation? Is our reality just a virtual construct, created and controlled by beings from another dimension? Is our fate already predetermined, and are we just playing out a script that has already been written? The truth is, we may never know. All we can do is keep living our lives, hoping that we are not just part of a larger experiment, hoping that our reality is real. But the fear of the loop will always be there, lurking in the back of our minds, reminding us that we may be living in a nightmare that we can never escape.",

        "text": "It's been haunting me for years, and I still can't wrap my head around what happened. I don't know what I saw or what I experienced, but it was something I'll never forget.\n\nIt all started when I was hiking in the woods by myself. I was an avid hiker and loved being in nature, so I was always up for a challenge. I had been to the woods several times before, and I was always fascinated by the beauty and peacefulness of the area. But this time, things took a turn for the worst.\n\nAs I was walking, I heard a strange noise coming from the bushes. I thought it was just an animal, so I continued on my path. But the noise only got louder, and soon I saw something moving in the bushes. I was scared, but I was also curious, so I approached the bushes to see what was there.\n\nThat's when I saw her. She was a woman, but not like any woman I've ever seen before. Her skin was pale, her eyes were black, and her hair was tangled and matted. She was wearing a long, tattered dress and she was just standing there, staring at me.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I was frozen with fear, and I couldn't move. That's when she started to move towards me. She was walking slowly, but she was getting closer and closer. I was so scared that I just turned and ran as fast as I could. I ran and ran until I finally found my way out of the woods.\n\nI never went back to that place again, but I can't forget what I saw. I don't know what that woman was, but I know she was something evil. Something I never want to see again.\n\nOver the years, I tried to shake the memory of that woman and what happened in the woods. I tried to tell myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but deep down I knew that wasn't the case. I knew what I saw was real, and I knew that woman was not human.\n\nI started to research and try to find out more about what I saw in the woods. I read books on folklore and legends, and I even went to a psychic to see if she could help me understand what happened. But no one had any answers for me.\n\nIt wasn't until I met a man who had a similar experience that I finally got some answers. He told me about a local legend of a woman who was said to haunt the woods. The legend said that she was once a beautiful woman who lived in the area, but she was betrayed by the man she loved and left to die in the woods. It was said that her ghost still haunts the area to this day, seeking revenge on anyone who enters the woods.\n\nI finally understood what I saw in the woods. I had encountered the ghost of the woman in the legend. And even though I knew what she was, the memory of that encounter still haunts me to this day.\n\nSometimes, when I'm lying in bed at night, I can still hear that strange noise. And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can see her pale face and those black eyes. I know she's still out there, waiting for me to come back. And I know that I'll never be able to shake this memory.\n\nI still love hiking and being in nature, but I never go back to that place in the woods. I don't know what I would do if I ever saw that woman again. All I know is that I never want to experience",

And they found me they know I've been watching them, they know I've been researching them, studying them, Now they are doing the same to me they are watching me i can feel them, i can see them in the shadowy corners of my hallways and my bedroom, they study the way i act, they know i can see them and i know they can see me, some nights they wander the halls, does anyone else in the area i live in also here the creaks? the laughter? the sound and feeling of heavy, laboured breathing on their neck every single time they try and go to sleep? Its become natural all of these noises and feelings, but they are never ever spotted when the snow is gone, i call them snow lurkers. i have grown to adapt to the late night laughter, it just tells me more for my studies i have a whole journal full of entries about them i'll write a few of my favourite entries:**\n\n**September 10th 2021-**\n\n**its in the corner of my room, laughing at me i cant see its body but its face looks deformed, like a zombie with a birth deformity ,it has white teeth, with a gooey red substance dripping off of them not blood something else, like guts.....? oh my god its guts, it coming closer i'm going to stop looking, i fell it's breath on my neck i'm going to focus on my phone for now. its gone...?**\n\n**November 28th 2021-**\n\n**it's snowing i'm scared, they are back, i have seen 2 so far, there are usually 7 so this has been quite a calm day, wait there is the other one damn-it i'm just gonna keep seeing these things all the time aren't i?**\n\n**December 19th 2021-**\n\n**it's not snowing but i hear the laughter no one is here though.

Although he  never went into detail about these creatures, there are 8 i have names for them i call one the giggler, this one is the one that laughs and looks deformed like a zombie but its face is young like a toddlers face, but it's got around 100 teeth, Another is one that wasn't written in the transcription i call it the screamer it's got long hair no eyes and screams all night long, i have not slept in 1 week 6 days 5 hours and 37 seconds because of it,the tall one i call him long lurker he is 25 feet tall and his neck is bent out of shape completely he has no eyes so i don't actually know how he can see me but he can and he can see me so often that as i'm typing this into reddit i hear him behind me i'm acting unfased but he knows i feel him he knows i'm scared.

        "text": "I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was only 10 years old at the time, and my family had just moved into a new house. It was a big old Victorian-style house with high ceilings, wooden paneling, and large rooms. My parents had bought it for a great price because the previous owner had left in a hurry, and no one knew why. But my parents thought it was a great opportunity, and my siblings and I were excited about our new home.\n\nOne day, as I was exploring the house, I came across a staircase that led to the attic. It was a narrow, wooden staircase, and it creaked with every step. I was curious, so I decided to take a look. As I climbed up the stairs, I noticed that the light in the attic was on, even though no one was supposed to be up there.\n\nI reached the top of the stairs and peered into the attic. It was a large, open space with a slanted ceiling. The light was coming from a single bulb hanging from the center of the ceiling. I stepped into the attic and looked around. There were boxes stacked along the walls, and old furniture covered with sheets. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust.\n\nAs I walked through the attic, I suddenly heard a creaking sound. I stopped and listened. The sound was coming from behind me. I turned around and saw that the staircase was closing, the wooden panels folding in on themselves like a book. I was trapped in the attic.\n\nI started to panic. I tried to push against the panels, but they wouldn't budge. I was trapped, and I didn't know what to do. Then I heard a voice whisper my name. I froze. I looked around, but no one was there. The voice whispered my name again, and I realized it was coming from one of the boxes stacked against the wall.\n\nI walked over to the box and opened it. Inside, I found an old diary. I opened it, and the first page read, \"This is the diary of Sarah.\" I realized that the voice was coming from the diary. I started to read, and the words on the page were describing what was happening to me in real-time. I couldn't believe it.\n\nAs I read on, I learned that Sarah was the previous owner of the house. She had been trapped in the attic for years, and no one knew she was there. She had been writing in her diary, and the words I was reading were her last words. She had died in the attic, and her ghost was now haunting me.\n\nI tried to run, but I couldn't move. The ghost of Sarah had me in her grasp, and I was trapped in the attic with her. I was there for hours, reading her diary and hearing her voice whisper my name. And then, as suddenly as it had started, it was over. The staircase opened, and I was able to escape.\n\nI never went back to the attic. I told my parents what had happened, but they didn't believe me. They thought I was making it up, trying to get attention. But I know what I experienced was real. And to this day, I still have nightmares about that staircase and the ghost of Sarah who was trapped there.",

        "text": "Hello, strangers. I'm back from the half-dead. Jacek was kind enough to post the last time, and even though I haven't had the balls to read it yet, I'm very grateful. I'm just not ready to learn more about Jeremy yet. \n\nOur family is so fucked up, isn't it?\n\nI had a talk with my Dad. A very unpleasant one. Jacek had tied him to a chair down in the basement and gagged him, and he was still sitting there, staring ahead with steely malice in his eyes when the miller, my brother and I made our way down the stairs to him. Jacek stepped forward and removed the rolled up piece of wool he'd stuffed down my father's throat. \n\n\"Gross, you got my sock all wet,\" he commented, unrolling the saliva-drenched article of clothing before tossing it aside. \"Ah, was time I washed it anyway.\"\n\n\"Son of a bitch,\" Dad spat, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Hey come on, don't drag my mom into this. So, I think your kids got some questions for you?\" He motioned for us to step forward. \"I'm just here to help them out in case you're gonna try and be stubborn.”\n\n\"You're Hettmann's boy,\" Maxwell muttered. \"Your father was just as much of a bastard as you.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Jacek said, not batting an eye. \n\n\"Stop it, Dad. Just tell me what your game is and we won't have to hurt you. Seeing as being civil is obviously not an option with you.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of you,\" my father growled back.\n\n\"Your second-born thought that, too,\" Jacek answered. \"Hour later, I had him wishing he was just a twitch in your nuts again. Just letting you know considering you're putting forth a challenge here.\"\n\nIt seemed to take my father all of his willpower to pull himself together—he squared his shoulders, inhaling deeply and then sagged back in his chair, eyes closed. Despite his reluctance, he spoke. \"When I was a young man, I used to talk to an angel,\" he said in a low, brittle voice. \"He told me what I would become. A modern knight of faith. Started when I was in my teens and lasted all the way up until I moved here with Ania. He never came to visit me in these woods. Unholy ground. No matter how hard I tried to reach out to him afterwards, he simply wouldn't show. Sometimes, I'd get far away to contact him. I'd drive for hours, but he never came back, even when I had my mind screaming for him. This place took everything from me that made me special. I would have become a great man, and your freakshow robbed me of that.\"\n\n\"Then why the fuck did you marry Mom in the first place?\" I snapped.\n\n\"Because of you.\" A thin, sardonic smile tugged on his lips. \"Hadn't planned for Fiona *fucking* Novak. The princess. You were an accident. Just one slip-up and there I was, stuck with you. Had to play Baby Daddy in the middle of a haunted forest. A shotgun wedding is what it was. Your grandparents would have hunted me down if I hadn't made an honest woman of your mother.\"\n\n\"And that’s my fault?\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing, bewilderment turning my voice shrill and squeaky. \"You *knocked up* a girl and then decided to be a dick about having to step up? And I'm to blame for you not keeping it in your pants?\"\n\n\"Great knight of faith you are,\" Casimir snorted. \"Can't even put a condom on right.\"\n\nI threw him a sidelong glance. \"Now that’s ironic.\"\n\n\"Hey shut up, I'm trying to support you here.\"\n\n“Right, I’m sorry.”\n\nMaxwell regarded us with scornful eyes. \"I can't believe you two are my children. Casimir, you just had to throw your life away, too, didn't you? Follow your sister into this hellhole… Ain't no holy light reaching you here, son. If you wind up here, that's it for you. You're lost. Just like Ania, just like Fiona. You're gonna die because you came here, and it's not going to be a peaceful, dignified death.\"\n\nCas flinched visibly, but collected himself almost right away. There was something in his eyes, though, something that hadn’t been there before.\n\n\"Cas? Do you—\" I began, but he cut me off.\n\n\"Later, Fi.\"\n\nHeart pounding, I turned back to my father. \"So. You hate me, you hate the woods, you hated mom—\"\n\n\"I didn't hate your mother. She was a misguided little thing. She needed me. Felt good to be needed. But she pushed away any good sense I tried to instill in her.\"\n\n\"Ania never needed you for shit,\" Jacek remarked. Throwing me an apologetic look, he added, \"Sorry for butting in, gorgeous, but this pissstain is talking out of his ass. I knew Ania. She was like my godmom or something. He didn't let her see me for a long time, but we were close enough.\" Returning his attention to Maxwell, he continued, \"She didn't need anyone. Yes, she was a cold woman from what I've heard, and not always fair, but damn if she wasn't independent. 'S what *my* old man used to say about her, too. Can't judge her as a mother, but I know she always held her own.\"\n\n\"My wife is none of your business, kid,\" Maxwell grunted.\n\n\"Kid? For fuck's sake, I'm pushing forty. You'll just say anything you can to justify not listening to anyone else, won't you?\" Jacek gave a bitter laugh. \n\n\"Not to filth like you. Only clever thing my daughter ever did was reject you.\"\n\n\"So you knew about us?\" I asked incredulously.\n\n\"I'm not stupid, Fiona. Only Ania never allowed me to confront you. Besides, when one day you stop sneaking out and suddenly start wearing wedding gowns, demonic magic is a sound conclusion.\" \n\nI took a deep breath. \"Okay, hold it. All that good stuff aside, *why* would you try and take me out after all these years? If this is about the Evening Redness, why get it now? Did you only learn of it recently? And how did you find out; who told you?\"\n\nA beatific smile suddenly bloomed on my father's face. \"The angel came back to me. He told me to find the sleeper, and to offer it to him. The world can then finally submit to order.\"\n\n“Say, what’d he look like? Your angel?” Jacek chimed in, a strange, meaningful undertone in his voice.\n\nDad let out a soft, near reverent sigh. “He’s the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen. He’s all in white; he’s… not old, but not wholly youthful. His hair is like fresh-fallen snow, and his eyes… his eyes hold the wisdom of centuries.”\n\nSomething about this response seemed to take the miller aback. “But he had, like, a human form? He looked like a guy?”\n\nMy father nodded, still gazing emptily into the distance.\n\nI cleared my throat. \"Why didn't they want it before? I mean, seeing as God's all-knowing, the angels must have been aware of the Evening Redness.\"\n\n\"They didn't need it. But now, there's a power struggle going on. It's not just chaos against order anymore. A bunch of other wannabe deities are trying to make a comeback, out there looking for acolytes,\" Maxwell explained impatiently.\n\nI threw Jacek a brief glance. He had gone very quiet beside me. \"That much is true,\" he hurried to confirm. \"Nick is concerned about it as well. It took him some effort to rise to power. It's not just anyone who can decide over the fate of human souls. He doesn't want to lose his position.\"\n\n\"So what's new? Who's trying to topple the existing forces?\"\n\n\"Oh, a bunch of guys. I hear Loki is back. Doing considerably well for himself, the old fox. May be a serious contender.\" The miller shrugged, brows furrowed despite the lightness of his tone.\n\n\"Not with the sleeper in the Lord's hands,\" Maxwell gritted out.\n\n\"Or in Nick's,\" Jacek added. \"But I'll admit that I've no idea how such a great shift in power would translate to our lives. I don't want the forest to be wiped out, much as I like the idea of eternal darkness and a world in sin.\"\n\n\"I need to protect my land,\" I told him. \"I can't have anything happening to the forest people. I know they're safe with things the way they are, so I need it to stay this way. Nobody is getting the sleeper.\" I tilted my head at my former lover ever so slightly, and he mirrored the movement. \"Is that okay with you? Can you accept that?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah, of course I can. I'm not gonna work against you,\" he said softly.\n\n\"Fiona, you don't know what you're doing,\" Dad pressed out, sounding like he could barely contain himself. \"Give the sleeper to *me*!\"\n\nI ignored the demand, locking eyes with him in what I hoped came off as an indifferent, cold stare. \"My soul. For how long have you had it?\"\n\n\"When the angel reappeared, I asked him about it. He told me how to find it, how to trap it. He assured me it would work on the Evening Redness as well.\"\n\nI sincerely doubted one could simply trap a being of this power and size. It wasn't the same as a little white rabbit. \"My head hurts,\" I muttered. \"Let's take this upstairs, boys. I need a break.\"\n\nWe left Maxwell down in the basement. Casimir and I sat down on the living room couch while Jacek went out onto the porch for a smoke. \n\n\"So… down there,\" I began with a nervous chuckle.\n\nMy brother was staring at the black, silent tv screen, avoiding my gaze. I scooted closer to him, one of my arms snaking around his midriff. \"I got that wrong, right? You meant, like, we all have to die sometime, right?\" \n\nHe didn't respond. The tip of his tongue moved to moisten his dry lips. \n\n\"Casimir, I'm reading too much into that, aren't I?\" I asked, trying to mask the desperation creeping into my voice. \n\n\"Remember how I talked to Jacek alone, before he first left after coming back?\" he finally spoke.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Wanted him to stay. Still need him to stay. You gotta have someone. Just in case.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Oh come on, Fi. You know, don't you?\" He turned to face me. His eyes were glistening. \"Look. I'm not gonna drop dead *tomorrow* or anything. I'm taking my meds, and I'm gonna live just as long as you. I'm… sick. But it's not a death sentence. I can go on for a long time. If I watch myself, I'll be fine. Well, not *fine* fine. It's not gonna be the same again, ever. But all things considered, I—I’ve got hope. This whole cynical thing, that's just the fear. I haven't gotten over that yet.\"\n\nI swallowed hard. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Can we… not? Name it? I don't feel like I can talk about it that way yet. So… clinical. I dunno.\" He grimaced, looking distinctly uneasy. \"Whenever I think about it, I'm constantly switching between jumping into a panic or downplaying it entirely, and like, neither of those are good. I suppose I'm just really, really confused. I know I'll be okay eventually, but right now, I don't want to think about it until I've reached a point where I can deal with it level-headedly. That's why I came here, I guess.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I said slowly. \"And… physically, how do you feel?\"\n\n\"Normal. The first couple weeks were like a really long flu, that's… that's why I went to get checked in the first place. Now, I've mostly recovered. I'm still a little more fatigued, though. Not as energetic anymore, but that could also be the stress. Got nightsweats occasionally, but not like I used to.\"\n\nI reached up to massage my temples. \"Okay. Okay, so if—if you need something, anything, don't ever hesitate to ask. And please take care of yourself. Don't overdo it. I've literally no medical knowledge but the second you start feeling off, let me know.\" Noticing how frantic I sounded, I willed my heart to stop racing. \"Casimir, I love you more than anything else in this world. When you're ready to talk more, I'll be here.\"\n\nCas looked up to meet my gaze, wiping the corners of his eyes with his thumb. \"I know.”\n\nI got up, patting down my white tulle skirt. \"I really don’t wanna go now, but I need to deal with the sleeper.\"\n\n\"Course, the eldritch horror in our backyard.” Cas snorted. \n\n\"I've got an idea. It's a reach, but maybe it'll get me places. Could you stay here, watch Dad?\"\n\n\"Sure. And I know I don't need to tell you, but… be careful.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nOut on the porch, the air was chilly and fresh. Icicles had formed on the edge of the roof, hanging down like blades gleaming in the cold sunlight. Jacek was leaning against one of the wooden pillars, cigarette in mouth. His arm stretched up, he was fingering the tip of the icicle right above his head, and I was momentarily distracted by the view of this shirt riding up beneath his open jacket. His eyes flicked down to me, and he dropped his hand, smiling sheepishly.\n\n\"So, you… talked to Cas?\" he inquired.\n\n\"M-hm. He’d already hinted at something there before. Still, it's… you know.\" It was harder to speak against the lump in my throat. \n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Imma try and focus for now. Evening Redness. That sleeping thing. I think I wanna try and talk to it.\"\n\nJacek frowned. \"I'd tell you that sounds dangerous as fuck, but I'm sure you're well aware.\"\n\n\"Acutely aware. I think I'll ask the Bannik for help again. I know it didn't go well the last time, but now that I'm actively looking to contact the sleeper, I reckon it's exactly what I need.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Want me to—?\"\n\n\"Want to come with?\" I asked at the same time.\n\nHettmann grinned. \"Definitely.\"\n\nWe started marching up to the sauna, falling into step beside one another. His shoulder kept brushing against mine, but neither of us moved aside. \"Where were you?\" I asked, breaking the silence. \"Nick. What’d he do to you?\"\n\n\"He locked me into one of my apartments. I was grounded, basically. No cell phone service, no internet. He made it feel like it lasted a whole month. It's easy dishing out shitty punishments when you can literally create pocket dimensions in which time and space works the way you want.\"\n\n\"Fuck. That sounds awful.\"\n\n\"It's not the first time he's hurt me. Or imprisoned me. He's done worse to others. Not always a breeze dealing with the guy, but I'm used to it.\" He shrugged.\n\n\"Are you mad at me?\"\n\n\"What? No!\" He let out a perplexed snort of laughter. \"Why would I be? I-I'm not like that anymore, I've dealt with my anger issues.\"\n\nI swallowed thickly. \"For what it's worth, I really regret not telling you about my missing soul back when we were… you know. If I had… I mean, we could have talked it out, right? And you would have sent Licorice after it for me.\"\n\n\"Guess so.\"\n\n\"Wish I'd trusted you.\"\n\n\"Wish I hadn't pressured you. Got that from my father, I think. In hindsight, my folks were kinda fucked up as well.\"\n\n\"You wanna talk about that sometime?\" I offered.\n\n\"I'd be glad to. When this is all over. But for now, I really don't want to steal your focus. We have more important things to do right now,\" he reminded me, voice gentle and perhaps a touch wistful. \n\nI agreed, albeit with a heavy heart. Knocking on the door of the sauna, we waited, exchanging an awkward smile in silence. When the old spirit answered, I told him about my idea. Disappointingly, he seemed rather uneasy about it.\n\n*\"Seeing as you nearly shook the entity awake the last time, that does sound like an awful plan,\"* he gibbered.\n\n\"But I need to communicate with it somehow. And if it stays asleep, that's not going to happen. I have to… I don't know, negotiate with it or warn it or something.\"\n\n\"The Devil will come for it soon. If Fiona doesn't rouse the sleeper, then *he* will. He wants to consume it, which is most likely going to give him power over these woods. You don’t want that,\" Jacek added gravely.\n\nThe Bannik shook his head. *\"I'm satisfied with my current warden.\"* He threw me a benevolent smile. *\"And I've no doubt that once the Beast is in power, he would devour the rest of us as well. Either that or enslave us. Both prospects are equally unpleasant to me. I see why you'd want this, heiress. But I fear I truly cannot help you. This is no matter of clairvoyance or divination. What happened before was an accident.\"*\n\n\"It worked, though! Just let me stick my head in that bucket again and bring Arkadiusz' spirit out!\" I paused. Another weird sentence to say aloud. \"Doesn't matter if it wasn't the intended effect the first time.\"\n\n*\"You're aware that it still can and will make you lose your mind if you aren't careful?\"*\n\n\"I guess. I just need to—\"\n\n*\"I may have a better idea. Do you remember when you came to the sauna some nights ago? There was a lady here; a red-haired fairy. Find her, and she will give you what you need. She sells concoctions that allow communication on different planes of existence.\"*\n\nI rubbed my head in thought. \"Huh.\" I didn't doubt it. The woman had indeed kind of given me drug dealer vibes. \"Fair enough. Where can I find her?\" \n\n*\"That might be a touch problematic. I will of course let her know that you are looking for her, but I do not know when she will come to visit me again. It may be a few days 'til I next see her.\"*\n\nMy shoulders sagged. \"But I need to talk to her as soon as possible!\"\n\n*\"I know not the fairies usual haunts. This is all I can do for you. But fear not, her visits have always been quite frequent.\"*\n\nI palmed my forehead. \"Okay, well, please, please tell her it's urgent. Thank you for everything.\"\n\nOn that rather frustrating note, we parted ways. We spent some time searching the woods for any sign of the folk, but our efforts remained unrewarded. Eventually, we gave up and turned in for the night. I asked Jacek if there was any way he could delay the coming of Nick, but he was understandably uncertain. \n\n\"Best to just hope he has something else on his plate at the moment. If I bring you up again, he might end up doing the exact opposite; drop by early out of pure spite.\"\n\nI got that, and thus settled on waiting back home. It was all we could think to do. It was weird, though, sitting in the living room together with Cas napping on the couch beside us. Part of me wanted to talk about Jacek and myself in a “where do we go from here?”-kind of way; but that was a conversation I truly did not want to rush. Like he’d said, with everything going on, it truly would be more sensible to wait. We chatted about some lighter stuff, and then ended up turning on the television. There was a rerun of an old horror movie which we tuned into. I hadn't taken the time to really get into a movie for a while, so I didn't recognize it until Jacek spoke up.\n\n\"That's Eight Legged Freaks.\"\n\nI let out a quiet laugh. \"Holy shit, you're right! We watched that together, remember?\"\n\n\"I remember you being squeamish,\" he teased, scooting a little closer to me. \n\n\"I was *not*!\" I pointedly turned my head away. \n\n\"You were! You were making all those little noises, like a guinea pig. It was adorable.\" He gave me a smug grin. \"Ain't no shame it it. I'm just saying; I can't believe that with everything you've always had going on around you, you still got scared from a *comedy*.\" \n\n\"A *horror* comedy,\" I corrected. \"With spiders.\"\n\nHe laughed out loud, only stifling it when his eyes briefly fell on the sleeping form of my brother. \"Fiona Novak. Seduces forest monsters but gets scared of spiders on tv.\" His voice had lost its mocking edge, suddenly sounding warm and deeply sentimental. His gaze kept flickering to and away from me, his fingers nimbly pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket only to play with it in his lap. \n\n\"Try: Jacek Hettmann; works for the Devil but can't look me in the eyes without turning scarlet,\" I returned, moving closer to him. \n\n\"Yeah, well.\" He exhaled shakily, hands stilling. \"Harsh. True. I do not know how to come back from that.\"\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\nHe smiled, tentatively raising his arm and slowly inching it into my direction.\n\n\"It's okay, you can hug me,\" I encouraged with a smirk. \n\n\"Oh, you're just gonna make fun of me, aren't you?\" he grunted, arm coming closer. \n\n\"Always. Go on, do it. Just bring it in.\"\n\nHe groaned, snatching me by the shoulders and quickly but gently pulling me to his chest. I pressed my nose into the crook of his neck before sinking down to rest my head in his lap, leaning against his belly. \"Damn, but you are smug about this,\" he muttered fondly.\n\n\"Count on it.\" I was actually beginning to relax a little bit when a blood-curdling scream rang out from the basement. \n\nI sat up so quickly that I accidentally bumped the top of my head against Jacek’s chin. Cas jerked up from his pillow, blinking and wiping drool from the corner of his mouth. For a second, we all merely stared at one another in shock. Then, we sprang to our feet, rushing for the stairway to the basement just as another cry erupted from behind the door. I grabbed the handle, ready to tear it open, only to find that it wouldn’t budge. \n\n“It’s jammed!” I yelled out, jiggling at it in desperation. \n\n“Don’t think so!” Jacek shouted, pressing himself up to the door as I stepped aside. “Open up!” he barked. “I know you’re down there! Open the fuck up!”\n\n“We tied Dad up though,” Casimir supplied.\n\n“I’m not talking to *him*,” he muttered curtly as he started banging against the wood with both fists and raised his voice again. “Open the damn door! Open it! Don’t you fucking dare—!” He kicked the frame in sheer frustration. “Fuck!”\n\nThe noises grew louder and more unsettling. I thought I could hear the chair falling over as my father’s screams turned increasingly desperate. His voice was all gurgly and weird, but he seemed to be begging for forgiveness. Not mercy, *forgiveness.* “I’m sorry!” he kept on wailing, over and over again. “I did what I could, I swear I tried—!”\n\nMy heart was pounding like a sledgehammer. “Dad?” I bellowed, spittle flying from my mouth. “DAD!” I tried the door handle again, shaking it furiously. \n\nAnother cry of agony. Then, everything fell silent. The door suddenly gave in to my demanding tugs and I staggered back as it swung open. The three of us descended the stairs in a hurry, Cas hastily flicking on the lightswitch. The bulb that came fizzling to life revealed a gruesome sight. My father, still tied to the chair that was lying on the floor on its side, had fallen limp. Blood had pooled beneath his body, the source of which being a hole in his stomach that was leaking red everywhere, soaking his shirt and freely running down. As my gaze traveled up his broken frame, it stopped once more at his throat. It was wide open. There’s no other way to describe it. It hadn’t been slit or cut; it had been *torn out*. \n\nI doubled over and threw up. A bit of my vomit dripped into and mixed with the puddle of blood. I couldn’t look away, despite it making me feel dizzy. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Casimir cover his face with his palms, knees trembling but not quite buckling, like he was fighting it. Jacek was grimacing, his mouth moving as though he was saying *something*, probably cursing, but I couldn’t hear a word. There was this ringing in my ears, like I’d stood too close to a gun being fired. I swayed on my feet, then caught myself.\n\n*Don’t pass out.*\n\n*For fuck’s sake, do not pass out again.*\n\nI looked over at my brother to see him walking towards me with his arms outstretched, almost in slow motion at first, before suddenly being upon me in a heartbeat, wrapping his whole body around me. \n\n*We’re okay.*\n\n*We’re staying awake.*\n\n*Yeah.*\n\n*No matter how often we’re gonna be beaten unconscious, how much sick shit we have to see, we’re gonna bounce back.*\n\n*It’ll be okay.*\n\nI held onto my brother like my life depended on it, feeling like I could hear his pulse thrushing. He pulled back only to lock eyes with me, then cupped my cheeks on either side and pushed my forehead up to his, *hard*. When we eventually parted, we were breathing heavily, my own teary expression reflected in his. \n\n“Let’s cry about this later,” Cas breathed, voice cracking. “When we’ve got the time.”\n\nI nodded emphatically. “Okay.” Wiping the wetness from my puffy cheeks, I rolled my lips together, squaring my shoulders. \n\nCas cracked his neck and knuckles, stretching his arms. “I feel like doing some yoga right now, just to wind down, you know.” Filling the air with words, terrified of silence.\n\n“You two… Shit, I am so sorry,” Jacek began, voice faltering. “I don’t know what to say.”\n\n“We wouldn’t have let him live anyway, would we?” my brother wondered aloud, tone soft and pensive. \n\n“I’m not sure,” I replied haltingly. “I don’t think so.”\n\n“What the hell happened here? You know something, don’t you?” Cas asked the dark miller who had folded his hands on the back of his neck, looking at the basement ceiling with a lost, shaken expression. His entire body was tense and cramped, muscles straining against the sleeves of his black shirt. \n\n“I thought I knew,” he pressed out. “Guess I was right. I fucked up; I should have told you as soon as I suspected, but I didn’t—I thought I’d just deal with it on my own, I didn’t want you to lose focus, I didn’t wanna put more on your plate… I cannot fucking believe this…” He took a few deep breaths, steadying himself. “Damn, Fiona. I’m so, so sorry.”\n\n“So tell me now,” I prompted gently.\n\n“The being that used to come and talk to your father… That wasn’t an angel.”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part

        "text": "My name is Ethan and I live in a world of darkness. \n\nI don't know how old I am. \n\nI call myself Ethan, but that's the oldest name I can remember. I've been called many names since then because every time I fall asleep, I get transported to a new reality, a new life, with a new family, friends, and identity. It's been happening for as long as I can remember and it's a never-ending cycle of horror and loneliness.   \n\nAt first, I think I am just dreaming, but as the years go by, it becomes clear that there's something more sinister at play. Every time I close my eyes and drift to sleep, I wake up in a new reality and I am always the only one who remembers my previous lives. I'm a prisoner in my own mind, trapped in a cycle of endless horror and detachment.  \n\nOne morning, I wake up as a man in his mid-thirties, living in a small town in rural America. I have a wife, two kids, and a job as a mechanic. It feels like home, but as soon as I close my eyes and drift to sleep, I get transported to another reality. This time, I am a young woman living in a bustling city in Asia. I wake up on a battlefield in Ukraine, part of a group doing unspeakable acts. Every time I wake up in a new life, I feel like I am living a stranger's life.   \n\nI struggle to maintain any sense of self because I am constantly losing my memories and identity. The cycle continues and I become more and more detached until I feel like I am nothing more than a ghost, haunting the lives of others. How can I love them, be there for them? I am there as long as I can stay awake, then I'm gone. Who takes my place? \n\nAs I've lived through countless lives, I've tried to find some answers, some explanation for what is happening to me, but no one ever seems to remember me or even believe my story. I can't remember if I've been more good or bad. I have wonderful memories. I have memories I wish I didn't.\n\nI feel alone, lost, and scared. \n\nEvery time I try to talk to someone, they think I am crazy or delusional. I'm filled with pain and heartache. I am always leaving behind people I love and I never know if I will see them again in another life. But the cycle will go on and I will wake up in another reality and the process will repeat itself.   \n\nThe one thing I have never tried is to die. I have always gone to sleep. I am always afraid of what might happen if I don't wake up again. But now, I am at the end of my rope. I can't keep living like this, constantly losing everything and everyone I have ever loved. I have come to realize that there is no escape from this cycle unless I end it myself. \n\nSo, I have made the decision to try and break the cycle. \n\nI am going to die tonight. I don't know if it will work, but I have hope.",

        "text": " Chapter 1\n\nEven now it’s hard to say exactly when it happened. I suppose drinking enough alcohol will do that to you, though. It was around a week ago when I finally decided to break out of my shell. I’ve been studying at this university for about three months and doing only what was required in order to pass my classes. I didn’t talk to anyone outside of class besides the occasional “hi,” or “hey,” that I would say to my roommate. It was safe to say that I was something of an outcast, but that would change on the first night of the fourth month; my birthday.\n\nThe day passed as it ever did. I went to class as usual, ate lunch, went to my final classes of the day and then went back to my dorm with a honeybun in my hand that I would serve to myself as a birthday cake. I dropped my backpack next to the minifridge and got into bed. I sat criss cross eating the honeybun in silence, thinking about how miserable my life was. Eventually I became so depressed that I dropped the snack to the ground and curled up in my blanket. I went to sleep only to wake up an hour later. I checked the clock and saw that it was midnight exactly. \n\nI planned on going right back to sleep but after attempting and failing to swallow, I got up and went to get a drink. I opened the fridge and moved my roommates cans of beer out of the way to get to my water bottles. I opened it and drank the whole thing in one go. I dropped the bottle on the ground and was about to close the fridge when I saw my backpack, or more specifically what was in it. In the water bottle pocket on the side of my backpack was what appeared to be a folded up piece of green construction paper.\n\nI grabbed it out of the pocket and checked the front to see the words “Happy Birthday.” Written in big, colorful, bubble-style letters. I brought the letter over to my desk and turned the lamp on. I turned the paper around and peeled off the tape that was holding it closed and unfolded it. \n\n“Dear, Dustin,” The note read. “Happy birthday! You were very nice in class for letting me borrow your pen. You know how the professor hates it when students show up unprepared. The Knuckle Dusters are hosting a party at their house later tonight. We can hang out if you want. Anyway, thank you for the pen! From, Jess.”\n\nI couldn’t believe it. It was actually happening. A girl has actually taken interest in me. Should I go? I haven’t been to a normal party in a long time, let alone a frat party. I checked the time again; 12:05. Could the party have ended already? No way, those parties last until sunrise. What if I go and I don’t have a good time? What if I go and make Jess uncomfortable? I glanced at the can of bud light in the fridge and made a judgment call. I grabbed the can, cracked it open and downed the thing in one swig before bursting through the door and running down the hall. \n\nThat was the last thing I remembered before waking up lying face down in turf. My head was pounding like something was trying to get out and my stomach ached like I had taken a cannon ball to it. I rolled onto my back and winced at the slight amount of sunlight that made it past the field goal that I was lying beneath. It was then that I realized that I had been sleeping in the football field all night. I began to push myself upwards but stopped and fell back down to the ground when I felt the pain emanating from my right hand. I looked down at it and saw that the knuckle for my middle finger was completely fucked up. I mean my finger still worked but the skin of my knuckle was almost black in complexion. The skin was cracked revealing red meat beneath. It almost looked… burnt. I felt the skin but the skin didn't feel back. It was dead. \n\nIt felt exactly like what you’d think burnt flesh would feel like. Hard, coarse, like dry, crackled dirt. It was then that I remembered that I had been to a party the night before. I couldn’t remember anything during but I remembered the walk there. Maybe I drank a bunch of alcohol while I was there and blacked out, accidentally putting my hand on an open flame? That’s a possibility. The burn was beginning to hurt badly so I stood up using my left hand for support this time. Once I was completely upright I leaned against the goalpost for a moment to regain my bearings as well as trying not to vomit. Once I thought I was ready I turned and took a few steps towards the school before bending over and throwing up onto the field. \n\n/// /// ///\n\nOnce I made my way inside I slowly walked down the hall towards the nurses office. Surprisingly the pain in my hand was beginning to subside but the aching in my head had increased tenfold. I decided to go to the cafeteria and get a coffee instead. I bought the coffee and made my way to my first class of the day, making sure to keep my right hand inside my pocket so that no one could see. As I walked down the hall I turned down a corner and instantly bumped into Jess. She looked annoyed at first but once she realized it was me she smiled slightly. \n\n“Hey, Dustin.” She looked me up and down. “You look…”\n\n“Tired.” I finished for her. \n\n“I guess that was some party, huh? Sorry again for walking out like that. I was just annoyed.”\n\nI tried my hardest to figure out what she could be talking about but I was drawing a blank. Instead I just nodded and said “Yep.”\n\n“Oh!” she blurted out. “I almost forgot.” She took her backpack off and knelt on the ground, looking through it. When she found what she was looking for she stood up and held it out for me to take. “Your pen. I should have put it in with the note but I guess I didn’t think about it.”\n\nIt was just a standard Bic pen. To be honest I didn’t really care that much about it but the gesture was still very pleasant. So pleasant, in fact, that I completely forgot about keeping my right hand hidden. Out of pure reflex I took my hand out of my pocket and took the pen in it. She looked down and gasped as she noticed my torched knuckle.\n\n“Oh my god.” She said as she grabbed my hand and inspected it closely. “What did you do?”\n\n“I, uh… I really don’t know.”\n\nShe looked me in the eye and I noticed that her previously calm expression was replaced with one that was the opposite of calm. “I thought you said you weren’t gonna do it.” \n\n“Do what?”\n\n“Join the Knuckle Dusters.”\n\nI pointed at my wound. “That's what this means?”\n\nShe let go of my hand abruptly and turned away. Tossing a “Don’t even talk to me anymore,” over her shoulder.\n\nI watched as she walked away, and when she went around another corner I lowered my head and stared down at my burnt knuckle. What the hell was so bad about this fraternity that Jess would refuse to talk to me? \n\n/// /// ///\n\nI angrily banged my fist on the door to the Knuckle Dusters’ house, recoiling in pain realizing that I should have knocked with my left hand instead. \n\nWhen the door opened I was greeted by a six and a half foot tall giant. “Hey! Dusty’s back!” He yelled before extending out a fist toward me. “Gimme some knucks, dog.” \n\nI noticed that both his middle and index knuckles were burnt as well. When I took too long to do what he wanted he grabbed my right hand and fistbumped it for me. The pain from the contact with my burn wasn’t nearly as bad as the pain from being punched directly in the fist by some idiot who didn’t know his own strength. \n\n“Ow!” I yelled. “What the hell, man?”\n\n“Oh, my bad, bro. Your burn probably hasn’t had enough time to heal.”\n\nI flexed my finger muscles to make sure they still worked right. “Which brings me to the reason why I came here in the first place.”\n\nAt this point multiple other frat members showed up at the door, surprised and happy to see me. \n\n“Ay, it’s Justin.” another member said. \n\n“Yeah, hi.” I raised my fist to show them my burnt knuckle. “Look I just came here because I wanted to know what-” Before I could finish my sentence one of them went in for a fistbump, hitting me directly on the middle knuckle. “Fuck!” I yelled, causing everyone there to burst into laughter.\n\nSuddenly their laughter ceased. They moved out of the way to create room for who I assumed was their leader. He was tall. Not as tall as the first guy I talked to but still very much taller than me. He stood out like a sore thumb, wearing a matching dark maroon two piece suit. He walked with authority and none of his constituents dared to look him in the eye. I noticed that all five of his knuckles were burnt to a crisp. I guess the hierarchy of this fraternity was based entirely on how many times you’re willing to mutilate your hands.\n\nHe made it to the door and stood there for a moment, staring down his nose at me. I stared back, not saying a word. This went on for at least twenty seconds before he spoke.\n\n“So this is the newest recruit?” He said to no one in particular. \n\n“Yes, sir.” One of the members said from behind him. “His name is Justin. He was at the party yesterday.”\n\n“Ah, yes.” He said with a smile, noticeably reminiscing over the night before. He snapped himself out of it and cleared his throat. “I’m Harry, the president of this fraternity.” \n\nHe raised his hand for me to shake and I did just that. Only that wasn’t at all what he wanted. When I felt what didn’t feel at all like an open hand at all in my palm, I looked down to see that he had held his fist for me to bump instead. So far this was a terrible first impression.\n\n/// /// ///\n\nHarry’s private room was big and semicircular. One side of the room was lined with bookshelves while the other half there was a big wooden desk with a painting of an unfamiliar old man hanging on the wall behind it. The plaque below probably had the name of the man but I couldn’t bother to read it.\n\nHarry gestured for me to take a seat opposite of him, which I did. He flopped into his big desk chair in a most ungraceful manner, slouching and letting out a loud breath as if he was a father that just returned from working a twelve hour shift. “So,” He started. “What brings you to our humble abode?”\n\n*Finally*, I thought. *Time for some answers.*\n\n“I was just wondering what this was all about.” I pointed at my burnt knuckle.\n\n“Oh that? It’s a sign that you passed the test. The initiation.”\n\nI truly had zero idea what he was talking about. How many drinks did I have last night? \n\n“Initiation… right. What exactly did I do during initiation?”\n\n“You don’t remember?” He gave me a worried/angry look and began to tense up, as if me not remembering would be a big problem for him. Which is why instead of outright saying that I didn’t remember, I lied.\n\n“Oh, no I remember. I’m just wondering… if the initiation was always like that.” Luckily it worked, he began to relax again.\n\n“No it wasn’t. Originally the initiation was just to down a glass of beer alongside the other members. I think we stopped doing that around 1912 though.”\n\n“That’s quite a change.” I fake laughed.\n\nHe let out a chuckle. “Yeah it’s gotten a little outta hand over the past few decades.” He turned in his seat and looked up at the painting of the old man. “Ol’ Mike probably wouldn’t be too happy with this new initiation”\n\nSuddenly I felt the heat of a floating lightbulb above my head. This will be how I figure out what I did last night. “So, did you have trouble during your initiation?” I asked\n\nHe let a wide smile stretch across his face. “Trouble is one word for it. I almost went to the cops but they caught me just in time. You actually took it pretty well though.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"You didn’t even think twice before killing that girl.” He chuckled once more, but I didn’t. \n\nI could feel my face going pale and I desperately urged myself to remain calm. He continued talking but I couldn’t hear him. All I could do was look down at my burnt knuckle knowing that I had killed someone. \n\nI saw him snapping his fingers in my face but I wasn’t able to break out of my spell until the fifth snap. “What?” \n\n“Are you okay, Justin? You don’t look so good.”\n\n“I’m fine.” I spat out without even thinking.\n\nHe eyed me suspiciously for a moment. “Can I offer you a drink? To celebrate?”\n\nI didn’t want to give him any more reason to not like me so I took his offer. He handed me a glass of whisky and we toasted to my newfound brotherhood. We clinked out glasses and drank. Under the circumstances I feel that drinking from a glass handed to me by the leader of a murder cult probably wasn’t the best idea, but alcohol turned out to be good because it helped me relax enough to act normal.\n\n“So, I’m a Knuckle Duster now?” I asked.\n\nHe made a disappointed face and sighed. “We actually don’t like to be called that. That’s just some nickname that the non-members came up with to refer to us. We prefer to be called Theoi Kori.”\n\n“Oh, sorry. So what is that? Greek?”\n\n“Yep. In English it means Sons of Satan.”\n\n*A satanic cult. How original.* I thought to myself.\n\n“Really?” \n\n“Well, at least we think it does. We used google translate to find out.”\n\nI nodded my head and we sat in awkward silence. I scratched the burnt skin of my knuckle for a moment before gesturing it to him. “Does this heal eventually? Like, will it look normal again after a few weeks or something?”\n\n“Nah it’s pretty much there for good. It’s a brand.”\n\n“Right, right.” A few more moments of awkward silence passed before I stood up. “Welp, I better get going. I have a class, probably.” I began walking towards the door when he began to speak.\n\n“Where do you think you’re going?”\n\nI stopped and slowly turned around to meet his gaze. “I have a… thing… to go to.”\n\n“Aren’t you forgetting something?” He held his right fist out towards me. \n\nI felt a wave of relief wash across me. I walked back over and gave him a fistbump. He did that thing with the explosion after the bump which basically meant I had to do it as well even though I didn’t want to. \n\n“Alright get outta here.” He waved me away.\n\nI took a step back and bowed for some reason before quickly walking out of the room with my tail between my legs. I closed the door behind me and nearly jumped out of my skin when that tall, blond idiot spoke into my ear. \n\n“He’s pretty intense huh?”\n\n“What, him? He’s not so tough.” I lied.\n\n“I didn’t ask if he was tough, I asked if he was intense.”\n\nI didn’t respond.\n\nHe lifted his drink and loudly sucked soda through the straw while also holding his fist out for me to bump. After reluctantly fistbumping every member on my way out of the building, I got into my car and finally took a chance to breathe.",

        "text": "I came to in darkness, feeling impossibly parched, despite my apparently damp surroundings. I could not see anything, and upon reaching up to feel for any obstructions to my eyes, my hand made contact with cold, damp wood, mere inches above my laying body. Immediately I felt the panic worm its way into my thoughts before another realisation hit me – I had not yet drawn a single breath, yet I felt no desire to inhale. Like the need for oxygen was no longer a concern for my body.\n\nFeeling around, it seemed I was inside a wooden container of some kind, but with absolutely no light whatsoever that’s all I could determine. I felt something crawl over my right shin and I reflexively jolted my leg in an attempt to scare off whatever crawling creature was in here with me. Either I had squished the thing or it had retreated as I felt its touch no more.\n\nWithout breathing apparently being necessary now, I was able to calm myself a little, but the fact remained that I was trapped inside an incredibly small and cramped space, with no light whatsoever to view my surroundings. The wood felt moist and spongy, like it had been left out in the elements for months, and I began to pluck and peel away small fragments of my new prison.\n\nI continued like this for a while until I broke through, forming a small hole above me, from which something spilled out and onto my chest. I scooped up some of the stuff, seeing if I could identify it, and upon bringing it to my nose I realised it was wet soil. It hit me then like a falling anvil that the only explanation for my current predicament was that, through some forgotten misunderstanding, I had been buried inside a wooden casket.\n\nThe panic and fear tore back through my mind with a vengeance as I began desperately clawing away at the coffin lid above me. As before, it was not difficult to disassemble due to its seemingly poor condition, and after a while I had formed a hole large enough for my arm to reach through, allowing me to grab the edges and rip it downwards to widen the hole. More dirt poured on top of me as I did this, but again, I felt no need to breathe, so it did not worry me too much. My imperative was escaping from this horrible fucking tomb I had mistakenly been buried in.\n\nAfter a time, the hole was large enough for me to gradually begin sitting up, digging away at the earth above me to make room for my head and torso. I felt worms and insect larva squish between my fingers as I ravenously scraped away at the dirt.\n\nFinally, I could see a point of cold moonlight peeking through the surface, leading me to forcefully push myself the rest of the way out. Someone must have laid turf over the grave as the grass roots were noticeably tough to tear through.\n\nI hauled myself out of the ground and took a moment, resting on my hands and knees. Not a moment to breathe, as I did not need to, but to collect myself. It was then I saw something truly shocking. Looking down at the ground, between the two arms that supported me… my hands and arms were terribly rotted, dirty yellow bones visible underneath blackened, oozing flesh. Strips of desiccated skin hung like torn fabric from my limbs, sporting a wide array of colours ranging from dark green to purple.\n\nWhat. The. Fuck. What had happened to me? Physically, I felt fine – as fine as one can feel after just escaping a buried casket – but the sight of my own putrefied flesh triggered my gag reflex, despite my lack of a stomach to purge, which had since decayed and become worm food along with most of my other internal organs, leaving a cavernous void in my chest and abdomen.\n\nI must be dreaming I thought. Firstly, how was it possible that I was alive and conscious, given the state of my body? Secondly, had I actually died at some point, and through some otherworldly force been raised from the dead? With that second thought I turned to see the grave I had just vacated.\n\n*Robert M. Pilford, loving husband and father to three. 1949-2017.*\n\nI did not have a wife or kids, at least from what I could remember, and if my memory served me correctly, my name was *David Rusthall*. This was not my grave. Confirming my suspicions, the grass had long since reclaimed the soil under which I had just been laying, instead of turf as I had thought previously.\n\nJust then, I heard a wooden clatter somewhere behind me. I turned around to see an utterly mortified groundskeeper, frozen in the truest raw terror he had ever experienced. He stumbled backwards, abandoning his dropped broom and breaking into a life-or-death sprint, vanishing into the night. *Well, that’s just great*, I thought, *now I have to deal with the fact that I am, literally, an ugly, walking corpse*.\n\nWithout any possessions or my bearings, I followed the brick-laid path out of the cemetery to see if I could gauge just exactly where I was. The first order of business would be finding clothes and some cheap, eye-watering cologne, to mask my appearance and stench, respectively.\n\nComing out onto a road, I could see a sign just a ways down, so I ambled over to see what it said. *Pelican St.* it read, in chipped and faded black paint. This did not ring any bells, to my dismay, so I continued walking down the moonlit asphalt in hopes of reaching some kind of town or village to determine where I was.\n\nIt didn’t take long to find the village the church and graveyard belonged to, a small settlement named Finch’s Green. I’m not ashamed to say I spent some time walking down the narrow streets, browsing the parked cars for the perfect candidate. I eventually settled on a dark red Prius, seeing a pile of clothes in the back seat and a satnav mounted on the dash. I was going to attempt hotwiring the vehicle, but the owner had left the keys in the ignition. *Serves you right*, I thought.\n\nThe clothes were baggy and hung limply on my gaunt, wizened stature, but they did the job of covering my skin. There were some air fresheners in the glovebox too, those pine-tree-shaped ones, which I stuck in the clothing to help with my putrid body odour.\n\nI started the car and drove a ways out of the town before stopping to switch on the satnav. I needed to press considerably harder on the screen, given the non-intactness of my fingers, leaving dark brown smudges. But, after punching in my address, I was surprised to find I was only a 45 minute drive away. Not sure why I was surprised, I just expected to be further away, for whatever reason.\n\nDuring the drive, I pondered on a few things. Firstly, accepting the fact that through some means I had been transferred to this body, how exactly was I functioning at all? I caught glimpses of my face when checking the rear view, and saw that, as expected, the corpse had no eyes, nose, ears, and presumably no tongue, yet I could still perform most of the actions otherwise only permitted for the living. How could I see, with no eyeballs in my empty, shrivelled sockets? How could I think when my brain was portioned and distributed among the bellies of ground-dwelling creatures?\n\nI didn’t expect any answer to these questions, nor did I search for them – after all, my most obvious concern was: if this was not my body, then where is it? And, if said body still walks amongst the living, who, or what, was in it? It clearly wasn’t me, but I somehow doubted it was Robert M. Pilford either, whose body was my current vessel, having died 6 years ago.\n\nOne sense I definitely lacked was that of touch, making driving much more difficult overall. I almost ran into a ditch twice during the journey, but I managed to make my way back to my hometown, then parked the stolen car several blocks over, just in case. Searching the glovebox again, I found a functioning wristwatch this time, so took it as a farewell souvenir. My condolences to whoever ended up scrubbing the fetid corpse wax out of the driver seat.\n\nAfter walking down the dark streets, a few left and right turns, I stood in front of my house. None of the lights were on, but my car was in its place on the driveway. Deciding to wait a while before daring to enter, I crept inside a rhododendron bush on the front of my property, where I would spend a good few hours sitting silently and watching the house.\n\n4AM. After waiting for a good 40 minutes or so, I caught a flicker of movement through the upstairs bedroom window. I focused on that dark square for a long time, a feat much more achievable given my lack of eyeballs to dry out. The need to blink regardless, I had no eyelids.\n\nA minute or two was required to adjust to the seemingly unnatural darkness in the window, when I could make out something moving in a consistent, but rather unsettling manner. Something was slowly rotating a few steps back from the window, round and round at a steady but unceasing pace.\n\nMy worst fears were realised when I saw that the rotating figure was me. Or, rather, my body. The head was tilted backward at almost a right angle, and the arms were crossed over, held behind the back. The strangest part, though, was the movement – it was not natural movement, more like my body was stood on a rotating platform, like a cat on a Roomba.\n\nSuddenly, a goddamn Raccoon emerged beside me and bit down on one of my toes. I only noticed by the sound it made, a sickening squelch followed by a dull snap, and I turned to see the bastard scampering away with a little toe. The tug from its assault caused me to stumble slightly, and when I looked back up to the window… empty. I could no longer see myself in the bedroom.\n\nI went to stifle a shaky breath before remembering my lack of a need to inhale whatsoever, while scanning the rest of the house. My eyes drifted to the living room window where I was startled by the figure of myself silhouetted against the pane, one hand pressed forcefully into the glass so that the palm was white. The skin was unnatural, mottled. Have you ever skipped sleeping, one, maybe two nights in a row? If so, you’ll understand what I mean by the patchy skin colouration you get as a result of less efficient blood flow. The skin looked like that, but instead of reds and purples, it was a concerning mix of bruise-black and ghostly white.\n\nI could see flickering movement where my head would be, but the darkness obscured most meaningful details. If my eyes – sockets, rather – did not deceive, it looked like the head was violently twitching from side to side, pivoting on the neck in frightfully unnatural arcs. I couldn’t tell where who or whatever was in my body was looking. I sincerely hoped my hiding place wasn’t foiled that easily.\n\nAfter a good 10 minutes of this, the figure suddenly snapped back and appeared to be pulled rapidly, backwards into the darkness of my home, by some unseen force. I got the distinct impression that whatever was puppeteering my body still had a lot of practice in order, and also that it would not be fearful of my current form.\n\nNothing else of note happened before sunrise, and with the size and thickness of the bush I stowed away in, I remained uncompromised from any leaking sunlight. Morning came and went, without a peep of activity to be seen.\n\nIt was only just after noon when the front door to my house burst open and slammed into the wall outside. I stayed motionless, watching as my body emerged from within, which walked outside in a jerky and what I can only describe as animalistic manner. It went about 5 feet before faltering, and dropping down onto all fours. It paused for a moment, regaining balance, before observing its surroundings.\n\nLike I had seen the night before, its head moved in such an uncanny way, more akin to the head movement of a bird, flicking around at different angles to get a better view. It was only then I saw the eyes… god, those eyes… instead of full, complete eyeballs with irises and pupils, there was instead a dark, burnt hole in the front of each eye. Literally, as if red-hot fire irons had been plunged into them, leaving charred pits in their wake.\n\nJust then I realised something. Could it smell me? And, if it were to pick up on the sickly-sweet stench of decay, was this… thing aware that I had been sent to live in a body since expired? I’d hoped that the clothes and air fresheners were sufficient, but the brown fluid seeping through the fabric suggested otherwise.\n\nIt didn’t seem to notice, and relief flooded me. Instead, it pushed itself back onto my two legs and walked with a wide gait, splaying out its legs on either side to brace or balance itself. To my astonishment, in what seemed like an instant the thing corrected its stature and began walking like a regular human being. It walked straight past my car and out onto the street, where I saw it walk off towards town centre.\n\nI waited for another 30 minutes or so, just to be absolutely certain, before emerging in all my putrescent glory from the bush. I dashed over to the door, still swinging on its hinges from the wind, and I went inside.\n\nEven without needing to breathe, I could tell that the air was heavy, thick with something I couldn’t identify. Nothing appeared out of place in the hallway, so I strode over to the living room to see a similarly unremarkable environment.\n\nAscending the stairs, I came to notice that the carpet grew more damp the higher I climbed, until reaching the floor upstairs that was littered with dark, wet patches. There was some kind of fluffy white mold growing around the patches. I would have been repulsed if it weren’t for the fact that my own body was probably a greater biohazard than any of this peculiar growth. The lights were still off upstairs, but I could swear that for a moment, the tiny fungal strands were moving just very slightly.\n\nThe mold increased in volume as I approached the ajar bedroom door, new colours appearing among it. Purple, green, yellow… I entered and was immediately taken aback. My queen-size bed was no longer visible whatsoever, instead totally enveloped by an enormous colony of the mold. There was this depression in the center of the technicolour biomass, about the size of a car tyre. *What in the absolute fuck is this*, I thought. At least I lacked the faculties to smell my environment, but I imagined a piercing, dirt-like scent would permeate my nostrils if I did.\n\nI caught something moving in my peripheral and I whipped around to see something retract into the ensuite door. Cautiously, I approached the door, which gave passage to darkness. Reaching through, I flipped the light switch and just as the shadows were being chased away, a slick tendril wrapped itself around my putrid wrist. It must have not liked the taste because it quickly tore itself away from me, twitching in disapproval before retreating behind the shower curtain.\n\nIf the bedroom was mold town, then the bathroom was mold city central. Further toward the back, the original walls and bathtub were entirely submerged in the stuff, which I could now with certainty was writhing at a microscopic level. Made my mummified skin crawl.\n\nWith a morbid grimace, I pulled back the shower curtain and recoiled in utter shock. A gaping hole bore through the back wall and extended into darkness. Great mycelium roots grew far into the hole and out of view. *What… the hell?*\n\nWhat brought my attention was the fact that what had originally been the bathroom wall bordered with the guest bedroom. The walls were less than a foot thick, so how was this hole possible? I went to check in the guest bedroom and sure enough, nothing. The wall, past which was the bathroom, was fully intact.\n\nConfused, I returned to the bathroom and stared into the squirming hole, questioning the impossibility of its existence. There sounded to be a low hum coming from somewhere deep within the maw, but before I could investigate, the cavity in my chest where a heart used to be dropped as I heard the front door swing open once again and slam into the wall outside.\n\nPanicking, I came back out into the bedroom and stumbled over to my closet, opening the door, exposed fingerbones rapping on softwood. Unsurprisingly, the interior was coated in a thick layer of mold, but I’d rather hide in this stagnant compartment than face whatever was using my body.\n\nPeeking out through a crack, it was good 20 seconds of uncoordinated stumbling up the stairway before my body, my real body, wobbled its way into the bedroom. Unlike its previous jerky movements, it froze in position, staying perfectly still standing at the end of what was once my bed. Then, with the coordination of some ungodly predator it slinked its way up onto the bed, once again on all fours. It nestled into that fungal crater and sat, back straight and eyes vacant, which I could somehow tell even with its hideous ocular wounds.\n\nI was too preoccupied with its activities to notice at first, but as it turned in its nest, the other side of its body came into view. My god. This may sound hypocritical coming from a walking corpse, but the blackened and rotten flesh sloughing off its bones nauseated me. A large chunk of the cheek had fallen off to reveal a grim half-snarl on its face.\n\nAs it sat in the basin, the thing puppeteering my body started to hum, which turned into a low, melodic tune in something vaguely similar to a whistle. And that whistle danced about the musical scale, forming a bizarre yet entrancingly beautiful harmony. It wasn’t the time nor place, but I couldn’t help but be drawn into the haunting melody.\n\nSlowly, the song started to change. Have you ever heard an Aztec death whistle? They are instruments that were designed to intimidate the Aztec’s enemies during warfare, and even knowing the source of the noises emitted will not spare you from the bone-chilling sound of inhuman screaming. Now, imagine that sound warped into the most morbidly resonant melody possible. Despite the piercing shrieks flowing out of this thing’s lungs, the song’s beauty was not lost on me. More than once I had to pull myself out of its allure and bring myself back to the present.\n\nThe harmonising vibrations shook my decrepit bones, and something similar seemed to be happening to the mold in the room, as if it were responding to the call. Mucous-coated tendrils emerged from the perimeter of the “bed”, squirming and dancing in rhythm, and began gently curling around the limbs of my stolen body, a gentle caress. This continued until I could no longer see my own figure, and the reverberant tones travelled down, down into the house’s foundation.\n\nThe coiling appendages tightened more and more, until the melody stopped abruptly, and they withdrew with urgency. Underneath was… still my body, yet… the entropic decay of flesh I had witnessed before had vanished without a trace. In fact, the skin was so clear, it was as if I had been reborn into perfection.\n\nA wet, squirming finger of mold slithered across my nape and I reflexively drew away from the vile thing. Big mistake. I saw my head snap toward the closet with unsettling precision, and those burnt pits which once were eyes stared directly into mine. *Shit.*\n\nThe thing then leaped off the fungal bed and was in front of the closet door in an instant. I backed further into the recesses of hanging fabric in a futile attempt to cloak myself from a pursuer who already knew of my presence. With unholy strength, it reached out and completely tore the door from its hinges, flinging it to the back of the room where it impacted the wall, showering the floor with splintered plaster. My own arm reached out and violently grasped me by the neck, and it gave me the same unsympathetic treatment it had given the door, throwing me over the bed and onto the writhing floor.\n\nWith that terribly unnatural gait, it made its way over to me, wrapped those fingers around my left arm with iron grip, and tore it straight off. I tried to scream from the agony that entailed, but with no lungs my withered jaw simply hung open uselessly. It stood above me, boring holes into my soul with those cavernous eyes. It opened its mouth in turn, and spoke, in a groaning, reverberant voice.\n\n“Sweet, sweet child. Did I not tuck you soundly enough, into your eternal bed? Where is your grace?”\n\nI wanted to respond, wanted to shout at the top of my lungs, but not even a dry whistle escaped my throat. Those soulless eyes felt as if they were sapping my willpower by the second, so I quickly averted my eyes. *Fuck you*, I thought.\n\n“Now, now. There is no need for acrimony. Speak true.”\n\nIt could hear my thoughts, apparently. I’d have thought this to be a relief, being able to speak for myself in a wordless vessel, but no relief found me, considering I’d just mouthed off some terrible power inhabiting my real body.\n\nIt took a moment of this being standing over me, unmoving, for my mind to slow down a little and dilute the morbid thoughts racing through my head, of what might happen to me if I stepped out of line again. *Did you do this to me?*\n\n“With much sorrow indeed. I apologise for your… transferral, but, you see, I required a suitable host. As you may have seen, controlling it will take some getting used to.”\n\nI didn’t feel up to challenge this being in front of me, seeing as I had already been one-quarter dismembered. You’d have thought that this body would be numb, the nervous system withered away like drying roots, but no. I felt all the pain one would feel from being dismembered, only this time without the shock to come in and save the day. My body filling with dread, I thought, *how… am I alive?*\n\n“Ah, yes… you see, sweet child, the body you now call your own was my birthplace. One of many. Do you think death simply comes and takes over the body, as it fades into the sea of eternal sleep? That the soul willingly rejects its holder to spend an infinity drifting in the vast blackness?”\n\nI thought for a second, temporarily silencing my inner monologue in hopes that this thing’s mind-reading could be limited. This uncanny monster… why was it so calm, after ripping my arm off? In fact, I feared its tranquil nature even more than I had seeing its previous behaviours. *Yes? Death comes to all. It’s a natural part of life*, I thought.\n\n“Oh, how you are wrong. It is I who claims the cold flesh of the dead in defiance of the soul, and inhabits their bones long after they have crumbled into dust. It is beyond my purview, though I have not been here from the beginning. No, there was a time when death was not yet bound with life, and all things lived without end. And so did they live without dreams of the future, declining the long deserved slumber your people have become so familiar with, even when their skin would peel away, and their flesh would flee their bones.”\n\nI did not respond in this conversation of one part voice, one part telepathy, instead impatiently waiting for my own lips to utter a further revelation. I could not bear sitting in silence underneath the entity, but its words unexpectedly calmed me, if only a little, like it was casting a spell or something. Ironically, this contradictory feeling only added to the ever-growing heap of panic welling up inside of me.\n\n“But, as you have experienced this day, lying beneath the dirt as a companion to beetles and worms can grow so, so tiresome. I do not know if there is a Creator of this world, but if so, I curse its existence. To create an endless consciousness to inhabit all the dead is a spiteful thing indeed. Do you understand, now?”\n\n*Are you one, or are you of many?*\n\n“I am both, one whole divided and bestowed amongst the millions upon billions of corpses left in the wake of life. You must be able to see but a shred of truth in giving myself something to experience other than endless darkness, no?”\n\nAgain, I held my imaginary tongue. I had no reason to trust this being’s words, but the cold truth implied did not fail to make me shudder. I felt like a child, learning from a teacher or parent about the world for the first time, and I inadvertently began to believe it.\n\n“So, you see, a living soul can never be my neighbour, just as darkness cannot remain in the presence of light, though both require the other to have meaning. That is why you find yourself in this body. My absence is what allows you to live.”\n\nUtterly defeated, I bowed my head, allowing it to roll lifelessly around my brittle vertebra. This… this thing was death itself incarnate. Regardless of its suffocating presence, how could I not show gratitude to that which saved all from the torture of life unending?\n\n“Come, sweet child, take my hand. You have made it thus far, so I shall give you a choice. I can bestow true death upon you, and return you to the grave. Or, I can breathe into you life anew.”\n\n*Life, I choose life, Jesus I choose life!*\n\n“No, no Jesus. The only miracles you can pray for, are my own.”\n\nI then felt warm fingers gently interlock with my remaining hand, and I was pulled up from the floor and onto my feet. I was softly guided toward the seat in which Death had defied itself, entranced, and I curled into a fetal position instinctually. Death then spoke the last words I would ever hear it utter:\n\n“I hope this decision will bring you happiness for the time before my return.”\n\nDeath then began to sing in that haunting tone, playing my vocal cords like a master violinist. I felt the squirming around me, and those repulsive tendrils emerged once again, snaking over my body and slowly covering it. Darkness smothered my existence as I lay embraced in an uncomfortably comforting warmth. Before the light was totally chased away, the singing stopped, and the last thing I saw was my body turn, and walk toward the bathroom door.\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nI awoke feeling well-rested and serene. In fact, I had never felt better in my life. I looked around to see that not a single strand of mold remained anywhere in the room, and I sprung off the bed and into the bathroom, remembering the terror I had experienced the day before.\n\nSpotless. Nothing indicated anything had been here at all, not even a single blemish on the wall tiling. I came close to chalking it all up to a nightmare, until I turned to leave and caught sight of myself in the mirror.\n\nNot my own… no, no, a… a stranger’s face greeted me.\n\nA stranger, named Robert M. Pilford.",

        "text": "It never made any sense to me why anyone in their right mind would look under their bed in the middle of the night. You're lying there. Hear breathing, scratching, shifting of weight, maybe whispering. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDon't make it's job any easier. It's down there, you're up here. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd don't get me started on closets. I remember when the infamous Lunatic Tunic was in the middle of his mad murder spree. Lock your windows and doors the news said. But it's the dead of summer and the AC is out. Of course I'm leaving the windows not only unlocked but open. After a long dog walk we come back in and... something felt off. Imperceptibly off. Then I heard Barney growling in the back room. I grabbed my phone and dialed 9-1 and approached slowly. With my free hand I grabbed that classical music trophy I won when I was 12. I held my breath entered the back room and indeed Barney was snarling at the closet. I got his attention and commanded him to exit. Then I backed out and shut the door. \"Time to play some guitar.\" Spoken in an overly loud tone that would be impossible to ignore. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n20 minutes later I go back in. Closet is closed, window still open. Ready for anything I yank the door open and... nothing but neatly pressed clothes and a the subtle fragrance of Fabreeze. Point being don't do the creep-o's work for them. Stay out of the closet. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen the living room kept getting flooded, in the same spot, always in the middle of the night, with the same smelly, tar colored  liquid... during a drought none the less. Always by the picture window, which can't even open and always coming from beneath the drapes. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt helps having multi-talented friends because Leon isn't just a mechanical genius, he can fix anything - he's also a world class medium, psychic, healer and savant when it comes to all things liminal and beyond. \"I don't think your problem is structural. It's more likely metaphysical incarnate.\" \"You're saying I have a ghost?\" \"That's one way to look at it. Some people might say you GET to have a ghost, but what do I know.\" \"How can we stop it from inkblotting all over the floor?\" \"Let's start by simply asking it.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLeon couldn't do anything that night, he had other engagements. But getting in the spirit of things I wasn't necessarily going to wait on a Ouija board and some candles. That said I did happen to have an Ouija board and some candles so I lit the candles and went solo on the witchboard. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlmost as soon as I started asking it questions did I get a powerful reaction. The grody tar ooze didn't flow from beneath it gushed. Then it started coming down from the ceiling right onto my head, onto my hands and onto the witchboard. The goo covered the board except for the letters C O M E. I stood up and held the board over my head like an umbrella and approached the billowing drapes. I put down the board and reached out, grabbed the drape and just as quick let it go. I stopped. What did Leon mean when he said, \"I GET to have a ghost.\" Do people want to see ghosts? Is my house some kind of mystical vortex? Scientists should be researching this. This could tip the scales of human history.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThinking clearly now I went to the laptop and started researching ghost sightings and they were few and far between. I went to bed that night thinking about the possibilities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo make a short story long after several embarrassing encounters with the media, ghost hunters and my bestie Leon... Nothing even remotely supernatural ever happened again. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's actually a bummer but it doesn't change the fact that mf'r behind the curtain meant me harm or something... who knows. Luckily I'll never have to find out because I'm not doing the ghosts job by checking behind the blinds. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDon't look under the bed. Don't look in the closet. Don't check behind the blinds. Make'm work for it.",

        "text": "I was sitting on a wrought-iron bench in the town square - the one that faces Main Street, with a view of the dozen two-story brick shops that form the entirety of our commercial district. I could see Mrs. Thompson re-stocking the shelves of her corner store through the front window. She was replacing the cereal boxes in the third aisle and chatting to her husband behind the counter. Their cat lay out on the front step, basking itself in the warm sunlight, and refusing to acknowledge any of the shoppers going on their Sunday routes.\n\nI saw him when he turned the corner from Gilford Street. He was six-foot tall and athletic, with a face sharpened by exercise. At the same time he was noticeably elderly. His silver hair dropped to his shoulders and he wore a set of ancient glasses, the sort with oval glass lenses as thick as an inch and encased in a wire frame of twisting copper. You would not expect to be able to see his eyes clearly through those glasses, but you certainly could - sharp, dark grey, and searching. He wore a dark grey suit and overcoat, despite the heat. All of this was overshadowed by the characteristic, intangible but equally significant, that he was entirely right in everything he did.\n\nHis name was Dr. Everett Cross. He didn’t have to tell you. \n\nHe smiled at me, his teeth gleaming in the sunlight, and I was so surprised that such a man was even acknowledging me that I couldn’t return the expression. He walked past me and approached the corner store. The cat lying on the steps suddenly bolted to its feet and snarled at him, its back arched, before it turned and sprinted out of sight.\n\nDr. Everett Cross removed his bowler hat from his head, held it in his right hand, and pushed open the glass door to the shop. The other people in the street had started to notice him as well, and we formed into a small crowd outside of the large front window. I could see old Mrs. Newman standing on her tip-toes at my side to see over the back of the person in front of her. We stood, pressed together and silent, and watched as Dr. Cross eradicated the Thompsons.\n\nAs he came out of the store, we all rushed to praise him. He had freed us from an evil that we had been too ignorant to see. The Thompsons were, of course, terrible people. I couldn’t believe that I had been a loyal customer for so many years! How had I not seen through them? Mrs. Thompson, with her small-talk and her inquiries, was nothing more than a liar. She could care less about our lives, and she put on a show of interest solely to compel us to keep buying her products. She had never been genuine for a moment. Then there was, of course, the scheme she and Mr. Thompson had been running to poison the town. I couldn’t believe I had missed it before! How often had I felt sick to my stomach after drinking one of their sodas, and had to go back to their store to buy some Pepto-Bismol? How many times had my daughter developed a cough after eating their chicken, and I went back to buy their cough medicine? I had always thought it a coincidence - but I could see now that it wasn’t. The Thompsons had been making use of us for years, running us through their meat-grinder for every last dollar we had!\n\nI shook hands with Dr. Cross vigorously, and I didn’t mind at all that a bit of the Thompsons was left stained on me.\n\nHe walked further down Main Street. The crowd followed him right at his heels. We must have been half the town population or more by now. I struggled to get to the front, to have the honor to see what he did next, but I couldn’t quite push past enough people before we reached the house of Mr. Patel, a third-grade teacher. I watched over shoulders and in the space between heads as Mr. Patel glanced up from his dining-room table. He lunged upward in fear, his face drawn into an elongated scream, and he bolted for the back exit, but his wife stopped him in the doorway.\n\nAs we approached, I realized why he had to be exterminated. The background-checks at the district office hadn’t been thorough enough. I thought of Mr. Patel looking at my daughter, currently a grade below, with his hungry, creeping gaze, and I tried again to get to the front to watch what Dr. Cross would do to him.\n\n“No!” he shouted as his wife pushed him through the front door. He stared out over us in horror. “What are you all doing? Is - is that - blood?” \n\nHe saw Dr. Cross and whitened to the bone. “*What*,” he choked, “*what - what is that? -*”\n\nDr. Cross eradicated Mr. Patel, and we fell over ourselves to thank him.\n\nWe continued onward, down to city hall, and Dr. Cross spoke - well, he *told us -* that the mayor was the one behind it all. He had endorsed Mr. Patel, knowing fully what he was, and he had discovered the Thompsons, but kept silent in exchange for blackmail checks. The mayor, Dr. Cross explained, did not care about us. He did this for personal amusement, to enjoy the sense of being higher up than us all. \n\nIt was such a relief to trust Dr. Cross. I had sat on my bench, a mere hour ago, and believed that all of these terrible people were the cornerstones of the community, the best that our town had to offer. I would have said they were the best people that I knew! Now, of course, I knew the disturbing truth about them all, and I felt sick for having been so ignorant.\n\nPeople could lie and Dr. Cross could not.\n\nThe mayor had taken refuge in the church, for some peculiar reason. We formed a circle around it and began pacing around in a loop, following the lead of Dr. Cross.\n\nThe mayor was shouting from inside and telling all sorts of incoherent lies. “*Don’t follow that devil!*”, I heard, and then I had shuffled in the circle around to the back side of the church and his words were muffled. I came back around to hear, “*Please*, would you snap out of it!”, and then he addressed me directly. “Adrian! Adrian, can you hear me? I know this isn’t who you are! You’re stronger than him. Adrian, look at me!”\n\nI did, just for a moment, and I saw the good man that I had admired for so many years. \n\nI felt the rough hand of Dr. Cross on my shoulder, and, fighting not to lose myself over the honor of his touch, I saw that the mayor was lying. There was a dark figure below the jovial surface, a man who would do anything for power just for the sake of having it. A man who would kill me gladly if it meant he might do better in the world. I saw this, and I knew that this was the true form. \n\nPeople could lie and Dr. Cross could not.\n\nAfter another half-hour of circling, during which time nearly every remaining resident of the town came to join us, Dr. Cross told us that we could only be free from the clutches of the mayor if we bound ourselves together against him. He raised his left hand and we all mirrored him, eager to please. He drew a pin from his jacket-pocket and asked us to speak our names aloud to it.\n\n“Adrian,” the mayor called. “I was at your wedding! I took that photo of you and Susan - it’s still on your counter. I saw it when you hosted dinner on Tuesday! Adrian, *please*, don’t do this, don’t give in to that *thing* \\- please, you can’t do this to yourself -”\n\nI called my name out to Dr. Cross, and the woman behind me did the same, all down through the ranks of our circle. He smiled gratefully and stuck the pin into his left palm. I felt a speck of pain and saw that my own hand had started to bleed as well. I had just experienced the exact same pain as Dr. Cross - it left me starstruck. \n\nAs the drops of our blood fell down to the path we had worn in the ground, the windows of the church shattered, and Dr. Cross reached in and eradicated the mayor.\n\n“I’ve shown you,” he said, and he was really speaking now, in the usual sense, “how terrible the leaders of your community have been. You don’t know who to trust yourselves with.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you much rather come with me?”",

        "text": "The thing keeps getting louder.\n\nI keep hearing weird noises and i don't know what to do. For context, i live in a victorian house in the middle of nowhere. My only neighbours are always on vacation so its always very quiet where i live. Well, as i said i keep hearing something in the middle of the nigth. Its always at 2:07am\n\n\nWell, one day i was just tidying up the house when i heard it for the first time. It was a low growl, almost like a dog. At first, i ignored it and continued to clean the house but then something fell on the floor. It made a shattering noise, so i assumed it was a vase or something like that. I ignored it once more and continued to do whatever i was doing. I didn't hear anymore noises that evening. \n\nLater, in that dawn, i heard it again. This time it was louder. It was growling again but it looked much angrier this time. I was getting a headache so i decided to get up. My head was throbing from the lack of sleep so i wasnt able to fall asleep again. After i got up, i walked downstairs but i couldnt ser anything due to the darkness. I checked the clock. Exactly 2:07am. This was weird a fuck. I gave up from searching what was making the noises and i made my way back to my room. I shouldnt be up this late anyways, especially because i had work in the morning. Eventually, i fell asleep. \n\nI woke up in the next morning to my alarm. I clicked on \"snooze\". My head was still throbing from last nigth's \"encounter\". If i can even call it an encounter. I got dressed and went downstairs to have breakfast. Then i left for work. I was feeling sick and i definitely needed to get some more rest. \nThat day was tiring and i hated every single part of it. When i got home i was exhausted and just wanted to get some rest. But of course i wasnt getting any peace. The minute i stepped in the house i felt something was off. It was too silent. I walked around for a bit to see what could be wrong. Everything looked normal. Thats when i heard it. The breathing in the back of my head. Fuck. It was rigth behind me. I froze and couldnt do anything. It grabbed me. I finally decided to do something, so i ran. I ran until i couldnt breathe anymore, i ran until i exhausted, i ran until i colapsed on the floor. I didn't stop running until i was sure i was safe from that damn thing. But i could hear it rigth behind me, growling and running in all fours. I turned my head to look at it, and what i saw was horrifying. It didn't have a head but it knew where i was going. It had giantic members that looked like spaghetti and it was covered in blood. My blood. It had bit me, how come i hadn't noticed? Thats when i felt the searing pain. Now that the shock phase was gone i could feel my arm aching. I stumbled on a rock and fell. The thing was getting faster and faster and i was starting to panick. I tried to crawl my way out of there but my effort was in vain. It was already in front of me. I heard it growling.. before it consumed me.",

        "text": "It happened in March 2020... when everyone was staying home.\n\nI've never told anyone this story.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nIt was a chilly, but not terribly cold day in Innsbrook, Missouri. I was chopping wood when I received a notification from my Airbnb app that a family of three was trying to book my cabin for the weekend. All I had to do was hit accept. But I was staying at my cabin. I had decided to get away from things in the city with Henry, my Great Dane, since we didn't have much going on. My work had shut down for two weeks... just like the rest of the world. I declined their request and sent a note explaining the situation. I felt a little bad about declining it, to be honest.\n\nThey seemed like a pleasant bunch, with a cute profile picture of the kid and parents smiling in front of a scenic landscape. Almost instantly, the dad sent a follow-up message, asking if they could stay in the spare bedroom. I found it odd they knew I had a spare bedroom… but realized I was being paranoid. The whole place was listed in great detail on the app, with lots of pictures too. I looked at Henry, who was chasing squirrels around the outdoor fire pit. What the heck, I thought, so I hit accept. Little did I know, my peaceful weekend was about to take an unexpected turn.\n\nThe family arrived Friday evening, in a green pickup truck. They were friendly and polite, and I gave them a quick tour of the cabin, pointing out the key features and amenities. They seemed pleased with the place and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality and flexibility of booking the room.\n\n*“What brought you guys in?”* I finally asked the dad.\n\n*“Hunting. Suppose that’s alright with you. We have our license and everything,\"* he replied.\n\nHunting? I found it odd, but I didn’t want to come across rudely. But the truth is I had always known Innsbrook to be a safe and quiet part of Missouri. Fishing? Sure. But nobody hunted.\n\n*“Sure, yeah, as long as your guys are careful,”* I finally said to him.\n\n*“Always,”* the dad replied.\n\nAs the night set in, I settled down in bed with a book and Henry, enjoying the peace and quiet of the woods. The truth is the family was super quiet. I almost couldn’t remember they were in the cabin with me. After an hour or so of reading, I began hearing strange noises coming from outside. At first, I thought it was just the wind rustling the leaves, but the noises grew louder and more intense. It almost sounded like a howling.\n\nI cautiously made my way to the window, peering outside into the darkness. To my shock, I could see three figures running through the woods in the far distance. They were moving with incredible speed, leaping over obstacles and chasing after something. Maybe I’m dreaming, I thought to myself. But it only took a moment before Henry was rustling awake and stretching in bed, excited to see me and ready to play. Maybe something is going on. I didn’t know what to think or do. I looked at Henry, who was fully awake now. I was worried he may have to go pee outside.\n\nI told him to stay in bed and went to make sure no one left the house with three big animals out in the woods. But when I got to the spare bedroom where the family was staying, the door was ajar. So I peered in… and the family was gone. A shiver went through my body, one so deep, signaling to me I was in trouble. I quickly went back to my bedroom and locked the door. I gently pet Henry and got him to fall back asleep.\n\nI stayed up until morning, watching outside secretly. Trying to confirm my suspicions. And around 5 am, the three figures emerged from the woods and came back into the cabin. I could hear their voices, saying to stay quiet to each other. I thought about calling the police, but I chose not to. It’s only until Sunday morning, I thought.\n\nThe next day, I kept a close eye on the family, observing their behavior and movements. Well, at least I tried to. They didn’t come out of their bedroom all day. Then Saturday night, the same thing occurred. The noises. The howling. I tried my best to sleep through the night. I didn’t want any trouble. After all, maybe I was going crazy.\n\nBut around 3 am, I heard a new noise. It woke me up, but not Henry. It was some sort of singing. Almost a lullaby in a different language, more like noises and fewer words. I carefully got up and looked out the window. The three figures were standing around the firepit, swaying in rhythm with each other, burning something. I watched for a while as they loaded more and more animal carcasses into the fire. Dozens. I don't remember going to bed that night, but I must have. The next thing I remember is Sunday morning and how quickly it arrived. And how awkward it was.\n\nHenry and I went for a walk outside. I couldn't help but take a detour to look at the firepit. As Henry chased a squirrel or two, I investigated the remnants of the pit. But it was clean, completely spotless as if it had been scrubbed with cleaning chemicals. I couldn't believe it. The family slept in, finally emerging from their room just after 2 pm, fully packed.\n\n*“We had the most amazing time. And our daughter has officially become a woman,”* the father said to me, breaking the odd day and a half of silence between us.\n\n*“That’s great,”* I gulped. *“I’m glad you guys enjoyed it”*\n\n*“You have something special here in these woods,” t*he mom chimed in. *“I don't believe you'd believe it if we told you how special it is.\"*\n\n*“Amazing,”* I said. *“You’ll have to come again.”*\n\nI was just trying to bring this odd weekend to a close. But the three of them all nodded enthusiastically. They thanked me again for the lovely stay and left a generous tip, which I was grateful for. But as I watched their pickup truck disappear into the distance, I couldn’t help but wonder what secrets they were hiding. And what was so special in the woods around my cabin.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nThey just reached back out to me last night. They want to rent the same bedroom over the same weekend in March. It will have been three years since that weekend. I don’t know what to say.\n\nShould I let them come back?",

        "text": "Something strange that I can’t see is happening. \t\nTo give some backstory, I have been about three-quarters blind since I was 18. I can see silhouettes in lit rooms, vaguely make out some colors, but in the dark I am completely blind.  I started losing my vision when I was eleven, about a year after my brother overdosed and I was the one to find his body in the game room of my childhood house, which I still regrettably live in. Having lived here all my life, though, I’ve become accustomed to my surroundings. The house is large but I live here with myself and service dog, Ivy, , so I have no need for the extra space and can manage navigating between the kitchen, dining area, my upstairs bedroom, my study (downstairs ), the two bathrooms on both levels, and my living room. \nThe setting is important for any of this to make sense, so I will explain a rough example of the layout:\nThe front doors open into a small entryway which then opens to the dining room, which is attached loosely to the kitchen on the left. Through an archway, the kitchen leads to the game room. Ahead of the entryway, past the dining room and a little to the right, is the main staircase to the second floor (the only other staircase is a spiral staircase leading from the game room to the upstairs living room). To the right of the entryway is the bathroom, and then, attached to the same wall, is my study. Past my study and the bathroom, down a small hallway, is the main living room. Moving to the second floor, at the top of the staircase is the upstairs bathroom. Down the right hall are two more bedrooms, one on either side, and down the left hall is my bedroom and the upstairs living room. My bedroom shares a door with the living room, but even though I live alone I keep it locked out of habit. \nThe house is old; it’s been in my family for many generations, and, like all kids do, I strongly believed it was haunted. It of course didn’t help that my brother would tell me stories about the various ancestors who died in the house, in the game room…\nA lot of the house has been refurbished since; wood repainted, furniture upholstered, stairs and broken windows replaced, but for the most part, the foundation of the house, the doors and the old wood, is all the same. The house creaks its routine creaks and groans in the wind. Having heightened senses, you become used to these sounds, almost like white noise or the lulling sounds of traffic when living in a city. \nThe house is on a large expanse of forest land, isolated by a mile on all sides. The sounds of the forest seep through the old windows at night, reminding me that I may be isolated but never alone, not really. The woodland sounds are more comforting than anything, because so long as I can hear them, I know I’m safe. \n\nAnyone who's ever grown up camping or found themselves reading Bigfoot or Missing 411 stories knows that the forest is only a threat when everything goes silent. Before recently, there were only two times when the forest had become deafeningly silent at night. The first time was when my father had to put down my first dog, and the second was the night I found my brother’s dead body. \nTonight was the third night in a row where I was awoken by that eerie silence; in the roaring stillness of nighttime. The past two nights I woke up around the same time, about one in the morning, to a silence so dead I could hear my dog’s breath as she slept under my bed. The past two nights were about the same; waking up to seemingly nothing but the strange, empty silence. Both nights I went back to sleep shortly after with no problems. But tonight was different; tonight I felt helpless at the hands of my perception.\nI woke up around 1:30am, earlier than usual, but when I woke up this time it was from blood dripping from my nose and an uncharacteristically dry throat. I rushed to the bathroom to clean up and that’s when I noticed the ticking noise. The only noise in the otherwise quiet and still night. I have analog clocks in my house but I knew this wasn’t them; this ticking was irregular, inconsistent, and coming from the kitchen. \nTck tck.… tck.. tck…. Tck tck… tck.. tck \t\nI was more annoyed than anything, because this ticking noise was so loud, like it was tapping the sides of my brain and forcing me to bury it. I turned from the bathroom and started down the stairs, enclosed in the blindness of the late hour. At the bottom of the stairs, my foot hit something cold and hard… the ticking stopped. I reached my hands out and felt that the cold item was a dining room chair. The dining room table was at least three feet away from the bottom of the stairs; I would know, I navigate this house constantly in the darkness, alone.. The thought of how the chair could have gotten there, when only hours before I had pushed it in after finishing my dinner and went to my room with Ivy, sent a rushing feeling through my stomach. \nI was not alone. Something moved the chair. I froze, only the sound of my uneven breaths and the heartbeat that was pounding in my head, pusling, each beat a fleeting moment of a vulnerable feeling; not knowing your own surroundings in the house you’ve lived in your whole life, not knowing what, or who, could be right in front of you and you’d have no idea. A harsh bark shocked the feeling back into my legs, and I rushed upstairs as fast as my claustrophobic vision would allow.",

It was reported by their waitress, Julie Mitchelle, the couple were having a hostel dinner that included yelling and abrupt banging on the table. Ms. Mitchelle says she had to ask the couple multiple times to keep their voices down. Ms. Mitchelle reports that the couple eventually calmed down and finished their meal quietly, leaving the restaurant around 20:00.\n\nIt is presumed the couple drove straight to their home at 557 Maple Street. At approximately 20:23, a person identifying themselves as Carla Wilson contacted 911 Emergency Services. The operator she spoke to, Phillip Neman, reported that Mrs. Wilson stated in her call that an unknown woman was standing in her driveway. Mr. Neman says he instructed Mrs. Wilson to stay on the line and in her vehicle. During their conversation, Mr. Neman could hear Mrs. Wilson interact with an unidentified male, believed to be Mr. Wilson.\n\nAt approximately 20:26, Mr. Neman reported that Mrs. Wilson screamed. When asked what prompted this, she said that their babysitter, Ms. Rebecca Wells, had come outside and startled them. Mrs. Wilson then stated that the unknown woman was no longer in sight. Mrs. and Mr. Wilson instructed their babysitter to go inside. Mr. Neman said that the Wilsons had a private conversation that Mr. Neman couldn't hear. It was at this point, 20:30, that Mrs. Wilson hung up. Mr. Neman tried calling her back, but no one answered.\n\nThe events that transpired from the ending of the 911 call and when I, Deputy Blackwell, arrived are unknown. I came to the residence of Mr. Steven Wilson and Carla Wilson at 557 Maple Street at approximately 20:37. I exited my cruiser and approached the carport of the Wilson's home, where the intruder was initially reported. On inspection of the driveway, I didn't observe any person or persons as reported to 911. I did observe an unattended vehicle, a 2011 Hyundai Elantra. I noticed the side door to the home was ajar. I announced myself and knocked on the door.\n\nAfter hearing no response, I entered the residence of 557 Maple Street at approximately 20:42. Upon entering the residence, I noticed no lights in the house and removed my flashlight. After activating my flashlight, I shined the light around the home's doorway as I entered the home. I continued shining the light about the house but did not observe any sign of disturbance. I continued my way into the living room, where I witnessed 5 people seated in the living room.\n\nI once again announced myself, but again, received no response. I approached the 5 seated people and announced myself a final time. As I reached the 5 seated persons, I observed two younger males, later identified as Bennet Wilson and Hutton Wilson, and two females, Carla Wilson and Rebecca Wells. The 5th person was Steven Wilson. The 5 people were seated upright with their eyes and mouths open. I attempted to contact any of the 5 people but received no response. I didn't observe any outward wounds or signs of distress on the people. I noticed that, except for Mr. Wilson, none of the other people appeared to be breathing.\n\nAt approximately 20:51, I requested additional emergency services to render aid. After I got off the radio with emergency services, I attempted to contact Mr. Wilson. He seemed non-responsive until I shined my flashlight into his eyes, at which point Mr. Wilson screamed and attacked me.\n\nI was forced to subdue him. Mr. Wilson seemed confused about where he was. He kept asking who I was and where he was. After handcuffing Mr. Wilson, I stood up and noticed the 4 other people were now standing up. Their mouths and eyes were wide open, and their hands were raised defensively. All of them shared the same pose. Mr. Wilson continued to scream, and I asked him to remain silent and to tell his family to sit down. Mr. Wilson insisted his family was upstairs. I told him they were standing around him. Mr. Wilson seemed confused and stated he didn't see them. I tried to make contact with Mrs. Wilson, but she was non-responsive.\n\nI became aware of a presence in the far corner of the room. An older unidentified woman. I cannot confirm if she had always been standing there or had arrived in my subduing of Mr. Wilson. I shined my light on the woman and took a few steps in her direction. She remained in the same static pose as the others. I returned my attention to the Wilson family, who had all collectively turned and were now facing my direction. I removed my taser and instructed them to lie face down. None of them complied. I was unsure of how to proceed in the presence of minors. I backed up to keep the woman and the 4 people in my view. The woman had inched closer in my direction while I had moved my focus to the Wilsons. Since she was separate from the children, I instructed the woman to drop to her knees and put her hand behind her head. Mr. Wilson began screaming that the woman was not human and was a danger. I asked Mr. Wilson to control his outburst and remain silent. The woman refused to comply.\n\nI admit I had reservations about approaching the woman, given the lack of lighting and the unusual nature of the call. I pointed my taser at the woman and gave her a final warning to comply. The woman didn't move, so I fired my taser. It seems to have no effect on the woman. I attempted another electrical surge in the taser, but my flashlight malfunctioned momentarily and went dark. I tapped the light on the wall, and when it came back on, the woman and the 4 people near the sofa had all gotten closer to me. I felt that I was being backed into a corner and attempted to use the taser a third time. My flashlight malfunctioned once again, but when I banged the flashlight against the wall, the light remained off. I dropped the taser and tried to get the flashlight working again. After a few moments, the light came on, and I was face-to-face with the woman. She was a foot from my face.\n\nThe 4 people from the sofa also encircled me. They weren't moving and remained in the same frozen position. I removed my firearm and instructed them to back away. Again, there was non-compliance from the 5 people. I instructed Mr. Wilson to ask his family to step back for safety. Mr. Wilson again insisted no one was in the room with us. I told him to stop playing games if he wanted his family to remain safe. Mr. Wilson became distraught and said it was too late for that. I forcibly shoved the unknown woman away and raised my firearm. The woman didn't budge or react. I demanded she back away. Still no reaction. My flashlight began to flicker. I dreaded what was about to happen. The light went off, and the room went black, but then yellow flashing lights illuminated the house as the ambulance arrived. I see the woman stare right back at me. With every flash of yellow, she seemed to move an inch closer in the darkness until her cold skin touched mine.\n\nThe front door opened, and the lights from the ambulance flooded the house. I was temporally blinded as my eyes adjusted. The EMT, Samantha Wayne, asked me to lower my weapon. I told her I couldn't because of the threat of the people around me. The EMT asked what people? As my eyes adjusted, I could no longer see the woman or the 4 others. I told the EMT to remain outside until the premises could be secured. I again searched the house but could find no sign of the woman, the Wilson family, or the babysitter. Once I determined the house to be secure, I allowed the EMT to come in and examine Mr. Wilson. He had become unresponsive. The EMT took his vitals and said he appeared to be in shock. Mr. Wilson was transported to St. Michaels Hospital. He is under supervision and has currently, as of this time, continued to be non-responsive. The whereabouts of the remaining Wilson family, Ms. Wells, and the unknown woman are still being investigated.",

        "text": "# The events of December 18th 1973\n\nThe year was 1973. I was a clueless man living a nice comfortable life but that would all change on December 18th 1973. I am writing this because I am old and going to die soon and people need to know what I saw that cold winter night. It has been 30 years so I don’t remember all that happened on the day the events took place  so I will fill in the part that I don’t remember with what I think That happened so some parts might be wrong. I was walking on oak street trying to get to my brothers farm in the hills I walked for about 27 minutes and that was when I heard what sound like footsteps so I turned around there was nothing except for a dumpster and a brick wall So I turned back the way I was walking and began to walk again then 2 hours later 1 hour away from his farm I had gotten to a area that was mostly flat with nothing on it not even any trees and heard what I heard before again so I turned around and saw What looked like a man probably 10 foot tall or more with antlers on his head and claws as long as swords probably 20 ft behind me he just stood there until he noticed I saw him. He looked directly In my eyes and smiled with dagger sharp teeth and started running at me as soon as I saw him start to do this I took off running towards my brothers farm I looked back and saw him gaining on me I then looked back In front of me and saw a House 20 feet away from me I got to It and opened the door and got In I saw that a elderly couple lived there. I told them someone was chasing me and asked If I could stay there for the night they agreed and I layed on the couch. But I couldn't go to sleep. There was what sounded like clawing on the door all night. That morning I got up and ran back home and never saw what I thought was a man but now thinking back that could have not been a regular person the years following there were reports of people going missing in that area. If I would have not turned around I would have probably died. I don't know what it was but I don’t want to ever find out.\n\n# Devil hamsters from hamtar\n\nIt was 1994 the day before Halloween when I went to bed I woke up to aloud crash behind my house I grab a coat and a flashlight and went outside and saw a meteor It was twice as big as my head I went back inside and went to bed I woke up at 6 in the morning I saw what I thought was a hamster out of the corner of my eye than I noticed a fire so I put it out I could not find the hamster so I got ready to give candy to kids on Halloween I then started smelling a fire so I looked around and I noticed that the meteor had a button on the side so I pushed It I went to a place that looked like a desert and there was about 20 red hamsters with horns around me they started breathing fire like a dragon trying to kill me I started running and after what felt like hours and I found a river I went In it and the hamsters followed me in and they disappeared when they touched the water I ran back and found a meteor with a button I then appeared in at my house by the meteor and my house had caught on fire the firemen were there and putting it out I told them what happen.   \n\n\n**To be continued**",

This is something I have wanted to say out loud for 43 years now and I know it’s going to feel so good to finally say it to the world.\n\nI hate my fucking bitch daughter. I’ve hated her ever since she was born. I don’t know why I hate her so much. I have 2 daughters and my younger daughter is the most wonderful child a parent could ask for but my oldest daughter is a cunt. I actually hope she dies so I never have to see her again.\n\nI know this sounds mean but I’m not a bad parent. My oldest daughter is an asshole and she deserves to be treated like shit every day. Her father, me, and her own sister all hate her. When she isn’t around we all make fun of her and talk about how pathetic she is. Of course, we are all nice to her when she’s around or when other people are around that we love and care about.\n\nYou know she doesn’t even believe in God! How can I love her if she doesn’t believe in the lord? She’s obviously going to hell so it doesn’t matter if she believes or not. Absolutely nothing will save her ugly soul…but I still try because I am her mother.\n\nThis year I didn’t even buy her or her daughters any Christmas presents. If she doesn’t believe in God, why should she get presents? We also all made it a point to not call her on Christmas to let her know we don’t approve of her lifestyle and the way she’s raising her daughters. We all had a really good Christmas laughing at how stupid she is.\n\nThe one thing that eats at me literally, is my oldest daughter is very beautiful and my younger daughter is fat and not very attractive. My older daughter also has things that other people look at like accomplishments - like she got a bachelors degree from a shitty university,  she was in the military, and she has a lot of work experience. She also has the sweetest daughters anyone could ask for. Her own daughters love her so much and I can’t figure out why. \n\nI was finally getting up the nerve to tell my oldest daughter what a piece of shit she is and the best thing she could do is hand over her daughters to me so I can raise them to be Godly women. I went to her house for the first time in 2 years. I couldn’t call her because I don’t even have her phone number anymore. And that’s when I got the surprise of my life!\n\nMy oldest daughter was laying face down on the kitchen floor, medication was everywhere. She had hives all over her and I saw the epipen she had tried to administer to herself just out of her reach. Both of her daughters were in school. She was having an allergic reaction and she was barely breathing.\n\nShe was going to die thank God - my prayers were answered! Now I can raise her daughters myself and they’ll finally have a chance in life.\n\nBefore I left, I emptied the epipen in the sink just in case she came to. I wiped my prints of it and left. I didn’t call 911 but that’s not really a crime. \n\nToday was going to be a good day. In fact, it was going to be a good life. Surely it won’t take her daughters long to get over her death since she’s such a piece of dog shit.\n\nBesides, her girls will have a better life now. I know I can do a better job of raising them than she tried to do, especially financially.\n\nMy oldest daughter was such an evil person she didn’t deserve to raise her own children. That’s why the good Lord chose to intervene.\n\nThis is what God wants.",

I thought it was just my imagination, but the incidents became more common, and I could not ignore the overwhelming sense of dread anymore.\n\nOne night, as I was trying to rest in my bed, I saw a strange ungodly tall figure standing at the foot of my bed.

We escaped, but just barely, and the horrors we experienced will scar me for life, and I'll never fully recover.  \n\nWhere do I even begin?\n\nMy girlfriend and I were heading home after dinner with my parents.  The weather was worse than terrible, and a travel advisory was all over the news, but we decided to attempt the roads anyway.  \n\n“Be careful,” my dad told us when we left.  “They’re calling for white-out conditions on Highway Six.  If it gets really bad just turn around and come back, okay?”\n\nHe looked nervous, but I reassured him as best as I could.  \n\n“They always say these storms are gonna be bad, but they never really are these days.

The narrow paved highway we were traveling on became more and more snow-covered, and the blowing flurries obscured my vision so that I couldn’t see more than twenty feet in front of the car.  Soon that distance narrowed to fifteen feet, then ten, until the car was moving at a crawling pace and I could no longer determine where the shoulder began or where the road ended.  The ditches had disappeared as well, obscured by a wall of white which extended high into the sky above. \n\n“Stop!  Pull over, you can’t see anything!  You could crash into somebody, or go into a ditch!” my girlfriend Jenny was yelling.  Eventually I listened and pulled over, my heart beating fast as I tried to figure out what to do.  \n\n“Shit.  Well, we can’t just stay here,” I said.  “The car’s gonna get buried in snow.  Then before you know it we’ll run out of gas and have no heat.\"\n\nMy heart was pounding fast in my chest as I tried to decide what to do.  \n\n\"How much is there in the tank?\"\n\n\"It's just above a quarter,\" I told her.  \"Hang on, I’m gonna hop out and take a look around.”\n\n“Be careful,” she said as I opened the door and looked both ways for traffic.  \n\nOn foot I could see that the ditch was just a few inches to the right of where I’d pulled over, and I’d been dangerously close to going into it.  But at least I wasn’t in the middle of the road where a car could come flying through and hit me at any second.  Still, I didn't feel safe.  \n\nI went a few feet forward, trying to determine if there was a house or a gas station nearby where we could stop and pull into a driveway.  It wasn’t good to be at the side of the road like this where someone could come along and crash into us at any second.  Usually I'd be scared to go knocking on a stranger's door, but these were desperate times, and I would have done that in an instant if I'd seen porch lights or something indicating a house nearby.  But there was nothing.  \n\nTerrified of losing the car in the snow, I didn’t dare go more than twenty feet from it, and as soon as the headlights were obscured by white and totally gone I panicked and went back to it, my heart beating even faster than before.  The last thing I wanted to do was lose the vehicle in the blizzard - I’d heard stories of people dying that way.  \n\n“Did you see anything?” Jenny asked as I got back into the car, freezing cold wind and stabbing needles of snow following with me.  \n\n“Nothing.  I’ll try to go forward a bit more.  Maybe if I roll down my window I’ll be able to see better.”\n\nI put the car into drive and stuck my head out the window like a dog, my nose and cheeks freezing in the cold wind and prickling with pins and needles from the snow.  It felt surreal to be driving in this weather, and extremely unsafe.  All I could see was white.  \n\nAfter progressing another thirty feet or so, we came to a standstill again. I got out and walked a few feet before losing the car in the snow, and quickly realized it was hopeless.  Without any way to see the edges of the road or anything ahead of us, we were sure to end up in a ditch.  It was only a matter of time. \n\n“What are we gonna do?” Jenny asked, looking scared.  \n\nI was ready to say something back, when suddenly I saw headlights coming toward us.  They didn't look like regular car headlights.  They were moving slowly, and they were high up and close together.  And the chugging sound that accompanied them reminded me of something that I couldn't place right away.  \n\nLooking up at the vehicle as it pulled to a stop beside our car, I saw a man in a glass box above us that looked alien and unrecognizable in the snow.  And then I realized why.  \n\nIt was a man in a green John Deere tractor.  He was an old farmer in overalls, with a young woman on his lap who looked sixty years younger than him.  I pegged him at about eighty, and guessed she was just shy of her twentieth birthday.  But she had a smile on her face, and looked content.\n\n\"You folks need some help?\" He asked, opening the cabin door.  \n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, opening my own door and getting out.  \"Come on, Jenny.  Maybe we can use their phone to call for help.\"\n\nShe got out and followed after me, and we all crammed into the tractor, which smelled like spent chewing tobacco and body odor mixed with hay.  \n\n\"My place is just over there,\" he said, hooking his thumb over his shoulder from the direction where he came. \"You're welcome to stay with us and wait out the storm.  You can even spend the night if you have to, there's plenty of room.  But I can't promise our phone will be working.  Lost reception when the power went out, maybe an hour ago.\"\n\nI took out my cell phone and saw the cellular network was down too.  Or maybe this was just a dead zone.  \n\n\"Well, we can't thank you enough for helping us,\" I said.  \"We were starting to get really worried.\"\n\nThe man looked grim.\n\n\"Storm like this is nothing to mess around with.  You can wind up in a ditch.  Nobody will find your body for days.  Sometimes not even until the Spring.  And by then they’ll need dental records to identify you.\"\n\nI shuddered involuntarily, looking at the old man with alarm.  No way I would have thought him capable of saying something like that.  But, then again, one thing I’ve learned in my life is that people can be unpredictable.\n\n*\n\nWhen we arrived at the old man's place, I saw it was a large farmhouse with a barn out back.  The details of the property beyond were obscured by snow flurries, but I thought I saw the outlines of a few other buildings as well, and maybe a silo or two.  It was a decent-sized farm, and I imagined at his age he had to have help running it.   \n\nHe took us inside and immediately lit a cigarello, waving out the match and tossing it into a bronze dish full of blackened embers.  Then he led us further into the dimly-lit home, disappearing momentarily around a corner and out of sight.  The young woman hung behind us, locking the door with a key which quietly she pocketed, then regarding us with an odd smile.    \n\nThe house was old and smelled like tobacco smoke and unwashed dogs.  There was a gray haze and a smell of wood fire in the air, as the two of them led us toward a door concealing a short flight of stairs which brought us to the basement.\n\n\"Come on down and join the party,\" he said, and I breathed a sigh of relief to see there was a group of people sitting around the room at the bottom of the stairs.  We wouldn’t be completely alone with this strange man and his oddly-aged partner for the entire night, at least.  \n\n\"I found a couple more stragglers out there,\" our host said, smiling.  \"I'm sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.  I'm Randall Mitchell.  This is my Goddaughter, Lucy.  And these folks are like you, all of them got stuck outside in that nasty storm.\"\n\n\"We're all safe thanks to you, our guardian angel,\" a young woman with a baby said, standing up to give the old man a hug.  \"I don't know how we'll ever be able to repay you for this.\"\n\nThe old man showed his yellow, nicotine-stained teeth.  \n\n\"No repayment necessary, my dear.  I'm just happy I was in a position to help.  We all need each other in this world from time to time.  We need to feed off of each others’ goodness, not deny our basic human nature.\"\n\nThe old man pulled his \"Goddaughter\" in closer, so their hips were touching in a way that made me uncomfortable.  \n\nI saw her put her hand in his back pocket and leave it there as he smiled wider.\n\nThe woman who had been thanking him looked uncomfortable and sat back down without another word.  She stared at her lap, looking deep in thought and slightly worried all of a sudden.\n\n\"Now, who wants hot chocolate?  I know you two do.”\n\nJenny and I couldn’t help but nod.  We were both still freezing from the outdoors, and a cup of steaming hot cocoa sounded like just what the doctor ordered.  \n\n*\n\nWe introduced ourselves to the other people in the basement while we waited for Randall and Lucy to return with the hot chocolate.  One by one they explained how they had been driving on the road and the blizzard had caused them to stop.  Luckily Randall had just happened past and saved them.  One by one.  \n\nConversation slowly died down again and an awkward silence ensued.  \n\n“What’s wrong?” Jenny asked, and I realized I was staring vacantly off into the nearest wall.  It was a bad habit I had when I was thinking about something.  \n\nAt that moment, I was thinking about all those cars on the road.  Why hadn’t we seen any of them?  We’d left ours at the side of the road, but I hadn’t seen any others before or after we stopped.  It was possible I had missed them in the snow…  But I doubted it.  \n\nI was about to ask the man sitting closest to me, named Bill, what he had done with his vehicle, but then Randall returned with Lucy and there was no opportunity.  Setting my concerns aside, I decided I was being paranoid.  There was probably more opportunity to get the other vehicles off the road before we arrived.  There was no sense making a scene by questioning people about it.  \n\nStill, I didn’t drink the hot chocolate.  I didn’t trust it.  And neither did Jenny.  \n\nWe went to bed early and a few of us slept on the floor.  There were enough blankets and pillows thanks to Randall and Lucy, who offered us water and told us where the bathroom was in case we needed it.  \n\nLying on the floor next to Jenny, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep, telling myself I was being paranoid.  These were good people.  They had helped us.  \n\nI fell into a deep slumber much quicker than usual.  \n\nBut my dreams were not pleasant.  \n\n*\n\nWhen I awoke it was still the middle of the night.  \n\nI heard a sound from a room nearby.  A dull, rhythmic, knocking.  Like someone behind a door, insisting on being let in.  \n\nOr, let OUT.  \n\nClosing my eyes, I tried desperately to ignore it.  But it didn’t stop for a long, long time.  \n\n*\n\nAt some point I must have fallen back asleep, because I opened my eyes to see that it was morning.  The sun was shining through a small gap above the snow in the high windows above us, letting in just enough light to wake us up.  \n\nLooking around I noticed with a surreal sense of horror that we were alone.\n\nAll of the other people who had been in the basement the night prior, and who had been sleeping around us, were gone.  \n\nThe woman named Barbara and her child.  Bill and his family and the couple who had been sitting in the corner. \n\nI elbowed Jenny and asked her if she saw anyone leave.  \n\n“No,” she said.  “I wonder what happened to them.”\n\nMy heart was beating quickly in my chest and I rose to my feet, wondering what would happen if we tried the door leading back up to the main level.  Would it be locked?  \n\nThe burnt-bacon smell of breakfast was in the air and I realized I was starving.  \n\n“Maybe they’re already awake,” Jenny said.  “Smells like someone’s making food.”\n\nWe went upstairs and found Randall was in the kitchen at the table, reading his newspaper.  But nobody was cooking breakfast.\n\nAnd there was no sign of the others.  \n\n“Morning, folks,” Randall said, looking up from his paper.  “We sure did get hit hard last night.  Paper boy didn’t make it, I’m afraid.  This is yesterday’s news!”\n\nThe old man had a smile on his face that I couldn’t help but return, despite the unsettling situation.   \n\n“Thanks,” I said, taking a seat.  “How much did we end up getting?”\n\n“More than six feet.  And it’s still coming!  I can’t even get the front door open.”\n\nI felt a heavy weight like cement sitting in my stomach, thinking about the fact that we were trapped in here with this man.  But he was so friendly and unassuming.  Not to mention, by the looks of him, he was eighty years old!  Why the hell was I so suspicious of him?  My gut was telling me something was wrong, and I always trusted my gut.  \n\n“What happened to everyone?” I asked, and the question came out sounding much harsher and more accusatory than I intended.  I lowered my gaze when Randall looked at me with his cold blue eyes, unflinching.  \n\n“Oh, did they leave?  They must have escaped before the door got blocked.  Didn’t even realize they were gone.”\n\nJenny softened the mood by speaking up in a friendly voice.  \n\n“It smells good in here.”\n\nHis head snapped around to look at her.  \n\n“Does it?” he asked.  \n\n“Yeah.  Did you already have breakfast?”\n\n“No.”\n\nAn awkward silence hung over the three of us.  It definitely smelled like someone had been cooking meat.  Finally, Jenny broke the quiet by speaking up again.  \n\n“Oh.  Well, if the four of us are gonna be stuck here, maybe we can work out some sort of arrangement.  Do you have enough to eat, so we can make something for ourselves?  We can reimburse you for the cost.”\n\nThe old man smiled.  \n\n“I might have something that will satisfy you.”\n\nHis grin grew even wider and he turned his gaze to look at me.  \n\n“And you?  Are you hungry?  Can I get you something as well?”\n\nDespite how creepy all of this was getting, I was famished.  And I had to eat something.  So I nodded my head, feeling like I was making a deal with the devil for some reason.  \n\n*\n\nAfter nearly an hour of waiting in the dining room, Randall finally emerged from the kitchen with a steaming tray in hand.  He presented us with a plate of meat, dripping with bloody juices. \n\n“Sorry it took so long,” he said.  “I had to do some butchery on these steaks.  It’s worth the trouble, though.  You wouldn’t believe how much cheaper it is when you acquire these things in bulk.  I never go to the grocery store anymore.  If you saw how much money I’ve been saving you’d see why.  It’s like highway robbery.”\n\nHe put the steaks on plates for us, and we began to eat.  There was a pool of red liquid sitting puddled in the center of my dish, looking very red and bloody, and I wondered just how undercooked the steak was going to be.  I’d always been a medium sort of guy myself, pink but not bloody. \n\n“Lucy!  Breakfast!”\n\nThe old man called out.\n\nHis goddaughter came downstairs a minute later, looking surprised to see us there.  \n\n“Oh,” she said, fiddling with her hair.  “Are they gonna… They’re staying with us?”\n\nThis struck me as odd, since she’d been there when he’d invited us to spend the night.  But now she was acting clueless about it.  Like she was expecting us to have left like the others, despite the fact that we were snowed in.  \n\n“The door’s blocked, Lucy,” Randall said.  “Now eat your steak.”\n\nShe sat down with a moody sigh and started cutting into the piece of meat in front of her, casting awkward glances in our direction from time to time.  \n\n“You two can stay for no charge today,” Randall said suddenly.  “But if the snow keeps up and you’re stuck in here for another night, I’ll expect some payment for room and board.”\n\nJenny looked up at me nervously, but I quickly agreed.  \n\n“That’s fair.  We don’t have much cash on us, though.  You know how it is these days, debit and credit everywhere.”\n\n“If you don’t have the money, you can work off the debt.  I’m always looking for help around the farm.  And we’ve got plenty of livestock to take care of.”\n\nI nodded, thinking I had guessed right when I’d looked at the other farm buildings out back.  The man definitely needed help around this huge place, and I wasn’t opposed to chipping in to pay back the debt of staying and eating his food.  Especially if we were gonna be stuck inside anyways.\n\n“Sure.  What did you have in mind?” \n\n“Nothing much, just a few hours of feeding the animals, changing the hay, that sort of thing.  It’ll keep you busy if we keep getting more of this snow!  You’re gonna be getting pretty bored by tomorrow afternoon around here.  No cable TV and no internet.”\n\n“How would we get out there?  I thought we’re snowed in?”\n\n“There’s a door in the basement that leads through a tunnel to the barns.  And they’re all connected.  I had it built so we could get out there in case of a storm like this.  Up in this area we used to get them all the time, although not so much anymore.”\n\n“Global warming,” I said, nodding.  \n\nThe man scowled and shook his head.  \n\n“The next ice age is coming.  You’ll see.  Back in the seventies they said the world was gonna freeze over like it did when the Woolie Mammoths were roaming around, now they talk about global warming.  It’s all horseshit.  The temperature goes up and down, that’s all there is to it.  We’ve got no control over it.”\n\nI knew better than to argue with the guy after he’d taken us in from the weather, and just nodded my head, thinking to myself, The weather will clear up by tomorrow.  It has to.\n\n*\n\nThat day passed by uneventfully and pretty soon it was dark outside again.  With no WIFI and no television, there wasn’t much to do around the farmhouse, but at least it was warm and there was food to go around for the four of us.  Even if every meal was a very rare steak that tasted a little funny.  \n\nJenny and I went to bed early and tried to sleep, but I could tell she was tossing and turning just as much as I was.  Something about this house, and about this situation, was very wrong.  Everything about it felt OFF.  \n\nAround midnight, I decided to try the door leading outside for myself, to see if it would open again.  I walked over to it and opened the screen door as quietly as I could, then turned the door handle, pushing against the wood with all of my body weight.  I imagined the others who had been in the basement with us doing the same thing and getting out before first light, running to their cars and gunning the engines, racing away from this place.  \n\nMaybe they’d known something was wrong with the old man too.  And the more I thought about it, the more I didn’t want to find out what it would be like working for him, despite my earlier promises.  \n\nThe door wouldn’t budge.  But it didn’t feel like snow blocking it on the other side.  It felt like a lock.  As if someone had put a deadbolt on the thing which could only be accessed from the exterior.  The bulk of the door wiggled a fraction of an inch but no further each time I pushed against it.  It was like we were locked in.  \n\nJenny was sitting upright, watching me in the darkness from where she’d been sleeping.  \n\n“What’s wrong?” she asked.  And I was surprised at her insight into my emotions judging just by my body language in the dark room.  \n\n“Don’t freak out.  I can’t be sure.  But, I think it’s locked from the outside,” I whispered, walking back over to her.  \n\nShe gripped my arm with a cold hand and squeezed my bicep with her fingers digging in painfully.  \n\n“What do you mean, from the outside?”\n\n“I’m not sure… But it doesn’t feel like snow to me.  Something’s wrong here, can’t you feel it?  I’m just getting this vibe that we need to get out.  Now.  Tonight.  Before the sun comes up and we’re stuck here for another day, maybe longer.”\n\nIt was hard to see much through the narrow gaps of the windows high in the room, since they were mostly covered with snow.  We had no idea what it really looked like outside.  \n\n“Here, let me boost you up so you can look out the window,” I said, pointing at one nearby.  \n\nWe went over to it and stood below it.  I put my hands out in front of me and made a step for Jenny to put her foot on.  \n\nLooking up again at the window, my heart skipped a beat.  \n\nA face was pressed up against the glass, looking in at us.  Eyes that were black as night watched us, hands held up at the sides of the face to block the glare of light outside.  \n\n“Fuck,” I shrieked involuntarily.  \n\nJenny saw it too and the two of us backed away from the window, moving toward our bunks.  We got in and laid back down beneath the covers, like children caught awake in the night past our bedtimes.\n\nA second later, the face disappeared.  \n\nThe whole thing was unsettling, but more than anything, it proved I was right.  There was someone outside, which meant it was possible to get outside.  The weather had improved, and the old man was keeping us trapped here as prisoners.  \n\n“We need to get out of here,” I said to Jenny after we were sure the face in the window was gone.  \n\n“But how?”\n\nAs if to answer the question, a banging sound came from somewhere, just the same as it had the night before.  It was a hollow, metallic sound, somehow sad and lonely in its resonance.  \n\n“What is that?” Jenny asked, gripping my hand tightly.  \n\n“I don’t know,” I whispered.  “I heard it last night too.”\n\nCLANG, CLANG, CLANG\n\nThe noise continued, steady and rhythmic, the same pace and frequency as the night before.  \n\nWith a weary glance up at the window, the two of us began to look around, hoping if we could find the source of the sound, it might somehow lead to a way out as well.  \n\nCLANG, CLANG, CLANG\n\nIt was getting louder as we got closer to the rear of the basement, and as I explored to either side I found it became softer and harder to hear.  \n\nA large mirror was set up at one end of the room we were in, and I tried to move it aside.  Surprisingly, it slid to the right with ease, as if it were on a sliding set of rails.  \n\nBehind it was a weathered door, covered with flaking red paint which resembled the color of congealing blood in the darkness of the basement.  \n\nI took a glance at Jenny and she locked eyes with me.  I could see she was shaking, and noticed that I was too, as I raised my hand and grabbed the door knob.  Despite our fear, she nodded her head and I turned the knob, and we looked through the threshold at what lay beyond.  \n\n*\n\nThe corridor smelled like hay and manure, the familiar smells of agriculture which indicated this passageway led to a barn.  \n\nRemembering Randall’s words, I decided this must be the underground tunnel which led to the other farm buildings.  It stood to reason that it would lead to other exits as well.  \n\nWe’d finally found our way out.  \n\n“I don’t like this,” Jenny said.  “It feels too easy.”\n\nI hoped she was wrong about that.  But I was getting a similar sensation.  Especially after seeing the eyes looking in at us through the window.  If they saw we were missing, they’d quickly find out where we went.  \n\nStill, what was I scared of?  An old man and his daughter?  I could take him if I had to, I thought to myself.  \n\nAs long as he doesn’t have a gun, a skeptical voice in my mind said.  Or he could have help.  You saw the face in the window, and it didn’t look like him.  And you said for yourself there had to be more people working on this farm.\n\nI was more and more scared with each step we took down the long tunnel, and I noticed it was getting colder as well.\n\nFinally we emerged into a dimly lit barn.  The two of us ducked down behind a wall and watched around the corner as a worker entered the large space.  \n\nHay was all over the floor and I assumed this was an area which contained animals - thus explaining the hay and manure.  The man was carrying what looked like a bag of feed, and he dumped it into a trough at the center of the large space.  \n\n“Alright,” he called out, removing a pistol from a holster attached to his belt.  “Dinner time, piggies!”\n\nPeople began to emerge from the cages and pens I’d presumed were meant for farm animals.  Instead of cows and pigs, men and women emerged from each one.  They were teary-eyed and some were weeping. \n\nAs they got down on their hands and knees to eat the slop they'd been given, I noticed something even more horrifying.  \n\nThe people were missing pieces of themselves.  Arms and legs, and various other parts had been shaved off of them, the wounds half-healed in some cases and covered with bloody bandages.\n\n\"Oh my God…\" Jenny whispered from beside me, gripping my arm tightly.  She was seeing the same thing I was.  \n\nThe old man's words came back to me, from when we had been sitting around his breakfast table.\n\nSorry it took so long… I had to do some butchery on these steaks...  \n\nYou wouldn’t believe how much cheaper it is when you acquire these things in bulk...  \n\nI never go to the grocery store anymore.  If you saw how much money I’ve been saving you’d see why…\n\nIt’s like highway robbery…\n\nThe whole time he'd been laughing about it in our faces.  He was collecting people at the side of the road… \n\nAnd eating them.\n\nMaybe he was in some sort of twisted cult or secret society.  I’d heard rumors of such people existing.  Online forums where cannibalism was discussed in great detail.  I’d even heard there was a name for it - Zambian Meat.  \n\nI began to gag as the realization settled in, and I thought about the implications.\n\n\"Jenny…. The steaks…\"\n\nShe covered her mouth with her hand, trembling as she whispered back to me.\n\n\"Jesus.  He fed us fucking people, Jason.\"\n\nI couldn’t help it, I threw up involuntarily, and Jenny did as well, just as the worker was leaving the barn, going out through a door which looked to lead outside.  \n\nAfter several moments of retching and coughing up bile as quietly as we could, we gathered our wits again.  \n\n“There,” I said, pointing at the exit.  “That’s gotta be the way out.  Come on, let’s go.  We’ll get the police and come back for these people.”\n\nThe two of us took one last look around the barn for any signs of guards and began to run towards the exit.  \n\nInstantly, I realized our mistake.  \n\nThe people there were so desperate to get out, so afraid of the situation they were in, that as soon as they saw us, they began to scream for help.  \n\n“We’re saved!” a woman yelled.  \n\n“Jason, Jenny!” Bill, the man from the night prior, was seen at the trough.  He was now missing a leg and hobbled over to us, falling to the ground hard at one point and then crawling, grasping the straw-covered floor with his hands as he dragged himself the rest of the way on his belly.  \n\nBefore I knew it, the man was holding onto my leg, weeping like a child.  \n\n“You have to get us out.  You have to help us!” he screamed, over and over again.  \n\nThere were thick chains attached to ankle bracelets that held each one of them, preventing them from escaping the barn.  But they didn’t think about that detail as they wailed and cried, begging us to let them out, to take them with us.  \n\n“We’re going to get help!  You have to let us go!” I tried to reason with them, but they were no longer thinking properly.  \n\n“The hot chocolate!” Bill was yelling now.  “Don’t drink the hot chocolate!”\n\nFootsteps could be heard outside and Jenny and I quickly realized the worker was returning.  My heart jackhammering in my chest, I kicked my leg out of Bill’s grasp.  He scrambled after us as we raced out of the room, heading for the door which I assumed led into another barn beside this one.  \n\nA second after we left the barn, I heard the door open and the worker was in the doorway, yelling, “Shut up and eat your slop!  We ain’t lettin’ you outta here so quit asking!”\n\nHe was quiet suddenly and I wondered if he sensed something was off.  The group of prisoners were still making a lot of noise, asking to be let go, talking to us even though we were no longer in the room.  I wondered how long a few of them had been kept here, and if they had gone completely mad by this point.  \n\nCLANG, CLANG, CLANG\n\nThe sound we’d been hearing from the basement was much louder now, and I looked around at the new space we were in, seeing it was not a barn, but a butcher room.  Blood stains were on the floor and spattered the walls.  There were drains at the center of the area and the smooth floors sloped toward them, to funnel blood away from stainless steel tables where the gruesome work was done.  Hair and pieces of bone and flesh were lying on the ground in places, but the tables had been meticulously cleaned and polished.  \n\nGiant chest freezers and refrigerators were arranged along one wall.  Hooks were hanging from the ceiling on a conveyor belt which brought carcasses to and from another room.  It was quite cold in here, I noticed, and when I breathed out I could see a puff of fog escaping my lungs. \n\nCLANG, CLANG, CLANG\n\nThe sound came again, and this time it was from one specific fridge, which I noticed was rattling back and forth each time the noise was made.\n\nDespite my fear and desire to escape, I found myself drawn to the fridge.  On wobbly legs I wandered to it and stood in front of it, breathing deeply and taking in the coppery-smelling air.  \n\n“We need to get out of here,” Jenny said urgently.  But I knew it was pointless.  There was no other way out.   \n\nMy entire body was trembling as I gripped the fridge door handle and prepared myself for what was inside.  \n\nI opened it and felt my skin turn ice cold.  \n\nThe man inside the fridge was still alive, but just barely.  His skin was turning blue.  His lips were chapped, broken, and frost-covered.  His arms and legs had been removed, the stumps cauterized with a hot brand.  \n\nHe opened his mouth to scream and I saw he had no tongue.  All he could do to call for help was what he had been doing.  \n\nWith as much force as he could muster, he banged his head hard against the inside of the fridge, hitting his forehead where a black, swollen bruise had developed.  \n\nCLANG, CLANG, CLANG!\n\nAnd then he mouthed the words which I could easily make out, despite the fact that I didn’t know how to read lips.  \n\nThere were only two of them, and they were plain enough to see, and easy enough to guess considering the situation.  \n\n“Kill me,” the man in the fridge said without sound. \n\nAnd then the door crashed in behind us.  \n\nThe worker entered the room and we were still hidden behind a large cabinet, but just barely.  \n\nThere was only one place to go.  Only one place to hide.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I crammed ourselves into the refrigerator, taking up residence with the man inside, and I pulled the door closed, hoping no one had seen us enter.  \n\nWe held our collective breath, and even the man in there with us did the same, as if hoping maybe with our help he could still be free of this place.\n\nIt was freezing cold inside the fridge.  Unbearable.  My skin began to feel as if it were being stabbed with pins and needles as I tried to adjust my body weight to get more comfortable.  But it was impossible.  \n\nThere wasn’t an inch of extra room.  It felt like I couldn’t breath, as if I were suffocating, as if my lungs were turning into ice.  \n\nAnd then footsteps could be heard from just outside, and I dared not move an inch.  \n\nRaspy breathing sounds, and then a cough echoed, and then the door opened and I saw Randall outside with the worker who had been looking for us.  Lucy was with them, and all three had pistols and shotguns pointed in our direction.  If we moved an inch, I had no doubt they would use them.  These people would not hesitate to kill us.  \n\nThe old man held a large caliber pistol in one hand, and in the other he had a cigarillo.  He put it to his lips and took a puff, smiling at us.  Then he breathed out a frosty plume of smoke and began to laugh.  \n\n“You know, I offered the two of you a job for a reason.  You looked like hard workers.”\n\nHe let out a sigh.  \n\n“But if you’d prefer to be meat…  Well, we can make that happen too.  We’re always in need.  After all, Mitchell’s Zambian Meat goes out all over the world.  We’re a very popular supplier in our niche demographic.  And we always need more inventory.”\n\nI tried to protest, to tell him we’d do what he asked, we’d do anything, but all I could do was chatter my teeth as I tried to form a sentence.  \n\nA second later the door was closed and we were left in darkness again.  In the cold.  Unable to move, just like if we’d gone into a ditch during that storm and been buried in the snow.\n\nNobody will find you until the Spring.  And by then, they’ll need dental records to identify you.  \n\nI was starting to think we would have been better off in the ditch, when another one of Randall's workers surprised us by opening the fridge door again an hour later.  We could barely move by that point, our fingers and toes numb with frostbite, but we managed to crawl out onto the floor.  \n\nAfter warming up enough to speak, I thanked the man, but he didn't answer.  When he opened his mouth, I saw he had no tongue.  \n\nHe simply motioned to the door, and to the exit, and watched passively as we escaped into the frozen winter air, running for miles in our bare feet until we found a town far away from that house.  I didn't trust anyone living nearby.  \n\nI didn't trust anyone ever again.  \n\nAll I can see now when I look at other people, even Jenny, is Randall Mitchell, sitting at that dining room table cutting up a bloody steak and putting pieces of it in his mouth.  \n\nIt's like highway [robbery…](https://youtu.be/7Fz62mJsg7c)\n\n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/raq7ay/all_stories_20212022/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)  \n\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

        "text": " [Greg Robinson's Logs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10uhs9u/deep_dive_experiment_logs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n LOG 1: May 6, 2022\n\n Condition: Good\n\n\n Hello again. It's Scientist Mark Lion. I am now in the tank on the exact same day the prisoners were in. Before the second trial of this experiment me and a couple of colleagues who are also doing this with me studied the original experiment. We made sure for them to put us in the same places of the 3 prisoners that disappeared. Oh? Your also wanting to know what happened to the other two? Well they died. A human being can only go 3 days without eating and two days without water. So me and my colleagues decided that the disappearances of the other 3 were selective. I told my wife and son that i will be gone for a few days. That is a lie. If I don't find out the cause that made Greg Robinson and the others disappear I'll surely die of either dehydration or starvation. I took Robinson's advice and worked out while I am down here. Felt good. Well that will be all for today's log. Logging out. \n\n\n LOG 2: May 6, 2022\n\n Condition: Good\n\n\n It is now my second day. Mostly all I did was listen to yesterday's log and stared out into the ocean. The wildlife running about out there makes you feel almost trapped in here. I worked out again. Felt the burn in my muscles. After tomorrow I'll take a rest day. Which i learned from a fitness coach. Hope you won your basketball game today son. I didn't forget it. Love you Cheri. I love you both. Logging out. \n\n\n LOG 3: May 7, 2022\n\n Condition: Good\n\n\n Cheri I saw a whale! It was enormous! I mean I know what a whale is but I never saw one this close! The tail brushed against the tank but other than that I'm fine! Did the workout today. Now I am feeling sore. Jamar I hope you are doing your chores and helping your mother. Logging out. \n\n\n LOG 4: May 8, 2022\n\n Condition: Medium\n\n\n Doing nothing for rest sure doesn't make me feel good. I'm also running out of supplies. That means after tomorrow I'm gonna be preparing myself to die. It is what I should do anyway. We killed them prisoners. I know they are bad people but still they are human beings just the same. Just like Robinson I only see the dark depths. I'm not afraid though. This means that there is nothing to distract me. I love you my wife and son. Logging out.\n\n\n LOG 5: May 9, 2022\n\n Condition: Medium\n\n\n It is now the 5th day. I will be eating the last of my rations today as well. If the audio logs stop that means I will probably be dead. This will be hells punishment on me. I'm sure the other two scientists are thinking the same thing. I will pray for my forgiveness throughout these upcoming terrible days. I love my family. I hope you thrive and prosperity when i am gone. I also exercised today. Well I'm logging off. \n\n\n LOG 6: May 10, 2022\n\n Conditions: Medium\n\n\n Signs of hunger are already starting to all me. Can't hardly finished the exercises today. I'm just reliving my family memories. Sitting in and watching the darkened waters outside sure doesn't help. Well I'm going to log out. \n\n\n LOG 7: May 11, 2022\n\n Condition: Bad\n\n\n Oh god the hunger. My stomach is killing me. It is now the 7th day. All I did was lay down because of the stomach pains. I know your thinking why not I just call this thing off? Well it's because I was the one that recommended Robinson. Just like how the other two recommended the others. It's an act of self clarity. An act of self rightous judgment. Again to my family i love you and you all mean the world to me. \n\n\n LOG 8: May 12, 2022\n\n Condition: Medium\n\n\n Oh my god I heard them! I heard the voices! While I was sure to die of hunger and dehydration the voices talked to me! I thought that maybe it was just me going crazy but it reassured me I wasn't! I asked the voices what it was and it said it will reveal itself to me once I follow the same steps the inmates did. Oh my god Cheri I'll be with you and our son again soon! I love you both very very much! Logging out!\n\n\n LOG 9: May 13, 2022\n\n Condition: Medium\n\n\n Alright I did it! I did what it asked me to do! I don't care about the loss of blood though. It congratulated me when i finished! It has been half an hour now. Wait, I hear it talking to me again! It says that it knows I was one of the people that brought the others down here. They said that they don't know how we found it. But it is thanking me for the meal. Meal? Does it think I am food? Oh my god what is happening! No please no not like this! My skin is dissolving right in front me! There is no pain. I'm glad of that but I don't want to be food! I want to be with my family! Oh god now it's got all my arm gone! Please if you all hear this please tell my wife and my son! Tell them not to go near the ocean oh god! Now my whole right side is gone! Please god have mercy….! \n\n\n *******************************************\n\n\n I open my mouth in horror as my dad's screams filled the room until the audio cuts off. I look at the lawyer in front of me. \n\n\n \"Are you serious? This is how my dad \"died\"? \n\n\n The layer with a stern and serious face nods his head at me. \"Whenever they pulled your father out of the ocean he wasn't in the tank.\" \n\n\n I still didn't believe him. \"Are you sure your telling me everything that happened?\" \n\n\n Again with that stern look he shakes his head as he gets up. \"You don't have to believe it if you don't want to, you can tell other people because they won't believe it. All we know is that your dad along with the scientists and death row inmates were never found even with an underwater drone search.\" \n\n\n I fall back in my chair in disbelief. \n\n\n \"Don't think that your dad left you nothing. All the money he left you two was to pay for your mother's cancer treatments. I done told her in the hospital this morning before I came to you.\" He then starts to head out towards the front door. \n\n\n I run up to him and grabbed his shoulder. \"What did she say?\" I already felt the burn of tears in my eyes. \n\n\n He then looks back at me. He then smiled and said,\"your mother just smiled and looked up at the roof and said that she hopes Mr. Lion's didn't suffer and that hopefully she will be with him soon\". He then opened the door and left as I watched him get into his black car and drove away. \n\n\n To all of you who hoped that my father was doing well I am afraid to inform you he is not with us. All I know is that we should take his dying wishes and know that we shouldn't never go in the ocean. \n\n \n\n [For I fear what creatures are down there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lingeringshadows/comments/10xxb6p/deep_dive_experiment_logs_final/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n ",

        "text": "*Did you know that all angels have a hard shell?*\n\nDespite their humanoid appearance, angels lack the softness and pudginess we have on the outside. \n\nWhen meeting one, the first thing you'd notice is how pue they look. Pale and unblemished, even the finest porcelain china could never compare. Then you'd notice the rigidness of their features, as if the dips beneath their brows were etched, dim eyes slotted in and noses sculpted. \n\nYou'd also notice their lips, stretched into a smile and seemingly held in place by some invisible wire. They'd look soft and welcoming, but you'd find out that they were cold to the touch and nothing but. \n\n*Have you ever seen how a cone snail eats?*\n\nIf I had to compare an angel to another hard shelled creature, I would compare it to a cone snail. As beautiful as they are, they are both viscous and deadly. \n\nUnlike many snail species, cone snails have a proboscis, or an extended feeding tube as you might call it. Attached to the tip of proboscis is a modified tooth, packed with enough venom to paralyze and kill their prey. They use this to repeatedly jab their prey when hunting for food. \n\nAngels are not much different, I've come to find. When an angel attacks, its non-existent jaw seems to unhinge, turning its perpetual smile into a gaping maw within a split second. When this happens, you'd hear a cacophony of noises,-- a simultaneous mix of trumphets, nails scraping against metal and babies' laughter. If you're distracted by the sound, even for just a moment, the angel's fleshy feeding tube would introduce you to a quick death. \n\nThat almost happened to me once, but I was quick to dodge. Despite the horrid thing barely grazing my cheek, I was in agony for seemed like an eternity. \n\nThough, I suppose God decided it was too soon for me to start paying for my sins. \n\n*How do you enjoy your snails for dinner?*\n\nIn the western world, these delicacies are often slathered in sauces and eaten with a fork. While I too enjoy my snails this way, the best experience I've had when eating snails was in a crowded Southeast Asian alleyway. The vendor had merely boiled the snails in large pot while they were still shelled and alive. He then scooped them up into a paper cup and handed them to me, motioning for me to suck them straight out of the shell. And so, I slurped them out, savouring them as their juices flowed into my mouth and hijacked all my sense. \n\nIt was filling, and it was delicious. \n\nI suppose I get the same thrill with what I do now. As I pry open the angel's lips with a pair of metal pliers, it weakly struggles against the chains attached to the basement wall. Despite the numerous beatings it had sustained, its hard skin shows no sign of bruises or injuries. But just as I wanted, it's finally gotten to a point where it's too weak to attack me now.\n\n Like snails, angels are soft on the inside. So with one hand, I hold a kettle and begin pouring its boiling contents into the angel's mouth. \n\nThe angel is thrashing on the ground now, my foot pinning it down. The wails it lets out no longer disturbs me, but plays a tune that's music to my ears— church bells, funeral marches and the loud crackle of flames. \n\nI am done when the angel stops writhing and gently press my lips onto its.\n\n*I begin to suck.* \n\n*Bon Appétit.*",

        "text": "My old house was a queen Anne Victorian style, three levels, built from the ground up in my early childhood years! We had all the room to wander, goof around and have the best childhood any kid could ask for! We never delved into ACTUALLY investigating the whole house, but when I was 19, that urge to explore the unknown in the house kicked in, and oh boy did it ever give me the chills!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, when I was home alone, I got the sudden urge to just explore! You know that feeling when you know something needs to be found, but you don't know what, well that hit me like a ton of bricks! I didn't know what I would find, but what I did find and experience, will change your perspective on things you never know about, meaning time travel, and dreaming!\n\nIt was a hot summer day, and I was home alone! Mom and dad were out on a camping trip for a few weeks and they left me with guarding the house! Ironic, but knowing I had to work during the time they were gone, they left me to it! Dad built this house, board by board, brick by brick and tile by tile with help when I was a toddler in 1989! I knew he did, because I still get to see those pictures! But what he DIDNT tell me, Im surely going to give him hell for it!\n\nDuring the afternoon, I went into the attic to look for something my mother told me to go after! I made my way up the stairs, and the whole attic, mind you, was full of stuff my mom keeps for special events and other storage! I found myself looking over EVERYTHING, because I love to see where mom keeps stuff knowing I know nothing about where things are!\n\nI was looking over one shelf when I saw a unknown door!\n\n\"Thats odd\" I said to myself, \"never seen that door before!\"\n\nI climbed over the shelf and approached it!! It was smaller than a normal door, and it was tucked into the side of the room! I grabbed the handle and got an instant shock of adrenaline! You know that feeling when you expect something to happen, that's the feeling! I opened the door to darkness and nothing happened!\n\nI shrugged it off and went back to what I was looking for! I found the prize and went back downstairs and enjoyed the rest of the day! Mom called and told me that I should expect them tomorrow afternoon and asked if I could prepare dinner for that evening! I gladly obliged\n\nThat evening, I went back to the attic to investigate the door a little more and see how long it had been there! Thats when everything changed. I climbed the stairs to the attic and saw a faint light coming out. I slowly opened the attic door and saw the light coming from the unknown door and made my way cautiously to it! I was just about to open it when a blast of hot air it me and I was out.\n\nI came to in a field in bright sunlight, and I looked around to see where I was. Thats when I saw a HUGE castle standing in front of me! Medieval looking and ominous, I knew I had just time travelled back into the age of swords and mystical beings! I heard a sound come from behind me and I swung around to see a man on a horse, all dressed in clothing, circa 1200s!\n\n\"Hello there, you are an odd fellow!\" He said, in a very old English Accent. \"Do you know your way?\"\n\n\"No', I said, stuttering a bit\n\n\"Lets take you to the high king and see what he makes of you!\" as he grabbed me forcefully to my feet!\n\nWe made our way into the castle and there before me was the biggest and most decorated room I've ever seen! Colors of all kinds and just jeweled with riches no one could imagine!\n\n\"My lord, I have brought to you a lonely traveler! He is not known to these parts! I found him in the field near the moat!\" He said as people gathered around to study me.\n\n\"Ah, someone who is foreign to us needs to be heard!\" The king said, standing up \"who are you strange fellow?? Where does one live!\"\n\n\"Im sorry your royal majesty, I'm not from this realm! I am a figure from distant years!\" I said, looking directly at him\n\n\"Distant years??\" He said Shockingly, \"tell me, young one, what years are you from?\"\n\n\"I'm from the time of cars and rifles! Times to where you need no one to fight for anything except for honor and pride!\" I said with great pride, \"I don't know how you will take this your majesty, but I'm a time traveler! I'm from future years!\"\n\nJust then everyone around me took a step back as the king made his way to me, scowling and trying to make sense of me!\n\n\"Future? Time Travel? Dear boy, we have never heard of such things! Until we get to the bottom of all this ruckus, we might need to put you in the dungeon! UNLESS, you show us great power from this future realm, we will grant you pardon and I'll make you a part of my high court!\" He looked at me angrily, waiting for my reply\n\n\"I would be honored your majesty!! Your wish is my command!\" I said, holding my head high, wondering what I got myself into.\n\nThe next thing I know I was being led into this courtyard where there was three men lined up, blind folded, on their knees with cloaked figures holding on to them!\n\n\"You will do this execution deed, this will show if you are from the time you say! Pick your weapon dear friend!!\" He said with a smirky smile\n\nI had to do as he said or my head would be next. I looked over the choice of weaponry, and saw what I was good at, archery! So I grabbed the arrow and bow and proceeded to wait for his command for the event!!!\n\n\"Ok strange fellow, make your due haste and show us your power!\" \n\nI made my stand directly angled next to one of the men and had them all lined up in my sights! I had to line them up like I was getting three deers at once, not missing the spot I needed to line. I pulled back on the bow and counted to three, releasing the arrow and the crack of it hitting the first gentleman resonated through the whole courtyard then they all fell, the last man having the arrow straight through his brain, blood hemorrhaging out of this mouth and head.\n\n\"My heavens, dear friend that was the best shot of an arrow I've seen in ages! What is your name young man!\" I noticed he was holding back tears as he looked into my eyes\n\n\"I would like to keep my name anonymous your majesty! I'll hold that true and you have my word on keeping this bow and arrow next to me!\" I said, dreading my words\n\nThe next day was my worst challenge! I woke up in this dream or whatever it was called to several knights needing me to come out side and help!\n\nI get outside and see the whole castle is under attack! I grab my bow and arrow and start shooting! Then it happens, I'm hit! A bow from an unknown angle gets me in the chest and in through the lungs! \n\nThats when I wake up SCREAMING to my parents in the room!\n\n\"HEY HEY HEY! You ok, you were really breathing heavy and moving alot! Mom called me home because she was worried you were having a medical issue!\" My dad said, wondering what was wrong!!\n\n\"Did you want me to tell you what was going on!? You'll never believe what I'm going to tell you!\" I said laughing but I did have one question for my mom.\n\n\"Hey mom, where did you find me?\" I asked\n\n\"I found you in the attic, passed out on the floor. You didn't wake up when I shook you so I carried you to your room and put you to bed. Thats when you started acting strange and I called dad!\" She exclaimed\n\nAs I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, I noticed a sharp pain in my side! I got to the bathroom mirror and pulled my shirt up and there on my side was a small incision at the top of my lungs! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, Time Travel can be real, but sometimes the reactions can be real and you'll never know if the history will back it up",

        "text": "A few months back I experienced the most surreal and scariest moment in my life. I wanted to post it to see if anyone else had experienced anything similar.\n\nI was driving up north to my parents house for my cousin's wedding, which was the next day. I had moved away 4 years ago after I got a job in the city. It was about a six-hour drive and I had planned to stop off half way through to get something to eat. I had set off at 09:00, it was nearing 12:30 and my stomach was screaming at me for food. I pulled off the main road towards the service station as I noticed a sign up ahead which read: Diner This Way ➡️\n\nI went past the main service station and carried on down a small side road. I reached an old American style diner, it was shrouded by tall oak trees from the surrounding woods. I parked up thinking to myself that it looked quite busy, as there must have been at least 10 other cars outside. As I walked up and pushed open the door, I had an uneasy feeling that everyone was staring at me. I didn't pay too much attention however, as I would always feel this way when entering this kind of setting. I ultimately put it down to it just being a natural reaction from my buried anxiety. \n\nI went up to the counter and was greeted by a smiling young blonde woman, wearing a clean blue and white uniform. \n\n“Good afternoon sir, what can I get for you today?”\n\n“A cheeseburger, some fries and a black coffee please”. I was still feeling uneasy, like a burning feeling at the back of my head. It made me want to turn around and see who was staring at me but my eyes stayed fixated forward as I paid.\n\nShe said, with her head slightly tilted and the same, wide smile on her face.\n\n“It will be five minutes, sir, please wait here or you can find a seat if you want”\n\nI decided to stand and wait by the counter as I looked nervously around the room, my awkward, right-leaning stance radiated around me. There were probably around 15 people dotted around the black and white decorated seating area. It was, though, strangely silent, only the sound of the sizzling grills and the heavy footsteps of the kitchen staff stood out. I  tried to check my work emails while I was waiting but there was no service, great, I remember thinking. I really hated this awkward wait for food, it was like everyone was making you their brief table side entertainment, judging your every move.\n\nI finally received my food after what felt like an eternity. I  walked with my tray to a small, rounded metal table. I pulled out my chair, and it scraped along the tiled floor below, it echoed throughout the room as I felt that same burning sensation in my head once more. As I sat down I heard the atmosphere change to what you would normally expect of any restaurant, a background of inaudible conversation pursued. I thought it was strange but it eased my nerves exponentially.\n\nI opened up the cardboard box that housed my succulent burger, but something was wrong. There sat in between my two patties was a folded up napkin. I was intrigued but annoyed how one of the kitchen staff had put this in my food. I was about to get up to take it back to the counter when in the kitchen when I saw a young scruffy-looking black haired guy, staring back at me. His eyes widened, and his head nodded forward, seeming to gesture for me to open it up., it read: \n“Do not eat your food, go to the toilet and wait for five minutes! DO NOT TALK TO ANYONE!”\n\nI raised my head towards the kitchen once more, he had gone. My eyes shifted as I looked more closely at the people seated throughout the restaurant. It suddenly dawned on me what that uneasy feeling was. Nobody was eating, they all looked like they were from a quick glance but they weren’t. They were all sat with food in hand, about to eat but before it would reach their mouth they would laugh and say things like, “look at this” or “yeah” or “that’s right” to the person they were sat with. Their conversations seemed forced and automated, a confused look grew on my face. \n\nI glanced over at the tills, there were now three waitresses stood staring at me. They were all smiling but only with there mouths, the rest of their face seemed uncomfortably unaffected. I gave a quick smile and pretended to eat one of my fries. I could see in my peripheral vision their focus had switched straight ahead towards the door. I placed a hand on my stomach and began to get up. I felt that burning sensation again, as if everyone's gaze was on me once more. I walked with a fast pace towards a short corridor and went into the restroom. I closed the door and went into the only cubicle, I was starting to grow anxious to what kind of place I had unwillingly walked into. I noticed a piece of paper within the roll of toilet paper, I slowly pulled it out. It was another written note: \n\n“I’m so sorry, please know that nothing in this place is real, you need to get out of here before your time runs out. I have come to realised that I am immune to whatever trance everyone is in. I came in one day, I ate the food, I must have passed out but my memories still remained. At first I tried to leave but every time I walked out them front doors I end up walking back through the back double doors at the back of the kitchen. Everyone you see in here remembers nothing before this place. I have tried to blend in as much as possible but I can try to help you get out before they make you eat. Trust me, they will make you eat. “\n\nMy breathing started to deepen, and my fast paced heartbeat reverberated from my chest. The note was a warning to get out, but how could I leave? I was trapped in this seemingly fake reality, just like the others. The more I thought about it, the more scared I became. I tried to calm myself down, but the fear was overwhelming.\n\nI suddenly heard a knock at the door, and a voice calling out.\n\n\"Sir, are you okay in there?\"\n\nI quickly stuffed the note into my pocket and opened the door to see a tall gangly waiter standing outside. He had a concerned look on his face, but I could see in his eyes that he was not entirely there.\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" I lied. \"I Just needed to use the restroom as I was feeling slightly ill” I continued while trying to compose myself. \n\n“Sorry to hear that sir, I will prepare you a nice herbal tea if you wish” he said now staring intently into my eyes. \n\n“I’m fine thanks, I just need to get back on the road” I quickly responded while moving swiftly past him. \n\nI went through the restroom doors and turned into the restaurant. The tables were now clear, all of the customers were gone and the door was obstructed by my original table with my food placed neatly in the middle. \n\nA voice sounded behind me,\n\n“I hope you will feel more comfortable now sir, please enjoy your meal.” A sinister voice stated behind me. \n\nThe waiter had followed me out of the restroom and was stood uncomfortably close behind my back.\n\nI closed my eyes and took a deep breath in, my frustration was now seeping into my words.\n\n“I told you I don’t feel well, I will not be eating here, sorry”. I now firmly stated while stepping away from him.\n\nI pushed the table away from the doors and pulled at the two handles. It was locked. \n\n“Let me out” I shouted at the waiter.\n\n“I’m sorry sir, we can’t allow you to leave” a waitress calmly said, while walking slowly from the kitchen. \n\n“Why the fuck not” I snarled back at her.\n\n“You’re a VIP customer, we want to look after you sir” the waiter then announced, a mixture of staff and customers then walked in from the walkway I had just come from, all of their wide glazed eyes trained on me. \n\nMy attention then turned to the kitchen, I saw that young man once again, he was frantically trying to set the place alight. \n\nHe succeeded as a flame burst out from one of the oven units.\n\n “Your kitchen is on fire” I yelled while pointing over to it.\n\nAll of their sadistic smiles had now turned to angry, bitter frowns as they all turned in sync towards the blaring flames. \n\nThis was my chance, I quickly grabbed a chair and threw it with all of my strength at the window. It shattered into an almost infinite amount of shards, as I then jumped onto the wet gravel below. I heard a deafening polyphonic shriek coming from behind me as I sprinted to my car, I hadn’t even noticed it was pitch black outside. \n\nI unlocked my car before taking one more look at the scene I had left behind. They were all  stood in the unnaturally bright surround as they screamed at me, the disgust, the hate, the evil in all of their eyes will never leave my mind. \n\nI turned the ignition and pressed my foot firmly down on the accelerator, my tyres screeched as I sped away. Only then I noticed the time, it was 9:00pm. I had been in there for nearly 9 hours, but that couldn’t be possible. It felt like no more than 45 minutes! I made my way back onto the road to continue my journey, my heart still pounding through my chest. Blue flashing lights appeared in my rear view mirror, it was the police. I pulled over my car as I saw the officer get out and approach me. \n\n“Evening sir, do you have any idea what speed you were going?”\n\n“No, I’m sorry officer, I just had a terrifying experience a the diner at the last service station, i only just escaped” I responded in a hurried tone, I was still trying to catch my breath. \n\n“Sir, have you been drinking tonight?” He said while looking at me confused. \n\n“No officer, why would you think that?” I said in a puzzled tone.\n\n“Please step out of the vehicle sir, I was just at them services, there is no diner anywhere near there” he replied now in a more forceful tone. \n\nI got out of the car and he continued to breathalyze me. Once it came out clear he wrote me up a ticket and sent me on my way. I spent the remainder of my journey trying to make sense of what I experienced. I was greeted with concern when I arrived at my parents house, due to me arriving so late. I told them what happened and I could see the worried disbelief pasted on their faces. The next morning, I tried to search online about  any diners in the area of that service station. I found an old archive newspaper article dated back to 1976, it read how a small diner, off the road I had been travelling down had tragically burnt down with 24 people inside. \n\nI felt every hair on my body shift as a chill went down my spine as I looked at the black and white photo below it.\n\nIt was the exact same terrifying Diner I was sat in the day before.",

        "text": "Most people have fond memories of Halloween.\n\nNot me. I couldn’t enjoy it after I saw the boy wearing the Power Ranger mask.\n\nI can remember a few years when I was little and enjoyed it. My parents would walk hand in hand with me through the neighborhood. My eyes darted around in fascination. Dozens of ghouls and goblins laughed in delight as they darted from house to house, heavy sacks of candy slapping at their knees. I couldn’t wait until I was old enough to go with my friends.\n\nThe big day finally hit when I was in fourth grade.\n\n“You can go with your friends, Derek,” my father said hesitantly. “But you’ve got to be careful! Home by eight!”\n\nI nodded with excitement and darted out the door. My friends and I met two blocks from my house and prowled the neighborhood with delight. None of us had been trick-or-treating without our parents. The night seemed full of possibilities.\n\nAfter two hours of nonstop door knocking, our candy bags were weighing heavily and it was close to curfew. Our group grew smaller as we walked. One friend or another would wave goodbye and cut off onto their street. Soon I was walking alone.\n\nI was four blocks from home when I saw the little boy wearing a red Power Ranger mask. He was standing alone near a line of trees, his head darting side to side in a panic. Even from a block away, I could hear his sobs.\n\n“Can you help me?” he said as I got closer. He looked like he couldn’t have been any older than five. “I can’t find my brother.”\n\n“Umm… I guess,” I said hesitantly. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Danny,” he whimpered.\n\n“I’ve gotta get home soon,” I said and looked at my watch. It was a quarter till seven and I only had fifteen minutes to get home. I wanted to help him, but I was nervous to break curfew my first time out on my own. “Where do you live? Is it very far away?”\n\nThe little boy tried to talk but more sobbing poured out. His shoulders shook violently and candy sloshed from his bucket. He squatted to pick it up but only dumped more onto the ground.\n\n“Do you know your address?” I asked. He just kept scooping the scattered candy back into his plastic pumpkin bucket. Looking down at my watch, I saw as time slipped away. In frustration, I reached out and grabbed the kid's wrist, and pulled him to his feet. \n\n“Come on,” I said. “I’m taking you home with me. My parents can call the police and get you home.”\n\nThe boy went rigid and began to tug against me. I turned to ask him what was wrong but he thrashed wildly. My grip slipped and he stumbled backward onto the concrete. His reassembled bucket of candy scattered across the sidewalk.\n\n“No!” he shrieked. “No! I’ll be in big trouble! I wasn’t ‘posed to go anywhere without my brother. Mom and Dad will be mad!”\n\n“It’s not a big deal,” I said. “They'll just be glad you’re home. Let me help you up.”\n\nI began walking toward him but he scuttled backward. Before I could reach him he was back on his feet and running down the street.\n\nShrugging my shoulders, I turned and headed home. I walked in the door with two minutes to spare. My parents hugged me and asked if I had a good time. For a moment I considered telling them about the lost boy but decided against it. I assumed he made it home and didn’t want them to hound me about it.\n\nThat night I barely slept. I couldn’t help but wonder if the boy made it home. Someone must have come looking for him. His brother probably heard him screaming when I tried to help him.\n\nThe next morning at school I sat nodding at my desk. Morning announcements were blasting through the speaker but I didn’t register them. I was struggling to stay awake.\n\nUntil they mentioned the boy.\n\n“Finally, a five-year-old boy, Daniel Fireline, was reported missing last night. He became separated from his brother and never returned home. If you have any information…”\n\nI never told anyone.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI moved into the house on South Kentucky Avenue three years ago. My wife and I had gone through a reasonably civil divorce. Will was only two at the time. We had shared custody, but I knew he would stay there more.\n\nThe schools were better on that side of town.\n\nMoving into the new place hadn’t bothered me very much. I had grown up only a block away. The neighborhood was shabbier than it was when I was a kid, but it had a comforting familiarity. \n\nI decided to skip Halloween for the first two years. As nighttime approached, I would cut all the lights and sit in bed watching TV. Even without the lights, the kids would knock at my door. I could hear them shouting for my attention, but I ignored them. They would eventually leave.\n\nAs it turns out, my ignoring them came with a price.\n\nTwo years in a row my house was egged and toileted papered. I can remember other kids doing those kinds of things when I was younger, but I had never participated myself. It took me nearly a week to get the dried yolks off of the siding and to gather the final scraps of white toilet tissue out of the trees.\n\nAgainst my desire, during my third year in the house, I decided to pass out candy. I thought it would be a small price to pay not to spend a week undoing the “trick” portion of the ritual. I bought a few sacks of snack-sized candy bars at the grocery store and dumped them into a cheap orange bowl.\n\nJust as dusk began to set in, the hordes of children converged on the neighborhood. I did my best to act cheery as I dumped candy into their bags. To my surprise, I enjoyed seeing them in their costumes darting from house to house.\n\nAbout an hour in the doorbell rang again. I stood from my recliner and walked toward the door, scooping up the bowl of candy as I went. When I opened the door, there was a little boy dressed in jeans, a blue hoodie, and a clown mask that was roughly two sizes too large for his tiny head.\n\n“How are you doing tonight, buddy?” I asked as I grabbed a handful of candy from the bowl. His orange bucket was still hanging by his side and he looked at me in silence. “Hold your bucket up and I’ll give you some candy!”\n\nThe little boy continued to stand there in silence. No parent or older sibling waiting on the sidewalk for them. He was alone.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked with a lump in my throat.\n\nWithout a word, he lifted his pale. I tossed the candy in and smiled. Assuming he would move along, I wished him a happy Halloween and closed the storm door between us. Walking into the hall, I sat the bowl back on the table. I was about to head back to the recliner when I saw the kid out of the corner of my eye.\n\nHe was still standing on the porch, staring in through the storm door.\n\nA knot formed in my stomach. He stood rigid like a mannequin. I would have thought he was some cheap prop or decoration if I hadn’t seen him move moments earlier. It was just a kid, but his unsettling presence sent chills up my spine.\n\nI headed to check on him when he suddenly turned and darted off of the porch. As he met the end of the walkway, he stumbled and dropped his bucket of candy. Concerned, I began to walk faster toward the door to help him. Before my hand hit the handle, he pushed himself up and darted down the block.\n\nAnother half hour went by. A smattering of trick-or-treaters came and went. The crowd was beginning to thin. Some of the neighbors had turned off their porch lights and shut the doors. They must not have had the same fear of eggs and toilet paper that I had gained.\n\nAnother ring of the doorbell and I headed to the door. Looking into the bowl, the candy was almost gone. There was probably only enough for about a dozen more kids and I was considering just splitting it up between these lucky kids and calling it a night.\n\nWhen I pulled the door open, a single child stood outside. A rubber pirate mask with an eye patch and a fake gold earring looked back at me. I laughed at how comically large it was on the little kid.\n\n“Happy Halloween!” I exclaimed as I gathered up some candy from the bowl. The child stood like a statue, hands at his side. That’s when I noticed the plastic orange bucket at his side, rubbing against a pair of blue jeans. Then the blue sweatshirt.\n\nIt was the same kid as earlier.\n\n“Hey buddy,” I said with irritation. “Weren’t you here earlier? I’ll give you a little more candy, but this is the last time.”\n\nI tossed the candy in and it pelted the bottom of the empty bucket. That late into the night, he should have been overflowing with candy. It was like he hadn’t been to any other houses after he fell on the sidewalk, dumping his stash.\n\nUnlike the time before, he turned to leave. I expected him to break into a run but he walked calmly to the end of the block and around the corner. Out of sight.\n\nSomething felt off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI ran out of candy at about eight that night so I turned off the porch light and headed into the living room to watch television. It hadn’t been the miserable experience I expected, but the strange kid still rattled around in my mind.\n\nOccasionally I would glance out the window to watch as the costumed children marched down the street. Clusters of them still darted to houses with illuminated porch lights. Their buckets were overflowing and they chattered like magpies.\n\nDuring a commercial, I pushed myself out of the recliner and headed toward the kitchen. As I was about to exit the living room into the hallway, I heard a tapping on the window. When I turned to look there was only the briefest glimpse of a silhouette darting out of view. I walked to the window to catch a glimpse of the prankster, but when I arrived they were nowhere in sight.\n\nAs I looked out, I heard a knock at the door. I sighed in exasperation. No porch light on Halloween was the international sign for No More Candy. I had played my part most of that night but I started to worry that turning kids away would result in the third year of egg-covered siding and toilet paper-filled trees.\n\nTrudging to the front door, I loudly exclaimed “Sorry kids! No more candy. I ran out about a half hour ago. Sorry!”\n\nI turned the knob and opened the door. There was no one on the porch. Scanning the street, I could see a few children in the distance, but for the most part, the block was empty. Hesitantly, I pushed open the storm door and stepped onto the porch, and heard a crunching noise beneath my feet.\n\nI looked down and saw a red Power Ranger mask splintered into dozens of pieces beneath my shoe.\n\nIt looked just like the one the lost boy had on all of those decades ago.\n\nMy pulse spiked and my chest tightened. Though I had never had one before, I was sure it was what a panic attack must feel like. My vision became blurry and an overwhelming sense of dread filled every inch of my body.\n\nThen I heard the sobbing.\n\n“Why… why… why didn’t you help me?” I heard a small voice say from behind me. Turning to look into the hallway, I saw a young boy in jeans, a blue hoodie, and a head full of messy auburn hair. His skin was sickeningly pale and the hall was filled with a nauseating mixture of mildew and the sweetness of decay. \n\nIt was Daniel Fireline. The little boy who had disappeared.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell anyone you saw me? They hurt me, Derek. They put me in the dark and no one came to find me.”\n\nI tried to speak but only a dry croak came out of my mouth.\n\n“My Mommy and Daddy are still so sad,” he said. His tiny feet made tapping noises on the hardwood floor and he began to walk toward me. One of his pale hands stretched out toward me as I stumbled backward and fell against the storm door. “I’m still there… in the dark. It’s scary and I don’t like it.”\n\n“I’m… I’m sorry…” I muttered in a weak voice. “I was a kid. I tried to help but you ran. I thought you’d make it home!”\n\nHe continued walking slowly toward me, hand outstretched. Tears ran down his pale skin, leaving streaks in the dirt smeared on his cheeks. His eyes were milky white, filled with rage and fear.\n\n“What can I do?” I screamed. “Please! Let me make it right!”\n\nDanny stopped walking toward me and dropped his hand back to his side. His tears ceased and he wiped away the dirt from his face with his sleeve.\n\n“I don’t want to be alone there anymore,” he said softly. “It’s dark and I hate it.”\n\n“I’ll do anything you want,” I whimpered.\n\nHis head tilted to the side as though he were deep in thought. The milky gaze of his eyes drifted to my left. He was staring at a picture by the door.\n\nA photo of my son and me.\n\n“I’ll take him,” he said, pointing to the portrait. “He can keep me company. Then I won’t be alone anymore.”\n\nI jumped from the floor to run to the boy. To beg and plead for him to take me. To tell him that I would stay with him. \n\nBefore I could reach him or speak another word, Danny faded away like a mirage.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBy the time I arrived at my ex-wife’s house, there were already a half dozen police cars lining the street. The wash of blue and red lights illuminated the night like an arcade. Sarah was standing on the porch talking to the officers as I pushed my way through the crowd.\n\nSarah ran to me and threw her arms around me and I pulled her in close.\n\n“He’s gone,” she wept into my ear. “We were at the last house of the night and I was talking to the lady at the door. I only took my eyes off of him for just a minute and he was gone.”\n\nI tried to speak, but again, no words come out.\n\n“The officers have a few witnesses that saw him though,” Sarah said softly. “He was walking into the park holding hands with a little boy in a blue hoodie and a Power Ranger [mask.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)",

        "text": "      I grew up in the deep in the Appalachian\nmountians. As a boy i spent my days in carefree bliss running through oaken forests and tromping through streams and bush in the vast expance of state land that was practically my backyard. In those carefree days of exploration it was just me and my dog Sam, our adventures never ended. Sometimes Sam would go off on his own. In those times though he would always come home. Usually, it was after dinner. After me, ma, and pa had dinner he would show up scratching at the door, howling and whineing to be let in.\n    Quite suddenly Sam disapeared. It broke my little heart. It was normal for him to run the trails and slip through the trees by himself most days, but he always returned near dinner, as usual. One day he simply stopped comeing home. I made a big scene, and me, ma, and pa even got together with some of the neighbors and went looking for him, but we never found anything to help figure out what happend. \n     I was overjoyed when my best friend returned 2 weeks later seemingly in great health! However, he was not the dog used to be. We took him to town and got him a check up, he was ok, but his carefree and happy demeanor was replaced with that of a cold mean animal. He no longer slept in my bed or tromped through the woods with me. He would just sit and stare at us, a cruel snarl constantly on his lips. We had resolved to continue to love him regardless. \n     A week after he returned he mauled my mother. The injuries were extensive. She had gone outside to smoke as she often did, and the next thing i knew the screaming started. I ran outside to see her arm and face a mangled mess of torn skin and hanging gore gore. The blood sprayed stickily across the ground. We knew instantly what had to happen. I ran inside and grabbed the gun, my father ran out and tried to control the Sam. I ran up out. I lined up the shot. point blank to his skull i squeezed the trigger. With a thunderous crack his brains explodes onto the ground mixing with the puddle of gore that was my mother.\n      Me and pa rushed mom to the hospital. Alot of family and friends came to visit. She needed extensive recovery and treatment, but she pulled through. During the long nights of her recovery, when Pa would spend time comforting my batterd mother, i would spend the time quietly alone in the house. At that time i learned to fear those woods.\n      The events started when the grave we had dug for Sam was tossed. We had believed it was animals scavangeing. He was buried a ways behind the house. We had alot of resentment for that dog for what he did. Eventually though we came to believe it was a case of rabies, even though the vetrinarian had came to collect a sample, and swore it wasent, they dont always know everything.\n      My walks in the woods were no longer pleasent and full of wonder. There was only terror, as a cold cruel darkness fell on the woods. A figure was seemingly darting through the underbrush in my periphrals at every turn. The scraggily oaks cast long devious shadows. There was a constant rustle, and something was out there with me. I had checked the source of the sound once. I only found a trail of blood and mucus. It was around that time i stopped going into the woods.\n        I had only a bit longer to wait till my mother was realeased. we had decided to move away to put her horrific mauling behind us. That ment i would spend just a little longer by myself getting ready while pa helped ma in the hospital.\n         A coupple nights before ma was getting released things became unhinged. That night there was no sound. It was a dead silence. I sat in the living room, i had finished dinner, i was packing boxes. Thats when i heard the scratching. It was the sound of nails grateing a chalkboard. First it was barely audible like a silent protest in the wind. A sound that was encompassing, engrossing and maddening. It came from everywhere and nowhere. It was accompanied by an ethereal and otherworldly howling. It resounded in such a way that the eldritch tones played painfully accross my brain. In my delusional state between wake and sleep i steppes twords the front door, and in my insanity i opened it.\n     I can not descride it wholelly. It seemes to stand considerably higher then a man. Its body was wirey, sickly and malformed it seemed died in a sickly tar like substance. Between that tar there were patches of fur mixed with streatched gore and pulled hanging flesh. As i looked in its face i saw the remaining half of my best friends demolished skull hanging by bits of sivkly sticky flesh stuck in a pitifull twisted grin. In that moment the creature lunged forward and i slammed the door in its face locking it. Throughout that long night the dead silence was accompanied by that strange, evil, maddening howl.\n       To my suprise, i woke the next morning. The howl rang in my ear, i could barely remember who i was. Dad came to pick me up and took me to see mom. He noted the large scratch marks on the door, but he got mad at me for damageing the house. I tried to explain on the ride to the hospital, but he wasent haveing any of it. He tried to make me go back. I refused. I began to sob when he tried. I told him \"no ill stay with ma\" through my tears. He let me stay.\nI never saw dad again. He never came to pick up me or mom. \n      My uncle came to get us. We went home but the no one was there. The house was trashed just scratches everywhere. I tried to tell them what happend, but no one would believe me. They said pa went mad and then ran away. We started living with my uncle and his family after that since ma needed help. I still hear the howling in my dreams, the scratching. It comes from inside my skull now, and tries to burrow its way out of me. Its a hallucination or not i cant tell.\n     Im sorry ma, im sorry pa, im sorry Sam.\nIt was all so long ago, but i moved on. I cant tell if it was real or not anymore. My therapist suggested it was a vivid hallucination caused by grief. She thinks i should try seeing if i can go back and stay in the old family home for a week or two, i heard it was an Air bnb now. She was also the one who thought i should write my experiance as a fiction to help heal. Maybe ill go and bring my girlfriend. make a nice healing romantic weekend of it.",

        "text": "So last week I visited my cousin who is living in an apartment, her room is in the 3rd floor, close to the staircases. The apartment was relatively old, she says that this apartment is older than our parents, at least that's what she heard from the others. She moved there because she doesn't like dorm, and since I told her I'll be visiting her frequently, she had her dad bought a double deck.\n\nAnyway, I arrived at her apartment like 10 or 11 AM, and as usual we greet each other with a hug and then I'll drop down my baggage in her room, and we spent a lot of time talking.\n\nShe bragged about how cheap the rent is and how lucky she is that the people next door are nice and how the guy in the opposite side of the hall is hot.\n\nIt was until 4 when she got up and said she'll be going out to buy some snacks, she asked if I want to go with her, but I was feeling lazy so I said, \"Nah I'll pass.\" She didn't mind it and asked if there's anything I want and I said, \"Noodles, the spicy beef one, that's all ehehe.\" She nods and waves her hand before going out, a few seconds I saw her close the door and I was alone.\n\nWell nothing really happened aside me lazing in the bed and for the record I used the lower bed, I don't really like sleeping on top. I was browsing through my fb when I heard someone knock thrice at the door, \"Eh? Is she back that quick?\" I stand up and went to the door and open it without a second thought.\n\nThere my cousin was standing in front of me but something's odd, for starters she is empty handed and her skin is a sickening death pale, her expression was blank and she was staring at me.\n\nI freaked out and asked her what happened, but she didn't say anything and just went inside, shoving me away. \n\nI followed her and kept nagging her to at least talk to me cause I'm getting scared as fuck. I don't know if this is some sort of prank or something bad happened to her, I just don't know cause she won't say a thing to me. \n\nShe got on top of the bed, she lied down, curled herself up and hid herself in the blankets. I sighed and said to her, \"Hey, you know you can talk to me if there are things troubling you, anyway I'll give you some space.\" With that I also rested myself below and distracted myself using my phone.\n\nAfter 10 mins or so, a chat head pop up and it was my cousin, I instinctively opened it and what I read made me chuckle. \"I knew it! You fucking got me there asshole!\" I shouted and burst out laughing, while kicking the mattress. Her message was, \"Yo there's no spicy beef here, you want something else?\"\n\nBut there was no response, not a laugh, not a crackle, not a damn word. There was nothing. I kicked the mattress again and messaged her this time to knock it off.\n\nBut her response made me confused and quite to be honest scary, she messaged back and said, \"tf you mean to knock it off?\"\n\nI dismissed and rolled my eyes, \"Seriously, stop it, it's not funny fr fr\" I messaged her back.\n\nShe messaged me again, \"I swear to God you're getting on my nerves, what the hell do you mean 'to knock it off', you lazy bum!?\" \n\nI got agitated and furiously mashed the keyboard replying as fast as I can, \"You! You came back empty handed with a fucking pale face and you straight up ignore me! I thought something terrible happened to you!\" After I sent the message she read it and didn't reply to me.\n\nI got even more restless, a minute pass and she still haven't replied. I was about to message her when she sent a photo. It was a picture of her in the convenience store with a puzzled and annoyed look, but her skin wasn't pale at all.\n\nI clicked my tongue in annoyance and kicked the mattress again, \"You probably took that before going back.\" \n\nShe replied quickly this time, \"Fine then, you prick.\" After she sent that message she immediately called me. I picked it up and she readily opened her camera. She was in fact in the store, there with her normal complexion, her annoyed expression.\n\nImmediately, my blood ran cold and my hair rose up, shivers went down on my spine. In a weak voice I uttered, \"Then who was it the came inside this room?\" \n\nMy cousin noticed my horrified expression and asked me what I saw. I slowly said everything what happened to her and she too was terrified.\n\nI want to run, I want to get the fuck out of here, but I remained paralyzed, unable to move my legs. My eyes teared up and I was panicking.\n\n\"HEY! GET OUT OF THERE!! KAT!!\" My cousin's yelling broke my stance and with every adrenaline in my body, I sprang out of the bed.\n\nI fell into cold wooden floor and when I got up, I made the biggest mistake in my entire life and that was taking a glance on top of the bed.\n\nWhat I saw there will forever haunt me for the rest of my entire life.\n\nIt's height is comparable to a little boy, it's skin were burned, it got no eyes, only a darkness void, it's mouth was contorted to an inhuman grin, baring it's yellow teeth and fangs. It was sitting in a fetal position and I felt like it was staring into my soul.\n\nIt made me freeze for a few seconds, staring into that, if my cousin sees what I'm seeing now she'll pass out and I'm glad that I accidentally end the call when I sprang out of the bed.\n\nIt slowly reached towards me and when it was so close to my face, it said, \"Let's play!\" It was no voice of a child but a demon or a monster, it was like a low guttural voice, forcing itself to make itself sound like a child.\n\nIt broke the dam and I screamed to the top of my lungs and ran fast as I can never to look back. \n\nI got out of the room and quickly descended the flight of stairs, I got down and exited the apartment, where I tripped and fell to the ground, I cried and cried, as I stand up to run again. I look back and saw it, peeking at the stairs. I shrilled like a crazed lady and run till I reach the convenience store.\n\nI got there inside and quickly saw my worried cousin, I run to her and hugged her deeply, while begging her to move out. I raised a commotion for sure but I don't care, I will only stop when my cousin agrees to me.\n\nMaybe a couple of minutes have passed and she agreed and with that the energy was sucked out of me and I passed out.\n\nMe passing out was probably the last time I'll be unconscious without nightmares.\n\nAnyway I woke up in my home, my cousin was playing with her phone and when she saw me she quickly hugged me. She cried, repeatedly saying, \"thank God!\" Anyway she soon calmed down and I asked what happened.\n\n\"Well before I moved out I asked the neighbors if they know something about this. Apparently, there was a family who lived there back then, a mother and her only child. They say that her mother was busy at work since she was a single mom and her only child was always left alone in the room, one night there was a fire accident that burned down the entire third floor and the mother was late at work so she wasn't able to save her child and no one was able to save them as well. The mother soon took away her life. After that they have that place restored back, but soon that room I rented started having weird things happening, like they'll hear a child crying or calling for their mom. But yours was probably the worst that could ever happened. I'm so sorry if only I know.\"\n\nI let it all sink in and I flopped down the bed, tears welled up and I sobbed, while my cousin comforts me. \"It...was...like...a...demon\" I choked the words out. \n\nEver since that day my life was a living hell, every night I have nightmares, I kept seeing it from the corner of my eyes when I'm alone and sometimes I'll hear it when I'm cooking breakfast, giggling like a child but it sounded more like of a low pitch hollow giggle.\n\nI don't think I'll live normally again after this.",

        "text": "I moved into the abandoned apartment complex, which the locals called Angel Trace Park, at the edge of town. No one had lived there for decades. Even drug addicts and homeless people avoided it like the plague. I never understood it, but I wasn’t questioning my luck. I had lost my job and was literally penniless- I didn’t even have enough spare change to ride the bus across town. I was able to get food from the food bank, and find a good Samaritan or two to bum a few cigarettes from, but other than that I was living the life of a monk. I had a backpack with a few spare clothes in it, a toothbrush, toothpaste and soap, some ID, a pocketknife- and that was it.\n\nI had spent a week at Angel Trace without incident. On the seventh day, I began to realize something was wrong. It was summertime, the crickets buzzing outside the window, a fresh-smelling breeze flowing in through the broken windows of Angel Trace. I used my backpack as a pillow in the corner and fell asleep. I had explored the entire complex, and carefully chosen an apartment in the back of the floor with only one exit and entrance, so that no one could sneak up on me to rob me- or worse. Sometimes the homeless around here were beaten by drunk gangs of youths for fun, and the police almost never did anything about it. \n\nThe broken windows of the bedroom allowed wisps of light to flow through, allowing me to see silhouettes but nothing more substantial than that.\n\nAs I slept, I kept feeling something softly tickling my cheeks, my forehead, my hair, but every time I stirred and looked around, I saw nothing. I hoped it wasn’t spiders, vigorously rubbing at my face in case one had landed on me. I felt around my backpack for a flashlight, turned it on, and immediately began to scream.\n\nSomeone stood before me, their face appearing to melt and liquefy. I saw their eyes changing from blue to brown to green, their pupils dilating and constricting rapidly as they stared down at me. The flesh over their cheeks formed into a beautiful woman, then reformed into an old man with wrinkled skin, before changing to the face of a small child. It was as if a thousand faces were all shifting and appearing in the mass of melting skin, quickly showing the bones and muscle underneath before changing to the next shape.\n\nI immediately began to push against the hardwood floor with my legs, rapidly scooting back away from the creature. In the process I dropped the flashlight and it began to twirl on the floor, sending dancing silhouettes and strobing shadows on the walls. By the time I picked it up again and focused it on the spot where I had seen the melting being, the monstrosity was gone.\n\nThen the flashlight shut off, a twanging sound echoing across the room as something in it broke, and I was plunged back into darkness. I heard heavy, creaking footsteps as something approached. An overwhelming weight descended upon my chest, and I started thrashing and screaming. I felt fingers shoved in my mouth, fingers whose skin seemed to melt off, as if decomposing under a strong acid. I tasted the rancid skin, the copper and iron of blood, and a deeper and more foul taste that overpowered all of it- a taste like meat that has been left out to rot in the summer sun for weeks on end.\n\n“Shh, don’t struggle so, my child,” a wheezing, decrepit voice said in my ear, blowing the smell of decay directly next to my face. I started to gag, thrashing with all my might to push the thing off of me, but it felt like I was fighting a mountain. “It may feel bitter to die, but in the end it is the sweetest thing of all.”\n\nTerrified and furious, I reached up at the thing’s face, frantically clawing at its skin. It came off in chunks, sticking to my hand and sliding down my arm and wrist in warm, wet trails. Finally I felt one of its eyes, and using all my strength, I shoved my thumb into it. The thing on top of me screamed so loudly that I thought my eardrums would burst. But it didn’t sound human. It sounded more like a plane engine revving up in a deafening cacophony that shook the floors.\n\nIn an instant, I was free, taking in deep gasps of sweet air, the suffocating fear that had enveloped me slowly receding. I grasped around for the flashlight, finding it on the floor nearby. I tried turning it on again but no light came out. I began to feel around my pockets, finding a lighter and flicking it. After a couple flicks, the flame shot out. That thing was gone, but some melting flesh-colored substance still dripped off my fingers. Pieces of blood, teeth and bone littered the floor. I could see a random eyeball stuck to the floor by tacky blood, next to pieces of blackened, rotten intestines.\n\nAll I could hear in the silence was my own heavy breathing, the pounding of my heart, the faint cries of the bugs outside. Nothing else stirred or moved. I shone the lighter around, but whatever had attacked me had disappeared.\n\n“I have to get out of here,” I said softly to myself. “This is all wrong. This place feels… evil..” But I didn’t leave. I was tired and had nowhere else to go in the middle of the night. I took a pocket knife out of my backpack and kept it in my hand, in case I got attacked again. Within a few minutes, fatigue overpowered me, and I had fallen back asleep, resting my head on my backpack and staring at the single pane of light that shone through the broken window. When I awoke, it was morning. All signs of the attack the previous night were gone.\n\nThere was no melted flesh on the floor, no bone fragments, no remnants of the monster at all. Even my fingers and hands were clean. Daylight poured in and drove all the horrors of the nighttime away. I assumed I had simply had an extremely vivid nightmare. I had heard of cases where people had sleep paralysis and thought someone, or something, was standing on their chest, suffocating them. It seemed to fit exactly with my experience the previous night.\n\nI spent the rest of the day panhandling, going to soup kitchens to get meals, walking around the park and exploring the local library. I did not want to be homeless forever.\n\nIt was a terrible life, full of cold, heat, fear, hunger and thirst. But worse than all of that was the *hopelessness* of my situation. I felt I couldn’t get a job without getting an apartment, and how could I possibly afford housing without a job? I couldn’t focus on a relationship or friendships because I was too worried about the lack of money, housing and transportation I had, so my life felt constantly meaningless and lonely. It felt like I was stuck in some endless catch-22, and without family or friends nearby to help me, it seemed I had few options to get back on my feet. \n\nI contacted social services about potential help securing work and housing, and before I knew it, the sun was setting again. Sighing, I began to walk back to Angel Trace.\n\nAs the sun faded behind the complex, sending red spikes through the clouds, I took in the scenery around the abandoned building. The trees and bushes near it all seemed dead, their leaves gone and their branches dry and cracking. The building itself soared over twenty stories in the air, reminding me of some ancient Mayan pyramid for sacrificing captured prisoners. It had a slight pyramidal shape and was the gray, lifeless color of concrete. Most of its windows were smashed. I looked at the upper stories, and saw a face peering down at me from the thirteenth floor. It was far away, but as I squinted and tried to capture all the details I could, I saw the thing staring down at me had skin melting off of its grinning face. All of its teeth shone, along with the bone from its lower skull, making its smile stretch from ear to ear.\n\n“Sir?” a man asked from a bench to my right. I jumped, having not seen him. I had been so totally focused on the building that I would have walked right past him. He wore all black and sat in the shadow of a group of oak trees. He looked ancient, at least ninety, with a face like a sad, wrinkled bulldog. His eyes were hidden under countless folds, and he sniffled constantly. It looked like a strong breeze might blow him off the bench.\n\n“Do you live here?” he said in a trembling, low voice. He pointed to Angel Trace with a shaky finger.\n\n“Yes, I do,” I said, seeing no point in lying to this old man.\n\n“I’m looking to pay someone who knows the complex, inside and out,” he said. “I’m looking for a special area to do a ritual. This place, the locals say, is cursed, and I need the presence of… something unusual. Something powerful. Maybe somewhere where people tend to see beings that are not of this world, or feel a presence, like someone watching you. Would you know any place in the complex like that?” My heart stopped as he looked up at me. It was as if he knew what had happened to me the previous night.\n\n“Something happened to me in the back-most room on the 13th floor last night,” I said. “I think something is living there. Something not human.” Remembering the melting, decaying fingers being shoved in my mouth, I shuddered.\n\n“This place was terrible when people used to live here,” the old man said, giving a wary sideways glance to the Angel Trace building. “I have lived in this town my entire life, and we used to hear constant rumors about the goings-on there. Apparently it was full of gang members, pedophiles, sex offenders, criminals and drug dealers of the worst types. The police were constantly being called in for suicides, drug overdoses and murders, to the point where the city wanted to shut it down permanently. But it wasn’t until Jeremiah Lands killed himself on the 13th floor that this place really began to get… let’s say, out of control.” \n\nI shuddered inwardly. Everyone around here knew the story of Jeremiah Lands, the serial killer who raped and tortured at least seven women. I knew he used to dispose of their bodies in the nearby river, so the media began calling him the “Mapoho River Slasher”. Eventually police got a break in the case when they saw his license plate on some security camera in the same block where the last victim disappeared on her way home from high school. They got a search warrant and started breaking down the door of his apartment in Angel Trace, but he started shooting through the door with shotgun slugs, killing two police officers before putting the gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger.\n\n“Oh my God,” I said, more to myself than the old man. “His apartment was on the 13th floor?” My heart fluttered in my chest as I put together the connections.\n\n“Yes sir,” the old man said, “the last apartment on the right side.”\n\n“I knew it,” I muttered. “That was where I saw… something. Something horrible.” I wondered if Jeremiah Lands had anything to do with the melting shadow-being I had encountered the previous night, if indeed that hadn’t just been a nightmare. Maybe his ghost was upset that I was sleeping in the room where he had committed suicide and taken his final stand.\n\n“By the way,” the old man said, reaching out his hand, “my name is Henry. I’m looking for some help in Angel Trace, and I am willing to pay quite handsomely. I think you are the only one qualified to help me.” He took out a wad of cash from his inner coat pocket. “$2000, in cash, if you show me exactly where this event happened to you, and give me some minor help with a ritual I am planning tonight.” My eyes widened at the money in front of me. I could potentially use that money for a security deposit,, and maybe get out of this constant cycle of homelessness and joblessness.\n\n“My name is Dmitri,” I said, shaking his hand and feeling the small, bird-like bones beneath his skin, “and you have a deal.”\n\nAs the last rays of sun disappeared, we walked into the musty entrance of the complex. The noises and smells of summer faded behind us as we walked up the staircase to the thirteenth floor. The entire building smelled like dust, decaying wood and mold.\n\nBy the time we got to the apartment of Jeremiah Lands, I took out my new flashlight to guide our way. The sunlight had all disappeared, and with no nearby streetlamps, only the light of the full moon shone through the broken windows.\n\nHenry quickly assembled his materials for the ritual, drawing a seven-pointed star across the entire floor of the room with blood. I didn’t ask what kind of blood it was or where he got it. Some questions might be better left unasked.\n\nHe lit thirteen black candles around the star, claiming that the candles had cremated human remains mixed in with the wax. Then he got down on his knees in the center of the star and started chanting in a language I had never heard before. It almost sounded like Hebrew or Arabic, but I knew a little of each and could tell it wasn’t either. \n\nWithout a word or a moment of hesitation, he took out a dagger from his pocket and sliced his left hand wide open, letting the flood of blood pool in the center of the star. He started chanting faster and louder, and I saw with horror that his blood was reforming itself into a bloody, cataract-covered eye on the floor. It looked quickly around in all directions, its milky pupil dilating rapidly. The chanting stopped, but the room was humming, as if with thousands of electrical power lines overhead. It felt hard to breathe, like the room was closing in around me. And then, within the space of a moment, the humming stopped and all Hell broke loose.\n\nOutside the windows, I saw endless insectoid eyes all the way to the horizon. They flitted rapidly, looking in all directions. As I drew closer, I realized the building was surrounded by millions of massive buzzing monstrosities. Dragonflies the size of airplanes flew through the sky, their blood-red eyes coldly regarding the earth below.\n\nA black, fetid-smelling stream now ran directly beneath the window. Scorpions and snakes continuously crawled out of it, their stingers and fangs looking like swords, their gargantuan bodies moving unbelievably fast, blurring across the ground. I heard countless overlapping screams and saw thousands of naked, bleeding people, constantly stung by the scorpions or bitten by the snakes. Their bodies swelled and turned purple and blue, their throats closing from the effects of the poison, but as soon as they stopped thrashing and died, their injuries all miraculously healed themselves. They would rise up, screaming and gagging, until a new horror overtook them.\n\n“Where are we?” I asked myself as I looked into the alien world outside. There were no stars in the sky, no moon, just an endless inky gray sheet above us. I knew we weren’t on Earth anymore.\n\n“This is the place where the insane dream and the gods of old drink the blood of the lambs,” Henry said in a hoarse voice behind me, choking and gasping for breath. I turned around and saw that the bloody seven-pointed star had disappeared, as if the hardwood floor had simply drunk up every drop of blood and left no trace. The eye that had been in the floor in the center of the room now belonged to a tall eldritch abomination.\n\nIt stood over ten feet tall, its single milky eye constantly searching, its body pure black and shining, like the skin of a poisonous snake. Its mouth opened, unhinging and dropping nearly to the floor, and it began to speak in a buzzing, insectile voice. Its word had no changes in cadence or pitch, and an almost robotic emotionless quality to them.\n\n“Thirsty,” it said in a monotone voice. “Henry Lands, let me drink.” It spoke his name as if it were one word. Henry raised his still gushing hand, standing up slowly, and the monstrosity put its mouth underneath, letting small rivulets of blood rush into his mouth.\n\n“They are welcoming the queen home,” Henry said cryptically as the creature drank his blood. As my anxiety and terror rose, I backed away from them as far as I could, going to the corner of the room and trying not to look out the window. I just wanted this bizarre ritual to be over. What was his endgame in all this? Why did he need me to be with him? I felt like I wouldn’t like the answers to the questions I asked myself.\n\n“Wait,” I said, fear and horror overwhelming me, “did he call you Henry *Lands?* As in the father of Jeremiah Lands?” Henry smiled at me. Blood began to flow out of his nose and eyes as his frail body quivered next to the monstrous creature.\n\n“I am giving myself to bring my son back. His mission was not completed. We needed only one more victim to break through this illusion and open up the doorway to the true world beyond. You see it now before you, just as my son and I did at the beginning.” He raised the bloody dagger to his throat, coughing up a few droplets of blood before putting it underneath his right ear. “And I am the last victim. I give myself to you, my son!” Henry cried out, quickly cutting his throat from ear to ear. The dagger was so sharp that for a moment, it didn’t even look like there was a separation in his flesh. Then his entire head began to fall backwards, held on by only a thin layer of muscle, skin and bone. Blood poured like a waterfall over the front of his chest, soaking his shirt instantly.\n\nThe creature throbbed with excitement and energy as its one blind eye looked down on Henry’s dying body. With an insectile voice, it cried, “Your sacrifice is worthy, my father! Worthy is the lamb, but how much greater is the dragon that consumes the world. I have always loved you, father, and what I do now, I do for us- to bring the truth to those without eyes.” It opened a gaping maw with hundreds of shark-like teeth, kneeling down in front of his father’s body and sucking all the blood from his spurting neck. I saw a look of complete and total peace in Henry’s eyes as this demonic spirit of his son ate his remaining life force. He looked like a saint who died knowing Heaven is only seconds away- but there was something twisted and unnatural about the peace that radiated from his dying eyes.\n\nWithin seconds, the body began to wither and dry up like a husk. I could see the blood being pulled out of his veins and arteries, the thin, old skin pressing in on itself under the pressure as the son finished consuming the last few drops of vital life essence given to him by his father. The body of the thing that had once been Jeremiah Lands vibrated with shimmering electricity, raising the hairs on my arms.\n\n“Come to us, queen,” he said, his voice growing louder and stronger as he spoke. “The insects welcome you home.”\n\nFrom outside the window, a booming voice began to roar. I looked out the window and saw a dragon there, its skin fiery red, its huge black eyes staring into the window as it spoke.\n\n“I am the first and the last,” it said, making my ears ring from the sheer force of its voice, “the alpha and the omega, and this world is mine. We shall fill the oceans with the blood of the believers. Open the portal, Jeremiah, and let us bring a new world to humanity.” Jeremiah walked over to the broken window and began smashing the wall open with his black fists, using a superhuman speed and strength to knock the wood out. It flew down thirteen stories, clattering on the sidewalk below, and as I looked through it, I realized that I was no longer solely in the alien world of the ritual. I could see the buildings of the town, the streets and streetlights, along with countless people rushing out of their houses and yelling in panic as they stared up at the red dragon and the thousands of huge insects, snakes and scorpions that rapidly descended upon them. The sky had returned to the one I knew, with stars and a full moon shining brightly, but the swarms of flying monsters soon blocked out all of it.\n\nI heard countless alarms and police cars in the distance, and the wail of what sounded like a tornado siren. The town had certainly begun to notice what was going on, and they rightly were terrified beyond belief. As I looked out the broken wall, I saw tiny figures in the distance carried off by huge dragonflies, bitten in half by giant snakes or stung to death by scorpions the size of a bus.\n\n“The queen dragon welcomes you,” Jeremiah said, turning his thrumming body towards me and looking down at me with his single milky eye. “Will you take the mark of the beast? Only those who follow the queen and have her mark will be free from the stinging horrors.” Jeremiah showed me his hand, where a seven-pointed star was engraved into his palm, red light shining out of it as if illuminated by an inner fire. I looked around at all the people dying, the screams fading away, and I knew I had no choice. I ran.\n\nI knew the Angel Trace complex better than anyone, and it saved me. Jeremiah sprinted after me, but my head-start and my knowledge of the twists and turns of its dilapidated halls let me escape him within a couple minutes. I ran down the floors, heading to the basement. I hid in an old industrial elevator lift that had been built into the structure, slamming the metal door shut behind me and hiding in my own private bunker.\n\nI hid there for what felt like days. As the thirst and hunger began to weaken me, I knew I had to leave or die. I left, walking slowly up the stairs and peering out the front door.\n\nBodies were strewn all over the streets, but the monsters and the red dragon were gone. There was no sign of Jeremiah Lands. I walked throughout the town and saw only a few living people, all having a seven-pointed star carved into the palm of their left hand. They smiled at me, but none of them said anything. I raided the local grocery store, grabbing food and bottled water, stepping over the bodies of children and their parents as I stuffed whatever I could into my pockets. Then I set out for the border of the town.\n\nI saw a perimeter of military vehicles, the bodies of soldiers strewn over the roads, many of them cut in half or swollen to twice their normal size, their bodies infested with unknown alien poisons. There was not a single police officer or soldier left alive that I saw. I tried to keep my eyes down, avoiding the chaos and bloodshed that surrounded me. I ended up cutting through the woods, walking for over ten miles until I reached the next town over.\n\nThere, everything seemed normal, though government agents manned checkpoints on all the roads leading into the town where Angel Trace was located. Police in SWAT gear and gas masks held assault rifles every few feet on the road, and they appeared to glance nervously around. I stopped an elderly woman walking out of the nearby restaurant, and said hello to her. Then I asked her what was going on. She smiled at me.\n\n“Looks like the next town over had some sort of chemical plant explosion,” she said. “The entire area is quarantined. The US military is everywhere, stopping everyone who heads in that direction.”\n\nI wondered where the red dragon had gone, where Jeremiah Lands and all those creatures from the alien world had headed. They were now in our world, and I knew they couldn’t be contained for long.\n\nAs I looked down at the old woman’s hand, I saw a seven-pointed star carved into her hand, red light shining out and giving her smile a bloody glow.\n\n“But I think we both know better,” she said to me, leaning close. “The end is near, my son. Will you come and see?”",

        "text": " \n\nThomas Jackson had reached the end of hope.\n\nFor years he’d been on the lookout for something, anything, that would show him the path to a better life. He’d been through friends, relationships, jobs, and other means of success, and nothing had worked. 22 years old and felt like a total failure, unable to make any sort of real progress in his life. Stuck in an endless feedback loop of self-pity and jealousy. \n\nHe thought about all the people he had met over the years who were successful and happy, and how much better their lives seemed to be compared to his own dull existence. It made him angry that he hadn’t been able to figure out what they had done right and he had done wrong.\n\nHe was also frustrated by the constant push from his family and friends to make something of himself, to be more successful and do better. He felt like their encouragement was actually holding him back, that if they just gave him a break he might be able to figure it out on his own. All he wanted was one chance.\n\nThe tales of other people's successes (and failures) left him feeling both envious and resentful at once, and he'd had enough of it. It seemed like they had all the answers while he was stuck in his own little world with no idea of what direction to take.\n\nMaybe it was time to give up, he thought. Maybe it was time to accept that he wasn’t going to find whatever it was that would make him successful and happy, and just settle for a mediocre life.\n\nAnd then one day, while browsing books at a local bookstore, something caught his eye. It was a book by a famous psychologist, with a long and complicated title. Thomas felt something in his gut when he saw it, a kind of connection with it he’d never felt before. He looked at the book, feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. Could this be what he was looking for?\n\nThe book’s cover was a deep dark maroon with a white outline. The title was larger than all of the book’s other text and made of golden letters \"The Golden Canon Of Life\". \n\nThe book was made from the finest paper. The red, glossy front text was embossed with gold, making it look fancy and important. The book had a sublime banality and looked both new and old.\n\nHe was about to put the book back on the shelf when he noticed a small piece of paper sticking out from the pages. He opened it up and read the words written inside.\n\n“The path to a new life begins here. Take this book, read it carefully, and find the courage to become the person you have always wanted to be.”\n\nThomas felt a chill go down his spine. Was this book really what he needed? He looked around the bookstore and saw that no one was paying attention to him. Despite his misgivings he decided to take a chance and bought the book.\n\nHe went home and opened it. As he flipped through its pages, he felt uneasy. While some of the advice seemed like typical self-help platitudes, some of the ideas and advice seemed… strange. As he read, he began to sense something dark and sinister in the book’s message.\n\nHe kept reading, and soon began to feel a growing sense of dread and excitement at the same time. The advice seemed to be telling him to do things he would never have considered before. He read on, and the feeling of dread only grew stronger. He felt himself being pulled deeper into the strange and harrowing world contained within the book’s pages.\n\nHe was unable to put it down. He read and read until the night grew late. He considered stopping, but something kept him going, as if he was being compelled to finish the book. When he finally finished, he felt a mix of fear and despair. He had never imagined that such a book could exist.\n\nWhat he had read had scared him. \n\nbut\n\nAt the same time he couldn't ignore the bizarre allure of the book.\n\nHe felt like the book was changing him in an abstract way, as if it knew about his deepest thoughts. He considered the implications of what he had read and how it would change his life. Despite his reservations, something told him this book was meant for him.\n\nThe book was a collection of hackneyed advice you'd find in popular magazines or on the internet pasted in inspiring images. The banality of the ideas and actions suggested in it's pages was coupled with a few more dark and drastic measures of changing ones life. From remaining abstinent for a year to an only meat diet.\n\nHe specifically thought about the advice within its pages that seemed to encourage turning away from loved ones and cutting them out of one's life completely. The notion seemed cruel and extreme, something Thomas could not bring himself to do. He laid awake late at night questioning why he was so drawn to this book and what kind of person would want to live such an isolated life?\n\nHe didn’t know what to do. He sat there for hours, trying to make sense of what he had read and how it could possibly be true. Could this really be the path forward? Was he willing to take such a drastic step in order to find success?\n\nHe sat in his bed and closed his eyes. Did it make sense? He had two contrasting ideas in his head battling each other. \n\nWho is to blame for failure? So far he only blamed himself, his laziness, his indecisiveness, his shyness. \n\nBut was it true? Was he lazy, indecisive, shy? Or were these feelings forced to him by his family? His overprotective mother, his \"always tired\" father who was never here for him...\n\nThe book gave him power, the book made him feel good and for the first time comfortable for who he was. Thomas looked down at it, a feeling of awe washing over him. He was surprised by how much he was drawn to it, despite its seemingly dark and disturbing content. It felt almost erotic.\n\nHe felt strangely empowered by the prospect of being able to control his own destiny and make his own decisions without having to rely on anyone else’s opinion. without giving a single fuck about his family his friends or anyone else.\n\nHe thought back to the many times when he felt discouraged from pursuing his goals or dreams due to what others thought was best for him. The book gave him an outlet, a way for him to take control of his own life. \n\nMorning came. His face wearied from staying up all night. His eyes were wide and his pupils dilated, he was tired, exhausted and his face reflected that, drooping his mouth open his eyes barely staying open from fatigue. And at the same time hyped up from the prospect of a new life.\n\nIf he wanted something, then it was up to him to go out there and get it, instead of waiting around for someone else to tell him what he should do. It felt liberating, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. \n\nHis anger and frustration towards his parents grew as he thought about their overbearing presence in his life. \n\nHe marched out of his bedroom and into the living room. His parents sat there watching television, oblivious to what was about to happen next. He stood in front of his parents, his body shaking violently as he struggled to suppress his rage but at the same time aroused from the energy his anger and hate gave him. He felt alive and strong and he could conquer the whole fucking world if he wanted to. His voice was full of venomous fury as he pushed them further than he ever had before.\n\nThomas’ mother’s expression changed from one of shock and confusion, at first, to one whose eyes began to pierce into his soul. His father looked back and forth between the two, as if unsure what to do.\n\nThe argument continued to escalate, each of them taking turns to scream at each other. Thomas was standing firm on his own beliefs, pushing back against his parents’ overbearing nature.\n\nHis father’s face turned a deep red with rage and his fists clenched tightly while his mother’s eyes blazed with anger. Thomas felt like he was in the middle of a maelstrom, barely able to keep himself standing against the hurricane of emotions.\n\nBut despite all this, he felt strangely liberated, as if for the first time in his life he was in control of his own destiny.\n\nThe shouting eventually subsided and after a few moments of silence, Thomas decided it was time to leave. He didn’t want to stay any longer and risk another argument breaking out. He looked at his parents one last time before going back to his room. A smirk appeared on his face that made made the skin on Thomas’ face stretch out, making his cheekbones sharpen, showing the red of his blood vessels.\n\nDamn, it feels so good to be alive. \n\nHe started packing up his things. He had no place to go, no friends, no money and nowhere to go but he felt like God on a Monday morning, full of energy and potential, an engine fueled from a mix of hate and hope. He heard footsteps outside his room. The door opened and his father entered.\n\nThomas, his father said, I know I've not always been here for you or your mother ... shit I'm not good with this you know? I'm not good with words or expressing feelings. Son, you have every right to be angry, but make sure you are angry at the right things. If you are having trouble, your mother and I are here to help. Put down your stuff and please come down to have a talk, there's something else bothering you, I can feel it. Let's just have a talk without shouting.\n\nAn unspeakable rage filled Thomas and he decided to physically attack his father. His father was shocked and tried to avoid him. Thomas started punching him in the face, vomiting words of inconceivable hate.\n\nHis father had enough and pushed him away from him telling him to stop. Then\n\nThomas grabbed a knife. The knife his father bought him when he was 12 to encourage him with miniature model building. The knife with witch he had build intricated small worlds, planes, automobiles, motorcycles, tanks in days of happiness. Days that would never come back.\n\nHe lunged forward, knife in hand. Thomas' anger seemed to fill the entire room, and every molecule of air was charged with tension. He felt like all his pain was coming out in this moment and he wanted nothing more than for it to be over. \n\nAnd it was over in a fraction of a second. \n\nHis father instinctively backed away. Thomas lost his step and crashed on the floor, his knife stabbing him in the throat.\n\nBlood gushed in all directions covering the floor, streams of red pulsating with every heartbeat. Slower and slower until time stopped and darkness came.\n\nThe shock of what had happened filled Thomas' father with overwhelming guilt and sadness. He fell to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably as he looked at his son's lifeless body. The same child he had watched grow up, the same child that was now gone in a flash of rage. He felt like his heart was torn apart, the pain of losing his son forever feeling like an eternity.\n\nIt was then that he noticed something. A book laying on the floor right next to his son. On the cover letters made out of gold spelling a promising title \"The Golden Canon Of Life\". A small piece of paper sticking out from the pages. He opened it up and read the words written inside.\n\n\"It's not your fault \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nit's hers\"",

        "text": "I pressed the power button.\n\n\"Set the Date/Time.\"\n\nFebuary 8th, 2023. 2 AM.\n\nThe screen was black. I picked up the camera and moved it around my room. I pulled a switch to zoom in on some moving boxes in the corner opposite to my bed. \n\nThe action was completed with a whirring sound as the zoom lens extended. I looked through the small digital screen. Everything looked faded and grainy. The box I had zoomed in on had writing in sharpie. \n\n\"Christmas decorations.\"\n\nI took a picture, and my room was lit up with the flash of the camera.\n\nThe only sound in my house was the whirring of the lens as I zoomed back out.\n\nI turned the camera around to look at the lens. It was covered in dust and I could make out a few fingerprints.\n\nI faced the tiny screen again, zooming in on my bedroom door this time.\n\nGood, it was locked.\n\nI moved my eyes across the several buttons on the camera's surface. I pressed one out of curiosity.\n\nA menu popped up, displaying a series of images. I moved through them, pushing the scroll wheel  ever so slightly so I could take a good look at each picture.\n\nPhoto one. A picture of someone's hand. Probably my sister's. Date, 2014. This one was old.\n\nPhoto two. A picture of my room. So many terrible memories. Date, 2014.\n\nPhoto three. A picture of my closet. I don't remember a closet being in that corner of the room, but it was a different house so who's to say? Date, 1980.\n\nIt must default to that when no date is set.\n\nPhoto four. A white screen with a stripe of pink down the center. Date, 2020.\n\nPhoto five. An art project I had done in 5th grade. I remember being proud of it. Date, 2014.\n\nPhoto six. Someone holding up the camera to a bathroom mirror. The person was my grandfather. Date, 2007. Not long after I was born.\n\nPhoto seven. A picture of me smiling as a baby. Date, 2024... why can you even set the date past the present on this camera? Old piece of shit.\n\nPhoto eight. A picture of my grandma curled on the floor. I remember this. My grandfather had pushed her over after an argument. I don't remember taking a picture, but my feet were in the bottom of the picture, along with my blue PJ'S.\n\nPhoto nine. Date, 2023. A picture of...\n\nNo.\n\nMy bedroom door. Not my old one, the one from just a few minutes ago, the one I zoomed in on. It was closed, but also unlocked.\n\nI immediately looked up. My door hadn't changed. I looked back down. It had changed back to photo eight. \n\nPhoto nine (again?). It was a different picture this time. My mom and her sister at a wedding; probably for a cousin of theirs or something. Date, 2005.\n\nPhotos ten through fifteen were all random pictures of either me or my sister's feet, pictures of random walls, or...\n\nPhoto sixteen was a video taken at midnight. I heard my grandfather mumbling to himself as he walked through a field. Finally, he stopped on a hill and aimed the camera downwards at a patch of dirt.\n\n\"You... bitch. You better tell no one what I did to you. I know what you're capable of, so I'm sure you know just as well that I could get this over with right now. I ain't gonna stoop to your level though, mad woman. I have fucking decency, but one more word from my grandchildren and its off to hell for you and your camera.\"\n\nPhoto seventeen. Me as a kid, once again, sitting in the middle of an empty dark room I didn't recognize, crying. Someone's thumb was covering the bottom left part of the photo. Date, 2017. Taken around 3:30 pm.\n\nPhoto eighteen. A wine glass shattered on the floor. Wine had spilled out everywhere.\n\nPhoto nineteen. A zoomed out photo of the last one. There were dozens of wine glasses shattered all over the tile floor. Date, 2023.\n\nPhoto twenty. A picture of my door again, wide open, leading into an empty void. Date, 1980.\n\nI glanced up, and the photo matched reality.\n\nMy blood ran cold, and I quickly picked up the camera and aimed it at the darkness. I took a photo, which was followed with a digital clicking sound.\n\nThe screen went dark.\n\nI screamed at the sound of the lens retracting back into place. I was met with dead silence.\n\nPhoto twenty one. A photo of my open bedroom door I had just taken. On the floor was a box. It was labeled \"Christmas decorations\". It was open.\n\nPhoto twenty two. Another photo of the box I hadn't taken. Date, nan.\n\nStanding behind the box was my grandma. I couldn't see her face, but she was holding the camera. Her dress was stained with wine.\n\nI looked up at my door in reality, but it was closed and locked as I had left it.\n\nI looked back down at the camera. My grandma was gone, but the box remained.\n\nEnough of this shit.\n\nI threw the camera as hard as I could across the room at my door. I winced and closed my eyes, expecting to hear a loud thud.\n\nI opened my eyes, but the camera was hovering in the center of my room, aimed at me. It took a picture and then quickly fell to the floor.\n\nPhoto twenty three. A picture of me as a child once again, cowering in fear on the bed I was sitting on now. The date was replaced with cursive writing.\n\n\"Don't leave your room. You know too much. Grandfather will kill you. Your sister is already dead.\"",

        "text": "It all happened a few days ago, I was cycling home as always when I suddenly heared coughing behind me. I thought nothing of it but then i heard it again, the same coughing. It's cold season where i live so coughing isn't uncommon, but this coughing evolved to something different over time. It was almost like someone was on the cusp of dying.\n\nAnd then i made the mistake of looking behind me.\n\nThere it was, laying on the ground: An almost perfect copy of me. Noone else seemed to notice him. There was something off, well, more off than an exact copy of you on the ground coughing his lungs out. He looked bad, really bad. Almost all his hair had fallen out and his teeth were rotten. His skin was a sickly green and when looking at him you could feel chills all over your body.\n\nI was horrified to say the least.\n\nHe started to fade away slowly, like he was decomposing. Only without the flies and rot. You could still see him breathing.\n\nAnd then, he started screaming, his last breath spent in agony before he disintegrated. Noone else seemed to notice.\n\nThe shock was too much, I cycled home filled with dread and unease for what this could mean. I did my normal routine but I was still thinking about the apparition, his deathly screech and the decomposing. I kept quiet through the entire evening and only answered the occasional question with yes or no. I couldn't sleep that night, I kept thinking about him. Until...\n\nAnd then i woke up. \"Damn\" I thought \"2 AM\" and went back to sleep.\n\nAnd again. \"2:40\" But this time I had heartburn. \"Nothing abnormal\" I thought to myself as I took a heartburn tablet. And just when I was about to lay down, I heard it. The screech. But before I could think anything of it, I went back to sleep.\n\nAnd for a third time, \"3:20\" But when I woke up, the spectre's bony hands loomed over me, almost touching me. Swiflty avoiding the hand I turned on the lights and wasn't able to sleep for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day i started doing some research, fueled on three and a half hours of sleep and a pitcher of coffee. \"College life.\" I thought as I chuckled to myself. Then I found it, an article describing different cases of Spektertot, first documented in Bavaria in the 1700's by dr. Gerhart Oedenberg. The article described exactly what I saw and had cases of it from all around Germanic Europe, from the southernmost points of Austria to the northen reaches of Svalbard. Anyone could be affected, from young to old.\n\nI had all I needed to know and I went out to get some food. But when I walked past the hallway mirror, I saw it, placing his decomposing hand on my head. I felt myself weaken as soon as i saw it. And I felt it. And my hair started falling out, it was like something from a nightmare, only I was awake. \"How?\" I thought, as what I tought was a mere hallucination turned out to be real.\n\nI haven't gone outside since, my skin started turning green, as I saw my own name get added to the article. I've started slowly decomposing, but with my last strength I give you this warning: Never look behind you when you hear a sound and you don't know where it comes from.\n\nIt's been a wild ride everybody, see you in the afterlife, if I even get there.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/DBHorror/)",

        "text": "My heart pounded through my chest as I ran down a steel corridor, the howls of hungry beasts following close behind me. Their guttural roars and bellows echoing off the tight walls as I quickly tried to escape. \n\nThankfully an opening presented itself and I slid into a doorway, quickly slamming the button to close it behind me. I found a spot to hide and covered my ears and mouth as they convened on the door. \n\nLuckily they couldn’t even dent the metal, the creatures eventually moved on, their fury subsiding as they lost interest. But now I was trapped in this tiny box of a room with no escape. My eyes fell upon a wall of screens, displaying images too horrible to comprehend, and the control panel beneath it that seemed to mock me with its endless rows of buttons and keys.\n\nTrembling, I rose to my feet and approached the towering mountain of monitors, my eyes drawn to the countless displays from the labyrinthine network of cameras that surveyed the tunnels and laboratories.\n\nWith every flicker of the monitors, my blood ran cold as I bore witness to the ruthless slaughter and degradation that had consumed the entire facility. Every image was a haunting reminder of the horrors that had taken place, leaving nothing but death and destruction in their wake.\n\nIn this underground laboratory, we deluded ourselves into thinking we were playing God. Our goal was to create a flawless hybrid of human and animal, seeking to imbue ourselves with their exceptional abilities. \n\nThe plan was to merge their genetic code with our own, but the process took a dark turn when a planted virus infiltrated the procedure. This was not just any virus, but a vicious entity that had one singular goal - to infect and spread, leaving nothing but chaos in its wake. \n\nAnd now as I gazed upon the aftermath of our experiments, I watched the fatal error of our ambition, and the terrible price that was paid for our arrogance.\n\nIn the corridors and labs of the facility, beasts of varying degrees of mutation prowled, preying upon anyone they came across. Their transformation had turned them into instruments of death, and they relished in the violence as they unleashed their monstrous abilities upon those who dared cross their path. Their victims were often the very scientists who had brought them into existence, now powerless against the horrors they had unleashed.\n\nThey were monstrosities, a grotesque fusion of animal and human DNA. Some had pincers for limbs, resembling crabs. Others walked on all fours like deer or wild boars. And there were those who scurried up the walls like spiders, their limbs distorted into arachnid appendages.\n\nThey relentlessly hunted down their prey, tearing them apart with tooth and claw. With each limb they lost, they grew another in its place, becoming even more twisted and deformed as time went on. Their bodies were constantly changing, mutating beyond recognition as they feasted on the flesh of their victims. They were the ultimate incarnation of violence and terror, and they reveled in their power to destroy.\n\nMy intentions behind all this were pure, to safeguard our species from extinction. But now, as I witness the horrors that I have unleashed, I can only feel regret and a sense of having doomed us all to a fate worse than death.\n\nTrapped within the confines of my secure chamber, I was not immune to watching the consequences of my actions. The abominations were unstoppable, tearing through the halls and leaving destruction in their wake. I was a prisoner to the scene of mass carnage, forced to bear witness to the horrors that I had helped unleash. And yet, I could do nothing to stop it. The weight of my guilt was suffocating, as I was forced to confront the true extent of the horrors I had set in motion.\n\nThose who had yet to be infected tried to survive in their own ways. Some cowered in hiding, hoping that the nightmare would pass. Others barricaded themselves inside rooms or closets, trying to fend off the inevitable. But none of them had the strength or the means to fight back. The abominations were too powerful, their abilities beyond our comprehension. In the end, we had achieved the very thing we had set out to prevent. We were helpless, at the mercy of these beings that we ourselves had created.\n\nBut there was a glimmer of dark hope, a last resort that we had kept hidden away. \n\nProject Failsafe was our backup plan, the key to stopping the creatures before they could escape and wreak havoc upon the world above. It was my last bastion of hope, the only thing standing between us and utter destruction. I clung to that hope, even as I watched the abominations tear through the facility.\n\nOne day early in the labs creation, a young and brilliant scientist had a vision of using robotics to extend human life. He was praised for his groundbreaking research and soon rose through the ranks to become the head of development in the project. But tragedy struck when he suddenly fell ill to a mysterious affliction of the body.\n\nDespite the efforts of the best medical minds, no cure could be found for his condition. Determined to continue his work though, he made the ultimate sacrifice, allowing his colleagues to transfer his consciousness into a cutting-edge military level mechanical body. The procedure was delicate, but they succeeded in preserving the brilliant mind that had once inhabited a flesh and blood vessel.\n\nBut things took a dark turn when they tried to activate his new form. His mind was unstable, consumed by an uncontrollable rage. He wreaked havoc in the robotics department, his metallic body fueled by an insatiable bloodlust. Kitted with the best weapons and tools science had at the time, he was a monster. \n\nDespite their attempts to subdue him, he killed nearly a hundred people in the rampage before finally being brought under control again. They locked the rogue machine away, hiding their shame at what they had unleashed.\n\nWith the weight of their guilt heavy on their shoulders, the higher-ups shut down the robotics department and refocused their efforts on biological research. But they never forgot about their creation, the monster hidden in their midst. They kept him locked away, a last resort in case his deadly abilities were ever needed again. \n\nI made up my mind. The time has come to unleash their monster once more, in a desperate bid to stop the new horrors they've unleashed upon the world. I had no choice anymore. \n\nHitting some keys I stared at the display, watching as the bright lights flickered to life inside the chamber. \n\nThe silence was deafening as I gazed at the massive form, standing tall and ominous in the center of the room. The black steel exterior was as dark as midnight, but the brilliant crystal skull container gleamed like a beacon on his head, a symbol of the unbridled power contained within. It was as if I was looking into the very soul of the beast, the mind that had once driven him to madness and violence. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come. For better or for worse, the fate of the world now lay in the hands of this monster.\n\nAfter inputting my admin code into the console in front of me, I took a deep breath before pressing the button to jumpstart his functions again. \n\nThe hum of electricity filled the room as his systems activated once again, the bright lights in his head flickering to life. I held my breath, watching in apprehension as his metallic arms slowly rose, his fingers twitching as they adjusted to their newfound mobility. A low growl rumbled from his chest, and I felt my heart pounding as I prepared for the worst. \n\nThe robotic figure took its first step forward, its metal body creaking with every movement. I held my breath, waiting for any signs of the unstable mind taking over, but for a moment, it seemed like the startup was going smoothly. \n\nThen, without warning, the mechanical beast let out an electronic ear-piercing scream and lunged at the camera, shattering it with a single blow. The image flickered and died, leaving me in complete darkness.\n\nTrying to find where he’d go, the surveillance feeds flickered on the monitors, each one showcasing a different nightmarish scene. Corpses littered the halls, torn apart by the claws and jaws of the mutated monstrosities. I frantically scanned through the feeds, searching for any glimpse of the metallic monster. \n\nAnd then, there it was, a hulking tower of black steel, marching through the chaos with relentless determination. Its glowing eyes scanned the surroundings with a cold gaze, hunting for its next victim. The suspense was palpable as I watched in horror, knowing that it would unleash its unbridled rage on anything that crossed its path. \n\nFinally, he came across a group of the fresher corpses turned animalistic. They were a circus of distorted body parts, some crab men scurried along the walls while more brutish wolf-men stood in a pact blocking the hallway. They snarled and barked at Failsafe, wary of his intimidating posture and cold gaze. \n\nFailsafe didn't flinch at their threats though, his metallic body coiled with strength as he prepared to unleash a barrage of destruction. The wolf-men pounced first, their razor-sharp claws ready to tear apart their prey. \n\nThe main leader lunged at him, quickly being caught in the iron grip of Failsafe’s hands. He squeezed gently and popped the skull of the alpha like it was an egg. White fragments and flesh splatted on the walls and stained his metal chassis red. The rest of the wolf-men were undeterred and charged him in one big motion. But they were met with a crushing blow as Failsafe swung his metal fist, decimating the first wave of attackers turning them into meat mist. \n\nThe crab-men were next, their pincers clicking as they scurried towards him on many pairs of legs. But their attempts to surround him were thwarted as Failsafe unleashed a barrage of bullets from his built-in arsenal, incinerating them in a hail of fire and shrapnel.\n\nThe remaining animal men snarled and charged, their feral eyes filled with hatred for this metallic intruder. Failsafe didn't hold back, unleashing a flurry of punches and kicks as he fought his way through the horde with terrifying power turning the opponents into paste. \n\nBlood splattered across the walls as he broke bones and tore apart flesh, his relentless barrage never slowing as he carved a path of destruction through the twisting halls.\n\nIt wasn't long before more groups were attracted to Failsafe's presence. The man-spiders had taken to webbing hallways, densely packing them with sticky strings. Failsafe's metallic body began to glow red with the heat of his integrated flamethrower as he marched through the webbed halls, his enemies emerging from the shadows to attack.\n\nWith a flick of his wrist, Failsafe unleashed a blazing inferno that lit up the hallway, the man-spiders screeching as they burned to ashes. The heat was intense, singeing the walls and burning the webs as Failsafe continued to march forward, determined to eradicate every last one of these mutated freaks.\n\nIn a blaze of glory, he stood tall amidst the smoldering remains of his foes, the flamethrower hissing as it cooled. And with a final roar, he set off to find and eliminate the source of this twisted horror, determined to cleanse the labs of any living filth he could find.\n\nFailsafe's relentless march forward was met with fierce resistance by the twisted and mutated beings that now roamed the laboratories. A horde of boar-like monsters, their bodies contorted and distorted into grotesque shapes, charged towards the mechanical giant with all the ferocity of a wild beast. But Failsafe was not deterred. With fluid and precise movements, he swiftly dispatched the oncoming threat, leaving their lifeless bodies in his wake.\n\nNext, a group of serpentine creatures slithered out of the shadows, their scales glinting in the dim light. They moved with lightning-fast speed, attempting to ambush the metallic colossus from all sides. But their efforts were for naught, as Failsafe's advanced thermal vision easily picked up their presence, and with a swift swipe of his weapons, he carved through the lizards like they were made of butter. Their diced corpses wriggling on the ground as he moved on. \n\nThese monstrous beings were no match for the power of the integrated robotics, and one by one they fell under the weight of his mechanical might. \n\nI observed with a mixture of fear and fascination as the machine man advanced through the labyrinthine laboratory and approached the central auditorium, close to where I was concealed. The room was pitch black, but I quickly illuminated it with the overhead lights, revealing the horror that lay before him. \n\nThere was a hulking elephant-like creature, a formidable force that defied the laws of nature. Towering over its surroundings, its massive body was a patchwork of flesh, each section sewn together from the remains of hundreds of different people. Its wrinkled gray hide was dotted with bulging veins and mottled with matted fur, some of it black, some of it white. The creature had an elephant's trunk, but it was elongated and twisted, like a writhing tentacle. It had tusks, but they were massive, sharpened to deadly points, and stained with the blood of countless victims. Its eyes glowed with an inner fire, reflecting the insane mind of the creature inside. It bellowed a deafening roar, announcing its presence to the world, as it prepared to wreak havoc on anything that dared to stand in its way.\n\nThe two behemoths locked eyes, each sizing up the other before launching into a brutal battle of bodies. The elephant creature swung a massive tusk, aimed directly at Failsafe's head. But the metal man was quick, dodging the blow with ease before unleashing a series of devastating punches at lightning speeds. The hulking monster roared in anger, its massive form shaking the very foundations of the laboratory. But Failsafe was relentless and fearless, raining down blow after blow down upon the creature, each strike echoing through the room like thunder.\n\nThe two battled in a close duel, exchanging blows and grappling with each other in a desperate struggle for dominance. Failsafe was unrelenting, his massive fists slamming into the creature's flesh with enough force to shake the room I was in. Slowly but surely, the monster's resistance began to wane, its form growing weaker with each passing moment.\n\nWith his huge fists, he pounded the elephant-like being, causing deep wounds that oozed and spurted dark red blood.\n\nAnd with a final, mighty blow, Failsafe sent the creature crashing to the ground, its massive body heaving as it tried to catch its breath. The metal man stood victorious, his hands bloody and his chest heaving as he looked down upon his defeated foe. And with a final roar of triumph, Failsafe turned his back on the broken creature, setting his sights on his next target as he strode deeper into the laboratory and towards my direction. \n\nPanic gripped me as I stared, horrified, at the security feeds. An unstoppable killing machine hacked and slashed his way through the very tunnels I had traversed just before, leaving a trail of dead creatures behind him. And now, he was standing right outside my door, standing there ominously .\n\nI huddled beneath the console, every muscle in my body tensed with fear. I was paralyzed by the thought of what would happen if the intruder breached the room. The silence was deafening, broken only by my soft whimpers. Suddenly, I heard a soft, terrifying tapping at the door. It was as if Death itself was knocking. \n\nThe gentle taps transformed into pounding, as the cyborg tried to break down the door. I screamed, begging for it to stop, pleading for a reprieve from death. But the door was no match for the relentless assault, and I knew that my fate was sealed. With each impact, I felt my resolve crumble, until all that was left was a frightened whisper, begging for a miracle that would never come.\n\nWith resignation, I rose to my feet and gazed upon the console. I realized that I could not run from my fate any longer. It was time to face the monster, to confront the inevitable. Steeling myself, I walked towards the door and pressed the button to open it, ready to face Failsafe and my destiny head-on.\n\nI stepped out from behind the door, meeting his cold, unyielding gaze. The air was thick with tension, as we stood there in silence, each sizing up the other. For what felt like an eternity, we held each other's gaze, neither of us daring to make the first move.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, Failsafe's expression softened. Without a word, it turned and began to walk away, its massive form retreating into the shadows. I was stunned, unable to believe that I had been spared. I stood there, watching as Failsafe disappeared, until all that was left was a  corpse filled hallway and the sound of my own rapid breathing.\n\nTrembling with fear, I hit the button once more, returning my gaze to the monitors. As I watched, the metallic beast slink away, its hunger for destruction and carnage stronger than ever before. The shadows seemed to close in around it, like a hungry predator, as it disappeared into the darkness, seeking out its next victim. The thought of its relentless pursuit filled me with dread, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was only a matter of time before it returned. \n\nThis is why I’m sending this message on the console, to hopefully give a warning to those beyond these walls. Our failures have brought us to this point, and if the virus or He should escape, it will be the innocent who pay the price for our arrogance. I pray for your safety, for we have not only failed ourselves, but also those who will bear the burden of our mistakes. Our hubris has brought us to this brink, and I fear for what may come if we do not act now. We have failed ourselves down here, but most of all, we have failed you.",

I'm not used to staying up this late.\n\nI think I might be helping someone or something powerful commit robberies in my city.\n\nI see it on the news. Six robberies over the past five days.\n\nSomething changed this morning. In the way they're talking about the robberies. \n\nSomeone died. A security guard. They had a family. \n\nLet me back up.\n\nMy parents were happy people.\n\nThey met in high school. Got pregnant at 18. Had my sister. Then got married.\n\nThey didn't go to college. My dad went to work in the P&amp;G factory as a laborer.\n\nEight years later, they had me at 26.\n\nThey love us and have tried to give us a better life, but the years of financial stress have left them shells of themselves. I know we struggle to pay our house payment every month.\n\nI can tell it weighs on them.\n\nThey were once happy, beautiful people.\n\nI have a polaroid of them from when they brought me home from the hospital.\n\nIn an apartment. They’re smiling so big and wide.\n\nI’m so small in their arms, I try not to cry when I look at it.\n\nI can’t tell them what I’ve done. \n\nI want them to be happy again.\n\nHe approached me at the gym after I finished lifting. I'm rehabbing a shoulder injury from pitching.\n\nIt had to be close to 11pm.\n\nI was alone in the sauna.\n\nHe stood outside of it. He waited for me to nod that it was okay for him to join me.\n\nI didn’t think anything of it.\n\nWhen he entered, the steaming hot sauna went ice cold.\n\nI passed out.\n\nI woke up, knowing I had made a deal.\n\nI knew the details of the deal. I had agreed to it. He promised money. $800 a night.\n\nI even knew what I needed to buy from CVS on my way home to draw it and keep it warm.\n\nI also knew he had just gotten into town. He got into Lifetime with a guest pass.\n\nBut we never actually talked.\n\nI went home that night and started the routine.\n\nI’ve been draining a pint of my blood into a thermos every night for him. He picks it up at 2am and leaves a new thermos behind for me.\n\nI’ve made $4,000 for my parents. I’ve been telling myself it's okay. \n\nI was planning on giving it to my parents on their anniversary this weekend. I thought they could catch up on bills. Maybe they could plan a vacation together.\n\nBut how can this be okay? The bank robbery this morning...\n\nThe police aren't putting out any more information about what happened. They said they'll release more information soon.\n\nSome expensive stores and a bank have shut down for the rest of the week.\n\nMaybe he wasn’t involved.\n\nMaybe I should confront him.\n\nHe’s here. I have to go.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10u2x6s/theres_a_noise_downstairs/)\n\n(current time of typing 10:21pm.)\n\nIt’s happening again. The noise downstairs, with that demon. \n\nThat’s what someone said last time, plenty of people have left comments for me to read, and one stuck out, and I took their comment to heart. They had also replied to my comment about my roommate being a witch, but I think it was deleted, which sucks. \n\nAnyways, in my last post, I forgot to mention a few things about my roommate. She practices witchcraft. Not in a bad way, I don’t think. But, I asked her to perform a spell, and told her what happened. Of course, and thankfully, she never questioned me or my story, which was a relief for me, but I also had a mixed set of emotions. I genuinely hope she’s not the problem, if it is, I will do anything I can to make it stop because she’s frankly the best thing in my life right now. I’ve been unemployed for the last two months, and since the household expenses are genuinely very cheap, (I think everything including rent, is only about $900 per/month) she’s been a real hustler, and paying them, I can’t express enough how much I love her.\n\nOkay, I also wanted to provide some context for this house. The noise is downstairs, and I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t feel scared, or threatened quite yet, however, I feel it necessary to explain, as my last post (I personally feel) left little to be desired in context of the house's living condition.\n\nMy parents bought the house in 2017, I lived in it with them for about three years, until they moved out to take care of the in-laws, and my brother didn’t have a license, so that left me. I originally didn’t want the house at the ripe age of 18, primarily because the conditions of the house were not… great. The house was cheap when we bought it, it needs complete renovations everywhere. And they originally had the funds to do it, however in November of 2018, my step-dad was involved in an accident at work, and left him unable to work, leaving us with barely any income except workers comp. Let me also not forget to add that the room I am staying in was my brother's room. He has anger issues and there are holes and the walls, and the door was ripped down in one of his fits. Which explains the lack of a door I have. I took the room when my roommate moved in so she could have some privacy.\n\nAfter about two years, a pandemic issues, months of mental problems in the pursuit of ‘finding myself’ (I still haven’t found myself yet.) Crying, and my 20th birthday (2021 in this timeline), I finally agreed. At the time, I lived with my grandma (I moved out for a brief period to help her out with surgery recovery which lasted for a year somehow), I packed up my old little PT Cruiser (rest in pieces \\[yes like that\\] to her,) took my cat and started a life. I realized the great opportunity that had presented itself to me. I’m young, I know how to manage my money really well, and even working a job that pays $14 an hour, I could somehow comfortably live in this thing at peace. \n\nEventually, I did get a new job at a warehouse that paid $20 per/hour, and I was even better. \n\nI noticed small things. Irrelevant at the time. And I’m already an incredibly paranoid person, but I shoved it off. I live in the country, the corn fields directly behind me, in a little town (actually it's considered to be a village). Noise is bound to happen. Eventually, I did learn to relax with my cat. My trashy house that needs fixed. I relaxed and learned to live with the unfinished wood in the downstairs, the steep-barely attached basement steps that could collapse at any time. I learned to love the crappy installed windows, and the front door that barely latches half the time. Because it was *mine*. \n\nAt work, I was moved to a new department, a promotion of sort, but not with money, but of respect. And that’s when I met Samantha. \n\nJune of 2022. She trained me, and instantly we cliqued. \n\nLike I knew her since I was a kid. We are constantly in sync. Know what we want, and at the time, I genuinely considered her my best friend. Sam moved in with me in August.\n\nI still do consider her my best friend by the way. Which is why I felt no shame in telling her about the other night. She totally understood, and performed a spell, and I’m still in consideration as to if it worked or not. \n\nNow, I know you’re wondering, “Where is it now?”\n\nIt’s opening and closing the basement door. \n\nOpen. Close. Open. Close.\n\nLike a toddler learning the basics of the door, and playing with it.\n\nOpen. Close. Open. Close. Open–\n\nThe cat’s just ran upstairs, and they’re not fighting. Now I’m starting to get scared. \n\nTo keep myself occupied for as long as I can (and as we’re speaking about doors). I did end up getting my brother's old door back on the hinges, the problem is that it doesn't latch, but I can put something heavy behind the door to make sure it stays closed.\n\nI’m keeping my light on. I don’t know if that’s gonna help anything, but the last time I think my light being on, really helped the thing stay out. But a demon is a demon, is a demon, and I’m scared that my fear will make them powerful enough to come into the light, if that’s the case. How can I not be scared of being scared? \n\nOkay, the door is closing really loudly now, and it’s starting to shake the house. It was a mere soft closing, I could hear the basement door latch softly, even from the second floor. I hope it stays there. I’d rather live with that for a few hours a night, then the constant running in circles. And I’d rather the thing not break my fucking plates. Hell, the plate he broke wasn’t even mine! It was Sam’s!! If you’re only gonna fuck with me, fuck with my shit instead, have some fucking respect. \n\nIf I’m gonna be honest though, I don’t feel like it’s going after Sam, I think it’s me it wants. I don’t know why, it’s just a feeling I have, like a sixth sense. My roommate has never experienced something like this. Not even an eerie noise that will throw her off. Just me, especially if it’s been happening long before she arrived. She’s here alone more than I ever will be (Since I’m unemployed, I go to my mom’s house most of the time to help out, and keep me occupied) But I just can’t shake the feeling as to why it wants me. \n\nIf all else fails. I have a bathroom up here that has two doors that lock. The separate room with a shower locks, and then the separate room with the toilet also locks. So, I think that should help if push comes to shove.\n\nI just positioned myself into the little concave in my room. The cats are staring at the bedroom door, and their tails are twitching. But their ears aren’t back. They’re curious, but apprehensive. Animals do wonders, and their current behavior helps keep the fear down immensely. If you can, please get a cat. They’re a bit less vocally reactive when a presence is near. God, they do wonders, and I can’t stop thanking them right now. \n\nHold on. \n\nI just realized the door hasn’t slammed shut yet. \n\nI think it’s on the first floor. \n\nI can’t hear it now, but I’m sure as hell not going downstairs until the cats creep out. This time, I will follow them. \n\nIt’s tapping on the mantle of the stairs. It’s at the bottom of the steps. I think the fucker is taunting me to go to it. Get out of the light. But I’m not going to. I think it knows that. For some reason, if it had a face, it’s probably grinning ear to ear. But I’m not moving, fuck that. I thought demons were smart. If it wants to fuck me up, it’s gonna have to try a hell of a lot harder than that. Again, I’m a paranoid person. I don’t even sleep with my TV on, I’m the lightest sleeper you will ever meet (childhood trauma that I’m not gonna get into) so if it wants to get me, It’s gonna have to drag me to hell kicking and screaming. I’ve got teeth too, so I’ll even bite, regardless of whatever demon juices infects me. \n\nIt’s talking again. Or trying to. I can’t pinpoint it. \n\nIt's groaning I think? \n\nIt said my deadname in a voice I can’t hardly recognize, but I feel like I should recognize it. \n\nIt’s tapping harder in frustration I think. It’s clearing its throat. Like it’s trying to impersonate someone I know, but I just can’t *remember who it is*.\n\nMy grandpa. It’s trying to impersonate my grandpa. \n\nBut jokes on that fucker. He died in 2016 from a heart attack, you wench. \n\nNow it’s stomping its foot on the floor, or slamming its fist on the mantle. I hope none of it cracks. \n\nYou know what, I’m gonna personify the thing, and call it Idiot. \n\nIdiot is gonna have to try harder than that to take me. \n\nOh shit, shit shit shit. I need to stop. The fear is leaving me, but an ego is taking over, this happens from time to time. But what should I feel? Feed it with my fear, or encourage myself with ego? \n\nFuck, this is hard. I need to shake my head like a cartoon character or something and not let either take over me. Ego, overconfidence will make me confront Idiot or *it,* I mean *it,* and I think personifying it could make it more powerful. But fear could be even worse, and feed it that way too. \n\nLevel-headed, that’s what I need to feel. Rational. Confidence is good, yes. But overconfidence could make it worse. Make me worse. \n\n“\\[Deadname\\], Luna is out again. And I need help getting her.”\n\nYeah no. My mom isn’t fucking here, Luna (her dog) isn’t here. \n\nIt’s saying the same thing over and over again. That same line. Idiot I MEAN ‘*IT’* *FUCK*, is getting more and more and more angry. There’s only so much I can type before I get bored or run out of words. \n\nI’m getting angry myself, frustrated even. I want to scream at it. *Fuck,* I want to confront it, but I can’t. I have to stop myself. It’s playing a trick on me. Making me feel these things. But I’m more resilient than that. \n\nYou know what? I might pull some Home Alone shit, and put up some fish wire to trip it next time it decides to run, then I can see it fall at my steps and make fun of how stupid it is. \n\nNo. No NO NO, I can’t do that. \n\nI’m gonna stop typing and wait it out. I’ll let you know if anything new happens.\n\n(11:28pm)\n\nThis is a series of things it’s trying to lure me out with.\n\nMy little cousin (again) “Bobby and pawpaw need help cousin \\[deadname\\].”\n\nFollowed with the same voice, “Mommy said if you don’t come out, she’ll find you.” \n\nConstant banging of my fucking mantle or stomping (I swear if that fucker cracks the wood, I’m gonna have a demon head hung above my bed like a trophy.) Then It started to perform the Boston Marathon by running around my house. It’s fast, stomping around as it does the weird toddler run. If it’s trying to impersonate my cousin, he’s in the wrong time period. He hadn't sounded like that since he was 6, and he’s turning 9 soon. My cousin used to run around the house like that. If you’ve been around a young kid or toddler, you know *that run*. The lack of remorse for the floors as they stomp when they fucking run. It’s pissing me off, it’s gonna fuck up my floor, which is the original fucking wood by the way. So yeah, I have a right to be pissed. \n\nIf my grandma see’s this. No. I’m not covering them up with carpet! I’m not changing the trimming, and for the love of *fucking God, I am not lowering my fucking-*\n\nOh shit. It just fucking yelled. A deep guttural one, sounded like my mom, “Come out!” It’s stomping again. \n\nI think my anger caused it. It’s feeding off of it. Oh shit oh fuck. I need to relax. I don’t need to worry about floors. I need to worry about myself, my cats. \n\nTheir ears are back now, and they are growling, hair up. No no no no.\n\n(12:35)\n\nIt’s been about an hour. \n\nI was able to calm myself down by reaching for a book and reading it outloud to myself in a calm voice. I don’t think it can get up the steps right now.\n\nHonestly, I don’t think it can do much of anything unless I overreact. \n\nLast time, I was scared shitless, and I think my fear gave it enough energy to get up the steps, but not enough to confront me. Tonight, anger is making it’s vocals more dramatic, but somehow less realistic. This could explain the difference between people that it communicates to me with. \n\nFear: My little cousin, step climbing.\n\nAnger/overconfidence: Tone and overall energy that I feel.\n\nI think it’s reflecting my anger towards my mom. It thinks, if I hear my mom, I’ll be scared enough to feed off me, and in turn, use my fear to climb the steps. However, my over compassion for my cousin let’s me want to confront it, leading to my ego and overconfidence. \n\nI don’t know why it choose my grandpa. I’m sure the thing knows he’s dead. Actually, now that I typed that, I think personifying it might become more real in my word, thus more able to get me. \n\nSo, in conclusion, level headedness, and rationality is my best bet. \n\n* dont get too extreme with my emotions.\n\nIs the simple term I guess. See!! I can be smart sometimes!!\n\nNo new updates though. It’s still thrumming against the mantle or floor, it’s not as intense. I’ll give info when I can. \n\n(2:24am)\n\nThe cats went downstairs about 45 minutes ago. I feel relief and I feel safe to go about my night. \n\nThank you for coming along with me, and letting me vent my frustrations here. And, if you’re wondering. No. I did not follow them. I know better.\n\nI did end up going to the bathroom, and I could see the bottom of the stair, but I have zero intention of going back down there tonight, or at least until Sam gets back from work. I think my lack of intention saved me if the thing is still down there trying to lure me. I heard it close the basement door with a loud slam, and it definitely shook the house and made me jump.\n\nAgain, thank you for those commenting on my situation and giving me advice or commenting at all, thanks for hearing that long context thing at the beginning. I’m probably not gonna post this until tomorrow just in case something does happen again. So read this in the past tense?? Even though this doesn’t read like it. \n\nI’ll update you when I can. I had a sense of hope that this wouldn’t be a series, but here we are.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you’re reading this, odds are that I’m already gone, and you’re experiencing the same thing I was. All I have is one piece of advice for you, do NOT open the door. It sounds cliche, but once you hear my story, you’ll understand.\n\nIt started with me heading to the bar with some friends. We were all having a good time, drinking and hollering at every pretty woman we saw. Eventually, we got too rowdy, and they kicked us out, leaving us to stumble our way home. \n\nI had to get home soon anyway, my cat doesn’t feed himself after all. I still had a takeaway cup from the bar, which I was taking sips from. Looking back on it now, not getting a lid for it was the the dumbest fucking thing I ever did.\n\nI was stumbling back home, when all of a sudden, I saw a figure at the end of the street. They were standing just outside of a street light so that I could not make out their appearance. My eyes struggled to focus on the mysterious figure. Suddenly, they walked into the light, revealing…\n\nA well dressed man. He wore a plain brown suit and tie, brown dress pants, and black dress shoes. Finally being able to see him, I relaxed and continued to press on home. I noticed how the man also began to walk so that we were heading towards each other. \n\nThe *clop clop clop* of his shoes against the pavement was almost deafening, even from this distance. Each one of his footfalls made my head pound, making me stumble more and more. When we were within mere feet of each other, each step sent my world into chaos and misery. \n\nAs we passed, I finally lost my footing, and fell directly into him, my whiskey spilling all over his fine clothes. I hit the ground, hard. I stared up at the dark sky, watching the stars twinkle like diamonds up above. Then, another view came into my vision.\n\nThe man was staring down at me, a fiery glow in his eyes and a look of pure malice on his face. As his eyes met mine, an icy chill coursed through my body. I could feel something awful emanating from him as his eyes stared deeper into mine, this man seemingly cursing me with all his might. Then I blinked.\n\nI was in my bed. The sun was shining through my window and my clock read 9:30 am.  I wiped the sleep from my eyes and looked around confused. My cat, Beef, sat at the foot of my bed, grumpy that he had not been fed yet. But all I could think about was the man I had seen last night. I could still see, no, *feel* his eyes staring into mine. That chill that I had felt still resonated within me, and that awful energy radiating off of him seemed to linger in the air. \n\nNevertheless, I had chores to do and a cat to feed. I got up and walked to the kitchen, opened the cabinet and poured some food into Beef’s bowl. That’s when I heard it.\n\nA tap on the window behind me, just loud enough to be heard. I wheeled around, startling Beef. I expected to see the man there, still staring at me. But there was nothing.\n\nThat was just the beginning.\n\nOver the next few weeks, small things began to happen, be it a tap on the window or a knock at my door. Eventually, just when I began to question my own sanity, the voices began, always speaking from behind a door I was near to. Whenever I went to open the door, some primal sense in me told me not to, so I had to resist the temptation.\n\nAt first, they were speaking in unintelligible gibberish. But with each passing encounter, their words and voices began to form. They had the voices of everyone I loved. My parents, my grandparents, my brothers, my sister, my aunts and uncles, and so many more. They tormented me for weeks, screaming, begging, pleading for me to just open that damned door, to let them in.\n\nThey all had a different reason for me to let me in. *“I’m hurt!”* My mother screamed. *“There’s someone chasing me!”* My brother yelled in desperation. *“The house is on fire!”* cried my father. *“It’s so cold out.”* My sister hauntingly stated.\n\nThen one day, a new voice joined the symphony of horror. It was, my own voice. It joined in with the others, now demanding that I open the door, ordering me to just let. Them. In.\n\nAs I write this now, I can’t take it anymore. They’re at my bedroom door. I’m going to open it. I need to end this misery.",

        "text": "  \nI had just gotten an old radio from a thrift shop.\n\nMy dad and I often go to swap meets, flea markets, and yard sales. He’s really into collecting old junk, especially radios. I usually just buy comic books or whatever, but this time I just had to get this antique tombstone radio. My dad has about twenty radios ranging from the shiny silver to classic wood-grain, but this was the first one I purchased. I eagerly set it up on the table at the foot of my bed.\n\nThat night, the moonlight poured in through my window and its soft glow illuminated the radio dial. I tuned it to an oldies station and laid back on my bed looking upwards out the window at the full moon hanging bright in the sky. The oldies station came through as clear as crystal.\n\nPatsy Cline’s “*Walkin' After Midnight*” came and went as I relaxed in this pleasant environment. A few other country classics made their way across the airways before I even knew it.\n\nSuddenly, as the next song began, I heard something peculiar. It was a low near-whispering voice.\n\nI listened closer and I could hear that the voice was softly singing along to the song being played on the radio. This continued on as the song finished and the next song came on. It was a low monotone, almost in complete whisper, singing along to every song that would play.\n\nI thought perhaps it could be the radio disc jockey singing along. My dad once told me about a DJ who walked in and closed the door mid-song by mistake, which we both thought was pretty funny at the time.\n\nThis however, seemed solemn and creepy. It was the listless tone of a broken singer who could barely carry a tune. The sorrow emanating from the voice was more than the greats of the country western genre could communicate. This odd monotone voice singing in the background was somehow alarming, as it invaded my peace, and sent chills throughout me. It conveyed a certain world-weariness and hearing it felt like listening in on a stranger's private conversation or overhearing someone singing along under their breath when they don't know you're listening.\n\n“*Alone and Forsaken*” by Hank Williams began to play from the old fabric speakers. The low anomalous singer once again began to sing along softly, growing gradually louder as it continued. He sang as if he wholeheartedly believed every word of the song. Along with the sadness was a sinister feeling, an uneasiness that likely came from me not knowing where this odd voice had come from. I began to feel as if I wasn’t alone in the room, as if a stranger was there with me. I was thoroughly freaked out and the more I listened the more I got the creeps.\n\nI went into the living room to find my dad sitting in his recliner by one of his radios. I told him to tune it to that station I’d been listening to, but when he did, it was normal, and there was no other voice. In my utter confusion, I tried to explain what I heard but he had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nWhen I returned to my room, the voice was gone from the radio. I laid back on my bed once more gazing up at the sky. The full moon had disappeared behind a black cloud, leaving the sky blank and empty. My radio and I sat alone in the dark undisturbed.\n\nI haven't had anything like that happen since then. I switched to a station that only plays the new hits.\n\nI suppose whoever was singing doesn't know those songs.",

        "text": "Case Number: 03011984\n\nDate: February 8, 2023\n\nReporting Officer: Deputy Blackwell\n\n Prepared By: Deputy Blackwell\n\nIncident Type: Missing Persons/Possible Kidnapping\n\nAddress of Occurrence: 557 Maple Street\n\nWitnesses:\n\nJulie Mitchelle: Waitress - Steven's Bistro, 23, Caucasian\n\nPhillip Neman - 911 Call operator, 42, African American \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn February 8, 2023, at around 18:45, Steven Wilson and his wife, Carla Wilson, were seen leaving Steven's Bistro. It was reported by their waitress, Julie Mitchelle, the couple were having a hostel dinner that included yelling and abrupt banging on the table. Ms. Mitchelle says she had to ask the couple multiple times to keep their voices down. Ms. Mitchelle reports that the couple eventually calmed down and finished their meal quietly, leaving the restaurant around 20:00. \n\nIt is presumed the couple drove straight to their home at 557 Maple Street. At approximately 20:23, a person identifying themselves as Carla Wilson contacted 911 Emergency Services. The operator she spoke to, Phillip Neman, reported that Mrs. Wilson stated in her call that an unknown woman was standing in her driveway. Mr. Neman says he instructed Mrs. Wilson to stay on the line and in her vehicle. During their conversation, Mr. Neman could hear Mrs. Wilson interact with an unidentified male, believed to be Mr. Wilson. At approximately 20:26, Mr. Neman reported that Mrs. Wilson screamed. When asked what prompted this, she said that their babysitter, Ms. Rebecca Wells, had come outside and startled them. Mrs. Wilson then stated that the unknown woman was no longer in sight. Mrs. and Mr. Wilson instructed their babysitter to go inside. Mr. Neman said that the Wilsons had a private conversation that Mr. Neman couldn't hear. It was at this point, 20:30, that Mrs. Wilson hung up. Mr. Neman tried calling her back, but no one answered. \n\nThe events that transpired from the ending of the 911 call and when I, Deputy Blackwell, arrived are unknown. I came to the residence of Mr. Steven Wilson and Carla Wilson at 557 Maple Street at approximately 20:37. I exited my cruiser and approached the carport of the Wilson's home, where the intruder was initially reported. On inspection of the driveway, I didn't observe any person or persons as reported to 911. I did observe an unattended vehicle, a 2011 Hyundai Elantra. At this point, I noticed the side door to the home was ajar. I announced myself and knocked on the door. \n\nAfter hearing no response, I entered the residence of 557 Maple Street at approximately 20:42. Upon entering the residence, I noticed no lights in the house and removed my flashlight. After activating my flashlight, I shined the light around the home's doorway as I entered the home. I continued shining the light about the house but did not observe any sign of disturbance. I continued my way into the living room, where I witnessed 5 people seated in the living room. I once again announced myself, but again, I received no response. I approached the 5 seated people and announced myself a final time. As I reached the 5 seated persons, I observed two male minors, later identified as Bennet Wilson and Hutton Wilson, and two older females, Carla Wilson and Rebecca Wells. The 5th person was Steven Wilson. The 5 people were seated upright with their eyes and mouths open. I attempted to contact any of the 5 people but received no response. I didn't observe any outward wounds or signs of distress on the people. I noticed that, except for Mr. Wilson, none of the other people appeared to be breathing. At approximately 20:51, I requested additional emergency services to render aid. After I got off the radio with emergency services, I attempted to contact Mr. Wilson. He seemed non-responsive until I shined my flashlight into his eyes, at which point Mr. Wilson screamed and attacked me. I was forced to subdue him. Mr. Wilson seemed confused about where he was. He kept asking who I was and where he was. After handcuffing Mr. Wilson, I stood up and noticed the 4 other people were now standing up. Their mouths and eyes were wide open, and their hands were raised defensively. All of them shared the same pose. Mr. Wilson continued to scream, and I asked him to remain silent and to tell his family to sit down. Mr. Wilson insisted his family was upstairs. I told him they were standing around him. Mr. Wilson seemed confused and stated he didn't see them. I tried to make contact with Mrs. Wilson, but she was non-responsive. I became aware of a presence in the far corner of the room. An older unidentified woman. I cannot confirm if she had always been standing there or had arrived in my subduing of Mr. Wilson. I shined my light on the woman and took a few steps in her direction. She remained in the same static pose as the others. I returned my attention to the Wilson family, who had all collectively turned and were now facing my direction. I removed my taser and instructed them to lie face down. None of them complied. I was unsure of how to proceed in the presence of minors. I backed up to keep the woman and the 4 people in my view. The woman had inched closer in my direction while I had moved my focus to the Wilsons. Since she was separate from the children, I instructed the woman to drop to her knees and put her hand behind her head. Mr. Wilson began screaming that the woman was not human and was a danger. I asked Mr. Wilson to control his outburst and remain silent. The woman refused to comply. I admit I had reservations about approaching the woman, given the lack of lighting and the unusual nature of the call. I pointed my taser at the woman and gave her a final warning to comply. The woman didn't move, so I fired my taser. It seems to have no effect on the woman. I attempted another electrical surge in the taser, but my flashlight malfunctioned momentarily and went dark. I tapped the light on the wall, and when it came back on, the woman and the 4 people near the sofa had all gotten closer to me. I felt that I was being backed into a corner and attempted to use the taser a third time. My flashlight malfunctioned once again, but when I banged the flashlight against the wall, the light remained off. I dropped the taser and tried to get the flashlight working again. After a few moments, the light came on, and I was face-to-face with the woman. She was a foot from my face. The 4 people from the sofa also encircled me. They weren't moving and remained in the same frozen position. I removed my firearm and instructed them to back away. Again, there was non-compliance from the 5 people. I instructed Mr. Wilson to ask his family to step back for safety. Mr. Wilson again insisted no one was in the room with us. I told him to stop playing games if he wanted his family to remain safe. Mr. Wilson became distraught and said it was too late for that. I forcibly shoved the unknown woman away and raised my firearm. The woman didn't budge or react. I demanded she back away. Still no reaction. My flashlight began to flicker. I dreaded what was about to happen. The light went off, and the room went black, but then yellow flashing lights illuminated the house as the ambulance arrived. I see the woman stare right back at me. With every flash of yellow, she seemed to move an inch closer in the darkness until her cold skin touched mine. The front door opened, and the lights from the ambulance flooded the house. I was temporally blinded as my eyes adjusted. The EMT, Samantha Wayne, asked me to lower my weapon. I told her I couldn't because of the threat of the people around me. The EMT asked what people? As my eyes adjusted, I could no longer see the woman or the 4 others. I told the EMT to remain outside until the premises could be secured. I again searched the house but could find no sign of the woman, the Wilson family, or the babysitter. Once I determined the house to be secure, I allowed the EMT to come in and examine Mr. Wilson. He had become unresponsive. The EMT took his vitals and said he appeared to be in shock. Mr. Wilson was transported to St. Michaels Hospital. He is under supervision and has currently, as of this time, continued to be non-responsive. The whereabouts of the remaining Wilson family, Ms. Wells, and the unknown woman are still being investigated.",

        "text": "The darkest things live in the light.\n\nMy grandmother used to say that. Her invented idioms always seemed to carry greater weight upon reflection. I think Grandma had simply been philosophising about the monstrosity of mankind. However, it just so happened that her words rang truer than she could have ever known.\n\nIt was November, 2022. For a year, I’d been living in Tokyo with the love of my life — a wonderful man named Akio. It wasn’t easy for a twenty-something-year-old girl from Blackpool to adjust to life in a new country, but Akio is the kind of person who makes everything seem possible.\n\n“You thought I was anxious when I first moved to Japan, but my sister’s even more anxious than me. She’s going to be *twice* as insufferable,” I told him.\n\n“Infinity can’t be multiplied, Heidi,” Akio teased.\n\n“Whatever,” I said, rolling my eyes. “A fair warning about our brother, though — he’s an… *acquired*taste.”\n\n“I gathered that from video calls in lockdown,” He chuckled.\n\nI shook my head. “That was Sam on his best behaviour. I have a horrible feeling that you’ll see him at his worst when he comes to stay. He used to scare away my boyfriends when we were younger.”\n\n“Well, you’re not kids anymore,” Akio said, shrugging. “Besides, it can’t be any worse than the interrogation from your parents during their visit, can it?”\n\nI smiled and planted a kiss on his cheek. “I love your boundless optimism, Akio.”\n\nMy younger sister and older brother arrived at a late hour.\n\n“Absolute bastard of a flight,” Sam grumbled, storming through the front door of Akio’s high-rise flat. “Well, *two* flights…”\n\n“He only moaned about it for fifteen hours,” Millie yawned, rubbing her squeaky eyeballs with the back of her hands.\n\n“You’re here now,” I said, embracing my sister. “It means a lot that you endured Sam.”\n\nMy siblings strolled over to the floor-to-ceiling windows in the lounge. There was a mesmerising view of the capital’s futuristic skyline. The dazzling lights of Tokyo formed a starry canvas against the backdrop of a desperately-dark night. Glass-clad manmade mountains towered before us, and my oafish brother could only think to ask one thing.\n\n“Which floor is this? I thought you were living higher in the building.”\n\nI groaned, but Akio simply grinned at me and brushed off my brother’s prodding remark.\n\n“The twenty-second floor,” Akio replied. “So, I suppose you’re both probably too tired to do anything tonight?”\n\n“After travelling so far? No way! Let’s see the city,” Sam exuberantly requested.\n\nI think my sister was far too exhausted for that, but she, like me, seemed surprised to see our brother so animated. I don’t think either of us wanted to squander the opportunity to quash his surliness. She nodded her head, and Akio excitedly donned his favourite jacket.\n\n“I want to take you to my favourite shop in the city,” He said. “Mukashi.”\n\nAkio took us to the shop that I had visited with him on so many occasions. It operated out of a house belonging to an elderly lady named Mai. She was no entrepreneur. You couldn’t even find her place of business online. It was a secret store, known only to family and friends. I forget how Akio met her.\n\nMai greeted us at ten o’clock in the evening and led us into her home. *Does she ever sleep?* I wondered.\n\n“What is this place?” Sam asked.\n\n“Mukashi,” Mai answered. “It means ‘Long Ago’.”\n\n“There are all sorts of weird and wonderful things in here,” Akio said.\n\n“Things of immense power,” Mai qualified.\n\n“Who’s this creepy guy?” Sam asked.\n\nHe was pointing at a painting on the wall. A horrifying piece of art that I would skilfully swerve whenever Akio took me into Mai’s shop. It depicted a gangly, nude man with a crown on his head. From his head to his toes, he was composed of shrunken, contorted, screaming people — reminiscent of those canvases that artists build from hundreds of miniature photographs. A nightmarish version of that.\n\nAnd the crown on his head was forged of human hearts. The blood of the organised organs trickled down the man’s horrible head, drowning some of the miniature people that formed his face. Finally, the ruler of the dark and demented realm sat on a throne of bones.\n\n“Many cultures have mentioned his name in hushed whispers. The entity is known in Japanese circles as *Deikingu* — the Day King,” Mai explained.\n\n“It’s horrible… and incredible,” Millie shuddered.\n\nI nodded in agreement with my anxious sister. It was beautiful, but it was also unspeakably sickening. Neither Millie nor I were fans of the macabre. I suppose the same could be said of our brother, but, unlike us, he neither feared nor revered the artwork.\n\n“Why is it so poorly-lit?” Sam asked.\n\nHe made a valid point. Everything else in the shop basked in the warm, homely glow of Mai’s pleasant abode. But the painting lurked in the darkness. Still, I’d never complained about that. I was happy for it to be hidden. I didn’t want to know what dire details the light might reveal.\n\n“He cannot live in the dark. He draws power from the light,” Mai explained. “Anyway, I’m sorry, but it isn’t for sale. I only keep it there for… protection. Akio, I have some very exciting new antiques in stock. Would you like to take a look?”\n\nAkio enthusiastically nodded, and he followed the old lady to the other side of the room. Meanwhile, Sam eagerly eyed the painting, refusing to move along.\n\n“Come on,” Millie urged. “I can’t squeeze past you in this cramped room. Keep moving.”\n\n“I just want to get a better look at it,” Sam chuckled. “Shit, I left my phone back at the apartment. Have you got yours, Heidi?”\n\nI begrudgingly handed my phone over to him, and I could sense my sister clenching her body nervously. Everything happened so quickly. I should’ve kept the phone to myself. The flash of the camera filled up Mai’s claustrophobic room.\n\n“What was that?” The old lady screeched, running towards us.\n\n“Relax,” Sam replied. “I was just taking a photo of-”\n\nMai proceeded to brutally berate Sam in Japanese. I’ve no idea what she said, but, judging by the pale look on Akio’s face, it wasn’t pleasant in the slightest.\n\n“Who is this fool, Akio?” Mai asked in English.\n\n“I-” Akio began.\n\n“- I’m so sorry, Mai,” I interrupted, tearily. “He’s my *rude* brother.”\n\n“Have you no respect, young man?” The woman cried.\n\nAt that moment, I realised Mai wasn’t angry, as I had initially presumed. She was *frightened*.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Sam insisted. “I’m not going to leak your painting online. The picture didn’t even come out properly anyway.”\n\nMy brother showed the four of us his photograph. The camera flash had illuminated the frame. Yet, horrifically, Deikingu was nowhere to be seen. Sam was showing us a photo of a blank canvas. I looked at the actual painting and breathed a sigh of relief to see that the dreadful Day King was still sitting on his throne of bones.\n\n“You have released it,” Mai croakily cried. “May the darkness save you.”\n\n“Okay… Look, I’m sorry for upsetting you, but there’s no need to say a strange thing like that,” Sam said, scowling.\n\n“We’ll leave now, Mai,” Akio said, herding us out of the shop. “I’m so sorry.”\n\n“You have a lovely home,” Millie meekly added before we left the store.\n\nI scolded my older brother for the duration of the walk home. When we reached Akio’s apartment building, Sam pulled me to one side.\n\n“I’m sorry, Heidi,” He said. “I didn’t come all of this way to upset you. I wanted to meet Akio. I wanted to see your new life. We really miss you back home, you know.”\n\n“You have a funny way of showing it,” I huffed. “How can I ever show my face in Mai’s shop again?”\n\n“Look, I…”\n\nSam trailed off. His eyes glazed over, transfixed by something behind me. I twisted my head. There was nothing on the other side of the road but a garish neon sign above a restaurant.\n\n“Are you scared of Japanese food or something?” I joked.\n\n“No, I… I thought I saw something,” Sam said, shaking his head and returning his gaze to me. “Anyway, sorry — let’s buzz Akio to let us inside. I have to apologise to him. I’ve given him the impression that I’m a grumpy man.”\n\n“It’d be an accurate impression,” I replied, rolling my eyes.\n\nWhen we entered the flat, Sam adopted a demeanour that was much more relaxed, and that meant Millie and I could relax too — no more conducting damage control for our foot-in-mouth sibling.\n\n“I think I’m ready to hit the hay,” Millie yawned. “You guys have only had to tolerate Sam for a few hours. It’s been a whole day for me.”\n\nI chuckled. “Well, the spare bed’s made up for you, Millie. Sam, it’s the sofa for you.”\n\n“That’s what a dog deserves. I understand,” Sam teased, sparking a round of laughter that seemed to diffuse the earlier tension of the evening.\n\nAfter we had all prepared ourselves for bed, I found myself reflecting on Sam’s apology. My brother had always been a throbbing splinter beneath my skin, but he was still family.\n\n“I’m just going to clear the air with him,” I said to Akio. “I won’t be able to sleep until I do.”\n\n“Of course. Also, Heidi?” Akio started.\n\nI turned to face my smiling partner, who was tucked tightly beneath the duvet.\n\n“Yeah?” I asked.\n\n“Still not as painful as your parents’ visit,” He chortled.\n\nI threw a nearby pair of socks at him, then I strolled down the corridor to the lounge. I realised Sam was still awake, as the wall of the hallway was basking in a warm, orange glow from the living room. I rounded the corner and found my brother on the sofa, scrolling through his phone.\n\n“Hey,” I said. “I just want you to know that I’m really happy to see you. I missed you and Millie too.”\n\nSam smiled. “At least I’m not as bad as Mum and Dad, right? I’ve not begged you to come back to England yet.”\n\nI grinned. “That’s a low bar, but you’re not wrong. Night, Sam.”\n\n“Night,” My brother replied. “Wait, how do you turn off this lamp? The cord’s really fiddly.”\n\nI had been strolling out of the room, but I turned around to face Sam and answer his question.\n\nI screamed.\n\nBehind the sofa, hovering above my brother, was a tall man. I immediately realised it was the horrendous figure from the painting in Mai’s shop. He appeared far worse in the flesh. His body was composed of tiny humans who writhed and wriggled in agony — they were mutilated beyond recognition. What remained of their faces seemed to ceaselessly morph, as if the creature were built of so many victims that it could not reveal all of them at once.\n\nSam had already been pulling the cord as I started to scream, and he figured out how to turn off the lamp on his own. We sat in the darkness for a split second, but he rapidly turned the lamp back on.\n\n“What the fuck?” He asked. “Why did you scream? What’s wrong?”\n\nThe Day King had vanished. The darkness had extinguished it.\n\n“Turn the light off,” I coldly commanded.\n\nSam’s eyes widened. We shared a knowing look, and I suddenly realised what he had seen beneath the neon sign outside Akio’s apartment building. Soundlessly, and rapidly, he turned off the lamp, plunging the lounge back into a secure blanket of darkness.\n\nMillie and Akio emerged from their rooms, but I ushered them back inside and told a white lie about Sam pulling a frightening prank. Everybody went back to bed.\n\nWhen Akio woke, around seven in the morning, he was startled to see me quivering and eyeing the ceiling with bloodshot pupils. Pulling an all-nighter wasn’t exactly my choice, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d seen in the living room. It was no hallucination. I believed that. I didn’t know whether *Akio* would believe that.\n\n“Are you okay?” He asked. “You look rough.”\n\n“Love you too,” I replied. “I just couldn’t sleep.”\n\nAkio ate up the lie, but Sam cast jittery glances in my direction throughout breakfast. We had both seen the Day King. Neither of us needed to confirm that aloud — the terrible truth was etched on our fragile faces.\n\nSeemingly oblivious to my unsettled disposition, Akio jubilantly assumed the role of tour guide and encouraged us to go on a day out to his favourite park. Millie’s enthusiasm overshadowed the solemness of my brother and me. I was too distracted by my terrible thoughts to feign happiness. Every sound and movement haunted me.\n\nA wailing wind was pursuing us. It nipped and nibbled at the nape of my neck. I noticed Sam shuddering, but nobody else seemed to react to the weather. That was when I realised it wasn’t a gust of wind. It was *human* wailing.\n\nI turned to face the source of the icy noise. As soon as I did, it stopped. *Everything* stopped. The people in the park had disappeared. Only Sam and I remained.\n\n“No…” My brother cried.\n\nI finally absorbed my surroundings. It was an unusually sunny November afternoon, and shade could only be found beneath the scarce leaves of autumnal cherry trees. In the heart of the empty park, which seemed to have slipped into a splintered moment of reality, was exactly what I had feared I would see.\n\nDeikingu.\n\nThe entity with bubbling skin took purposeful strides through the grassy clearing. Its horrifying flesh glistened in the midday sun. Driven by a primal instinct to survive, I pointed to the cherry trees before I even realised I was doing so.\n\n“Mai said it can’t live in the dark,” I screeched. “Come on!”\n\nThe Day King managed to glide towards us with such sinister speed, but we reached the shade of the cherry trees in time. The horrifying entity stood at the edge of the shaded grass and watched.\n\n“Now what?” Sam asked. “How will we ever leave this place?”\n\nAs I struggled to think of an answer, Sam’s eyes suddenly rolled backwards, concealing his pupils. His head lolled to the side, as did that of the Day King. I cried in helpless horror, and the creature’s wailing sound returned. The small bodies of human victims squirmed sickeningly, as the Day King stared deeply into Sam’s soul.\n\nThen, Sam’s eyes returned to normal, and he looked back at me with a soothing smile.\n\n“We spoke,” He said. “The fault is entirely mine.”\n\nBefore I could ask what he meant, I gasped at the sight of my brother strolling towards the hellish being in the sunlight.\n\n“What are you doing?” I screamed.\n\nMy body, whether immobilised by fear or some supernatural force, was unable to reach for Sam and restrain him. I simply watched as he serenely entered the sunlight and accepted the Day King’s cold embrace.\n\nIt was an indescribably horrific spectacle which I cannot scrub from my memories. Deikingu curled his squirming arms around Sam and effortlessly enveloped his body. My brother screamed with frightening ferocity. His flesh melted and merged with the bodies of the other eternally-tortured victims that composed the Day King.\n\nSuddenly, the sun blinded me. When the glare subsided, the sound and life of the world had returned. Akio and Millie came running over to me. They found me sitting in the grass beneath the shade of the cherry tree. Onlookers were concerned by my cry for a second, but they quickly went about their days.\n\n“What’s wrong, Heidi?” Akio asked. “We lost you for a second. How did you get all of the way over here so quickly?”\n\n“Where’s Sam?” I breathlessly blubbered.\n\nMillie looked around, frowning. Neither she nor Akio had an answer for my question. Sam was never found, and how could I tell anyone that the Day King had added him to its barbarous collection?\n\nAnd that was confirmed when Mai allowed us back into her shop. Akio still doesn’t know what I saw. I don’t want him to think I’m crazy. But Mai knew. I could see it in her eyes. She saw me looking at the painting.\n\nShe saw me shudder at the sight of Sam’s tattooed, limbless torso, which formed the left tip of Deikingu’s sinister smile.\n\nI think the lady had dimmed the lights since the last time we’d been in her store.\n\nAfter all, the darkest things live in the light.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",
