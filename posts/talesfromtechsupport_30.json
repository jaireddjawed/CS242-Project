This is a short one, but I hope, first of many.\n\nI do software support for AEC industry (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) people at a rather large international firm.\n\n95% of my co-workers are incredible people, really the most intelligent and hard working group of employees that I have ever worked with. They have the attitude of \"I'll figure it out and get it done, no matter what.\" Which means when they come to me with a question, it will be something extremely difficult, and something I've usually never seen before.\n\nBut then there's the other 5%. Which leads me to this short tale.\n\nA ticket comes in from $user stating she had an error message and cannot use a piece of software. No other information.\n\nI call $user on her Skype address immediataly, hoping she hasn't exited the error dialog box. Thankfully she hadn't, and she read it out to me:\n\n$user: \"The software you are opening requires a license. All available licenses are currently in use. Please ask a co-worker to exit the program or buy more licenses.\"\n\n$user: \"What should I do?\"\n\n$me: (after lowering my eyebrows back down to their normal height) \"Well, I imagine you should either ask a co-worker not using the program to exit and try again, or ask your director to buy more licenses for your department.\"\n\nEnd.",

        "text": "I got to branch out a little bit. I used to do service calls for a company and occasionally help them off to the side in my free time because they are just good people and they appreciate me. I walk in one day and they have a box on the front desk.\n\nTech: Hey so we got the website up and running whats up with the brown box over there? You guys got some cool upgrades?\n\nFront Desk1: No we had a phone issue with rooms ### and ###, the guy came out said we need to order this and is coming back next week to fix them. I swear those rooms haven't worked for months.  But everything is great!\n\nRepair guy: Yea Mr. X told us to order this 66 block and new amphenol cable. He said the system needs to be re-wired. It seems like a lot, you used to do this, what do you think?\n\nNow mind you a 66 block in my career and my seniors have never gone bad unless struck by lightning or someone just straight up abusing it. So i talk it over with them and head over that weekend. I get both rooms fixed and find that the guy has no idea what he is doing, wires are in the wrong places, nothing tested properly, and even punched wires to dead blocks that haven't been in use since i left the company(1-2 years). Mind you all of this took maybe an hour and some common sense.\n\nTech: Alright everything is all fixed up. Are there any other rooms or things you have an issue with?\n\nFront Desk: Nope all good to go, what did you do to get it done so quickly, Mr. X sits for hours and sometimes doesn't even get it done!\n\nRepair Guy: Do you know Mr. X's address i'm going to take this crap and mail it to him.\n\nI'll save some blather, but essentially Mr. X is not a very nice guy and has a bad rap at the place. They also made sure to report to his manager about the incident and won't be calling them back. It amazes me how some people try to make it up as they go. This time the customer was actually great but the tech....Well yea, more business for honest people.",

        "text": "One idle and fairly quiet Friday in late February at $BigBossCompany, I get back to my desk after lunch, ready to start surfing Reddit and trying to make it to the end of the day without strangling a co-worker or screaming senseless profanities at a customer (yes, my life as an $MSPManager had devolved to the simple things in life: violence and degradation). \n\nI open Outlook to take a look at an odd email that came in during lunch from $CluelessNonProfit’s control freak of an $ExecutiveDirector. I had glanced at it on my phone, saw that it was from $ExecutiveDirector and that it didn’t look like an urgent “system down!” issue so it could wait until I enjoyed my Subway.\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"TheITCustodian, see the attached email from $Vendor of a new piece of equipment we're buying for our fleet of vehicles. They'll be here next Monday to install it.\"\n\nI scan the email, reading down to the $Vendor’s specs. The more I read, the more confused I get. I bring up $Vendor’s website. This is pretty extensive. Its not “a” piece of equipment, its more like several dozen pieces of hardware, wireless equipment and such. And $SystemSoftware. That runs on a separate server and potentially stores hundreds of gigabytes of data.\n\nOn a whim, I call the $Vendor, 4 timezones away, and ask for the $TechSpecialist who sent the email. After a short chat with him, tech guy to tech guy, all spec, facts and operational concepts understood, I call $CluelessNonProfit.ExecutiveDirector and play a little dumb.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Hi, $ED. I got your email about the equipment you’re having installed. Is this a $System for your entire fleet of vehicles?”\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: “Yes, every piece of equipment will have this $System installed on it. I want you to install the $SystemSoftware on my PC.” (here’s where the control freak starts to peek out a little)\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Uh, yeah, the $SystemSoftware won’t run on your PC. From the specs and the information supplied by $Vendor, $SystemSoftware is designed to run on a server class machine.”\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"I didn’t know that. I want it to run on our current server, then.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Your current server won't run this software, either. 2TB of space minimum required. Your whole server doesn’t even have 2TB on it. You'd be out of disk space before you know it. $System is designed around a dedicated server to manage the recorded data and the equipment. $SystemSoftware really has to be installed on a dedicated server, not your domain controller.\"\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"But, the $Vendor is going to be here next Monday to install this system. They’re flying a tech in from [four timezones away].\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Wait, Monday as in three days from now? Not a week from Monday? How long has this been in the works?\"\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"Since the middle of January.\"\n\nUnbeknownst to $ExecutiveDirector, $TechSpecialist at $Vendor mentioned to me on the phone that they’d been out to do a site survey back around Thanksgiving as part of their quote, and $Vendor got the green light to proceed well before Christmas. They’d even sent techs from their $LocalPartner to install the hardware on all the vehicles in the previous month. $ExecutiveDirector was totally lying to me on that. \n\nBut I knew that the installer, who was flying on Monday, wasn’t going to start his actual work until Tuesday and even then, he had a bunch of prep work to do, wiring and mounting the exterior wireless access points that communicate with the vehicles, etc, before he would even be to the point where the server was needed. We had a *tiny* bit more breathing room than $ExecutiveDirector was letting on. I wasn’t going to burn the $Vendor, but I wasn’t letting $ExecutiveDirector off the hook, either.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So you *just now* thought to involve the IT people on the Friday before a major implementation, one that requires a server and possibly network changes, that you knew was coming for *months*?\"\n\nI sensed slight change in $ExecutiveDirector’s tone.  Almost a pleading.\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"Look, the board is all over me on this project, we have to get it working on time. How soon can you have a server? $Vendor’s tech is flying in on Monday to start the install, I can’t have him standing around…\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"We’re IT guys, not miracle workers. You didn’t even HINT at this whole thing until about an hour ago. I don’t have servers sitting on the shelf, ready to bail out customers who don’t involve their IT people in major IT projects until 72 hrs beforehand, you know. It could take up to a week. And then, I already have techs scheduled to work on projects next week with customers who *actually* plan ahead and communicate with their IT consultants, so I’d have to figure out who I can bust loose to work on *your emergency*, never mind a legit emergency that might occur at another customer site.  It might not even be until Thursday or Friday I could get someone over there, depending on whether or not I can even get a server in time…”\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: “A week! Oh my god…”\n\n&gt;$Me: “I tell you what, I've gotta bust my ass to get you a Statement of Work and a quote for the server and our installation work. I'll get something over to you in the next couple hours for your approval. But I’m going to tell you up front: its not going to be a custom box, it will be the first available off-the-shelf server that meets the minimum $SystemSoftware spec that I can get fast-tracked for delivery at some point next week. That’s even *if* I can get one. And the shipping is not going to be cheap. And all of this is of course a project, meaning its time &amp; materials and not covered under your break-fix contract.”\n\nWhile we'd been on the phone, I had 2-3 potential severs picked out in my supplier’s inventory system and I was building a quote in our work order system. 5 minutes after I’d hung up from $ExecutiveDirector, I was in $BigBoss’s office to get the quote approved. I explained the whole thing to him. \n\nOften, $BigBoss was an asshole about stuff like this, so I never knew if I was going to get a ream job along with my request to approve a quote. $BigBoss must have been in a good mood, but even his brow furrowed when I explained $ExecutiveDirector’s lack of planning and how we were going to have to bail them out. $BigBoss liked it when we could bail a customer out, because that made us look more valuable when it came time to pay the bill.\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “Fsck her, tack another $500 on this under miscellaneous, call it “Expedite Fee” or something, just for her lack of planning, and send it. I’ll give you half of that for putting up with her shit and very obviously going the extra mile to fix their fsck up, and we’ll give the other half to whichever tech you send to install, just as incentive to deal with their crap.”\n\n&gt;$Me: “OK, chief. Basically, do what we need to do to make it work, but make sure its somewhat painful so they think twice the next time?\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Exactly.”\n\n$ExecutiveDirector approved the Statement of Work &amp; server quote, with the shipping and the expedite fee. I ordered the box and had it setup for a Monday delivery (gotta love good relations with your suppliers and Next Day Air) at our office so we could do a quick config on it before bringing it to $CluelessNonProfit’s offices. After an hour and a half of crazy, things were looking up.\n\nI called $Vendor again and spoke to the $InstallTech who was flying out, just to make sure neither of us was going to get blindsided by some requirement that $CluelessNonProfit would have neglected to mention. I wanted to be sure we were clear on what $Vendor and $InstallTech expected and wanted from a network standpoint to get their data onto the $CustomerLAN and back to the server. Last thing I wanted was to have to pull an audible to setup a last minute VLAN on Wednesday afternoon, or have him hear “Oh, hahaha, we didn’t think it would matter that our walls are three feet thick. What do you mean you can’t drill thru 3 ft of masonry and concrete?” \n\nStrangely enough, the whole thing the next week went essentially like clockwork: The wireless access points were installed and connected with no drama and no interference with the $CluelessNonProfit’s wifi, even. Server showed up on time, was configured at our office, installed on site Tuesday, joined to their domain, setup for backup and handed off to the $InstallTech on Wednesday. We installed the client software on the machines that needed it (the control-freak $ExecutiveDirector, notably) and helped facilitate a little user training (more billable time, baby) and $System testing. \n\nAt the end of the day on Thursday, during full-up $System testing, a fly appeared in the proverbial ointment.\n\nThis $System is installed on $CluelessNonProfit’s vehicles. They spent big money on equipping every single piece of equipment that they have with these recording boxes along with a vehicle-mounted wireless antenna that talks to the server. Basically, a vehicle comes *within range* of the wireless access points outside the building, and it connects and downloads the vehicle's data to the server. Pretty straightforward and easy. Since it is regular 802.11 wireless, the vehicles have to essentially be in the parking lot to communicate with this $System. That has been a pretty constant piece of information in *all* of the literature I read from $Vendor, and in how they describe the function of the $System. \n\nIn the midst of some emails flying back and forth, it is uncovered that some of $CluelessNonProfit’s $System-equipped vehicles don't *ever* come to the facility on a daily basis. But yet, $ExecutiveDirector has some nebulous expectation that these vehicles will somehow *magically* communicate with the $System and download their data, even dozens of miles from their building. \n\nMind you these people have been working with this $Vendor since before December, identified all the vehicles that this hardware would be installed on, they had the $LocalPartner installers come out and install the $System equipment and wireless antennas in the vehicles. \n\nAnd never once did $CluelessNonProfit even mentioned to the $Vendor that four of their vehicles are in a completely separated operating location 30 miles away from the main building, three or four of them at any one time are at a maintenance garage elsewhere, and at least five of their vehicles go home with the drivers at night. In other words, at least twelve or thirteen pieces of their equipment don't come to the main building. Ever. Unless they need to be dispatched to maintenance and sometimes not even then.\n\nSuddenly they are all unhappy with $Vendor that their pieces of equipment that are far afield will not communicate with the $System at the main office. And of course, it's not the $Vendor's issue. It is *very clear* in the product literature that the vehicle has to be within range of the outdoor wifi at the office to download the data from the vehicle. And, $CluelessNonProfit let the vendor install the hardware in every piece of vehicle they have, knowing they have vehicles that never ever come to the main building, and they never said a word until now. The day before the guy gets on the plane to fly home.\n\nIt's definitely not me, it's them.",

(Because, you guessed it... an robot tried to kill me).\n\n\nSo who we have:\n\n$me: an young plc-programmer right after the coal plant\n\n$cw: my coworker\n\n$cus: customer\n\n$rob: the robot programmer \n\nLocation:\n\nan plant for car rims in another country.\n\nThe tale:\n\n$cw and $me had the job to programm something new for an plant that produces car rims. It was an easy job, but had to be on an weekend because... you know... production :)\n\nIt all went well, and we where faster than we thought ... and everything was nice and easy. We chilled a bit and watched the machine where we worked at. We where very happy, and planed leaving early. Sometimes in the afternoon I went somewhere in the plant, and saw an robot grabbing rims, and putting them somewhere else. I looked a few seconds, an went on my way.\n\n\nOn the way back I felt something, and I had the urge to stop. I stopped for a second, but thought to myself that this was nothing and went on. Right wenn I took my step I heard an loud bang. An 24\" rim hit the floor, not 1/2 banana infront of my foot. If I had just moved on and didnt stop, the rim would have hit me. It left an little crate in the concrete where it hit, and I turned around to check my pants if it left there something as well. \n\nAfter that I asked $rob what happened. He sayed that the robot lost the grip and let the rim go... its not the first time this happened. They installed an safety-net after that. But what I heard was that the robot throw another rim and it bounced back in the net and destroyed the gripper of the robot.\n\nTL/DR: Robot tried to throw a rim at me, my jedi-skills saved me.",

They show up 3 minutes late and expect everything to just work, of course!\n\nSo, meeting is already underway, about 10 people in it. Projector wont connect.

        "text": "First and foremost. No I will not be providing pics. \n\nSo around 2 PM today we all noticed something very strange. No more remote sessions, nor emails were coming into the system at all. Lync/Skype showed nothing wrong until just about everyone got logged out at the same time. The calls suddenly started jumping off left and right. Everyone is complaining about their email. Suddenly the most vital of emails to ever exist in the history of the world plus infinity are not going through. The normal methods are not working... AND NOW OUTLOOK LOGGED ME OUT FIX IT NAOOO!!!!!!!!!\n\nAhem. You get the picture. The fire alarm went off to raucous laughter throughout IT. OF COURSE the fire alarm is going off now. \n\nOur manager comes out and tells us all to exit out and for me to join him in the server room. One of the racks has smoke coming out the back of it. We pull the rack and see a full blown fire, no sparks, but a fire inside the primary exchange box. We pull it and then exit the room as fire dept comes in. The argon suppressors were going off, unbeknownst to us, so when we get outside me and my manager sound like our voices dropped 12 octaves. We had fun with that making a few firemen laugh. They didnt want to chance it so they called an emt in just to check us out. Argon is pretty safe but its better to be safe than sorry. \n\nFire bros pull out the giant fans to blow the smoke out and then let us all back inside. I get inside and hear the ugly news. \n\n&gt; $Server bro - The entire box is going to have to be replaced. \n\n&gt; $me - So what does that mean?\n\n&gt; $Server bro - No email for the entire company for 24-48 hours. \n\nMy eyes lit up and I walked back to my desk. I load up the phone system site and re-record the voicemail. \n\n&gt; $me - Thank you for calling *our company* support line. Unfortunately none of our agents can assist at the moment as a fire has destroyed the email server. All of your emails are safe and sound, however no incoming or outgoing email will go through for the next 24 - 48 hours. Thank you for your patience. \n\nI then told EVERY SINGLE TECH. To log out of the phone system. We all went into the breakroom and hooked up netflix through a laptop to the tv. They started watching marvel tv shows on netflix. \n\nThe EVP over IT came and asked what we were doing, saying his phone was getting blown up. We informed him of the issue and told him our fix will not be in place until the emergency shipping arrived tonight. (UPS Same day shipping is not cheap, but it is fast.) \n\n&gt; $EVPIT - So what do I tell the other VP,s Presidents, and Chielfs till then?\n\n&gt; $ME - Tell them there is nothing that can be done till UPS gets here so turn their phones off. \n\nHE turned his phone off and sat down to watch netflix with us. \n\n&gt; $EVPIT - I am going to order pizza. \n\n\nSo what caused this fire you might ask? Well when I joined my boss in the server room, there still on the floor was the incriminating evidence. All wrapped up in the subway wrapper uneaten, save for a single bite out of it, was a footlong subway meatball sub. In the back of the server box that caught fire? Marinara sauce and a half eaten meatball. \n\nToday we are down 1 server bro and up one \"No food or drink beyond this point\" sign. ",

What he didnt had in mind was the fact that the system cuts the power to the servers to reduce sources of fire. So he room went silent while all went off... IT came, got everything up and running, and everythin was fine.\n  \nFast forward 2hrs. The same spiel. $worker comes in, hits the button, alarm goes off. We leave the room, better safe than sorry. $bm panics, because he deactivated the system. He did it again, IT came again, now pissed, here we go. \n  \nFast forward another hour. Again, the same spiel. button, alarm, bm, IT. $worker is in panic, he says f*** it, I am out... this is nothing for me anymore. $bm panics again, and I ask him if the disabling of the system is only for the automatic deploy via fire or smoke sensors... He looked at me and sayed \"yep, maybe you are right\".\n\n2 Days later I got an mail:\n  \n\"Install emergency-buttons with covers that you have to lift before you can push the button in all serverrooms.\n  \ngreetings\n  \n$BM\"\n\n  \n$me did as he was told, but $worker was nowhere to be seen.\n",

This involved holding a couple of buttons for 4 seconds with a corresponding indicator light flashing once per second. 4 seconds = 4 flashes. He refuses to follow these steps, insisting that he was due to go into a meeting within 20 minutes time. Eventually he came around to the idea that this wouldn't take very long and that he could not actually print anything currently anyway, so what did he have to lose? I repeat that he needs to hold the buttons and release them only after the indicator light has flashed 4 times. He proceeds to hold the buttons and with an exasperated sigh he says \"Now pay attention and you let me know when to let go\"...",

Seriously.\n\nAs I related in a [comment on one of my previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/85d5np/promises_promises/dvxt0ty/?st=jeylruhe&amp;sh=2f2fbb50), after the user base started to see some new computers appearing on desks, people were getting bent that they weren't the recipients of the $DangNerdGriefCompany's largess when it came to hardware. Even people who already had fairly new gear.\n\n$LUser comes in my office one morning with his laptop. This laptop is only about 13 or 14 months old and is really one of the \"newer\" computers at $DangNerdGriefCompany.\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"It won't start.\"\n\nHuh, OK.  I start to troubleshoot it.  Plug it, try to start it, nothing. The power button is flashing. This is odd. (I've been primarily in Dell &amp; HP shops for the last 10+ years so I'm still re-learning the intricacies of Lenovo's beep codes and such, so a flashing power button isn't an \"obviously it means this\" sign yet.)\n\nPull the power, flip it over, yank the battery, wait 15 seconds, re-seat it, flip it back over, hit the power button, nothing. Plug it back in, hit the button. Nothing.\n\nThen $LUser drops the bomb.\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, [co-worker] *might* have spilled coffee 'near' it.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Wait. Define 'near' it?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, it might have gotten splashed with a *little* coffee, but we picked up the laptop immediately and mopped up the desk and I'm *sure* none went in it.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (knowing where this is going way, way before it goes there) \"Uh huh. OK. Sure. Splashed...right...\"\n\nNow knowing this unit possibly suffered a liquid intrusion, something the $LUser should have mentioned *before* I flipped the computer over, I immediately remove the power cord and battery, remove the memory door cover, pop out the RAM and the hard disk, and start to unscrew the keyboard from the back side. I'm pretty sure I know what I'm going to find here. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Oh, lookie.. there's coffee all up under the keyboard.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"There's *no way* that coffee got there. It only spilled *in front* of the computer on the desk.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"See this brown stuff here? Yes, thats coffee. See how it soaks into this swab and its brown? See this flat ribbon cable here? See how the coffee is up under the keyboard and between the ribbon cable and the keyboard? This isn't a *splash*.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"No, no, no.. I'm telling you, coffee didn't get on the laptop, just on the desk in front of it.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Uh huh.  See these little vents on the front of the computer? They're not very big. And this particular model of laptop has the keyboard with the liquid tray under it, so any liquid that winds up *on* the keyboard is just supposed to go right out these two holes in the bottom of the system and not hit motherboard or anything. The only way liquid got in right here is if it faced a tsunami of coffee on that desk. \" \n\n&lt;continues removing components. Removes optical drive from the bay&gt; \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Oh, huh. If this computer didn't get any coffee in it, then can you explain why the BOTTOM OF THE DVD DRIVE IS SOAKED WITH BROWN LIQUID?\" (I hold up the DVD drive, facing the $LUser)\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I'm telling you, no coffee got on this computer!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: &lt;Pointing inside the bottom of the case where PUDDLES of coffee are collected in the corners of the case stiffener ridges under the DVD drive&gt; \"So, that's what? Piss water? Sludge? The toilet backed up while your PC was on the bathroom floor? Cuz that sure looks like coffee to me. You want to tell me what really happened in your office?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Wha.. what?\"\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xUiyN\n\n&gt;$Me: [as U.S. Marshal Sam Girard] \"You wanna revise your bullshit story, sir?\"\n\nThe post-script to this story is that the $LUser's office area is considered part of the manufacturing area. An area that our employee manual *very specifically* states is a \"no food or drink\" area. \n\n$OpsVP, $LUser's boss, gets a PO request for new hardware for $LUSer. Noted on the PO \"Replacement for liquid damaged laptop.\" $OpsVP loses his mind.  \"And this is your lead ISO 9001 trainer..\"  $LUser gets a written reprimand for violating company policy in a way that resulted in a loss of $DangNerdGriefCompany assets.  And I'm pretty sure he did it intentionally to get a *newer* laptop.\n\n$LUser lost his job about 6 months later for *yet another* liquid spill in his office.  Can't say I'm sorry he's gone.",

Think of Malcolm McDowell always in a nasty mood.\n\n&gt;$MI: Male intern\n\n&gt;$FI: Female intern\n\nA couple of months ago we got a call from an office reporting email and calendar sync issues.\n\nI enter the office and can only see the $FI there. Her second day on the job, she does not know any of the passwords on the email accounts (a dozen accounts) and needs help in resetting them. All the accounts still work on the $BSB's PC. But $FI needs to add some email accounts on her phone and cannot figure out how to reset the passwords. They also need a couple of accounts removed in Outlook from the $BSB's PC (they no longer use those accounts).\n\nFirst things first, I remove the accounts $FI tells me they no longer use. Then I take a look at the accounts she wants the passwords reset. All the accounts are from their custom domain, they have a mail server from their hosting provider. I tell $FI I will need the server details to reset the passwords. $FI tells me only the $BSB knows this stuff and will be here soon. Meanwhile I share and add the google calendar they wanted on all their tablets, phones and PC's.\n\nWhile we wait for $BSB, $MI drops by (fresh graduate). Apparently $MI and the $BSB arrived to the office together. $BSB is downstairs getting coffee and will be there soon. $MI tells me this is his second day as well. It is an unpaid internship that he plans to do for a couple of months. Tells me it will be good for him because $BSB is a Big Shot in their profession.\n\n$BSB comes in and I ask him details of their hosting provider. He tells me I have to speak with their IT guy. Puzzled I ask why they needed us if they have an IT guy. Tells me the IT guy lives in another city so he can't do this stuff (have they never heard of teamviewer?). He gives me the phone number of their IT guy.\n\nI call their IT guy and am taking down details of their hosting provider but because $BSB is being loud and screaming at $FI &amp; $MI I can't hear what he is saying. I step out of the office and close the door.\n\nSuddenly $BSB steps out and shrugs (more like makes the gesture asking 'what are you doing'). I shrug back. He opens the door signs that I need to go in. I go in and he keeps glaring at me. I am on the phone so I keep ignoring him. Suddenly he grabs my hand holding the phone and pulls it away from my ears. I am confused at what he wants\n\n\n&gt;$BSB: Don't you think that is rude?\n\n&gt;$Me: huh?\n\n&gt;$BSB: Talking with my employee about me and my company in a private conversation?\n\n&gt;$Me: What?\n\n&gt;$BSB: Put it on the speakerphone so we all can listen\n\nStunned I complied and put it on the speakerphone. His IT guy tells me he will just mail the $BSB the details (he must have repeated himself several times already). The mail arrives. I reset their passwords and leave.\n\nGo home and am uneasy the whole time. Keep thinking that was f#$%ing rude. Yanking my hand and ordering me to turn the speakerphone on.\n\nAt work the next day and boss tells me they called as I hadn't solved all their problems. Go back and $FI &amp; $MI are panicking, no sign of $BSB. After I removed the unused accounts from outlook his whole address book was wiped. Okay, so the address book was saved on one of the unused accounts then. Ask if they have the address book on any of the other PC's. They have it on an Ipad. I am exporting all the contacts when suddenly\n\n&gt;$MI: I apologize on his behalf. \n\n&gt;Me: For what?\n\n&gt;$MI: He's gonna be here any moment and he is super pissed.\n\n&gt;$Me: So?\n\n&gt;$MI: He may scream and call you names, but he's a good guy.\n\n&gt;$Me: Not today mate, you may be his intern I am not. I am in no mood today.\n\n$BSB enters the office and we have a glorious shouting match. He blames me for removing his address book and I tell him that was what was requested off me, to remove the unused accounts. Then he switches to shouting at $FI and $MI because it must have been their fault for asking me to remove the unused accounts. \n\n$MI takes the screaming sheepishly for a while then suddenly goes\n\n$MI: This is not worth it. This is not gonna work out. I quit\n\n$MI walks out leaving everyone in shock. $BSB asks if I will still fix his address book. I say yes. Had already exported them to a single file, only needed importing. Imported the address book and left. \n\n",

        "text": "I used to service the alarms at a sheltered housing complex. The building was two storey, with long corridors and rooms along them. Not unlike a hotel.\nThe warden would do a test every Friday, this involved setting it off, silencing it, walking round to check all the fire doors had closed, then resetting.  \n\nFor those not in the know, there are two kings of output, control and alarm. Alarm outputs will deactivate when the 'silence' button is pressed, but control outputs stay active until the reset is done. Bells are on alarms, doors are on controls.  \n\nSo, whilst silenced the doors wouldn't hold open and the warden was able to check them all without the bells going off for too long.  \n\nA new panel had been installed, this one required a code to be entered to access the silence and reset functions, previous one used a key switch.  \n\nA call came in on Friday, saying she couldn't reset it after the test. I was in the area, and it was one of my sites so I took it. Went there and it was silenced but still 'in fire'. I entered the code and reset it, no problem.  \nShe was puzzled, and took out the explicit instructions the installers had left.  \n\n* activate call point\n* enter code\n* press silence\n* press reset\n\nSeems straightforward enough. What they didn't take into account is that there's a timeout after the code entry, about five minutes.  It took longer than that to do the walkaround so by the time she got back to the panel the reset didn't work.  \n\nAn extra line was added to the list: If the 'access' light is off, enter the code again before resetting.  \n\nI like the easy ones.",

The lady was basically right clicking on a file on her PC and clicking copy, *unplugging the mouse and plugging it into someone else’s PC*, then clicking paste.\n\nIn a way, I can’t blame her massively, but we all found it hilarious. Also, trying to explain this to someone who isn’t tech savvy over the phone is really tough. ",

I don't know JS (~~Joe Satriani?~~) myself, but I asked what the issue was. Some other passenger got a JavaScript-error on her $mePhone while trying to connect to the train's wifi. This train's wifi is an open network that lets you connect and then summons a page that urges you to accept their T&amp;C. After accepting them, you have ye regular olde WiFi. (the train provides WiFi-hotspots on board, which connect through 4G to the cellular network. Yes, we're spoiled in the Netherlands)\nThe trouble was: this lady did not get the 'T&amp;C acceptance'-page so she wasn't allowed on the interwebz.

There is a lot of backstory to explain why it is I was in the position I am about to get into, but the TL:DR is that when our clients have issues connecting to the internet, they can bring the device to the front desk for us to take a look at. It's usually pretty simple stuff; our network is very weird about how you connect to it. Anyhow, I am rather proficient in the tech support department, and I often get asked if I can figure out why something or another wasn't working. I am happy to take a look at it, and often get great review comments later on about being \"A magician\". The guests generally are much older, so they always talk sweet. Well, yesterday I had the pleasure of witnessing a rather.... interesting arrangement.  \nA guest comes to the front desk, and asks if I can help her with a weird internet glitch or whatnot with her android tablet. I say that I certainly could take a look at it, and asked what the glitch seemed to be. I then watch her whip the flap of her cover off her tablet and I see that the screen has INSANE scratches on it. She then pulls out a mechanical pencil and swipes it across the screen. This pencil is a drafting-style one, but without the lead extended, and RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME adds two new scratches to her screen. She then mutters  \n\n &gt;\"I don't know why I try to use this damn thing [gesturing to the pencil], my son showed me but I cannot get it to work...\"  \n\nWHAT??? My jaw must have actually dropped because she then got a strange look and asked if I had an issue or something. I then explained that the pencil she was using was not one that could activate the screen, and that her son probably used a stylus.  \n\n&gt;\"ohhhhh that would explain a lot...\"\n&gt;\"Ma'am, if you don't mind me asking, how long have you been trying to make that pencil work?\"  \n&gt;\"Only about a week or two...\"  \n&gt;\"I would hate to inform you, but those scratches are permanent there on your screen...\"  \n&gt;\"What?! Scratches??\"  \n\nShe then took a look at her screen closely, and I pointed out the scratches that she could FEEL with your nail. She then, with all seriousness, said   \n\n&gt;\"I thought those were track lines or something for the pen\".  \n\nI nearly fainted, to tell you all the truth. I thought that she was pranking me. I thought I was about to be on television.  \n\nOh and the best part? The internet glitch she was having was, and I quote  \n\n&gt;\"...there were all these stupid lines on top of the articles I am trying to read. But I guess we figured that out.\"  \n\nI have been enjoying the gossip throughout the office, so at least I have a great story to share. ",

I am part of a small support team managing over a thousand users, many of whom have the letters M.D., P.A., D.O. as a part of their names. \n\nIn addition to performing internal company support in a Citrix based environment(everything from AD account creation, account unlocks, password resets, supporting company cell phones and IP phone systems, servicing printers, email management, setting up projectors for presentations, supporting workflows/resetting user accounts in an EMR application and many other systems). In short, we support...everything.\n\nIn our *overabundance* of free time we're also responsible for taking calls from patients who are having difficulty accessing a patient portal website containing test results and various other tools for patient care. This last part winds up being most time-consuming aspect of our job, despite the other responsibilities providing more than enough work to justify our hilariously poor pay.\n\nAs a result, we're overworked, underpaid, hated by management(a common theme among IT workers), and literally kept in a dungeon with our servers and network equipment(ok, it's a basement, forgive the hyperbole). And we frequently take calls from patients with various medical conditions that are far too eager to share the most intimate details we'd rather not know. \n\nEvery now and then we get the patient that may very well be suffering from dementia(calling so much that we're on a first name basis with the patient and we can recognize them by their voice). Successfully talking an 85 year old who's never used a computer through using their very first iPad to log on to this website is an act worthy of recognition-falling just short of the word \"miracle\"- and we do it multiple times daily. \n\nWe also take calls from people who evidently feel that the misery their medical conditions create for them entitles them to be hostile towards others(like those people forced to try and help them) and will try to make them miserable too. As the saying goes; misery loves company.\n\nManagement is well aware that the calls can get particularly rough, there are enough profanity-laced tirades tossed around between calls to make even the most experienced sailor blush. It can be extremely stressful so we're given a lot of leeway as long as we remain somewhat professional with the callers. That can be trying at times. This is one of those tales.\n\n$me &lt;--Me\n$olfh &lt;--Old Lady From Hell\n\n$me: \"Thank you for calling Company Name's/*Companies Product* Service Desk my name is $me, how can I help you today\"\n\n$olfh: \"I can't access my *companies product*\n\n$me: \"I can help with that\n\nAt this point I gather her information and have her confirm her information for HIPAA compliance purposes. \n\n$me: \"It appears you were locked out of your account due to unsuccessful password entry attempts, I have reactivated your account- would you like me to reset your password to a temporary one so you can change it or do you know it\"\n\n$olfh: \"I'm not an idiot, I know how computers work, I know my password\"\n\n$me: \"I didn't think you were an idiot ma'am, can you just go ahead and log in, I just want to verify you're able to get in to your account before we disconnect this call\"\n\n$olfh: \"It says Login Unsuccessful\"\n\nYou all know what this means, she doesn't know her password.\n\n$me: \"Ok ma'am, I've just reset your password to (a very easy password that Spaceballs would approve of), when you sign in with that as the password you'll immediately be prompted to select a new password. That password just needs to be (outlines password requirements which are VERY lenient). \n\n$olfh: I don't want to change my password\n\n$me: \"Does your existing password meet the security requirements I've just explained to you? If it does you can just re-enter it and use it.\"\n\n$olfh: \"No\"\n\n$me: \"I'm sorry ma'am, you'll need to choose a new password then that meets those requirements\"\n\n$olfh: \"But I don't want to change my password, you should have told me I'd have to change my password\" \n\n$me: \"Ma'am, users whose passwords do not meet the new password security requirements would have been required to change their password on their next login\" these changes were implemented about a month and a half ago. \n\n$olfh: \"Well, I don't want to change my password\"\n\nI can see where this is going, and no...she's not getting what she wants.\n\n$me: \"Ma'am, if you don't choose a password that meets the new security requirements you won't be able to access your *company service we provide to patients for free*.\"\n\n$olfh: \"Let me speak with your supervisor\"\n\n$me: \"No Ma'am, my supervisor would have to tell you the same thing I am explaining to you. You are not required to use the *company service we provide for free* but if you do choose to use it, you must do so under the terms that we outlined, among those terms is that you use a password that we deem as secure, which your password currently is not. If you do not wish to use a secure password, you can not use the *company service*\"\n\n$olfh: \"I'm the customer, I'm always right you little %^&amp;%\" \n\nAnd at that, my inner BOFH awakened. Yes...she just swore at me.\n\n$me: \"Ma'am, you're not going to get what you want, in fact due to your personal attack on me, you've just lost your right to use this service. I am now deactivating your account permanently and disconnecting this call. Have a good day!\" &gt;clickety&lt; &gt;click&lt;\n\nAnd with that I deactivated her account, marked her as forbidden from accessing the service(and the reason why), and disconnected the call.\n\nThat was the highlight of my day.\n\nA BOFH was born.",

It took special paper, special ink and had binding and sorting devices bolted onto the side. \n\nIn case of issues we were always the first port of call.

It was definitely having problems; the status page was throwing up some strange errors and the custom software log was vomiting out hundreds of weird entries. From what I could decipher it was some sort of hardware error. Not good. \n\nAs they were just down the road, I called $Printing_Company_Lady and let her know I would pop onsite to take a look. I was expecting a long afternoon on the phone to the manufacturer with printer ink ruining my sweet nylon shirt.  \n\nI arrive and head to her desk.

I only just now have calmed down about it…  \n\n**Some info:**  \n\nProblem: User could not log in to a 3rd party site, with his login.  \n$Me = Me  \n$User = User with problem  \n$AppOwner = In house 3rd party application owner \n\n*Ticket comes in with title: “Unable to log into $ReputableShippingSite with login xxxxxx”*\n&gt;**$Me:** Hello $User, can I remote into your computer and take a look at your problem?  \n**$User:** Sure.\n\n*Remote in and proceed to troubleshoot*  \n*Site comes up asking for a customer number and successful login*  \n\n&gt;**$Me:** So the problem appears to be that you need a customer number. Do you know who is the one in charge of this account?  \n**$User:** Yes it’s $AppOwner.  \n**$Me:** Okay. Can you get in contact with him and enter in the account number? *(Normally I would do this part but, it is sensitive information, so I'd rather get the account owner to enter it in.)*  \n**$User:** Sure. I’ll get back to you later.\n\n*Later that day…*\n&gt;**$User:** Hey, so $AppOwner said that you should be able to fix it.  \n**$Me:** Yes. Did you get the account number?  \n**$User:** No, $AppOwner says that I shouldn’t need it.  \n**$Me:** I’m sorry, $User, but the site says you need an account number to access the shipping information.  \n**$User:** Okay, let me try again.\n\n*15 minutes later, I get a call from $AppOwner on my cellphone*\n&gt;**$AppOwner:** Hi, IT? Can you come down, right away to take a look at $User’s problem?  \n**$Me:** $AppOwner, I have already looked at it, and we will need the account number to get that account up and running.  \n**$AppOwner:** No you don’t. That account sign in works on Computer2, but not on Computer1, so the account number isn’t the problem. The computer settings is the problem! Can you come check the settings?  \n**$Me:** $AppOwner, the computer settings are not the issue. As this is a 3rd party site, we have already checked Compatibility and Trust Settings. The page loads and no errors occur, I can tell you that the settings are fine, so I’d like to get the account number as the login used is asking for an account number.  \n**$AppOwner:** You’re wrong, he does not need an account number. Are you going to help?  \n**$Me:** I can’t help if you are not going to provide me with the account number. If you are unwilling then I cannot do anything. \n\n*Phone vibrates and shows 1% battery life remaining*\n\n&gt;**$Me:** Sorry, my phone is about to run out of batteries, so we may be cut off, if you do not provide me with the information.  \n**$AppOwner:** Are you going to come and help or not? I know what the issue is and we need you to fix it. *with the tone of I'm right you're wrong*  \n**$Me:** Look, $AppOwner, I can’t help you if you refuse to cooperate. It is not required that I go down as it is not a productive use of our time to go through steps that will not help in resolving the issue. Pl-- *Phone dies*  \n\nNeedless to say I couldn't call back immediately. As it was the end of my day as well, I emailed him back and told him to contact the other IT on site (he didn't btw...).\n\nNow… that was long story… but, in the end... What I thought was the problem was wrong. I know... oops right?\n\nTurns out it was not an issue with the account number, nor was it an issue with the computer/internet settings. But I wasn't worried about that as troubleshooting involves being wrong... a lot... until we find the correct solution, so it was 100% expected that I wouldn’t get it right immediately. But as you can tell the issue wasn’t that I was wrong, but that $AppOwner refused to help me troubleshoot (i.e. refused to give me information to resolve issue).  \n\nTurns out, $User was using the wrong account, on his computer, but the other computer had his correct ID saved. Despite both $User and $AppOwner’s “testing”, neither noticed – kids that’s why you let the grown-ups do the hard work.  \n\nHowever, that wasn’t the worst part... $AppOwner then sent an email to my manager about 30 minutes later, as well as VPs &amp; the President chastising me for being unhelpful, and how the “customer is always right” and that I should do as I’m told. I had to go through 2 months of “conflict resolution” to resolve the issue between the two of us.  \n\nDon’t worry though. There’s a happy ending! $AppOwner is now on “Indefinite Leave of Absense”.\n\nTL;DR Get ticket to fix issue. Application Owner is uncooperative and won’t provide extra info. Get a complaint sent to Management. 2 months of conflict resolution – Application Owner is put in Indefinitely Leave of Absence.",

        "text": "TL;DR: Company president ignores IT department's efforts to make him look good, then embarrasses the department in front of the whole company.\n\nMy first full time gig in was as a LAN Analyst for $AutomotiveCompany. It was typical \"junior guy\" shit: changing backup tapes, end user support, swapping toner cartridges on printers, etc. The senior guy handled email, server, Unix support, that kind of thing. This was before the Internet was much of a thing, we didn't even have an Internet connection if you can imagine that.\n\n$AutomotiveCompany is small, less than 50 employees, and the president was, uh, how can I put this? He was kind of an idiot. We'll call him $Fred.\n\nEvery year, $AutomotiveCompany held their big annual breakfast meeting at a restaurant near the office. The IT dept was tasked with handling the AV setup, and this year $Fred wanted something new: a back-projected screen with a pipe &amp; drape surround for the presentation, and a \"remote mouse.\" Mind you, this was way, way before companies had these things just laying on tables in conference rooms, so we actually had to *rent* all of this from a $RentalHouse. $Fred was asking for floor-to-ceiling setup, so that would result in about an 8ft high screen after subtracting the drape at the top &amp; bottom. I called the rep at $RentalHouse to get a feel for the appropriate \"throw\" distance that we'd need behind the screen for the image size $Fred wanted.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, $Fred, I've never been to this restaurant and seen the space.  The $RentalHouse says that we need 18-20 feet behind the screen to get an 8ft high image. With the room setup you're envisioning, will there be enough space behind the screen?\"\n\n&gt;$Fred: &lt;nodding enthusiastically&gt; \"Oh yeah, *plenty* of room. Plenty.\"\n\nBased on Fred's input for the size of the venue, we get the $RentalHouse to provide the specific projector, screen &amp; pipe &amp; drape to meet the image size request, along with this \"remote mouse\"3 thing.\n\nOn the Tuesday before the Friday meeting, I get the \"remote mouse\" in hand and set it up to test it. I've never seen anything like this before, so I want to be sure I'm familiar with how it works before I have to show an exec to use it.  After my partner and I fool with, we agree that $Fred is going to need a little practice to be smooth with it.  I send $Fred an email explaining the situation and suggesting he come to the IT office where I have it setup to try it out.  Based on his enthusiastic reply, I expect he'll be down that afternoon. \n\nWednesday, I haven't seen him, so I send him another email reminding him. No reply. I don't see him on Thursday, either, so that night I pack up the remote mouse to be setup on Friday morning at the restaurant.\n\nFriday rolls around and I get to the restaurant over an hour ahead of time to get setup.\n\nSnag #1: Based on the initial room setup, there's only about 10 ft behind the screen for the projector.  Crap, not good.\n\nI run around with the restaurant staff and we re-engineer the tables some to provide a little more space, but the most we can get is about 12 or 14 feet behind the screen, and even then the screen will literally be right up next to one of the tables.  The $RentalHouse setup guys re-jigger the image, moving it up to the top of the screen which actually works better in this tight space to give clearance over everybody's heads. For an 8ft high image to work, guests would have had to be 15-20ft back from the podium/screen. We still wind up with a 10 ft wide, 8 ft high screen where the projected image is only about 7-8ft wide and 5-6ft high. Some adjustments to the pipe and drape make this better, but it still looks janky.\n\nSnag #2: The restaurant, on the top floor of a fairly tony office building, faces east. This is a breakfast meeting. The morning sun is streaming in the floor to ceiling windows opposite the screen, completely washing out the image. \n\nThis isn't the first time they've had this meeting in this space. They've been doing it that way for *years* at the same restaurant, in the same space. In the morning. The restaurant doesn't really have curtains across the window, either, because they're not normally open before lunch, when the sun is directly above or on the opposite side of the building.\n\nSnag #3: Because of the spacing of the screen from the wall behind it, and the location of the podium, the remote mouse (which has to be pointed at this sensor thing over top of the pipe &amp; drape) has to be manipulated even more carefully than when we tested it in my office. And the angle is all wrong so you have to pay attention. \n\nMy confidence that $Fred will be able to deal with any of this is waning, rapidly.  $ITVP shows up and I give him the thumbnail sketch of what's going on. $ITVP scares me a little. He's an old-school IBM mainframe \"Information Systems\" executive-type and reminds me of my grandfather, a WWII Navy vet, with his Brylcreamed hair, 1960s NASA engineer glasses and very, very conservative ties.\n\n$Fred finally shows up, 15 minutes before the meeting is scheduled to start. He sees the room setup and flips his shit.\n\n&gt;$Fred: \"This isn't what I want, at all!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Fred, you told us that there would be enough space behind the screen. There wasn't. We had to re-organize some things and this is the best we could do with the physical limitations of the space.\"\n\n&gt;$Fred: (noticing the sun coming in the windows) \"But.. now you can't see the pictures on the screen!! Lets turn the whole room around and put the screen in front of the windows!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Then the sun on the back side of the screen will wash out the image completely.\"\n\n&gt;$Fred: \"This is bullshit.\"\n \n&gt;$Me: \"I can't change where the sun comes up, $Fred. You need to see how this mouse works and practice with it for a couple minutes. Because of the angle to the sensor up there &lt;pointing&gt; it takes a little bit to get accustomed to how it works..\"\n\n&gt;$Fred: \"yeah, uh huh, in a minute.\" \n\n$Fred goes off to talk to the regional sales manager.  He comes back to the podium a few minutes later and I briefed him on how the mouse worked, including that the handheld had to be pointed *directly* at the sensor or the pointer would not move.  He's nodding the whole time, but I can see that its going in one ear and out the other.  He unenthusiastically gyrates the handheld kind of pointed at the screen, causing the pointer to sort of hop around on the screen. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Fred, I could sit behind the screen with the PC and just advance the slides for you using the keyboard, if you like. You'd just need to say 'slide' or something.\"\n\n&gt;$Fred: \"No, no, I don't want to do it that way. I've think I've got it.\"\n\nYeah, he doesn't have it at all, but we're five minutes from the start of the meeting and I have to get the welcome slide put up. I F5 the Powerpoint presentation and slide into my seat at the IT Dept table directly across from $ITVP.\n\n$Fred starts the presentation, and he's concentrating harder on trying to look \"presidential\" and not hard at all about using the mouse. He's only able to get the slides to change after 3-4 tries at clicking the mouse button on the handheld. He's waving the mouse at pretty much every place *but*  the sensor and becoming more and more frustrated, and you can hear it in his voice.\n\nAbout midway thru the presentation, he's clicking frantically on the handheld while its 45+ degrees off-axis from the sensor, and you can see his brow furrow.\n\n&gt;$Fred: \"You know, if we had an IT department that could actually make things work...\"\n\n$ITVP turns in his seat and looks directly at me, eyebrow arched. I hold up my hands and shrug my shoulders in that \"What can we do?\" gesture. He nods and goes back to watching $Fred struggle to finish the presentation. Afterward $ITVP pulls me aside.\n\n&gt;$ITVP: \"What was that all about?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I got that remote in on Tuesday, $Jim and I tested it, and I emailed $Fred to come down and try it out because it needs practice to use it. He never did. I followed up on Wednesday, nothing. He never tried it out until 5 minutes before the presentation. He totally wasn't using it in the way he should have, and he would have known that if he had-\"\n\n$ITVP holds his hand up.\n\n&gt;$ITVP: \"I think I have the picture, TheITCustodian. Thank you.\"\n\nThis is the first time in my professional career in IT I've had this kind of thing happen, so I'm sure that my job is on the line. \n\nWhat $Fred &amp; $ITVP didn't know that Friday morning was that I'd been interviewing at $BigSoftwareCompany, and after two rounds of interviews and an employment offer, I was only waiting on getting the formal offer letter from $BigSoftwareCompany before I gave me notice at $AutomotiveCompany.  That offer letter came that afternoon, and I signed it and sent it back.\n\nMonday morning, I met briefly with $ITVP and gave him my 2-week notice.  He was nonplussed but shook my hand, thanking me for my efforts and said he'd get that over to $HR ASAP and that he didn't see any problem with my end date.\n\nAn hour later, $Fred came into my office.\n\n&gt;$Fred: \"TheITCustodian, I just heard that you've given your notice. This isn't about Friday, is it?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"What do you think, $Fred?\"\n\nAbout 2 years later, when $AutomotiveCompany was about to go under, I got my buddy from the mainframe side of the IT department a job at $BigSoftwareCompany. Apparently it was $Fred's crappy \"leadership\" that eventually drove $AutomotiveCompany into the ground.",

While it was light on information, it seemed to be the same issue that another individual had opened up a ticket for at the same place.

Can you-\"\n\n&gt;SH: \"NO ONE ELSE CAN BE HAVING THIS PROBLEM!\"\n\n*Another silence falls on the call. I don't take pride is snapping on an end user, but there's that little twisted sense of joy that happens. And so, I snapped.*\n\n&gt;DI: \"Right. So, I'm trying to help you, ma'am. I'm not trying to be contrary or shoot you down. You're having an issue, and I'd like to help you resolve it. Okay?\"\n\n&gt;SH: \"Sure.\"\n\n&gt;DI: \"Right. So, $OtherManager sent me a picture from $OtherStore. I know it's from there because it has $OtherStoreRegisterName in the picture. You've confirmed you're getting that error message. So, short-term, we raise that limit to-\"\n\n&gt;SH: \"Three-hundred dollars.\"\n\n&gt;DI: \"That's going to require Treasury to approve it. I can set it to $CompanyStandard without any approval, or up to $SlightlyHigher with my manager's approval. Since this affects the amount for the entire site, it would need to go to $SiteManager so that I can get a written response. Now, long-term, you're having a network issue. Can you tell me if the registers are $Company-hosted or locally hosted?\"\n\n&gt;SH: \"Company.\"\n\n&gt;DI: \"Alright. I'll talk to $NetworkingPeople and see what we can do. Anything else?\"\n\n&gt;SH: \"No.\"\n\n&gt;DI: \"Thank you. I'll be in touch.\"\n\nAgain, I take no pride in rattling off on someone like that. But when an end-user is providing information that is detrimental to their cause, and insisting things like that no one else can be having that same problem, I just can't stand by it. I'd like to think I'm not a bad person. However, I did get some more information...\n\n*$DatIzzy was closing all his programs and getting ready to clock-out, because, well, it was that time of day! Of course, right before he can clock out, and end user calls. A brief fight breaks out between his work ethic and his selfishness. He'd wasted his lunch break getting home, and was the only one that had to go out in the inclimate weather, but ultimately he was a sucker and/or glutton for punishment, so he answered the call.*\n\n&gt;DI: \"Hi, this is $DatIzzy with $Company IT. How can I help you?\"\n\n&gt;OM: \"Hey, this is $OtherManager at $Site and $OtherStore. You've left me a few voicemails?\"\n\n*The two had a short conversation, confirming the issue, confirming that this was happening at multiple stores at $Site, and that there was contact already made with $NetworkingPeople as well as $Liaison.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*Further information was found the next day that there was a project being planned to have the registers moved from $Site-network to a $Company-network that would either be installed or set up. At the end of it all, $Shirley's ticket was closed and the problem ultimately merged into $OtherManager's ticket. They'll be getting a new network put in... eventually. And hopefully it'll be up to snuff. At the very least, it'll be in $Company's control, which means we have more power to take action. Ultimately, though, this is out of my power and area of expertise, but since they've been trying to do this for over a year now I can only hope that the site gets the changes they need, as no one ever did give me the answers I needed to get their limit raised...*\n\nEdit: lots of formatting.",

Thanks for looking into this, it has some serious potential for us as a value added service. Copying in $SD to let him know.\n\n&gt;$TD: $YIBI, while I appreciate the effort you have gone into for this, it is not in keeping with the way we would normally work. There is too much potential for this to go wrong and overwrite customer necessary databases. **YOU MUST NOT RUN THIS ON PRODUCTION SERVERS**\n\n&gt;$SD: $YIBI, this is fantastic, we had a customer who switched to another provider because we couldn't do this automatically for them and they didn't want to pay for us to do it manually. Please pop into my office when you get 5 minutes and we will discuss how we can upsell this.\n\n&gt;$SD (To me only) B&amp;%%£$£s\n\nAnd that my friends, is how I saved myself a lot of time and stress, and then was banned from ever using it again. However, the time for revenge is upon us! I am currently implementing $bigERPsoftware at my new place, and I will be sure to automate this process as far as humanly possible.\n\nWhy do I always get the crazy bosses??",

        "text": "Just finished lunch and decided to post this gem of a hellion story. \n\nSo some backstory: I used to work repair of all kinds. Once for a computer recycling facility, once for Apple as a tech, and prior to this job, I was in phone repair for about a year. I've posted on here in the past about mishaps at my old jobs, but I think this one may take the cake. \n\nNow I'm in wireless sales. A job I thought I would hate, but I've found I'm liking it a bit more than I thought I would. \n\n\n\nAnyhow, onto the story at hand. \n\nThis story isn't about our customer, but rather about our system. \nFor privacy sake, I'm not going to say which wireless carrier I work for, but let's get on with it. \n\nA customer comes in, his wife (the account holder) up and left him out of the blue, as he told it to me, and she cancelled his line, and then her own line and left us to go to Sprint.\nWhich isn't normally an issue. \nHe wanted to create a new account with a new number. Perfectly fine, so I grab a SIM card, and start the process, which entails inputting the IMEI, and the SIM card number. \n\nI put both in just fine, press continue. \n\n\"That IMEI is already activated on our network! Please make sure you have entered it in correctly.\"\n\nI think to myself, it must be because he was on the other account. \n\nNow, we used to be able to input a fake or dummy IMEI in case we had issues like this. But our company decides to roll out a \"security\" update to our IMEI system that prevents this. \n\nSo after some tinkering, and repeated failures, it's off to our technical support chat. \nI explain the situation, provide the required information, and wait. \nAfter the rep replies and we back and forth a bit, he explains we need the PIN number from the old account so we can release the IMEI from it. However this is impossible because the wife apparently changed her number after her venture to Sprint, we find out after the customer tries to call her old number. \n\nSo at this point, like doing a quick save with 1hp in the middle of an attack, we are progression locked. \n\nSo we're about an hour in and I decide I'm not going to give up on this guy. I close the chat, and promptly open a new one so I can connect to a new rep. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Iris L!\" the chat dings. This rep seems much friendlier and helpful. I give the rep the rundown, and after some back and forth she gives me a \"master IMEI\" to try with his account creation. \n\n\nI enter this in, and it seems as though its going to work. \nWe run through the account setup process, we're both feeling hopeful. \nAfter his account creation, normally where you'd pick the customer's rate plan, it splits out a nice red error saying \"Invalid IMEI. Please enter a correct IMEI to proceed.\"\n\nA little about our system: if anything at all goes wrong during account creation, the entire process freezes forcing you to start over from scratch. So this is one of those situations. Instead of letting me click the box with the IMEI number in it, and letting me edit it, it's greyed out and unclickable. Yup, progression locked again. \n\nSo I report back to the rep. It doesn't work. \n\nLong story short, we do this about 3 more times with different \"master IMEIs\", before I ask the rep \"Are you aware of the changes they rolled out preventing fake and dummy IMEIs from being used in our system?\" and after a few moments, she responds. \"Yes I was just reading about this.\" she proceeds to give me one more IMEI to try with, and low and behold, it doesn't work. \n\nI report back, and she tells me to please wait while she consults her supervisor on what to do. \n\nI agree, thankful my customer is so patient, and thanking him, as we both wait, he tells me essentially when it rains it pours, as this is just one more thing going wrong with his life at the moment. \n\nFinally we hear the chime of the rep chat, and we both perk up. \nShe says \"Okay, we are going to try creating the account on our end with a master IMEI, please wait.\" I respond with a humble \"Take your time, thank you.\"\n\nShe returns with great news, saying it worked and for me to please track the order on my end. I load up the transaction, it takes me to the payment screen after a few pages of technical jargon, and for a moment I think we are stuck, because the payment screen is frozen. The customer laughs at this and says \"I'm not holding my breath yet!\" I laugh and we continue to wait. \n\nAfter about two minutes, I'm too scared to close it because I don't want things to get even more bricked, and I'm informing my rep what's going on. After I send the message I open it back up to see that its finally loaded and I can finally check this poor bastard out. \n\nSo finally, after 3 hours of screwing around, this customer is able to leave with his S8+ that he paid for outright working on our network. \n\nSo to sum it all up, our geniuses in upper management somewhere decided that they would lock out the use of dummy IMEIs, which is fine, but in the process locks out tech support's master IMEIs, and provides no one with a way to bypass this system or any failsafes to rare occasions like this one. \nGood going, guys. \n\nThe killer to all this is the guy had to get a new phone number since we weren't able to access that old account. \n\nSometimes the user is smarter than the system. \n\nTl;dr: system update prevents dummy IMEI so customer who was on an old account can't use his legit IMEI because we can't access old account and we can't bypass with a dummy IMEI and tech support master IMEIs are also banned now. After 3 hours tech support finally finds a work around. \n\nEdit: autocorrect ",

We prepared to test it by flipping down the turntable and detaching the speakers. As we were untangling the speaker cables, the customer suddenly exclaimed \"OH! Never mind. I see the problem.

        "text": "I just found this subreddit, find it entertaining, and wanted to contribute.\n\nWhen I was in high school in the early 2000s, I needed a summer job. A family friend was a lawyer at a large law firm (~1000 employees worldwide, ~600 in the office I was in), and told me about his law firm's intern program. I applied and got it. The other interns were college students and did law firm stuff. I was a computer nerd (among other kinds of nerd), so I interned in the IT department. I ended up doing this for three summers.\n\nInitially I had a desk in the storage room and just did stuff internally in the department, like reimaging PCs that came in when a user got a new one or sorting through and organizing the mountains of old hardware in the storage room. When it became clear I wasn't a complete idiot, the help desk techs started sending me out when they had simple tickets that needed hands-on attention. Eventually I got a desk and a phone in the main help desk area and started answering calls. In retrospect, I got lucky, and the IT manager and help desk techs were all great, and it was a very positive experience.\n\nNow, as I said, this was the early 2000s, so home PCs were common but not universal. Some of the lawyers were young or just interested and were competent computer users, but a whole bunch of them were old guys who went through school when typing was something that women did on typewriters and had absolutely no computer experience beyond having one plopped down on their desk at work. A lot of these guys used actual dictaphones to dictate documents and correspondence to their secretaries, and had their secretaries print out any and all documents and emails so they didn't have to read them on a screen. (This was also the era when Blackberries were on their own network and were basically pagers that sent and received emails. I spent a LOT of time dealing with Blackberries.)\n\nOne piece of necessary background information: when people moved offices (a frequent event: the firm was on multiple floors of a building and one or the other of the floors was always being renovated), facilities moved all the furniture, but IT moved the computers. This was generally done over the weekend to minimize disruption for the attorneys.\n\nSo anyway, one Monday morning, I answer the help desk phone, and there is an irate lawyer on the other end.\n\n&gt;**$me:** Hello, this is the help desk, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;**$angryLawyer:** When you moved my computer to my new office, you broke it!\n\n&gt;**$me:** What seems to be the problem?\n\n&gt;**$angryLawyer:** It won't turn on!\n\n&gt;**$me:** Have you made sure everything is plugged in?\n\n&gt;**$angryLawyer:** Of course! No matter how many times I push the power button, nothing happens!\n\nI don't have anything going on, so I generate a ticket and tell $angryLawyer I'll head over to take a look.\n\nI arrive at $angryLawyer's new office.\n\n&gt;**$angryLawyer:** See? It won't turn on. *$angryLawyer repeatedly hits the power button... on his monitor.*\n\n$angryLawyer had had a computer in his office for about three years... and had never once turned it off or had to turn it on.\n\nI managed to explain the problem without falling down on the floor laughing, $angryLawyer had the good grace to be embarrassed and apologetic, and we went our separate ways.",

JACK is seated on one side in a studded baroque chair with an absolutely massive mug of coffee in hand, calmly sipping at it. Three suited MANAGERS are on the other side. One is nervously flipping through a thick packet of paperwork, which is clearly marked \" SUPPORT CONTRACT RENEWAL.\" The other two have their own copies, and are staring aghast at a number with zeroes after it - some would say not enough, others would say a ludicrous amount.*\n\nMANAGER 1: You've got to be kidding me. THAT is what you want to charge for a year's support?\n\nJACK: I think it's perfectly reasonable, given the circumstances and situation. I built you from the ground up, and turned what was a compliance charlie-foxtrot that would have had your investors running into a lean, mean industry-leading machine.\n\nMANAGER 3: Regardless, this is absolutely insane. There's no way we can spend this much money on one contract or cost center.\n\nJACK: You certainly don't have issues with it going to your \"special projects\" budget. \n\n*JACK makes huge sarcasm air quotes when he says special projects.*\n\nMANAGER 3: You... you have a point.\n\nJACK: Nor do you have issues with it being used for trips and such, where it seems that the quantity of hotel rooms is sacrificed for quality, it seems - one room at the Four Seasons when two at a Hilton would be more appropriate for a manager and his morally-lax subordinate with a markedly loose view of \"don't screw the crew?\"\n\n*MANAGER 2 starts to sweat bullets.*\n\nMANAGER 2: Nevertheless, I'm afraid we're going to have to terminate your contract. This is an unconscionable amount of funds, and we just can't approve it at present. We're going to bring in a third party for consulting.\n\n*JACK is nonplussed, and sips at his coffee.*\n\nJACK: I'd expected this, and I've prepared a statement.\n\n*JACK reaches over to his phone, taps the screen a few times, and music begins to play - \"You'll Be Back,\" from Hamilton.*\n\nJACK:\n\n&gt;You say\n\n&gt;The price of support's \n\n&gt;Not a price that you're willing to pay\n\n&gt;You'll sign\n\n&gt;The contract I handed you\n\n&gt;After that fat bottom line\n\n&gt;Why resist?\n\n&gt;Remember if that you don't sign this \n\n&gt;Servers won't be fixed\n\n&gt;Now you're making me ticked\n\n&gt;I run the web filter, remember, \n\n&gt;I log clicks\n\n*The MANAGERS all start looking around nervously.*\n\nJACK:\n\n&gt;I'll be back\n\n&gt;Soon you'll see\n\n&gt;All your systems are belong to me\n\n&gt;I'll be back\n\n&gt;Time will tell\n\n&gt;When projects languish in development hell\n\n&gt;Expenses rise\n\n&gt;Directors fall\n\n&gt;Remember, I'm the one who built it all\n\n&gt;And when push comes to shove\n\n&gt;Legal and HR will get the blackmail material that I have\n\n*JACK grins maniacally and starts tapping the table with his fingers in time with the music.*\n\nJACK:\n\n&gt;Da da da dat da, dat da da da da ya da\n\n&gt;Da da dat dat da ya da!\n\n&gt;Da da da dat da, dat da da da da ya da\n\n&gt;Da da dat dat da...\n\n*A crazed gleam appears in JACK's eyes.*\n\nJACK:\n\n&gt;Your coffers, I am draining\n\n&gt;You complain a ton\n\n&gt;But you'll all be canned well\n\n&gt;Before I am gone\n\n*The MANAGERS share nervous looks.*\n\nJACK:\n\n&gt;So, no, don't spend that budget\n\n&gt;It's my department's budget\n\n&gt;My support contract's budget\n\n&gt;(Sotto voce) Which I have spent on junkets\n\n&gt;(Normal) I mean hardware\n\n&gt;And software \n\n&gt;And systems\n\n&gt;And networks\n\n&gt;(Sotto voce) And blackmail...\n\n*The MANAGERS start at that, and look at JACK. He innocently continues.*\n\n&gt;I'll be back\n\n&gt;Like before\n\n&gt;I've got text messages, pictures, and more \n\n*MANAGER 2 pulls out his phone as it vibrates with an incoming message - some of the aforementioned material. His face whitens, and JACK waves it off.*\n\n&gt;You'll show love,\n\n&gt;I'll get a raise,\n\n&gt;My contract's good until my dying days\n\n&gt;If I leave,\n\n&gt;I'll up my rate\n\n&gt;And when I'm back, you I'll defenestrate\n\n&gt;Cause when push comes to shove\n\n&gt;I will slaughter the end-users\n\n&gt;To keep all my systems up \n\n*JACK smirks and sways side to side along with the reprise.*\n\n&gt;Da da da dat da, dat da da da da ya da\n\n&gt;Da da dat dat da ya da!\n\n&gt;Da da da dat da, dat da da da da ya da\n\n&gt;Da da dat - \n\n&gt;All the users!\n\n*The MANAGERS join in, rather reluctantly at first, but with a fervor that comes with terror after JACK deathglares them.*\n\n&gt;Da da da dat da, dat da da da da ya da\n\n&gt;Da da dat dat da ya da!\n\n&gt;Da da da dat da, dat da da da da ya da da da da\n\n&gt;Dat dat da ya da!\n\n*The MANAGERS collapse into their chairs, and JACK sips at his coffee with a triumphant smirk. A few seconds later, a cloud of smoke covers the scene, and we fade to a bedroom where JACK is curled up in bed with DIANA, his Russian Blue cat - complete with sleeping caps on both of them. He wakes up with a start, knocking the cat off his chest, much to her chagrin.*\n\nJACK: ...

We provide support for both the software and hardware, depending on the client's preferences and resources.\n\n# Our cast\n\n$me - me (duh!)\n\n$bob - Our luser of the day\n\n$cw - Co-worker (can be any, I'll number them if more than one pops up)\n\n# On with the show!\n\nMeet $bob, or maybe you already have. I'm sure you have one somewhere out there, he has ZERO clue with technology and calls all e-mail clients 'the Gmail'. Some of my co-workers consider him rude, some consider him funny and some just plain stupid. I consider him a bit of all of these, depending on what he's doing on a given day.\n\n&gt;$me: *usual help desk greeting*\n\n&gt;$bob: *says name* Hi, $me been a while.\n\nEvery time he tended to call the help desk, he liked to ask for me. I don't know why he took a liking to me, but we were on a first name basis.\n\n&gt;$me: Oh, hi $bob. How are you, what can I help you with? *while pulling up the user's information*\n\n&gt;$bob: Yeah, so I just got off the phone with $cw and she said to give it some time and call back. I gave it about an hour and it hasn't been fixed.\n\n&gt;$me: *uncertain* Uhh, give me a minute and let me look, okay? *puts the phone on mute*\n\n&gt;$bob: Sure thing, take your time.\n\n&gt;$me: *turns around to co-worker* Hey, did you talk to $bob? Says he was on the phone with you, any idea what he's talking about?\n\n&gt;$cw: ... I helped him out with some stuff, but then he was having an issue and I have no idea what it was.\n\n&gt;$me: Can you give me your ticket number?\n\n&gt;$cw: *provides the ticket number* You got it?\n\n&gt;$me: Yeah, I'll look.... *turns back to the computer and unmutes phone, pulling up ticket* Hello $bob?\n\n$cw had helped him with an issue that had to do with accessing his e-mail through another app on his $fruitTablet. The ticket indicated a further issue to do with e-mail, but since we don't really support their e-mail and he didn't know his password, she transferred him to their external HD to have him reset it.\n\n&gt;$bob: Yeah? I need help with my e-mail. It's the Gmail, you gotta help me $me, it's doing the thing!\n\n&gt;$me: Okay, $bob, you gotta be a little more specific. What do you mean by the thing?\n\n&gt;$bob: It's doing the spinny thing! It's been doing this for 3 days! I don't understand!\n\nI took a moment to think and then I asked him to confirm. I had a feeling I knew what he was referring to, but I wanted to be sure. I took a $fruitTablet and tested it out myself. Nothing was wrong with the e-mail. Though sure enough, I got a spinning wheel on Gmail that indicated it was trying to load. That's not all I noticed, though..\n\n&gt;$me: *mutes and /sigh* Are you serious? He's freaking out over this?\n\n&gt;$cw: *same one from earlier* What did you find out?\n\n&gt;$me: He's freaking out over his damn e-mail loading.\n\n&gt;$cw: This dude is crazy.\n\n&gt;$me: Yeah... wait 'til you find out why he's having the issue.\n\n&gt;$cw: *Now she's listening in, interested*\n\nThis particular client uses $fruitTablet with a decent data plan. Some of our reps are excused since they're out in the middle of nowhere and decent internet is limited, so the data plan is all they pretty much have until they get home. This isn't $bob's case though, as he's in probably one of the largest metro areas in the world where finding half-way decent Wi-Fi isn't hard. Unfortunately, most reps forget that the Wi-Fi option exists on the $fruitTablet and just use the data plan, which is a problem if you get Mt. Everest levels of messages every day like $bob does.\n\n&gt;$me: *unmutes* Hey $bob, are you on Wi-Fi?\n\n&gt;$bob: *fiddling noises* Uh, yeah?\n\n&gt;$me: Are you sure? Do you see a little radio icon or some dots?\n\n&gt;$bob: *completely ignoring what I just asked.* Yeah, I'm on Wi-Fi\n\nThis sequence continues for a bit. I'd say I wasted about 20 minutes trying to confirm whether or not he was on Wi-Fi. Most people get that it's radio icon, but not $bob. He was CONVINCED that the dots meant he was on Wi-Fi because \"it can get to the internet!\". It also included a re-install of the app, which didn't fix the issue either. \n\n$bob was pretty loud so, $cw heard the exchange word for word even though I was on a headset. He's not ear-busting loud like [I HAVE NO WALL!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/85ktq8/i_have_no_wall/), but definitely audible. She was having fun listening at the expense of my sanity.\n\n&gt;$me: */...* Are you *sure*?\n\n&gt;$bob: Yes! I'm on Wi-Fi.\n\n&gt;$me: $bob, do you see a radio icon?\n\n&gt;$bob: *more fiddling, assumed he was looking* */hmm*... No?\n\n&gt;$internalMe: *imagines beating this dude over the head with a keyboard while yelling '__THEN YOU'RE NOT ON WI-FI!!!!__'*\n\n&gt;$me: *keeping the smidges of composure I had left and kind of fidgeting* */ag* $bob, you're on __cellular data__. If you don't connect your $fruitTablet to __Wi-Fi__, it's going to continue to try loading. You have a lot e-mails and the app needs to load all of that.\n\n&gt;$bob: ... *silence*\n\n&gt;$me: $bob, if you see some dots and no radio icon, it means you're on __cellular data__. If you see the radio icon, then you're on __Wi-Fi__. Connect to Wi-Fi and let it load. \n\nI spend several more minutes walking him through how to connect to Wi-Fi and how to turn both cellular data and Wi-Fi on and off.\n\n$me: Do you have any further questions?\n\n&gt;$bob: Uhh, no... thanks. *hangs up*\n\n&gt;$me: *half-toss headset aside* */an* FFS, and it's only Monday!\n\n&gt;$cw: *chuckling* It's $bob what did you expect?\n\n# Epilogue\n\nI experimented myself after that call and figured out that, of course, $bob had been the architect of his own stupidity. He had swiped down on his e-mails, which triggers the refresh on the Gmail app, not just once but multiple times. Of course, the re-install made it worse since now it had to redownload all of his messages. He must've connected to a Wi-Fi network at some point though since he never called back about this issue again. He's definitely called in about other things, but that's for another time.",

It was an early Sunday morning, which was typically our slowest time, so I took more time with customers.\n\nThis particular day a little old woman walks quickly into my department, looking scared, tears in her eyes. She walks up to me holding her laptop and asks me why everyone is looking so calm. I ask her, why wouldn't they be calm? She looks me in the eye, scrunches her face, sobs, and says \"Because I deleted the internet, please help\".\n\n**What I wanted to do:**\n\nI ask her \"The whole internet? You deleted the internet?\" *goes on walkie* \"We have a code red in the computer department, we got her\".\n\n**What actually happened:**\n\nShe cries and explains to me that she was scared that the \"internet police\" were going to arrest her because she deleted the internet explorer icon from her desktop. She was under the impression that because she deleted her icon, she deleted ALL OF THE WORLDS INTERNET OMFG.\n\nInstead of normally sending her to the tech counter like normally with other customers who come to me with tech help, I sat her down and explained to her that she just deleted her access to the internet, and went to her Recycle Bin on her desktop and restored her icon. She realized how silly she was after I told her this and gave me a hug before leaving my store.\n\nMy inner demons wanted to mess with her, but I couldn't pull myself to do that.\n\n\nThis is a crosspost from r/talesfromretail\n",

She called us yesterday, telling us that she isn't able to display her screen on the external monitor, that it's never working, and that her tablet is always slow and she wants a new one because the current tablet \"obviously\" has an issue.\n\n\nSo I went to her desk to check the issue.\n\n&gt;$Me: Hello $User, I heard that you have problems with your external monitor ?\n\n\n&gt;$User: Yes, the USB cable (for the docking station) is plugged in but it doesn't work ! Office is not working either !\n\n\nAfter a quick check, all cables are properly plugged, the screen is turned on, so I'm starting to have a look on her tablet. I see a lot of pending updates and the USB drivers in the Computer Management are not properly recognized... so out of reflex, I check in the Task Manager the uptime of the tablet. It turns out that the tablet was on since 22 days and 4 hours. (Which isn't really surprising considering that a lot of people here think that it's a good idea to let their laptops turned on for entire weeks, leaving it in their locker each night, because it \"takes too long\" to log in on the computer the next morning...)\n\n\nSo after rebooting the tablet, allowing the updates to install on the computer, everything works fine.\n\n\nTL;DR =&gt; User let her tablet turned on for almost 23 days with a lot of pending updates and then starts complaining about her tablet being slow, asking for a new one.",

        "text": "Back in the days I worked at a technical service desk, which provided support for $Program, which let you do your taxes, earnings and stuff like this. \n\n$Program used a SQL database, which needed to be installed at a Server or your local PC. For this, you could use the free SQLExpress version.  \nIf you wanted to move $Program with a local installed SQL server from one PC to another, you first had to make a backup of the six databases. For this, you had to use the integrated backup tool. After that, you had to install a SQL Server at the new pc and change a few settings while installing. After that you must install $Program and move two folders from the old system into the new one, but delete two files before moving. Finally, you must restore the databases with the same backup tool. \n\nThere were instructions for this, which could be found at the install disc and online. The instructions weren't the best to be honest, but by reading them carefully, they could guide you through the process.\n\nSo I get a call from a friendly, competent user ($CU), which was able to read the manual. He followed the instructions, but his data is still missing.\n\n$Me: \"*dropping the standard greetings*\"\n\n$CU: \"Hello, I am trying to move $Program to another computer, but either your instructions are false or I am just stupid. I am trying this for two days now and I have installed and reinstalled the SQL server several times, tried differed versions and even restored windows.\"\n\n$Me: Oh, that does not sound good, can you describe the problem?\"\n\n$CU: \"Yeah, so I followed the instructions, I made a backup, installed the SQL server with the settings, moved the folder, deleted the two files before moving and restored the backup. $Program starts, but it doesn’t show any data.\"\n\n$Me: \"Can I remote in and have a look?\"\n\n$CU: \"Sure.\"\n\nI guided him through the remote process and I was on his computer in in a new record time, because he followed my instructions.\n\nFirst I checked everything what he claimed to have done, because of rule one. \n\nThe SQL server was correctly installed and the folders where also moved. $Program starts without any errors, so there was a connection to the SQL server. My next guess was, that maybe the database backups are corrupted.\n\nSo I opened the backup tool of $Program, navigate to restore. Then I restored the first database, clicked at the little arrow next to the box for the dropdown menu, which show the other databases and then I hear the phone dropping, followed by a **SMACK**.\n\n$Me: \"Sir, are you ok?!\"\n\n$CU: \"Yes, sorry for that. I had to smack my face at the desk!\"\n\n$Me: \"But why?\"\n\n$CU: \"I didn’t see the dropdown menu, so I restored just the first database. Now we have the answer for my first question. I AM stupid!\"\n\nSo we had a laugh, I restored the other databases and the customer was very happy, that $Program shows his data.\n\nHe ended the call with the words: \n\n\"Thank you very much! You saved the day. You are my hero.\"\n\nTL:DR\nUser gets harassed by a dropdown menu and gets saved by awesome Techsupportman\n",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster. English is my first language, so feel free to tear me a new one if I butcher it.\n\nA brief introduction for context:\n\nI work for a medium-sized software company and I support a suite of products which tie into various Microsoft offerings. Automation and management stuff, without getting too detailed. I am absolutely not, by any stretch of the imagination, \"Tier 1\". Although I do work directly with customers, I also work directly with our development team. I dive into verbose logs. I query dump files. I field product-related questions in our forums and from a number of internal teams. I test alpha and beta software. I write articles and create training materials. My Google-FU is excellent. My scripting knowledge is solid. I have access to product source code. I've been doing this for years.\n\nIn short, I know my shit, and I love my job.\n\nFor the most part, I work with a certain class of administrator: they may need a little hint, or they may not know the absolute best way to do something, but they have a good handle on it, and I can work with them to increase their working knowledge.\n\nSometimes, I work with real gems - the ones who have a deep knowledge of their role, their environments, and how to help me help them.\n\nSometimes, I wonder how the heck the person on the other end of the line was ever hired.\n\nBecause the main product which I support ties into several other Microsoft components, it can be sensitive to environmental factors. Windows host configurations, patching, networking, interference from other products, the usual stuff. Because of this, I am fairly often engaged to help isolate performance issues in the product. The root cause of these issues has never, in my experience, been an actual issue with my company's software.\n\nThere has been an influx of this type of engagement recently - I believe that it may be generally related to Meltdown and Spectre. One such case is how I met Goober The Admin.\n\nGoober complained of an intermittent and brief performance issue. Not reproducible, but annoying. On an average of once or twice a day, he received complaints from other admins that the product interface hung for several seconds before proceeding without an error. They were not performing similar tasks each time. Some days, there were no complaints. Some days, there were dozens. Since Goober didn't actually use the product, he just \"managed\" it, he did not experience the problem himself, so he was only going off of complaints.\n\nGoober inherited ownership of the product in his environment from someone else, and doesn't really understand it. It had always \"just worked\", so he had never had to troubleshoot any real problems with it. His installation was not well maintained - legacy components which were never intended to run with his current version were present and live, and the version which he was running was no longer even supported. We were making an exception even working with him.\n\nThe upgrade process from legacy software wasn't always great, and the installer didn't try to remove anything automatically, choosing to err on the side of data retention. I can get behind that most of the time, but it left Goober in a configuration that I completely expected would have problems. He had live components trying to talk to decommissioned and incompatible systems. They could be causing an issue, masking an issue, or exacerbating an issue. Either way, they should be removed.\n\nGoober refused.\n\nBecause he didn't understand the software, he didn't want to change it, and he didn't trust my recommendations. According to him, there was no change in the product, so there must have been some precipitating event which \"broke it\". He wanted me to identify that event before taking any action.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I would also prefer to have a root cause before suggesting changes. But I was talking about removing known causes of performance issues from the product in order to isolate the actual root cause. These are components which are tying into systems which no longer exist, and which are no longer even supported by Microsoft. He refused, because, according to him, \"It's been like that forever. If that were the problem, we would have seen it before.\"\n\nThe title of this post, is, verbatim, something which he said to me as I was reviewing a Wireshark capture in his environment, to rule out any intermittent authentications issues.\n\nWe cleared a product cache and the problem went away for several weeks. He re-engaged today, and still refuses to clean out the useless junk cluttering up his configuration. Instead, he demands that I identify a root cause and wants the case escalated.\n\nI need more coffee and more patience. Please, kind sirs: have pity on the poor vendor support software engineer.",

        "text": "*They have a saying in Chicago, Mr Bond: Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time, it's enemy action.*  \n- Auric Goldfinger; *Goldfinger*, Ian Fleming\n\n---\n\nIt was a long and glorious week of leave; the weather mostly cooperated and I thought of work only fleetingly - I had been assured that I could rest easily, knowing that another technician was covering my area.\n\nSo it was with little trepidation that I returned to work yesterday morning. I discovered that the covering technician had left some notes on the work he'd completed; not much, but about as much as I had expected.  \nWhat I had not expected, however, was two UPS units sitting on the floor of the workshop, with a note on them. No fault details, not even a job number - only that they had been removed from the same site. The units were identical; chances are that they were purchased in a single order, installed at the same time, and had been running a nigh-identical load for a nigh-identical period. It's not impossible for them both to fail in less than a week, and for it to be nothing more than coincidence.\n\nAt least, that's what I told myself.  \nI'm not sure that I believed me, even then.\n\nAs I sunk my teeth into the workload and returned to my regular routine, I let the coincidence rest in the back of my mind. If there was anything there worthy of further investigation, it would come to me eventually - after all, I had the physical units with me; once I had some spare time, I could dredge the event logs for anything illuminating.  \nSpare time, however, was not forthcoming - while my first job had appeared to be a routine touchscreen replacement, actually attempting to install the new screen led me to discover that the old combined USB+power lead was not compatible with the new screen, as the new screen used a different power connector. Fortunately, I had a USB+power cable to suit the new screen, but now I had to remove and replace the old cable - and this led me to the second discovery; the old cable had been run through an extremely tortuous path.  \nA considerable amount of time and effort later, I had the new screen in place, working correctly, and the customer was happy. However, the customer also had some \"Well, while you're here\" issues - while some of them should have been resolved by the screen replacement, at least one issue required some further research.  \nI was entering the requirement for further investigation into my job notes system when my phone rang. I recognised the number: it was from the Job Dispatch team.\n\n&gt; Job Dispatcher (JD): Hey G, what's up?\n\n&gt; ME: Not much, just finishing up this touchscreen replacement; it turned in to a bit of a nightmare. I should have expected it, on the first job back from leave.\n\n&gt; JD: Ha! Yeah, that always happens.\n\n&gt; ME: What's happening?\n\n&gt; JD: We've just had a job come in - a UPS is playing up.\n\n&gt; ME: That sucks - I've got no spares at the moment.\n\n&gt; JD: Yeah, *{cover tech}* mentioned that last week.\n\n&gt; ME: Alright, I'll just finish up the notes on this job and get on the road to... Where's the faulty UPS again?\n\n&gt; JD: It's at *{site}*.\n\n&gt; ME: Wait a second... That's the site that *{cover tech}* took those two UPS units out of last week!\n\n&gt; JD: Is it...? Yeah, actually, I think you're right.\n\n&gt; ME: Okay, I'm on my way. Something is going on out there, because you don't lose three UPS units in less than a fortnight.\n\n&gt; JD: Cool, just let me know.\n\n---\n\nAbout half an hour later, I arrived at the site. Chances are that - if the UPS actually had developed a fault - all I could do is bypass the UPS.\n\n&gt; Site Manager (SM): Hey! So we bypassed the UPS...\n\nBe still my beating heart.\n\n&gt; SM: ...and the computer is up and running okay, so it must be a UPS issue.\n\n&gt; ME: Okay. What was the UPS doing?\n\n&gt; SM: Oh, it was beeping all the time, just like those two last week. That means it's dead, right?\n\n&gt; ME: More often than not, but let me check it out, and I'll see if I can figure out what's going on.\n\nI plugged the UPS back in, and turned it on. I pulled up the internal Event Log; lots of \"Input voltage below alarm level\" entries for July 16, 2011, but nothing recent. On a hunch, I backed up to the Settings menu, and checked the internal date/time settings.  \nThe current date was set to July 16, 2011.\n\nI pulled up the Measurements menu, and checked the Input level: 215VAC. The nominal voltage is 240VAC, so the power is about 10% below the normal level.  \nI checked the alarm level: it was set at 15%.\n\n&gt; ME: Hey, SM?\n\n&gt; SM: Yes?\n\n&gt; ME: You've got a problem here with your electricity - it's coming out of the wall sockets about 10% lower than normal; it's only a couple of volts away from triggering your UPS alarms.\n\n&gt; SM: What would that do?\n\n&gt; ME: Well, for starters, it would make them beep all the time...\n\nOh snap. The two removed by the covering tech last week are most likely not faulty at all.\n\n&gt; ME: ...which may mean that I can reinstall the two that were removed last week, as they have never actually been faulty.\n\n&gt; SM: So what do I do?\n\n&gt; ME: Unfortunately, this is outside what I am legally allowed to cover; you need a licensed electrician for this one.\n\n&gt; SM: Okay, let me make some calls...\n\n---\n\nThe following morning, I called the site back. The Site Manager told me that the electrician had been unable to find any fault inside the site, but eventually discovered that the external supply from the town mains was at a reduced level. The town's electrical contractors were engaged, and eventually reported that most of the town is affected by the issue.  \nThey just didn't know what was causing it yet - because it was only reported the day before, *when the electrician called them.*\n\nI re-installed the two UPS units removed last week. At the very least, they're acting as surge suppressors and inverters, so the connected equipment is actually getting 240VAC.\n\n**TL/DR:** Third time's a charm - to discover an issue affecting a whole town for over a week, that no one else had identified or reported.",

        "text": "[My previous tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7p80uv/sorry_but_i_think_you_have_a_rotten_apple/)\n\nThis tale takes place in a completely different setting than my first tale. At my university, I am the chair of a small program that takes in donated computers, wipes the hard drives with DBAN, installs Linux Lite, and distributes them to students and local businesses in need of a computer for academic or business purposes. One student sent in their application and was approved. I'll call them C. They got their computer (and were very grateful) on February 27. I gave them my typical speech:\n\n&gt; So, this computer is running Linux Lite. It's similar to Windows, and there's a guide on the desktop that will teach you the basics of using it. The password for the user account is right here *points to sticky note on the laptop's lid*, so you shouldn't have a problem logging in. Once you do get in, I do suggest changing the password to something you remember and getting rid of the sticky note. **(The computers all went out with temporary passwords consisting of three random letters followed by three random digits.)**\n\nC said okay and thanked me, and both of us went on our way. This was the same old routine I'd been accustomed to for over two years- student handoffs were all pretty much the same.\n\nAlmost three weeks later (today), I get a text message from an unknown number.\n\n&gt; Hey NealCruco this is C. And I was seeing if you had the password. I guess it blew off the computer because I can't find it\n\nI immediately start wondering how I'm going to handle this. It's never happened before. I don't keep any record of the temp passwords- I barely remember them when I'm configuring the computer! After a quick Google search, though, I find that resetting the password without logging in is quite possible on Linux Lite, but it's a bit involved. I reply:\n\n&gt; Sorry, no. I do not keep any record of the passwords for distributed computers. It is possible, however, to reset the password. Could we meet at some time to do that? It's a little complicated.\n\nWe work out a time and place for the meeting- hopefully it will go smoothly. But this is exactly why I tell students to change the password- a sticky note on the lid of a laptop is not a secure place for a password! It will get lost like this, or it will eventually be taken advantage of by some passerby at the right moment. And yet, despite my explicit instructions to the contrary, the password still wasn't changed three weeks after I advised C to change it. I'm not surprised at all by this - I'm a long-time TFTS reader - but I am just wondering what makes someone leave their computer's password written on a flimsy sticky note on the lid.\n\n(As for how C got my number, it's no surprise. The initial approval notification is usually through email, but some students never check it- despite the fact that their student email is an official university communication channel, and they are responsible for being aware of all the messages sent to it. So often texting supplements email when I'm setting up the handoffs. This is one reason why the application form asks for both email address and phone number.)",

        "text": "# Background\n\nThis story is from before working at the CRM company I currently work at. At this time, I was working for a VoIP company as a tech. This is actually something that happened to a co-worker of mine and around 7 or so years ago, so some details may be fuzzy or embellished for comedic effect.\n\n EDIT: Due to the automod nuking my other post I will be forced to remove any links to the emotes I was using.\n\n# Our cast\n\n$cw - Coworker (can be any, I'll number them if more than one pops up)\n\n$me - me (duh!)\n\n$user - Our luser of the day\n\n# On with the show!\n\nIt was a normal-ish day, we'd had our usual rush of customers ranging from password resets to replacement devices. It was around lunchtime and, while I was getting ready to go out, $cw gets a call. I think nothing of it, and he nods to me telling me to go, saying he'll catch up. I leave to grab a spicy chicken cesar salad from a certain burger joint fairly close-ish to the place and come back. We sit fairly close-ish to each other so we can kind of chat over the noise of other techs, and while he's on mute:\n\n\n&gt;$me: You almost ready to go? I gotta have lunch dude, I'm starving.\n\n&gt;$cw: *holds up container* Gimme a few, still on this call.\n\n&gt;$me: Is this that same guy you got when I left?\n\n&gt;$cw: Yup, this dude's dumb as a post, I'm having him turn off *some settings on his router* see if that fixes it.\n\n&gt;$me: Whatever, I'm starving.\n\n&gt;$cw: You do you, bro. *hearing the customer gets off mute and starts chatting with the customer*\n\n&gt;$me: *starts chowing down*\n\n\nA few minutes more minutes pass and I can see from where I sit he's been on the call with this customer for a while (~30 mins by this point), not only that but this customer is fairly loud. I can hear his voice crescendoing, he's frustrated. $cw does his best to calm him down and succeeds... to a certain extent.\n\n\n&gt;$cw: Sir, sir--yes, I'd like to help you, but I can't if you raise your voice... Okay, let's try--... No--... Okay.\n\n*Indescribable noise from his headset.*\n\n&gt;$cw: Well, for that we can try resetting the firewall.\n\n*More indescribable noises, he probably had his voice raised, but not out of frustration.*\n\n&gt;$cw: Yes, the firewall. Well--... What? No, the firewall!\n\n*silence*\n\n&gt;$cw: *.... /?* Are you still there?\n\n*silence and then... customer spoke up..*\n\n&gt;$cw: *completely dumb-founded* .. Uhh, no? *.... /dum*\n\n*More noise*\n\n&gt;$cw: Sir, what I need you to try is disable the firewall...\n\n&gt;$user: *audibly* I HAVE NO WALL!!!!\n\n&gt;$cw: *mute and pull headset away* HOLY S$@$# that was loud! *picks at ear*\n\n&gt;$me: *having heard the customer loud and clear, nearly do a spit take with the cherry tomato on my monitor. Dying from laughter.*\n\nAfter a few more minutes he gets off the call. He partially managed to resolve the issue. It turned out to be something to do with the router's firmware. Upgrading it allowed for our product to function, but there were still minor problems. No big deal, he'd call back when he had more time.\n\nThe moment he hung up that call, he got up and didn't take more than two steps out the door before he started dying too. He had way more composure than I would have on that call, I lost it the moment $user spouted that (in)famous line.\n\nThe $user misunderstood completely. He was looking for a literal fire wall and, since his router was mounted somewhere in his kitchen and his kitchen was an open space in his house, yes, he had no wall. To this day, I still don't understand how you go from troubleshooting your router on your computer to looking for some kind of wall that's blocking VoIP traffic. \n\n# Epilogue\n\n$user actually called back a few weeks later to resolve the other minor issues that were unresolved by $cw's call. I didn't get the call, but I was told it was unremarkable by the other co-worker. For a few months afterward, we actually ended up making that a mini-code between us: \n\n- Couldn't figure out the issue? I HAVE NO WALL!!!!\n \n- User had an emergency that wasn't an emergency, but they considered it one? I HAVE NO WALL!!!!\n\n- User was a Cisco-certified Net Admin? I HAVE NO WALL!!!!\n\nIt was kind of a \"Hey, I need an assist.\" or \"Yo, check this out.\" Sure confused the hell out of a lot of co-workers.\n",

        "text": "Time for another story about my networker escapades. This time it is a tale of planning.\n\n*****\n\n**Backstory**\n\nThis was about two or three years ago, when i worked for our campus LAN team. We were responsible for Build and Run of campus networks, providing connectivity to all the people working in the company. Which also included setting up networks in new buildings. As most of our main locations were doing massive renovations in addition to a few newly created business units, people had to move somewhere. Said somewhere were rented office buildings. A lot of them. Too many, to be honest, i alone was juggling three simultaneously.\n\nEach building was declared a project and had a project manager. It was the same guy for all buildings in my case, so i knew him all too well. You can imagine him as an internal consultant, that people need to contact when they want to rent some office space. He knew all the stuff that needed to be taken care of and who had to be informed. The problem was that he was basically an internal contractor, he had to be paid internally. You can probably see where this is going, but i'll tell you anyways: Someone cheaped out.\n\n**People** \n\n$Cust: The customer. The Person responsible for getting the building ready for people to move in.\n\n$PM: The project manager. See above.\n\n$Lead: My leader.\n\n$ISP: The ISP that got the deal.\n\n$Phrewfuf: Mr. \"Didn't i have a bottle of Whiskey stashed somewhere?\"\n\n*****\n\nIt was a nice day in January of some year. Coming to work, $Phrewfuf already was wondering which of the two building responsibles would be the one crying the most. It was easier to prioritize one over the other if there was a significant difference in their tone, suggesting urgency. He was thinking about this on his way to work for he did not yet discover the doctrine of ~~not giving a damn~~ Zen.\n\nUpon arrival our hero was amazed. There were no emails calling for immediate action. No one expecting him to throw a bunch of switches into the company car and go save the world. The world or someone elses failed planning, that is. It seemed like it would be a great day. Even the coffee mug on our protagonists table looked like it was smiling, waiting to be filled by the machine.\n\nBut just as he was grabbing his by now filled mug, $Phrewfuf noticed a shadow forming. Darkness started to surround him. $Lead was standing right behind him, covering the light with his body.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi $Lead. What's going on?\n\n&gt; $Lead: Hi. Remember $Cust from Location X? They're planning to rent a building somewhere, can you take care of that?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: *crap, not another one* Well...i am kind of busy right now, kind of difficult to squeeze in another big project like this. \n\n&gt; $Lead: Yeah, i know. But the others are already covering for the two sick guys...sooo.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: I see. Well, i'll do my best. But i might need some help, depending on the size of the building. Send me the info you have.\n\nAfter receiving the emails from $Lead, $Phrewfuf went on to do a quick glance over them. He figured that a building was already chosen, the rental contract already signed and it even had a protocol from the last meeting some people had. Without involving the networkers. And there was no sign of $PMs name in there. This was bad.\n\nA quick call to $PM confirmed that he did not know about any of this. Thus the only way to get some info was to call $Cust directly.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi, this is $Phrewfuf speaking with central IT networking.\n\n&gt; $Cust: Hello, this is $Cust. Are you calling because of our network?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: *Wow, this guy must be Sherlock himself* Uh, yes, i've been told you're planning on moving some people into a new building. This of course needs network service. Can you send me all the requirements regarding that? Also, why didn't you involve $PM? He's always the one contacting us with requirements and stuff like that? Especially when you're planning to move in.\n\n&gt; $Cust: Sure, I'll send you everything. We didn't contact $PM because he is in a completely different location, plus we didn't get the budget to contract him.\n\nA few emails and some coffee spewed over the table later, another call was made.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Uh, hi, this is $Phrewfuf again. You're joking, right? *still trying to wipe the remnants of a perfectly fine coffee off the table*\n\n&gt; $Cust: Huh? What do you mean?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: You not only already rented the building, but also started to move furniture in there? And you're expecting people to move in in three weeks? \n\n&gt; $Cust: Yes. What is the problem with that?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...just to make sure that we both understand this correctly: You have not informed us in time so we could acquire the hardware required, you have no info on how long $ISP will need to get you that 10GBit line and you're planning on getting 250 people into the building in three weeks?\n\n&gt; $Cust: Yes, that is correct. And i expect you to take care of all that, as you're responsible for the network. And i will escalate if this is not done in time.\n\nThis called for a quick chat between $Phrewfuf and $Lead. The result was that our hardworking hero was to do what he could and ignore the time constraints as they were not realistic in the first place.\n\nA call to $ISP confirmed that they would need about three months to get the 10G fiber line to the building, provided that the weather does not drop below 0°C at any time, as frozen ground would make it impossible to instsall the fiber. $Phrewfuf informed $Lead about this, just in case, and dialed $Custs number again.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi. So...we have a problem. And by we i mean you. $ISP says they need about three months to deliver the fiber to the building. And delivery of the required components will take about two months plus a week or two for firmware updates and configuration, including getting an IP-Range with DHCP/DNS set up. Which means you'll have to wait with move-in until all that is done.\n\n&gt; $Cust: WHAT? THREE WEEKS? We want to move in in three!\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Months. Not weeks.\n\n&gt; $Cust: WHAT?! How is this posible that getting an internet connection takes that long?! We're an enterprise customer and it takes longer to get internet than it takes for me at my apartment? This is unacceptable, i'm going to call your superior.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...there's nothing i can do about it, it's what $ISP told me. I will inform $Lead about your call. Have a nice day.\n\n*****\n\nA day later, $Lead and $Phrewfuf were talking about this while grabbing a coffee. $Lead explained the conversation between him and $Cust in great detail. How he chewed $Cust for not involving $PM and how, upon being asked what can be done to accelerate the delivery of the network, he replied with \n\n&gt; Well, i can give you a shovel so you can start digging the trench for the fiber.\n\n**TL;DR:** Failure to plan on your side does not constitute an emergency on my side.\n\n*****\n\nPrevious Stories:\n\n* [Don't do the thing - Oops, i did the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4eqzlr/guys_dont_do_the_thing_it_breaks_stuff_oh_i_did/)\n\n* [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/)\n\n* [Personality issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ie176/netnotworking_personality_issues/)\n\n* [Internet of Sh...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7juazk/netnotworking_internet_of_sh/)\n\n* [Wait for it...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7oyi52/netnotworking_wait_for_it/)\n\n* [Hello Darkness my old Friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ui7e1/netnotworking_hello_darkness_my_old_friend/)",

        "text": "*Hi again! It's your friendly neighbourhood chemistry PhD student back with another tale of mechanical woe. This time featuring a panicked undergraduate student and a... biologist.* **shudder.**\n\n***\n\n**$UG:** The aforementioned undergraduate student.\n\n**$Biol:** The spawn of Satan. Also a biologist.\n\n**$Me:** The hero, obviously.\n\n***\n\nAs with my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7qszyo/a_tale_of_supermagnets_and_servers/), it's going to be necessary to give a little bit of background information to fill in the technical holes. A big part of organic chemistry (the interesting kind of chemistry) is purifying the things you make in the lab - often, they come out of the reactions with several impurities that need to be removed. There are a lot of ways of doing this, of which the most commonly used is [chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography). If you're a sucker (or your department is poor) you do this manually. If you're lucky, you have fancy machines that do a lot of the work for you. The most common of these is a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography machine (or HPLC), whose name kind of speaks for itself. In our department, we're lucky enough to have a mass-directed HPLC, which is connected to a mass spectrometer. So, you can tell the machine the molecular weight of your desired material, let it inject the sample, and it will collect only things with the weight specified (in theory). It's a great machine. It also breaks often, is fiddly to use, and requires a fair amount of setup and optimisation.\n\nI like to come into the department on Sundays. No-one else is here, and I can focus on slowly ~~killing myself~~ writing my thesis in peace. So, when some frantic knocking on the door of the lab disturbed my \"work\" (read: browsing reddit) yesterday I was pretty annoyed. I opened the door to find $UG looking somewhat panicked. (side note: this week was their last week to get stuff done on their main project).\n\n$UG: There's something wrong with the HPLC!\n\n$Me: Did you put your sample in the wrong slot? (easily the most common error, you'd be amazed the number of smart people who can't count to 10).\n\n$UG: No, I saw it pick the sample up, but then it didn't collect anything?\n\nI trudge along with them to the analytical room, and ask them to show me exactly what they did (the tech who would normally be in there obviously doesn't work weekends). To my surprise, they actually seem somewhat competent. They put the sample in the right place, and put all the correct bits of information in the right boxes for the program. However, when the machine started running, the source of the problem became pretty obvious if you were paying attention.\n\n$UG: Should it be spraying solvent out of there?\n\n$Me: **frantically pressing the big red STOP button**. No, no it should not.\n\nEssentially, the line that runs solvent into the top of the column had come out, and therefore the solvent (which flows at a rate of about 20 mL/min, which doesn't sound like a lot until you realise the width of the line is about 2 mm - the pressure in the line can get up to about 200 bar) was just firing out of the line into the fumehood and all over the *extremely* expensive machine.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of careful wiping down, I replaced $UG's sample with a blank vial of solvent, and tried another injection (at a much lower flow rate, instructing $UG to press stop if I shouted at them). Lo and behold, the line fired off the top of the column like it had been shot out of a cannon. This confirmed my fears: column blockage. Some idiot had managed to crystallise their sample somewhere at the top/bottom of the column.\n\nThe only fix was to spend around 2 hours making up appropriate solvent mixes (acetic acid/methanol, DMSO etc), and running them through at extremely slow flow rates, eventually dissolving the blockage. We then slowly increased flow rates with the normal machine solvents, and got up to the working flow rate with only a couple of minor heart attack inducing incidents.\n\nNow, to find the culprit. I went through the user log, and discovered that the last user of the machine before $UG was $Biol. Normally, when biologists use the machine they're purifying peptides (small proteins). These are big, hard to purify, and very hard to dissolve. So, they have a special column that they're supposed to put on the HPLC, then switch it back to the normal one. When you do this, you obviously need to flush the solvent lines of the machine quite thoroughly beforehand, to make sure you don't get any peptide into the non-peptide column. So, I had my culprit, and an explanation.\n\nCut to this morning. I sent a quick email to our technician, letting him know about the problem but that I thought I had fixed it. Then  I got to have the pleasure of going to find $Biol, and letting them know how they had spoiled my weekend. Which of course involved thanking them for distracting me from my thesis, as well as telling them they could have broken the £250,000 machine.\n\nCan't be too harsh after all, they're only a biologist.\n\n**EDIT: formatting**\n\n**EDIT 2: words**",

        "text": "Just before Christmas the company I worked for shut down with a week's warning. After unsuccessfully job hunting for a bit, I decided about 2 months ago to go into business for myself doing repairs for local folks. It's been pretty fun so far, definitely interesting and varied. Unfortunately I just had my first bad case.\n\nI'd gone to take a look at a PC that wouldn't boot. I've seen this a fair bit lately. I have no luck there, and even find I'm unable to boot from a Win10 USB, their bios just wouldn't do it. I decide to take the PC away with me so I can plug the HDD into my PC and boot from a USB on there. \n\nAs I remove the PC I notice the back fan is almost impossibly clogged with dust, and assume it must be broken. I put the PC in my car and head home.\n\nWhen I drag it out of my car, I notice loads of little brown pellets on the seat. Mouse poop. A LOT of mouse poop. I give the case a light shake and I'm not a fan of what I hear.\n\nAs it's a dry day I take the PC into the garden to open it, and I'm greeted with a less than great sight. A mouse has clearly lived here for some time. There's poop everywhere, pee has rusted some of the interior of the case. The smell is awful. I pop the side back on and consider my next move.\n\nA deep clean is the only option. I end up removing every single component (some of which have chewed up wires, including the rear fan) and pressure washing the case. It still smells bad and the interior of the case is permanently stained, but at least it's less of a health hazard now.\n\nI got Windows working again, slapped it all back together, got paid and got out. Up until now it's all been relatively pleasant, but this job I genuinely considered turning down out of principle.\n\nEdit: I snapped a couple of pictures while I was working on it. I'll post them later, potentially to /r/techsupportgore in an effort to double down on karma. Don't judge, yo.",

        "text": "I have just started my career as an IT guy. My background is actually electronics (O'scopes and signal generators and stuff like that) but this job was offering more than what I was earning, plus I could stay in the location I wanted, and I was offered training, regular raises, etc. So I took the plunge- and here I am, learning the basics.\n\nThe process of onboarding in my company took time for me to get certain levels of admin access. So I had to sit on my butt and just swipe the tickets I knew I could do when I saw them. One of these tickets was \"Keyboard/mouse not working\" that cropped up with regularity. Our KVM switches would just need to be unplugged and plugged back in, and boom. Problem solved.\n\nSo one morning I checked the incoming tickets, and found a \"Mouse not working\" ticket, and swiped it. It was tagged and flagged with all the important bits. VIP! Critical Outage! Work Stoppage! It sounded like the end of the world would occur if I did not appear five minutes ago to fix this problem. (So, like, every third ticket ever, amirite.)\n\nI wandered down to the user's office to see what was going on. The minute my foot hit the office, the guy was telling me that he had so much work to do, etc. He needed to get his mouse working right now, since he was a critical asset to the organization and so on. \n\nMy first surprise is that his mouse semi-worked- I saw him move it and it jerked wildly across the screen. I assumed at that point that he had an ancient ball-mouse, not an optical one, and it needed cleaning. So I picked it up and checked it. Nope, it was an optical mouse... odd....\n\nMeanwhile, he was informing me in no uncertain terms that I was accelerating the heat death of the universe by not solving his problem with my mere presence. I had to assure him that I had not gotten my TechJesus certification yet, as I looked closer to the mouse.\n\nIn a display of pure, technical brilliance that would dazzle Sysadmins everywhere, I peeled the scotch tape off his mouse that was covering the beam. To no great surprise, the mouse worked. The user huffed and informed me that he had no 'technical' training to 'investigate' his hardware, and then told me \"You can go now.\"\n\nI shrugged, and headed off to close the ticket, when I was stopped by a guy coming into the office.\n\nGuy \"Wait, are you one of the CSAs?\"\n\nMe \"Sure am. Responded to a work stoppage.\"\n\nGuy \" My bad. I didn't think he'd put in a ticket so soon. Let me guess, he screamed work stoppage and all that?\"\n\nMe \"How'd you know?\"\n\nGuy \"Anything that keeps him off Reddit and Youtube is a stoppage. Sorry that I didn't fix it before you. I'll be better in the future when I mess with him.\"\n\nMe *Solemn nod.*\n\nI closed the ticket with \"Minor mechanical issue the user had no training to handle.\" in the notes. And I put the user's name in my special notebook. Always keep track of these guys, this I have learned... and my journey is just beginning. Thanks to you, TFTS, for keeping my feet on the ground.",

This organ has fourteen ranks of reeds, totaling over 500 individual units that have to be tuned, compared to the three or four ranks that is usual on the single manual reed organs that make up a majority of the work that we do. I sit down and have a play, and everything seems fine. It's all in tune as far as I can see. \n\nMe - This seems to be fine, are you sure you want it tuned?\n\nIO - yes! It's way too loud! I want to be able to practice quiet things with it!\n\nMe - ahh, thats not a tuning problem, thats a blower problem. The blower's working too hard. Retuning won't do anything. The best course of action is to get some sort of Variac on the power supply so you can turn the blower down.\n\nIO - Oh, ok. I'll do that then\n\nI return to the office. \n\nNext day, and this time my boss is in. The phone rings, he answers. He has a short conversation, hangs up and walks over.\n\nBoss - Did you go and see IO yesterday? He's saying that you were rude and refused to tune his organ.\n\nI explain what had happened, and Boss goes and rings him back and just tells him what I told him.\n\nA week passes. I get a call from the president of the local reed organ society. \n\nPres - Hey, have you had any trouble with IO?\n\nMe - uhh, yeah. He asked us to tune his Gideon last week. It didn't actually need tuning, just a Variac on the blower cable.\n\nPres - yeah, well he's called every organ tuner in the state and they've all said the same thing. So he sent me an email this morning saying that we were conspiring against him and that he's going to sue us and write an article in BigStateNewspaper about how we're corrupt and the customer is always right and how we're all cheapskates and so on and so on. Just letting you know in case he calls back.\n\nHe did actually try to sue us. Judge threw it out .\n\nTL;DR guy buys a reed organ that is in perfect tune and tries to get someone to retune it, and then tries to sue us for doing our job. \n\n",

There's a new person starting next week in one of the offices I support remotely. [6+ interstate sites, 125 users in toto] - I wasn't sure exactly which cubicle he was going into, and since there were a lot of empty ones, we hadn't connected all of the network ports from the patch panel to the data switch, so they aren't necessarily all live. One of the more recent additions to the office was tapped to help me with the connection.\n\nI started by telling him I needed to know the labels on the jack in the cubicle, so I could look them up to see if they were connected or not. He emailed me back 10 min. later saying \n&gt; \"There are 2 jacks, Dxx and Vxx. The phone is plugged into Dxx, has dial tone, and is displaying ext. xxxx. Vxx doesn't provide any connection.\"\n\nThat was so unexpectedly thorough and full of initiative that I damned near did a [happy dance](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CH8xTWVWgAAWhXf.jpg) in the middle of the office. Because he told me everything I needed to know, including some things there were alluded to in the email chain, but that I hadn't actually asked for. I kind of want to hug whoever hired him.  -- K",

        "text": "Hey TFTS,\n\nAs a long time lurker of the subreddit and with no worthy story to tell, today I can finally say I have one.\nIt stars me as \"Me\" and my boss as \"Boss\".\n\nTo cut to the chase, they had tasked me with upgrading the phone system as they had experienced a power outage and it took out the working PBX at the time and they were running on a backup PBX for the time being. This backup PBX was running an outdated version of FreePBX but our phones were outdated too. (we had Cisco 7940s.) They had modified the firmware on these phones to work with Asterisk.\n\nAs it was unusual to be working on this side of IT. It did take me a little longer than I had planned to figure out how VOIP worked. What essentially happens is a call comes in goes to a IVR. (Think, \"Press x for department.\") From there, it goes to a queue that fails over to ring group with the department required. \n\nSo this morning before our call hours (9-6) I switched the phones over to the new PBX. I did *test* to ensure we could call out and the PBX was getting calls. \n\n&gt;Me: *\"Testing finished.\"*\n\nLittle did I know that when a call comes in it goes through everything gets to the queue but does not get to a callgroup.\n\nThis meant that the call was left hanging in a queue with no agents in them and listening to jazzy music until they hungup. The ring groups were setup as a failover destination. \n\nHow did I realize this? \n\n&gt;Boss: \"You tested the new PBX to make sure we got calls?\"  \n&gt;Me: \"Yes, why?\"  \n&gt;Boss:\"We have not gotten any calls so far this morning.\"  \n&gt;Me:\"I'll check the logs.\"\n\nAfter that conversation I decided to call the company number. I realised that the calls did not failover due to the timeout being set to infinity. Once I changed that to 5 seconds. \n\nThe unfortunate happened.   \nCalls came in.\n\nTLDR: Calls came in but did not reach a phone until I changed a setting.",

        "text": "I work at a call center for an ISP. \n\nBefore we begin, a little background on how our systems work. Our modems are 2in1 modem/routers. We charge separate for wifi. \n\n*if you don't want wifi, we automatically bridge the modem and disable DHCP*\n(because if you don't need wifi, you either have your own router or are 80 and have a single pc connected via ethernet)\n\nMe is me. \n\ncaller is guy, because he was a guy. \n\nMe: hi, thank you for calling ISP, my name's me, how can I help you today? \n\n\nGuy: hi me, I'm just trying to get my internet working. All my wifi devices are connecting, but my PC isn't getting internet. \n\nrattle of my script about apology and gonna help, etc. While looking at the account. I see wifi was removed 3 months ago, so he has to have his own router, and I see two devices connected to the ports on our equipment, so I instantly know what the problem is. Two devices on a bridged modem. Swap PC to his router and we're golden. \n\nMe: I see here that you don't have our wifi service, do you have your own router? \n\nGuy: yes (breaking news, user ignores rule 1, tells truth. More at 11)\n\nMe: OK, and I see that the PC is plugged into our modem, can you unplug it from there and plug it into your router?\n\nGuy: it is plugged into the router (cancel breaking news, users still lie) \n\nMe: I see it's plugged into our equipment, can you please switch it over to your equipment? \n\n\nMe and guy proceed to go back and forth about what a modem is, what a router is, how they work together, what our 2in1 is, what bridging does, and what HIS router is (he never stopped referring to it as his \"wifi system\" and refused to call it a router.) \n\nThis went on FOR AN HOUR, in which he didn't ask questions so much as either demand an answer or make a false statement and wait for me to correct him. It was the most frustrating hour long crash course in home networking I've ever done... By the end, I was calling his router a wifi system and calling our 2in1 the \"2in1 modem router combo device\" every time I referred to it. \n\n\nAny attempt to get him to just shut up and do what I tell him was met with more \"questions\", until finally, \n\nGuy: why would I have to do this? It's been working like this for 3 months.\n\n\nI legit don't know the answer to this. It happens all the time, but I just tell people their device held on to the (1hr) IP lease for several months and it expired when the problem started. If you have the actual answer please let me know. Anyway, \n\nMe: excuse from ^\n\nGuy: ... Alright. \n\n*moves one ethernet cable over* \n\nGuy: oh hey! It's working now... I guess my wifi system is sort of like a router...\n\nMute into facedesk combo\n\nDo call closing stuff, guy thanks me for all the information... \n\n\nTl;dr call could've been done and over with in 5 minutes. Had to give caller an hour long course on home networking so that he could move a single ethernet cable. ",

        "text": "Some time ago (this story is about 10+ years old) I worked for a large 16-18 college.  This place had a principal and a number of deputies, who ranged from okay through to awful.  This is a story about the most obnoxious of them.  It happened to another tech in my team, but I was around for it.\n\n\n\n$ObDep - Obnoxious Deputy\n\n$Tech - Technician colleague\n\n\n\nThe principal's wife had recently been issued with a Blackberry at work, so he and his deputies decided that they all needed them.  Our team specced up everything they'd need (including the Blackberry Enterprise Server etc.) and came back to them with a five-figure cost which was clearly ridiculous for the limited benefit they would provide.  They decided to go with it anyway, but to cheap out on handsets, bare minimum contracts, no roaming, etc.\n\n\n\nSo... they've been running this for about a year or so - most of the handsets checking in once a week at best (because they're hardly ever switching them on, never mind using them), when $ObDep phones in.  He's shouty from the off, and is the kind of guy who regularly threatens people's jobs over minor inconveniences despite not having the power to actually directly fire us. \n\n\n\nHis Blackberry isn't picking up his emails.  We pass him to $Tech, as he's the only one with access. $Tech checks the BES, and his device hasn't checked in for a week.  He's one of the few who does use it, so this is unusual.  $Tech starts the usual list.  Is it making calls? (Yes)  Can he send an email? (No) Can we send him an email? (No) Restart device.  Pull battery for 10 minutes and try again. Check enrolment. Nothing's working.\n\n\n\n$Tech finishes up the phone call with a promise that we're doing our best to get him back online ASAP.\n\n\n\nInvestigations commence.  All of the other devices check in at some point over the next three days, and all the while we're taking further calls from an increasingly irate $ObDep.  In some of these calls, he's literally screaming about how effing incompetent we are.  We ask him to bring it in.  He's \"too busy\". We ask him if we can come to him. It's \"not convenient\".\n\n\n\nSome of you will have twigged already.\n\n\n\nIt's drifting towards close of play on day 3 when $ObDep calls to scream at us some more.  $Tech is at the end of his rope.\n\n  \n\n$Tech: \"I'm sorry, but there's literally nothing more I can do without access to the device.  We need the device on site to find out why it isn't checking in.\"\n\n$ObDep: \"THAT'S RIDICULOUS.  I CAN'T BRING IT IN. I'M IN EFFING SPAIN YOU MORON. DO YOU EXPECT ME TO FLY HOME EARLY FOR THIS?\"\n\n$Tech: \"No, of course not, but... hang on... you're in Spain?\"\n\n$ObDep: \"I'M NOT CUTTING MY HOLIDAY SHORT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO YOUR EFFING JOB PROPERLY.\"\n\n$Tech: \"But you opted not to have roaming on your contracts.\"\n\n$ObDep: \"WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING? THIS IS ABOUT EMAIL.\"\n\n$Tech: \"Email uses data.  Without roaming, you have no data when you're abroad.\"\n\n$ObDep: \"WELL SWITCH IT ON THEN IDIOT\"\n\n$Tech: \"I would if I could, but this is a contract issue, not a server issue.  It has to go through the mobile phone company.\"\n\n$ObDep: \"I EXPECT THIS WORKING WITHIN THE HOUR.\"\n\n\n\nThe phone goes dead.  He wasn't on speakerphone, but the office isn't that big, and he had been VERY shouty.  $Tech speaks to the leadership team people about authorising the expenditure, phones the mobile phone company - and yes, they'll put that through for us right now.  It'll take 3-5 working days to take effect (because, ten years ago).  $Tech explains, asks what can be done to speed it up, and is told that's how long the system takes to update and activate the new contract.\n\n\n\n$Tech calls back $ObDep.  $ObDep tells him we're all getting fired as soon as he gets back.  $Tech's boss phones $ObDep and tells him the same re: outcome. $ObDep tells him the same.\n\n\n\nA week later, $ObDep gets back and we hear no more of it.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Back when roaming was expensive, senior person decides it's unnecessary, then goes abroad, then threatens to fire us all when he can't get his email. Nobody got fired.\n\n\nEdit: Formatting.",
