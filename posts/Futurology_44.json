        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe that job losses due to the development of artificial intelligence can eventually be dealt with through social institutions.  I don't think there is a possibility of a dystopian future where ai dominates humans.  However, there is a fear that artificial intelligence will invade humanity's uniqueness and harm its fundamental enjoyment. I believe that the active pleasure that humans get from producing something is greater than the passive pleasure that we get from consuming something. Assuming that much of this active pleasure comes from the pleasure I produce that is not in this world, but if these outputs that can be produced within human capabilities are produced in advance by AI (AI is not physically constrained, so the output will be much faster than that of humans), I think this pleasure will be greatly diminished. All the reasoning I made in my head, every number of chess I could play, every article I could write would be useless if all these things were already achieved by AI. All the reasoning I made in my head, every number of chess I could play, every article I could write would be quite empty if all these things were already achieved by AI. \n\nEventually, I fear that people will lose their enthusiasm for productive activities and become passive beings who only accept the output of artificial intelligence. Figuratively speaking, I fear that humans will no longer be explorers and will become only tourists. Therefore, even though I am a person in the hard science field , I wonder hope is in soft sciences such as the humanities, which presuppose pluralism. Soft science is three-dimensional, so AI won't be able to fill every field. I'm not an expert on artificial intelligence, and this is just a subjective feeling after reading just a few books on artificial intelligence.",

        "text": "I surprised that almost no one noticed, but In one of the recent interview (link below) Sam Altman revield what's next for OpenAI's models (hence GPT4) in a next couple of years:\n\nFirst of all, predictions that Sam said is articulated, by his own words, is areas on wich research been already done and scaling laws applied. So this is a really high-certainty predictions. (Timestamp: 13:12)\n\n1. Human level Chatbot that works this time around (ChatGPT is just introduction to ChatInterface wich GPT4 will also have) and poses actual threat to Google. (Timestamps: 1:25; 10:25) So GPT4 will be super accurate in its factual answers unlike ChatGPT. Because it is accurate it can be finetuned on different specialized topics and be reliable in those specializations. Virtual Tutors, Medical Assistants, Lawyers assistants etc. This finetuned models of GPT 4 can be realy disruptive and create a wave on new billion to trillion buisnises in all the spheres (18:23).\n2. Improvements in accuracy will come from big algoritmic progress.(10:38) In a 5 years thers will be no prompt engeniring (25:22)\n3. GPT 4 will have Full multimodality from text to image to audio to video and smooth switch of AI between the modalities. (10:49) (1:47) It will allow people to train GPT4 and ask it to use all computer intefaces: internet, programs etc. People will be able to automate almost every repeatable software tasks with Virtal Assistant GPT4. It will alow a drastic increase in productivity of proffesionals in all the fields. Wich will acelerate the sciencific porgress and everything else like 10 fold wich brings us to the event horizon even faster than now.\n4. GPT4 will be able to continusly learn (11:04). So next big model will have an abilty improve over time in its tasks, gain expirience and dont be static as todays Language Models. Sam also mentions selfimprovement systems here (8:56). Sam mantions example on (25:49) : \"Goo off and do this research to me and to this complicated thing, or just be my therapist and help me figure out how to make my life better, or go use my computer and do this thing, or any number of things\". Those capabilites alone (he said) will change the worlds economy, and bring a genuane technological revolution.\n5. GPT4 on is actually can be so smart that will not just be able to reproduce any human activity in virtual space (wich can make the cost of intellegence gone close to 0) but be able to create new knowledge and add to summ whole of scientifc knwoledge on its own (4:21). Sam said that he's been pleasantly surprized on what seems to be happening in a new knowldge generation field inside OpenAI's labarotory NOW (11:38)\n6. This abillity to generate new knoledge will alow GPT4 to become AI scientist and improve itself without peoples help or show them directions of improvement. And OpenAI want to automate their jobs first as AI developers 0\\_0 And ask AI to help them to solve an Allignment problem (6:24) (9:24)\n7. 10% of company concetrated on research alone wich led to the huge wins. (13:30) Then he stops, and thinks on what to say. By the bodylanguage you can see that he do not want to reveal something huge. Then he continues and after a stupor says, \"Oh a fell bad to say this (Why? Becouse he's not allowed?): \"I doubt we'll be using transofrmers in a 5 years, i hope we find something better\". Given the connection of thought to the companys research wich led to the huge wins, and accent on research on a totally new paradigm (13:49), i think its can be a hint to the new Language Model architecture, that'll replace transoformers and lead to possibilites mentioned above. I hope it leads to a long-term memory.\n8. Sam mentions that his friends and collegues desided to not have children becouse of AGI. Hinting that in his circle AGI is an obvius and done deal. They now something that dircetly affects the vital decisions in their lifes (23:29).\n\nGiven that microsoft president Brad Smith said to Reuters \"We're going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected in 2033. It's going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft's future, but for everyone's future,\" I excpect GPT4 to realiese in 2023, but before the relise, the year can be packed with other smaller reliseses.\n\nMy prediction for 2023: Codex 2 in first quarter, Dalle 3 in second quarter(or viceversa), text to audio and text to video models in betwen, and GPT 4 at the end of the year or 2024.\n\nWitch certinity we can said that the next 10 years will drastically change our lifes and the history of humanity as we know it. There can be a lot of chaos because humanity never faced technology that can take away meanings of peoples live (status, uniquness of human intellegence, art and labor). The next decade will be decade of New Values, Philosophy and i hope Spiritual Growth. Or it can be bad, realy bad.\n\nlink to the interview: \"cannot be posted on Futurology\"",

AI can be trained to replicate and create images right? Why not apply it to animation and make it 10Xs easier.  It will give animators full autonomy to create what they want and creators will be the only ones to reap the rewards from their creations. This will dissolve larger animation production companies and as we all know treat their workers inhumanly. Animators will become their own bosses.",

        "text": "As I understand, one method we try to do fusion is by holding the plasma in a magnetic field. The reason is there is no material to withstand the heat.\n\nNow my simple idea: why do we not keep the plasma moving in an ordered, infinitly long path by keeping in moving along a ring, directing it with magnets. \n\nMy intuition tells me adjusting direction of a „projectile“ should be easier than „reflecting“ it. Also, keeping a massive amount of bullets in an ordered path seems simpler to control than chaotic movement inside a ball.\n\nJust wanted it to get out there. I guess there is something quite basic Im missing, but I still would like to understand.",
