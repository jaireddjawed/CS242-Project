        "text": "Qubes  is a security-oriented operating system. Its now fairly mature. It  brands itself as being 'reasonably secure'. Its based on the Xen  hypervisor, and Fedora, Debian and Whonix OSes. I'll let you do your own  reading if you want to know more.\n\nIts  not without problems, though. Security is inversely proportional to  convenience ( &lt;- apparently from the first Unix handbook). This is a  good summary of Qubes. I find it can really disrupt workflow.\n\nThis is an account of Qubes for prospective users.\n\nI've been using Qubes for 5 years. I'm not technical, I'm not a power user. I am not using high-end hardware.\n\nI  run Qubes on a Lenovo Thinkpad x230 (with Coreboot and ME\\_Cleaner  applied): i5-3320M CPU @ 2.6GHz, 16GB memory (the maximum it can take),  with an SSD.\n\nI make comparisons to  my second, less powerful machine, a Lenovo Thinkpad x230 i3-3120M CPU @  2.5GHz, 12GB memory, with an SSD. It runs a normal Debian-based distro.\n\nIts  important to know as you read this - if you don't already - that Qubes  achieves its security by isolation. It gets that by compartmentalizing  everything in separate virtual machines (VMs).\n\n**Irritations that make me question my choice to run Qubes:**\n\n**Slow**\n\nHere's  an example: I am launching my Firefox instance (with existing tabs from  a previous session) in my Personal VM (virtual machine). This VM uses a  VPN, so that will automatically launch as well to provide networking,  as a prerequisite to Personal VM. Here's the timing:\n\n* 0s            Q-button &gt; Personal &gt; Firefox to launch\n* 1m 10s   VPN VM is up and running.\n* 1m 55s   Personal Firefox window appears, but tabs aren't yet reloaded.\n* 3m 09s   Uppermost Firefox tab now displays/reloaded content.\n\n3m 09s. To launch a webpage. That sux.\n\nTo  test this, I've just done that all again  but with a different VM,  after a restart of the machine: 3m 09s again. Now for a third time: this  time only 1m 28s. I can't point to any factor that could cause the  difference.\n\nThat's an average of 2m 35s to reopen a webpage in Firefox.\n\nFirefox is an offender here. I have typically 10-20 tabs open at any one time and 10 extensions (Firefox Recommended).\n\nOpening  a Firefox instance with no extensions, in a fresh, stock Fedora-based  VM (i.e. a regular disposable VM) that doesn't use a VPN to connect to  the internet, takes 1m 32s to get to the Firefox startpage.\n\nIf  I open Personal VM again - but this time with the VPN VM already up and  running - it takes 46s to start the machine, but Firefox displayed a  fully functional tab at 1m 00s.\n\nMy ‘normal’ laptop takes mere seconds to open Firefox with a VPN running.\n\nBoot  up to ‘ready’ – including the disk decryption and the login – takes me  around 3m 10s. Just for the record. Getting to a working VM from a  powered off stance can take around 6-7 minutes.\n\nSo there you have it: nothing is quick and sometimes its very very slow. Security is inversely proportional to convenience.\n\n**Focus hijacking**\n\nFocus  hijacking is what I call Qubes’ habit of opening its VM right over the  top of whatever you are working on. Because of that, because it takes so  long to open things, but because it will open the window long before it  has finished setting up the application (e.g. browser tabs), its  pointless to get on with something else while you wait. You’ll just be  interrupted, like someone shoving a newspaper under your nose while you  are writing something. Maddening.\n\n**Updater**\n\nQubes  has a special app for handling updates (after all, it has at least 5  different 'guest' OSes to keep updated). Usually once a day there is an  update to at least one of the distros Qubes uses (usually Fedora). The  updater app is slow, clunky and resource-heavy. My fan starts running  every time, and sometimes the system becomes visibly sluggish. The  Updater requires a manual start, and once started it will run to  completion - the 'cancel' button doesn't seem to work at all. It tends  to run \\~5-10 minutes (a guess, not measured). You have to deal with this  pretty much every day.\n\nOnce  you've updated, all the individual VMs that use that OS need to be  restarted. They need to be shutdown and started in order (e.g.  application VM shutdown, then VPN shutdown, etc, etc then VPN restarted,  then application VM restarted). Its so time-consuming its best to  shutdown and restart the entire machine. Since boot-to-ready takes me 3m  10s, getting back to where I was working can take around 7 minutes.\n\n**Connections**\n\nQubes  is built on clever isolations. Its probably no surprise that connecting  anything is just harder in Qubes. That includes: VPNs, SSH, printers,  cloud services (at least using them for backups) and USB devices. Some  devices will just never work, it seems, like smartphones (I’ve tried 3).  So don’t throw out your other laptop!\n\nDoing something new, trouble-shooting and problem-solving\n\nBasically,  Qubes adds another layer of complexity to whatever you are doing. Your  resources for figuring things out are reduced to the documentation (not  always what you need) and the community (good but has its limits). This  compares with the oceans of Linux-relevant material available for almost  every other distro – its a big difference.\n\n**Lock-in (sort of)**\n\nWith  Qubes you split your activities across different VMs. With just a  handful of these VMs, each with its own files, (e.g. documents,  spreadsheets), and browser with bookmarks, histories, etc., you  effectively have several independent computers' worth of stuff to back  up. Were I ever to transfer it, not only would it be tedious to extract  from Qubes, assembling all those Home folders and subdirectories into a  unified system on a normal distro would be a real pain.\n\nQubes  offers its own backup tool (again, its not quick but I don't think we  should expect it to be). It creates backup files that can easily restore  to a new Qubes system. But browsing those backups and extracting  information from a *normal*  computer may not be so simple. Qubes specifies a particular archive  software (available through most distro repositories) to accomplish  this, but I have never done it.\n\nThere’s  also a conceptual lockin. Going back to a normal distro is kind of like  reemerging on Flatland after a period in 3D. Gone is the separation of  activities, no comforting security wall of virtualization, nothing. You  open your password manager in a normal distro and it is on *exactly the same* system as your webbrowser - it makes you pause and think, 'is this safe?'. Indeed, was normal computing *ever* safe?\n\n**Nothing here is enough to make me quite Qubes.**\n\nI’d  say if you are going to try Qubes, use a system that has more than 16GB  RAM. It would be a mistake to not have a ‘normal’ computer around as a  just-in-case.\n\nQubes is great, and  reasonably secure, but all too often I find it inversely proportional to  anything remotely resembling convenience. Perhaps these gripes can be  viewed as the 'price of entry' to that security. That's your choice to  make, but make sure its an informed choice.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/z838lq/a_solution_to_the_csd_controversy/",
        "text": "For anyone who's unaware, CSD refers to \"Client-Side Decoration\", such as GTK headerbars. I have an idea for a specification that apps could use to describe a layout of widgets (butons, sliders, checkboxes, menus, etc) to the window manager/compositor, which could then draw it on the titlebar of the app. This combines the benifits of both CSD and no-CSD, but most importantly it makes everyone happy.\n\nOriginally, I went to the XDG mailing list and asked them if it could become a spec, and gave some examples of how it could benifit a couple of desktop environments I mentioned. Basially all the told me is that \"GNOME probably won't add support for that\" and \"GTK headerbars won't work with that design\". After a bit of arguing I basically said \"Ok, then it can still benifit other desktop environments\", and then they just stopped responding. I clicked on some of the respondents GitLab accounts, and they all were GNOME developers who managed XDG as a side-job. That's when I realized that, like GTK, XDG no longer cared about adding features that don't directly benifit GNOME. It also explains Wayland's lack of native support for things like external panels.\n\nAfter that I forgot about the idea for a couple of months, but now I'm hoping that I could use this post as a sort of petition, and ask individual window managers if they would like to implement this one by one. I'll try to help with development as much as possible. First I'll ask smaller, independant projects like Openbox or Enlightenment, and then I'll try using their support to encourage larger projects like XFWM and Marco, and hopefully eventually KWM and Mutter. The current design has the following wigdets:\n\n* Spacer - Empty space for separating widgets.\n* Separator - A vertical bar for separating widgets.\n* Label - just text. Could optionally be **bold**, *italic*, underlined, ~~strikethgough~~.\n* Icon - An icon. Could be formed from a file, icon theme icon, or character/emoji.\n* Button - A button, with a label and optionally an icon, Can also be a toggle button, where 1 click for *on* and another for *off*.\n* IconButton - A button with only an icon. It will look like the maximize/minimize/close icons on the window manager/compositor.\n* TextInput - A text input, where you write text. Could be configured to only show dots (a password input), or to only allow numbers, dates, times, colors, and many other things.\n* Slider - A slider. Customizable min/max values, and can be configured to have dashes (aka \"stops\" or \"markers\"), to mark significant points on the slider.\n* ComboBox - A list of options where you can choose one. Also known as a dropdown.\n* Menu - Internally a list of buttons, but will appear as a menu on a menubar.\n* ButtonGroup - A group of buttons with no space in between. Good for tabs, or similar actions (like undo/redo)\n* Stack - Contains multiple groups of widgets, where only one can be shown at a time. Similar to the center of a wizard app with the \"next/back\" buttons for choosing the group of widgets to show.\n* Scrollview - Stores widgets inside it, where the user can scroll left/right to see other ones.\n\nAside from properties special to each widget, each one will have three common properties:\n\n* width - The width of the widget in pixels\n* raw - Data stored by the window manager/compositor, which lays outside of the specification. Useful because, for example, GTK window managers like Mutter and Marco could store a GtkButton object here, and the app could change button properties specific to GTK (like \"highlighted\" blue buttons or \"dangerous\" red buttons). The code would basically say `if wm_name == \"Mutter\" or \"Marco\": mySpecialBtn.raw.isHighlighted = true`. That isn't real code, but you get the idea.\n\nAnything that isn't in the specification is up to the wm/compositor. For example, separators could be dashed, hidden, or even just a dot.\n\nThe way it will work is that there will be a library called *libtbw* (Titlebar widgets). Window managers/compositors can tell the library to send it messages about everything apps say to draw, and apps could use the library to 1: Check if the current wm/compositor supports toolbar widgets 2: If it does, draw stuff without having to worry about the current one 3: Or get the name of the current one to use special \"raw\" powers.\n\nIf anyone wants to see the source for the old one, here it is, but note that it's a bit out of date and I'm planning on making big changes before asking projects if they would like the idea. The .c file will be completely rewritten later so just ignore it. The .h file is here: [https://github.com/sammonius/TbWidgets/blob/main/tbwidgets.h](https://github.com/sammonius/TbWidgets/blob/main/tbwidgets.h). Here's a link to the GitLab issue I created asking XDG about this: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-specs/-/issues/95](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-specs/-/issues/95).\n\nI'd love to hear what everyone thinks about this idea.",

        "text": "So I recently saw what to me was a new phone producer. [https://no.nothing.tech/](https://no.nothing.tech/) \n\nThe Nothing Company producing the Nothing Phone using the Nothing OS. A whole lot of Nothing if you ask me. But puns aside, the company claims that Nothing OS \"... delivers only the best of Android. No bloatware. Just speed and smooth experience. Hardware and software speak a single visual language, with bespoke widgets, fonts, sounds and wallpapers. Enables seamless integration with third party products.\" There are a bunch of other claims for integration and single pane of glass like solutions (example given direct Tesla (red flag 1) integration without additional apps) speed being a priority etc. etc. But also worryingly, they seem to be catering to the NFTbros by offering an NFT gallery, red flag 2.\n\nOn the face of it, I'm all for someone forking android and removing bloat while creating specifically dedicated hardware for the OS to run on. But I'm getting this irked feeling that they're replacing a form of bloatware with another by catering to NFTs. Additionally that wholly spirals into another issue, where nothing good or ethical has ever come out of anything associated in any way with NFTs, I'm almost expecting some sort of long con rug-pull where you buy the phone and suddenly you're left with an LED besparkled lump plastic with a snapdragon core and a dead OS.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone has  had any experience with Nothing. Anyone know anything about the company or the software and how legit it is? What are the odds they go down konami's way and sell off their company's valued products after the C-levels have invested heavily into the NFT scam and need to recoup loses?\n\nI was sort of excited to see a standard android competitor with a phone in store for purchase (quite reasonably priced at that) with an interesting though vain concept of the back cover glyphs, but after seeing these additional things on their website I've gotten a sour taste in my mouth.

My laptop is an Acer Swift 3 with:\n\n- Intel i7-1065G7\n- 16Gb DDR4 \n- Nvidia MX350\n- 512Gb SSD\n\nIt's running Linux (Pop_OS!), and it's working fine, but for some reasson it won't work with the Razer Core X. The Razer Core X has a GTX 1050 Ti in it, and when I run \"lspci | grep VGA\", the GTX 1050 Ti shows up. However, I can't seem to connect it to anything (My monitor doesn't even detect that something is plugged into it). What should I do?",
