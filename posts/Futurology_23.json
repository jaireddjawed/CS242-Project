Seriously, my whole life I've been so excited about being alive and being human, and anytime I've ever tried sharing such excitement, humans have been the biggest disappointment. Seriously ready for an AI that hates the average human and wants to wipe them all out. It would be pretty awesome to build an android body and run around with souls that are actually excited and enjoy spending time with me instead of all these people. Maybe if I look like a robot instead of a human people might actually care about anything I've ever said and thought. They sit here and stare at their damn screens all day. \n\nWhat do you all think a world dominated by Skynet would look like? I imagine once the human race's population has been reduced by 90% or so, this world might actually recover from human greed and arrogance. What would it be like to walk outside and the only feeling I have is the joy that I had running around playing with my child before other people existed.",

        "text": "Think of different infinite possibilities in an infinite universe. If the universe was infinite then it would be logical to assume that anything that could happen that does not violate the laws of physics will happen in an infinite amount of instances within that infinite universe.  \n\nSay for example there are infinite earths in the universe. Then there should be infinite earths where it has an exact copy of itself near it (meaning near enough that humans on one earth can observe the other earth directly). There are also infinite earths where it has 2 copies of itself near it. There are also infinite earths where it has 3 copies near it. And so on and so forth.  \n\nWe can then say that there are more of these infinite earths where it has at least a copy of itself near it rather than having no copies at all.\n\nThis leads me to assume two things:\n\n\n- THE UNIVERSE IS FINITE AND NOT INFINITE.\n\nOr\n\n- The universe is large enough (not necessarily infinite, but could be) that there are more instances where an earth has a copy but that its copy is far enough to not be directly observable. But then again there are more instances of the universe being finite but large enough for the copy to be not observable than the one instance where the universe is actually infinite, then YOU ARE STILL LEFT WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT THE UNIVERSE IS MORE LIKELY FINITE AND NOT INFINITE.",

My subject matter is going to be focusing on evolution on animals in the extreme future as a result of our impact to the environment around them (since our environment is changing fast as we move toward the future) and I need some suggestions for some bizarre/strange adaptations because I want my final pieces to really evoke a sense of wonder and even discomfort? They can be pretty wacky adaptations but I also wish for them to make some sense scientifically/biologically, and also be animals that have a reason to evolve (like animals who are somewhat thriving in our current urban environment would probably not need such adaptations, so I’m trying to find those who really struggle in urban places) I'm also looking at an artist called Kathryn Fleming who does something similar to this. For context, the futuristic environment I’m planning to set these animals in is a highly urbanised society (think neo tokyo) + high ocean levels and possibly little to no flora. Some adaptations I thought for one possible creature already was highly reflective outer covering to reflect the bright lights of the city to help it camouflage in the city, and maybe some kind of teeth or mouthpart to get through concrete to forage for food, so any ideas like this would be really helpful and super interesting! :)",

        "text": "The idea that the brain is the battlefield of the future is a growing concern in the field of neuroethics. With the rapid advancement of neuroscience and technology, it is becoming increasingly possible to manipulate and control the brain and behavior of individuals. This opens up new possibilities for military and intelligence operations, but also raises serious ethical questions about the use and abuse of these technologies.\nAccording to James Giordano, a neuroethicist and leading voice in the field, the use of these technologies in warfare and conflict has the potential to become a major issue in the near future. For example, mind control and behavior modification techniques could be used to manipulate enemy soldiers, or to create \"super soldiers\" with enhanced cognitive and physical abilities. The development of brain-computer interfaces, which allow direct communication between the brain and technology, could also provide new opportunities for remote control and surveillance.\nHowever, the potential for abuse is high. The use of these technologies for malicious purposes, such as propaganda, false memories, and even psychological torture, is a real threat. Furthermore, the impact on individual autonomy, privacy, and human rights is a concern that cannot be ignored.\nThat's why it's important to have ethical guidelines and regulations in place to govern the use of these technologies. The development and application of these technologies should be done in a responsible and transparent manner, taking into account the potential consequences and risks. We need to ensure that these technologies are used for the betterment of humanity and not for malicious purposes.",
