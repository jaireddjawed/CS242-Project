Sometimes they expose ironies in how things work like certain human behaviours (like empowering individuality when humans are a social species, or empowering chastity when sex is a major of reproductive success, therefore a means of keeping the genes passing throughout other generations).\n\nSometimes this information can also be very dark and hard to swallow, especially if it involves things that some people hold dearly like a personal passion or sentimental value towards a certain country or society or even philosophy. Sometimes this information can really test what we value and what we believe in when we come into contact with new or unexpected information or controversial information.\n\nAnd becuase of the endless exposure to tons of different kinds of information becuase of the internet and other media that we have access to in the information era, whether it is good or bad information, this may also severely affect on how the person sees the world (although not everyone may think the same becuase some people may even look for information that will confirm their already internalized biases)\n\nThis large access of information can affect humans in a number of ways - how they view the world (And also how the media makes the information appear in a certain manner like sensationalism of the news), how they view themselves, how they view their beliefs and other beliefs and so on.\n\nIt can be pretty tricky  or maybe even terrifying to want to stay focused and sure of what you wish to pursue in or what you wish to identify yourself as and for that, this may make a person easily confused of what they want or what they wish to focus on or how they will live their day to day lives ",

        "text": "So in many aspects, selfishness is frowned upon and judging by history where most of it involves wars or conflict of some kind, you can get a feeling that there is a degree of selfishness involved to what to compete or go to war instead of being co-operative much like most of the world of today often wants to prioritise on co-operation and collaboration (like the EU, the UN, NATO, globalisation and so on) instead of conflict (with some exceptions)\n\nIt has also been proven that co-operation and empathy are [useful tools for co-operation during social dilemmas](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.659) and [prosocial behaviours also have evolutionary benefits](http://socialinteractionlab.psych.umn.edu/sites/g/files/pua1356/f/2010/2010/Simpson%20%26%20Beckes%20(Prosocial%20chapter,%202010).pdf)\n\nHowever, some philosophers do not see selfishness as a vile or a immoral emotion or thought. In fact, some actually see it as beneficial, both personally and even socially. \n\nTwo philosophers come to mind - \n\n- Friedrich Nietzsche and his Will to Power philosophy (basically means that using your inner drive or inner will to make you one step closer to what you desire or want, even though he also claimed that life is sufferring but that sufferring also gave life a purpose. There is that impulsive nature that human possess, what Nietzsche called it the Dionysian side, that makes humans more assertive), \n\n- and also Bernard Mandeville with his book \"The Fable of the Bees\" or \" Private Vices, Public Benefits\" (where he claimed that while personal vices or personal interests where regarded as immoral or \"sinful\" in religious ideals like Christianity, where he describes a hive of bees copying everything that humans do which made the bees selfish and desired only themselves. This ironically gave a lot of public benefit like material goods)\n\nOf course, nothing is either-or in the world and not even this subject. Some vices caused a lot of destruction like war, famine or even genocide like the Holocaust but ironically, there provided a lot of benefit like the Roman Empire managed to florish in the Mediterranean, or the event of WW2 eventually made the world more aware of the potential destructiveness of fascism and modern warfare and eventually created the UN.\n\n",

        "text": "EDIT - Being open-minded does not necessarily mean to be gullible and believe everything. Even if you are exposed to a lot of information that you are not used to, that does not mean that you cannot or should not think critically about that said information or examine thoroughly\n\nBecause of the information era of today, we are exposed to an over-abundance of information which makes not only aware to a lot of information and perspective that we were not previously aware of or given that much detail but also allows us to view a variety of different points of view as well, making us more aware that many subjects are not as straight-forward as we might think. Sometimes this extra amount of detail helps us gain more information to be able to think more critically about a certain phenomenon\n\nSometimes this open-mindedness also allows us to become more aware of ourselves as well, hence, we become more aware of our own habits, behaviours, and ideals that we may have never even realised or gone into depth before.\n\nBut because of this over-abundance of information and different points of view, I sometimes think when it is the right choice to think, observe and listen and to be more considerate or thoughtful vs when it is the right time to make a stand or make a decision or even to block any other kind of information from interferring with your train of thought. (what Eastern philosophies call \"monkey minds\" meaning that your mind is often restless, undecisive and so on which is why practicing mindfulness or meditation is necessary to practice psychological and even biological focus to channel all your attention to the specific goal that is in front of you and use whatever assert that supplements that focus and resist or avoid any other factor or stimulus that distracts or hinders that focus like other thoughts or maybe other desires (like going on social media) and learn to plan, prioritise and so on)\n\nLike I mentioned in another post regarding whether ignorance is a good thing, I sometimes wonder about this sometimes.\n\nIf you plan to be so open-minded about many things, then is it possible that this will eventually make you more uncertain on what *you* want to live by or what philosophies and ideals you wish to follow and progress in?\n\nIf you are a leader or a manager and have listened to every single point of view of your citizens or your collagues, even if some of them have similar needs, there are often a wide variety of different points of view that whatever choice you make, someone will be pissed off or does not get what they desired.\n\nI get that being open-minded is necessary especially that everyone continues to learn about a variety of different things throughout their entire lives. But there is also the sentence that too much of a good thing is still a bad thing",
