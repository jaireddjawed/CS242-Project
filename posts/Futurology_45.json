        "text": "INTRO\n\nI don't think I have all the answers. Maybe I have just this one. But we're living in such an interesting time for creation and publishing. I believe that it's necessary to provide context for one's arguments, so here goes.\n\nI'm a writer/publisher who creates roleplaying games. Sometimes I work for companies as a freelance writer. I also like teaching myself to draw. I'd say that I'm moderately skilled at sketching (enough to make my middle school students think I'm cool!) but I'm not a professional artist and I don't aspire to be.\n\nI consider myself a writer and a publisher first and foremost. I hire pros for commissions in my work, and I buy stock from my favorite artists, too. I also support multiple artists on Patreon. I love AI art. It's so much fun to dink around. It gives me models on which to base my own drawings (such as \"Batman villains in the style of Winsor McCay\"). \n\nI do use AI for professional purposes. Since I'm the sole breadwinner for my family and I work a day job, I can't afford to wait on the workflow for hiring an artist most of the time. I started Using AI in my work about four months ago, and it's made a difference in my life. I'm now able to supplement my family's income in a way that I haven't (regularly) in 11 years of working in the RPG industry.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nAI-generated art is being denied copyright protection. A big part of this reason is that if it was given protection then \"art farms\" could just create and submit image after image in order to monopolize creativity. We've seen similar things with patent trolls.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nHere's what I propose. AI gets copyright protection, BUT content creators have to pay on a sliding scale for registration, based on how many items they've submitted in the past 365 days. I imagine that a webcomic artist who creates something every day should be allowed to claim protection, and that costs should be reasonable. So the cost starts going up DRAMATICALLY after 365. \n\nCorporations get charged based on their ownership status. So if you're a division of Disney, or a subsidiary very far down the line, you're still paying 10 to 100 times more than Joe Blow who makes a few things a year.\n\nCopyright only gets extended to individuals or corporations who have their proper permits. \n\nBasically the idea is that it keeps things cheap for the little guys, allows the big boys to pay a bit more (they can afford it and I really don't care about their bottom line) and then it would prevent bad actors (typically small or mid-size firms plus lone trolls) from being able to afford to spam in the first place.",

        "text": "when talking about simulation hypothesis a lot of people including me seem to get the idea of us making conscious simulations in the future maybe indistinguishable from reality, but that doesn't mean that we are also a simulation of a higher level of reality. This is both due to the fact that we don't even know if there is something beyond the big bang and maybe we will never know so using occams razor we can't believe something like this and also because it just feels weird. If we are simulation what does this even mean, do we actually exist and if not what does it mean to really exist.\nSo my question is can someone believe that we will create simulation and at the same time that we are not simulated?",
