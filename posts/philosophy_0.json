Although only the present is observed, the present is happening at 10−⁴⁴ frames per second but on our brains timescale we process it at around 60fps every 0.01ms, the source of the energy that goes into time comes from the holograms various intertwining dimensions.\nSpace = Oscillations with set rules applied to them that they obey within the plank limits. Oscillations that exceed those limits become infinite and enter the absolute or afterlife which doesn't exist within the constructs of space/time (being a higher dimension) and space is made of a web like construct and this web is known as:\n Indras net; Which is composed of a shell of movement and at the core of its movement there is an unmoving point, and this point is made of the places between the flow of time and space, it also is the source of reality itself. That's why the energy being put into reality would appear to us as a web of pure movement, and cause of that immense energy from those confined waves, it may even be the source of virtual particles. It is comprised of nothing, but it starts to put elemental particles into perspective, which are still much larger than these grids that make up this universal hologram.\n● Brains computer like function = In computers the memory and SSD are linked to DRAM and DRAM is what appears on a monitor basically, but also the DRAM cannot hold much information but it can process at 17 nanoseconds and one nanosecond is 10-⁹ seconds; and for us, we'd perceive that as our alert consciousness, which is comparative to DRAM or left brain logical thinking. So that's why when you ask someone something they aren't currently thinking about, they may have to take a moment to try and remember it in order to say something about it known as loading on computers.\n In humans we have more processes attached to our DRAM, it's what I call DNA mode where the body is able to function just on the subconscious mind as well the cells of the body are in control of the body not the consciousness or DRAM of the brain. \nAll we are is left brain thinking consciousness, it's like a program that is a self aware process that creates its own holograms or thoughts; which thought stems from memory and memory is what makes up your identity and the conscious mind can make the subconscious mind change its perspective, a personality or \"their character\" is a perspective because it's all wrapped around what the subconscious mind interprets.\nThe human mind is also a hologram that attunes itself to the universal hologram by the medium of energy exchange, thereby deducing meaning and achieving the state that we call consciousness. As energy passes through various aspects of the universal hologram and is perceived by the electrostatic fields which comprise the human mind, the holographic images being conveyed are projected upon those electrostatic fields of the mind and are perceived or understood to the extent that the electrostatic field is operating at a frequency and amplitude that can harmonize with and therefore \"read\" the energy carrier wave pattern passing through it.\nThe entire human being, brain, consciousness, and all is, like the universe which surrounds him, nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex system of energy fields. The so-called states of matter are actually variances in the state of energy, and human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in two opposite states: motion vs rest.\n•Awareness = An observing self is typically associated with God, but as I am looking at this from a pantheist perspective to me it's both God and a fundamental aspect of our reality. A watching self also, as it's known as, is what's behind our consciousness and is on the spiritual side of things. As I've come to understand it is truly nothing that is aware of itself somehow and by it being nothing it can be entirely Interconnected cause it doesn't actually exist; therefore a higher self can be witnessing your exact experience from your perspective because a higher self is truly nothing and this nothingness appears to go through every single dimension of the hologram, outside of the hologram their exists nothingness which is aware and its in a state of nirvana having no desire to do anything and just watches it all happen from all of the Interconnected experiences of reality but experiences it as an individual.\n\n\nSo basically, this is my explanation:\nIt's like a gigantic circle with oscillating energy grids between the Infinite grids which contain absolutely Infinite energy and power and it expands at a constant rate but it's a giant torus with Infinite energy so it's almost like that space is 100% full of energy so our universe would be more of a 2% full byproduct to that energy\n Which the energy comes from a laser like energy that blinks in signals but these signals are vast sacred geometries that get unfocused by a beam splitter into many many many sacred geometries of energy fields which at larger scales is what we call \"feeling real\" or \"being real\" or \"time\" it is just a mirage though, and even knowing this doesn't change things. Fear is the surface level of that energy, and we as humans will react in so many various ways to the different things that make us fear them; but under the surface of that which is making us fear it is still just a bunch of smaller quickly vibrating waves that move in sacred geometries and beyond that is nothingness. Therefore, it is entirely possible that nothingness created powerful laser like waves, and those waves could become what we know as existence.\nThe dmt realm, absolute, or heaven that torus is infinitely full and isn't bound by scale, or time cause it's more like it's like matter vs liquid in their densities by what I have come to understand; and the much higher constantly expanding infinitely peaceful and loving places, their grids of geometries flow like gas and their so immensely powerful but in order to go past that point you need to be going faster and further than that to pass it as to leave reality into the great non dual space. \n\n\nSources: \n\nThe Gateway Project Document 2003\n1.

        "text": "Seeking Long Term Role Play partner\n\n\nF4M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI am a twenty six year old female from the United Kingdom who’s looking to get back into the world of roleplaying. I have around six years of experience in the field. I have done everything from  the simple “Slice Of Life” scenarios, I have dabbled in “fandom” role-plays but that is my weakest category. \n\nNow I am looking to get into more dark, story driven fantasy role-plays with dark themes. I already have roles and scenarios ready to go but I am open to suggestions and alterations. \n\nWhat I would expect from a potential role-play partner is this, not make the story all smut based, I don’t expect paragraphs upon paragraphs of detail or dialog all I want is enough of both to keep the role-playing going. I wouldn’t expect back and forth replies 24-7 all id like is maybe a couple of messages a day. \n\nI normally role-play on discord so we can have rooms and keep everything organised so that way if we do go a few days without playing we can always check back and see where we was and what the plot is.\n\nAlso I normally play in first person as that lets be get into character easier, plus if I play in third person I always seem to slip back into first person.\n\nI think I’ve covered everything but if I missed anything please feel free to drop me a message and ill respond as soon as possible.\n\n\nHere’s a taste of a few of the ideas I have got.\n\n\nDemon-Human Roleplay\n\n\nFor the setting I think its best if we set this in like fantasy medieval era if that’s okay?\n\n\nThe land of Rhurn has broken out into anarchy, after then passing of the last high king of Rhuru local Barons and Lords have all made attempts to grab as much land as possible, all of them vying to be the next High King of Rhuru. \n\nIn the midst of the chaos a cult know as “The Daughters of The Blood Moon” have been able to grow in strength and influence. Many of the peasants have turned away from their traditional gods and turned to the demonic side of beliefs. \n\n\nThe cult only wishes the bring order to an orderless world. A young lady who’s pure blood who has yet to be tainted by the chaos outside the guard of the cult is the one who’s blood will finally summon a great demon who will bring order to the world through conquest of the land using an army of the damned. \n\n\nLong term-Action-Adventure-Romance \n\n\n\n\nSpy lovers \n\n\n\nIts the Cold War, the USA and USSR are searching for anyway to get one up on the other by any means necessary but while that has been going on, in the shadows the Peoples Republic Of China have been building there strength and now they’re able to challenge America and Russian hegemony and be the undisputed number one global super power.\n\nThis leaves the CIA and KGB in a precarious place knowing the only way to stop the PRC is to team up.\n\n\nVintage Hollywood \n\nIt’s the late sixties early/ early seventies Hollywood is in its pure rock and roll vase.\n\nYou’d play a older married A list movie star and I’d be your lesser known forgiven costar who knows very little of the temptations that  Hollywood has to offer. Over the course of  our whirlwind and taboo romance both of our lives and careers will be changed forever.\n\n\nRed ridding hood- big bad wolf.\n\nIn the deepest depths of a misty forest lay a village surrounded by thick oak walls, but this forest was also home to ancient race of animal. Not much was known about them, some believed they were nothing more than simple wolves, others than they were once human who sold their souls to the devil in return for sheer power,strength and speed. \n\nBut one believed they were the guardians and protectors of the forest. \n\nThe vast majority of their kind had been hunted to near extinction, it wasn’t known how many were left but one thing for sure is the alpha of the pack was still alive and that’s all that was needed to take back the forest and for the wolf to take his rightful place as king of the wood. \n\n\nVampire King-Human Princess \n\n Humankind and vampirekind have been locked in a never ending war, the perpetual circle of violence has last close to three centuries. Both population counts are plummeting, the human birth rate has failed to keep up with the amount of deaths inflicted by the vampires and vampires haven’t been able to turn any human they’ve attempt to turn in many years. \n\nThe high king and the heir to his throne invite the vampire king to attempt to reach a peace settlement but upon seeing the kings daughter the vampire king has now found the queen he has been looking for, and he’ll have her by any means necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\n\nZara",
