There are:\n\n* 7 resistors (6@ 1/8 W ; 1 @ 1W),\n* 8 capacitors,\n* 4 LEDs (SMD),\n* 1 FET (1W),\n* 1 Op Amp,\n* 1-2 Voltage Regulator, and\n* 3 connector headers (male pin side).\n\nI'm wondering what form factor I should get for manufacturability.  There is no high speed switching (max ~40kHz from Op Amp).\n\nWhat is the most manufacturing friendly and cost effective form factor for components?  Not accounting for power ratings.\n\nWhat is a SMD worker/machines ideal size of component?  Has the least rework, failed solder joints, etc.\n\nRegards,\n\nLifesGambit ",

But my current job doesn't have me doing a whole lot of that kind of thing. I'm in the mood to practice these skills to keep them sharp, and I'm interested in learning about options for developing microcontroller and FPGA applications on my own time.\n\nWith that established, what sort of boards should I look into purchasing? I guess I'd like to get one of those boards that comes with both a microcontroller and an FPGA, but I'm not sure how those would end up working. Can the two devices be programmed independently, or would it be the case that, for example, the microcontroller can't be reprogrammed and can only be used to configure the FPGA or something? I'm a little embarrassed to admit that, while I'm decent at embedded design, and *very* good at HDL, I'm not all that experienced at using both together.\n\nAlso, I have no idea what sort of project ideas to try out. I'm not interested in simplistic stuff like LED patterns or gathering data from a sensor. I want to do something badass. I've written a simulation model for a computer processor in a class once, and I'm wondering if I can do something like that and implement it in the FPGA, and then develop a simplistic OS. Can I find FPGA boards with chunky quantities of RAM and external storage?\n\nI don't know. What kind of applications would I be capable of developing using a home user's kit?",

Of course I started using Arduino a couple years ago and made some projects on it, but eventually i found it to be... \"too easy\"? Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely no expert, I just feel that the whole arduino environment isn't going to be that helpful if i ever get into embedded systems or firmware development.  \n\nSo i thought of getting another MCU to dive deep into it and i found the Nordic Semiconductor's NRF51822, which even has Bluetooth Low Energy (I love low energy battery powered stuff, my end-goal project would be to build some sort of smartwatch). I got the development kit which also includes a Segger J-link OB which may become helpful to know about the J-link tools. Also it has nice documentation and community. Seemed perfect.\n\nHere's the thing, this is overwhelming me! I mean yes, i can flash the examples and they work fine but getting something new on my own? Everytime i try to figure how stuff works, new stuff appears. Like an endless Matryoshka. Am i supposed to get how everything works? Im still struggling on eclipse integration with the toolchain and makefiles. I went the armgcc way instead of Keil since im familiar with gcc and want to get better at linux too. \n\nDo you guys have any advice? Should i keep tinkering or maybe get a book? Do you recommend any? \n\nPD: I have basic C understanding from my \"Algorithms &amp; Programming 1\" class, so the C part isn't that problematic but i have no assembly knowledge yet (I guess debugging tools aren't gonna be helpful).

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have a question about quantization noise in an ADC, and more specifically about something we call the \"process gain\". Please correct me if I'm wrong somewhere, but I will write it down as I understand it.\n\nWhen we make the assumption that quantization noise is uniformly distributed between -LSB/2 and +LSB/2, we can calculate its RMS and arrive at a value:\n\n**RMSnoise = q/sqrt(12)** where q = 1 LSB amplitude.\n\nThe RMS value of a full scale sine wave w.r.t. q is then:\n\n**RMSsine = (q*2^(N))/(2*sqrt(2))** with N nr of bits.\n\nExpressing the SNR, RMSsine/RMSnoise, in dB gives us the well known formula:\n\n**SNR = 6dB*N + 1.76** This is something I understand where it comes from.\n\nWhen taking an FFT of your signal though, and trying to model your quantization noise w.r.t. the signal you're measuring, you want to look at the noise level in 1 FFT bin. In many cases quantization noise can be regarded as white noise, and so you can simply divide the power of your quantization noise (which we already have computed) by M/2 because the noise will be spread over half the amount of FFTbins. (M = #of bins)\n\nNow, what I don't understand is the following. The formula is:\n\nSNR = 6dB N + 1.76 + **10log10(M/2)**.\n\nWhy is the bold part, called the process gain, using 10*log instead of 20*log in its dB calculation? We have been talking about RMS voltages during this whole calculation and not about power. Why are we suddenly using 10*log like in power calculation?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nP.S. I followed [this link](http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/tutorials/MT-001.pdf)  in my reasoning and used the same names.",

Below is a quick list of what I was considering:\n\nEquipment:\n\nPSUs\n\nMeters\n\nUSB Oscilloscope\n\n\nPassive Components:\n\nResistor Kits (looking at 96 value 1% resistor kits by Yageo for the different ranges.  Only gives me 5 of each but it does give me all the values.  Open to other suggestions if other people have them)\n\nCapacitor Kits (haven't looked too far into this but I'm not sure if I need any big kits.  Mainly just some standard value tantalums and ceramic cap kits?)\n\nDiode kits/Zener kits (if those exist as well.  Might just pick a handful of them)\n\nTransistors (open to suggestions here. Not looking to do a bunch of solid state circuitry, I'll likely just use them for switching circuits with microcontrollers)\n\nFETs (IRFD9120, IRFD120's, unless someone else has better suggestions)\n\nLEDs (for diagnostics/funsies)\n\nTrimpots\n\n\nIC's (this is where I could really use the advice):\n\nDC/DC converters\n\nVariable supply ICs (ie LP2951)\n\nVarious MUXes (SPDT, 4:1, 8:1, etc)\n\n555 Timers\n\nVarious op amps (I'll probably handpick these)\n\nDigital chips (AND/OR, etc)\n\nInstrumentation Amps (probably handpick these as well)\n\n\nI'm likely not going to to order any microcontrollers as I have a ton of development kits with various companies.  \n\nNot sure if I should order any transceivers at this point.  Considering buying some headers and housings for easy cable applications.  \n\nOverall, that's all I have off the top of the head.  If you have any additional suggestions, things I might have missed, things you would add to your personal lab equipment, let me know.  \n\nThanks a lot, everyone!",

But after reading many review of people who say that it is to expensive, and it is the most expensive of all raspberries I started to doubt my decisions . Is it idiotic to implement a compute module to a product in 2018? Should I just buy a raspberry pi 3 and build a breakout board for it?

Would you say that experience in Matlab and its toolboxes or Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) (A data-science based package library) is more useful wherever you work? I understand that Matlab is kinda pricey and that not everyone uses it because of that, but at the same time, things like Solidworks and other programs are even more expensive, so depending on the company Matlab can cost pennies in a project's budget. Python is just a general programming language so it has uses outside of the scientific realm, but also has to rely on community created packages which depending on your stance, may be a good or a bad thing.\n\nI've already taken the bog standard engineering Matlab classes at my college and thought it was okay at best and I have some previous experience in Python from a high school programming course and some personal scripts I've written, but nothing high level enough to compare to Matlab's use. I also figured that yeah I probably should just get proficient at both of them, and I expect to anyways, but I'd still like to devote more time into one of the two to get better at it.",

        "text": "So, I have been studying circuits, and I seem to be a bit confused about voltage.\n\nMy teacher described it as a water pump pushing water through a system of pipes where pipes of smaller cross-sectional areas represent resistors. So, if I am analyzing a circuit and using Ohm's Law, I would ask myself \"how much of a push would move this much water across a pipe with this diameter?\" So, I understand this analogy.\n\nHowever, voltage is also described as the \"difference in potential energy per unit charge between two points\" or \"the work done by a unit charge.\" This is where I get a bit confused. I thought that in physics, work was defined as energy transfer and force applied across a distance (W = Fd). So, is the term \"work\" being used in the same context here? If so, is it the same formula, and why is distance involved? I thought that at the same node, voltage is the same, so if we have a longer wire, that should not change the voltage across it, so where does distance come into play? \n\nFurthermore, how would I go about thinking about the voltage drop across a resistor? Would I ask something along the lines of \"there is x amount of potential energy per unit charge at this point, and the charges hit the atoms of the resistor and give off some of their potential energy as other forms of energy in the resistor (heat), thus causing the lower potential energy per unit charge at the other end of the resistor (voltage drop)\"? Is my thinking of how the charges do \"work\" on the resistor correct, or am I analyzing it incorrectly? If it is correct, why is saying that a voltage difference pushes current across a resistor the same as saying that the charges transfer some of their energy to the resistor's atoms when one is trying to understand why there is a voltage DIFFERENCE between the two terminals of the resistor?\n\nLastly, which way of thinking about voltage should I use? Should I use the \"voltage = pressure pushing current\" analogy or \"voltage is how much work the charges can do on the circuit\" way of thinking?",

In the case of the circuit above, the whole point is for the \"negative\" side of the capacitors to become positive and activate the transistors. Is it just a mistake in these diagrams? I've noticed similar things in some Forrest Mims books, which is why I ask instead of automatically assuming it's a mistake. \n\nEDIT 2:\nThank you all so much for your answers! \n\nSo. To summarize what I've learned and ask a few more questions (will post in OP as well) :\n\n1. The capacitor is never actually connected backwards, because (in the case of C1) the right plate is always at a lower potential than the left, regardless of the direction the current is flowing at the time.\n\n2. If I'm understanding correctly, the right plate of C1 will get briefly pulled to a negative potential when the left plate gets pulled to almost-ground by Q1 activating (maintaining the potential difference between them).\n\n3. At this point, C1 begins to charge/discharge (its plates begin to equalize in voltage, but I could see either word being used). For a BRIEF second, the left plate remains at ground while the right plate hits 0.6V (at this point the capacitor really is connected in reverse, but its for an extremely brief period of time)...at which point, of course Q2 activates and the whole cycle repeats.\n\nAnything I'm still misunderstanding? Thanks so much! (/u/ribond86 , /u/dmc_2930 , and /u/psycoee , you guys get a special shoutout). ",

I've worked with many ARM MCUs before, but have never dealt with these Blue Gecko modules before. I've spent the past week attempting to familiarize myself with the whole Blue Gecko ecosystem and the dev. board I purchased for these modules, and it suffices to say that there's very little documentation explaining how to develop for even the simplest of applications using these modules. They seem like very capable devices, but the whole ecosystem is extremely poorly documented.\n\nSiLabs' toolchain includes a few example projects for their various BLE demo applications, but none for showing how the use the actual peripherals on the MCU (GPIO, I2C, timers, etc.). The design I was provided with is essentially a slightly edited version of SiLabs' BLE thermometer examples code (only using a different sensor over the same I2C bus), so there isn't much useful code to work from with the existing design.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has past experiences using these SiLabs MCUs/SoCs such as the Blue Gecko, and if you could offer any guidance on the process for programming these modules, or share any tips on best practices when developing for these targets.",

        "text": "No idea why this concept hasn't been implemented in any product yet, but it appears there is a better (light efficient) alternative to LCD shutters or LCD displays although I am personally more interested with the former.\nThe alternative is PDLC which is already used in smart windows and smart glasses to scatter and block visibility of something.\nAdvantage over LCD is there are no polarizers needed so 50% and up light loss is not really an issue. The light goes through two ITO PET coated plastic films with a very thin PDLC (polymer-dispersed liquid crystal) and UV glue layer between them so light loss is only due to thin ITO layer and the plastics themselves.\nDownside with current smart mirrors is you need around 60V AC to run and the on/off state switching speed is relatively slow (60ms)\n\nThis paper ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3254347_Reduction_of_the_switching_time_of_polymer-dispersed_liquid_crystal_using_field_oriented_addressing )\ndiscusses a method of speeding up the switch speed up to 2.56ms which is enough to, say, use this material as alternative to 3d shutter glasses, any optical systems where 80% light transmittance is acceptable an a non-mechanical solution would be helpful or a color-sequential (ie. DLP) display.\n\nI've found a company which supplies this chemical mixture together with the glue for a resonable price of 400USD for 100g. 100g might not seem much but we are talking about nm thicknesses.\n\nI'm a little stuck with the above paper though. As I understand the ITO electrode structure on one of the ITO PETs should be something like this:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/L5izf43.png\n\nAccording to the paper:\n&gt;The ITO electrode is connected to the ground while\nsquare waves are applied to both finger electrodes. When the\nsquare waves have the same phase the electric field across the\nPDLC is vertical. When the square waves have a phase shift\nof 180\nthe electric field is horizontal. \n\n\nI'm a little confused why that arrangment will cause the electric field orientation change. Does anyone understand that part? Or maybe my diagram is an inaccurate inderstanding of their \"finger electrode\" idea?\n\nThe chemicals should arrive in 10 days but I'd like to understand what is actually going to be happening in my eperimental setup when I do get to the experimenting phase.\nWill share my results. Already have an inexpensive method of etching an ITO PET like that with off-the-shelf tools and HCl.",

To smooth the transitions across the time divided slots cyclic prefix waveforms are used to prevent Inter-Symbol Interference caused by having a discontinuous envelope in the time domain...",

        "text": "Looking for advice on internships for this summer for a junior EE.\n\nI have narrowed my offers down to two. One from a smallish aerospace company where I would work on signal processing algorithms for radar, image processing and other things for unmanned aircraft. The second is from a national lab (United States) where I would be working on writing electromagnetic and plasma physics simulation codes.\n\nI have worked on computational electromagnetics research for over a year now and enjoy it enough to consider pursuing a PhD in it or something related. This makes the national lab opportunity very enticing. On the other hand, The aerospace job is more of a typical engineering job (something I have not held yet) so the exposure would help me decide if jumping straight into a job after my BS is a good idea. The national lab would be more of a position to show me what a job after a PhD is like.\n\nLast to mention, the location of the aerospace job is really cool (San Diego), whereas the national lab is not as exciting (although still not a bad place). The financial package at the aerospace job is also very good and I haven't gotten official numbers form the lab yet.\n\nI am looking for thoughts and opinions on my options. What are some strengths and disadvantages of each option? What would you take? etc.",
