        "text": "Hey all, I recently moved in with my boyfriend. We've been together for 4 years. He is fairly frugal and so am I. However, we tend to disagree when it comes to grocery shopping. He thinks Target is the cheapest place to buy groceries in our area (yes I know he's crazy!). He usually buys the same things every time. He tries to mostly eat vegetarian but this means he buys those frozen meatless chicken tenders, meatballs, packaged meals etc. Which are just as expensive as real meat these days, and honestly they aren't that good. He also buys a lot of prepackaged things like boxed rice mixes and Mac and cheese. I can't get him to admit he does this because he doesn't know how to cook, or if he truly thinks it's cheaper. I like to cook. I'm not very good but I'm getting better at it and I enjoy doing it.  I'm trying to convince him we would actually save money if we went with more fresh produce instead of frozen crap. Also if he would get off his high horse about being brand specific about things and actually try other grocery stores I think we could probably cut our grocery bill in half. I just don't know how to approach a conversation about it. I've tried including him in the cooking process. I bought a vegetarian cookbook and had him pick out a recipe and we made it together. The entire time we were shopping for ingredients he was complaining about the prices.",

I know if I had booked much earlier I could get a flight for less than 200$ through regular flight booking. \n\nThe point of Express deals is to save money on flight ticket, the details of the flight are revealed only after booking is complete. One down side of this ticket is its non changeable and non refundable. so always keep this mind.\n\nAlthough Expedia has a similar thing called 'Expedia bargain Fair', with Priceline Express deal in most cases you can figure out the actual flight details before you  complete the booking. The way I did this is making use of google flight. So I just searched for flight on google flight for the same day and added select airline filter and sorted by price. You can see list of airline and original price on the Express deal. In my case I could find one flight on google flight that exactly matched this criteria. Even if there are multiple results with same price, you can figure out the flight using the approximate take off time show in the Express deal.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI know almost nothing about hearing aids. I asked the following in both r/hearingaids and r/audiology but both posts were deleted for whatever reason.\n\nAnyways, there are now $200 hearing aids at stores like Walmart, [Here's the story from a couple months ago](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/cheaper-hearing-aids-hit-stores-today-available-over-the-counter-for-first-time/) ---- [and the reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/y749nh/cheaper_hearing_aids_hit_stores_today_available/) which piqued my interest.\n\nMy Father has refused hearing aids for decades because he feels they would make him \"look old\", but he's also missed out on a lot in these past couple decades not being able to hear well, especially in public places (like restaurants).\n\nSo are these $200 hearing aids really worthwhile? Of course no ones wants to be 10 or 20 times and much, although I'm sure the expensive ones are much better. I think the first stop should probably be to an audiologist, but I assume they want to sell you their own expensive stuff, kind of like when you go to an optometrist and they want you to spend $300+ on their eyeglasses as opposed to buying prescription lenses online for $30.\n\nI would also consider cheaper hearing aids for myself, even though I'm only 37, I have a lot of difficulty understanding what people are saying (also mainly in public places), and since my Father (79) and slightly older Brother (41) suffer from substantial hearing loss, it seems to likely be a hereditary thing.\n\nI'm having trouble finding which are the exact $199 hearing aids on walmart referred to in the article/discussion links posted above, but they look like the fairly large kind that sit behind your ear, and then have the little attachment thingy that goes in your ear. I don't think my father would go for those as they stick out too much. I am also considered with appearance myself (being a young guy who wears hearing aids is not something I want to display to the world), but I'd also just rather be able to hear, because I know how much hearing loss can affect people's lives, they can miss out on *a lot*",

It‚Äôs a contract job and I have a year and a half left. I was working towards my goals and tried my best to move up in the job, but I had a mental breakdown and had to take a leave of absence.  \n\nThe job is stressful, toxic, and not paying me much. I make around $52K and the cost of living where I‚Äôm at has led me into debt. I literally have 77 cents in my name right now, until I get paid again. \n\nI‚Äôm about $10,000 total in debt and my credit is tanking, so I can‚Äôt take out any loans at the moment. \n\nI‚Äôm unable to really provide and take care of myself with what I‚Äôm making. \n\nDuring my time off, I tried my best to apply for jobs. I landed one that‚Äôs not far from home, which is across the country. And the pay would be significantly more. \n\nI would make 83K annually. It‚Äôs a bigger city and right now if I wasn‚Äôt in debt, I would be fine with the cost of living, \n\nHowever, it would mean I‚Äôd have to take break from some of my career goals, since it‚Äôs not necessarily in the same field I‚Äôve been working in. Also, this job isn‚Äôt going to help me  with moving expenses. I would have to do it all out of pocket. So this will be a big financial strain on me. My parents said I could take a loan out of my 401K, but I‚Äôm scared to do that. When I get back from my leave of absence , I can take a loan out, but if I leave the job, I‚Äôll be forced to pay that all back within a month or 2, which I think is impossible for me to do at the moment with how my finances are. \n\nI guess I just need some advice on what to do? Should I accept this job, with a large increase and try my best to get back on my feet, or should I try to wait it out at my current job. Is a 30K increase worth all of this? \n\nPart of me wants to move to a better paying job, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do when I can‚Äôt afford to move. \n\nThere is a possible silver lining. I know a job could be opening up within my company in a different city. If I could get that, relocating would be different. I know the company would a pay portion of the move possibly 2-3k . I'd get paid in between moving and if I take out of my 401K. , it would just be deducted from my paycheck, rather than me having to pay it all out if I leave. Again this is a possibility , but nothing is for sure. ",

These are really fun to make and use, and you can train balance as well as core strength.\n\nThe reason I made the balance board and a wobble board was because it turned out I have NO balance :-) The wobble board was too difficult in the beginning... but I am getting there. Practice makes perfect!\n\nHere are some directions: \n\n[https://fitnesstestlab.com/diy-wobble-board-faster-ankle-sprain-rehabilitation/](https://fitnesstestlab.com/diy-wobble-board-faster-ankle-sprain-rehabilitation/)\n\n[https://scoutlife.org/hobbies-projects/projects/151187/how-to-build-a-balance-board/](https://scoutlife.org/hobbies-projects/projects/151187/how-to-build-a-balance-board/)\n\nI had some pine plywood from a roofing project left, and also some deck screws and wood glue at home. All I needed to buy was a pine ball top for $ 3.97. You'll also need some tools, like a circular saw, a miter saw and a screwdriver.",

        "text": "So I was unexpectedly unemployed in late October. Fortunately I had planned ahead and I am not in horrible spot. My house is secure. My advice to any homeowner is to save top at least six months of mortgage and don't touch it. I have three small dogs and dedicated that we will all make the journey together. A friend gave me an old stand up freezer. I have gotten a truck load of wood chips for my backyard from chip[drop](https://drop.com). I raked in organic gardening lime to kill any bugs. That was a big job but the free truck load of wood chips was an immense bonus for me. I'm applying for jobs an d looking into self employed opportunities. \n\nI have been going to food banks to reduce expenditures. I have been given a lot of fruits/vegetables that are within a day of going bad. The canned foods have been very helpful but are a lot of beans. My frugal lifestyle mandates that I am responsible for not wasting what is given to me. I was given a 5 lbs bag of salad greens that were past fresh date so I dehydrated them and then will powder them. They are a bit bitter but Ithey are dog safe as a dog food additive. I can also use it in foods that need a bit of green and bitter in them. I have dehydrated a cantaloupe, watermelon, 5lbs of sweet potatoes and 10 lbs of carrots. These are all good, safe treats for the dogs. Last night I caramelized 10 lbs of onions and froze individual portions. Today I got an eggplant, tomato and red pepper that was a day way from going completely bad. I will dehydrate those into a spaghetti sauce mix for later use. I also froze 3 lbs of whole potatoes to use latter as a hash/mashed potato meal. Most of the fresh/prepared food I'm receiving is requiring some type of processing/preservation method. I have three food banks close by that I can access  on rotation. I answer all of their qualifying questions honestly. I am turning into a food saving expert. \n\nThe food bank today gave me 3 bags of dog food which is helpful. Tomorrow, I will reach out to organizations that specialize in helping with dog care during unexpected periods of unemployment. The dogs are enjoying going out on more walks and it's good for me too. \n\nAs far as heating my house, when I bought my fixer upper house 3 years ago I made into into separate portions which allows me to heat different areas separately. I got a couple of portable electric heaters from goodwill so I'm only heating the section I'm in. I'm in Phoenix AZ so the it's not gotten below 66 degrees during the day or below 45 degrees at night. Me and dogs snuggle at night, it doesn't drop below 65 degrees inside so I don't have to run heat/heaters at night. \n\nI've gotten health insurance through the market place for 2023 so that will be very affordable and help out immensely with my prescriptions and doctors visits. I had to eat a large payment to be insured by health care for December but I rather be out $300 rather than $300K in debt if I have a catastrophe health event. I have to face the fact that I'm middle aged and overweight, I could have a stroke or heart attack. Also, I could be walking my dogs and get hit by a drunk driver. Anything could happen and I want health insurance in place!\n\nI have spent the last 3 years planning for an unforeseen event and so far my frugal planning is paying off. My suggestion to all the frugal Nannettes/Nanos out there is to use the money save by being frugal as an insurance premium for unexpected catastrophic economic loss. My goal in making these posts is to let other frugal men/ women and everyone in between plan for unexpected unemployment and how to deal with it when it happens. Please use your frugality to  plan, plan and plan for an unexpected happening inn your life.",

I know this seems high by I think for someone who lives on there own, there are just a lot of inefficiencies that drive up food costs.\n\nI'm interested in lowering my monthly food spend to $360 CAD ($265 USD), a 35% reduction, by getting all my nutrition from a meal replacement shake, hol food, for the month. I've used it for lunches in the past and its very satiating and high protein.

So today I had an idea and checked if the plastic is food safe and it is! it's PP 5 - polypropylene.\n\nSo if you see someone eating spoonfuls of hair conditioner in public don't worry - it will just be me eating vanilla pudding from my new lunch box lol",

My question is, can I clip coupons from the app with my account and still use her number? Or does it all have to be connected? Not sure how it works.",
