        "text": "I genuinely cannot for the life of me fathom why some people stop a full car’s length away from the car in front and after about 5 seconds slowly creep up and fill the gap!! And they do this every time they stop!!!!\nThe reason why this is so infuriating is because it then makes everyone else in the lane behind them feel they need to drive forward 3 metres so *they* don’t look like the weirdo scared of back bumpers. Also think of the collective extra unnecessary pollution they just caused by making anything up to hundreds of other vehicles rev up their engines again.\n\nFuck it, there’s more…\n\nDrivers that take a full 5 seconds to get their car moving at a green light. No readiness or anticipation at all… they’ve even got the handbrake pulled up and everything. And because they were so slow, only 2 cars got through before the lights changed.\n\nPeople who don’t indicate. Ever. This one is getting worse day by day.\n\nPeople that park taking up multiple spaces in a situation when parking is already extremely limited. The urge to do something to your car is off the scale.\n\nDrivers that don’t understand zip filtering and blast their horn, gesticulate, or try to block the 2nd lane when it’s coming up to the bottleneck.\n\nPeople that drive in the middle lane for the entire journey on the motorway.\n\n——————\n\nI could write a book about the terrible driving on our roads. I’m sure you could too. Let’s hear your examples of shitty driving on UK roads!",

My village has had 2 road closures causing massive detours, some of the remaining open roads have still got pretty bad conditions for driving. People have been asking many questions for n the Facebook page about which routes are open and drivable \n\nI thought I’d be helpful and posted an early morning update for a road being partially flooded, containing icy patches, but it was passable with care. About an hour later there was apparently an accident involving 4 cars (I don’t think anyone was hurt), plus another car flipped over on its side on a completely different road. The local Facebook mums are now all blaming me for the accidents.",

        "text": "Where I live, charities send out donation bags around neighborhoods with a date within the week that someone will come round and collect if left outside your door/in view from the street. \n\nI had one come through the door a little before Christmas, to be collected on the following Thurs or whenever. Perfect, I had some things I'd been meaning to donate but never got round to and this will clear some space out for Christmas, nice. Ended up being around 2 small black bags worth of clothing, so put them outside and taped a note with \"X charity donation bag\" just incase they would only collect a marked bags. Popped it out the night before, noticed my neighbour had one out too. \n\nThe following day (unsure of time but still daylight) I went for a walk with the dogs, noticed mine had been lifted but not my neighbour's. Didn't think much of it and didn't notice if any other bags were on the street before we got into the open fields so it never crossed my mind again.\n\nUntill yesterday.\n\nHeading home from a trek with the dogs, I cut across the grass this time up the other end of the village, where there's a small carpark, blocks of new builds, further works going on expanding the village. The recent snow then sunny weather has left the ground covered in that crunchy slush footing so walking over grass was easier than the pavements. Cutting through the grass and trying to watch where I'm stepping I walk past what I thought was an old towel or something from one of the cars but I actually notice it's a band t-shirt. \n\nI recognise that shirt. I have that shirt. No. I donated it, i think. Did I? \n\nI get home and check and sure enough its one I chucked into the collection bag. Then I remember seeing my neighbours bag still sitting while mine was gone a few weeks back.\n\nThe area I saw the top is newly added on to the village in the last few years and while most of the people round there are pretty decent, there's some that are absolute schemeboats. Dog shit everywhere, ditry nappies and rubbish scattered all over the bin areas. I once saw a used fanny pad in the kids play area.\n\nI don't care that someone else has my clothes. I care that A) it was intended for charity B) a pretty decent shirt that someone could enjoy is now chucked in a carpark till probably when the council cut the grass in the spring C) I had bras there so now some fucking jakeball up the road knows the size of my tits.\n\nBest case scenario ; some absolute scaff has chanced their luck thinking they might find something worth selling and swiped it\n\nWorst case scenario ; some manky creep has seen me around, saw bags of clothes outside my house and is now sniffing my bras while wanking onto old jammy bottoms and jumpers untill one night I'm out walking alone, he follows me, knocks me out, kidnaps me and I become fodder for some shitty true crime podcast presented by someone with a really irritating voice.",
