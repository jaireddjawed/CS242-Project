Every time I look in the mirror, I can't help but be a little surprised to see someone looking back.\n\nI feel like my ADHD makes introspection nearly impossible. How am I supposed to when every ten seconds I'm thinking about something new? Even when I do realize profound things about myself, I forget it within hours if not sooner. I spend hours(cumulatively, of course) upon hours reflecting on my actions, my relationships, how I carry myself, and my experiences, yet this amounts to nothing once my mind wanders off to something more interesting for that sweet, sweet dopamine.\n\nHonestly, it makes me feel almost like a zombie, you know, one of the classic ones; not a rotting corpse but just a puppet. I don't feel like I'm really depressed, I get happy, sad, angry, but it's always in very short bursts that are quickly replaced. It makes me feel like my emotions are fake in a way, as if I'm just acting, but they're genuine. I imagine it looks weird when I get intensely frustrated and within the next few minutes I've moved on and the experience has left my consciousness entirely, just back to my default. \n\nI meet on the phone with a therapist for half an hour about once every week, but I almost never get past small talk about what I did over the last week. Combine my forgetfulness with a struggle to form my thoughts into words, and I feel like I'm wasting both of our time so much of the time. I especially struggle when she doesn't prompt me as well. I don't think it's entirely worthless, after all, it was how I was referred for testing in the first place.\n\nI'm hoping that when I go to see a psychiatrist, they'll prescribe me some meds and I'll see if I can really begin to learn about myself two decades into my life.\n\nThis'll probably get lost in the void, but at least I've got it off my chest to a few random internet strangers lol.",

Podcasts and audiobooks work well for me, but I’ve found that I don’t retain information as well that way, and it doesn’t exercise my vocabulary or literary sense. Lately I just feel really stupid. I talked to my doctor, and he suggested that I try some control methods for focus before we talk medication, but really nothing has worked. At this point, I’m thinking medication might be my best bet to manage myself. I’m a little scared of it, though. I’m worried my personality will change or I’ll become irritable or bland. A central part of my social life is my spontaneity. If I tell my doctor that I’d like to try medication, how will he know which one to prescribe? He’s my primary care doctor, and a smart guy, but his wheelhouse is bones and joints, not psychiatry. Would I be better off looking for another doctor before being prescribed? Will I have any say in what medication I’ll be prescribed with, and if so, is there anything I should know first?\nI’m sorry if my questions are all over the place, I’m new to all of this.",

        "text": "Historically, I have been pretty out of control when it comes to clothing shopping. I have tried gradually decreasing my spending, starting by restricting myself to $1000/month - which is obviously still WAY too much. I thought such a high limit would be easy but I repeatedly failed to stay within it. Now, I have found something that has reduced my spending to about $250 monthly on clothes.\n\nI simply gave myself a rule that I could only buy 1 article of clothing a month, period. I have actually stuck to it for 4 months straight now and I think I understand why this worked for me when other, less restrictive, solutions failed.\n\nMy brain naturally sees this rule as more of a game. What is the BEST possible article of clothing I can buy if I only get 1 article this month? It's a puzzle! Staying under $1000 dollars a month wasn't a game or a puzzle, it was just a boring old budget. I have used gamification to manage my ADHD in a lot of ways but I had not thought to apply it to my shopping issues until now. \n\nThis month I bought a silk, knee-length dress. I chose it because it is appropriate for work, would make a good wedding-guest dress, pairs well with a large portion of my existing clothes, is made of high-quality material, is well constructed, is machine washable, and will add to my summer wardrobe (despite having lots of clothes, I always seem to neglect to buy summer clothing). \n\nNow I consider so many factors and compare so many articles of clothing before picking one. Before applying this rule, I would buy things and barely think about it at all. This would often lead to more spending because I would buy something that didn't go with anything I had and feel like I had to buy more stuff to go with it.\n\nI am sure this rule wouldn't work for everyone. The big takeaway I see in this is: When it comes to solving a stubborn problem, experiment. You might stumble upon a solution that just clicks!",

        "text": "Hello, I’ve been on 30mg Vyvanse for more than a week now and I thought I’d ask this sub about rumination, especially relating to crushes.\n\nSo, when unmedicated I always had the issue of obsessively thinking about someone. The worst times were probably when I’d hyperfocus on someone for weeks/months, then toss them once I’m bored. Medication has helped quite a bit! I have my fun, I can more easily bring myself back to what I should be focusing on, etc. \n\nBUT, there’s this nagging feeling that I should be having more relief when it comes to rumination. \n\nI’m on vacation, doing all kinds of things, but I still sometimes start planning out stuff in my head, plans that are weeks away and… definitely don’t need planning anymore and at that moment. It seems like my mind craves this, perhaps an interaction with the person involved. The problem is that it still involves a crush of mine.\n\nTo add to this, in college I still don’t seem to be concerned about classes that much. I’m there mostly for socializing with said person, which eerily sounds like me unmedicated, but admittedly less intense. It seems like it’s my “fix”, that I might feel bummed out if don’t talk to a specific person during the day, and that I have to daydream about them briefly even if I’m on vacation doing things. \n\nNow I’m thinking, must I purge this mini-obsession, or is it normal? Why do I think about them multiple times a day, still? Sure, it won’t derail my attention as much as before and turn into an hour long thing, but why is it even happening in the first place? Why aren’t I in the “now”, I can just worry about this later and enjoy their company when the time comes?? I don’t think rumination has ever NOT sabotaged me when it comes to relationships!\n\nTo add to this, I did dislike my time with Concerta but I’ll admit that it helped this aspect quite a bit; maybe too much, to the point of emotional blunting. \n\nI’m also a bit worried of losing how “fun” I am if I go up a dose on Vyvanse. Would I start neglecting my friendships and relationships as soon as I get overly comfortable dopamine levels, a bit like on concerta? AKA, I’d stop socializing since it brings me little gratification. \n\nTo the medicated people, what’s the “normal” amount of rumination you should have? I suppose there’s no harm in trying 40mg to see for myself if it helps? I’m tired of sabotaging myself this way, no matter the level of severity.",

Just don’t have the social battery, find the volume of patients overwhelming and found the cases patients presented with overwhelming (my head just races too much as too much to focus on). \n\nI absolutely THRIVED when I did my masters as I could work my own schedule doing independent work then TA a couple times a week which I loved and was just the perfect trade off of what I enjoy and balance of social-ness (few meetings, teach few hours a week where I’m very involved and students love it then rest of week is independent work). But I’ve been really struggling to find a role that has a similar balance. \n\nMy main goal is to teach somewhere at post-secondary level and I’ve spent the last 6 months working my ass off to try to network and land something, but no luck. High school teacher while I know I’d be good at it and grew up with a parent who was a successful one, I know I’d burn out fast. Post secondary I’m teaching slightly fewer hours and I won’t be overwhelmed with all the other stuff teachers deal with daily (I have experience at both levels). I’ve looked at public health and plan to start a masters in that in the fall, but just had an interview today for a public health position that was marketed as research oriented, but I was asked a lot about my customer service and community planning skills as they want that for the role (which are probably the two biggest areas that burn me out the most). So I feel pretty stuck.\n\nAnyone else have worked in healthcare or education and made a similar transition?",

        "text": "I (28m) just had my first appointment with a psychiatrist about my ADHD today. She recommended I try Wellbutrin and some CBT to start out. She prescribed me 150mg of Wellbutrin for 15 days, then she said we'd bump it up to 300mg after that. After reading some of the comments on here about their experience with it, I'm a little scared to try it when it comes in. I know that there are always side effects when taking medication and that doesn't always mean I'll feel every side effect, but from what I can tell I'd have to take Wellbutrin for weeks just to see if it helps and if it doesn't I'd have to ween off it slowly for weeks. I don't want to have to experience shitty side effects for weeks before I even know if it'll work and then keep feeling the side effects just to ween myself off if it doesn't work. I told the psychiatrist while I wasn't against medication I don't want to have to rely on it all the time. I was thinking something that I could take whenever I needed it but then if I didn't need it I could just stop taking it whenever without feeling shitty side effects. Tbh I'm not even sure what I'm looking for with this post. But what are your thoughts? \n\nFor context, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 and took Ritalin for it. I stopped taking it when I entered high school. I don't remember what it was like before taking Ritalin, but looking back at my report cards I can see that my grades dropped when I entered high school. I enlisted in the military and never noticed any issues with my ADHD to the point that I almost questioned if I really had it and my mom just needed something to mellow me out cause she couldn't handle me (which after talking to her about it was not the case). I never had any problemscwith my ADHD until I got out of the military and had the freedom to do whatever I wanted. That's when i realized I couldn't focus on anything long enough to get any kind of hobbies I was interested in finished. I'd hyperfocus on one thing and even sometimes buy things for the hobby (ex. Woodworking) then maybe make one thing then have no interest in it for months. This made me rethink about my ADHD diagnosis and pursue treatment",

I mostly just had a headache in the afternoon/evening. I woke up the 2nd day with a massive headache that mostly went away after I took my dose. About 6 hours after taking my dose, the headache came back along with some dizziness that got progressively worse into the evening. 3rd day (yesterday) I felt better when I woke up and took my dose. Then again, 6 hours later, I started getting INSANE vertigo and nausea to the point that I had to call a family member to come get me from work. I have been making sure to eat and drink plenty throughout the day, so I don't think that has been causing it. I chose not to take my dose today and wait until I can talk to my doctor. I'm still getting random vertigo spells throughout the day and have barely been functional at work. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? This is my first time trying stimulants, and I knew there would be side effects. But I am feeling way worse than I was told to expect, and I am actually kinda scared to try taking another dose.",

Whatever you want to call it as there's debate in that community what label. \n\nTrying to do this while working, life stressors, getting caught in a tornado, family dying, it's been stressful and my career is taking longer than probably anyone else.\n\nI made it into a state-ran bootcamp to re-educate those who lost their jobs to COVID.   \nI had been working through Udemy so I had a foundation. \n\nMath has been very hard for this ADHD'er although I do like the longer problems because there's a satisfaction that comes from it. Also, I'm a very step-by-step person. To the point I wonder if I'm on the spectrum. I do understand that ADHD tends to lean that way.  \n\n\nI relate that, so you understand my problems with JavaScript (those that know it). I can't see the whole picture and sometimes that \"confuses\" my brain. I don't know if that's the right descriptor. I can do, HTML and CSS and some Python just fine. Sass, even some JS. But those damn if/the/for loops almost make my head hurt because I can't visualize it. I'm ***VERY*** visual. \n\nThe bootcamp was nearly a waste of time. A lot of their promises weren't remotely kept. \n\nAdd to that, my HDD had a malfunction a couple of months ago and I lost a LOT of data. I had a backup, of course, but that was corrupted. Murphy's Law in full swing. So I lost ALL of the coding and projects I'd been working on from the start. All the notes. The eBooks. Every damn thing. So that threw me into a depression.\n\nSo I've been trying to get back into it. The problem is that thing we do so well and hate. \"Well, I need to start over. Back at the beginning.\" I refuse to. I don't need to. But I can't wrap my thinking around starting back to re-learning JavaScript. Which I desperately need to. I have my course, Colt Steele, and I really like him. But even though I've finished a bootcamp, I've finished and got my Github cert, completed HTML and CSS, for the life of me, I can't ----- I don't know how to put this into words and that's also stressful ----- I can't visualize, or get the steps in my head of starting back in JavaScript.   \nI'm trying to start that section of the programming class, the JS section. But I don't understand why I am so damned paralyzed?\n\nIt's frustrating to say the least.  \n\n\nAny coders or anyone know what, why, how to get started and why this is such a block for me? Has anyone gone through anything similar?",

My mom wears earplugs and my dad has bad hearing, so I'm the only one that hears it. \n\nRight now it's 2:20 am for me and he was stomping until about 1:45 am. Over the past couple weeks I have gone up to his room mutiple times and calmly asked him to please be more quiet. After all those attemps didn't work I adressed this at the dinner table with my parents present. Hoping that we would be able to find a compromise. My brother basically had no input in the matter and my parents weren't that much help either. We \"compromised\" that he can VR game until 12 am.

When I was 18 I went to see a dr about my ADHD like symptoms, the doctor I went to said that he thought I had ADHD but didn’t want to prescribe me anything because it was a small hospital, said I should go to a bigger one (that deals mostly with mental illnesses) and explain the situation, give the doctors there his name and his opinion and ask if I could start treatment with medication. I did go to the bigger hospital and the doctor there looked at my file, saw that I had OCD and just said “it’s too late for an ADHD diagnosis,(was 18) it gets diagnosed as a child, can’t do anything for you, it’s probably your OCD, I’m gonna up your meds for that.” I left crying and never went to see a psychiatrist again. I managed everything else by myself so far and thought I could do this too. Fast forward to uni and adult life, I took Ritalin from a friend to see what it would do to me and the first time it worked, I did everything I was supposed to do, I was productive and ended up hysterically crying in the end because I never knew uninterrupted productivity and focus felt like. Now I’m 24, can’t hold a job, about to finish uni and I spend my days at home alone, sitting and on my phone, maybe getting a burst of energy for a task or two. My severe executive dysfunction puts me in a heavy depression state and I feel like I can’t move, I’m just wasting away. \n\n  I got a new appointment in a couple of weeks and I just would like to know what else I can do. I’m not after meds but I know I’m not strong enough to pull myself out of this. I have a feeling that this doctor will also not care about anything I say, won’t prescribe anything and just let me be. How can I express myself to be heard? If not, are there any of you that deal with ADHD without meds or any therapy. I just really need help. No friends, no social life, no will to exist. I’m tired. I used to be a “gifted child”, successful without even trying, strong willed, curious and insatiable, now I just sit and wait for the day to be over.",

We live in an area that’s experienced CRAZY high growth over the past couple of years. There is no ADHD medication here. None. \n\nEvery month I call every pharmacy in the area trying to find a place that has any part of his prescription in stock. Most places aren’t even accepting new Adderall patients right now because they’ve already requested the max amount than they can receive.\n\nI found 2 separate pharmacies that can fill the separate parts of his medication this morning (IR &amp; ER) !!!!! Hallelujah!! Except his doctor didn’t sent the Rx over before the end of the day. What are the odds that they’ll be in stock still tomorrow?? And even if they are in stock there - we just need to repeat it next month. Again.\n\nThis is wrecking everything. The constant anxiety. He has a test tomorrow he hasn’t been able to study for because he’s been out for the past week. Professor can’t do anything to help because he doesn’t have anything with the disability resource center. He doesn’t have anything with the university because every single psychiatrist/psychologist/neurologist/etc in town is over a year out. His doctor keeps telling him to wait and see how he feels at the next appointment 3 months out. HE DOESN’T HAVE 3 MONTHS.\n\nI’m seething. All of these hoops to jump through. The stress and inconsistent medication timing. How is this fair?? How is he supposed to function?????",

I get very much stuck on simple everyday stuff like doing laundry, doing the dishes, paying bills, etc. My wife keeps complaining about it, for a good reason, but I just can't keep myself from procrastinating. My wife takes care of paying the bills, keeping track of when I need to go to the dentist, getting a haircut , reminding me to refuel the car, telling me when to do everyday chores, etc. \n\nShe is getting tired of it and I don't blame her. I am not a child and she should not have to do all of these things yet I can't seem to get it done unless forced/reminded to. She knows what she signed up for by marrying me, that is my ADHD, but it still doesn't feel fair and I would like to do better. \n\nMy attention span and my short-term memory are crap so when I try to start something I usually end up doing something else. What's weird is that this is mostly a problem in my everyday life. At work im fine, not the best but I get by. \n\nMy theory is that I'm either just lazy, I spend all my energy at work or my brain somehow deprioritizes everything except work. \n\nCan anyone relate or have any tips on how to deal with this?",
