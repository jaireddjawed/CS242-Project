They're far smarter than I am, but has some baffling gaps in their knowledge when it comes to science (two examples: they thought penguins were mammals, and that some islands float), and it's something we joke about a bunch.\n\nAs such, I'd love any recommendations for an authoritative primer on science, particularly with a focus on natural history/biology. A lot of non-fiction science books I've found are either more specialised, or, if broader, focused more at children. Instead, I'm thinking something more in the vein of [The Penguin History of the World](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316944/the-penguin-history-of-the-world-by-j-m-roberts/) (strong recommend!) but for science. They're a voracious reader (typically literary non-fiction and literary fiction), so it's not a problem if it's pretty chunky. Thank you!",

        "text": "To say that we can indirectly observe electrons via scientific instruments just seems to be question begging; you're assuming that it's an electron causing the experimental results, which is exactly what we're trying to prove. All we actually know about are the observable results of experiments, for example, streaks through a cloud chamber, the properties of cathode rays, the terminal velocity of an oil drop, bubbles in liquid helium, a particular pattern produced by a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, or whatever. \n\nWe can then postulate that, if there were an object with such and such properties, call it an electron, that would explain the observational results that we're getting. This model may even make novel predictions about phenomena that it wasn't designed to account for. \n\nBut is it justified to then infer that our theory is actually (approximately) correct and that electrons and other unobservable entities actually exist? It seems like all of our past scientific theories about them were the same, they explained all the phenomena of their day and made novel predictions, until they were falsified because they contradicted experimental data. The early 20th century electrons that were literal material balls or actually orbited the nucleus of an atom like a planet are radically different entities from our modern conception of electrons, which arise from a quantum field and sometimes don't even have a definite position or momentum, and they appear to just share the same name because there is a set of phenomena that they can both explain (with our current model of course being able to explain more phenomena). \n\nWhat's to say that we're not in the same situation and that our models, like theirs, aren't similarly radically false? Does it even matter, is the point of science to \"get at reality\" or just to provide a model that we can use to make predictions and systematize our observations, and we remain agnostic about \"what there really is\"?",

I don't even know for sure that the first thing I'm going to mention would work.\n\nBUT I've been told that the cannabis plant, when it goes to flower, will suck up anything from the soil and directly add this stuff in its up taken form, in order to help make the flowers more attractive for pollinators. \n\nPeople have told me that chemicals are used to exploit this - stuff that gets you high when smoked, and that if you put this stuff into the dirt during flowering, then the plant will put it out onto the buds. I've been told the same thing happens with sugar - watering the plant with sugar water would put sugar crystals on the end of the buds. Wouldn't get you higher, but just look nicer I guess.\n\nSo my hypothesis is that you could take some plants, maybe only annuals, wait until flowering/fruiting, and then water it with (for example) fruit water. Could this be used to add specific terpenes into specific aromatic food plants, or something like that? \n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Here is a thought experiment I have come up with that I think proves that instantaneous communication leads to paradoxes, and is therefore impossible. It requires zero math, just the principle that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.  Does this make sense?\n\nImagine a train moving past a stationary platform.  In the exact center of one of the train cars is a light source, which is flipped on as that car passes the center of the platform. \n\nTo an observer in the frame of reference of the train, the car is motionless, and the light propagates towards the front of the car at speed c, and towards the back of the car at speed c.  Since the light is positioned in exactly the center of the car, the light hits the front wall of the car at exactly the same time as it hits the back wall.  (An observer on the car sitting next to the light can verify this, because the reflected light from the front wall and back wall will come back to her at exactly the same instant.(\\*)\n\nTo an observer in the frame of reference of the platform, the light propagates towards the front of the car at speed c, and also towards the back of the car at speed c, but the car is moving, so as the light propagates the back wall of the car moves towards the light source, and the front wall moves away from the light source.  So in the frame of reference of the platform, the back wall of the car is illuminated BEFORE the front wall of the car.   (An observer standing on the platform at the exact location where the light was turned on can verify this, because the reflected light from the back wall of the train car will come back to him slightly before the reflected light from the front wall of the train car.)\n\nSo that seems odd, but there’s no paradox; we already know that observers in different reference frames will get different measurements of time and distance.  Nonetheless, the results for each observer are unambiguous – each observer sees what they see, and there’s no conflict.\n\nNow let’s imagine there is an observer on the train at the back of the car, let’s call her Betty, and another observer on the train at the front of the car, let’s call her Flora.  We also line up observers all along the platform.  One of the observers on the platform, let’s call him Bill, sees that the back wall of the train car is illuminated exactly as it passes him.  Betty and Bill can smile at each other going by at the exact instant that they both see the light.  Similarly, when the light hits the front of the car, one of the observers on the platform, let’s call him Fred, sees that the front wall of the train car is illuminated exactly as it passes him.  Fred and Flora also see each other going past at exactly the same instant the light hits them.  \n\nSo to recap, Betty passes Bill at the exact instant they both see the light, and Flora passes Fred at the exact instant they both see the light.  In Betty and Flora’s frame of reference, because the light is in the center of the car, which is not moving with respect to them, they believe that Betty passed Bill at the same instant that Flora passed Fred.  In Bill and Fred’s frame of reference, because the light is in the center of the car, which is moving with respect to them, they believe that Bill saw Betty go past a little bit *before* Fred saw Flora go past. \n\nAgain, this is odd, but not a fatal paradox.  They may disagree about whether things were simultaneous or not, but this just leads us to conclude that things that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are not necessarily simultaneous in another.  But “simultaneous” is not something that can be directly measured, anyway, so there’s no paradox.\n\nBut now let’s give all of our observers, Fred, Bill, Flora, and Betty, our brand new wonderful quantum entanglement instantaneous communication devices.  Let's have Bill and Betty send out an instant message as they pass each other and the light hits them both.  It’s instantaneous communication, so Fred and Flora get the message at exactly the same instant.  We know that in Fred’s frame of reference the back wall of the car is illuminated first, so when Fred gets the message the light, and Flora, have not quite reached him yet.  But in Flora’s frame of reference the front and back of the car are illuminated at exactly the same time, so when she gets the message, the light will be just hitting her, and Fred will be right in front of her on the platform.  So, when Flora gets the instant message she sees Fred right in front of her.  But Fred, at that same instant, does NOT see Flora right in front of him.  Which is it?  It can’t be both!\n\nConclusion: Instantaneous communication is impossible.",

        "text": "So, I have **72 hydraulic actuators** at an open loop system. Each one needs only **0.07 liters** of hydraulic oil with **0,4 MPa** (4 bars) of pressure, if all actuated at same time, they would require **5.04 liters** of hydraulic oil. The hoses will have **16mm** of diameter and at maximum **1 meter** of length.\n\nThese need to actuate at one third of a second, so I'm assuming that **15 liters per second** of fluid flow speed would be required, and thus, **900 liters per minute**. Of course, assuming that what I just said isn't completely wrong.\n\nThe idea is that the hydraulic accumulator would have a pancake shape, having **1 meter** of diameter and **5 cm** of height. The same applies to the bladder, that would have these measurements and stay at **2 PSI** of pressure.\n\nI'm assuming that the large area in which the pressure is being applied will compensate for the low pressure inside the bladder. I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/qevIIQHrJZg?t=231) (already on the time mark I want you to see), which shows that by inflating a large bladder with **2 psi**, it can lift **1000 kg** of weight.\n\nSo, I was assuming that this would increase the amount of fluid flow to the actuators, however, as I inputed the volume of the pancake hydraulic accumulator (157079 cm³ or 10.37 gallons) in [this hydraulic accumulator calculator](https://www.accumulators.com/tool/calculate-usable-volume/), it said that such hydraulic accumulator would produce only 0\\*\\*,1 liters\\*\\*. Which is one of the basic principles of hydrostatic transmission of Pascal's law.\n\nI'm probably wrong here, so I would like to ask if such result is actually fine, or if it is incorrect.",

I found one meta-study that gathered information from others papers that showed effectiveness, including \"control quality\", but then nowhere in that paper is control or control groups mentioned again, it just says they gathered the information, and then apparently decided not to include it for publication. Otherwise I have only found controls that get no similar treatment (placebo or otherwise), which seems suspect to me, as participants would presumably see improvement just from seeing a specialist, or, in a group setting, exchanging tips and tricks with the other participants in the group, without that saying anything about the mindfulness content.\n\nI've read the content of one treatment program, and it has lots of woo, e.g. participants asked to imagine breading in or out through various body parts, imagining oxygen taking away pain, etc. that I associate with new age beliefs in \"life energy\" and moving it around the body. But there's a multitude of papers on this, and many medical systems using it, which would hopefully indicate there is something else to it. Or is it all just laundered Buddhism and New Age spirituality?\n\nWhat is the strongest evidence you can find?",

        "text": "In summary, my question is how can researchers deem something not contagious without studying every possible transmission route? Even the most little, random, unique scenarios? I can think of a million examples but I’ll just choose one. \n\nI once read an article about hospital associated infections from shared blood pressure cuffs due to the fact that they’re rarely disinfected and are in constant contact with skin of patients with different conditions/illnesses. I understand how infections can transmit this way, but how do they determine that certain diseases can’t in specific situations like this without specifically testing it? This can apply to anything but I’ll use ALS as my example as I know it is not contagious via direct contact, air, etc. \n\nBut going back to the BP cuff example, say an ALS patient had a BP cuff used on their skin and that cuff was then immediately used on a “healthy” patient who later had that exact spot of their skin opened up for an IV insertion. How doesn’t anything (skin cells, bacteria, etc) get into the bloodstream and transmit ALS to the healthy patient in the way that infections can? What if there were sores or open skin involved? Sweat? Blood? Anything? How do researchers come to the conclusion that it doesn’t transmit this way if it isn’t specifically tested? Or do they focus more on the behavior of disease? Has ALS ever been found to be transmitted in any way? I read another article about a brain disease having potential transmission routes due to prions so how is it that one neurological disease can transmit while from my understanding, all the others cannot? \n\nI hope this makes at least a bit of sense. I’ve just always been curious what goes into determining all of this.",
