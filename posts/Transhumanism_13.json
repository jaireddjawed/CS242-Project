        "text": "Odd question, but I guess ill start with my current concerns.\n\nI see much concern in the weakness of the human form (gee, specific!) as many people here do, but also in the rampant breeding of the third world, which contributed nothing to the advancement of the human race.\n\nUnpopular as it is to speak this, the current rates of breeding world wide represent a serious risk that the advancement of technology and the improvement of our species may be slowed or completely halted, meaning we may face stagnation once that population becomes domonant, specifically native africans, who produce almost nothing, and breed far outside their means due to the propping up of the carrying capacity by 1st world countries, and the growing number of muslims, where many influential leaders consider space flight to be equal to suicide, which is of course, discouraged. (Although, India and the rest of Asia may be the saviors we need, as the educated of these areas have the brains lacking in the less useful areas, and the breeding drive to match, plus a propensity to place less value on the concept of ethics and human rights which bog down advancement.)\n\nWhere do i even begin? What technologies are realistic even? Spaceflight, to separate the useful population from the nonuseful? Life extension or preservation, to allow the important minds to be saved, mayhaps to continue their work, or be saved until such a time that there is an intellectual revival, if it ever happened? Dare I say, virology, for a more immediate, if very dangerous fix? \n\nAny suggestions are appreciated. At 21, I want to get started now. Even if I die at 60, I want to know I contributed to the future of the species, or whatever we may become. Thanks!",

I don't think AI will solve everything, I'm more for the genetics side and think genetic modifications should be a main priority(maybe we can even make sure future generations can better handle cybernetic modifications), so my approach is one that is meticulous. \n\nTranshumanism to me is about becoming more than human, not accepting humanity nor human ideals as the standard but instead evolving BEYOND that. Currently, these ideas are not taken as seriously. The same mentality existed in other times too. People would say: \"Humans cannot fly, we are not birds, only silly people make such efforts\", yet now countries have air forces based on humans controlling apparatus capable of flight and firing weapons. Once, people probably opposed agriculture and laughed it off as a dream, and this is why those with more vision must bravely march forward. Those who don't come along with us should be free not to, but they should also not whine when they are left in the dust. The future of evolution belongs to Transhumanism because YES, humans are better off evolving as man evolved from the same common ancestor as did the chimp. ",

Right now it's all just pattern recognition.\" ... and all that jazz about how a program can only ultimately do what it is written to.\n\n So I thought, wait a minute, can't the same be said of us? Anything we ever think, process and do is also a pre-determined response based on our existing neural network. And we can't do what we're not programmed to do either - it's just that instead of direct imperatives being fed into our CNS, we have a DNA, one that declares how our body is created, deciding on the entirety of our minds' framework.\n\n There are certainly concepts we simply cannot in any way process. Things we simply can't think, because our neural structure is incompatible with them, of which I'm surr there are oodles more than what we can think of.\n\n Certain networks and certain hormones, preset in the blueprint of DNA, rule the entirety of our starting state as a program. With the initial variable set against our choice, despite the delay that is our lifespan and so-called nurture, the outcome is fully set without our wills. Think of it as a function - if a given X from a limited domain (that is every possible DNA sequence in a human) is chosen, the corresponding Y is the singular possible result.\n\n So as such, is true 'Natural Intelligence' possible? Can there exist any hardware that supports thought unaffected by it's structure? Creates meaning without an initial input? Synthesises it's own personality voluntarily, instead of being shaped? Can thought exist in a true informational vacuum? \n\n Can there ever be true AI if our own intellect is outside that framework, if we are entirely empty vessels without the world around us to make juxtapositions to and the initial settings provided by our genes?\n\nIn a sense, what I'm asking about, the idea of a thought that subsides in a conceptual vacuum, is quite similar to the theological concept of a soul.\n\n Humans can be observed to have no such independence, however, in a universe where not a single thing can exist without others to be relative to, where small enough entities cannot be pinned down as a certainty without a large enough surrounding structure to observe them, can a truly profound individual existence be born?",

So, according to this theory, if someone's pattern is copied, and inserted in a machine, the machine will be the person in all that matters.\n\nAbout multiverse: there is more than one multiverse theory. I think that two of the most famous is the Many-worlds interpretation in quantum mechanics, or the inflationary universe, also. (there is also the Brane multiverse. All are described in the multiverse article on Wikipedia).\n\nAccording to the many worlds interpretation, \"when a diversion in (quantum) events occurs\", there are many universes as possibilities of the quantum event. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people observed that maybe this means a kind of quantum immortality. Because if we die in a possible event, always will in some other event result in survive. But, others argue, with the passage of time, less and fewer possibilities are of our survival. Also, the quantum events are subatomic, there is no way to predict how they influence in our visible world, meaning in the death or survivor of someone but events like the quantum suicide, that are highly theoretical. \n\nBut: let's say that this interpretation of quantum mechanics is true, and also that information theory is true. Even if someone naturally dies in every world, odds are that in a great amount of worlds the information about this person will be replicated (can be naturally, or can be a world where science can develop informational pattern of past people). So, according to informational theory and this multiverse interpretation, a person probably would survive death.\n\nBut it's not the only multiverse theory that this could be possible. Let's says that some inflationary theory or landscape theory of the universe is true: our universe is one of the many that exist, not in a quantum event way like the example above, but at the same time and realm of existence, only separated by a long distance or something like a bubble. \n\nThe number of universes would be enormous, and one can be secure that almost every event possible would occur in a universe. \n\nSo, imagine that George died today in our universe. There is a universe far away from where a George (let's say George'), with all the information of the George of our universe, survived in a similar event. If a duplicate of George in our universe with the same information would be George, why George' could not be George? Also, odds are (if the theory is true) that in a great number of universes technology was already developed in order to upload minds. It's possible, even probable, that every mind (the information about) in existence today is uploaded in an incredible amount of universes. The uploads could be of the mind in the morning, the mind in the afternoon, the mind at night, every combination of time. ",

Confucious only talked about 'be nice to your king and your parents', and that was it. So, human rights in China is quite low, and its biological and transhumanic progress is pretty fast.\n\nI expect a lot of transhumanic progress will be made there, sometimes by western scientists, because of its much lower standard of ethics.\n\nEthics is like a hurdle to prevent the advance of tech. Dr. Morrow's island is better than a world with 5 billion Third Worlders.\n\nThe earth is going to be uninhabitable in 1 century. It is already a bit late - relaxing all restrictions about transhumanic researches might be the only way for salvation, and the jurisdictions which don't have ethical restrictions will be the winners of the research war.",
