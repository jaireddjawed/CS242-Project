Everything that was supposed to disappoint me, I fully expected, so I just enjoyed whatever else it offered. \n\nThe jokes, despite their delivery, made me laugh (e.g. “Who will teach him violence then?”, “That was sarcasm/Technically, that was just a lie”). I thought Doctor Fate and Hawkman were probably the better parts of this movie, and I am happy Aldis Hodge is in this role. I thought it could do without Cyclone or Atom, though. I was happily surprised by the CGI, especially the Doctor Fate effects (but it also reminded me of Doctor Strange).\n\nIt basically felt to me like a live action DC animated TV movie. It probably would have been better if someone else was in the lead and the plot was improved. What did you guys think?",

There was a talking broom. some kind of character who couldn't talk? i cant remember what it was. a tin man? statue? tree? i cant remember. there was a song about a vampire with no fangs. creepy witches at some point who made fun of the vampire or something?? that's all i remember. there's no way this was a fever dream, i remember watching it several times, but I can't find it anywhere.

Scott Fitzgerald was rolling in his grave when they heard that a 3D version of \"The Great Gatsby\" was being made.  Why would a great novel need to be glitzed up with a gimmick associated mostly with sci-fi movies?\n\nI think that was probably intentional; the point of the movie was to be blown away initially by the glitz and the glamor, only to realize eventually that it was hollow at its core.  If that's true, and if the 3D was intended as part of the \"glitz\", then I think it would qualify as the first (and, so far, only) \"ironic\" use of 3D in a movie.  Agree?

But man oh man, would it be a stretch to say that more than half of all TV and Movies rated above PG have a scene with a woman character peeing? I don’t think so. I genuinely think it’s close to 50%, maybe more. And it’s been that way for what feels like a decade. Before I start a show or a movie where the main character is a female, I’ll joke with my friends about how far we’ll go before the peeing scene. And by god, if I’m not right 95% of the time.\n\nI feel like this might get laughed out of the room. But I know there’s something to this. There have probably been more scenes of women peeing in TV and Film in the last decade than in the entire century before it combined.",

However, House Party ‘23 was wayyyyy better than the 4th and 5th movies by a mile!\n\nThere were some minor homages to the original movies in the newest one, and even a glimpse of the first movie is shown. Part of me wants to consider House Party ‘23 a legacy sequel, aka House Party 6, mainly because Kid N Play have a cameo. I checked the credits and their characters are credited as “Kid” and “Play,” respectively, just like movies 1-3 and 5.\n\nAnyway, the new movie was cool. There were few laughs.

There's not much I can say about it that hasn't already been said, but I was inspired to create my own trailer. Hope you enjoy!\n\nI also have a theory about the pizza I haven't seen yet: he keeps it frozen because he likes to kind of let it \"melt in his mouth\" , something people do with hard candies normally. But Cobra is not a normal person, and his pizza consumption tells us, the viewer, that this is a man who does things his own way.\n\nThe oversized shears make it possible to clip off bite-size chunks of the frozen pie. He does not simply bite into the slice because I suspect Cobra suffers from sensitive teeth and does not like the feeling of ice cold pizza against them (sensitive teeth may also explain the penchant for warm beer and aversion to ketchup)",

        "text": "With ChatGPT launching last year, A.I. is more prominent in the ethos than it's ever been. As someone who's learning to code, my interest in it has been growing, too. Though I've always been somewhat interested, it seems now that we're on the precipice of real breakthroughs. For these reasons I'm wondering what films really explore the future of A.I. and how people rank them in terms of looking at the actual technology.\n\nPersonally, I'd rate 2001: A Space Odyssey,  Ex Machina, and The Matrix at the very top of this group. I think they have real, relevant, and thought provoking points about the near and far future dangers of A.I.\n\n\nI'm certainly aware of Bladerunner, watched 2049, but never actually saw the original. Any others?",

I just want everyone’s reactions from movies.   \n\n\nWhat is a plot hole that always bugs you every time you watch the movie?\n\nWhich plot hole seems like the biggest one you’ve ever noticed?\n\nPersonally, in Star Wars, the fact that Ben never acknowledged R2-D2 as his old friend always bothered me. Some people try to get technical and say that “he never said that he didn’t know who R2-D2 is” but that just doesn’t cut it for me. They went on too many adventures for him to not recognize him. Besides why wouldn’t R2-D2 say something along with 3 CPO reminding Ben of who they are? I realized that the movies were made before the prequels, but did George Lucas say he had this whole thing planned out? Just my opinion \n\nWhat plot holes annoys you guys?",

It starts with a group of friends riding in a car and seeing someone in a Building above them flashing a light and they go in. Then horror stuff happens and at the end the girl sees her self outside in the car and she is the one flashing the light to try and stop them from coming in. \n\nWould be great if u could help me out.\n\nPs: I think it was called something with Demonic but I could be wrong.",

        "text": "Recently watched the new scream for the first time and turned it off halfway through due to the stupidity of the characters actions and dumb plot holes. The most egregious thing I noticed was how when ghost face is about to kill Ortega’s character, Sam and Stewy are driving in a car and then like 30 seconds later they’re popping out of an elevator to save her. How are they this fast? Also, how does ghost face not die after being shot several times by stewy, and why would stewy not just shoot him in the head after he’s knocked down instead of escorting the others to the elevator first. A gun is a ranged weapon(don’t have to shoot point blank for it to work.) Finally, we later learn that the ghost face was a teen girl. How could all of these grown ass men not overpower her? The amount of scenes where a person is about to be stabbed but holds off the knife with their hand is literally ridiculous in this film, but even if it somehow happened this many times, you’re telling me David Arquette can’t muscle up on a teenaged girl with a knife? So dumb!",
