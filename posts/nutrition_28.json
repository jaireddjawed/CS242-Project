Pretty expensive lol at work now and don't have them in front of me but\n\n- one with tons of super foods. \n- one with peptides? Amino acids I think they were.\n- pea protein \n- one for like daily vitamin stuff but just in powdered form.\n- and 1 pure matcha, love the taste lol\n\nI only do one scoop of each, some recommen 2 scoops but what them to last longer. So just do 1 or 1/2 they recommend.\n\nAm I actually absorbing everything? I mix it all in a blender at the same time. With about a liter of water. Drink it through out my 10 hour work day.\n\nIs this good, bad, to much at once? 3 days into it and I feel like I have more energy compared to just drinking coffee. But do urinate more then usual and people at work say I'm probably losing most of it.",

Though, do you think blood sugar spikes caused by eating too much fruit at once also can accelerate the aging process of your body?\n\nI've read that having blood sugar spikes accelerate the aging process which also affects skin (wrinkles etc). \n\nI know it's not good to have high GI foods like snacks or sweets, considering blood sugar spikes. But as you know fruits also contain some sugar, and you may also have spikes by eating too much fruits at once (especially the ones with higher GI)\n\nSo, when you simply consider slowing down the aging process caused by spikes, do you also avoid having fruits to the extent you get a spike like how you avoid having sweets? \n\nI'm sure those two are not technically the same because fruits have some beneficial effects unlike sweets, but I'm worried because sometimes I kind of get sleepy after eating some fruits and I wonder if it's not good for my health and skin.",

I know some people don't heat soy milk, but I like it that way.)\n\nCurrently, I count all the vitamins and minerals I get from So Good Essential+ in my cronometer. Could anyone tell me what vitamins and minerals I am losing by boiling the beverage? What about calcium? I am more worried about calcium than the others.\n\nThanks.",
