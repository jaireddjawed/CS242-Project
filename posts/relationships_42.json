        "text": "\\*TLDR\\* **Is love really this hard? What if I don't find someone else? Is it worth it to let go of my old fantasies of how love/life \"should\" be and focus my attention on creating a life with this person?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my boyfriend of 1 year,  I can't continue the relationship knowing he desperately wants kids and i don't know if I do. I’m not passionate enough to say “yes” and it's not fair to him to keep waiting on me. I completely lost myself in the relationship. His version of reality vs. mine are completely different due to this lack of understanding my perspective. There is little curiosity in how I think, he is constantly on his phone around me,  I don't feel reassured, and I feel worse when I share my feelings rather than being soothed and validated.\n\nHe is not the most romantic person, and he's mentioned several times that him responding to me the way I want him to respond (e.g., i'm not going anywhere babe, i love you so much, and i understand you're upset) is not natural for him.  The point is, I love him and I can tell he put in effort in his own way to meet my needs. I want to be with him and cultivate a deep connection but I feel like what I'm asking is essentially renovating his whole personality. In your experience, do you think it's possible for us to put in the work to create the conditions to continue the relationship or would it be in my best interest to cut ties and focus on myself and let go of trying to make it work? \n\nWhat's holding me back from letting go is my negative thoughts. I feel like I ruin my chance of happiness by consistently yearning what I don't have and regretting the things I didn't do when I was in my 20s. He makes a lot of money, we have fun together, he's great with kids, everyone loves him, he's charismatic, responsible, super family oriented, ambitious, and we have great physical intimacy.",

One day he pushed my hand down and said “I like that”. I don’t like to kink shame people so even though it was super weird for me, I put a finger in. Thinking about it makes me cringe though. It’s not like a vagina…..it’s dry and hard and I just did not like it. \n\nEventually one day, he again pushed my hand down. For whatever reason, I was like, screw it whatever and put a finger in and went off. He was jerking off at the same time and it did not take him very long to finish. When he finished, he said, “omg you literally milked me”. \n\nIdk how to feel lol. It’s so awkward to think about tbh. I sometimes wonder, why did that happen. Super cringe. \n\nI’m honestly just posting this here to get it off my chest. Is he actually straight if he likes this? \n\nTL;DR: is he really heterosexual if he likes his butt fingered? I have np if he’s bisexual at all. Just would like to know what you think!",

        "text": "Okay this post might be a little long so please bare with me. My ex-friend and I fell out in December of 2022. I was very much devastated, the same day I cried for hours at night due to that being my only friend for years. I eventually got over it because once our relationship was over a whole bunch of people came out the woodwork telling me everything she said about me that I know I’ve only trusted her with. I left her alone and blocked her on everything. Didn’t bother to care from that point. \n\nJan 2023 I get a random message on messenger from her 2nd acc saying “Hey I just want to apologize for everything and it’s no beef between us, we just don’t have to talk” I simply reacted with the heart emoji and kept going about my day.\n\nFeb 2023- She contacts me from instagram and was fussing me out. Only thing I regret was replying back but I eventually ended up blocking her once more \n\nNow this is where things get tricky… because I can’t avoid her at this point \nShe stays in my neighborhood, just recently moved in 5 months ago. (I moved in a year ago if that matters) she stays in a completely different building but she’s always at mine! At first it was just little nitpicking but after awhile she seen I wasn’t phasing her. She started to do little gestures like sticking her middle finger up, walking up to my car asking if I wanted to fight, even watching me pick and drop off my daughter from her bus stop.\n\nI felt as though enough is enough and I’m not going to put up with it so I reported her to the office they told me the next time she does something to call the police to have police reports &amp; the next incident that happened was my shoes getting stolen at my front door. My neighbor has a ring camera pointing directly at my door but she didn’t want to give the footage up (they are friends now ) so i was just like okay… I’ll just get my refund back but what eventually ended up happening was my cousin called the police herself and explained she’s been harassing me and she won’t leave me alone- she also threw in she had a warrant. She got arrested that day &amp; after that day forward she has called the police on me on 4 multiple occasions \n\nFirst one ) I stole her shoes and phone (that was gifted to me last year on my birthday) police said they can’t force me to give it back and it’s consider a civil case since it was a gift I gave it back and left it alone\n\nSecond incident) I’m posting her on Snapchat and I told the world she had herpes but that was not the case. I only post my kid and nephew that day. I showed the officer \n\nYesterday night I get a knock again and it’s the police but this time they came with CPS \nThe CPS lady told me she got a call that I was using drugs around the kids so she drug tested me. I passed… but now they are talking about keeping the case open for 30 days. Once they left I think all the patience left out of my body I really wanted to knock on her door and drag her out but I thought about my child\n\nToday I plan on obtaining a police report from the incident she got arrested for and possibly get a restraining order. I’m not sure if that will work but she’s going overboard. \n\nTDLR; OLD FRIEND KEEPS HARASSING ME W/ POLICE",

        "text": "Hi guys, so I understand that this might not be as serious as some of the other posts for advice on here but I'm worried that my son's use of homophobic slurs is having a very negative effect on our relationship and that if he keeps speaking in this way it's going to get him into a lot of trouble in the future. \n\nSo, this happens pretty much any time I try and speak with my son. If I ask him to do the dishes, for example, he'll tell me to go fuck myself, followed by him calling me a homophobic slur (the worst one). He does this no matter what I'm speaking to him about. He also doesn't seem to use this language when speaking to anyone else, just me. We live in an otherwise normal household where me and my wife speak with each other and with our son and his sister with complete respect. We have tried to raise our children to have respect for others so I'm not sure where he has gotten this language from.\n\nI have tried sitting him down and telling him he can't use this language but he gets very verbally agressive and claims that I'm infringing on his right to free speech. I have tried disciplining him in the traditional ways (taking away his things, not letting him go out with friends, etc) but it doesn't seem to have an effect. Do you guys have any recommendations on how I can make him stop speaking this way?\n\n**TL:DR** - My son keeps using homophobic language, specifically towards me, and I don't know how to make it stop.",

We get along great, have a lot in common and good chemistry with each other I think. We had a conversation last night that I’ve been thinking on pretty heavily. \n\nSo for context, he does have a young child and him and the mother have been separated since before the child was born. They have a very complicated, back and forth relationship with each other. I try to remain neutral in these conversations because I know that I’m only getting one side of the story and I don’t know the mother/her circumstances. I know from personal experience that these relationships can be messy and hard for everyone involved and that’s why I’m so torn on my feelings. \n\nLast night we had been talking about our past few days since it had been awhile since we last spoken/seen each other. He starts telling me that he’s been feeling very guilty because he enjoys spending time with me but he’s got commitment issues and it’s been hard for him to let go of the idea of raising his son with his ex/mother of his child. He did make it very clear that he’s not trying to lead me on and that he does have some kind of feelings towards me but that he needs me to give him time to get there. \n\nWhen we are together he is completely focused on being there in the moment, he doesn’t give me any bad feelings or things to be worried about other than the conversation last night. We have stopped texting as often but I wrote that off as him just not being the kind of person who wants to talk 24/7 (which is fine neither am I) and he backed this feeling up by saying he also felt like he was being flaky by doing this as well. \n\nI guess my question is do I cut my losses and go now? Are these issues potentially big things that he needs to deal with on his own? Am I stupid to hold out hope that this super sweet man will realize his worth and move on from his ex? \n\n\nTLDR: I started seeing someone who hasn’t fully moved on from their ex and I think he could be good for me but am stuck on what to do….",

After my last relationship I went on a bit of a tinder tyrade that Im not proud of, but it led me to find one in a million of them that I fell in love with instantly. Everything about him was different.

I fell in love with him instantly.  \n\n\nWe had everything in common, from music, hobbies, interests, and shared a lot of the same background and future goals of having a stable, loving family. I asked him if we should be official after 3 dates and he agreed. It kind of shocked me because I didnt see myself ending up in a relationship off of tinder, but there it was. We dated for only about 2 months, which may not seem long I get, but I had never experienced anyone who was as kind and loving as he was and understanding of my situation of having 2 mini-me's. Not a day went by since our first date that we didn't talk in some form 24/7.  \n\n\nUntil one day I broke down my mental barriers while we were, well, doing it, and I told him I was in love with him. He said it back. Two days later it hit me how fast we were going, and I realized I still needed a ton of \"me\" time to find myself after being with other people for my entire life. I kind of had an anxiety attack about realizing I never even meant to get myself into a relationship, and I told him. I could tell it crushed him and it hurt me to do it but I thought it was for the best for the future of my kids to work on my own life first. He was really hurt and confused the first day, but texted me the next day saying he understood and would give me a few days to think everything through and that we could meet that weekend to talk about going slower, or ending things for good. \n\nI spent that week wracking my brain about how we could make it work, and remembered again my kids and how I needed to provide for them first before jumping into something with someone. I went there the night we planned with the intention of just saying goodbye, but when I saw him and hugged him I instantly melted and remembered how much I really love him. His hands and his kisses were just everything. I told him we could try starting over but going more slowly. He was so happy.\n\nWe were going good for a week, back to texting and flirting everyday. Until one day at work he texted me something super flirty that reminded me again that Im going to fall for him super fast all over again and I just wasnt ready. In a really, really, bad timing, an old fling texted me that same day asking to get a drink.. and we ended up sleeping together. Bf knew something was wrong when I didnt text him that night, and texted me in the morning asking if I was okay. I blew up at him, telling him I told him I wasnt ready, I didnt think we were actually in a relationship and he shouldnt take this as another breakup.. I insulted him and belittled him and blocked his number.\n\nI felt bad later that night, unblocked him and we had a really long conversation into the night where we told each other how much we meant, but that I had cheated on him and we just will never work. I could feel his heart breaking through text messages. I told him I was so sorry and that I knew if I wasnt so stupid, we couldve made it work and we wouldve been amazing. I was so in love with him and him with me and I ruined everything because I couldnt get over my own anxiety about letting someone like him into my life. I feel like I'll regret this forever and never forgive myself. Ive never cheated on anyone and the fact that I could do it to the person that seemed like they loved me more than anyone ever has before scares me. I feel like Im damaged beyond repair. I know some people will tell me Im a piece of garbage and I deserve it. I just dont have anyone else to talk to.  \n\n\nTl;dr: I met the perfect guy and absolutely shattered his world and ruined any shot at having what could have been the best, and last, relationship I would have ever been in and I hate myself for it",

She's my twin and she's always been the dominant one in our relationship, keeping me below her. I'm very insecure and struggle socially.\n\nI met my childhood friend 2 years ago and we talked a lot about our time growing up and stuff and she also mentioned how in high school she wrote a really long and horrible letter to a classmate. I was shocked to hear it was her. Not long after that I was talking quite casually to my sister and I brought up and she got mad and told me it wasn't her.\n\nIs it weird if I ask my childhood friend how she knows it was my sister who wrote the letter? I'm struggling to accept the possibility that my sister may not be a \"good person\" and I feel like finding out whether she wrote it may or may not give me just a little more clarity.\n\nThis childhood friend also said that my sister always demeaned her, much in the same way as I'm realizing she has been doing to me. It's actually how we became friends again (from high school forward). I couldn't interact with her before because I basically wasn't allowed in the same friend circle as my sister's, which my friend was in.\n\nI've kept my distance to my sister for the most part, but she was in a terrible accident a few years ago due to psychosis and we became close after that. And I somehow feel like I'm sacrificing my own identity to be in touch with her. She also blocked me from seeing her Instagram stories a few months for no reason and blocked one of our common friends. I feel like breaking contact with her would be the best solution but I also fear that some of her behavior may be due to her past psychosis and that she will relapse if I don't spend time with her or something. I read that psychosis can be caused by of lack of social contact. But she does seem to spend time with friends so maybe she'll be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Therapist says that my sister(F26 has been gaslighting me most of my life and shows narcissistic traits. When I(F26) was catching up with a childhood friend told me she(F26) told me my sister wrote a really mean letter to one of our classmates. My sister denies it but I feel like asking my friend how she knows it's true because it's bugging me and I struggle to understand the true nature of my sister.",

        "text": "So basically, I split up with my boyfriend at the weekend after I had a really bad mental breakdown - I’ve been really suffering with my mental health lately and taking things out on him. I kept refusing to see that I can’t get better on my own and need therapy which I am now getting. I’m at fault for the breakup and for my unpredictable moods however he was no angel either and refuses to accept that.\n\nHe would sometimes accuse me of faking being ill for attention when psychiatrists have told me I am genuinely unwell due to a lot of stress and caring for a sick family member, studying a degree that has mentally broke me and that I have now had to give up. I’m tired of being riddled with guilt, that I’m always to blame, I was so wrapped up in my own life just trying to cope on a daily basis.\n\nAfter we split I asked him if we could both sort ourselves out if there would be any hope of us getting back together as it never used to be like this before I became ill and before he got a new job, when I told my close friends we split up they couldn’t believe it as they thought we were the ‘ideal couple’ and still say give it time we might get back together which I would love. Although he said he’s not in the right headspace for a relationship anymore and is fed up feeling bad.\n\nRight now though I’m hurt and angry and maybe I don’t have a right to be. He said after the breakup that he would be there if I needed to talk to him, we can message each other whenever we want, none of us have removed each other of social media, he still has in a relationship with me on Facebook.\n\nIts been 5 days and I haven’t heard from him, he told me he’d come round and drop my stuff off but hasn’t. I offered to come and get it but he didn’t want me to and I don’t want to look crazy. He also hasn’t told me what’s happening with money I paid towards our holiday that he cancelled.\n\nTL:DR maybe I am going mad as it’s only been 5 days since the breakup, my ex said he would be there if I wanted to talk, hasn’t removed our relationship status or pictures off Facebook, hasn’t returned my stuff and won’t answer my text. It’s like he just doesn’t care anymore. I don’t know how long to wait until reaching out again?",

        "text": "Me and my husband are not divorced yet but have been separated (different countries) since Christmas. You can find the backstory about how this happened in my previous posts.\n\nI am not able to understand his behavior. He was the main one wanting this separation, during our last 4 months together he was constantly asking me to leave, which was very hurtful to me. I ultimately decided to leave when I found out he was texting some girls from the gym.\n\nThese are some of the behaviors I'm trying to decipher:\n\n1) Ask written in previous posts, in January he asked me to go back so we could \"close\" the relationship in a better way and get the divorce. I didn't accept because I was still very hurt, but with time I tend to forgive and forget. \n\n2) I know someone might not like this, but we still share google positions. Why? I don't know. He never deleted mine or stopped sharing his. He's not a dangerous person so nothing to worry about, but I am curious to see if he will ever admit checking my position. He happens to text me every time I go out at evenings (visiting family or friends). Is this a coincidence? I'm not sure. The messages he sends in these situations are nothing deep, mostly about my stuff which he hasn't sent me yet but says he will.\n\n3) Some weeks ago he asked me in a very polite way if I would want to keep his electric vehicle until the end of the lease, which I accepted because I need a car. He then changed his mind very abruptly few days later. Not sure if this is the reason, but in those days I had changed my whatsapp picture from a picture of my cat to a nice picture of myself. In the past he used to assume that when I put a picture of myself is because I'm texting men..no comment. I changed back to my cat.\n\n4) Few days ago I was feeling very low. I told him that missed him and asked him if he would mind if I visited him. He said in a cold way that I could visit so I could pick up my stuff. I asked if he could help me with the trip expenses and he said no (he used to do it in the past). And that was it. The next day I felt very depressed for this millionth refusal.\n\n5) Yesterday he first asks me if I would like to have his suv (he's leasing two cars) in case he had to move back to his home country. He said that it's the safest car in the world. He then deleted this message, but I had read it on the screen notification already.\nHe then asks if I can visit him this week. He deleted this too. \nI then asked for explanation and he says that I could visit to get my stuff the next day (today) because it's the only good day for him. This is a quite long trip to have to organize with less than a day so I try to compromise for the following week but no. It's either his way or nothing. He also accepts helping me with the trip expenses. I guess I have questioned his idea for too long saying that next week would be better and when I do this, he ultimately changes his mind. We've been texting all day trying to figure this out, but in the end he ended it by saying it's best for him to send my stuff and that he's not helping me to go there. (It's absolutely more convenient to ship my stuff than paying for a trip there just to get one piece of luggage out of four that will still need to be shipped somehow, and I'm sure he knows this too; if it's not clear enough, I'm looking for an excuse to see him, but what does HE want?)\n\nJust like it happened in January, I know that in few days I might regret not following his \"order\" to do exactly what he says and be there the next day. He does not accept being questioned now, and if I don't do like he pleases he will go back to be rude to me or not contacting me for some days (until I go out again maybe). I would like to visit him without the pressure of having to follow strictly what he says. There might never be another occasion and I have just ruined this chance where he was basically asking me to meet.\n\ntl;dr my husband and I have been separated since Christmas but he contacts me often, is this normal or he is just messing with my healing process?",

These instances seems so small when looked at individually but after three years its starting to add up and I don't want to even be around it. Nothing I say about it is taken seriously.\n\nAlso, my opinions are regularly invalidated or need to be confirmed by someone else(generally a man) in order to be considered?

Since a couple of months, when we meet during the walk we kiss in the cheek and talk. I am not going to lie, I like it and she looks for the kiss too. Every time we meet we talk about how we are.

We can meet 2-3 times a week, even more, and some weeks maybe zero (not that frequent).\n\nI am really bad at relationships, so I am not sure if I should try to stop this or it is a nice habit.

        "text": "My GF and I have been thinking of getting a living arrangement together as we both live with our parents. Together we both make between $70-80k annually ($40k for me and $37k for her). Places are $1500-1600/month (maybe if we're lucky we'll find something cheaper). Together I believe we can make it work and live comfortably. I have around $450 of bills already, and she has around $750. If we move in together I agree to pay the big bill which would be the rent and she would pay all other small bills such as utilities and food (which could be between $600-800/month). She agrees to it but she is kind of reluctant toward that idea because she would prefer we get married first before living together, so until then I believe she would moreso want for me to pay the rent and also a few other smaller bills. To make it abundantly clear, she is still fine with us living together before then. I don't think it's wise to propose to someone while still living with my parents and not having my own place first because I don't want to have to, or even both of us to rely on them anymore than we already do. Also She has also told me she considered living with her friend and in that case, her and her friend would split all bills in half. I told her there's no point in her being on the lease if I'm having to pay the rent and some of the other bills plus my own and she didn't like the way that sounded. She somewhat also feels she won't have enough money if she has to pay her own bills plus the potential $600-800/month. I've been trying to explain to her that If we both make a budget we should theoretically be just fine. \n\nTL;DR My GF is reluctant to pay all the smaller bills even though I would be paying the bigger bill (Rent) but has told me she would split expenses half and half with her female friend if they moved in together. \n\nAm I not seeing her POV fairly? What should I tell her so she feels more inclined to contribute? Is it a good idea to move in together?",

        "text": "My ex and I have been together for the past year. Our relationship has been pretty rocky and tumultuous. We broke up plenty of times only to find our way back together to try “one last time”. Which made me believe that maybe we are actually made for each other and we just need to work on our differences. \n\nComes one day I find an empty condom wrapper. We fought so hard about this but he was adamant that the condom wrapper was old and was stuffed away somewhere in a bag and forgot to throw it away. That it wasn’t a big deal and just “trash”. He made me believe that all my feelings of being upset were brought upon myself and that I had blown things out of proportion causing him unnecessary stress. He never once felt the need to apologise and when he eventually did, it was so hard for me to forgive him. My mind is bewildered thinking how could an old empty condom wrapper look so creaseless. It actually took a toll on me and created a lot of trust issues. Moving on a week later after having moved out and doing my own thing he asks me to try to work things out but I’m still very bitter about the situation and I refuse to move forward and be alright. I chose to end things and not look back. He is now telling me things like “don’t associate me with you, don’t tell people we’ve dated.” I don’t know what to feel anymore except anger and pure disappointment. Did I make the right decision of walking away from all of this? He still has it in him to make me feel like i was the one that  destroyed us and the whole problem is me. I know I shouldn’t feel this way but I’m so angry and it makes me hate him.\n\nTL;DR! Hit my final straw in my relationship after finding an empty condom wrapper and made feel bad about myself",

Any advice would be great.\n\nTLDR: boyfriend’s friend is studying to be massage therapist and wants to practice. He has been receiving regular massages from her.

Anyways throughout our relationship i’ve realized how insecure and controlling he is. He hates me having social media bc men will lust over me, i’ve deleted most of my accounts to make him happy. Once we got back together we agreed to not look at each other phones, i agreed. He couldn’t hold up his end of the bargain and went through my phone, i didn’t care cause i have nothing to hide. Next day, i went through his phone and i saw a message in his boys group chat, of him lusting over this tik tok girl so ofc i felt shitty, saying how attractive she is and that she’s a 9: He snatched the phone out of my hand and was worried of me looking through it. I asked why and he said during our breakup, he talked shit about me to his friends and called me a c***. Mind you, he also gave me chalymdia, so i chalked it up to him not knowing and leaving it undetected bc he didn’t get tested a lot before. Whatever, i forgave him for it but i don’t know what he expects for me? to not be weary of what he has in his phone and not be worried that he’s cheating. Either way i forgiven him for it. Fast forward to now, he got mad at at two things i said. I told told him that this women flirted with me at my job but i shut her down and told her i’m taken and by accident she grazed her hand by ass, i’m pretty sure it wasn’t by accident. I was trying to look for comfort in him and he shut me down. Of course, i should of yelled at her and told her to fuck her bc something i freeze up when stuff like that happen. I’ve been assaulted badly in the past so now i struggle with confronting people and ik it’s bad. Then he got mad at this comment i made about some older men, i said “i’ve been with a older guy and they go after young women bc it’s easier to manipulate them”. I wasn’t trying to make him jealous at all i was just speaking my mind and nothing i say or do is good enough for him. He got very angry and told me off he doesn’t want to be with someone who’s so “passive” in life. I’ve never felt this low in my life.\n\n\nTL;DR my bf broke with me again because of two harmless comments i’ve made.",

        "text": "In the past my prior relationships with guys  were with manipulative jerks and it destroyed a sense of trust I had in others. In hindsight, I see that those relationships were not built off of a true connection, but rather my own longing to quell my loneliness and combat my feelings of being unworthy of love. Eventually I was able to return to a state of normalcy. I moved out east, left all those emotions far away and started a new life; It was liberating. \n\nI was accepted to the university of my dreams, I completed my first semester- it was both challenging and rewarding. Deep within me I figured I could never date again until I was 30. Because I was shaken up badly before and had decided that keeping my head down and prioritizing building a good career was the best thing for me. \n\nA number months ago a started an internship out of town. I was happy, because my life was now “on-track” towards the success I desired. \n\nWell, the same number of months ago, I just happened to meet a guy. We just clicked, despite being wildly different people; and so became good friends. We went out and did things together since we had the spare time. He’d tell my about his work and I’d tell him about mine. Over time it became explicit that friendship was developing into something more. The feelings we acquired were mutual. And it just made sense. \n\nThis may be the first time I’ve actually felt love in a way that wasn’t just superficial and meant to compensate for my own insecurities. It saddens me to think how I wasted my time with horrible guys in the past. I can say with honesty, I’ve never felt this truly incredible.\n\nBut as with all good things, perhaps we can’t expect them to last. We realized that very soon, our situation would become a lot less convenient. I’d have to move again and go back to school; so would he (we attend different schools). I had a long conversation with him, he made it clear that a long-distance relationship just wouldn’t be something he’d be able to handle. \n\nWe had decided that perhaps the best thing was to snip off the relationship sooner rather than later. We could still keep in touch as friends, and that perhaps in a few years after we’ve completed our degrees we can revisit these feelings. In that way, we’d be able to focus on establishing good careers for ourselves; something that both of us inherently value. \n\nI think now that my brain understands well that this is the right thing to do, but my heart just doesn’t want to accept it. \n\nPart of me forces myself to imagine a scenario that after such a long time he might find someone else and that I’d just be a parted memory. It would be utterly devastating to me. \n\nI suppose it’s impossible to say what might happen in the future. If it was meant to be, of course it would be meant to be and we could be happy in the future. If feelings change, it probably wasn’t meant to be. \n\nI wish emotions could be a lot easier convinced that I’ve made the right choice. \n\nI’m looking for advice to ease the inside pain, (preferably without alcohol). I nearly bawled my eyes out at work the other day and that’s when I realized it should be about the time that I get over this. \n\nTl;dr: I’ve met someone incredible that I wish  I could be with, but our lives and schedules don’t align. Having difficulty accepting just friendship even if it’s a smart decision. Looking for advice on how to process emotions.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nAs you can see, this is less of relationship advice and more so break-up advice. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I saw 3.3 million members and thought surely break-ups have to be relevant here. Also, long, rambling post so please bare with me. \n\nI was in a 5 year relationship with my best friend. We weren't best friends before, but we became best friends. Out of anything we had, mutual love and respect were the thing we had most. We were both very affectionate to each other, understanding, and supportive. The issue in our relationship came in that we were long distance for essentially the entirety of our relationship. We're both in post-graduate school. I've lived in a student house my entire 7 years, while she has lived at home. In undergrad, we saw each other quite a bit as we were in the same program. However, since post-grad, its been 2-3 weekends per month. This is okay, but it's one of the little things that ultimately added to the decision to break-up. The biggest reason for the break-up was the next chapter. Ever since before I met her, I had my career planned out. My sister was a couple years ahead of me in the same profession, and we knew from the start that we were going to build a practice together. Fast forward 7 years after starting university and the practice is semi-established and is ready for me to enter. The only issue? It's 8 hours away. Unfortunately, we never really talked about this issue. It was moreso the plan that we both knew wasn't going to change, and if we would have a life she would move up with me. Long long story short, the day after my birthday and a small argument, she let me know that she doesn't see herself moving up to this city with me, and that therefore we should split-up. She packs her bags, takes her belongings from my room, we share a hug and a little bit of a cry, and then she leaves. We talk a bit that night and start talking about how maybe deep down we were unhappy in some portions of the relationship. In all honesty, she was talking about how she was unhappy deep down. She mentioned that whenever we would argue, she would lose feelings. For context, our arguments were moreso discussions of an issue. We never yelled, or said anything personal/hurtful. Therefore, I always found arguments beneficial. Even with friends, I found that arguments are an oppurtunity to grow together. She disagreed. I don't want to get into details because I have no intention of blaming anyone. There's more to this, but it's over and the little details don't matter in this case. Anyway, on that first night, I explained how I had been very happy and it was a surprise that we were going to end our relationship. Next day, I start to think about what she said. She said something about that we became comfortable in a safe relationship. The more I thought about it, the more that rang true. Although we do have a high level of love and respect for each other, I think there were a lot of things we tended to ignore to avoid splitting. Unfortunately, after not resolving them over 5 years, they added up to the point where it became make or break. So, day 2, I started to consider that maybe breaking up was the best. Day 3 I felt this sense of peace and excitement... Wow, I'm single now! Lets go. Let the fun begin. I was really confused at this feeling. Well, fast forward one day and I download tinder. I don't know why, but I guess it's just something you do when you break up and don't know what else to do. That night (last night) something about downloading tinder triggered something in me that reminded me this was all real. That my best friend and I are breaking up. No more hugs, kisses, memories, waking up together. I woke up about 7 times last night, shivering, and woke up feeling like I have to vomit. The last few days have been a rollercoaster. I've never dealt with a break up and I guess I just would like to know if anyone can relate to this whirlwind I've been going through. Additionally, we are getting lunch on Sunday to have a conversation of closure. We will probably discuss what the plan moving forward is in terms of interaction. I know she wants to remain in communication, which I am okay with trying. But I'm also wondering what everyone's experience is with that kind of situation? Thank you and much appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Dating 5 years, we broke up amicably. Went from surprise, to understanding, to peace, to moving on, to nausea and withdrawal.",

        "text": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for nearly 3 years and we live together. In that time we have both gone through a few different jobs for various reasons. My gf was working full time when we got together. She hated the job she was in said it was causing her anxiety and depression to worsen. This caused a lot of sick days and she eventually got fired. She then got a temporary job before she started university which again resulted in a lot of sick days.\n\nWhen she started university she was working part time. She enjoyed this job but realised she needed extra income so took a second part time job. This worked well for a while until the sick days started increasing for the second job. My gf said it caused her terrible anxiety and she hated working there. Luckily the job she enjoyed offered her more hours so she quit the second job and doubled her hours and responsibility at the job she likes.\n\nWithin a month she's now complaining about her job and about how it's affecting her negatively. I sat down to talk to her and pointed out this seems to be a pattern whenever she is given any responsibility or works more than just a couple of hours a shift she starts to find reasons to hate the job.\n\nShe accused me of not believing her and that the previous jobs were causing anxiety. I asked if this job is doing the same and she just repeated that she's starting to dislike the job. I suggested talking to her doctor or going on a waiting list for therapy to talk through what causes the problems she has with working and she said she doesn't need to. I asked her what she was planning to do towards the end of the year when she'll need to work full time and she just said she'll be fine. I tried explaining that I understand she has anxiety around work but it doesn't look like it's the individual jobs causing the problems so it might be best to look into talking to someone to get some extra support.\n\nShe repeated that it was the job causing the problems but I pointed out the likelihood of it being the job every time is pretty slim and she needs to look at what's causing the issues so it doesn't happen again in the future since the chance is wherever she works isn't going to be a perfect workplace and will have some things she might not like and learning how to deal with that when it happens would be beneficial\n\nShe told me I was being unsupportive and not believing her and that I was blaming her for the struggles she's had while at the jobs. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?\n\ntl;dr my gf has gone through 3 or 4 jobs where she has ended up with anxiety and called in sick a lot. Now she's working more at a job she likes it's still happening again but she refuses to see it may not just be the jobs causing it. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nedit: I posted this yesterday but it got removed for being too vague so I have added some details and tried to make the question clearer",

        "text": "Yeah this sounds pathetic but hey ho, making friends as adults is hard!\n\nSo I'm 30(M) in a decent job and in August I wound up hanging out with my friend, his now ex girlfriend and a few of her friends after going to see the Book of Mormon. \n\nOne of her friends was super nerdy (like me) and we wound up talking about all sorts of stuff we have in common in terms of interest and swapped numbers.\n\nWe've been talking off and on via messages but it's very stop/start. We tried to arrange hanging out but we've both been that busy that things have gotten in the way between us both being busy, her being sick one time and me having an intense course until June, but we still chat because we both play Genshin, although sometimes it feels like that's all we talk about at times. Sometimes she'll respond to a message a week after I've sent something or laugh at a meme but it feels like I'm putting in more effort at times.\n\nWe tried making plans to hang out in October but things just didn't work out but otherwise we've only seen each other at group get-togethers a grand total of 3 times, but each time we got on like a house on fire.\n\nThe thing is I'm the most socially awkward bugger alive and I'm TERRIBLE at reading the room and don't want to be like a lost puppy or anything. After my friend and his now ex broke up I sent her a message to the effect of \"hey, I don't know if you'd find it weird still talking but I'd like to carry on if you're cool with it\" because of the whole friend of the friend of the ex situation, and she said she was still down to talk and possibly hang.\n\nShe's recently mentioned to me she's been having issues with whatsapp and her friend (friend's ex) mentioned this in an unrelated conversation (we were discussing professional things and the conversation shifted to life so things just came up). I ended up asking if the woman I'm talking about had mentioned anything about me or if she's said she isn't interested to which my friend's ex said \"I don't think she's actively not interested, but she's very quiet about these things\" and recommended that I try something low-key to check the vibe. \n\nI'm probably MASSIVELY OVERTHINKING THINGS but at the same time I'm hopeless at making friends outside of work and my small circle of guy friends. I don't want to blow her phone up with messages when we don't really know much about each other's lives (it hasn't come up) and I don't want to come off as a creep. While I find her attractive and cute in a nerdy way I'm also conscious we don't really know each other outside of interests and I'm happy to just be friends (plus what if she's a psychopath who puts milk in before her cereal? What if she thinks I'm a psychopath for being a law studying masochist?). \n\nI suppose my question is what the hell do I do? I don't want to come off as a creep but I'd like to try and get to know her better and see where the friendship goes. I just don't want to overwhelm her if she's the naturally introverted sort. It's just hard trying to get to know someone when sometimes the conversation fizzles out for days to weeks at a time and sometimes I'd love a big flashing neon sign saying \"NOT INTERESTED, STOP TALKING\"\n\nTL:DR: I've been chatting with a girl I've met a handful of times since August. I'd love to get to know her better and meet in person but things keep getting in the way. The conversation can die for days to weeks at a time. I don't want to come off as a creep or something. I'd appreciate any constructive advice. I'm just massively overthinking things after previous relationships fell apart and I don't want to risk putting too much in and getting hurt again. What do?",

Most days when we're chilling he gets extremely solid hard but we won't have sex which is fine. However when we casually do get intimate and I get on top or whatever most times he isn't as solid. He's still erected but it doesn't feel solid if that makes sense? Yet he ejaculates really quickly.\n\nIs this because he's not attracted to me or is this normal ? He doesn't struggle to actually ejaculate he last about 5-20 mins. (Most of the time I'd say 5 to 15minutes.) He tells me he's completely satisfied with me and I am the best he has had. He doesn't smoke or drink and eats relatively healthy. I don't have a problem with anything at all I just feel like maybe there's something I can't do for him sexually even though he seems satisfied?\n\nI have never been with anyone else and so I don't know what is expected is this completely normal or what should I do? Like if he was with someone better looking would it still be the same for him or is it because he's used to me now ? \n\nTl;Dr - my boyfriend isn't completely solid during sex. Erected and ejaculates really quickly but not throbbing hard is this normal ?",

        "text": "Hey guys, so first of all I wasn't sure if to post this in relationship\\_advice or personalfinance, but I guess this is a good start.\n\nI'm a 22M, I make 80k USD a year (converted, I'm not from America), in the past months I have bought my very own first car (used, not new) and just 2 months ago I started renting my own small apartment and living alone for the first time, this is also my first time living in a city. (Formely lived in a small... town or village I guess you could call it).\n\nAll my life I was taught and used to living very frugally; up until a year ago when I started opening up a bit I barely spent any money on anything (lived with my mom), only food and the occassional recreational/hobby something once every month or two but that's it.\n\nTwo months ago I started dating this super amazing girl (21F) and I'm really into her, I really like her, I can absolutely imagine a long-term relationship with her, but it's still very early into our dating and we're taking things slow.\n\nOn our first few dates I paid for both of us (which honestly physically made me a little uncomfortable to spend that much money that frequently, but I tried my best to keep it inside), then on a few dates I asked if we could pay half/half and she agreed, saying it was no problem. Then one night I had an open conversation with her and we discussed \"gender expectations\" and paying on dates, so I took this opportunity to ask her what she thinks of men paying everything on dates, and she explained she see's it as the guy's way of proving to the girl that he wants to spend his time with her and that she is important to him.\n\nI suppose I see it a little differently, I believe everything should be as fair and equal as possible so why shouldn't the women pay her fair share on dates/shared expenses? I did listen to her though and tried my best to understand and I can see the point she's making it; she basically saying it's romantic for the men to pay to show his appreciation and his desire to be with the women.\n\nI must admit I'm also a little self-concious about her \"using\" me to go on free dates. I really like her, and I already trust her to a degree, but I don't know her that well, we met from online dating so it's not like we got a mutual friend that can vouch for her or something.\n\nI checked my finances for the past month and saw that for the first time since I started working, I used more money than I made during that month. This isn't a big deal, thanks to me saving and living frugally I got quite a bit saved up, but it still hurt a little to see I wasn't able to save up more money from the past month. Obviously not all of last month expenses were from dates, but I'm sure paying for two people in restaraunts/other places several times a week didn't help.\n\nSo my basic plan for the near future is to keep spoiling her and paying for dates and stuff, as best as I can. I'm doing my best to tell myself it's a \"long-term investment\" and not just a waste of money to legitimize it inside my head as much as possible. My hope is that eventually, if/when we move past the dating/honeymoon phase we could split expenses more evenly/fairly, of course that will also require more open conversations and compromises as we build our relationship together, it won't be easy but that won't stop me.\n\nI guess my question is: Is this a good plan? Is it considered normal for the men to pay for the women on \"so many\" dates? (\"so many\" in quotes because that could be subjective and I'm a relatively frugal guy). I want to make her happy and for us to have a great time and a future but not if it means me going broke and destroying my financial future.\n\nI should also mention of course that she works part-time and is studying in university, so maybe it would make more sense for me to pay for her more because she earns much less than me and is busy studying.\n\nTLDR: Started dating a new amazing girl, she's the best, but I'm a little uncomfortable paying for both of us on so many dates and would love some advice/guidance.",

She's super confident and stuff \n\nThe thing is my boyfriend and I have been in this relationship for a little over a year. But he keeps putting his female best friend's picture as his whatsapp dp. He'd quite often post her pictures on Instagram and write captions like \"my favorite person\". He would literally shower her with presents and flowers on her birthday. But he's never done anything for me. On my birthday he just texted me \"happy birthday sexy b*tch\" and asked to sext. \n\nI've tried to talk to him about his behavior towards her but he would just brush me off saying that I'm overthinking. He once even called me a \"jealous, insecure pr!ck\" because I complained about his behavior to him. He speaks very highly of her. He says she's kind, intelligent  hard working. He once said that her relationship with him was the most important thing for him. \n\nI've asked him numerous times if he liked her and if he did, we can just go our separate ways. But he denies it and says that it's nothing like that\n\nI don't know what to do. The constant cognitive dissonance is making me incredibly resentful. My mind says he's in love with her but at the same time I wanna believe him. Any advice ? And what should I make of his behavior.\n\n\nTL;DR : my boyfriend speaks very highly of her female best friend. He sends her flowers and presents to her regularly.

        "text": "As above my girlfriend has told me how all her exes (3)\nWe're nicer than me, exes never treat me like this, never made me suicidal and even had the I've had bigger than you comment from her.\nI've done so much for this woman I work 50-60hrs a week and take her out all at my expense, I make sure the house is kept warm while she isn't at work.\nI've booked a night out for her and a friend with tickets to a show and hotel paid for by me.\nI do the little things like make her breakfast after I've finished nightshift and she's in bed still, I drove her to and from her last night out, I cook for her, I run her a bath for after work, ill go out my way to do and make her happy yet I get the feeling she isn't happy when she's saying things like that.\n\n\nTl; Dr : girlfriend tells me how exes are nicer, never treat her this bad and that one was bigger than me (penis wise)\nAny advice would be great, thank you.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year. Our relationship has been amazing. Up until this point I’ve been incredibly happy!\n\nMy boyfriend was at a birthday party with his group of friends &amp; a mutual friend of mine. I was invited, but I had work.\n\nWhile at work, I got a missed call + text from my friend telling me that they had seen a girl in the group coming onto my boyfriend. I’ve met the girl before and we got along really well! She seemed really lovely, but a little bit insecure and deep in some friend-cest in the general group.\n\nI took my friends call after work &amp; she proceeded to tell me that she saw the girl kiss my partner. He apparently did not kiss her back, he got upset at her &amp; it was a generally awkward semi-public confrontation for the both of them.\n\nI immediately texted my boyfriend &amp; he called me back soon after to confirm the story and apologise.\nApparently she was incredibly drunk, feeling insecure &amp; they were having a big conversation about how she was worthy of love and yada yada and she misread it and went for a kiss.\n\nWe had a chat about it &amp; slept on it. \n\nI woke up to a text from the girl apologising for her behaviour &amp; my boyfriend and I talked it over &amp; he casually mentioned how it might be a bit awkward hanging out for a while. I expressed some discomfort at him continuing to pursue a friendship so immediately after she clearly disrespected our relationship. He said that she was going through a rough time right now, that the kiss was a drunken mistake &amp; that he’s known the girl for years &amp; it’s not a judge of her character.\n\nI said it doesn’t really matter how good of a person she is at heart, that it was an extremely disrespectful thing to do to *me*, and that while I’m not saying they can’t reconnect again in the future - I don’t think it’s appropriate for him to be hanging around her in the near future.\n\nHe seems to find it controlling for me to put rules on a friendship he has, though he understands why it would be uncomfortable for me &amp; is happy for me to come along to any hangouts while I get comfortable. (While they still regularly text privately). He’s concerned for her mental state if he were to distance from her right now.\n\nI don’t think he has any feelings for her, and I’m not too concerned with ‘watching’ them during hang outs. I wouldn’t be with someone I had an inkling would cheat on me. I have a problem with the fact that he doesn’t seem to understand it’s just disrespectful. That what she did was something that was done to BOTH of us, not just him &amp; that it’s frankly embarrassing for him to be treating it so minimally.\n\nI don’t want to turn this into some sort of ultimatum, but I’m not sure if I can continue to be in a relationship with him if he doesn’t understand me here. Am I being too harsh?\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend wants to keep being friends with a girl that publically came onto him despite my wishes.",
