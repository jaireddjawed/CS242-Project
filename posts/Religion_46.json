That way it would prove that all religions are correct? Doesn't that sound a lot easier to believe?",

You can argue with me all you want about how the bible is true about homsexuality being a sin, chances are I still won't agree with you). And what I mean by misinformation is that God really should've revealed himself to us so that his words wouldn't have been altered, manipulated and corrupted through political editing and mistranslation.\n\nAnd another thing I wanna point out, we definitely shouldn't use it to jusitify the thought that those who believe in a different god are bound to suffer.\n\nSo yeah. Do you agree that we shouldn't use the bible to justify awful things like that?",

I would however consider myself to be a strongly spiritual person. I had avoided it for a long time, but in the past few months I've started the process of examining my beliefs.\n\nI have always felt a strong connection to nature, and my most \"profound\" religious experiences have occurred in secluded, unspoiled places. Walking in these places I often experience strong feelings of oneness, and I experience a sort of ironic comfort that nature is disinterested in me, that I am insignificant, a tiny speck in the vastness of time and space.\n\nI feel that there is an essential life force/energy which pervades all things. I believe that there is a higher power which is the collective sum of of that energy.  I'm not sure that \"God\" is the right term, and I don't really think that this \"God\" has any specific \"will\" or \"purpose\" for the universe, but who am I to know? The afterlife, if there is one, seems equally unknowable; I haven't been there.\n\nWhile I think that most religious texts have worth, I value personal experience and observation over the word of others. I believe that all people and all living things have worth, and that we should do our best to respect each other and the environment.\n\nWhat would you call these beliefs? What religions/philosophies are similar? I guess a sort of pantheism or panentheism? Someone told me I sound a bit like Spinoza or the American Trancendentalists? My mom says it sounds like a bunch of garbage and I need to start going to church more",

But if they were to be born and raised in somewhere like Saudi Arabia they'd most likely grow up to be Muslim, just like how someone would grow uo to be Hindu in India or Shintoist in Japan.\n\nMy whole point is that all of us in the U.S. (and mostly the Western world) really shouldn't be stereotyping non-Christian religions as satanic because everyone has diffefent ways of thinking about how life works.

        "text": "I'm going to assume that most of us are aware that for several centuries after the crucifixion, Christological \"heresies\" were a dime-a-dozen. Some folks believed that Christ was not divine. Some folks believed that Christ had two natures, one divine and one human. Some folks believed that Christ was entirely divine, with no human aspects. So on and so forth. The various ecumenical councils came to several successive conclusions about both the nature of Christ and His relationship to the Father and the Holy Spirit, but it took several of these for mainstream Christianity to come to a final conclusion regarding these subjects.\n\nHowever, it seems to me - perhaps wrongly - that up until the Council of Nicaea, any given Christological doctrine could have been the one to come out on top as the \"mainstream\" doctrine. So my question is this, for those who might know or have some idea:\n\nWhy did Trinitarianism and Chalcedonianism come out on top in early Christianity's theological debates? More specifically, what philosophical *aspects* of these doctrines - and their natural consequences - were more appealing to Church thinkers at the time - and perhaps even the laity - that resulted in them settling on them instead of other doctrines? What was it that made these folks want Chalcedonianism over Monophytism, and so forth?",
