        "text": "One of my more memorable times from being a sysadmin was when we had a fire in our server room. This was a few years back, when I worked at an SMB with around 300 employees. Our on prem server room was one we had built out when we moved into the building a couple years earlier.  \n\nIt had originated as small server room/telco room, which we expanded into a small office next to it. We made it large enough to house around 5-6 racks in one row and had it all nicely wired up by our favorite contractors. No raised floor (one story building on a slab), only using commercial building AC (this became a different story - standard AC units aren't designed to run in below freezing temps outside, but servers still need cooling).  \n\nWe also inherited a 22kva Leibert UPS, one of the always on varieties so it converts utility power to clean power. I believe these are called in-line UPSs. We also had an ATS (automatic transfer switch) connected to our generator. The ATS and non-server room power panels were all in another utility closet around 100' from the server room. We were able to get a server contract in place for the UPS and they regularly came out and serviced it, replacing batteries as needed and other PM if needed.  \n\nSince this UPS wasn't big enough to handle everything we had a few smaller, rack mount type UPSs to take up some of the extra load and give redundant UPS to some of the equipment.  \n\nOne nice summer day I am on my commute home, almost home, and get a phone call from my manager, $M, that I needed to come back in. There was a fire in the server room! He had stayed a little late so happened to be there when it happened.  \n\nI got back and the fire department had a big truck outside the front door and a few other trucks and a bunch of fire fighters, $FF, wandering around. I was glad to see there wasn't a big jet of flame coming out the roof of the building or black smoke billowing around. I found $M outside and we were able get permission from the $FF to go into the building back to the server room area. They were still working on the 'issue'.  \n\n$M and I got back to the server room area and we found out that the problem was with the tall, grey, piece of technology - it was smoking and jets of fire were coming out the back of it. They had sprayed it with an extinguisher which they brought with them which contained water and dispensed it in a fine mist. The $FF said this worked well on electrical type fires. It had put the fire out but the $FF wanted to get electric cut to this device since it was hard wired into the utilities with a thick cable. Of course, this tall, grey, piece of technology was the UPS and that thick cable was its power feed from the ATS in the utility closet.  \n\nOne may wonder why no fire suppression inside the room came on. This was because the fire had never left the UPS box and didn't heat up the room enough to cause the water (yes, water) sprinklers to kick in. We had never had the budget to convert the room to halon. Halon or water really would not have made a big difference in this case as the issue was that until power was cut to the device that it still would have been dangerous. Water could have made a nice shock hazard though.  \n\nAnyways, we all went to the utility closet and had to get someone from the building management company since they had the key to this door. They showed up, we got in there, and turned off power at the ATS and the other panels which lead to the server room for power not going through the ATS/UPS setup.  \n\nAt this point the $FF start to go into cleanup mode and we talk a bit about our next steps. They eventually leave and it's now me, $M, and our other sysadmin, who also came back in to help out. I think we had a few other non IT and big boss, $BB, came in to 'help'. The three of us talked about it a bit and we wanted to get systems back online as much as possible. To do this we needed power to the server room. To get that we needed to bypass the UPS so we had to call our electrician to come out after hours, probably around 8pm or so by now, to do some emergency work.  \n\nDue to the $FF usage of the water mist extinguisher we didn't have any other pieces of equipment fail or get destroyed due to water inundation. When the electrician, $E, got there we asked if we could turn on the other panel while he worked on giving us a non-UPSed set of twist-lock plugs for all the power strips going to the server racks. We got the other panel back on and started deciding priorities for what needed power to get the essentials of the servers and network back up. Most of the networking was on the smaller UPSs already but we were able to move some of the server rack power strips over. We wanted to get the SAN going again first and then a few ESX server up in the cluster to handle the most important VMs.  \n\nWe wound up having a big chunk of the servers running on utility power for a while, a scary thing in the US during the summer - frequent thunderstorms can cause power flickers or high AC load on a really hot afternoon can cause a brownout, all of which we had no protection from for the foreseeable future.  \n\nWe were able to do all this that evening, I think we stayed until around 2 or 3am getting this stuff running knowing that we would need to come in the next morning at the regular time to handle our normal 'fires'. It was fun calling our Leibert rep telling them about our incident. They had never heard of such a thing happening before and replaced the entire UPS as part of the service contract. I think we paid around $7k/year for that contract, and we made our money's worth on it!  \n\nIt did take several weeks to get the replacement unit in and wired up and then we had to plan on how to cut back over to the new UPS since we didn't want to overload something by unplugging one of the redundant power supplies, which causes the other power supply to take full load and since the small UPS and/or panel was a band aid solution it wasn't designed for full load. There were of course several pieces of equipment which had only one power supply, like older Cisco routers, which we had to plan a down-time for.  \n\nWhat an ordeal!  \n\nSo, N+1 in everything, even that expensive UPS which should have N+1 inside it, is important and can make a difference.  \n\nP.S. - we still didn't get a halon system after that. We got a dry fire extinguisher in the server room and put shields under the sprinkler heads on top of the server racks to hopefully direct water away from the servers in case of a future event.  \n\nTL;DR - old UPS in the server room caught fire, fire fighters killed power to everything, emergency call to electrician to get some stuff back online.  \n\n",

        "text": "I have the unique (or maybe not-so-unique) position of being one of those \"all-in-one\" employees for a small company. I manage the IT, the operations/bills/invoices, and the administrative staff, along with various and sundry tasks. We have one admin who is notorious for making everything really difficult for no god damned reason. We'll call her Difficult Dana (DD).\n\nSo, in short, the account executives use a big Excel sheet for their leads which the admins manage and update as needed. It's a pretty simple system. Also, these are all saved to our network drive which is backed up daily. Save frequently, and you won't have any problems. Most of these worksheets cap out at like 1MB, even with thousands of leads. It's just text, after all.\n\nBut no. DD's plan has to have rules and macros and formatting conditions and duplicate detecting, making this rather small plan rack up a size of like 7MB. To no surprise of my own, she complains of it crashing often--we don't have great systems here--so I tell her she either has to get rid of all that nonsense or save it frequently. I set her up for it to save every 5 minutes and turn Auto Recover on, just for my own sanity.\n\nSo, one day she sends me a message around 4:45PM that it's crashed and she's lost an entire day's work. I tell her to open it up and click the file in the lefthand recovery pane. She says she did and it's corrupt. I write back DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING and head down the hall. Before going, I see the file was last saved at 4:30PM.\n\nI get there and the plan is on her screen. Interesting...\n\n&gt; Me: Did you get it working? This seems to be functioning fine.\n\n&gt; DD: No, there's supposed to be a ton of new leads right below line 56.\n\n&gt; Me: Did you close the recovery pane?\n\n&gt; DD: Yeah\n\n&gt; Me: After I specifically told you not to...\n\n&gt; DD: Well I figured it was corrupted anyway, so...\n\nI verify that she autosave feature was still set to 5 minutes, and it was actually set to save every ONE minute, and strangely Auto Recover has been turned off completely.\n\n&gt; Me: You worked on this all day and didn't save it once?\n\n&gt; DD: I did, several times. I've closed it before lunch and opened it afterwards, too.\n\n&gt; Me: Look, you *must* have accidentally saved it in a different folder or something... there's nothing in the temp files from the auto save or auto recovery settings and if you've saved this manually several times today, then SOMETHING should be here.\n\n&gt; DD: Whatever, I guess I'll just get started on all that work again...\n\nSensing a lie but not wanting to stay later than I have to, I go back over to my office. My coworker (another admin, privy to DD's ways) catches me on the way back and asks what happened.\n\n&gt; Me: DD didn't do any work today.",

I do monthly maintenance on the server, but thats not backups. You have *nightly* backups.\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"No, you're wrong. The last two months we've had this problem.\" \n\n&gt;(Unspoken: \"...and we're just telling you now\") \n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"The backups aren't happening. Every time you do that monthly backup thing, I have to go back and put Quickbooks in multi-user host mode.\"\n\nAs I'm remoting in, my eye twitches. Did she say 'multi-user host mode'? \n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, the backups are working just fine. What did you say, you're putting Quickbooks in multi-user mode? Can I see what you're doing? Please demonstrate.\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"I go here and click Utilities and then Start Multi-user hosting.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Why are you doing that? You have the Quickbooks server, and that is doing the multi-user hosting for the whole organization. When you do what you just did, you're making *your* machine the server.\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"No, no, you don't know what you're talking about. ***I know all about Quickbooks***.\"\n\nNow mind you, I really don't know shit about the intricacies of non-profit finance and all that. But I've been supporting Quickbooks thru its various versions, in multi-user situations, for several years. I understand how Quickbooks is *supposed* to work. (and for some reason, this outfit had just switched from Peachtree to Quickbooks, still not sure why, so this was a very fresh implementation of new software. Not some crufty old patch-upon-patch situation where they changed ways of doing things mid-stream or something)\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, but this means you could be corrupting the Quickbooks file, and you're not using the multi-user hosting via the server. It reverts to single-user mode because you're leaving your Quickbooks file open at the end of the day when we're doing monthly maintenance and not closing it.\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"Why should I close it?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Hmmm, lets think. How about the notification email I send out 2 days and then 1 day in advance of the maintneance window that says 'Please close all apps with files open to the server before the maintenance window'?\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"You don't know what you're saying, we don't have a Quickbooks server!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yes, you do. And by the way, here is the link to the Intuit documentation on the subject. See here where it says that you're not supposed to turn on hosting on the workstations? And here's the link to the documentation I sent you, and stored on your server, following the implementation.\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"Oh, that information isn't right. We don't have a server. My computer is the server.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, no. We had this conversation 3 months ago when we converted you from Peachtree to Quickbooks. Everybody should be opening the shared file on the server. Where it gets backed up. Using the Quickbooks Server Manager and the multi-user features of the server. Thats the way we set this up in March, and the entire department was working that way when we turned it over to you. And you said 'I know how this all works, I've used Quickbooks for years'.\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"But that's not the way it worked at my last company.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did you have a domain server at your last company?\"\n\n&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: \"No, it was just two PCs. And my PC was the server.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well, now you’re at a place with dozens of PCs, 5 of which are in the Finance Department, including yours,  and are running the Quickbooks client and talking to the file server in the back room that is hosting the Quickbooks file and using the Quickbooks server component to manage access. You're in a totally different environment here.\"\n\nTurns out that she’d convinced 2 of the people in Finance to connect to “her copy” of the company books hosted on her PC, while the other two people in Finance, including the payroll clerk, were still (correctly) communicating to the server-based version. Receivables and some other stuff were in one version of the Quickbooks books, and payables and payroll were in another. Suddenly (at the end of the quarter is my guess), none of the numbers matched up.\n\nThe $Clueless CFO and the two clerks had to spend three days manually re-entering all the deposits and receivables they’d originally entered in the wrong version to the server-hosted Quickbooks file.\n\nThe worst part is, the next day the $CluelessNonProfit.$ExecutiveDirector called me up in a tizzy because her quarterly financial report to the board was going to be “late” and it was because “you didn’t backup the server” and “I’m going to have to tell the board that your company isn’t doing its job.”\n\nI had to go back thru the whole thing and walk her thru it step by step:\n\n* how the Quickbooks server component works; \n* how it was setup *correctly* three months prior (and documented, both in a document emailed to $ExecutiveDirector, $CluelessCFO and the rest of the Finance Dept at the completion of the work, and also kept in the Finance share, under \"Quickbooks Documentation\");\n* how *two* of the five people in Finance were using it the way it was intended to be used and by the documentation; and \n* how the $CluelessCFO had gotten confused by the way she’d used Quickbooks at her prior company and went off the reservation. \n \n(I held back the part where I realized that I’d learned more in the finance course I took in college than this “CFO” knew about finance *entirely*)\n\nAbout 30 days later I got a call from this $CluelessNonProfit to deactivate the $CluelessCFO’s account while she was being frog-marched out the door.  Turns out, this entire episode, including my documentation for all the work I had to do to fix her screw up, was used as the reason to get rid of her.\n\n[Edit: formatting]",

        "text": "Hello there! I've got another tale from my local library where I work as a Computer Lab Clerk, helping people who don't have computers themselves. This one's fairly short, but involves a bewildered patron (BP) who had some interesting ideas about how colors work.   \n\n\nBP came up to the front desk and pulled out a yellow sheet of paper. Very quickly he fired off a round of questions (or maybe they were all one question).  \n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"Hello Miss, where would I go to ensure...this paper like, ensure it's color and the lines...I'd wanna make another like, with the areas blotted but...like a Xerox.\"  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Oh, you want to make a copy?\"  \n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"Yeah, also can I use your white-out?\"  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Sure, here you go.\"  \n\n\n\nBP begins whiting out something on his yellow sheet of paper, and after a few minutes requests my help with the copy machine. So I show him how everything works, ensure he's getting what he wants (a one-sided colored copy), and finally push the start button. He at first seemed satisfied with the result, but noticed something out of place.  \n\n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"No it did it wrong, look!\" *points to the white lines where he applied white-out* \"That's supposed to be black, not white...\"  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"I'm sorry?\"  \n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"The white-out...it should come up black.\"  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"I'm sorry sir, but white-out is white, so it will show up white on a copy.\"  \n\n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"Let's do a black and white copy then.\"  \n\n\nNow I know I should have tried to explain at this point the result would be the same, but I was so confused that I actually started to think he might be right. Of course, he was not right, and he was not satisfied.  \n\n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"I don't understand...it's never done it like that before.\"  \n\n\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Well, white-out is white, so it'll show up white. You could draw over it with a pen or black marker if you needed it black though! Would you like me to grab you one?\"  \n\n\n&gt;**BP**: \"No...nevermind.\"  \n\n\n\n\nSo we made a few more copies and that was that. I'm still not sure why he needed it blacked out instead of whited out, why he thought white-out would show up black, or why he didn't want to just use a marker to draw over it. Hopefully whatever he needed that document for goes smoothly.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Caller ID shows its one of our more local customers, a$SmallCompany, a family-owned business who are really nice folks and easy to get along with.  \n\nSadly, only one person at $SmallCompany, $AccountingSupervisor, has any clue about anything technology.  They had a fairly complex server-based credit-card and billing system for one part of their business (a stand-alone retail kiosk system for their products at two locations, one of which is 8 miles from their main location), but for the most part that system runs beautifully without intervention and they have a third-party company that manages the software-to-hardware interfaces and the credit card settlement system for this, so most of what we concern ourselves with is their admin computing and their VPN connection to the remote location.\n\nThe $BusinessOwner is a nice lady in her 60s, but she's very old school and set in her ways. \n\n&gt;$BusinessOwner: \"Our website is down! You have to fix this immediately!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (checking) \"Your site is right here. Its fine.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessOwner: \"No, when I type in the address, I get all this Manta stuff and websitelooker and all this other stuff but not the website. Its down.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Wait, let me remote in and see what you're doing.\"\n\nTurns out, the $BusinessOwner was typing $SmallCompanyURL into the MSN search box in Internet Exploder, and then clicking \"search,\" and then pawing thru the Bing search results, which don't even include a link to their actual website but a crapload of things like yellowpages.com and other worthless junk in the first 8-10 entries.\n\nRemotely, I typed in $SmallCompanyURL in the browser address bar on her computer and hit enter. Up pops their website.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Nope, working like a champ.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessOwner: \"I didn't know you could do that!\"\n\nI am constantly stunned by people who type the URL for Google into their browser address line, but then type the URL for their own website into the Google search and pick from the results.\n\nWhat made this even a little funnier was that this $SmallCompany's web site had actually *\"disappeared\"* about 3 months prior to this call. *And they never noticed.* \n\nAbout 6 weeks after the site went MIA, they called me in a tizzy that their website was \"broken.\" *(We had nothing to do with their website prior to this. During our onboarding with $SmallCompany, they said \"Nope, nope, the website is good to go. We have someone for that,\" so I just told them \"OK, well, if you ever want to talk hosting or whatever, say the word\" and left it at that)* \n\n&gt;$Me: (checking) “Its not actually broken, its completely *gone*. Domain name and everything.”\n\n&gt;$AccountingSupervisor: \"What!?\"\n\nTurns out that the $WebOutfit they had managing their domain and hosting just … stopped.  Like the company, probably called **Joe Blow’s Fly-by-night Web Development and Coffee Shop**, just quit doing what they were doing.  And never told anybody, or if they did, it was an email and the $BusinessOwner thought it was spam.\n\nAll we had to go on was a HostGator \"This site doesn't exist\" message and the email address of the person they used to deal with at $WebOutfit.\n\nEven worse, in digging into their domain, I discovered that they had ZERO control of their domain name. Not as Registrant, Admin, Technical or Billing Contact. Nothing. \n\nI eventually managed to get the $SmallCompany domain transferred into their control (with us as Tech contact) and set up hosting for them. When I went to scarf down the base HTML files from the Internet Archive, I discovered that the original was in Wordpress and thus really not re-createable like I had hoped.\n\nI built a quick static page that basically was a screenshot of their old site with text that said \"Our new site is under development, please call our office..\" (they're a small local company anyway. They're were not doing any business via this site except as a way for people to call or email them) and they immediately embarked on a search for a web developer.\n\nThe fact that it took $BusinessOwner SIX WEEKS to realize her site was missing just killed me.\n\n[Edit: phrasing]",

I work IT, along with $Sup.\n\n$Sup - Other IT Guy\n\n$Dale - $Warehouse/Machine Sup\n\n$Davis - $Machine Sup\n\n$Boss - Branch Manager\n\n$Jose - Production Manager\n\nAfter the [Emergency Meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/80gnzx/the_emergency_meeting/), I was demoralized. I felt bad, I didn't wanna go to work, and I instantly started looking for other jobs. Over the past week, I haven't felt like really coming into work.\n\nEventually, $Sup got moved to a later time, and I am still on production, and a tech. So I have to hit a goal that's reasonable and repair units and machines at the same time, while $Sup works on the stuff that we can't work on if someone's using it. Should be simple... right?\n\nI clock in at 06:00. It's a cold morning here in $state, which is unusual but not unheard of. I walk into the break room to grab my jacket, and as soon as I head out the door $Davis runs up to me. \n\nDavis: \"$Me, we got a problem. $Sup took out a bunch of power supplies and never replaced them. We have a machine down.\"\n\nI got extremely upset. I couldn't do production, do my IT stuff during the day, and pick up his slack at the same time. So I called a meeting with $Dale, $Jose, and $Boss. I asked $Davis to tag along, because as supervisor, he could point out and show them his point of view on it.\n\nWell, my friends, $Sup sent an email to $Boss, $Jose, and $Dale about the power supplies. Not me, not $Davis, just them. He never communicated anything... \n\nand in his email, he said he didn't have enough time to put it back together.\n\nHe was there for 8.5 hours, stayed overtime, and it really only takes a couple of hours to fix it. I believe his ass got royally grilled by $Boss, and I have yet to see the aftermath of it. I just hope I don't get targeted, because $Sup did save my job back in that meeting. Hopefully things change for the better and not the worst. Only time will tell..",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I really enjoy reading the stories on here. I have never contributed myself until now so here is a small story. \n\nSo this just happened a few moments ago and it is an occurrence that happens all to often.\n\n$Me - Client Devices Manager or Senior Dogsbody with around 10 years of experience in the company. My main role is managing our asset management system amongst other things. I rarely do Desktop Support calls anymore.  \n$SDE - Service Desk Engineer with around 1 years experience  \n$User - A Doctor. Enough said.\n\nSo I'm just getting on with my work when an email pops up telling me a call has been passed to me. A second later I get an IM from $SDE saying the ticket is for $User who is unable to log into an application, username and password incorrect even after a password reset, can I take a look.\n\nI have a couple of years working closely with this application so I'm more than happy to take a peek and see what is going on even though this is really something the engineers should be sorting.\n\nI pick up the phone and ring the extension $User has given. It rings 3 times and I clearly hear the handset the other side get picked up and put down. Click. Silence. Er... What, really.\n\nOK, so $User doesn't want to speak huh, fine. I'll try the old remote request and see if he clicks yes. After about 10 seconds of waiting, he lets me in. I type up a quick hello, I'm $Me and I'm going to look at your issue blah blah blah and set to work.\n\nI open up the web-link and immediately see the issue. This application is setup to work across multiple domains so one of the options is a \"Log on to\" box. I notice this is pointing to the 'default' location which is just a local database used only for administrators.\nI change the drop down to the correct setting - Something all users are trained to look out for - and get $User to try his credentials.\n\nStraight in.\n\n$User doesn't even leave a thank you note, just closes my messages and carries on working. 'Thank You very much' I think to myself.\n\nI close the remote window, update the call and let $SDE know exactly what I did. Time for more coffee.\n\nTLDR: $User cannot get into application even after password reset. All they had to do was change a drop down box to the right setting which they are trained to do in the first place.\n\nEdit: spelling.",

        "text": "Ok, so the other day I get an email from a customer saying that they have had a PCI scan from Lloyds bank and it's failed for having TLSv1 support. Fine, I usually just keep up with what ssllabs suggest as secure, but I've got no issue disabling TLSv1 if needed. But then it fails again for \"Weak Hashing Algorithm\".\nThe report includes the following quotes -\n\n\"Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual\nsunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.\"\n\n\"The following known CA certificates were part of the certificate\nchain sent by the remote host, but contain hashes that are considered\nto be weak.\"\n\nNow this is a simple LetsEncrypt cert on the server's default host, and the only cert with a SHA-1 signature is the trusted root. There's no website on this, just a page saying you must have typed something wrong basically. (These PCI scans always seem to check the default vhost and never actually report anything about the target site's own cert if you are using SNI)\n\nNow I start looking into this and come to the conclusion that A) The cert they are talking about was not \"sent by the remote host\"; The default configuration with LetsEncrypt just sends their intermediate and the site's cert. and B) There is no issue with a SHA-1 trusted root. Google's own blog on sunsetting SHA-1, whom they claim to be following, specifically mentions that trusted roots are not an issue. I then look at a few Google websites (who have their own CA and can create new certificates whenever they please) and see that they are still using a SHA-1 root themselves.\n\nOf course the real amusement comes when I realise that they are complaining about a SHA-1 root that expires in 2021, yet their entire online presence, including personal and commercial online banking for millions of customers, uses a SHA-1 root..., which doesn't expire until 2031... Hell, the website where you login to view the fact that you've failed PCI compliance has a SHA-1 root that doesn't expire for almost 20 years.\n\nEdit: Oh, and their online banking supports TLSv1 with weak ciphers according to ssllabs, probably for no better reason than they don't want to risk blocking customers with old devices.",

        "text": "Hi TFTS, \n\nA time ago, I used to build computers for people, and by the end of my tenure doing so, I had built perhaps 30 systems. \n\nThere are just two protagonists. $Me and $User. Simple. I now work in IT full time, but this was a little while before I started my new role. \n\nShould also say that there are little bits cut out here and there, in order to shorten the tale, otherwise it would have definitely gone into XL territory. \n\n***\n\nThis was a late 2017 project, and we had been in communication for about 2 weeks by the day of the build. I'll explain that - for the most part - I built the systems at the person's house, usually because they were interested in the process but too worried about breaking something to do it on their own. \n\nThe man in question had a lot to spend, and it was to be a top of the line video production PC. After deliberating, he decided on Intel's then new X299 'Skylake-X' lineup. I couldn't blame him, as he was a bit of a gamer and clearly had money to burn. \n\nSystem built, up and running, working sweet as a nut. I dialled in a very conservative overclock on the CPU (i7 7820X, for those wanting to know) using a 'safe' voltage, as well as enabling the XMP profiles on the memory. I also did the same to his GPU, a reference Nvidia GTX 1080Ti. \n\nI should say that for the clocks I used on the CPU, I did use a bit more core voltage than was necessary, but I wanted a buffer zone. This system was, I will say, solid as a rock.\n\nThis one... this was a doozy. \n\n***\n\nMy phone rings, it's 5:30pm on a Sunday, and whilst I made it clear I don't take Sunday calls, I recognised his number. We got along ok and I had helped him with a couple of questions he'd had in the past, so I didn't mind. \n\n* **$Me**: 'Hel...'\n* **$User**: 'It's dead. The PC is f**king dead. Just come fix it.' \n* **$Me**: 'Ok woah, what? How did it die?' \n* **$Use**r: 'I haven't got time (*classic line, that one*) to explain. Just please get over here. I have a project. \n\nI should note that I had given extensive advice about keeping backups on external drives, NAS(es), or using cloud based storage. I had also given VERY specific instructions not to f**k with anything in the BIOS. Ever. \n\nI will not bore you with the details, but I eventually got it out of him that the PC turned on, then immediately powered off, and there was a funny smell in the air. \n\nI get there to what can only be described as a human between the states of indescribable rage, and stricken panic. \n\n* **$User**: 'Thank god. How could this happen? It's not good enough. How can it just die? I paid you decent money for this.' \n* **$Me**: 'I understand, I do. However, please let me take a look first before we jump to any conclusions.'\n\n*Remain calm + be diplomatic. IT 101 right there.*\n\n* **$User**: 'Whatever. You built it, fix it.'\n\nI didn't say anything, but I was already really irked at his tone. Something, somewhere, told me that he wasn't being honest. \n\nI open the PC up, and I didn't even have to walk into the room to smell 'that' smell of burned electronics. We've all smelled it. I was about to start work when I noticed that the smell was coming directly from near the CPU socket... again, oh *very* dear indeed. \n\nOk, so immediately I think to myself 'Either this motherboard's power delivery is toast, or we're looking at a fried processor here.' In 2017, that is a very hard thing to do. Before I did anymore testing, time to get some more info...\n\n* **$Me**: 'I think I know what the problem is. Either the CPU or motherboard have burned out, judging by where the smell is coming from, and the symptoms seem to back that up. $User, did you do *anything* to the PC prior to shutting it down?' \n* **$User**: 'No, I shut it down last night. Went to turn it on before you came, and it did that. Just died. I thought you said this was stable?'  \n\nI didn't say anything. I knew the settings I used were entirely safe, so fault had to go down to hardware. \n\nI unmounted the significantly sized air cooler attached to the CPU, and could see no damage. Turned the PC around and still, no damage. Visible damage, anyway. Still the smell and symptoms were pretty conclusive. \n\nI did some more poking around. Tested the PSU with a paperclip, tested the memory in his living room PC, etc. It was all fine. \n\n* **$Me**:'$User, I hate to say it, but there is a very strong chance that either your CPU or motherboard are dead. Something has burned it out. Either a power surge here or too much power going through it...' \n\nSuddenly the user looked down at his feet, shifting a little. \n\n* **$Me**: '...Are you sure you didn't change anything?' \n* **$User**: 'Well I saw a video online about how to get more out of your system, so.' \n\nBoom. He could have said not a word more, and I would have put the rest together. My failing in this sorry endeavour was not to put an admin password on the UEFI.\n\n* **$Me**: 'Did you try and change the settings?'\n* **$User**: '...yes, I know you said you were very conservative for it to be more stable, but I wanted it to be faster.'\n* **$Me**: 'So you did what I said not to? What did you change?' \n* **$User**: 'Well I looked at a quick guide, and it said you had to raise voltage to raise the speed.'\n* **$Me**: 'What did you type in?' \n* **$User**: 'I thought it would be ok, as you said the cooler was very good, so I typed 1.8. I increased the speed, then did 'save and exit.' \n\nS**t. 1.8v. It's dead. At this point, he had calmed down a lot, and seemed to have accepted his fate. \n\n* **$Me**: '$User, there is very little chance the CPU has survived that, I will be honest with you. Your best hope is that the motherboard's power delivery array has survived, and that all you have lost is the CPU.' \n\nHe gulped, but said nothing. I think it was shock at his own idiocy. \n\n***\n\nThis tale ends ok, however. The CPU was confirmed dead when his new one worked fine. I made sure to scold him just enough so that the same would never happen again, and thanked my lucky stars that the end of my complimentary call/support service for builds was coming to an end. ",

We just need to be sure that the exported data from the work order system is accurately imported into the new version of the $AccountingSoftware.”\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “No, I want you to install this on a test server. I don’t think you understand how the invoicing system moves data to the $AccountingSoftware.”\n\n&gt;$Me: “Yeah, I’m pretty sure I do, actually. There is no magic happening on the server, because the $AccountingSoftware and the workorder system run on entirely different database systems and don’t magically talk to each other. You do a CSV export from one system via its client, and an import of that same CSV into the $AccountingSoftware client.”\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “So?”\n\n&gt;$Me: “Its a client-server system. The heavy lifting in this case is being done on the client computer, the data is just stored on the server system. You push data over from the workorder system to the accounting system with this CSV file that is saved out of the workorder system into a directory on the server, and you then import it using the $AccountingSoftware client. Its just a text file. No magic.”\n\n&lt;here comes the \"gotcha\" based on his flawed understanding of what the CSV import did&gt;\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “See! See! I knew you don’t understand. This file is *on the server*.”\n\n&gt;$Me: “The file could be anywhere:  floppy disk, a thumb drive, whatever. It doesn’t change the fact that its just a flat text file that gets saved out of the work order system and then gets imported into the $AccountingSoftware. In this case, you just happen to save it on a shared network drive that is on this server.”\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “Look, I just want to simulate the existing setup.”\n\n&gt;$Me: “OK, we can set these systems up on this old test server we have, and just run the client piece on the server, too.”\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “But that won’t be like it gets used normally. I want this to go over the network!”\n\n&gt;$Me: “The client pieces for both our workorder system and our $AccountingSoftware don’t care if they're running on the server or on a workstation. Its still doing the same thing when you open it and sign in. Its talking to its underlying database component.”\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “You still don’t understand how this works. THE DATA IS ON THE SERVER!!”\n\n&gt;$Me: “OK. Tell you what: To model this the way you want, I need a server-class machine to host the accounting system and workorder system’s databases on, and I need 2 workstations, so we can simulate our production network, using one PC for the workorder client and the other to run the accounting client.”\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: “We don’t have extra machines just laying around, you know!”\n\n&gt;$Me: \"To accurately emulate our production environment, we're going to need a 2nd server and 2 workstations. Delivered here by next week. You're looking at $3000, maybe $4000 to test this the way you want.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Well, maybe we can just test this using a regular old PC?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You mean like I installed it on last week? Like I just showed you just now?\"\n\nMind you: I could have taken an export from our production workorder system to simulate this. No, no, he demanded I actually *create a test instance* of the work order system on a *totally different machine* solely to generate the CSV from a \"test server.\" The CSV is the CSV, and its not going to change whether its one that the production system created or the test system created.  The only thing we're worried about in this test is that the updated version of the $AccountingSoftware would correctly take it and process the data fields like the older version did.  \n\nBut $BigBoss had it in his head that placing the file on the server gave it some magical properties and therefore it had to be “on a server” to be a legit test.  \n\nI'm inherently lazy, but especially as it pertained to things he asked me to do. I always had to find the non-convoluted, no-cost, don't waste too much effort method because chances are he was going to find a way to make it way more work than it needed to be, whether it was thru duplicated effort, or his poor understanding of how technology worked.",

        "text": "(this is a resubmit due to previous title gore. Thanks to the mods for sorting me out. Also, this is my first TFTS post, so, you know, be gentle.. LOL.)\n\n\nI worked for a small company that did phone systems, networks, wiring, that sort of thing. I managed part of the IT side of things (networks, servers, end user support) as well as internal IT. The owner, $BigBoss, was known for being very secretive and only doling out what he felt was the absolute minimum information necessary to do something. Unfortunately, what he *thought* was the minimum necessary and what was *actually* necessary were usually two entirely different things.  \n\nOne day, the $BigBoss emails me with a request:\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"I need you to order two laptops.\"\n\nThe back and forth goes more or less like this:\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, what are the specs?\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"They need to be just like the last two laptops we picked up for the field techs.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Got it, That shouldn't be too hard. What are these being used for?\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"It doesn't matter. Just get two laptops like we got last time. Nothing fancy.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK.\"\n\n(Note: \"It doesn't matter\" was always $BigBoss's way of ending a conversation. It was code for \"Don't ask me anymore questions that I don't want to tell you,\" so we all knew that when he said something like this it was fruitless to continue asking questions. At this point, do what he's asking.)\n\nI go to our usual hardware vendor, get the current price on two Dell Inspirons. The same model number we purchased a few months before isn't available, so I get the equivalent current model quote and and email it to him.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Here you go, $BigBoss. This is the quote for the same spec we got before. They don't have that prior model in stock, so this is the current one. Same screen size, CPU, RAM, hard disk, wifi, etc...\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"These are more expensive than the other ones!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"They're the current model units.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"I don't accept that technology gets more expensive. Why are these more expensive than the old ones?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No idea, chief. Could be that the ones we got before were reduced at that moment to clear them out of the warehouse to make way for the current model. Also, we're paying a premium for Windows 7 Pro machines now because Microsoft is damn near giving away Windows 8 to OEMs to try to improve the adoption rate.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Alright, whatever. Just get them here as quick as you can.\"\n\nThey arrive the next week and I email $BigBoss:\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Ok, those laptops are here. Do you want me to have $Tech set them up on the network for a field tech or a user?\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"No, just bring them both to me. I'll set them up.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK.\"\n\nOver the next week, I see him and our $InfrastructureManager puzzling over these computers in his office. I'm able to put together that they wanted these PCs to do on-premise wireless network surveys using some fairly high end wireless survey software and a combination of the internal Wifi and an external USB wifi adapter (actually two different wifi adapters, one on each band). \n\nThe $InfrastructureManager and I are pretty tight, so I ask him when $BigBoss isn't around \"Whats the deal with these two laptops?\"\n\n&gt;\"$BigBoss wants to do a wireless survey at $BigGovtCustomer, so he bought this software without talking to anybody and he can't seem to get it to work with the laptops.\"\n\n&gt;\"Oh boy.\"\n\nEventually, I get the hot-button from $BigBoss and I meet him in his office with $InfrastrureManager and the two laptops, one of which is on a cart with this wireless contraption velcro'd to the lid.\n\n&gt;\"$ITCustodian, something is wrong with these laptops you got.\"\n\n&gt;\"What do you mean, $BigBoss?\"\n\n&gt;\"They don't work.\"\n\n&gt;\"In what way?\"\n\n&gt;\"The wireless won't work with this $Software. These laptops are shit.\"\n\n&gt;\"Thats odd. Whats the $Software?\"\n\n$BigBoss rattles off the name of the high-end wireless survey software. I'm familiar with it, kind of. Its the same company makes the certification meters we use for our wiring.  Seems the sales guys for $Software twisted $BigBoss's arm to buy this as \"Just like the meters you use now\" kind of thing. So he dropped like $5K on this software on the sale guy's say-so without talking to a soul in the company.  (Never mind that you can get Acrylic, even the most expensive license for heatmapping, for less than half of what he paid for this)\n\n&gt;\"OK, $BigBoss. Give me a minute and let me do a little research.\"\n\nI go back to my hovel and call up the website for $Software and look at the software specs.  \n\nSure enough, $Software only works with like a half-dozen narrowly defined Wifi chipsets, none of which are in these laptops. Because when we get a laptop for a tech we usually get the cheap-ass, low-end version with the \"basic\" wifi. Otherwise, $BigBoss throws a fit about the price. \n\nIf $BigBoss had given me a legit spec or told me the application it was intended for in the first place, before I quoted him the laptops, we'd have gotten the right laptops with the correct chipset that works with $Software the first time. But like I said, he thinks everything has to be a big secret with the end result being we wind up doing more work and spending more money.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$BigBoss, the problem is that the wifi chipsets in these laptops are not capable of working with $Software\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"I don't accept that. Wifi is wifi.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Be that as it may, its right here on the $Software specs what chipsets it supports. And those aren't in these laptops.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Why did you buy the wrong laptops?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (trying hard to control my tone) \"You asked for laptops like we get the techs, $BigBoss. I ordered up the current model laptops meeting the same specs as the ones we've previous gotten for the techs. If I had known that we had to get a specific wifi chipset model to work with $Software, I'd have specified those.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Can't you just swap out the chipset? Its 2015. This can't be hard.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"It doesn't work that way. We'd have to disassemble the laptop and get the new wifi cards, and there's no guarantee it would work, and it would likely void the warranty.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Whats the solution?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"We need to return those two laptops, pay the restocking fee, and get two that meet the specs of the software. Here's the quote from the vendor for two machines that meet that spec.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"This is stupid! These laptops are over $1000 each!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yep, thats what the higher end systems with the better wifi cost.\"\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"I want more quotes.\"\n\nI go back to my vendor and get two more quotes for HP &amp; Lenovo laptops. Which were in the same price range. $BigBoss dismissed those quotes with a wave of his hand.\n\n&gt;$BigBoss: \"Go get the original two you quoted. And don't make this mistake again.\"\n\n&gt;$Me (to myself): \"The mistake I made was taking a job here.\"\n\nIn all, they wasted almost two weeks fiddling around with laptops that didn't meet the spec, due to the $BigBoss being a chowderhead about communication.\n\nThe new laptops worked correctly with the software, as expected. But then $BigBoss refused to do anything but the free YouTube training for the $Software, so he and $InfrastructureManager spent another couple weeks fooling with it in the office trying to figure out how to do a legit wireless survey with it.  $Software had in-person training, but $BigBoss wasn't about to spend $2000 for that. Heck, $Software would have actually done the wireless survey for us if we'd asked, I think.  \n\nMeanwhile, I sat thru two webinars from two different wifi hardware vendors and got some solid info about wifi placement, signal strengths, etc. Real actionable, realworld stuff.\n\n$BigBoss and $InfrastructureManager went to $BigGovtCustomer site, did the survey in the most bassackward and labor intensive fashion they could and produced incomprehensible heat maps and diagrams that didn't make sense. Using this weird data (and, I think, a dartboard) $BigBoss proposed a wifi solution to the $BigGovtCustomer that was probably twice the amount of wiring and access points than they actually needed. He took $WifiManufacturer's specs, refused to believe them or the industry standards on signal strength and RSSI values, ignored the best practices for channelization in 2.4 &amp; 5ghz spectrums, and put access points in places that made no sense for user densities and building coverage. \n\nWe promptly lost the business to $BigWifiVendor who proposed a far simpler solution that cost about half as much, had half as many access points and leveraged existing wiring.\n\nI left that company a few months later, and while I have a whole bunch of different challenges, $BigBoss and his lack of communication and \"blame everybody else\" attitude isn't among them anymore.

        "text": "Please excuse any formatting, all mistakes are mine.\n\nBG: I work for an online testing company. Basically our clients create exams and we provide a place for the testers to take those exams and watch to make sure there isn't any cheating and help them out if the test locks up.  \n\nThere's a whole process to setting up for the exam.  A lot of the clients choose to make the testers go through an identification process.  This particular woman, whom we shall call **Nameless** for reasons that will become clear, was required to set up keystrokes and have a clear photo on file.  *Note: she had already finished the original setup but was having issues getting into the exam.  This conversation takes place over 2-3 chats, no idea why she didn't call directly.*\n\nIn all fairness to **Nameless**, the client she was going through does not have the easiest process and it adds some extra frustration.\n\n1. A private sign-on that links to ours that generates a random login at least 20 characters long\n\n2. The sign-on is through a different company and none of the testers know the name\n\n3. This is for a government department and your guess is as good as mine about the current computers and software in general use\n\n\nThe first chat was pretty standard.  Nameless was having trouble getting past the photo recognition but didn't see an option to reset it.  I checked the photo (pretty blurry), verified her details and reset it and made sure she still had time to get into her exam.  She thanked me and went off to do the new photo. \n\nA new chat opens:\n\n&gt;*(Usual opening script here)*\n\n&gt;**Nameless**: I can't get into my exam, the keystrokes aren't working.\n\n&gt;**Me**: Let me pull up your account. What's happening when you type your name?\n\n&gt;**Nameless**:  I try and it locks me out after three tries.\n\n&gt;**Me**: Please try again while you're on chat with me. Remember that you can't use Caps Lock, only Shift.\n\n&gt;**Nameless**: Oh, that might be it. \n\n&gt;**Nameless**: I still can't get in.\n\n&gt;**Me**: Please verify the details for me and I'll reset it.  When you type try to use a steady rhythm since we do tend to type faster since we know our names.\n\n&gt;**Me**: Then try to start again. I checked and your exam is still open.\n\n&gt;**Nameless** (but not!): She's typing it in but it's still not going through.  \n\n&gt;**Me**: (*thinking what on earth and notice there's a man on the edge of the new profile picture, best guess is the local IT*)  Remember you can't use Caps Lock. Keep typing at a steady pace. \n\n&gt;**Nameless** (but not!): Yes, that was the problem the first time but it keeps logging her out.\n\n&gt;**Me**: (*Dude, you know as well as I do that is she can't type her own name this is not my fault.*)  I will reset the keystrokes again and reschedule.  Please remember you can call us directly if you're still stuck.\n\n&gt;*session times out*\n\n5 minutes later\n&gt;**Nameless**:  I still can't get in.\n\n&gt;**Me**: We can reset it or have you try to launch again.\n\n&gt;**Nameless**: Let's reset it and I'll try one more time\n\nShe never did get in, I cancelled the exam and sent her back to switch to a different form of the exam where she could go to a preset location.  The really strange thing is that she must have almost been in the first time because they have to pass keystrokes before getting to the photo. \n\nTL;DR - User cannot type her own name even after having it reset multiple times.  \n\n*Thanks for the formatting tips and the clarifying questions!*\n",

An elderly woman came in today and I greeted her in my usual upbeat, happy tone, but as soon as she looked up I could tell she was visibly distraught. I asked her what the problem was, and she held up an iPhone 7, missing the SIM card tray, but I could see that a SIM card was jammed into the phone.\n\nThe phone powered on, but wouldn't boot properly, and I told her it was probably a simple fix, that I just needed her to sign a paper authorizing me to take her device back to my desk.\n\nShe's so upset that she can hardly speak, instead handing me driver's license to enter her name into the computer. I tell her to sit down in our lobby and relax, because it won't be long. She hands me a SIM card that she wants to go in the phone, and the SIM card tray. The Apple Store apparently told her she would simply need to get a new phone, and the sales rep at her carrier store (who supposedly inserted the SIM card without the tray) refused to attempt fixing it.\n\nI take the phone back to my desk, open it up, disconnect the battery and display cables, then peel back the cover of the SIM card slot. I push the SIM card out, put in the SIM tray holding the new one, then reassemble her phone. Takes all of five minutes.\n\nI turn her phone on and it boots properly, then I go out to the lobby, sit down next to her, and hand her the working phone. She breathes an enormous sigh of relief and asks me how much for the service; I tell her that because I was able to fix the device in such a short period requiring no parts, that there's no charges due.\n\nShe profusely thanks me, asks if she can have a hug, to which of course I say yes. She signs our paperwork stating that she picked up her device, and left the shop much happier than when she came in.\n\nNothing major, but a nice reminder about why I go to work everyday; because lots of people actually do care about their devices, for whatever reason, and it's not just idiots owning things with a power button.",

        "text": "So a little background, I used to work in a computer shop doing the usual building and repairing of computers.\n\n$Me: Yours truly\n\n$Cx: Customer\n\nSo I had finished building his pc and tested it, everything seems normal customer picks up their Pc that night. \n\nI come into work the next day and right at opening he's there. His PC wasn't able to boot into windows. Plop it on my test bench and it works just fine. I notice that in the BIOS the USB port is first in the order. Odd, we normally swap the HDD to be the first thing to boot, but whatever, I change it back. I ask him if he had a printer connected and sure enough he did. I explain that printers can sometimes cause the computer not to boot if it's connected over USB and that it should be fine now.\n\nCustomer goes home everything is happy. I get a call about 4 hours later. Same guy his computer isn't working. Hmmmm\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Is the printer plugged in again?\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"Yeah\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Ok, try unplugging it\"\n\nIt works. Ok, so maybe the setting didn't save in the BIOS.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Ok, I think it might be the printer but I'd like to have you bring in the PC once more to double check.\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"Alright\"\n\nSo I open up the BIOS and sure enough USB is the first boot option. I move it down the list and save it. Reboot to double check and call it good.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"It looks like that setting didn't save for some reason, but it should be fine now\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"It better be. I'm getting sick of coming here for my computer.\"\n\nEnd of story, right? NOPE! Next morning I come in and the customer is looking pissed. Ok, let's check it out. I see that setting is changed again. I know it saved properly, and so I'm a little suspicious.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Have you been changing this setting by any chance?\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"Oh yeah, the guide I have for new computers says to do that.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well if that setting's first it won't boot if your printer is plugged in. Is there a USB that you're trying to boot from?\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"Nope it just says to do that in the guide.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Ok, well don't do that. It's going to cause your computer not to boot. Just skip that step.\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"Well this guide is written by a professional\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I'm sure. But I'm telling you this is what's causing it\"\n\nCustomer leaves and I figure everything is hunky-dory. Customer learned something, I solved a mystery, and we're good to go. Then I come back from my lunch to see him back in once more. Shit.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did something else pop up?\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"It's doing the same thing!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did you change the setting again?\"\n\n&gt;$Cx: \"It said to in the guide.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Ok hold on, I was reading on this after you left and I think I found a solution.\"\n\nI took the PC into the back. Went into the BIOS and just put a BIOS password on it. Saved it in the notes on the customer and sent him on his way. I never heard back from him.",

        "text": "This week has been a goldmine. Okay, need to try to explain this one in a way that doesn't identify where I work, so here goes...    \n\nI'm the system administrator at a medium sized company - roughly 125 or so employees. Mainly a Windows admin, but you guys &amp; gals know how that goes. If it plugs into a wall and/or phone line and/or has batteries - it's IT's problem.    \n\nSaid company shares a name with a commonly used English word (hereafter \"COMPANY\"), and is hosting an event that also shares its name with a commonly used English word (hereafter \"EVENT\"). To make this worse if you combine COMPANY and EVENT into \"COMPANY EVENT\" - together they also signify a completely unrelated (to our line of work anyway) product. I hope that makes sense...    \n\nCut to this morning, when one of the bigwigs calls my department cell and says, \"One of my buddies just told me that when he Googled COMPANY EVENT we didn't show up on the first page, he just got a list of things to purchase, we need to fix that.\" Thankfully this went into my voicemail as I was on another call, so I didn't need to immediately respond (and he couldn't hear my brain going WTF through the phone).    \n\nIgnoring the fact that SEO would definitely fall more clearly under the job description of our communications staffer - I knew I was going to have to get this jackalope some sort of response. A response beyond, \"No, I can't just call and/or email somebody at Google and tell them how important you think this event is.\"    \n\nSo, off to Google I went, where I discovered that if you searched for \"COMPANY COMPANY EVENT\" instead of \"COMPANY EVENT\" - we actually were the third result. Which I thought was pretty good for something that (seriously) no more than 35 people will attend. Ran my planned response past my immediate supervisor and the comms staffer quick, and called the bigwig back (also, thankfully, straight to voicemail).    \n\nThen tried to figure out how the hell I ended up here. It's Friday friends, enjoy it...    \n\nTLDR: Bigwig doesn't know how to Google, and apparently that's tech support's fault.",

        "text": "For starters, I am not in IT. I know enough about computers to be Family IT^^TM and my family is great at basic troubleshooting. My MIL often goes far beyond to the point she's performed the same steps I would have. The stories on this sub have provided hours of entertainment and I've thanked my lucky stars that my family and coworkers are not worthy of this sub. Unfortunately, I was wrong on the latter group.\n\nSome important background before I get into the story: a majority of my coworkers are engineers or some form of higher degree, often making me feel like the dumbest person in the building. We all probably spend 3/4 of our time on computers to perform our duties. More importantly, my company is going through a huge initiative to upgrade all systems we use which include upgrades to Windows 10 and Office 365 as well as new workstations for everybody. Naturally, this takes a massive amount of effort when you have to upgrade over 6,000 users across several states.\n\nCorporate has been very communicative through this process as our switchover is in less than a month. For the past year we have had newsletters, email blasts, web training, and face-to-face training for the systems already updated. Personally, this all seems like overkill as I don't need a 30 minute training on a slightly different UI home screen we've been using for years. And since my coworkers seem to be Sam's robot (bash story 240849) it's a wasted effort.\n\nLate-2017 was the first stage of the upgrades where we merged from Outlook 2010 to 2016 and from Lync to Skype for Business. Step-by-step instructions were emailed to everybody and meetings were performed the day before to guide everybody through the process. The look of panic on the faces in the room regarding the login process made me lose some hope for humanity. My boss was one of the worst asking questions what were embarrassing. She was worried about losing all of her IE bookmarks despite this have nothing to do with IE (and we are allowed to use Chrome...). Eventually, I told her that everything will be fine and I'll walk her through the process in the morning so the meeting could continue. She filled up 3 pages with notes despite the multiple guides we were given. Then again, she double-clicks links and uses Comic Sans exclusively.\n\nThe following morning I finish the process in about 5 minutes and let Outlook do it's thing migrating all of my emails. While getting coffee, I hear a shriek down the hall. Ah, the boss is in.\n\n&gt;Me: Good morning, Bo--\n\n&gt;Boss, in a panic: Where are all my emails?! Everything is gone?!\n\n&gt;Me, walking around to her computer: You have the old Outlook open. Close it and go to the new one. It's the blue icon with the white \"O\".\n\n&gt;Boss: This is such a pain. I better not lose my emails. I have so many important things in there.\n\nShe eventually locates the correct icon and locks up when the login screen appears. After 10 minutes and finally convincing her it's the same login she uses for EVERYTHING else (\"But that's not what my notes say!\") we get in.\n\n&gt;Boss: SEE?! ALL OF MY EMAILS ARE GONE!!!\n\n&gt;Me: *sigh* This is what they explained yesterday. It could take up to 30 minutes to get everything. Let's move on to the Skype setup. First we need to open Lyn--\n\n&gt;Boss: *finds Skype and opens it like Usain Bolt with a mouse, error popup* What is this all about?! I need this to work!\n\n&gt;Me: We need to stop Lync from conflicting with it first. Go ahead and hit CTRL+SHIFT+E--\n\n&gt;Boss: *CTRL+ALT+DEL* Now what?\n\n&gt;Me: *sigh* Start Task Manager. Go to the Processes tab. We need to close the Skype process--No! Not Lync! (she ends Lync) Okay... Now end the Skype process. (ends Skype) Lets keep the Task Manager open because we'll need it again in a moment and open Lync.\n\n&gt;Boss: *hits red \"X\" on TM then opens Lync* \n\n&gt;Me: *guides her through preventing Lync starting on boot which went surprisingly smoothly* Now we need to stop the Lync process again, so hit CTRL+SHIFT--I mean, CTRL+ALT+DEL. Now Start Task Manager... Processes... Now end Lync.\n\n&gt;Boss: But I just did that! Why do I have to do it again?! \n\nRepeat the same login woes with Skype and we're back to her email which is still migrating and more complaints that her emails are missing. With my patience nearing negative levels, I tell her to wait a couple hours and if things are still missing to call IT. I returned to my desk where I strongly considered going home sick and drinking enough to justify \"being sick\". \n\nShe was not the only person I had to help during that week, but she was the worst. The next updates are more significant and I can already feel my sanity slipping away with the ridiculous questions being asked. If my account goes inactive in the next few weeks, know I am probably safe in a padded room at a secure facility. ",

Of course I will pay for his time and stay.\n\n$me: We are also offering online trainings, which can teach you employees, how to use $Functions. Maybe this could be something for you?\n\n$C: No I don’t want something like this, because you always forget things after two or three days after the training. I want someone, who has experience in the use of the $Program and $Functions.\n\n$me: So you want us form $Company to ask our customers, if they are willing to borrow you an employee, to train your employees in $Program?\n\n$C : Exactly.\n\n$me : I can’t promise you that this will work, but I will asked at least.\n\n\nSo I made a ticket with his request and send it to another queue and I made sure that I cant be understood as a joke.

        "text": "How many times have we been asked this question?\r\n\r\nHow many times are we the ones responsible?\r\n\r\n\"too many\" is the answer to both the above.\r\n\r\nThis is me, outing myself some decade and a half later :)\r\n\r\n**Backstory**\r\n\r\nThis was in $Job-2 (I posted a comment elsewhere where I called it \"$Job-1\" - but it wasn't, sorry - not that it matters all that much).\r\n\r\nIn this place I had been thrown in the deep end as the network and systems admin. My predecessor decided on a whim to leave the country and fly back to his home country (perhaps a woman, don't know, doesn't matter). The sum total of the documentation he handed me was a Post-It^(tm) Note with the passwords on it, and not much more.\r\n\r\nYes, this is the same place that, about 2 years later I was \"let go\" and handed all the doco and passwords to a manager. I left the place in a much better situation than when it was handed to me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to this story.\r\n\r\n**The 'glitch'**\r\n\r\nUp until about 2000-ish, we were connected to our \"home base\" in Europe (Benelux region) via a slow Frame Relay link. This meant that all our interactions with the Internet was via Europe. We were an Internet Banking software development company, and our customers were here in the antipodes. So, to connect to them, we went half way round the world to Europe, and then back. Local sites (smh.com.au, nzherald.co.nz, etc) were somewhat, um, slow. Accessing our customer sites here was also slow.\r\n\r\nAnd this link was damn expensive to boot!\r\n\r\nI did some research, and found an In-Building Ethernet (IBE) connection for about 1/4 of the cost of the FR, and running at 2Mbps in each direction (blazingly quick for the day!)\r\n\r\nOne advantage of the FR link was that the parent company looked after the firewalling - to use the IBE, I would have to do that. So, a spare machine, a copy of \"Building Internet Firewalls\" and \"Securing and Optimizing Linux\" and a copy of a commercial firewall product from the Middle East, I set about building that.\r\n\r\nIt took about two weeks. I built it, tested it, and rebuilt it to make sure I had the process \"right\". Testing was fun - two whole megabits to myself ;)\r\n\r\nBut I digress.\r\n\r\nAfter we finally had the cutover to the new local Internet connection, things flowed much more smoothly (too smoothly - topic for another short story).\r\n\r\nOne morning, about a month in with the new system, and everyone is used to the near instant response from their favourite news-sites (oh, and I guess the local customer's sites too ;) , I'm working away in the server cupboard, and go to switch to one of the windows server (2000! all the latest mod-cons!) machines via a KVM (Keyboard/Video/Mouse) switch. I hit the button on the KVM for the WinServer, and hit the three-fingered-salute on the keyboard. The screen lights up with a lot of scrolling text telling me all these daemons are being shut down.\r\n\r\nGuess who forgot to defang the vulcan-nerve-pinch in iniitab(5)?\r\n\r\nI knew there was nothing I could do to stop the firewall from going down, so I hit the KVM switch a bit harder, control-alt-deleted into the Windows server and made busy.\r\n\r\nLess than a minute later someone knocks at the door \"is the Internet down?\" Um, \"I don't know,\" (I lie) \"I will have a look after I finish this thing for &amp;lt;manager&amp;gt; on this Windows box\". And they leave.\r\n\r\nA few moment later the BIOS POST 'beep' issues from the Linux firewall, and it proceeds to come back up.\r\n\r\nI finished with the Windows server, and the very next thing I did was log on the Linux box, vim into inittab and change \r\n\r\n    ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t5 -rf now\r\n\r\nto something like \r\n\r\n    ca::ctrlaltdel:echo \"\\aouch! don't do that!\" \r\n(the \"\\a\" rings the bell / beeps / plays the 'alert' sound)\r\n\r\nand then issued a\r\n\r\n    #telinint q\r\n\r\nto reread the inittab file. No, I didn't test my changes.\r\n\r\nThe user popped back a minute or so later to tell me that the Internet was back up. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, good. must have been a glitch or something.\"\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nedit: add tl;dr (and tweak same)\r\n\r\ntl;dr - where our hero lies his way out of a sticky situation caught out rebooting the internet connection",

        "text": "This tale is a recent tale...it happened on my first day of my current job in IT. I was \"warned\" beforehand that there would be a lot of hand-holding when it comes to tech as a majority of the employees are of the older generation and they've spent most of their career without technology so all this tech that they're using now can be a bit overwhelming for them. No worries, that's what I'm there for.\n\nSo, like I said, first day on the new gig and my first issue that comes up. Nice enough lady...she comes to track me down, introduces herself, and then proceeds to explain how her laptop isn't turning on and that she has everything plugged in. I go to investigate.\n\nI see a workstation-sized laptop sitting on her desk with a seemingly rat's nest of cabling coming out of both sides. I start tracing out cables to see what's what...I see the VGA and HDMI cables going to the 2 monitors, the USB cables going to the keyboard, mouse, USB hub, and printer...but I don't seem to see any cord for a power supply. Thinking I may have missed the power connection, I double check the connections for some different type of connector I may be unaware of, and then ask her if she's got the power supply available.\n\nShe says, \"Oh, yeah...it's in my bag. Do I need that?\" I explain how the battery probably doesn't have any charge so that's why it isn't powering up. She plugs up the power supply and voila, it turns on. She laughs and apologizes and says she thought it had some charge on it before she left the house that morning, etc.\n\nA week or so later she asked me about how she could clean up the cables and I suggested a docking station. She got one last week, we hooked it up, and she's much happier that her desk now lacks the clutter of all the cabling.",

        "text": "I work at a company that supports POS software.\n\nThe other day, a young woman calls in from one of the companies we support. She's seeing some weirdness with the payment area that's preventing her from processing sales correctly, so I remote in to have a look. Doesn't take me long to realize that this particular software wonkiness is pretty familiar. We'll call her clueless.\n\n**Me:** Okay, could I have you log out and back into the software, please?\n\n**Clueless:** Oh, wait, what?\n\n**Me:** I'd like to see if logging out and back in will take care of [issue with payments screen].\n\n**Clueless:** Oh. Well...I've never done that before. How do I do that?\n\n**Me:**.....You'd go up to the top of the screen here and click on Log Out. *moves cursor to button*\n\nShe does so, and logs back in. Once done, we hop back into the payment area. The issue's gone.\n\n**Clueless:** *disdainfully* Well, that's really stupid. You shouldn't have to completely log out in the middle of working just to fix something like that. Is there a reason why it has to be that way? This happens to me several times a week.\n\n**Me:** It's kind of like giving the software a refresher. It's been holding on to a lot of information while you've been working, so it's good to log out and back in at least once a day to get rid of what's in the cache and any other temporary data. (I'm bad at explaining like people are five.)\n\n**Clueless:** Oh, I've never had to log out before. We set it up so that the system doesn't quit out on us or go black while we're working. Do we really have to log out now to make things work?\n\n*facedesk*\n\nNow, I had noticed something when she was testing a sale after we logged her out. She went to a customer's record, copied something, and went back to the payment area. I went back later after the call because I was curious (and because I needed the account ID for notes).\n\nThere, in a little marked note field, was the customer's full credit card number.\n\nAPPARENTLY, this company does not like having credit card tokenization (where any card entered into the system for payments and whatnot is saved, but you can't access the first twelve digits and the CVV), so they take customers' actual credit card numbers, CVVs, names, and expiration dates and just keep them in a little note field on the customer's account in the POS. For anyone to grab. Fun times. \n\nI freaked out a bit and brought it to my manager, who informed me sadly that she's spoken with them before about it on many occasions, but nothing has ever changed and they almost seemed offended that it was even brought up as a bad idea. \n\nTL;DR: Company has set up their POS software so that no one is ever logged out of the software or Windows, and also keeps their customers' full credit card information in a little note box on their customer record. I guess it's only a matter of time before some disgruntled ex-employee goes on an Amazon shopping spree.",

        "text": "This is a doozie, so early TL;DR: Former programmer turned HMFIC tells me PC's aren't set up properly for reports his program generates; he updates said program because it was set to run wrong version of Excel.\n\nHere's a little background info: Our HMFIC started out when the company started up as a programmer (I decline to use the term \"software developer\" out of respect for software developers) and he wrote a few very simple apps for inventory management, S &amp; R, accounting, and HR. The business exploded and they had to actually hire a team of software developers (my manager ($MANAGER) being the first, a very talented and outstanding developer) and systems engineers to deal with the rapid growth. Programmer at the time ($HMFIC) instantly became VP but maintained and developed a system for building services written in VB 3. The program is an absolute mess from a coding standpoint and is the complete opposite of user friendly; in fact, it drives users to insanity when they need to use it. This system was and still is under the management of programmer turned VP turned HMFIC and is still being developed by $HMFIC. $MANAGER has no say in how it's developed or maintained.\n\nAll of our PC's are built from two reference images (one with Office 2016-ProPlus from O365 for O365-E3 licensed users and the other with Office 2013-Pro for O365-E1 licensed users. They are deployed using WMS and MDT. Prior to deploying them, I tested the images, then I had management test them to be sure all the programs functioned as they should, OCX, DLL, and VBX controls all registered. Both passed inspection and were approved for deployment.\n\nFast forward to today's ticket: Register OCX controls on user's PC. Crashes whenever reports are run in *$HMFICPROGRAM*.\n\nI spoke with my manager:\n\n$ME: This makes no sense, all PCs have these controls registered.\n\n$MANAGER: There's probably something missing on that particular PC. Go register *$control1* and *$control2* and see what happens.\n\nI go register them and the reports still crash. I search for other controls and register those as well with no luck. By this time, my list of notes on the ticket has reached 15.\n\nThe production manager ($PRMGR) steps in.\n\n$PRMGR: What's going on?\n\n$USER: $HMFICPROGRAM keeps crashing now whenever I run it.\n\n$PRMGR: Why's it doing that now? It ran fine yesterday, right?\n\n$USER: Yup.\n\n*screeeeeeech*\n\n$ME: Wait, it worked yesterday?\n\n$USER: Yup\n\n$PRMGR: $HMFIC added something to it and it works fine on my PC. Also on $USER2 and $USER3's computers.\n\n*screeeeeeeeeeeeeech*\n\nThe list of notes on the ticket is now at 35, all machines are running the same version of $HMFICPROGRAM and now all we have are symptoms with no bread crumb trail or anything.\n\n$ME to $PRMGR: (fed up with the \"mine works, theirs doesn't, fix it crap) Come show me.\n\nWe take the walk back to his office.\n\n$ME: Ok, now show me how this thing is supposed to work.\n\n$PRMGR: (does the thing and it works) See? I get my Excel file so I can check and update the reports.\n\n*internal cursing and swearing intensifies*\n\n$ME: Can I see what version of Office you're running?\n\n$PRMGR: Sure. (shows me he's running Office 2016 ProPlus)\n\n$ME: Ok, who else can run this?\n\n$PRMGR rattles off a list of people who all have Office 2016 ProPlus on their PCs.\n\n*LIGHT BULB GOES ON*\n\n$ME: Ok, those machines on the floor all run Office 2013. For whatever reason, the changes that were made are not compatible with Office 2013.\n\n$PRMGR: (eyes suddenly get very large and red) So you're telling me you're going to have to reinstall Office on ALL THOSE COMPUTERS?\n\n*internal facepalm*\n\n$ME: No, it just means that whatever changes were made to the $HMFICPROGRAM are only usable on Office 2016 computers. We'll have to look at the program to fix it.\n\nI head up to my manager's office, who has been a software developer since he was a teenager, and has about 20 years with this company.\n\n$MANAGER: How's it coming?\n\n$ME: I finally found some bread crumbs. $HMFICPROGRAM reports only work on computers with Office 2016, however it worked just fine yesterday for everyone.\n\n$MANAGER: It was fine YESTERDAY?\n\n$ME: Yup. That's what everyone is saying.\n\n$MANAGER: (looking up at the ceiling thinking, then I hear his internal facepalm) Dammit, $HMFIC needs to stop and leave this to us.\n\nWe walk to various users verifying the version of Office vs how $HMFICPROGRAM performs, and $MANAGER confirms it's a problem with the program. We head to $HMFIC's office.\n\n$MANAGER: $HMFIC, what handler are you using for $HMFICPROGRAM reports?\n\n$HMFIC: Excel, of course. What else would I be using? (sarcastically)\n\n$MANAGER: You really need to be using the handler that we've been using for years that's out on the $NETWORKSHARE. Because when Office versions change, their OLE functionality changes, so we've been using this handler since we built all the systems. That way we maintain consistency.\n\n$HMFIC: (angrily) What the hell difference is that gonna make? All the PCs are set up wrong because the reports don't launch in Excel!!\n\n$MANAGER: They do on yours, right?\n\n$HMFIC: Yeah, but (loooooong pause)...we have PCs that run other versions of Office?\n\n$MANAGER: Yup.\n\nAt this point I'm up to 60 notes on the ticket.\n\n$HMFIC: Ah, sh--!, that's right. Dammit.\n\n$HMFIC then reopens the code, changes the handler to the correct one, compiles it, tests it, and deploys to the masses.\n\nI went around and verified that all the PCs with Office 2016 and Office 2013 could run their reports, and they could. All was well and I close the ticket with 75 notes on it.\n\n*alcoholism intensifies*\n\nEDIT: clarification of seniority of $MANAGER",

        "text": "It started out as a normal day, just typical issues like a password reset here or there or some minor issues with some of the applications we use.  \n  \nFor some background, where I work we do a lot of different financial services for our clients. Clients range from individuals, to corporations. I can't say too much, but if it involves money and financing we have a service to sell.  \n  \nAnyways, my department is internal only. We do not support clients because we do not provide that type of service to our clients. It's **extremely** rare we ever have to communicate with a client, let alone have one call our internal help desk line.  \n  \nFor this story **$me** will of course be yours truly and our client is **$Ziplord**  \n  \nA ticket was generated by a message left on our voicemail stating a client needed help downloading a file. I had the ticket and after about 45 minutes as I was wrapping up a major issue I try to establish first contact.  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$Me**: Hello is this $Ziplord? I received a message from you requesting assistance with downloading a file we sent you?\n\n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Yes this is Ziplord, I'm okay I'm being helped already with this.\n\n&gt;**$Me**: *(Noticing he called in while I was away from my desk a few moments ago I can see my colleague picked up the call that came in and just hadn't grabbed it from my queue yet)* Okay sir not a problem. Have a great day.  \n  \n  \nWe part ways, my gut gave me a bad feeling, but I had other things to worry about and it's not our fault that our client is too cheap to hire his own IT (checking his file real quick he owns several businesses).  \n  \nI go about my merry way when 30 minutes later I notice the guy calls back 4 times in a row. At this point my colleague that was assisting him was in the middle of another issue so I gladly took the reigns, and the client left an additional voicemail asking us to call him back.  \n  \nI quickly IM the non-IT staff member involved with the guy's account to try to figure out what he was having trouble downloading, and I was forwarned through lengthy IM's that this guy is a **lunatic** and the problem is him.  \nI take a swig of water, sign out of the queue and advise the team and my manager, and prep for the worst.  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$Me**: This is $Company Help Desk, $Me speaking.  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Yes I need help downloading my 5 files. I download them and I want to read them, but they're a ZIP file. I don't care what a zip file is and I don't need a zip file. I just need my damn documents!  \n&gt;**$Me**: Okay sir, that Zip file you're downloading has-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: I told you I DON'T WANT THE ZIP FILE.  \n&gt;**$Me**: *(Screams Internally)* I understand sir, but that zip file contains -  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: I DON'T WANT THE ZIP FILE!!!!!  \n&gt;**$Me**: Sir, if you'd -  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Why can't this just work!?  \n&gt;**$Me**: You just need to-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: These files, I should be able to read them but I can't I get this stupid zip file and it goes to my downloads folder! Why would I want it in my downloads folder it's a DOCUMENT!  \n&gt;**$Me**: *(Holding my shit together)* By default the downloads will go to your downloads folder, you can move the files after you download-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS? IT SHOULD JUST WORK!  \n&gt;**$Me**: Look, that's the way your Internet Browser is configured, I just want to help you get these documents. Let's just work together and get this downloaded for you. Just follow what I say step-by-step and it'll be okay.  \n  \n  \nA moment of silence goes by as I can feel **$Ziplord** brimming with anger at his own ineptitude.  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Fine...  \n&gt;**$Me**: So first click download all. It's going to download the Zip file first, but once we have it we can pull the documents you need out of it. *(Finally relieved I can get the whole sentence out without interruption)*  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Okay okay it's downloaded, now how do I get to it?  \n&gt;**$Me**: Click on it to open it, you'll then have a -  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: It's just a list! Where are my documents!?  \n&gt;**$Me**: Sir those are-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Why can't I just get my documents why does this have to be so hard! This system is so stupid why can't you just send me it?  \n&gt;**$Me**: Look, if you don't want to deal with the zip file fine we can download it in the file format it's in but it will need to be one at a time. We have to send you it using HIPPA compliant methods, this one is through a third party vendor we use. We can't just send it unencrypted it has your personal information in it. If someone got that you can be a victim of fraud, we don't want that.  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: I don't understand why it has to be SO HARD!!!  \n&gt;**$Me**: Well-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: JUST TELL ME HOW TO GET IT SO I CAN READ IT.  \n&gt;**$Me**: Download it one at a time...  \n  \n  \nThe user ends up downloading 2 out of the 5 files one at a time (multiple times for the same file cause you gotta double click everything right?)  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Why is it in my downloads!? I used to have a save as option why don't I anymore!? Did you change it!?  \n&gt;**$Me**: Sir I can tell you're using Google Chrome and it saves to downloads automatically, the browser that you probably were using was Internet Exp-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: How do I get it out of my downloads?! I want it in MY DOCUMENTS!!!  \n&gt;**$Me**: You just drag and drop it onto the shortcut for your documents.  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Okay, but I don't know why these are named this way I want to name these files something else! How do I rename them?  \n&gt;**$Me**: If you right click you can hit \"Rename\" towards the bottom and type the name you want.  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Okay.. How do I save?  \n&gt;**$Me**: You can just click anything else or hit enter on your-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: THE FILE DISAPPEARED! WHERE DID IT GO!?!  \n  \n  \nAt this point I'm trying not to kill myself at my desk.  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$Me**: The window will try to automatically sort-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: I CAN'T FIND IT! IT'S GONE, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS STUPID PROCESS AGAIN THIS IS BULLSHIT! Oh wait here it is...  \n&gt;**$Me**: *Silence*  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: How do I move it to my documents?  \n&gt;**$Me**: You can drag and drop it onto your shortcut.  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Okay I'm going to drag it to my desktop, then drag it to the documents... wait, I can hit send to... MY DOCUMENTS IS RIGHT THERE!  \n&gt;**$Me**: You can do that as well, I figured you might just prefer to drag and drop it but that option is entirely valid. There's a lot of different ways to accomplish the same task.  \n  \n  \nAt this point he had one file in his documents, he then tried the second file. He couldn't figure out how to get back to his downloads folder so I tried the following knowing this dude is not good at all with computers.  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$Me**: Okay so you can get back to that by clicking the arrow next to the file in chrome and hitting \"Show in Folder\"\n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Okay so right click, open with and system viewer.  \n&gt;**$Me**: No that-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: IT LOOKS DIFFERENT  \n&gt;**$Me**: You have to hit Show in Folder not open with.  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Ohh okay.... open with... System viewer... ITS NOT DOING IT!!!!  \n&gt;**$Me**: No you did open with again, you need to hit show in folder!  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Oh okay... Okay I'm there, why do I have to do all this again? This is a waste of my time. I've been dealing with this for FIVE HOURS WITH THESE STUPID FILES AND THE ZIPS. I JUST WANT MY DOCUMENTS.  \n  \n  \nAt this point he just goes into a rant about how this is our fault that he can't listen to me, nor my colleague that was on the phone with him for an hour before, nor the person who originally sent the files to him and the hour THEY spent with him.  \n  \n  \nThen he drops this on me.  \n  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Look you gotta be getting these calls all the time. I'm good with computers, I've been doing this for 40 years.  \n&gt;**$Me**: *(Awkward silence, I don't want to tell the guy that at four years old I could extract a zip file and this format has been around since the 80's, but I also don't want to lie and feed into his ego).  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Do you get calls all the time for this? You must because this is a shit system.  \n&gt;**$Me**: Well... I've been working here a year and a half and this is the first. We might have one or two emails a month, but it's usually due to an expired link.  \n  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: ... I'm just going to keep calling you guys, and wasting ALL YOUR TIME because you wasted MY TIME!  \n&gt;**$Me**: ...  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: I'm just going to have to drive across the country and pick this up myself.  \n&gt;**$Me**: Look, if you'd like we can just ship you a flash drive with the files. I know we've done it before and it's not a big deal to get that done. Would you like that?  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Hmmm... okay, can you get $Coworker on the line so we can arrange that?  \n&gt;**$Me**: *(Internally thanking whatever spirits are out there for the sweet release of this 57 minute phone call)*  \n&gt;**$Me**: Sure I'm going to conference her into this ca-  \n&gt;**$Ziplord**: Forget it, I'm just going to come it's fine. Goodbye.  \n  \n  \nThat ended that, and hopefully forever. The ticket for this is like a book with the details from all 3 people involved with this guy and he is prohibited from ever calling our internal line ever again now due to his transgressions.  \n  \n**tl;dr** Angry man gets angier at himself for his own ineptitude and has somehow slipped through the cracks of time as he's clearly never used a computer before in his life.  \n  \n**EDIT**: Formatting",

For my team it was fairly simple, we were to move file A from VendorA to VendorB once every day. Easily scripted, and finished with prejudice, however VendorA was having problems encrypting their files (a requirement!) so InfoSec handcuffs the project till VendorA can deliver.\n\nOne month later VendorA still doesn't know how to encrypt their files.

Basically a mini-project that would need to have it's own development cycle.\n\n&gt;$Madman: This is a major change to scope, $NMPM. \n\n&gt;$NMPM: Well, I don't really think so.

The poor old machine won't get past \"Grub stage 2\".  \n\nSince he can't get it going, it's now my turn.  This time, I come prepared, I downloaded a copy of the OS I know was loaded, and get that on a USB drive.  Then, relulctantly, make the drive into the city to address this poor server not doing it's thing.  \n\nWhat \"could\" fix the issue, is getting the thing booted and issuing a command to re-do the grub install.  Not a huge deal, but you need to get the machine to boot off of something other than the hard drive.  \n\nLong in the past, compaq, instead of paying for large roms, would use a small boot rom, and a disk of some sort to provide bios functionality.  This bit me with a workstation in freshman year of HS, and.. now it's come to bite me again.  The GL360 g1, requires that boot disk.  \n\nThe decision was made to abandon that server in place, for at least the week, if not forever.  The backup DNS server was configured to answer on both IP's, and I swung the ethernet cable from OLDDNS01 to OLDDNS02, and now nobody is the wiser.  (outside the engineering group.)  \n\nSince I was at the data center, I decided to do a walk though.  I found six servers, with seven dead drives.  Thankfully, when decommissioning boxes last year, I kept all the old drives, so swaps were easy.  It's still a disturbing number of dead drives.  \n\nI thought I had a lot of spare drives, but replacing 7 quickly makes that pile seem small.  So my job this week, became building a coherant backup policy, ordering a server to make that happen, and start the process of converting all the 5+ year old servers to virtual boxes so we can stop worrying about critical hardware randomly quitting on us.

This controller would monitor security and fire monitoring that would essentially be two controllers (smaller controller for security that would essentially piggy back off of the main controller) \nA few days ago the site has been getting calls every 10-15 minutes telling them that there is a network issue and the controller is down, but then suddenly it would come back up.\nAfter some time troubleshooting, we couldn’t detect the cause, pinging the address when they got an outage notification revealed nothing since we still got a response during the outage.\nUpon calling $redacted and speaking to their support, they kept pointing the finger back at us telling us it was our network because the controller kept getting disconnected for a few seconds and then coming back online. \n\nFor the record, we have no way of getting into the controller as it is managed by them and behind a locked panel, so troubleshooting over the phone doesn't really help.\nRewind to last week, we tell them to send a technician from $redacted to assist as we can't do any real troubleshooting without them present.\n\n$BigBoss meets with them and as they are going through everything, he gets them to disconnect the network cable from the controller and gets them to run a ping on it....odd it's still pinging while disconnected....what?\n$redacted tech mentions he wants to check the second controller, opens up the secondary panel and unplugs the network cable, which immediately kills the ping.\nPlug the first controller back in, ping resumes….oh god.\nSo as it turns out when setting up the controllers, $redacted used the same IP address on the different controllers and this was causing a conflict which is why it kept alerting them of a network issue.\n\nTL; DR 3rd party monitoring company used the same IP address on different controllers during setup and were getting notifications from their 3rd party monitoring station.

Sadly there is very little documentation, and no real history beyond word of mouth from the other tech.  He is very helpful though.\n\n\nAnyways, undeterred I pick up a new ticket, where the user is complaining about what users seem to always complain about: email.  It seems he can only have one attached PST at a time since they recently upgraded to Office 2013 (we are so very modern).  It seems they keep all of their PSTs on their network share on a server I had not encountered yet.  I make a note to see if I have access to it when I return to my desk.\n\n\nAnyways, with the user watching like a hawk on cocaine and asking 50 different questions and telling me things the I've already figured out, I start my investigation.  I can only attach one at a time, despite all attempts of repair and trying Outlook in every running more imaginable.  Damn thing does not function right.  I declare there must be a problem with the security on his share so I leave his office and head back to mine to investigate.\n\n\nThe server is unreachable; like, no-DNS-record unreachable.  I go to plan B - I call the other tech only to be informed that this server no longer exists.  It was decommissioned, in 2014.  This user has been using Offline Files for a network share for OVER 3 AND A HALF YEARS!\n\n\nThis disastrous discovery lead to the entire afternoon spent moving files to his C: drive while mentally facepalming.  I had learned that the new 'network share solution' were now Sharepoint, and backups were made through Symantec Backup and Ghost and this user simply did not want to deal with it, so he kept it somehow thinking that it was still working.\n\n\nWhy did the other friendly tech not say anything?  He knew it would be a 6 hour long ordeal.  Why did the old tech not say anything?  That tech was apparently an a-hole.\n\n\ntl;dr - User sits on a beach waiting for his long lost server to return from sea.",

These rooms typically contain a projector, switcher of some kind, wall mounted speakers, A PC, and most importantly, a UPS. This will be important later.\n\nI'm sitting at my desk, browsing Reddit since the number of calls we receive in the middle of the semester is low. The phone rings for the first time in three hours:\n\n&gt;$Me: [Standard Greeting] How can I help you?\n\n&gt;$I: Hi, I'm in [room] and I can't seem to get any sound from the system.\n\n&gt;$Me: Have you tried ensuring the volume on the control panel as well as the PC is up about halfway?\n\n&gt;$I: Yes, this has happened before and the last time someone came down and opened up the back and did something.\n\nHaving exhausted the remote troubleshooting I can do over the phone for this, I decided to dispatch a tech to the room, which ended up being me. Upon walking into the room, I find it dark, with only the emergency lights on, and I hear the distinctive *beep* of the UPS telling me it's running on battery power. The PC and everything else in the podium is on since the UPS is doing its job. At this point, I'm beginning to suspect that someone tripped a breaker since the hallway lights were on. I grab my phone and try to call back to the office to get the number of facilities, and as it is ringing the power comes back on. Not five seconds later sound is magically coming from the speakers, as expected.\n\nIt's worth noting that typically the fix for this (when the power is working properly) is to restart the switcher in the equipment rack which for some reason loves to lock up for no apparent reason other than the requisite sacrifices not being made...\n\nAfter this, the instructor is curious why it started working when I showed up:\n&gt;$I: So what happened exactly?\n\n&gt;$Me: It seems that the power went out, and the equipment over there stayed on because it has a battery backup system. However, the speakers and the projector are not on that battery, so when the power went out both of them went with it.\n\n&gt;$I: Well thank you for coming down, I thought it was something that I did!\n\n&gt;$Me: Not a problem! Usually resetting these things is all it takes, and the power bump did that for me!\n\n&gt;$I: Hey it worked. Have a good rest of your day!\n\nI then walk back to the office to find that six different buildings had been hit by the power bump and that a lot of the systems did not come back up properly on their own...\n\nI thought it'd be nice to post a story with a (mostly) happy ending!\n\nTL;DR A power bump did my job for me, and speakers need power to work properly.\n\nEdit: formatting.",

        "text": "Way back when, I got a contract as part of a team building a new banking software package for an Eastern European state bank (shortly after the fall of communism - yes, that way back).\n\n\nOur development platform was a small mainframe in our building, while the bank's head office was across the city (and hosted the slightly larger mainframe that was to be the production host).  Eventually (rapidly) it became apparent that the small mainframe couldn't hack it as the development host, so the decision was made to switch to the larger mainframe for coding.\n\n\nOur terminals still connected to our small mainframe, that had a moderate sized network box that connected across dedicated phone lines to the head office (and similar set up at the other end).  As we are coding, response times on the terminals get slower and slower, until the link eventually drops, resets, and response times improve.  Rinse and repeat.\n\n\nIt turns out that communist era copper phone lines aren't suitably shielded (or even protected from the elements) and the communications software at each end is behaving like a pair of deaf old ladies shouting \"what\" at each other repeatedly in between bouts of actually transmitting data.\n\n\nThe state bank is less than impressed at the speed we are working, so bosses point out that being able to produce a single page of code an hour isn't exactly helpful.  Bank says \"fine, we will make the telco improve the link\". \n\n\nTwo days later, we are told \"you are now running over fibre optic, should be much better\".  No one has been to the building, the old network box is still there, no one has dug up the road outside to install the \"brand new technology\" fibre.  What?!?!?\n\nThe \"fibre\" was installed in the exchange, between the end of our line and the end of the line to the bank head office (about 15 feet of \"fibre\" in a 10 mile degraded copper line).\n\nOddly enough, it didn't improve matters much.  They ended up actually relocating the mainframe to our building and buying a slightly larger mainframe.  Was easier and faster than trying to get new connectivity in place.\n\nTL;DR - if you put a few feet of fibre in the middle of 10 miles of dodgy copper cable, it doesn't magically fix your communications issues.

I’m sorry to bother you (wow!) but would you be able to do anything to help with this?\n\nMe: I’ll make sure that the onsite Xerox guy knows the machine is acting up and come down to see you soon.\n\n*Xerox is aware, has ordered a part and I go down to see Jill*\n\nMe: Xerox is on it. I know a little about what Dept.1 does, even less about Dept. 3 and have never been involved with your Dept. 2 for anything related to your file processing. Would you tell me / show me what you do?\n\nJill: Sure, I have these instructions that they gave me…\n\n*It boils down to: open an email, save the attachment to a work folder on her laptop, print that attachment, scan that printout to PDF, log data from it into a spreadsheet on the portal and send the email with the PDF attachment to Dept. 3*\n\nMe: (sensing ripples in the force because that process is pretty nuts) Jill, so that I can get a better feel for what’s going on, would you please show me some of those emails that you get from Dept. 1?\n\n*Jill shows me a couple emails and I think, “no, it can’t be.” I randomly look at maybe 15-20 others…*\n\nMe: So, Jill, the attachments in all of these emails that I’ve looked at are PDFs.\n\nJill: Uh, ok??\n\nMe: Well, here’s the thing: they have you going through all those steps to send PDFs to Dept. 3., which you don’t edit or change in any way, when you already had the files as PDFs from Dept 1. You really don’t need to go through all of that. Honestly, I can’t imagine who came up with this.\n\nJill: (thinking about that) OH MY GOD, YOU’RE RIGHT!!\n\nMe: Alright, here’s the plan. Tell them that I came down about the Xerox and that they’ve ordered a part and will have it up and running as soon as possible – it should be this afternoon.\n\nMe: Maybe tomorrow or the next day, go see *manager* and tell her that you’ve evaluated their process, or however you word it, and have found that there are a lot of unnecessary, time-wasting steps. Say that as long as the files come in as PDF, nothing more than logging the information and whatever else you guys do is necessary. The files are ALREADY PDFs.\n\nThis happened a few months ago. Jill started as a temp and was hired full time recently. She has a funny, quirky personality, her team all enjoy working with her and she knows what she’s doing, but  she gives me credit for her getting hired permanently because of that convert-o-rama.\n\n/TheHappyEnd",

(I explain again)\n\nGuy: Types in his username\n\nMe: Ok now click on the password box, type in your password.

(types in new password) It didn't work!\n\nMe: Ok did you use a combination of 8 numbers and letter or more?\n\nGuy: Oh.... I only used 7...\n\nMe: ...... Ok type a new password. Make sure you have a combination of 8 numbers or letters.\n\nI finally managed to get the guy logged in and he hung up and went along his merry way.\n\nAbout an hour later one of my buddies shouts over his cubicle saying that one of my customers just called and forgot his password and didn't know what his username was.......\n",

Cool, just email the phone number from your desk instead of going to the fax machine to send and receive.

Rule 1 right. I ignore this comment also because the email telling $DH we would come desk side meant that if anyone had any questions regarding the instructions, we could go over it one on one, no one emailed though so we didnt go.\n\n$me : Do you need me to come help out with this\n$DH : No, the instructions are pretty straight forward.\n\nAnd im on to the next ticket…\n",

It's been a while but I'm here with another tale from operations.\n\nAs a lot of you probably know, a lot of the standard interventions or issues in IT are quite often written down in SOP's, Standard Operating Procedures. These exists to make sure everyone has access to the correct way to handle a certain situation.\n\nAs it happened, yesterday, I had an issue for one of the order sessions (where all the orders are sent to the depot for resupply of the stores). There had been an issue with the date calculation, and it needed to be fixed.\n\nEnter, \"Mr Frenchie\", he's a gentleman working for one of our external partners, in this case, tasked with the proper resolution of our problem.\nThey have a procedure they follow to solve this exact issue.\n\nOverall, it caused a bit of a delay, but no other serious issues. That is, until the next order session arrived. It didn't take long for me to start receiving calls that there were no orders coming through, and as a result, 80+ people were stuck not being able to work.\n\n\nYou see, one of the first things Mr Frenchie had to do to start the procedure, was put the program that treats all orders on hold. This is generally considered to be a rather smart thing, since you don't want your data being treated while you're adjusting parameters.\n\n\nThe problem was....he'd forgotten to reactivate it.....\n\n\n(I figured out what had happened rather quickly and released the job, so overall impact was still limited, but still...)",

A recent project had been dropped in my lap, and although I had been far too busy at first to properly meet the project manager's schedule (as, to the best of my knowledge, time travel is not yet available in my region), I had not just caught up but completed all but the very last of my assigned appointments.  \nI had touched base with this particular customer as soon as I could to discuss the appointment, and at their request, rescheduled the appointment for a week later than originally scheduled by the project manager. This made it my last appointment of the project by about four working days.\n\nThe project itself was simple enough: apply a software update to two pieces of equipment that were paired in a parent-child relationship. The normal process would be to update the parent equipment, then let it update the child, but as the equipment was vital to the customer's operation, and said operation could not continue until both units were updated, the project manager had decided on a different approach: we would start the update on the parent, then while it was downloading and applying the update, we would disconnect the child and connect it to a parent unit that we had brought with us in order to apply both updates simultaneously.  \nAs long as we reconnected the child before the parent completed the update, there should be no issues. In theory, the parent unit takes five minutes longer to complete the update process, so this should be simple.\n\nTheories are great, aren't they?\n\nOn the appointed day, at the appointed hour, I arrived at the customer's location, about half an hour's drive from my main office. I made my way inside and was soon introduced to Kate, the lady responsible for running the equipment in question.  \nKate was a surprisingly attractive woman, polite and extremely pleasant to talk to, and judging by the lack of rings on her fingers, somehow still available. Unfortunately, the ring on my finger indicates my lack of availability, and even were that not the case, I do not dip my quill in the company ink.  \nSo Kate would have to remain unwooed; or at least, unwooed by yours truly.\n\nI quickly ran over the upgrade procedure, and what would be required of her during the process; nothing major, just monitor the associated equipment and anyone that happened to use it - if those users needed to use the equipment I was upgrading, they would have to wait until I was finished.\n\n&gt; Kate: Okay... Before we start, I heard that the process changes after the upgrade?\n\n&gt; Me: There are some minor changes: some codes are modified during the upgrade, but I've printed a list of the current codes, and I'll show you how to produce a list of the new codes after the upgrade is complete. Apart from that, the changes are mainly to underlying systems that you will most likely never even see.\n\n&gt; Kate: Oh, okay! I feel much better about it, now that you've explained it.\n\n&gt; Me: No problem - it's why I'm here!\n\nWithout further ado, Kate completed the last process in the system, then gave me the okay to take it offline for maintenance. I initiated the upgrade on the parent unit; then quickly moved the child unit over to the upgrader parent I'd set up previously.  \nI watched the downloads proceed nervously. If ever Murphy were to rear his ugly head, it would be today - on the last appointment of the project, on my last day on the project, in front of an attractive woman... The coincidence was too much; something simply *HAD* to go wrong.\n\nI noticed that condensation had formed under the child unit; a quick inspection revealed that the surface I was resting it on was actually a chest freezer! The cold exterior had caused condensation to pool, right under the unit being upgraded.  \nHere it was. The thing that was going wrong. I lifted the child unit on to a dry surface - it seemed to still be progressing, so I thought it best to wait and see what damage had been done.\n\nThe download completed successfully on the child unit, and was applied without error.  \nI disconnected it from the upgrade parent unit and reconnected it to the original parent unit.\n\nThe parent unit finished applying the update, and restarted. Both parent and child started correctly.  \nSystems testing revealed no issues.\n\nI generated the new list of codes, and compared it to the old list, making adjustments as required. In a matter of moments, the system was configured correctly and ready for use - conveniently timed, as a wave of users chose that time to arrive. I let Kate know that she was able to process the user's requests as normal, showing her the new codes to use.  \nShe picked it up perfectly without requiring a second explanation.\n\nAfter ~~wasting ten minutes~~ observing the upgraded equipment perform correctly in production with live users, I finished packing up the last of my equipment.\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, we're done here Kate - everything is working the way it should be, and you seem to have the hang of the few changes that you need to know about. If you have any issues, just call the number that's printed on the unit - that will get you through to the help desk, and they'll call me.\n\n&gt; Kate: Oh wow - that's it? Thank you so much! You made this whole upgrade process so easy - and way less scary than I thought it would be!\n\nWell, that's quite possibly the nicest thing a customer has said to me in quite some time.\n\n&gt; Me: Jus' happy to help, ma'am.\n\n---\n\nIn short, she:\n\n* was prepared for the appointment she booked\n\n* had actually read the accompanying documentation\n\n* listened to the new information I provided\n\n* was actually grateful to the attending technician\n\nand was easy on the eyes to boot.  \nIn a word: a unicorn.\n\n**TL/DR:** I found a unicorn!",

I'm not supposed to start for another 20 mins, but I'm nice, so I answer it.\n\n\"This new laptop doesn't have Microsoft on it. Do I need to bring it back in? Just I'm in Scotland, so I'll have to fly down again.\"\n\nEr, yes it does. We went through it when I handed it over, I showed you Outlook, and how Outlook 2016 looks ever so slightly different to Outlook 2010 on your old laptop.\n\n\"Look, it's not there. Every time I click on the button, it just opens the internet. I've emailed my boss from my phone to let him know I'm cancelling all my appointments today, so can you fix it over the VPN or do I need to fly down?\"\n\nSo, I ask him what he's clicking on. \"The blue E. You said the icon was blue now instead of orange. But that just opens the internet, I've already TOLD YOU.\"\n\nI ask him to look along the taskbar for any other blue icons. \"There's a blue and white O. Are you telling me that's it?\" I ask him to confirm that Outlook begins with the letter O, and advise him to try clicking on that icon instead.\n\nSo he clicks on it, and ta-da! Outlook opens. \"Oh for God's sake. This is too confusing. Why did you change the colour anyway? Now I have to re-arrange all my appointments, this is really inconvenient.\"\n\nSorry, I did ring up my mate Bill and ask him to change the colour of Outlook from orange to blue just to confuse you. Luckily I have great power and influence over at Microsoft, so they did me a favour, and I'm now reaping the untold rewards.\n\nGTG, writing an email to his boss to cover my arse...\n",

These are devices they specced, ordered, and had installed with zero input from anyone in IT so $FT lets her know we'd be happy to move them but we're unable to instruct anyone in their configuration or use. $Derp seems happy with this and says no problem so they head to $Derp's area.\n\n$FT moves the devices and hooks them up as they were on the other PCs and reiterates that he's done all he can and that $Derp will have to ask one of her coworkers that's familiar with the device for instructions on how to use it. As you might expect, this led to an infinite loop of \"How do I use this\", \"I don't know, you'll have to ask a coworker that uses it\", \"but how do I use this\", \"I don't know, you'll have to ask a coworker that uses it\", etc, etc. $FT finally decides to walk her through as much as he can figure out, and finally gets to the part where she enters her username and password which are the same ones she uses for the PC version of the application on a daily basis.\n\n$FT - What's your password?\n\n$Derp - I don't know.\n\n$FT - It's the same one you use to login to *application* on your PC.\n\n$Derp - I don't know that one.\n\n$FT - Didn't you just log in with it though?\n\n$Derp - Yes.\n\n$FT - Then what did you use for the password?\n\n$Derp (getting irate) - I don't know, all I see for my password is asterisks!\n\n$FT (growing more confused) - But you have to enter a password for anything to show up there...\n\n$Derp - BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECAUSE ALL IT SHOWS ME IS THE ASTERISKS!\n\n$FT - You don't know what you type?\n\n$Derp - NO, THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU!\n\n$FT (finally has her enter her password on the PC very slowly so he can copy down which keys she hits.) Okay, your password is *word123*.\n\n$Derp - Yes, I know.\n\n$FT - Why didn't you just tell me that?\n\n$Derp - BECAUSE IT JUST COMES UP AS ASTERISKS!!!\n\n$FT - Okay, well, you're logged in and ready to go.
