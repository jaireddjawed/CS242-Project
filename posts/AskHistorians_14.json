        "text": "The title of my post pretty much sums it up. I was just wondering of examples of when rulers or leadership of empires or countries or any kind of administrative unit just kind of blindly threw money at a problem hoping it would go away.\n\nLooking for examples where it was just wealth rather than things like throwing hordes of bodies into a battle to win it and times where it was done without much strategy. Obviously wealthy rulers/administrations have used their wealth strategically to solve issues, but I'm kind of wondering about problems leaders just tried to make go away by throwing ungodly amount of riches at them without good planning/strategy/grace. And times that this strategy has worked/failed. \n\nThis seems like something that has happened many times throughout history. Are there any examples when this has worked swimmingly? Times it has failed miserably?\n\nI promise I'm not trying to usurp your knowledge for some kind of school project, this was kind of just a shower thought, well... more of a shower question I had and started wondering about. This seemed like a good place to ask without it turning into a political slugfest.",

Such example of Stalin, Stalin himself killed more than 20 million of his own country men, especially during Ukrainian famine, and after ww2 where he ordered the execution of every captured russian soldiers, or about Mao? Mao himself have the highest kill coun there is over 50 million+ chinese died in his regime and yet he was looked favorably than Mussolini or Francisco Franco?\n\nWhy don't we hold communism and marxism to high scrutiny like the Fascist and  the Nazis? Like in media they are portrayed as hero of equality when they are not?\n\nWhy is that? I am genuinely confused to why is that?",

In a previous podcast, he repeated this claim, but added more detail, specifically claiming that a) The U.S. military was planning for a massive  land war with the USSR and b) the presence of nuclear weapons prevented such a conflict from happening.\n\nIs this the academic consensus on the role that expanding nuclear arsenals played in a U.S. - Soviet conflict?\n\nNote: I normally would not believe the opinion of a VC and software engineer related to nuclear history, but Andresseen is known to be an avid reader, curious and willing to learn, even with topics not related to his domain.",

I look forward to any examples you can share that I might study up more on!\n\nThank you very much.",

I was under the impression that Justice Myron Cady Cramer and Justice John Patrick Higgins were the only 2 justices representing the US at the tribunal (with Cramer replacing Judge Higgins in July 1946). Wouldn't it be unequal to have 2 justices representing the US at the tribunals while the other countries represented only had one justice each?\n\nIs the National World War 2 Museum article blatantly wrong?

The wiki page listed US states &amp; the number of cities whose names have changed. For example, Florida changed 5 or 6 city names, New Mexico changed maybe 10 city names, whereas Illinois changed several dozen names of cities. Sometimes more than once! Sometimes the changes were total, sometimes as small as Athens to New Athens or Baden to New Baden. \n\nI suspect this question might not receive a satisfactory answer, simply because I suspect the claim made by that tiktok is outright false &amp; merely a production of faulty, incomplete information \n\nBut if Illinois were somehow unique &amp; changed the names of cities 10x more often than other states, well I'd certainly be interested in knowing why!",

        "text": "So I know a lot places have competing claims for why THEIR colonial historical document or favored writer influenced the First Amendment's religious protections the most, so I am trying not to ask who was FIRST.\n\nI want to ask what document or line of legal thinking influenced the decision to make the first amendment protect religion's \"free exercise\" from Congress. Was it especially inspired by any source documents? Any legal tradition? Or was it just the confluence of a whole lot of conflicting motivations and ideologies and religions and the framers decided \"let's just try to head this off at the pass before it wrecks our new government?\"\n\nFor reference, I have had a beast of a time asking this question, which may mean it is a bad question poorly phrased.\n\nInitially sparked by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/112zk59/was_new_york_city_uniquely_more_tolerant_of/j8q1xfj/), particularly this quote:\n\n&gt;Then, as of the later 20th century, the answer became yes: the Dutch put New York on a different path from the outset and echos of that history can be felt today. This is the story basically laid out in the document OP quoted above. It can also be found in books like Russel Shorto's Island at the Center of the World (2004) which follows New Amsterdam lawyer Andrian van der Donck and his fight for greater democratic rights from Dutch authorities. The book also talks about the Dutch origins of the Flushing Remonstrance, a document demanding religious tolerance from the New Netherland government that is often seen as a precursor to the First Amendment. Although written by English settlers, it's directed at Dutch authorities and it appeals to rights that the Dutch afforded their citizens in Europe.\n\nIn response I asked how the Flushing Remonstrance compared to other documents, like Maryland's Act Concerning Religion in 1649, but it was too broad (Across too many colonies) for u/fearofair give a decent answer.\n\nTried to ask it as \"Who was FIRST in US Religious Freedom and What Had The Most Influence on the 1st Amendment?\" and got told it was better for the short answers thread, but that's not really what I am getting at. \"First\" is gonna depend on the framing of the question more than anything. It's boring.\n\nAnd then I tried to ask again as \"What Document or Body of Law Most Influenced the Religious Freedom Aspect of the 1st Amendment\" and it got caught cause I didn't have a question mark.\n\nThen I added the question mark and got \"we don't do people's homework.\" So at this point I should probably have just started researching, but I am stupid! So I'm trying one more time. For reference I am 31 years old, and although I am taking a community college class right now it is a Cell and Molecular Biology course and the First Amendment's origin story is not pertinent to it. This isn't homework!",

I started playing the new Like A Dragon game, set during that time period, and the intellectual history of Japanese Isolationism / Nativism is something I'm having trouble wrapping my head around. I understand (on a pretty basic \"read some Wikipedia articles\" level) the origin of the Sakoku Isolationist system, the growth of the Kokugaku school that championed native Japanese ideas, and the idea that most of the loyalists \"ishin shishi\" wanted to restore the emperor because the believed that the Shogun couldn't protect them from foreigners. At it's core, I'm still confused how a movement that won a civil war organizing under the slogan of \"Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\" could then, when in power, create a government modeled so strongly on foreign ideas-- and one that had far more contact with foreigners than the Shogunate had, either through trade or colonization. Wikipedia tells me that once in power the Meiji government used the slogan \"Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Armed Forces,\" but that seems a pretty far cry from the violently isolationist rallying cry it's supporters fought under. \n\nI know that a revolutionary ideology and the ruling ideology of a successful revolutionary government are rarely the same but I have some idea how the thinking evolved in say, the French or Russian Revolutions. Can someone explain to me how the ideology behind a violently isolationist revolutionary force became the ideology behind a modernizing, westernizing, and internationally engaged empire?",
