I've long forgotten the second half. \n\nWithout the second half of the riddle, the answer becomes &gt;!\"The Pen is Mightier Than The Sword\"!&lt;. \n\nExplanation: &gt;!Speak and peak are the exact same word, with one small *difference*. The S. The next line states, \"you want this when you word\", so add the S to WORD and you get SWORD. Which isn't as strong as that, or so I've heard. But what could that be referring to? A pen.!&lt;\n\nI've though of similar ways to use this specific trick, and I've thought of similar tricks that aren't 100% the same but use similar principles. \n\nAnybody else have any similar ideas to craft a riddle using wordplay?",

I make celebrities look stupid and normal people look like celebrities. I turn your pancakes brown, and I make your champagne bubble. If you squeeze me, I’ll pop. If you’ll look at me, you’ll pop. Can you guess the riddle?” Could be answered with pressure in different forms. The clues in the riddle refer to the various ways in which pressure can affect things:\n\n\"I turn polar bears white\" refers to the fact that pressure can turn ice into snow, which made polar bears appear white\n\"I will make you cry\" refers to emotional pressure or stress, which can make people feel overwhelmed or upset.\n\"I make guys have to pee and girls comb their hair\" refers to the physical pressure on the bladder and the social pressure on women to maintain their appearance.\n\"I make celebrities look stupid and normal people look like celebrities\" refers to the pressure of fame and how it can affect both celebrities and non-celebrities in different ways.\n\"I turn your pancakes brown, and I make your champagne bubble\" refers to the fact that pressure can cause heat to build up, which can cook food and create carbonation.\n\"If you squeeze me, I’ll pop. If you’ll look at me, you’ll pop\" refers to the fact that pressure can build up until it causes something to burst or explode, which can happen if you squeeze a container or if you stare at a pressure gauge for too long.",

Hopefully, I’m not immediately demonstrating my naivety by breaking Rule 8:‘No AIs’ by initiating a discussion…about riddles and AIs :')\n\nI’m developing an online riddle-like game and if all of the linguistic content could simply be blasted away in 5 minutes with the use of a LLM, I would have to have a bit of a re-think as to how I approach it.\n\nSo far, I’ve only managed to test ChatGPT, and whilst I thought it would serve as a useful hints system I wasn’t too concerned as it needed a substantial amount of prompting to get it on track. And with more complex challenges it would often go off on wild tangents that would be more distraction than assistance.\n\nYou would think these things are just going to keep getting better, but given Microsoft’s apparently severe nerfing of Bing Chat (Sydney) in recent days, I wonder whether things might get too scary too quickly and developers rein the publicly available version of their products in which could slow relative progress?\n\nWhat do you think?",
