        "text": "Apologies for this *very* long post:\n\nOver a decade ago, my journey into exploring ways to approach life and thinking and value started when I read an autobiography by a ex-juvenile delinquent/criminal turned Buddhist. It got me thinking more about how to experience the world in a positive light despite everything feeling like shit all the time.\n\nThen I started listening to Philosophize This on my long commutes to work. I know this sub and the more serious-minded philosophy enthusiasts/graduates/etc don‚Äôt take that podcast seriously. Maybe it was a mistake. I don‚Äôt know.\n\nThen I would watch things like Crash Course Philosophy. Then School of Life videos about various Philosophers. A few Philosophy Tube videos, a few Then &amp; Now videos. Then I watched Shelly Kagan‚Äôs Yale course on death. I watched Michael Sugrue lectures. I read Ryan Holiday pitch Stoicism like it was a get rich quick scheme.\n\nI read Siddhartha. It was nice, but I already knew the main bullet points.\nI read a tiny bit of Thus Spake Zarathustra. It was hard to understand.\nI read a tinier bit of The Myth of Sisyphus. It was even harder to understand.\nI read a tiny bit of Meditations. It didn‚Äôt really grab me.\n\nI read some of The Philosophy Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained and some of another pint-sized ‚Äúcrash course‚Äù of Philosophy book that I keep next to the toilet.\n\nAll of the above over the past 10ish years and all I think I really know is the following:\n\n* Plato thought all trees and the way each of us see a tree relates to some form of a ‚Äútree.‚Äù And the thing about the cave, which anyone who spends 5 minutes hearing a synopsis can understand and carry with them forever.\n\n* Socrates might have been real or made up by Plato, but he died proud of questioning authority and the status quo. Basically Jesus of Philosophy.\n\n* Descarte was skeptical about everything and came up with the ‚ÄúI think therefore I am‚Äù thing.\n\n* Hobbes believed a monarch was the best way to run a government. Maybe for the time he was alive that was true, but I imagine most people disagree with it today and it might not be useful anymore?\n\n* Kant married two ideas that you couldn‚Äôt know anything unless you observed it and that you could only know things by deducing them logically in your mind. He, or the people who talk about him, are obsessed with unmarried bachelors, the four sides of a house, and the position of a boat out at sea. Apparently we all wear spectacles we can‚Äôt take off and only perceive existence through them and can‚Äôt actually know real reality because of them.\n\n* Camus doesn‚Äôt think you should kill yourself even though it‚Äôs an enticing idea since the world has no meaning.\n\n* Baudrillard thinks we don‚Äôt value things because of their usefulness or even perceived value anymore and only worship signs (which are a form of made up value? Idk.)\n\nAnd that‚Äôs about it. On one hand I feel like I need to take notes and learn all the little details about various Philosophers throughout history and how they compare to each other, but then I wonder what usefulness that has in terms of taking the ideas away and applying value to my own life. I‚Äôm not about to read The Critique of Pure Reason when I can barely grasp what Kant is talking about from the various filters through which I‚Äôve experienced the main ideas.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure where to go from here. Just buckle down and actually read The Republic? Something else? Give it all up entirely? I can‚Äôt help but feel drawn and fascinated by the practice of Philosophy, but after all this time and my half-hearted effort, I‚Äôm wondering what I should even expect to take away from it all.\n\nSorry for the long post. Thank you to anyone who reads it.",

One thing I'd like to have at my disposal is a general or encyclopedia-/dictionary-adjacent reference to all the important jargon and people (for whatever that may be worth).\n\nI am and have been aware of the Stanford Encyclopedia for at least half this time, but I recently became aware of the Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Thumbed through it recently and I was impressed especially by its inclusion of non-Western figures and terminology. Thing is, it's coming up on 2 decades old, and I worry that things may be outdated.\n\nMy question is what would be the best source or sources to go with as far as a general reference for philosophy that would give me a good amount of detail and accuracy? Is Stanford the end-all? Oxford Companion? Some mix of the two and/or some other resource I've overlooked?\n\nI would really appreciate it to hear what others here with more knowledge and experience think of these and other reference sources, both strengths and shortcomings.",

        "text": "David Lewis in the late twentieth century defended a position he called Human Supervenience. It is part of the neo-Humean metaphysics which is a popular paradigm today in contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of science. It is a form of atomism and ontological reductionism. Atomism is the metaphysical framework which holds that the world is not an indivisible whole, but rather, is made up of and reducible to its parts ‚Äî that the world is an aggregate of parts. This is contrasted with metaphysical holism which is a metaphysical framework which holds that the world is a single, indivisible whole, not reducible to the sum of its parts.\nLewis described his metaphysical vision of reality by saying ‚ÄúIt is the doctrine that all there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact, just one little thing and then another.‚Äù It is the theory that theory that said that there was nothing to reality except the spatio-temporal distribution of local natural properties. According to him, there are identifiable fundamental physical objects at points in spacetime. He did this by showing in detail how laws, chances, counterfactual dependence, causation, dispositions and colours could be located within this Humean mosaic. \n\nHumean Supervenience can thus be seen as the conjunction of three theses.\n1. Truth supervenes on being (Bigelow, 1988). That is, all the facts about a world supervene on facts about which individuals instantiate which fundamen- tal properties and relations.\n2. Anti-haeccaetism. All the facts about a world supervene on the distribution of qualitative properties and relations; rearranging which properties hang on which ‚Äòhooks‚Äô doesn‚Äôt change any facts.\n3. Spatio-temporalism. The only fundamental relations that are actually instantiated are spatio-temporal, and all fundamental properties are properties of points or point-sized occupants of points.\n\nWith Humean Supervenience explained, I was therefore wondering what are some of the best arguments that can be utilised against it? These can be arguments which are more philosophically motivated (a priori) or even scientifically motivated (a posteriori). Further links or readings for me to do further research into is fine too. I really appreciate any help on this. Thanks everyone üëçüèª.",

Verify that your weapons are harmless, and take the most trustworthy hostage, so that no human life will be in danger (or one lapses into the criminal). Demand a ransom, and make it so that the operation creates as much commotion as possible - in short, remain close to the \"truth,\" in order to test the reaction of the apparatus to a perfect simulacrum. You won't be able to do it: the network of artificial signs will become inextricably mixed up with real elements (a policeman will really fire on sight; a client of the bank will faint and die of a heart attack; one will actually pay you the phony ransom), in short, you will immediately find yourself once again, without wishing it, in the real, one of whose functions is precisely to devour any attempt at simulation, to reduce everything to the real - that is, to the established order itself, well before institutions and justice come into play.\"\n\nMy question is then; how is this any different than a simple misunderstanding? is that what simulation is then?

        "text": "I was thinking about ethics, but they don't always work in practice.\n\nFor example, a nurse that has an aggressive patient in a nursing home. The nurse has the responsibility to take care of the patient. The patient is ethically wrong, if he's aggressive because he's frustrated with the situation and taking it out on the nurse.\n\nHowever, there is nothing that protects the nurse. The patient is always in the right and cannot be cut loose because his right to healthcare weighs heavier than a safe environment for the nurse. \n\nI find this a huge problem, and it makes me wonder if ethics even work. Healthcare workers keep facing more and more aggression, and it's not like anyone is doing anything about it.\n\nOf course, you could just sedate aggressive patients, but that goes against the autonomy of said patients and while I do agree that it's wrong to just sedate people left and right. I also feel it's wrong to let health care workers face aggressive or violent patients. \n\nSo I feel like ethics fail because you can in this situation make up no ethical or good solution. Other than that the healthcare workers just have to 'deal' with it. All types of deescalation are always the responsibility of the patient. The patient has 0 responsibilities til they become so aggressive they are send to a special ward where they can be sedated against their will...\n\nIt might be I don't have a good understanding of ethics, forgive me if this is the case. I have tried to read some philosophies though and I cannot really find an answer. I don't see the point of ethics, when it cannot solve issues like this. But maybe it can and I'm just inept.",

I understand he wants to undermine the whole traditional approach and way of doing metaphysics, but it does not seem that he actually transcends or abandon metaphysics as such (he even had the famous beef with Carnap). Correct me if I am wrong, but what he does is clearly metaphysics. I would say that he just does metaphysics differently, in a new way, that he just shifts the paradigm of metaphysics or something like that. \n\nAm I misunderstanding something?

She states men sexualize women more than women sexualize men. I would agree with this statement. She also states that men should not sexualize women. I can see her sentiment behind this statement and want to agree, but it seems to me that sexualizing is something biological. Something we as people can't control initially but can stop once it has started. As in, you can find someone attractive but not think about having sex with them. Or something happening that ruins the initial attraction to them for you. To act on one's attraction and continue to entertain that idea is where I can see someone coming up with an argument against sexualization.\n\nShe states one should not be sexualized unless you give other's consent to do so. I'm stumped on this statement. On one hand I don't see how you can justify trying to control someone's thoughts as moral, even if you have the best intentions in mind. On the other hand, I understand people's discomfort with having relatively unwanted unsolicited thoughts about them. What are your thoughts on this?",

If not only for the fact of using religion as an excuse for evil.   \nExamples being The Crusades (war stemmed from religion), or the KKK's \"religious calling\"  \n\n\nI came to here because I was wanting to get feedback on my prompt  \n\n\nand especially could really use some ideas for sources and material I could use to research it.

Particularly measurements? \n\nAfter reading ¬ß88 in PI by Wittgenstein and thinking hard about Plank Units (the supposed smallest units in the universe) I feel I must conclude with him, at this stage (¬ß88), that there is no absolute ‚ÄòExactness‚Äô. \nOnly an infinite scale of anything and you can point as far along it as you want but never be totally exact or reach an end. \n\nI can‚Äôt seem to crosspost to this sub so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/11dkola/plank_units_absolute_exactness/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is a link to the main body of the question I have in mind (I apologise if this contravenes some rule that gives rise to the lack of crossposting too, let me know and I‚Äôll take it down) \n\nThe meta question which Wittgenstein follows up with is how then can we call logic ‚Äòsublime‚Äô if it seemingly is meant to be exact when talking of things but no such exactness is possible. What do you think? \n\nMy answer is that perhaps because we created logic within limits of the concepts of understanding and cognition (our own thinking limits), it only operates at these limits. \nSo it is sublime only to the perception of man - he is limited. Sublime to him in that it works with some degree of exactness regarding all the notions man has produced (not discovered). This assumes the Transcendental Ideal position I think; that all that man can deal with is of his own comprehension or ‚Äòrepresentations‚Äô. \nErgo, logic is not sublime or perfect when considered mind-independently in the real of things as they are in themselves, which is infinitely unlimited perhaps? Just as infinite as the measure of units in the universe? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and the original post which is more in-depth regarding physics (but still philosophical) and providing your answers.",

Since mental states are inherently private, they cannot be the study of empirical science. Psychology should instead focus on the observable actions, not the unknowable beliefs or desires of the subjects. \n\nWhy not both the mind and the behaviors? There is neuroscience which studies the mind as a whole, including the behaviors in connection with the neural network. Psychology can study both, why commit to one? Is the assumption that study of the mind is not possible reversed nowadays among behaviorists?\n\n~**Psychological behaviorism**: everything that someone does can be explained without reference to some internal mental state, but only through the use of external or environmental evidence.\n\nAn individual could be angry with a poker face in any environmental setting: how can you tell he is angry by looking at the environment.? \n\n~**Philosophical behaviorism**: any psychological theory which references mental terms or concepts can and should translate those terms and concepts into behavioral terms and concepts.\n\nWhy 'should' ?

What I gathered from the Experience Machine is that it concludes that people value authenticity and that pleasure is not the only important thing for a human being, and that it was meant to be a counterargument to hedonism. But I don‚Äôt see how this is is linked to or relevant for his politics? I‚Äôve mailed my professor but his reply was very vague and I‚Äôm a bit doubtful since he‚Äôs made other statements that were questionable (like Marx favouring equality of outcome).\n\nFor context we had to read chapter 7 of Anarchy, State and Utopia.",

I am not a student any longer, and don‚Äôt have access to my old textbooks to find some translated works by him. \nSo I am looking for the following resources: \n1. Complete translated (trusted) works by Heraclitus available through a local library or for purchase\n2. Companions to Heraclitus‚Äô works to help understand them. \n3. Writings that oppose or contradict him. \n4. Voices from outside Greek (and Western) thought that either affirm or refute Heraclitus. \n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations and help!",

        "text": "It seems like many philosophy podcasts are very educational and geared towards an audience that doesn't know much philosophy.  So they might be introductions to some famous historical philosopher, or some major subfield of philosophy, etc.  If it is an interview with a contemporary philosopher, they usually take many pains to gently introduce topics and not get too into the weeds.  They almost feel too NPRish, if that makes any sense.  Suspiciously high production quality, etc.  \n\nAre there any philosophy podcasts that just dive into it?  The closest I can think of is Mindscapes by Sean Carroll, but those aren't usually philosophical. Conversations with Tyler is another great one but very rarely Philosophy related.  Very little mind numbing introductions, the host just has the conversation they want to have rather than assuming the audience is ignorant of philosophy and/or dumb and needs to be hand held through everything.\n\n Philosophy Bites and Philosophy Talk are precisely the sort of style I want to avoid.\n\nWhen I say philosophy I mean in the mainstream anglophone tradition.. what gets called \"analytic philosophy\"",
