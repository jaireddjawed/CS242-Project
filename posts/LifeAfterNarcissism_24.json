        "text": "I'm currently not in a relationship with any co-dependents, but I'm processing abuse I experienced at the hands of a co-dependent partner. I feel at this point that I don't want to date co-depedents because, even though not all of them are abusive, I think they may be more likely to be abusers due to their controlling tendencies. As I am more vulnerable to abuse, I need to be extra careful. There are a lot of guides to avoiding narcissists, but not a lot of stuff on avoiding co-dependents.\n\nI think I'm disproportionately attracted to them because I was physically neglected and emotionally abused as a child by my nfather. I survived a lot of my adolescence by being attractive to older co-dependents and narcissists. I have this intense hunger for being being loved and adored and I will basically fall in love with anyone who is nice to me. My mental health issues mean I require a lot of care-taking. I'm really bad at having boundaries or standing up for myself.",

My goal is to get enough money to move out and then in that case get an apartment. \n\nmy dad and my stepmom are both very very two faced and may be narcissistic, they share several traits of the parents that i see on raisedby sub. \n\nMy dad has been increasingly stressing me out to the point where i can't eat cannot sleep and want to die constantly. I asked my grandparents to let me stay with them and they said ok. \n\nI began to move my things today but my father locked the house with deadbolt and all, so I climbed in through my room window. I just turned 18 so as far as I know, him locking me out is illegal until i get an eviction notice. He locked me out to try and prevent me from getting in until I \"talk\" to him. His talks are always a facade. He pretends to be calm about certain issues and pretends to agree with me, but then later will stand in my doorway for half hour or more ripping into me verbally over things like leaving a cup of water on the floor, etc.  \n\nAnyway. I \"broke into\" my own room, since he locked me out. I moved all of my stuff out, at least what I cared about and could fit in my car. I left some things behind. Oh well. I'm out. \n\nThen immediately after he gets home from work he sends my grandparents a 3 page long letter about how they need to know \"what they are getting into\" by taking me in. He accused me of driving high (which I do not. I do smoke, but I would never fucking drive high, i am too paranoid for that) and said i need therapy and  blah blah. (Jokes on him i am already in therapy for a slurry of issues that a life of living with him has caused)  \n\nHe also left a box of my property on their driveway. He texted them to \"get to it before me\". Fortunately Ifound it before they did. It had some stuff like empty MMJ containers. (legal since i got my mmj card when I turned 18.) I threw it away. he was trying to sabotage my safe haven by showing them I smoke. I actually stopped smoking, because life at home got so stressful that not even smoking could alleiviate it. I'm part of group therapy now, and hopefully on my way to see a psych eventually. \n\nI feel so stale. I'm so damaged right now, so stressed, fragile. i cant work until i finish therapy (i can only handle one thing at a time rn. my therapist gave me a work off note for 2 weeks then i am getting another.) \n\nI feel relief from escaping but i also feel him looming over me. i moved ALL my important belongings in less than an hour. i am sore all over.\nmy head hurts. i have cried so much today. i feel like he is watching me, waiting for any opportunity to guilt trip me back into that dreadful house where i get called names (my dad &amp; stepmom have conversations in their room where they think i cannot hear them but i can) and get plotted against. i get accused of things i don't do, on the regular. i was beyond stressed, i was ready to put a shell through my brain. i wasnt eating. i wasnt sleeping. that is no life to me. no life at all.\n\nMaybe now I can recover. But it will take time.\n\nNow what?",

I was starting to like him due to the cuddling and great sex and i find him really attractive. \nMy young friend sees us together we all hang out and the next day at work she informs me that she too has slept with him recently. she says shell let me know if she does it again she might just make out with him, she doesnt wanna date him but i can tell on her face and the way they interact she is definetely at least crushing on him. she made me promise to not tell him. i broke that promise a few hours later (i promised before i knew what she was gunna say) and told him i wasnt interested in sleeping with him if he was gunna be sleeping with my girl as well. he was like im not sure if were gunna do it again it was just a random thing, and anyways i thought we were having fun. i was just like im too old for this shit and i guarentee in a few weeks its gunna get messy. so i benched myself. I keep thinking about him though and my friend is worried that im hurt and says she doesnt wanna ruin stuff for me but i feel like the only move is to let things play out between the two of them. i just asked her how things went today with him. not sure what my intentions where curious i guess and she hasnt responded. god bless u if ur still reading this. any insight? the dude is really nice and the sex was really good. \n",

She told me she was proud of me, helped me clean a mess, and we even took a walk on campus together.

Primarily Edad and GCBro, but he puts up with nmoms bs because it means he can see Edad and GCBro.  \n\nAnyway, short backstory. Went NC after Nmom accused me of being the reason GCBro's child was born with a genetic heart defect and if she died in theatre it was my fault (if I'm that godly why am I so broke?! Lol). I realised at this point just how very demented she is and I couldn't cope with her toxicity.\nBaby was fine. Not spoken to them since. This was 2 years ago. M maintains contact under a strict set of rules. We do  *not* sugar coat her bullshit, if it's emotional abuse- we call it that. We **never** say \"it's just her way, it's ok\", and if he ever needs to leave then he messages me a seemingly stupid message and I send him one back saying I need him home now because of (insert ridiculous reason here).\n\nNow that's out the way... here's where I need advice\n\nGCBro has 2 bio kids who neither him nor his evil wife (deffo N) care for. Their care is down to my parents. That's a whole other argument. So. M goes to visit Edad and GCBro 2 kids are there (2 &amp; 6). Edad keeps telling Nmom he's had enough of how she treats certain people differently and up until  the granddaughter came along (2 y.o.) the grandson (6) had been \"their world\". Because of this he's a spoiled brat and cries if you even look at him wonky. So now Edad is seemingly seeing how she's gone from one grandchild to another and always treats the latest one as her bestest best ever..  urgh. Edad goes for a walk to clear his head. According to M he's been doing this for a while and going on  walks for hours just to get away from her. He left her with the 2 kids and M. As soon as he walked out, Nmom starts screaming at the 6.y.o. and saying \"you're the reason your grandad and I are splitting up! You're evil! Why won't you just stop!?\" Ofc, 6y.o. is fucking sobbing at this point which infuriates her. M, being older and somewhat wiser, understands he can't do anything because it will make her a thousand times worse. But also that her behaviour is totally unacceptable. He came home early to tell me. \n\nNow. I haven't spoken to GCBro since the incident and I know he's full of hate for me for things that I genuinely didn't do but his fucked up missus has drip fed him her bollocks. So I can't message him and tell him what happened. He wouldn't believe me anyway. If I phone social services then I become the bad guy and they'll hide her behaviour because she's perfect. But I can't just leave it can I??she is emotionally abusing a child! What would you guys Do?",

Then an SMS for my birthday, but now he resorted to sending this harmless seeming bullshit, like he can't miss my birthday, so Happy Birthday! (how pretentious, right? As if I ever wanted his attention ever again or it would upgrade the event somehow if he acknowledged it, as if is message did anything else but shit on it and on me) and where he lives now and bla, he even tricked me into writing to him (was asking who it is since he wrote with a new number and added a few untypical things like not using capitals, which he usually does not do, so I might not assume it's him) on whatsapp.\n\nSo I blocked him there, and did not react further. Now, over a year later, I got an e-mail. Again just one line, that he could not help his curiosity and is happy I \"made it\" (got certain job, which he surely knows from LinkedIn, where he searched for me, or by googling me or whatever)\n\nBut why? What is the purpose of this bs? It's not like now I will suddenly answer after ignoring him for 2 years. They say hoovering is for energy supply and all. What exactly provides this? Is he like, magically sucking energy from me because I am now annoyed by his mail? Or does it give him energy to write such a mail and call himself to mind again? Or would it only give him energy if I reacted?\n\nI considered sending him a mailer daemon fake message from a disposable mail address, it's not like he could see the difference to a real one. But do I really want him to think his mail did not reach me? Maybe then he writes SMS again. \n\nWhat's the purpose? Will it ever stop?\n\nWhat also surprises me is that he always looked down so much on desperate seeming people, there were two guys who had fallen in love with me, didn't want both, and he said so often how ridiculous they were by keeping trying after I turned them down, and that they had no pride. But today I gotta say, none of them was as persistent as he is. \n\nI don't get that he does not realize what a lame fool he makes out of himself by keeping running after me. \n\nI guess the only threat that comes from this messages is that I am tempted to answer something, like: Aren't you getting embarrassed by yourself? \nBut that would only fuel debate and make him happy, so I for sure won't ever answer.

        "text": "Not sure if this belongs here, but figured I'd get it off my chest at least and try to get some advice. \n\nI had an abusive childhood. My mother was single. I was the unplanned child (my mother's other son as well who is my twin but I don't like to call him that) of my mother screwing around with a married guy. He didn't come see me when I was born; I only met him when I was thirteen and he only stayed three days and communicated in very widely spaced apart facebook messages after that. \n\nI could never fully relax around my mother because the moment I put my guard down, shit hit the fan, excuse my language. I never knew which mother I would wake up to or come home from school to, the good mom or the bad mom. I have no positive memories of my mom and frankly I don't like to call her that. \n\nShe was cold and aloof when it was just me and her other child, but when friends were over, she had me sit on her lap, told me she loved me. We could joke and have fun. But as soon as they left, I could feel the dread set over me. \n\nKnow this is kinda long, so I'll try to be concise as I can. Trigger warning: there is mention of nonconsensual sexual encounters ahead. When I was eight, I was experimented on sexually by my mother's other child which led to penetration. When I told my mom about it, I asked her if it was normal. She said it wasn't but then told me I needed to forget it happened and never tell anyone because I could ruin her other child's reputation. At the time, she was married to a religious dictator who was probably the result of an abusive childhood as well (mom told me stories of when she wa s also abused) but I digress. \n\nGrowing up was a nightmare. I was abused by the dictator (kissing and fondling, thankfully, it didn't go further than that; he stopped it, believe it or not). During puberty, I become anorexic and depressive. Three situations I recall: one night, I was sulking in my room for some reason and wouldn't come to the kitchen to have supper. My mom stormed into my room, grabbed me by my hair and threw me to the floor. I hid under the bed while her newest spouse (a crackhead and serial cheater, I found out) tried to reason with her. She told me to get out of her house. This happened two more times if I recall correctly. \n\nBut I am safely out of there now and have been on my own with my husband (we met in high school and got married last year after ten years together). The point is, my mom triggers me anytime I see her or see she left me an email. And I feel intense guilt about it. Like, I should love her and feel comfortable around her. She's my mom, the woman who fed me, clothed me, gave up so much for me. At least that's what is shoved down my throat every day and I just want to know if I'm over-reacting to what happened. I've tried to forgive her, but I personally don't want anything to do with her and I know if that gets out, I will be shunned or demonized. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant and length. I just want to know if someone else has been through this or if someone can give me an outsider's perspective. If this doesn't belong here, I can delete it (or whatever reddit does, not a big user).",

If one were to look into the souls of narcissists, you would begin to smell the sulfur and feel the heat of the flames licking behind their eyes.\n\nHistory is the struggle of the just versus the tyrant. Those who grew up with NPD family members have a unique skill, in that we can sniff out the tyrants who go undetected in the larger society. In an instant, we can see past a narcissists mask, into the depths of their being.

It was our turn. Back door got kicked in, deadbolt didn't even slow them down. My roomie had missed them by about 20 minutes.\n\nThey ended up stealing my laptop, his Switch, and raided our fridge.

I felt guilty when the cops came by. I felt guilty telling the neighbors and my friends. I felt guilty asking my boss for the day off to take care of the profoundly broken back door.  I felt ashamed that a bad thing had happened to me... even though I couldn't think of ANYTHING else I could have done to prevent it, aside from quitting my job and being a hermit.\n\nSo... yeah.

I'm aware of it now, I'm dealing with it far better... but honestly, I'd rather be angry or scared or upset.\n\nI'm tired of my default setting being 'guilt'.",

        "text": "I am 24y female who moved back into my mother and grandmothers house after moving out at 18. I moved out becuase life with them was unbearable and back then I thought all out problems were my fault (thats what they were telling me) so I moved out beause I didn't know how to make life at home tolerable for them while still being my own person. \n\nMy mother is one of those mothers who never lets her children out of sight. Think \"Carrie\" and \"Black Swan\" type mothers. She was involved and controling in EVERY thing I did as a child. When I started trying to break away from her when I was twelve and that made her start saying that I had a bad attitude. Maybe so but I had no freedom and desperatley unable to express any opinion that opposed hers. If I disagreed on anything no matter how small she would act hurt. For a long time I just agreed with whatever she said to avoid the pained look in her eyes whenever I said something \"wrong.\"  \n\nWhen I talk to her now most of the time she is unable to listen to me and I can already see that she has something to say before I am done talking. That is not a horrible thing and I know a lot of people do it but I am tired of being the only one in my family attempting to have a conversation to get to know the other people. I ask fun open questions (how was your day? What did you like about it?), mirror body language, listen, ask for clarification, and respond to what the other person says. Where as my family only asks closed interrogation style questions (did you take out the trash? are you going to class?), if they want you to agree with them. They show no interest in me, they are interested in what I do so they can gossip to others but I feel irritated with them.  \n\nSo should I try to explain how to have a conversation to them? I think they do deep down WANT to connect with me but on the other hand it really feels like they just want my attention and I make conversations fun so I feel like I am being taken advantage of every time I talk to them\n\nI can admit that I can be similar to them and used to be EXACTLY like them and when I lived with other girls in an apartment for a while they handled me well.  I (regretfully) did have a bad attitude with them so they were polite but very distant with me. When having a conversation with me they would talk over me because I didn't know how to have a conversation. I appreciate getting that lesson, that if you are not enjoying a conversation that I don't have to pretend that I am. I keep it in mind that I can be a decent person even if I am not submitting to every whim another person has.\n\nMy mother taught me opposite lesson of \"don't talk to strangers.\" She used to tell me that I have to smile and talk to everyone who talks to me otherwise they might feel bad. Also I was supposed to let everyone give me a hug, take money from me, and say anything to me without any problem. This type of lesson seems like a good way to lead a girl who will someday be a young woman into some bad situations and there were many times I did things that I didn't want to do because I didn't want to hurt anyones feelings. And I end up blaming myself for them because I feel like I should have known better than getting into that situation.  I thank god that I didn't get kidnapped and murdered with all the things I've done that could have put me in danger. I am a bit in shock about some things in my life. I have depression, anxiety, am scared of talking to people, but I still want to do the right thing.\n\nI get exhausted thinking about trying to help my parents get better because I don't think my mother can until she quits smoking cigarettes. She uses it as an excuse anytime she has an emotional outburst and gets out of control.  \n\nTL;DR: Any advice would be appreciated on how to deal with parents who demand attention, comfort, patience, emotional support while offering none of that in return.\n",

        "text": "I just wanted to put this somewhere. \n\n**Birth - Age 18:** Living under the roof of nMom and eDad. I am the SG, younger brother is the GC/Flying Monkey/Grew up to be a N. Battling with depression and self harm. \n\n**Age 18:** Moved out one month after my birthday. Yes it was under the guise of going to college. Immediately went LC. Saw a counsellor for the first time to deal with depression/coming to terms with what I went through.\n\n**Age 19:** Temporarily dropped out of college. Came home briefly. Things were EVEN WORSE than before. Immediately re-enrolled in college and went back to LC. (I don't really talk about this period...to be honest I block it out unless you directly ask).\n\n**Age 20:** Start seeing a counsellor again. nMom realizes she is losing control and begins to work double time to try and keep me under her thumb (even though I no longer live with her and have a life of my own).\n\n**Age 21:** Meet the guy I now consider my 'college sweetheart'. Come home for a Christmas visit. Abuse is worse than ever. In the wake of that visit, I go NC for the first time. This lasts a few short months. I break down with the promises of things being 'different'. Graduate college. Maintain LC.\n\n**Age 22:** Break up with college sweetheart. Instead of crumbling and running home to nMom, I move in with roommates and maintaining LC and my separate life. nMom can no longer maintain the charade, and goes back to old ways. Things are worse than ever. I meet the man who is now my husband.\n\n**Age 22 - Age 25:** Maintain LC. Suffer from severe anxiety attacks even after a simple phone call with nMom. Diagnosed with Anxiety &amp; Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia and Fibromyalgia. It is believed these are a direct correlation to the abuse I suffered.\n\n**Age 25:** I get engaged. I try to 'build a bridge' with my parents by inviting them to be a part of the wedding planning process (a BIG mistake). We bump up to 'medium contact' (still less than what I'd consider 'regular contact'). nMom is worse than I've ever seen her. She alternates between micromanaging the wedding planning, and begging me to break up with my fiancé.\n\n**Age 26:** nMom finally takes things too far. I finally put my foot down. In the wake of this, she tries to play one of her head games and tells me SHE is instigating NC. I refuse to play her game, but go along with the NC. After a few days she realizes I am not playing and spends several months harassing me with phone calls, texts, messages via social media, letters to my home. Whenever I'd block a number, she'd convince someone else to let her use their phone. I had to block everyone in my family and extend the NC to my whole family. I sent letters back unopened. I changed my privacy settings on all social media (and blocked everyone), so it would be impossible for her to spy on me. In the span of five short months I replanned my wedding from scratch.\n\n**Age 27:** Get married. Not a single member of my family is in attendance. Husband and I purchase our first condo. Moving to a different place makes me feel safer because there is no risk of them showing up on my doorstep. Join Reddit specifically to join RBN support group.\n\n**Age 28:** Unrelated to NC, but I switch jobs. It's a relief knowing they won't show up at my work to cause a scene. Later that year give birth to our first child.\n\n**Age 29 AKA Now:** Pregnant with second child, and a Stay at home Mom. OCCASIONALLY get the feeling of maybe I should contact...but I always talk myself out of it. If nMom found out she was a Grandmother, she would NEVER let me go again!\n\nTL;DNR: LC for eight years. One failed attempt at NC during that time. Been NC for two years and counting now.",

        "text": "So fair warning, this is a pretty long and rambling text post. I kind of just needed to get it all out so it may not even be fully coherent but I had a really shitty past few weeks and I just need some support. \n\nBackstory: \n\nI'm an only child and my mother is a narcissist. It was just us two. My mother has always been verbally and physically abusive. She was most likely addicted to narcotics at one point (for many years) and uses her (genuine) health issues in all possible was in order to always make her the victim in any situation ever. She also had a rough(er than mine) upbringing and never got over it. Unsurprisingly, its bled into her parenting and I could probably spend days describing all the fucked up things that've happened. Instead I'll give what I think are the important bits. I attended many many schools from pre k - gr 12. Upwards of 15 but I don't feel like taking the time to count all right now. We moved around A LOT. One of those moves was from Canada to the US; something I'm still incredibly bitter about and would rather not get into that downwards spiral that dwelling on it leads to.  I had a very unstable home life. In fact we didn't even always have a home. For the better part of a year we were homeless and in a shelter. Not once but TWICE. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and chronic depression. During HS I spent weeks in the ICU and then just over a month in an adolescence psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt in HS (I was 16) that's never really been fully dealt with personally and I don't even want to get into how shittily my mother handled it. Tldr according to her is I'm selfish and spitefully tried to kill myself in order to guilt, shame, anger, embarrass, etc. her. \n\nSkip forward to now. \n\nI am currently in a really good relationship. We met online and have been together for years. We live together and a proposal is on the very near horizon, we're practically common law at this point. He is incredibly good to me and is very supportive. He accepts my baggage and wants to help me become a better, less broken person. Our relationship isn't perfect (and really who's is?) but we love each other. I'll refer to him as J. \n\nIn December I had to drop out of University more than half way through my degree for a combination of financial and mental health reasons. It was the best decision but I still have mixed up feelings about it. Mostly I just feel like a failure. In January I moved across the country \nI do currently have a job and I enjoy it but it's part time and I really need to get off my ass and get a second one. It covers rent and basic stuff but it's reaaally pay cheque to pay cheque for me right now. J has a good stable job and is honestly basically supplementing me right now (doesn't help the failure feelings + I feel like a burden). I have tons of debt (cannot transfer Uni until balance is paid off, I'm at least two years away from being able to go back to school and that's assuming I get a second job very very soon. There are literally three employees (myself included) + owners &amp; bakers/chefs; so my job isn't exactly bursting with social options. \n\nLiving situation as of February of this year: \nMe + J \nRoommate (C from here on out) \nWe're all on the lease of a two bedroom apartment and split it all equally in three.\n\nIn regards to the birth giver situation: I'm low contact and moving to the other coast has vastly improved our relationship. It's not great. Not good even. But bearable... for once. \n\nNow onto the reason for today's rant. \nI just feel so alone and empty all the time. I thought moving across the country to be with the only supportive person I have in my life would make these feelings stop. I thought it was supposed to get better. \n\nNow don't get me wrong. It is better. And I know it is. But why am I still so lonely? Why do I feel so bad inside? I got out! I made a new life out from under my Nmom's grasp. I should be ecstatic all the time. Everything should be fucking awesome. But here I am. \n\nI feel as if my lack of support system is becoming overwhelming. And it's my own fault. My mother isn't here to prevent me from making friends anymore. This is on me. I feel like I'm not good enough. I've never really had friends tbh. I had a a few ( and were talking count on one hand few) people I thought were friends but either it ended badly or it just became superficial. The latter has happened way more often than I care to remember. Moving around so much it's hard to keep in contact and the very few I did keep in touch with are not real friendships. We wish each other hbd and like each other's stuff on social media. Sometimes there'll be an exchanging of \"I miss you's\" but it's all very shallow. We don't really know each other any more; if we ever even really did to begin with. \n\nJ on the other hand has: \nA big immediate family \nAn even larger extended family\nHS friends \nWork friends \nSchool/ Extra curricular friends \nVarious other friends he's made since being an adult\nEtc. \n\nJ tries really hard to include me. I know he does. But it's not enough. I enjoy spending time with J's sisters but I've only ever really hung out with them with J present. I've asked to go to a movie or whatever a few times over the last two weeks but due to varying schedules and their own lives happening it hasn't happened.  J &amp; I  have a core group we hang out with pretty regularly comprised of a few of his HS friends (C included) as well as friends that joined as adults. I am the only female in this group. With the exception of one other person in the outer ring of the core group, none of them have girlfriends so there's always that base layer of discomfort. Depending which friends, sometimes it's very low. With others it's pretty obvious to me that I'm just J's gf and they'd rather I weren't present. Keep in mind pretty much everyone hangs out at out apartment because it's the most accessible; clean, not a parent's place, etc. (Age range is from me being the youngest at a month shy of 21 to late twenties with most being 23-24). I feel like I go out of my way to be friendly and it doesn't make a difference. There's only one or two people in the group other than my bf that treat me like a real person and not just J's gf. I've made an effort to converse with them. I started watching tv shows and movies that I've grown to genuinely enjoy because I wanted to find common ground with them. I try to be a good host and have feed them from my own pocket (sometimes I cook and sometimes I just provide snacks-not every single time people are over but it happens) and only once out of those times have I ever really felt like they were appreciative. I clean up after them and don't complain about the messes they leave. They come over unannounced and we graciously entertain them (J is trying to really nip that behaviour in the bud and request prior notification if people want to hang out). I genuinely want these people to like me and I feel like I'm failing and I have no friends of my own so I feel even more like a failure when they reject me. \n\nSo quick explanation of my relationship with C. We met during J's second trip to visit me back when we were still LDR and from them I got the distinct feeling he disliked me. I've mentioned it many a time to J over the years and he's been pretty dismissive of it. Well last week while I was at work J&amp; C apparently had some kind of heart to heart (we had a few general issues with C as a roommate lately; cleanliness, passive aggression, etc.) during which C flat out said he dislikes me and thinks I'm annoying. I always figured he did but having it confirmed feels really shitty. Plus, J now finally believes me and has apologized for being so dismissive about it before. Since then I've felt so uncomfortable in my own home. I knew C avoided me when it was just the two of us at home and in turn I also avoided him but he'd always join J&amp;I in the living room to hang out basically daily. It just feels slimy to me that he will basically insert himself into our conversations and stuff. Like why do that if he dislikes me as much as he claims? Why even move in with us? It wasn't like I moved into their place. The three of us actively apt hunted until we found our place. I thought that meant he didn't actually hate me. But nope. He still does, he just can't get a place on his own. Some of the group are his specifically his friends and they all treat me like I'm inferior. I've always gotten a weird vibe from that part of the group but J assured me I was fine and that it wasn't so much that they disliked me but rather they weren't used to having a girl around. (Um hello, why the fuck hang out at my apartment then. Like I pay rent and bills here. You don't. Fuck off and stop making me feel like I'm being intrusive for simply being in my own fucking home.) I also can't always tell when they're \"joking\" and they're been some hurtful things said that they are obviously meant to sting but delivered in such a way that they can \"just a joke bro, stop being so sensitive/ such a girl\". \nI don't want to stop C from hanging out with his friends. But I want to be able to watch tv in the living room without wishing I could implode or crawl into my own chest cavity and hide. \nAll of this has been especially overwhelming lately and it's compounded by the lack of my own social circle. I feel so worthless and like I don't even deserve friendship. I don't even know why J keeps me around. I know he could do better and it's obvious most of his friend think so as well. I'm also a minority and everyone else is white (with the exception of J's best friend who is black&amp; white mixed- he is also the only one who consistently treats me like a real person with valuable thoughts and opinions) which I'm sure plays a large role in this. It's mostly kept pc but I've heard some pretty racist things being said and even if they don't specifically mention my race I know if I weren't there and they didn't want to offend J then they would be more open about disliking people of my culture. \n\nI'm sorry. I don't even know what I hoped to accomplish with this monster text post. I've probably just rambled on and no one even cares. I don't even know what the point was. I don't know what to do. I don't know what my main complaint was. I don't know how to not be someone clearly too annoying to be around. I don't know what to do period. I just want to hide. I wish I could turn off majority of the time and just be turned on when my bf is around and able to spend uninterrupted time with me. I sound like such a pathetic person. I wish I were someone else. I wish people liked me. I wish my life had been different. Please help me. I'm so lost. ",

I think about what her job is and am constantly worried about running into this person who I dont even know their name. It drives me crazy. I tried to call him Monday to see if I could use his extra truck because I'm without a vehicle now and he ignored my calls twice. So i know he was with her. When we talk on the phone there is genuine love and friendship there and he says that no one but us will ever understand our relationship. Been back and forth with him 7 year, got with him when I was newly clean off heroin and homelessness just for a little background. Helppp. I'm in therapy too by the way. ",

        "text": "So I've been living a few states away from my family for years. This has been good because boundaries have been very natural and there are so many excuses to use when you're that far away. But I'm potentially moving only a couple hours away from them. I'm torn because one of my siblings has kids and I don't want to hurt her family by not being there for birthday parties (etc.) when I could. And also I want to be there for the kids if they do something that would make my family cut them off (like coming out). However, I'm making myself sick thinking about how to interact with my parents and other family. For years I've been the bigger person (mostly because of others guilt-ing me about it). I go into an interaction, like a wedding, being optimistic and trying to maintain the peace. But I think I'm just hurting myself (and my spouse).  Overall my family is full of bad people - they're manipulative and verbally abusive. They're homophobic, racist, sexist, etc. They're the type of people that have literally taken the side of father molesting his child instead of helping the victim. They told me I wasn't good enough to be their daughter about 8 years ago and they haven't shown any signs of positive change since then. \n\nThat being said - how do I create concrete boundaries if I'm going to be that close? The last few years I've been trying to be proactive about asserting myself instead of letting them lead the interaction, it just doesn't seem to work. And I start to have panic attacks because they have to be in control. If I invite them over for breakfast they decide that we're all going to go driving around instead. They talk to my husband about me in third person while I'm there. I can't decide if I should actually write out rules and give it to them, ignore them completely, or what. The problem is that they are still on good terms with my other family so if I'm \"mean\" to my parents my other family is going to call me out about it. I almost don't want to even tell anyone that I'm moving close, but then it sounds like I'm being purposefully hurtful.  ",

I always thought my mom was just BPD, but my therapist believes she's BPD/NPD co-morbid. I thought it was just Fleas? She's also showing signs of possible alzheimer's/dementia, and she's only 62. I'm devastated. \n\nI alternate between VLC/LC with her, she has good days and bad days with her behavior. She's completely unpredictable. I've had her on a heavy, heavy info diet and I've been practicing gray rocking. I'm good at it. She's noticed I've gotten more distant and it's so painful to hear about it from my other family. And yet I stay the course.\n\nEverything in me just wants to be frank. I wish I could tell her why I'm doing the things I am, and she asks all the time. I want to grab her by her shoulders and just tell her, 'I know you remember every instance where you've been horrible to me. You were straight up abusive. I'm not here to argue, I'm here to answer your question. Because of that I have to protect myself. I have to protect my family and my babies. They can't ever have alone time with you, because I can't be assured you won't scream at them or panic over nothing, or punish them on the spot over made up offenses because it makes you feel powerful and in control or whatever your bullshit reasons are. The good times don't make up for that. We're grateful for the gifts you give when you have mentally healthy days, but I wish you didn't give them out of guilt over your bad days. I wish you didn't treat spending money like most people treat recreational drugs. I wish you didn't treat calories with the same push/pull of a recovering alcoholic trying to be moderate. It's hard to watch, and upsetting to take part in some of those meals.\n\nBUT MOST OF ALL I wish I didn't feel like I have to explain this to a 60 year old woman. I wish you were self aware. I wish you could sooth yourself when you feel panicked, instead lashing out at everyone present. It's like watching someone drown in two feet of water, and then pulling down the people trying to help. Holding them under the water, using their flailing to justify your fear. \n\nI wish I could say all of this to you and have you understand. I don't want an apology, I don't want amends. I want you be normal. I want a mother I can talk to about my insecurities and doubts as a mother myself. I want a mother I can pray with, one who I can tell when I'm going into labor. A mother who would be there for me and support me, rather than make it about herself then attack me viciously for having the audacity to feel hurt by that. Because that's the solution to people you've hurt: attack them more.\"\n\nThe list of my impossible wishes goes on and on. Instead of getting any of those things, or even telling her about those things, I sit on the phone for a brief call to tell her absolutely nothing is new or going on before asking about her garden and church, then making an excuse to hang up. It's miserable.\n",

I longed for stability and a nice place to live and work for years to come. Instead, in the last 12 years, I've bounced around from apartment to apartment and job to job. My anxiety often ended up getting me fired. You know, that self-sabotaging thing us ACON's do where we're SURE we going to mess up, and get so anxious about it, we end up messing up? Yeah. Me in almost every job.\n\nI've been in counseling for almost a full year straight now, and I started Lexapro back in February. Both have helped tremendously. But it's a double edged sword. While I finally found a guy and an apartment I want to be with long term (till we buy a house, then bye apartment hello wonderful home life). But it's made me realize I kind of hate my job. I've been there three years, and it's just really sunk in that i'm in a dead end job. I'm paid extremely low for the amount of work I do and I am bullied by my supervisor constantly. If it's not her way, it's wrong. There's no room for my ideas here. No room for me to do things in a way that make sense to me or make me more comfortable. They've been a few times I just sit at my desk and cry because the anxiety gets bad.\n\nI wanted to stay here long term until I finished my degree and went on to bigger better things. I was hoping I could move up in the ranks at least a little bit and get paid more. But none of that has happened, despite me asking for it. I've honestly been considering taking FMLA leave just to get a freaking break from this place and my supervisor. \n\nI have applied for a job at the school i want to go to for grad school. It's way more money, involves some fun travel, and it's something I really want and would be good at. It would also help me get into their extremely competitive program. I interviewed a month ago, and have periodically been checking in. They're still interviewing candidates, and are hoping to make a final decision in the next two weeks. I'm praying to every source that I get this job.\n\nBut at the same time, if I don't, I Think in the next year, I'm going to quit my job and just go to school full time. Finish faster. But I'm always worried in the back of my brain that I am just broken. That I struggle with long term commitments. That I'm always going to find something wrong with something. My Narc Mom used to complain that I was too nit-picky when I just thought I realized the problems in a situation, fixed them if i could, and moved on if I couldn't.\n\nI'm just worried I'll always feel this way. This \"I'm never happy\" brain fog which is a combination of me always wanting more out of life and depression fog.\n\nI'm happy where I live. I'm happy in my 3+ year relationship. That's gotta mean something, right?",

        "text": "Hey guys.\n\nI'm in a poly relationship, have been for 4 years now, and it's one of the best, most healing, happiest things that I've done in my life. \n\nThat's necessary background info for how my N-ex worked.\n\nLet's say BF is my BF, N-ex is self explanatory. \n\nBF was long distance but comes to visit me a few times in a year, but I finally moved out from my N-parents place last December and we live together almost all of the time.\n\nLast summer, I got into a relationship with N-ex. He seemed like an amazing, awesome, caring, quiet guy who was so kind to me and hung out with me all the time, nearly 24/7 when I was out of a job. His place was a refuge from my N-parents so we'd spend weeks together with the blessing of my chosen (poly) family.\n\nAll was well for 2 months, then N-ex made me cry every night for 4 months straight, tried to break apart my relationship with my chosen family and isolate me. None of it worked and I'm here now, being NC since December when BF moved in with me.\n\nI have a slight problem… N-ex is at every event I go to. We're in a pretty close knit local community (please don't judge; furries) and they've been essential to me learning how to socialize and be at events without having CPTSD breakdowns. I had 0 friends before joining that local community; they've been inviting and given me a structured, happy thing to do at least twice a month where I get to go out and socialize and have a good time.\n\nI've been doing a pretty good job of NC with N-ex. Got some info from the community; turns out he moved on less than a week after I left him for someone new and vulnerable. Helped them escape him so he moved onto their 17 year old cousin (he's 10 years older than her). He's her first relationship; he's going to destroy her view of a lot of things but I've realized that there's nothing I can do in that situation so I don't (I'm not his keeper). \n\nProblem is I have to see him about once a month, in person, at these 20-200 people meetups. Not going to the meets isn't an option (It's the only place I get to wear my many thousands of dollars of suits, relax, and be myself). His presence unsettles me, but it's not the worst thing in the world. I pretend he doesn’t exist, he pretends I don't exist. BF and my friends support me and are very much there for me when they see me shaking after nearly running into him (something that happened yesterday). He broods and scowls and it seems like he's gone from being a big popular guy to only being able to hang out with 2 other people because most of the local community are my friends, too. He kept the relationship secret (so he could still flirt with other ladies in the city and make sure he had them ready for when I left him) but when I left him I made sure to tell my friends the truth so he couldn't smear me. Nothing bad, just that we were in a relationship and he was not nice to me so I am not in contact with him now.\n\nHe's pulling a FM hoovering trick now.\u000b\u000bhttp://i.imgur.com/CbMFMhN.png\n\nHere's what I'm asking advice on:\n\nI'm not going to leave that community; it means far too much to me. I'm just wondering how you guys would approach this. Should I continue hard NC, eventually desensitizing myself to his presence and finding my inner peace?\n\n…ha, I think I just answered my own question.\n\nThe other option I was weighing was to tell the FM that I'd only consider even looking in his direction if he \"apologized\" to me (I know it wouldn't be sincere, of course - he'd do it in a heartbeat if he could hoover me). I'm the one who initiated NC, not him. I have very strong reasons for it and the only reason I'd ask for that is so that we could have a \"nod in acknowledgement\" type of relationship at these events. Not acknowledging his presence seems to be really bothering him.\n\nTL;DR: Have an N-ex, am NC with him, we go to all the same events. Continue hard NC/pretending he doesn't exist?",

        "text": "Hi there. I recently cut ties with a friend that I made a couple years ago because I realized that while they were fun and outgoing and free spirited (all things I'm not, wish I was, and gravitate towards in friends) I often lost my individuality around them and often took on their ideals and convictions. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've also noticed that I seem to be addicted to a particular kind of attention. The friend I cut ties with used to text me constantly and I absolutely loved it. Even worse, I recently emotionally cheated on my husband with someone who constantly sent me texts, pictures, and spent as much time with me as they possibly could. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor background, my father and his mother (my grandmother) are narcissists and they both took turns raising me because my dad would often drop me off with her for weeks at a time. I was often neglected and isolated growing up. I have an anxiety disorder, ptsd from my experience with my father, and a desperate need for love and attention. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDoes anyone else find themselves having this issue? Do you know how to combat it or have you found a way to get this need fulfilled in a healthy way? Is it possible for someone like me to have a healthy relationship with someone that has a strong personality? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks in advance for any responses. ",

Her favorite thing to do when I was stuck living with her was to attack me verbally, saying horrible things to me and about me (including threats and gossiping/lying on the phone loudly so I could hear her) as soon as my fella left the house. My biggest fear is that she would show up, intentionally say something upsetting to me or make up a lie and pass it around our mentally stable guests to ruin our big day together.

It was really stupid when they brought up something from 4 years ago when we barely even knew each other, and it was really just blatant evidence of how simplistic, stupid, and pathological they were.\n\nThey had gotten angry over nothing, playing a video game with their friend, and were standing in the middle of the living room, ranting and raving, all pissed off. \n\n\"...No! This is bullshit!...\" \n\n...\n\nYeah.\n\nI basically just told him in a really calm matter to look at himself and realize that he was standing in the middle of the living room making a scene and no one was really paying attention to him because everyone had just gotten used to this behavior after he tried to deflect that shit onto me.\n\nIt worked. He went back to his room after calming down instantly. Simple as that.\n\nThe secret of course, is weed. Lots of weed. \n\nAlso, I doubt this would work if you were being explicitly targeted, as they are oblivious, you'd need a partner/friend who you can always have by your side to also act as you would during one of their episodes for when they explicitly target you.\n\nI'm not a marijuana junky, but if it helps, I don't see any reason not to do it, if it works for you. I sincerely recommend smoking to help to heal yourself from the abuse. I know it probably sounds dumb, but it works, and we don't exactly have a lot of choices. Also, I don't really believe in god, but praying actually seemed to work for me, as much as I hate to admit it. o///o \n\nSo... yeah. Try that out. I'm already broken as a person. They took and raped my mind. I have nothing left. But maybe it will help some of you.\n",

        "text": "Title says it all.\n\nI'm tired of exploitive landlords and narcissists. I've noticed a trend in this sub (and in my generation in general) on the struggles of surviving without parental support.\n\nI've lived on my own twice before, and had to move back in with Nparents due to terrible wages and rising rents. Going back to an Nparent home because of a financial cornering is a special kind of mental hell.\n\nI had to move last time because of black mold poisoning. I've been living in my car, and eventually in a friend's mom's basement. It turns out she's a narcissist too, and is controlling and abusive.\n\nI'm just tired of it all. I can't think straight. My mind is foggy all the time. Every day is a blur of desperation and isolation.\n\nI've been looking on Craigslist and Zillow for months. Every rent available is 60% of my income. Everyone I talk to in the area has made the same conclusions. Everyone I know in their 20's literally can not escape their parent's houses.\n\nAll I need is a place to sleep, free from constant bootstrapping \"when I was your age\" bullshit, \"my house my rules\" bullshit, creepy parents/landlords digging through your trash -- free from all that bullshit.\n\nI'm asking if there is anyone here with a spare room, spare corner, spare closet, that I can live in. Someone who understands the influence of a narcissist parent/landlord, literally trying to control your life, and the stress that brings.\n\nI can offer up to $300 a month. I have/buy all my own toiletries, food, clothes. I have a sleeping bag and not afraid of sleeping on a floor. All I am asking is literally some empty space I can just exist without guilt.\n\nI just need a place I can take a nap and shower at, without being berated, yelled at, demanded of, assaulted, belittled, and generally controlled.\n\nI've been through 3 years of therapy already. I've already dealt with my fleas, healed my self doubt, etc etc. But no amount of personal therapy magically lifts you from your economic reality. I'm a poor working class individual, from a poor family, in a rust belt town that has been dominated by Walmart and Amazon.\n\nI have a wife in Canada who is working a good salary job, full healthcare, dental, etc. But due to immigration laws, it'll be a couple more months before I can move there with her. We're processing the paperwork now.\n\nI have full financial support from myself and a wife, thousands of dollars in savings, but due to my \"low income\" not being 3 times the rent prices, I can't get an a apartment.\n\nIn the meantime, I need to live, work, eat, and get away from controlling exploitative people. Just for a couple of months, tops. I just need a little relief and quiet, so I can get level headed enough to think straight again.\n\nIf anyone here has a spare room and a heart, please, please, lend me a hand.",

        "text": "I'm sick, alone, hungry, half starved for long time(long before leaving), fatigued, soon will run out of money for hostel bed, have no social safety net, need a low carb and other specifics diet for health reasons, which is expensive. Yes, I left my abusive family with no plan and no options, but I had to. I couldn't come up with anything while living with them, it was too bad to be able to think, and each day spent there was making things only worse, and not bringing me closer to solutions. I still have fatigue, brain fog, malnourishment and health problems, so it's still hard to think clear. I left them a bit more than a week ago, managed not to cause open conflict(wrote a letter for mother, full of lies, false \"I love you's\" and soothing manipulations. She agreed to let me go, acted supportive. I don't doubt that she only did so because she believes I won't manage it on my own and will come back, that already happened once, but that works for me just fine right now, what matters is that she won't start shit at least for a while. But I need to manage to survive, like she thinks I won't, because coming back is not an option. Is it bad to manipulate a manipulator? I don't even care. If I need to win a mind game to get free from mind games, so I will). So far I've accomplished nothing. Okay, I got some sleep that's a bit better than at home. \nAnd I don't know what to do. I need money, and I need a way that I can be sure will work. And I need money now, not after a month or two. I have never had a job in my life. I'm terribly weak right now. I have adhd, which is fine usually, but now it's worse than ever. Speaking with people gives me so bad anxiety, that I come off as a rude, shaky weirdo - and I have anxiety because I already look unacceptable. I know I'd have less anxiety if I recovered a bit, I'm not  naturally that anxious person. I look like shit, I'm scared that I leave an impression of a homeless drug addict(I technically am homeless, a hostel isn't a home, but no, I don't do drugs, I don't even smoke cigarettes or drink). I have very cheap, stupid clothes, I can't walk that straight, lose focus a lot, forget words, can't pay attention, have suspocious bruises on my arms(it's hot as hell, I suppose I could wear that shitty long sleewed shirt that's really my mother's blouse if I must, but mostly I don't), am hypervigilant which sometimes makes me rude if I feel threatened, and can't stop fidgeting. Literally any earning method needs to pay taxes where I live, even setting up a water selling stand. It's not that I'm mad about giving away a part of what I would earn, but I can't do any paperwork right now, I can't even read about taxes to understand what I should do to not accidently evade them, it's so boring that I'm absolutely incapable to focus on it, so I don't understand it at all. I definitely can't be employed, I'd only qualify for menial work that I can't do, because it's either physical, or boring, or both, and I'm weak and can't do boring. Self employment or freelancing is the only possibility, but that means paperwork, and I can't do it now. I probably could get through some paperwork, or find someone to do it for me, if I knew for sure what I will do to make money, but right now I'm frantically trying to think of what to do, and end up not coming up with any ideas that I can hold onto for more than an hour. It's the lack of clarity that makes this so bad, because I know I can't afford to fail. If I spend time and energy to try to do a thing that ends up not working, I'll have wasted all my money - not because that thing requires investment, but because I'm paying for hostel and buying some food. But, the more time I spend in doubt, the more I waste with no chances at all. And most of time I can hardly get up from the bed. \nThere's no more wellfare or social help I could get, I already get about €100 per month, which isn't enough to survive, and I've looked through all of the info, there's nothing more I can apply for. Soup kitchens give food I can't eat, and I will not go to any homeless shelters, thank you very much, they're terrible. And it's not that I even want wellfare. I just want some clarity for what I can do myself. \nI'm not sure what advice I'm asking for. I just want someone with a clearer head to look at my situation, and tell me if they see something I can't. \nTl;dr : I've left abuse, live in a hostel, struggle to survive. Can't ask for any more social help, have gotten all I can apply for(yes, not even this or that thing you thought of). Am physically exhausted, overstressed, sick, starved, to nearly falling - can't do physical work right now, I need to rest and preserve energy to recover, not exercise a lot. I have adhd and social anxiety(social anxiety is probably temporary, I have it because I don't appear too respectable or normal right now, getting better would change that). I suck at paperwork because it's too boring to concentrate, and probably would fuck up cashier or similar work for the same reason. Online work would be the best option for me, because no one sees me looking like shit and losing focus all the time, and because I can lay down while doing it. I'd prefer self employment if possible, at least that's what I'll go for in long term.\nEdit: added tl;dr, because I know it's hard to pay attention through texts too long, so people give advice that doesn't really take into account all I said.",

I was just waiting for my bus and she suddenly appeared in her car at another side of the road and waved at me energetically. I was dreading a situation like that might occur eventually, but at the moment I thought just \"eh, whatever, what might happen\" and came to talk. She gave me a ride to the place I was going to anyway.\nShe was... how do I put it... Much friendlier to me than I might have expected? Maybe those are N-charms, I dunno. At the same time, I think she didn't reflect AT ALL during this year. All she said about me leaving the house is \"Why didn't you contact us\", \"Don't be so mad\" and \"I'm your mother, I wish all the best for you\". This soured all her attempts at friendliness. She said to me \"it's either you help me, or get the fuck out of here\", pulled on my hair, beat me in the corner, called me, my SO and my friends some names, but somehow it's still MY fault for not wanting to contact her? But I still hugged her goodbye and kissed on a cheek. Why? I don't know, either. \nShe asked me to visit their family (E-stepdad, younger brother and sister, N-grandmom who's probably going soon of age) at least once until I leave for my uni. For some tea and stuff I guess. Should I do that or shouldn't I?  The thing is, I'm leaving this town in a week, and this country in a month to study abroad for a year. After that, I'm not sure when I'm coming here next time, if at all. NMom seems pretty reasonable if I keep communicating her at the decent distance. Do any of you have experience in similar situation? Is it possible to keep a relationship with a NParent, while also keeping a distance?",

Her family I used to be close with I can't talk to anymore as their views on certain things make me very uncomfortable. (My ex was a non practicing Muslim and her parents took my becoming more outspoken politics as me being anti-white (I'm half, so dafuq?) He wasn't even as political as me and had opposing views when we met.) I'm still friends with them all on Facebook which is stressful. \n\nMy other best friend, while not as long of a friendshp she is supportive and would actually work to make my wedding better, has recently cut \"best friend\" A out of her life due to her manipulative selfish hurtful bullshit.\n\nI have no idea who I can invite from. My family to the wedding. My mother's family are abusive and misogynistic. My dad's family I don't know how to feel about. My father pushed his family away when his dad passed. My mother always told me they were catty and backstabbing (though she has a huge persecution complex.) \n\nNone of them came to my high school graduation so I doubt any would attend my wedding. (My closest family members live 6 hours away but I had family in town when I graduated.) I have three brothers. One of them was another target of my mother's but he's still loyal and beyond that his drug abuse and the fact that I've been hounded by debt collectors cut him from the list. My darling nephews I can't imagine my wedding without, but my brother and his wife are separated. My brother is likely to share information about the wedding to my mother (she babysits and has already begun referring to the older boy as a demon like she did to me.) Not to mention from things I witnessed and confirmed with my sister in law, my brother is abusive. He has bad PTSD which he refuses to get help for. My younger brother is hit or miss but I worryb he gave my parents my previous number against his promise not to.\n\nTldr; I don't know who I can trust and who I can invite to my  wedding. I havent been to a wedding in at least 15 years and I have no idea what I'm doing and I just needed to vent to a group who knows what it's like to have the thought of seeing your parents again fill you with so much fear that you want to vomit.

        "text": "After a fight which my therapist qualifies as emotional abuse (starting to doubt it though), I've finally left. Initially I felt so relieve knowing the manipulation would stop and that I still had my friends present. \n\nAfter a few days I went to see my family for two weeks. Through social media I saw that our group of friends and him spend a lot of time together. That's fine. Until they started being cold to my messages and elusively respond to attempts to hang out once I'll be back in town. I tried to not stress quite unsuccessfully until I came back. But since I'm home things haven't change, on the contrary it's getting worse. \n\nTalking to my sister and cousin the best idea we came up with to not loose all contact with my friends is to act as though I'm not bothered by my ex and continue to occasionally hang out so they won't feel like they have to take sides. I get along great with my ex, we used to be the closest friends even before our relationship. At some point I needed to love myself more than I loved him. And could not accept the power trips, gas lighting, shift blaming *(does this make sense, I'm not a native English speaker)*. Only now I feel like the present is far worse than before. \n\n\nI'm very scared that he said bad stuff about me. He use to say to people that his ex had cheated on him but admitted to me that he actually wasn't sure. The thing is that he's too intelligent to make it look like he's resentful.\n\n\nI don't know what I'm expecting by posting here but I feel like the floor is evaporating. I need to get it out without burdening my close ones. I doubled my anti anxiety medication and feel too emotional to speak to people more than 10min. I decided to work out everyday just three days ago. Until now I've gone but now I'm in bed shaking. \n\nI don't even know what to say or act with out group of friends the next time I'll see them. I feel so scared and alone right now. \n\n\n**tl;dr** Abandonment issues  ",

I know I'm supposed to be ashamed of our arrangement but I think it's great for all of us. I had an Nmom and a bipolar dad who committed suicide when I was 19. His Ndad passed away 9 months ago. So maybe building a family home without going broke was what we each needed?\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for nearly six years. We talk about getting married and I feel we will. We want to move somewhere more affordable than our \"cool\" hipster city. We want no kids.\n\nNone of this was how the adults in my life lived their lives. I'm rebelling, and therefore I have no template. And my Nmom is still alive.\n\nI have depression and PMDD (waiting on insurance to get a formal diagnosis and consequent meds). I have my own copywriting business, have self published 6 books and am drafting one to pitch for traditional release because I finally feel like I'm worthy of it. I'm getting my LLC this year, even though I only made 27K gross last year. I only have 19k of my student loan debt left, though I do have some credit card debt because my parents basically financially abandoned me in college.\n\nBut I feel like I'm barely moving into the sphere of where I should be at age 27. I still communicate with my Nmom because I love my three younger brothers. I feel like I'll always be behind as an adult.\n\nTLDR: I don't know how to move up to being \"normal.\" And am I making more progress than I think I am?",

        "text": "tl;dr I got the vibe that an overseas friend was drifting away and I couldn’t deal so I just stopped checking that email account 8 months ago.  Now she has sent me a letter and I’m actually afraid to open it.\n\nAlmost 20 years ago I lived overseas and made a friend there.  I came back to my home country 14 years ago.  I kept in touch with that friend.  One really nice thing she did was consistently send cards on my b-day and at Christmas.  \n\nLast year I travelled back to that country for the first time since I moved away, and visited her for a few days.  Because of my messed-up family AND history of messed-up friendships, I wondered if this was even a good idea.  She might decide she didn’t like me anymore, after seeing me in person again.  People change, people drift apart.  But it seemed OK while I was there.\n\nI returned home, and a couple months later it was my birthday and then a month later Christmas.  No cards.  There were emails though, but no mention of my birthday.  My mind went straight to “she’s gone off me, this friendship is on fade-out”.  I stopped checking the email account I always used to communicate with her (it’s old and I use others for day-to-day stuff) because I knew I couldn’t handle seeing nothing at all from her and finally get dropped.\n\nI KNOW this is irrational and based on fear.  I’ve known it the entire time I’ve been doing it.  But it didn’t help.\n\nI received a card from her in the mail this week. \n\nA normal person would think she is just wondering if I’m OK and why I haven’t replied to her emails.  But I’m not a normal person, and unfortunately I have gotten some very toxic letters and emails from people who were deliberately trying to hurt me, so my mind is going in a million different directions.\n\nHelp!\n",

        "text": "I (24F) moved back to my mother’s house because I was struggling in my customer service job and was in a depression needing therapy. I am in therapy and my life has improved in ways I never thought possible. I was a disaster before. I was hostile, passive aggressive, resentful, and I hated life. I am still struggling with being lonely and depressed but now I see a bright future and the possibility of taking care of myself by going to college for psychology and getting a masters. That is making me realize that I am not such a failure that I used to believe. \n\nSo my problem now is that I live with my grandmother who was diagnosed by my therapist as being a narcissist. Growing up with her was hell. I had a very happy early childhood, lots of friends, and an A average in school. After my parents divorced when I was nine, my mother, sister, and I lived in an apartment for a while and our grandmother would come help often. \n\nIn those early times I remember feeling scared of my grandmother. I would HATE spending time with her. She was boring and talked about stories that had no point for hours on end and would punish for really weird things that made no sense to me as a child.  Like a game that only she knew the rules and we were supposed to be on alert the whole time, watching her and making sure that she is happy the whole time.\n\nAfter we all moved in together she got worse. My mother is very submissive to my grandmother and so my grandmother could get away with anything. Everyday getting told why I have no friends destroyed my self-esteem. My grandmother nit-picked everything my sister and I did. We always had to sit up straight, eat a certain way, do everything she wanted right when she wanted, always take her words seriously while anything we said was brushed off. She said we had bad attitudes, and in reality we were and are actually very sweet girls. I don't understand how a parent can blame everyone and their brother before taking any responsibility for their own child’s personality. My mother will blame her circumstances for why she was struggling as a mother but if I try to blame my circumstances for why I struggled with school, friends, and work she says I should grow up.  I hate that my mother depended on her abusive mother to help raise us. \n\nMy mother was abused in her youth and should have known better. But she was scared of leaving us alone at home (understandably so) but we were 12 and 15 and school was less than a ten-minute walk away. We could have managed by ourselves but my mother was scared. I can understand being afraid, I'm afraid that I can't take care of myself sometimes. But I wish she could have been brave, believed in herself and us and not moved us in with that tyrant. \n\nMy grandmother has a sadistic streak and gets off on other people feeling embarrassed, scared, lonely, sad, or angry. She will act like she cares about you so you open up and share something that is bothering you and use it against you. \n\nShe knew my acne was embarrassing so sometimes at parties in front of everyone she would bring it up or the fact that I was failing a class, or that my friends were getting straight A's and I wasn't. Anything to humiliate me.\n\n\nI am still shy and in high school I was painfully shy. It started when my grandmother told me everyday,\" the reason you don't have friends is because you don't smile,\" or, \"you don't listen,\" blah blah. The truth was that I did have friends but after hearing that I started thinking \"what if its true\" and I would get nervous and freeze up around my friends and eventually I got so uncomfortable that I stopped hanging out with people at all and spent most of my time alone in my room. I fell for my grandmother's brainwashing and I regret listening to her. If I had seen her lies for what they were at the time I wouldn't have listened to her for a second.\n\nI have seen act cruelly to other family members. She acts innocent to get close to someone to find out dirt and then if you get on her bad side she uses it to get you back. My aunt one time at Christmas yelled at my grandmother for a gift she got. To everyone there it looked like my aunt overreacted, right? But after hearing her side it was a gift my grandmother had asked my aunt if she wanted many times, \"do you want this shirt?\" My aunt said no that the shirt was against her style in some way. So when she opened the gift and there was the shirt she didn't want it was like her mother was saying that she doesn't care what her daughter wanted. She was giving the gift like a \"fuck you. I'll do what i want.\" and that is why my aunt reacted strongly to what seemed like an innocent mistake. \n\nThe VERY same thing happened to me. My grandmother asked if I wanted a translator device for months before my birthday and I said no every time. I thought it was weird that she kept asking since I had no interest in other languages at the time but she kept asking and I kept saying no. Finally my birthday came and I got the translator device which I said thank you for but later I was thinking about it and I felt angry at her for not listening to me and giving me something she knew I had no desire for. She really doesn't care about what I like she just wants the attention for giving something she thinks is great.\n\nNow I am 24 and moved back in after I had a depressive bout and quit my job because I felt displaced anger. Growing up in dysfunction I learned to never connect with other people because it was painful. I never made eye contact, never listened to other people, and always mistrusted people. Even when they said simple things like, \"I would like a mint.\" I though, \"why is this guy asking me for something? He probably wants to get money or something out of me. I can't trust him.\" This would happen with EVERY interaction I had! I would talk to someone and in two seconds I didn't trust them. That was my pathology from growing up around people I shouldn't have trusted. \n\nNow, thank god for therapy, I can go to that vulnerable place where you look someone in the eye, relax, and have a conversation where you are both connected. I cannot express what a relief and what a joy that is. It is something I never had. Both of my parents are just as avoidant as I am so my childhood was very superficial. \n\nAdvice to anyone struggling with something similar is get therapy. Nothing beats one-on-one conversation with someone who is safe and knows how to help.  I know it can be tough to afford and might seem like a waste to spend money on what seems like just talking. This is someone who went to college for at least eight years. Someone who has talked with people in a similar position to you dozens of times. He knows what works and what doesn't. And it just helps having a conversation with someone who you are paying to talk about YOU for an hour. When you have low self-esteem it can be feel like you are being rude to talk about yourself but when you are pain someone money you feel justified to take all the attention which is great for your mind and heart!!\n\nTl,DR; Rant about growing up with a narcissistic grandmother. Therapy is helping me heal from all the brainwashing torture she did to me.  \n",

        "text": "edit: NC 6 years with Ndad, VLC 1 year with e/bpdmom.\n\nMy E/BPDmom tells this story about how my ndad used to leave me alone in the house while he went places, usually all day. It started when I was six months old. My mom came home and found me in the middle of a wooden staircase crying, red-faced and sweating. She had no idea how I got there, or how long I'd been there, I could barely crawl at that point. So either I was set down in the middle of a wooden staircase or I fell/rolled. My ndad had wanted to take GC on a motorcycle ride, and so he did, you see. The way she tells that story is the whole point was how mad Ndad made her. Never did it dawn on her what I must have gone through or started learning from fucking birth on.\n\nThat's fucking child endangerment. My mom should have called the police on her shitbag husband right then and there. Instead she vowed simply to never leave me alone in the care of ndad again, which suited him just fucking fine. She talks about how hard and what a sacrifice that was for her! She couldn't go anywhere. How sad for her.\n\nThat is, until they divorced when I was 3. See, Ndad wanted custody not because he wanted us, but because he didn't want child support and did want to stick it to our mom. So he got split custody because my BPDmom is a fucking waif, who said \"there was nothing she could do\". Don't you see she's so helpless and needs saving? like FFS. All she needed to do was call the police on a man whom she hated, that abused her children and it'd be a slam dunk case. But instead she'd rather live a life as a martyr/victim and revel in a pain of it all. Woe is her. \n\nOnce my dad had weekend custody the endangerment and abandonment continued. I remember when I was 5 he'd left me alone all day with no food. I was crying hungry and all I could find in the apartment to eat was a box of mac n cheese. I tried to make it by climbing on the counter and pouring cups of water into a pan on high on the stove and ended up pouring boiling water all over myself when I was trying to drain the noodles by dragging the full pot along the counter to the sink. The counter was eye level with me. I was alone for an additional several hours after that, still hungry and now injured.\n\nSo many stories of the dangerous things I'd do for food. Collecting coins from the couch cushions, crossing a 5 lane highway (no crosswalk) trying to get to the store a half mile away. Trying to buy something at the deli only to be refused service until a parent was present. All before I could read. Did my mom ever once call the police on her ex-husband? NOPE. What about when her ex-husbands girlfriend knocked her son (the GC) out cold? Nope. Too much fun living that martyr life, yo. Oh how she screamed and raged, while not doing a SINGLE. FUCKING. THING TO STOP IT.\n\nSo I was just reading in another sub just now about some guy who was supposed to be babysitting a toddler but instead put the toddler in her crib and left for an hour. He only did it once and the police are pursuing child endangerment charges. He's going to prison. Someone who occasionally babysits for them called it in, she wasn't even present, just heard about it. That's amazing to me. Just one phone call, by someone who just HEARD about it! That was all it takes to pull a baby to a safe environment. Full blown CPS investigation. All it took was one person who cared. Just one person, one phone call.\n\nEvery person I crossed paths with didn't care that much. All the motorists who swerved or slowed to avoid hitting a kindergartener on a highway never stopped to dial 911 and report about hey, why is this little girl alone? No neighbors, no extended family, or family friends. No babysitters, teachers. Not a single person. No one I came into contact with gave a shit, let alone my own parents. I remember the comments from people my dad was talking to about how unkempt my hair was, how I was dirty. My dad would make me the joke of it, saying she doesn't brush her hair, she doesn't want to take a bath so I'm letting her sit in it. You have to teach children grooming. You have to care for your child.\n\nI can't get over it. I don't know how to let this go. I'm a full blown adult with very small kids of my own, I can't afford to be upset all day. But I look at them and I can't even imagine it. I can't even imagine not giving my child food and letting my baby sit in squander all day. Ndad never saw a single consequence and I somehow just need to let it go. Please, please tell me how.\n\n",

        "text": "Oh, I have 'friends' all right, but I'm realizing that I actually have no one truly supportive in my life, unless you want to count a coworker or two who care enough, like coworkers do. \n\nI'm actively working through healing now in big ways, which has led to this realization and I refuse to turn back from it despite how much it hurts and how lonely it makes me feel. But I realize that 'friends' I have are extremely fairweather, and obviously think I exist to entertain them. I finally mentioned this to a few of them recently and each one said that unless I'm entertaining them/sharing things they like, then I'm not doing okay. Well, I thought it was not my obligation to do any of these things. Yet, this is what it sounds like - an obligation that I make sure they think I'm totally okay, and an obligation to continue entertaining them so they don't have to feel bad about whatever I'm going through. I was and am SO ANGRY about this. \n\nI rarely even expect them to be around when I'm having a bad time. I rarely mention to them when I AM having one. Because I don't want to 'bother' people with my problems. But when I do, I can't even begin to type about all the ways my frustration, anger, or unhappiness is immediately attempted to be silenced by 'friends.' Instead of somebody just letting me talk about whatever, or just letting me put something out there. \n\nI've just had enough. I've had enough in all realms of my life. It seems like most people expect me to play caretaker for them, but whenever I need even the tiniest emotional support, I'm this huge burden and shouldn't be allowed to have my FEELINGS. I don't know how I attracted so many people to me who are so insecure that my feeling anything but joy/happiness is an enormous threat to them. But at this point it disgusts me. I realized that if I got to move away I'm not even sure I would care to see a single person I know again, save for those few coworkers. \n\n-----\n\nEDIT: The worst, most recent example of this is when I stayed at a homeless shelter last year. I have C-PTSD and it was obvious there multiple times because I would dissociate very badly. I had also mentioned it to a social worker there that I was FORCED to talk to 2x a week, and she minimized it every single time and told me I was fine and doing well, despite that I have a DIAGNOSIS!!! She also expected me to be her special helper and be a volunteer of the shelter while living there (she did not expect this of any other residents) and also expected me to help two of the guys staying there because my calm nature would be good for them (this is what she told me). I don't have a background in social work and was just as down and out as everyone else. \n\nI don't understand these double standards from so many people, and that so many people treat me as less than human and don't have a right to negative feelings just like everybody else. Because I'm also not the type of ACoN who really allows people to walk all over me, I let my anger show when it happens. ",

        "text": "I'm pretty sure I was but since I'm not a psychologist It feels kinda wrong to go round telling people she has this disorder but I'll tell you my story.\n6 months ago I finally broke up with her after 4 and a half years together. It had been a long time coming. when I first met her i had never been in a long term relationship before. I was 25 she was 26. She had 3 kids to 3 different men, was married to another (for 4 months), had someone living with her when I met her who she claimed was just a friend who was protecting her from her previous partner who had beat her up apparently. So thats 6 men in total. Straight away alarm bells were ringing but it was strange as she seemed like the perfect woman. she came across as this very mature adult who has her life, house and kids in order and she made out she'd just been a victim of circumstance and that I was the one she'd been waiting to come along. She was all over me in the beginning saying I was the perfect man and that she wished she'd met me before all the others. \nAfter a couple of months I started getting what I can only describe as \"bad vibes\" from her. One example of this was she had mentioned something about her ex having some tickets to a concert he bought when they were together but it wasn't for another 2 years. Well the concert was coming up and apparently he'd asked her if she still wanted to go since one of the tickets was hers. As she was telling me this I interrupted her and said \"you're not actually considering going are you?\" and she said \"no I was gonna ask him If I could buy his ticked so me and you could go and if he says no I'll tell him to f**k off\" (they were on bad terms over their child). so I said \"oh ok then good\". nothing more got mentioned on the subject for around two weeks then as I was talking about what to do at the weekend, she said \"I'm going out at the weekend remember? \" to which I said where? \"I told you about the concert two weeks ago\". I instantly got angry and said \"YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA GET THE TICKET OFF HIM\" to which she said \"yeah well he wouldnt give me it\" so then I said \"what happened to telling him to f off?\" and she claimed she never said that to me and when I repeated the exact words she said to me two weeks before she went into this rage and began screaming at me and calling me every name under the sun and claiming she doesn't have to answer to \"the likes of me\". I was left stunned as to what had just happened.\nA month or so later we had party for new years eve which we had some of the neighbours round and every one got really drunk especially her. Later that night there was an altercation in the street with said neighbours and police came. My gf was outside getting amongst the drama (she's addicted to drama). I kept trying to tell her to get in the house but she wouldn't so I went to bed. I was awoken about 15 mins later to her hitting me in the head with her phone and when I stood up she pushed me over and did so once more when I stood back up. As I stood up again she punched me in the cheekbone and as I began to get very angry I said \"hit me one more time and I'll hit you back\" to which she said \"what you gonna do big man?\" and punched me in the exact same place again. That was it I just seen a flash of white light next thing I know she's on the floor unconscious. I panicked and tried to pick her up to which point her son walked in the room as she was coming round and she told him to go and get said neighbours and tell them he's beating me up. so he runs out the house hysterical to which I said \"what did you tell him that for?\". Moments later the neighbours come rushing in the door expecting a bloodbath when in fact it was all calm and I was getting ready to leave and go back to my flat. She then says to them \"he was beating me up\". to which one of them said \"you don't look like you've been beat up\". so I told them what had actually happened and my gf said \"If I punched you in the face you'd have a mark on your face\" so I turned to the side to show them my face and one said \"ooh yeah you've got a big bruise on your cheek\". At that point she turned on them and began to abuse the very people she wanted help from because they could clearly see through her bullshit. They then walked out the door and I tried to follow them out but she immediately begged me not to go and the only reason I stayed was because it was 2am and my flat was a long distance away and I didn't really have any means of getting there. So I said to myself we'll sort this out in the morning when she's sober. Morning came and when I tried to say \"are we gonna talk about what happened last night?\" she just kept saying \"I cant deal with that right now\" and it essentially just got sweeped under the rug and forgotten about (or so I thought). \nA week later she said she wasn't feeling well and asked me to get her a pregnancy test which turned out to be positive (two weeks) much to my suprise as she told me she was on the pill. strange as i'd never seen her take these pills. Anyway she was saying things like \"are you not excited? you're gonna be a dad\". naturally I was stunned and was now worried that after seeing her Increasingly aggressive behavior I felt the same thing was happening to me as had happened with her ex's. Fortunately for me there was complications and she had a miscarriage (I know that sounds bad).\nBy this point things had completely changed with her she was no longer all over me, no more compliments, nothing. All the while she's still expecting physical attention from me (backrubs, footrubs etc), to run around for her and her kids and it got to the point where I was doing everything. As more time passed I felt like she was treating me like a servant but still expecting to be treated like a princess. She was showing no physical or emotional interest in me and when I eventually brought how I was feeling up she totally disregarded how I felt and actually made me feel like I was doing something wrong for bringing it up. when I said \"you're not the same toward me as you used to be\" she said \"yeah its called a honeymoon period, it happens in every relationship you wouldn't know as you've never been in one before me\". I immediately felt myself being manipulated and I said \"no this is something different you barely interact with me anymore\", to which she replied \"well what do you expect look at the way you've treated me\" which left me instantly frustrated as I liked to believe I'd been a stellar boyfriend to her and her kids. I said \"what have I done to you that would justify you being so cold with me like you are?\" She then said \"look at new years eve, you punched me while I was pregnant\". I couldn't believe what she was saying. whats worse was she actually looked like she believed what she was saying. \nIt was clear by this point there was something going on with her. I even found myself saying to her \"you need mental help.\"\nThe next four years was just a rollercoaster of rows and breakups  which always consisted of me leaving with the intention of never seeing her again only for her to worm her way back into my life saying all the right things to get me to come back only for the same old shit to keep repeating. most of the time I came back to find in the days I had been gone she'd been talking to other men which sparked another episode. \nOne of these episodes that really stood out was when I'd had enough and said to her \"I put everything into this relationship and you put nothing in. I get nothing and you get everything. You're just not worth it.\" at this point she completely broke down in a way i'd never seen before she was screaming saying \"how could you say that to me?\" and like the soft shit I am I said sorry and tried to console her. But it was clear I'd unintentionally struck some sort of nerve.\nThe next thing was she accused me of not committing to her and her kids by not giving my place up and moving in with her and pressured me into doing so and because I felt like I wasn't ready to give up on her I moved in. (conveniently around the time the government brought laws in forcing people on benefits like her to work and she would have to pay full rent). when I moved in she said if I payed the rent she'd pay for everything else. seemed pretty fair at the time but as time went on it was becoming clear I was getting the raw end of the deal and when I complained she said things like \"you've got a roof over your head haven't you? you get fed don't you?\". like she was doing me a favour by letting me live there. By this point she was rarely cooking anyway it was mostly me and she would rarely buy shopping so I was spending my remaining money while she was saving money from not paying her half of the bills and not much else.\nThis went on for another 2 years till it got to the point where I had genuinely had enough and decided to test what Id been feeling for a long time which was would she still want me if I wasn't doing all this for her. So I gradually stopped making all the meals and told her to make them. stopped going to the shop for her cigarettes and made her go. stopped giving her physical attention like backrubs etc. Lo and behold she started spending a lot of time around her latest set of new friends (they usually don't last long). One of them was a man who she kept mentioning to the point it was like she was deliberately trying to wind me up. When I accused her of spending too much time around him she accused me of being immature which was rich coming from who I thought was a very mature woman when I met her but soon seen she was like a little child in an adults body who makes everyones life a misery when she doesn't get her own way.\nHer excuses to be around this man were getting so pathetic that it got to the point where I thought to myself \"if i don't get out soon i'm gonna do something i regret\". The fact she was treating me like I was stupid and born yesterday and actually expected me to believe her bullshit was infuriating. so the next day i shoved everything I could into my car and left while she was starting her first day at her new job (she was constantly going from job to job because there was always someone wherever she worked that \"had it in for her\").\nI found out a week later that the very same day I left this man appeared on the scene and has been there ever since. Also after years of hearing stories about her ex's and actually witnessing for myself how she twisted tales to paint herself in the better light I like to believe I developed a skill to \"reverse engineer\" her stories to get the true version. \nOnce I left I took it upon myself to contact her exes who suprise suprise all turned out to be really nice guys and each one said the same thing. she was a lazy,lying,violent,manipulative,aggressive,cheater who always had the next man lined up when things ended. this was such a relief to know my gut instinct was right all along.\nI found out so much extra appalling stuff about her some from her own family (who really liked me and were apalled at her behavior) and its got to the point now even 6 months on I still cant believe I spent nearly 5 years of my life with someone who is the polar opposite of everything I stand for (morals, integrity etc).\nShortly after I left I seen a post that read \"narcissists are very good at making you look like the abuser and them the victim\" which is all she ever did in the whole time we were together. with me, her exes, friends she fell out with. everyone. this lead to me \"going down the rabbit hole\" with NPD and after watching hundreds of videos reading so much on the subject i'm pretty confident she has it. \nthanks for taking the time to read i know its a bit of a long one. :)\n \n ",

        "text": "I recently posted this in r/raisedbynarcissists but I thought it was more appropriate for this community. \n\n Basically, I have an Nstepmom who was physically abusive when I was younger and extremely emotionally abusive throughout my teen years and up until recently. We have been able to get along as long as I did everything she asked/wanted. I was able to survive (barely) and please her but when I fell in love and she didn't approve I just couldn't let him go. She put me through hell until I said I wouldn't see him. \n\nSo We've hid our relationship for 3 years and I finally got the courage to stand up to her and tell her I'm an adult that can make my own decisions. My dad (who is sweet but has always been in denial of her abusive) didn't approve because I lied but said I am an adult. She went crazy and had the entire family ignore me (aunts, grandma, cousins, etc) and they pretended like I didn't exist (not an unusual punishment). I could take all of yhis but then she started taking my baby step sister away and told my step brothers not to talk to me which was too much. Long story short I had no where to go but told yhem i respect them but was leaving bc no one deserves such treatment and I'm not going to leave my bf. Nstepmom called me names and said I was a piece of shit like my birth mother, etc. My dad and step siblings begged me to stay and that was hard but I had to. \n\nI had no where to go for the Summer and no money (I am a residential advisor at my forge during the academic year so I get free housing) so I couch surfed for a few weeks. Friends turned out not to be friends like I thought and I ended up living with my bf for the SuMmer. He fed me, took me out on my birthday, paid my cellphone and credit card bills and helped me by loving me and convincing me that my family is not okay (they all tried to make me feel guilty for leaving and said I was selfish). \n\nAnyway, I'm back at school and just got a job and have to take out a loan to continue school. I also am struggling to make my siblings understand that I haven't abandoned them like she's telling them. My dad will barely text back bc he doesn't  understand why I cant  just give her what she wants and come back since his mom was worse and they still are close. I am afraid that she and her sisters will vome looking for me (they know where I am) and hurt me. I am sad that my family doesn't talk anymore and that they don't understand why i cant just take it anymore. But,\n\nMy point is this: It took me 21 years, counseling and an amazing partner and support system. But YOU CAN DO IT. Don't let finances or guilt be an excuse. Take some time to plan if you need but get out. I am struggling everyday but I will take it one day at a time. I am thankful for having a safe space and even though I'm struggling financially, I am not depedent on her. Please know that you can get away. And That you have a right to be loved and safe even if loved ones you care about dont understand. I am trying to remind myself of this everyday as my journey has just begun. ",

        "text": "Without giving too much away, I hit a snag in a social group yesterday. I'm not sure, but I think I may have committed a faux pas in a small group yesterday...so after replaying and replaying and replaying the interaction in my mind all night ofc I woke up anxious and needing to know/apologize/smooth it over/feel better/move forward asap. I wrote the person I may have offended an upbeat email, essentially saying, \"hey it occurred to me I may have not done the right thing, and I wanted to check in with you. Am I right in thinking perhaps I went too far? If so, I really apologize. Please let me know if you want to talk about this or anything else, as I really want to make sure things are good. Let me know, if you like!\" I thought it struck a good tone, that if she's not offended she can easily say \"oh no prob\" and we can drop it without there being a weird groveling air from me, but if she was offended she can easily piggyback on what I said and air her complaint without having to do the heavy lifting of worrying how I'm going to take it.\n\nThis is probably already ten times more than a non-acon would be thinking about it, but I'm not done.\n\nShe hasn't responded. I guess it's possible she hasn't seen it yet or been too busy to respond but...kinda doubt it. We see each other again on Monday with the group, so I'm pretty interested in clearing it up before then! I don't know what the rest of the group think, and I don't want to ask around bc I don't want to create drama, or seem to be drumming up sympathy if indeed people feel like I did something wrong. So I have nothing to go on, and with my stellar acon training I'm...interpreting it the worst way possible. What if she's TOO offended to even respond to my email? What if she drops out of the group over it?? What if she tells everyone an inflated version of the slight, makes me out to be a monster, and then I look even worse by acting as is nothing happened? What if I go around to everyone else trying to gauge the situation and they all decide UGH that steelyeye sure is needy and full of drama-?\n\nI'm not asking for advice. Although, I mean, fire away.\n\nWhat I'm wrestling with is, the way I interpret things, and my approach to handling them. Because my desire is to be forthright, straightforward, face embarrassing things head on and deal with the momentary embarrassment rather than hide and hope no one noticed and fret and possibly be twice as embarrassed when it comes up later AND I skirted the issue. But when my straightforward tactic doesn't work, like this time (so far at least), I don't know how to protect myself and I kind of panic.  As you can see, I've dreamed up several nightmare scenarios based on simply not getting a response, and I've spent so much time worrying about this all day. At this point, I'm mulling over the power dynamics involved and whether I would have been better off to ignore and downplay! Because I feel I've handed my power over to this person, and now she can be kind or she can be cruel and I can't do anything about it because I've already apologized. If I had said nothing, it would have been more work for her to embarrass me, and maybe she wouldn't have bothered...if she did, then I could be like \"oh THAT-? Oh wow I had no idea that came across that way but hey sorry\", thus getting to frame the thing with my reaction.  The way I've done it, I've already admitted it's a big deal, it's just up to her to decide HOW big!\n\nBelieve me, I know this is insane. I wish I was different.\n\nIn short, I'm worrying and I don't know how to stop shop I'm trying to plan...and in planning I'm dissecting the social choices I make and what I should base them on- a philosophical ideal of earnestness, and deal with the consequences even when they're painful? Or on self-preservation, even though it can lead to paranoia and holding myself apart from people? \n\n\nTL;DR: How much do you worry about others' reactions?  Do you assume people you don't know well are going to be mean or vengeful to you, or do you truly assume people are most likely to be kind? When you make a mistake, do you prefer to get it out in the open and admit fault or do you hope no one does anything and it'll all just go away? Does \"feeling safe\" factor into that decision? \n\nThanks fam. Hope everyone's well.",

I've been running into an issue where I can't get good coverage bc I have secondary insurance, even though I never use it. I called the insurance, and they said to call ERS bc they had no power to take me off as a dependent. I called the ERS, and I told them I had no relationship with my parents, I could get a letter from my therapist to prove they were abusive, and have them remove me from my insurance policy, but even under those circumstances they claimed that they could not do that, and only my NMOM could call and make that change. RN my Nmom is on a trip, and I will try to get her to do it when she gets back, but if she refuses I'm not sure what I can do. Has anyone been in this position?",

Or, is there a better subreddit for that?\n\nI left her on Wednesday after she tried to abuse me into falling out of love with her (she admitted this a few hours after I left), and I went digging and found she was planning a totally new life with someone else. She was my fiancée and my business partner and now I've lost those, plus my home and my entire business.\n\nI have no parents and my friends are very supportive, but I am at a loss for what to do to recover or where to go from here, and I am under a tremendous amount of stress to find a job in a city I haven't lived in for 12 years.\n\nThat is all to say, is this the best place for a post about this? I can make a new post that is properly tagged if needed.",

I am uncomfortable around people, especially around women. This is a chicken or egg situation. My career choice, hobbies, and in turn my social life is 97% male dominated.\n\nDid I choose these things because they are male dominated or is my life male dominated because of my chose these things?\n\nAnyway I hate saying it, I am quite sure the fear response, shutting down, going into protect mode all comes from dealing with my N mother and N sister and following the example of my father who tolerated abuse, manipulation, and disrespect from the both of them.\nI feel as though he had no obligation to protect me as a child from N mom and N sister. People tell me otherwise and it feels entitled to think he should have.\n\nI have been reading Brene Brown's books on vulnerability, books on self esteem, no more mr. nice guy and all kinds of other shit looking for the answer.\n\nDriving is a passion for me. When I feel like driving for fun I hit the back roads or the highway and tear shit up. While I am in the car doing this I am present and focused. I think about the police and I am like fuck a speeding ticket. It is the cost of doing business.\n\nHow come in a social situation, I can not go join a group of people. I wont even think about talking to any woman I find attractive.\n\nIn my head people are repelled by me. In my head I do not belong wherever I happen to be. When my boss hands me my paycheck I feel like I do not deserve it.\n\nI know what I want in life, and it is killing me inside when I lock up out of fear and leave a situation having not tried what ever is scaring me at that point. I will then resent myself for not trying and I am getting frustrated wanting the courage and not getting it.",

We were together for a little over two years. \n\nHe would come back crawling. Begging. Claiming things changed and he realizes I'm not a bad person it's just his insecurities lead him to believe I'm evil. \n\nAnyway, after coming back two months ago for about a week and promising the world, he told me he didn't feel the same way about me anymore and took off. \n\nA month later, he decides to tell me he is moving states away to leave behind memories he has of our horrible relationship and start a new life. \n\nI got a random call two days ago from him. Telling me how he sold everything, the job he was promised keeps getting pushed. The people he is staying with are getting annoyed he is there and can't find a room. Now, he can't stop thinking of me and how he messed up by running away and how he created more problems for himself. Me being the doormat that I am,listened and offered some insight and words of encouragement and some tough love. Basically I told him it was time to grow up and stop depending on other people, but he made his decision and have some faith that things will get better. He called again later that night saying he was confused about his feelings and was considering coming \"home\"\n\nNext day, yesterday, sends me an email of how things are going so well there. The people are so nice and welcoming. He has job prospects unlike here in my state. How things are so hopeful and already going so well. \n\nSeriously? He called me to use me for support and then acted like I was the big bad wolf and all his problems in California were due to me and running away was the best thing for him. It just made me feel used once again- what did I expect tho? ",

        "text": "My husband is useless around events like birthdays and mother's day. Where as my family, dysfunctional as they are, at least made a kind of effort. Or rather, my N mum made them all about her. \n\n\nThis weekend my husband went out of his way to get a present for a small child whose birthday is in a fortnight. I got out of the way as I suspected it was a cover for him buying a card and a gift for me too - my birthday's today. \n\n\nLast night my husband casually mentions he hasn't bothered to get me a card or a gift. As you can imagine, I was really hurt and had to explain that as a kid of an N, who never gave me a gift that wasn't loaded with passive aggressive undertones, this sort of shit hurts. A lot. It's exactly the sort of stunt my mother would have pulled just to show how unimportant I was in the grander scheme of things. \n\n\nSo he sheepishly went out and at least got a card for this morning from him and our daughter. \n\n\nI'm estranged from my mother. NC for two years. Her last gift to me was a the book \"Dexter is Dead\", the final book in a series about a serial killer. I think that says all you need to know about our relationship. \n\n\nLow and behold, I get a lovely little gift box in the mail this morning. The packaging says lovely, kind things that my mother would never in a million years say. This is absolutely not a thing she would choose unless she had an audience she wanted to impress and show how kind she is regardless of my cruel indifference to her. \n\n\nObviously, the card says simply 'From Mum', with nothing more. But after a lifetime of crap gifts, it's a pleasant surprise - particularly in contrast to my husband's efforts!\n\n\nWhich leaves me wondering if A. I woke up in an alternate universe yesterday morning? Or B. Is the N trying to butter me up because they want something? \n",

        "text": "Tomorrow is my 2-year anniversary since going NC. While I have blocked my family from email, text, phone, etc. today one made it through because it was sent to my work email. \n\nI only saw the first line before deleting it, but it was from my Nsis and said my dad is dying and doesn't have much time left.\n\nMy dad has been \"dying\" for about 5 years now and I knew that when I went NC. People with his diagnosis usually don't live for more than a few months, and after going NC I realized that many things about his illness didn't match up. \n\nI don't doubt that he was initially sick, but there's lots of evidence to suggest that my parents may not have been honest about his diagnosis or about the severity and extent of his illness.\n\nFor whatever reason I felt compelled to read this email and actually had a mild panic attack when I saw it. That used to be a typical response when seeing anything from my family, but lately I've been able to have no response at all even when seeing a card in the mail, etc. So it feels like a giant step backwards.\n\nI remind myself that I went NC not to hurt them, but to protect myself, and that I knew my dad was sick at the time. I had decided from the start that I would not attend the funeral or break NC, etc.\n\nThere's a part of me that doesn't want to know when he passes - I've been so happy lately and had made so much progress, I want that blissful ignorance to continue. \n\nBut there's another part that wants to know in case there's some relief in knowing that someone who caused me so much pain in my life can never do it again. \n\nI'm feeling tremendous guilt and am really torn, although I also think it's possible he's no more sick than he was 5 years ago and this is only happening because it's the 2-year NC anniversary and they're grasping at straws.\n\nSorry for the rambling, but if you care to share your thoughts I'd really appreciate it. \n",

        "text": "I'm currently in therapy treating major depression and PTSD, my lovely souvenirs from my parents and abusive relationships. Thankfully I'm managing the depression with medication and I've learned to recognize flashbacks for what they are. The problem is that I'm still learning my triggers. \n\nLast night I found one of my biggest triggers and it makes me hate myself a little. If people seem upset, especially if I could be implicated as having ANY role in why they are upset, I shut down. I begin to cry and slip into weird little... Rituals? Mostly just rubbing my hands on something over and over. I guess that's not really the important part. \n\nAnyway, a situation arose last night where my darling fiancé was frustrated and upset and hungry. I felt at fault because the dinner I insisted on making ended up being something he didn't like at all. He cleaned all the dishes and my dinner mess so I could cool off in the AC and eat because I was not feeling well. \n\nWhen he came in to join me, exasperated himself, I shut down. I felt terrible, I should have cleaned my mess, I should have stayed and helped, I should have found an alternative to the ingredient he didn't like, etc. He knew something was off with me, even when I insisted that I was okay. But telling him that my PTSD had been triggered was so difficult. It's not his fault I react like this! His emotions are valid, he is entitled to be frustrated with cleaning up such a mess before he can even think about eating. I don't want him to feel like he can't share his feelings or be honest with me, and I feel that  being triggered by his being frustrated might make him feel like he has to protect me from his feelings. \n\nThe part that makes me feel extra shitty is that he has never once lashed out at me. He's never so much as raised his voice at me, and he sure as hell has never cursed at me. *He* has never given me a reason to expect a blow up. In fact, he's remarkable as far as taking responsibility for his own feelings, communicating with me... \n\nUgh, this is turning into a rambling mess. I know I need to discuss this with my therapist, but does anyone have any advice on how to handle these emotional flashbacks for now?",
