The past principle of lie is “lied”. \n\nThen, which sentence is correct:\n“My father often lay in his bed, watching me and making sure nothing happened to me” or “My father often lied in his bed, watching me….”\n\nThe reason I ask is that somehow I often read “lay” being used in this context, like “As she lay dying” or “Woman attacked as she lay sleeping in the sofa”. However in both of these context it’s the past principle of someone reclining. \n\nThanks.",

That was awkward, with all the police and paperwork. But MAN! Eddie Murphy was worth it. I'll miss John though.\" \n* In the above statement I'm speaking figuratively, describing an imaginary scenario, in which John laughed himself to death. I want the listener to momentarily suspend disbelief and give this figurative description a little room to breath, so they can really understand how funny the show felt. \n* I use two mechanisms for asking the listener to suspend disbelief.  One is that I assert that this literally truly happened.  The second is that I double down on the description of John's demise, explaining that it was a hassle because of paperwork and police, and later saying that despite the great show I miss John. \n* The use of \"Literally\" in this case is grammatically, semantically and logically correct, because I'm am using it to make a (false) assertion that something truly happened.  It's an assertion made for effect, but the term is correctly used within the context of that assertion. \n\nIs my analysis sound?  If not, can you explain why it isn't?\n\nThanks!",

What are the guidelines concerning this? It’s my understanding that you’re supposed to capitalize words like “dad,” “mum,” etc., if they refer to a person.

My thought is that if you refer to someone as “officer” because they’re _an_ officer, you don’t capitalize it, but if you refer to them as “officer” becauase their title begins with “Officer,” you capitalize it, even if you don’t mention their name.

I know “can” is the present and “could” is the past. \nAnd \n2. “can” is used when something can be done and “could” is used when something can possibly be done. \n\nI think the sentence should use one or the other and not both, otherwise it’d be grammatically wrong for both of my thought 1. (can’t use two different tenses in a sentence) and 2. (can be done OR can possibly be done).\n\nLet me know if my understanding of this is correct, if not then why is it grammatically correct to use “can” and “could” in the same sentence?",
