        "text": "I don't have a funny picture for you guys, but I have a story to tell that happened over the last weeks. Not sure if this story fits here, but it sure as hell ain't a tale from tech support nor is it a /r/ProgrammerHumor material. (*Not sure about the last one*)\n\n\nI'm working as a junior software engineer for a company, and due to my success with GUI programming two years ago, all GUI related issues and tasks drops to my basket ever since. I don't complain.\n\nA few months ago our test team moved on to automated tests, which was a very good idea since I never liked to see a bug I caused being assigned to me two months later.\n\n\nAnyways, two months ago, I wrote another program that was mainly consisting of GUI elements, heavy concurrency problems, incompatibilities between components (program was basically a stitching of 6 different components, which 4 and a half of them I wrote before), and having an automated GUI test was excellent.\n\n\nExcept it kept *failing*.\n\n\nI'd go to work in the morning, opening my mail client only to see 17 **build failed** mails.\n\n\nNow, some of these fails were due to me commiting a new fix that breaks a former working feature; and I had a lot of earful about the issue from my manager: However after working on it sometime, I was sure that it worked flawlessly. Nevertheless, tests kept failing and logs weren't much of a help. Worse, my manager was not convinced that I wrote a perfect program; and insisted I checked it. Being the failure I am, suffering impostor syndrome, go take a look at it for a few hours. Try to break the software, nope, it's solid. Go to test lab and run the tests manually, still works. Run the automated tests, grab a cup of coffee, watch the test nearly two and a half hours. And...\n\n\n*Test passes...*\n\n\nI go back to my manager and tell her that tests pass, she is not convinced. \n\nShow here the mail that says \"Build back to normal: SoftwareX\"\n\n\nShe asks if I did something. I say nope, and tell her I watched the automated tests, doing nothing but watching. She comes with me, sits and watches the whole test for 2 and a half hours, and it passes again. She thinks about assigning me the task of finding the root cause, but we have an upcoming release check, and I need to finish other tasks. She instead assigns the task to test engineer. I have a good laugh. Not my problem anymore.\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, an intern joins the test team. Good lad, I occasionally go for a smoke with him. I talk about the issue. He says he is on it with test engineer. He occasionally updates me on the progress. Nothing comes up. Still having many e-mails about the failed builds. It kinda becomes the norm. Even my manager accepts it as it is.\n\n\nYesterday, I went for a smoke. Intern comes running, big grin on his face.\n\n\"*We found the issue!*\"\n\n\nUninterested, I ask \"*What was it?*\" and more importantly \"*Why was it not happening on my watch?*\"\n\n\nHe replies:\n\n\"When the test was running, a windows update pop-up would appear and all clicking and screen comparisons would fail due to faded away and non-clickable background. That background is the software you wrote.\"\n\n\nApparently, IT didn't keep the test workstation up to date and set it so that while anyone is working on it directly, it wouldn't bother to ask for updates. Bastard waits for the time when no one is around.\n\n[Related pic](http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/the-shining-scene-woman-hammer-get-windows-10-your-pc-is-ready-for-your-free-upgrade.jpg)",

        "text": "Btw, this is a sock puppet account to protect the innocent. Code is Java 8 here, not telling what it is in real life.\n\nI'm doing some code review, and I proposed a simple change to a largely unrelated piece of the application (unrelated to the code below, totally relative to the code review). After implementing the change, the coder told me that the change broke the ordering of certain user selected elements in \"a summary portion\". \n\nIt took us _30 minutes_ to pin point the problem to this piece of code. And by pin pointing I mean that I asked probing questions (some of them twice) and finally the coder pasted this piece of code.\n\n    public void setStuff(UiComponent&lt;Item&gt; component, Summary summary) {\n      Set&lt;Item&gt; itemsSet = component.getSelectedValues();\n      if (itemsSet != null &amp;&amp; itemsSet.size() &gt; 0) {\n        List&lt;Item&gt; StuffLst = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        for (Item i : itemsSet) {\n          if (i != null) {\n            StuffLst.add(i);\n          }\n        }\n        if (StuffLst.size() &gt; 0) {\n          summary.setStuffList(StuffLst);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n_Sidenote, especially for readers whose Java is a bit rusty:_ During the half hour I had linked stuff from Java's documentation: most importantly that Collection/Set doesn't guarantee an order when iterating over it (unless the actual implementation does guarantee, eg List/TreeSet).\n\nI pointed out that this pasted piece of code was indeed the the culprit. After 30 minutes of radio silence, I'm presented with unrelated questions. FML, no \"thank you\", no nothing.\n\nBut also I'm not sure how that worked in the first place. By sheer luck?\n\n_Bonus:_ For fun and profit, what's wrong with the code? I mean the obvious is that it just converts a `Set` into a `List` and expects it to be ordered the way the coder expects it to be. I mean, also, since the component never returns null for selected values, am I totally insane if I'd just like to rewrite the method like this:\n\n    public void setStuff(UiComponent&lt;Item&gt; component, Comparator&lt;Item&gt; comparator, Summary summary) {\n      // Option A\n      List&lt;Item&gt; stuffList = component\n        .getSelectedValues()\n        .stream()\n        .filter(Objects::nonNull) // XXX: Are there ever 'null' as selected?\n        .sorted(comparator) // this is the thing that was actually missing from above\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\n      \n      // Option B\n      List&lt;Item&gt; stuffList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(component.getSelectedValues());\n      sutffList.sort(comparator);\n      \n      if(!stuffList.isEmpty()) {\n        summary.setStuffList(StuffLst);\n      }\n    }\n\nThanks for listening, I feel better already.

        "text": "Preface: Below is an excerpt from one of my colleagues daily tasks sheet (mentioned as ‘Journal’, hereafter), which he updates every morning when he comes in to work. A dedicated coder, or a warrior I should say, trying to save a sinking ship from the past one year. I am sure, if you are a developer, this will hit you right in the feels.\n\nBlack Monday 29th August 2016: “The project contract has been terminated”, the client said over a Skype meeting, making angry and really worried impressions one can ever imagine. “The project contract has been terminated!”.\nWe already knew this would happen eventually. By the looks of the project, the dilapidated code base, unethical database structure (which the client neither wants to change nor enhance), legacy code and tech, pathetic communication and unrealistic requirements for new development, this was foretold. We were at war gentlemen. The war between the Matrix and Neo. And the war is over.\nIt was an endless river of unseen, unimaginable bugs that would attack from every corner, of the code base. This is not just a piece of text file with some random notes. The entries in this journal describes each day what we have faced. Each day was a nightmare. code breaks, patch ups, data integrity issues, svn conflicts, cross browser issues, massive spamming of live customer data all had formed alliances against us. We were a no match for them. It was like being tyrion of house lannister, in the battle of black water bay. History wont remember us, and no songs of our glory would be sung.\nWe tried holding the ground for a quite a long time, until this day. We tried everything to save it, but it all went down. Like it was meant to be. we did not save the project, however we were able to save the lives of all the developers which were about come in this god forsaken organization.\nAll the senate members (management) want to hear is how much revenue did the project bring in with the minimum number of resources utilized, and not how much sweat &amp; blood was lost. Did we really let the project go? Or was it the so called smartness of the senate, which thinks they know how to get the job done, and save money. Was it really possible with some technical expertise, correct decisions, and some timely actions this could have been our day? Yes. It was. Well, to all those ignorant, money-making bi**hes, f**k you!\n“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” -Theodore Roosevelt.\nViva la Vida,\nexit();\nend of line.\n\nSo….teary eyes right? I know. Well, let me know your thoughts.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/6auh5v/ive_been_tasked_with_fixing_this_database_code/",
        "text": "I've been working on fixing up some ancient code on this project (from another company) that deals with updating a long-term storage database that archives another application's database. The problem that needs fixing is that the application was creating a single database connection to use across all threads and for as long as the application is running. This crashes every day or so, mandating a manual restart of the application. We need it to pool the connections and work across any number of threads to keep up with the high volume of requests.\n\nThe first major offender I put a short term fix in for about a year ago was that this single connection would be closed whenever a particular web service was used. Since the code had nothing in place to even try to open a new connection, it would work once, then fail on every subsequent request from any endpoint. I wrapped it up in a class that would prevent anything from closing the connection and called it a day, as there were many other issues that needed attending to.\n\nNow that it's time to go and fix it up properly... well, I've found so much stuff in here I know I won't get to it all. I've changed some of the code to remove any identifying information, but the structure is the same. The comments starting with \"ME:\" are mine; the rest are from the wonderful people that came before me.\n\nIn every data access class, there's the following field (not part of any base class):\n\n    private static final Map&lt;String, String[]&gt; fieldTableMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n\nThis mapping between database fields and fields from the other application is populated in the static block of every file:\n\n    static {\n        //ME: This is column, table, sequence. I'm not sure what uses the sequence yet. Sometimes there's more than one.\n        fieldTableMap.put(Field.OPERATING_SYSTEM_NAME, new String[]{\"OPERATING_SYSTEM_PK\", \"database_name.OPERATING_SYSTEM\", \"database_name.OPERATING_SYSTEM_seq\"});\n        //ME: This is repeated for most columns in every table, sometimes on the order of hundreds of lines\n    }\n\nSince there's never any real reason (in this application, anyway) to get data out of the database, most retrieval looks like this:\n\n    @Override\n    public ResultSet get(ChangeEvent event) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n...there's no null check on the other end. If someone calls the wrong web service, they'll get a nice 500 error.\n\nFor the lucky few that have implemented get():\n\n    @Override\n    public ResultSet get(ChangeEvent event) {\n        if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n            logger.debug(\"Get ...: \" + event + \", Parameters: \" + event.getParams());\n        }\n        ResultSet rsFind = null;\n        PreparedStatement pFind = null;\n        try {\n            conn = DatabaseConnectionManager.getConn();\n            pFind = conn.prepareStatement(FIND_ITEM_STATEMENT);\n            pFind.setString(1, event.getItem().getKey());\n            rsFind = pFind.executeQuery();\n        } catch (SQLException se) {\n            if (logger.isErrorEnabled()) {\n                logger.error(\"SqlException: \" + se);\n            }\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                if (rsFind != null) {\n                    rsFind.close();\n                }\n            } catch (SQLException e) {/* DO NOTHING*/\n            }\n            try {\n                if (pFind != null) {\n                    pFind.close();\n                }\n            } catch (SQLException e) {/* DO NOTHING*/\n            }\n            try {\n                if (conn != null) {\n                    DatabaseConnectionManager.close();\n                }\n            } catch (SQLException e) {/* DO NOTHING*/\n            }\n        }\n        return rsFind;\n    }\n\nThis project was built in Java 7 from the start, so they could have used try-with-resources from the start and saved a lot of time and space. Note the static close in DatabaseConnectionManager. :)\n\nWhen it comes time to insert data, there needed to be a way to update older entries that have changed:\n\n            String status = item.getStatus().getName();\n            int statusFk = lookupDao.lookupAndInsert(STATUS, status, conn);\n            int pk = getPk(event.getItem().getKey(), conn); //ME: event.getItem() is the same as the \"item\" above\n            boolean found = false;\n            if (pk != -1) {\n                found = true;\n            }\n            if (found) {\n                if (event.getEventTypeId() == (long) EventType.DELETED) {\n                    delete(eventId, conn);\n                } else if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                    logger.debug(\"update\");\n                }\n                update(eventId, createDateStr, updateDateStr, dueDateStr,\n                        closeDateStr, description, short_description,\n                        organization, assignee, trackingNumber, statusFk, event, conn); //ME: The event is passed around everywhere, despite only needing the 'item' out of it\n            } else if (event.getEventTypeId() != (long) EventType.DELETED) {\n                if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                    logger.debug(\"insert\");\n                }\n                int itemPK = getItemPk(ie, conn);\n                // what to do if -1 is returned? This is why to use exceptions\n                if (itemPK != -1) {\n                    insert(eventId, itemPK, createDateStr, updateDateStr, dueDateStr,\n                            closeDateStr, description, short_description,\n                            organization, assignee, trackingNumber, statusFk, event, conn);\n                } else {\n                    logger.error(\"pk not found...\");\n                }\n            }\n\nEvery lookup of an ID or item in the database returns -1 or -2 instead of throwing any appropriate exceptions or null as needed.\n\nThe real icing on the cake is the database insert code.

Since each one is a little bit different, it's not really possible to automatically update a bunch of the code. Additionally, there's two items that only differ by one field; however, it was decided that all of the code of one should be copied into another class, changing just the table names. One of these hasn't been maintained and the code/configuration has since diverged enough to be another wonderful pain.\n\nSo far I've spent a week deciphering exactly how this all works (there's a lot more that isn't here) and devising an entirely new system that we can maintain going forward. I get started on that Monday!\n\nI'm rather burnt out on this and it's a Friday, so please let me know if something's a little confusing. I shall do my best to elaborate!\n\nTo top it all off, these are just a few of the tables in this database: http://i.imgur.com/UV9i5wv.png",

        "text": "*fade in*\n\nIt's 2016, and I'm at Purdue attending their STEP Summer Engineering Program\n\nOne of the many projects we did was program some arduino boards with speakers on breadboards. The challenge was to make the board play a song. Simple.\n\nMost of the other highschool students had never even touched a compiler, and so they gave them the most barebones crash course on what to do. They basically just told them 3 methods that were imported, \n\n     play(*note*); stop(); wait(*time in ms*);. \n\nWell, to start off, none of my group members had any idea what they were doing. They were lost all week, but especially right now. Luckily, I had taken, count 'em, *one*, programming class, so I did all the work. \n\nI tried to be efficient about it, so I defined all notes as ints whose names were the note and octave (i.e. C6) and values their frequency (The Arduino language had this #DEFINE thing that apparently replaced all instances of the variable when downloaded to the board, I thought that was neat coming from java) . I made a method that used the 3 provided methods in sequence when passed a note, and made the song an array of notes that would be parsed with a loop. ~20 lines in total, excluding declarations. \n\nI was fairly confident that I would win the award for this category at the end of the week, because as far as I could tell, the other groups were struggling.\n\nWell I didn't win.\n\nThe group that did win, won because their program was over 1000 lines long.\n\nTheir source code was\n\n    play(*note*);  \n    wait(*time*);  \n    stop();  \n    wait(*time*);\n\nFor every. single. note. \n\nAnd they bragged about it! As if writing inefficient, exceedingly long, copy-paste code was an achievement!\n\nYou know what category I did get an award in? 3D printing. I had never even seen modeling software until then, and it was difficult for me because I have [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia)\n\nBut I won, because I modeled and printed a nokia flip phone, that didn't flip.\n\nCan someone tell me that this trend of rewarding incompetent work, won't continue when I actually attend Purdue this fall?",

(drumroll)\n\n&gt; continue to optimise and get improvements in sound, one thing I have found is that as the loop is optimal the reliance on low latency is reduced, in fact sounds much worse at low values, so can now use a period of 0.5s \n&gt; \n&gt; found that best vs2010 optimisation settings were for speed. \n&gt; \n&gt; playing wav files from a ramdisk gave best sound\n&gt; \n&gt; then moved on to memory play, initially SQ was worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; found that a function called memcpy was the culprit, most memory players use memcpy and this is one of the reasons why memory play sounds worse ie digital sounding. Fortunately there is an optimised version of memcpy from http://www.agner.org/optimize/, using this version removes the hard edge produced by memcpy. the other thing I did was to close the file after reading into the buffer.\n&gt; \n&gt; also most players use malloc to get memory while new is the c++ method and sounds better.\n&gt; \n&gt; updated exe below, sounds fantastic I use it all the time now, doesn't have the processed sound of JPlay and is the best player I have heard on my system.\n&gt; \n&gt; https://rapidshare.com/#myrs_filemanager/file/3363\n&gt; \n&gt; optimised loop below. \n&gt; \n&gt; `(code elided)`\n\nMany kudos to this person for a *very* good find: https://twitter.com/tumult/status/855082563395768321\n\nScreenshot (including code snippet): http://imgur.com/gallery/v4P1efp\n\n^((NB. I fiddled with the page in the devtools so the code was monospaced in the screenshot. The forum this is from doesn't actually do that.&amp;#41;)\n\nAs I said in the imgur image description (for the three people who will actually read said description),\n\n&gt; Kind of sad. But I don't look at these people with contempt, and it's important to - hearing IS incredibly subjective!!\n\nTL;DR: observe, contemplate, and *[be nice](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12707606)*. :P\n\n-\n\nSo. This forum thread (from 2013) is still alive in its native habitat!!! you get to browse around!! - but...\n\n...the site seems mildly slow (why^y^y am I not surprised), so I've provided both archive links as well as the live versions.\n\nI would suggest starting with the archive links to lessen suspicious-looking ^(and potentially site-killing) surges of traffic to *this specific thread in particular*. ^(¯&amp;#92;_(ツ&amp;#41;_ /¯)\n\n- archive.is link: http://archive.is/XG733\n\n- Web Archive link: http://web.archive.org/web/20170424063110/https://www.audioasylum.com/messages/pcaudio/119979/re-a-revolution-in-audio-rendering\n\n- The live version: https://www.audioasylum.com/messages/pcaudio/119979/\n\n- The entire thread, archived - humongous, visual design falls completely apart (with 30px-wide posts due to mass indentation, etc); this one's primarily to save the data: https://web.archive.org/web/20170428232312/https://www.audioasylum.com/cgi/t.mpl?f=pcaudio&amp;m=119543\n\n- It took a good 15 seconds for the site to load the previous link, so I'm not linking the live version of that, you can strip the archive.org prefix off if you want.\n\nFor those of you who noticed [the Blogspot link](http://mqnplayer.blogspot.com/) at the bottom of the thread (or in the screenshot), I'm genuinely curious as to what your opinions are of the software being made available. I fear it's probably a great deal of mislead but well-meaning snake oil - but that's why I'm asking.\n\nAlso - http://www.agner.org/optimize/ is an assembly-optimized version of memcpy that is actually genuinely good. Considering this gave me pause for a small second after it made me think of something.\n\nSome time ago, when I ran a specific screensaver-type thing ([Xtacy](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/ftp-archives/sunsite.unc.edu/Sep-29-1996/X11/toys/INDEX.short.html)) in a specific mode (swarm, IIRC) on a specific computer (an 800MHz AMD Duron box) with a specific GPU (Matrox G450) *and then held my head at a very specific angle and distance from the system unit*, I could hear ringing in my ears. A friend was able to verify this oddness, and wondered whether the code happened to perfectly hit a resonant clock frequency of part of the hardware. I later heard another reasonable justification: the code was pushing the GPU to its limits and the power MOSFETs were whining.\n  \nAnother slightly more recent anecdote: I've noticed if I have a specific hacky speaker amp turned up too high, the Wi-Fi dongle hanging off of said speakers (so I can keep track of what the status LED is doing) induces interesting-sounding soft bursts of static. I wonder whether using a high-level language would generate noise on the system bus... or (more likely) whether these people worked on embedded or ultra-low-resource hardware at some point and using anything else except assembly introduced jitter and germinated the idea that tinkering with code in this way would affect the sound. It's certainly possible.\n\nI won't discount that these people *may* actually have broken hardware and be actually hearing things. But they're distributing their code to other people, who aren't then calling them out, soooooooo....\n\nNB. I got the idea to add the year onto the post title from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).",
