Booked through FHR with my platinum card for one night (received the $200 hotel statement credit). It was my wedding night which I noted on my booking. I got there at around 1 pm to check in and put my stuff in there so I wouldn\u2019t have to later, when I did I received my FHR welcome letter which included a $125 Credit (they noted that this would cover almost anything that I could charge at the hotel including restaurants, spa, room service, anything else) as well as free breakfast for 2 up to $75. Also side note they put us on the top floor as the room upgrade.\n\nWhen we arrived after our wedding they had gone in after I left and put a bottle of champagne with two glasses as well as a plate of chocolates and some other items for sleep (a mask, slippers, earplugs). We settled in and at around midnight got a bit hungry and wanted to order room service, they had 24 hour room service so we got some cookies and a charcuterie board which totaled around like $30 plus tip. The next morning we ordered breakfast where we just got a whole bunch of stuff because we\u2019d be traveling for the rest of the day! I think the total ended up around $96 plus tip.\n\nWhen we left to checkout the hotel clerk informed me that my credits took care of everything even what I tipped so walked out that morning with nothing to pay! \n\nIt was honestly a way better experience than I anticipated and It made the night just a little more special!",

I have excellent credit (over 750) and am in good financial shape with lots of cash on hand (will be buying a home in SoCal in cash sometime next year). However, I'm an idiot when it comes to maxing benefits on credit cards.\n\nI'm starting to travel more for work and personally and would like to take advantage of points, miles etc. I've been looking at AmEx Platinum but them doing away with 2 free guest lounge passes has soured it a little although I can get around it by making my wife an authorized user for $175. I currently have a AMEX blue cash preferred I use for everything. I primarily travel with Delta and Alaska. I use Uber\/Lyft frequently and my wife and I eat out (take out or restaurants) for most meals.\n\nI will probably use the card as my primary business card or continue to use the BCP business and just the plat for travel spend if that makes more sense.  But I don't want to deal with more than two cards.\n\nAre there better cards at similar price points. Listed what I'm looking for by level of importance.\n\n1. One primary card for business spend. I hate managing multiple cards\/accounts, etc. and don't really have time for it anymore.\n2.

    "text": "I recently needed to book a flight from DEN to BOS and wanted to use points for the trip. The options basically were to transfer and book Delta, transfer and book JetBlue, or redeem at 1\u00a2 per point via AMEX Travel. Delta seemed to be the cheapest option points wise, but I noticed there was a SW flight which, if I could use the Amex Travel route, would be significantly cheaper points wise due to how much lower the cash fare was vs Delta.\n\nThe issue is that Southwest doesn\u2019t let you book flights online by any other means than their website, so they simply aren\u2019t on the Amex Travel portal. I know though that sometimes you can book them over the phone with a travel agent, so I called the number on the back of my card and followed the prompts to get Amex Travel (turned out to be Platinum Travel Services instead of Expedia, a big plus) Turns out not only could I book SW at the same price as on their site, I could pay with points for 1\u00a2 per point over the phone, just like if I booked it on the travel portal. I had to confirm a few times I wanted to use Pay with Points with the agent, but now I see them deducted out of my account and a credit should post soon.\n\nAnyways, thought I\u2019d share my experience since this is a nice little way to get around the SW not being on travel portals thing while using your AMEX points. Yes, I know this isn\u2019t the most valuable way by far to redeem points, but it fits my lifestyle\/desires\/needs. As long as I am getting at least 1\u00a2 per point, I\u2019m pretty happy.",

A cursory Google search has revealed that Amex members cannot PC from the EveryDay to either the Gold\/Plat or the cash-back cards\u2014otherwise, I would (probably) just do that.\n\nFor more background: I make about $60k\/year and my FICO score hovers around 800, currently at 797.

They told me I need to speak to Amex customer service. I then call Amex\u2019s line and they say they can\u2019t enroll me or even see my enrollment status on their side and I need to use the website.

Just yesterday I received an email about my current stay and it had my gold elite benefits listed.

    "text": "Hello everyone, I just wanted to provide a bit of a data point when it comes to returned payments. Recently I have been in the process of moving banks and I set up my new accounts through the app in order to make payments. Generally I like to pay off my cards every two weeks so I went in to make a payment not realizing that the funds were not yet available in my new accounts. I was stupid and didn\u2019t even look at the available balance vs the current balance.\n\nAnyways I made a $250 payment on my BBP card way before the due date. Next morning I realize that I screwed up as I got a returned payment notification. I called Amex right away and explained my situation. I quickly wired additional funds to the new account so they would be there upon the second pull. It went through the second time and I didn\u2019t get charged a NSF fee.\n\nSomehow I made the exact same error for a payment to my Platinum Card and to my Delta Reserve Card. Of course those payments bounced and my cards were disabled. \n\nThis afternoon I called Amex again and had them verify funds with my banks and they released the holds and both payments posted successfully the second time around. \n\nI did get charged fees on both personal cards but not the BBP. It\u2019s my screw up so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even ask to waive those fees.\n\nNow I\u2019m sure I\u2019m on the Naughty List for a little while but I seem to have escaped account closure or FR, knock on wood.

In addition I am using other cards like the freedom flex\/discover it to get 5% at groceries and the custom cash out get 5% at dining. Next quarter it\u2019ll probably be the opposite because the discover it will be 5% at restaurants. Either way, I value 5% much better than 4x points so my gold card doesn\u2018t find its way into my wallet much.\n\nSome background info:\n\nI am about to start my 3rd year with the card.\n\nLast year, when the AF posted, I got a retention offer. I think it was like 20k or 30k points and I accepted it and got the minimum spend.\n\nA little over a month ago I applied for the blue cash preferred and got the intro bonus pop up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am weighing a few options:\n\n1. Get another retention offer and keep it for another year. \n2. Get the amex everyday to hold on to my points and cancel the gold.\n3. Get the schwab platinum to redeem the points for cash back and cancel the gold. \n4. Get the vanilla platinum with the resy offer for 100k and 10x at dining and cancel the gold. \n\nI like amex, I think it\u2019s just not right for me at the moment. I am not using points for travel much at the moment, but I do foresee more travel in a year or two. I am worried with applying for another card to still hold onto the points because I already got the pop up and I may not be eligible for another SUB. Additionally I think I may be at a lower chance of getting a retention offer because I already got one last year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your opinions on what I should do.",

However, on their website, I'm only giving a 25k upgrade offer. I want to keep my Gold alongside the Plat, so I didn't want to go this route. I used to receive Amex Plat 125-150k offers via email but haven't gotten any since August of last year\n\n\nI came to this sub and found a 150k referral link, but after going through the application, it says I'm ineligible for the welcome offer. I was also ineligible for the 80k public offer. Would I have to get rid of my Gold Card to be eligible for the Platinum offers, since all my targeted offers are all upgrades?",

Today, I received an offer for 3,000 MR points for a $3K spend from a single or combined eligible purchase\/s within 90 days of adding the offer (up to 3 times).\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. When it says \"spend a minimum of $3,000+ in one or more qualifying purchases\", does that mean as long as I am able to spend a total of at least $3,000 within 90 days of adding the offer (meaning diff. transactions over a 90 day period), that I would get the bonus MR points?\n2. It seems that these would be on top of the gold card multipliers, correct?  Meaning, that I would still earn the usual 4x points on restaurants and groceries, 3X on airfare, and 1x on everything else?\n3. Also, since I just got the card and am still working on reaching the minimum spend requirement for my SUB (75K MR points after spending $4K in the first 6 months) would my spending for the next few months be simultaneously counted towards earning the SUB and earning this particular offer?  Hope that makes sense.\n\nThanks for any wisdom you can share :)",

(this has been discussed earlier) \n\nThe centurion card went from 1.5 MR earned on every SEK (exchange rate to USD is USD:SEK =~8-10 SEK) spent to 1:1 (same as platinum) and the focus has been moved from points earning to lifestyle events. (also note that MR is not on the same value at all - and have never been) My relationship with AMEX is close and in conversations with the reps, I learned that the Swedish market is moving away from the MR Collections and a focus on the needs of the members.\n\nTo be added we have never had a multiplier deal in my years with Amex. Ways to earn MR is to use the card or invite a never member.\n\nAwards travel is moved to the branded cards with Scandinavian airlines instead. This to focus the reward travel redemption - it has also impacted the availability of SAS business award travel to almost none. \n\nThoughts and claim:\nThe former country manager for Sweden was promoted to head of \u201cemerging markets\u201d. Seeing the post about the Mexican gold card and a comment in the thread that MR is also being slice. Leads me to predict that the MR earning schemes will be a way of the past. \n\nLifestyle Offerings of clubs like the Manhattan and hong kong centurion houses, or the lifestyle scene in Sweden with concerts, dinners, and other events, together with centurion living events worldwide seem to me the new way of the vanilla cards. \n\nAs many of you have said there is inflation in the platinum card, lounges are crowded and the schemes and redemption offers to earn MRs are staggering. \n\nDiscussion:\nHow important are MRs to you? Would you stay on vanilla or move to a branded card? What if multiplying MR rewards was removed - what would you do? \n\nWith US MR being handed out like candy and the USA Creditcard market being what it is do you think the US will change?",

So we have no business revenue for the past year, but we've been paying rent since until construction finishes later this month (Hopefully). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy questions are.. \n\n1. Can I apply for a BBP\/BBC for the cafe using its EIN and have it linked to my Account later on? If yes, Would the points get pooled or would it just be tied to the business only?\n2. Can I use a personal referral for the business as its technically not under my name? \n3. There is no phone number set up yet for the business, can I put a personal number or it has to be attached directly with the business\n4. Theres no option for LLC, so which category would it fall under?\n\nI already have a BBP as a SP and just looking to set one up individually for the cafe but unsure if the process is more difficult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any insight!",

    "url": "https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/amex\/comments\/11fjymt\/beware_amex_online_portal_a_cautionary_tale\/",
    "text": "All,\n\nSince one of the benefits that folks cite, including myself, for choosing Amex is the fact that it functions in part as a large scale travel agency that leans toward the luxury traveller.\n\nI am a Platinum and Gold holder as well as a holder of the Marriott product.\n\nI'm getting married in a month and we have our honeymoon scheduled for September\/October and we are flying to Entebbe, Uganda from LAX.  The route to get to Entebbe from the US can be pretty circuitous so we leaned toward fewer stops.  This left us with Emirates or Qatar airways as the only carriers we could do that with.\n\nLucky for me I've wanted to fly QSuites for a while and now was an excuse.  I paid full fare for two tickets - that I booked in November - through the international business class program on Amex (resulted in about \\~$1,000 less in face value of the tickets plus I didn't have to pay to choose my seats).\n\nA week or so ago Qatar Airways decided to stop flying the DOH-EBB leg for only one day of the week - our planned day.  They tried to rebook us for a day later but our safari is pretty tight on timing and any changes would incur costs. I called Amex to figure this out and we quickly rebooked a new ticket which did a DOH-NBO-EBB.  One more stop but I could live with it.\n\nUpon looking at the ticket with my safari coordinator we realized that the NBO layover was 1-hour, late at night in Nairobi and we would have to change terminals.  Our folks in Kenya laughed and said this wasn't possible.  I figured I could call up Platinum and they would change it for me. It had been less than 24-hours for the change.\n\n**Here's where the real debacle starts**.  I called and first it didn't take me directly to Platinum travel and I had to be transferred.  Then I spent about :30 on the phone with a very nice guy who realized I had booked online and he couldn't help me so he transferred me.  Then I spent 1:30 on the phone with a lady who basically told me I was out of luck and that I couldn't change the ticket.  How could this be?  She transferred me to a supervisor.  I spent 2:40 on the phone with this guy, mainly listening to music, as he read multiple policies to try and figure out what was wrong.\n\n4:40 minutes on the phone.  He basically continued to tell me that I couldn't change the ticket - even if I wanted to pay a change fee or the difference in fares.  Repeatedly he asked me, after I told him no, if our dates were flexible.  Never once did he offer a creative solution or an idea as to why this was happening.  I asked if he could call Qatar Airways to figure this out as I'm sure we could change the ticket.  I asked him to just book from LAX-NBO and then I'd book the other leg myself, told me he couldn't do it. Basically I was being held hostage in this booking for $1,000 or more as you'll see below.\n\nFinally, I said just cancel the ticket and I'll rebook with the proper flights.  He told me he'd check on cancellation fees.  Mind you these tickets were \\~$11,000.  He came back and told me that it would be an extra \\~$1,000 to cancel and then \"refund\" the money.  I said no way.  After that he kept trying other things (I think) and repeatedly asked me if I wanted to cancel after I had told him no.  A new ticket would be an additional $1,700 so all because of this it would be an extra $2,700.\n\nHe then offered me a $250 voucher.  I laughed.  I said we can resolve this if you give me a voucher for the cancellation fee and the $250.  He said he couldn't authorize that and it would be 2-4 weeks - after 4:40 on the phone!\n\nI did what was prudent and called Qatar Airways who told me we should be able to switch it and they should call them etc. which they wouldn't do.\n\nWithout any real recourse I emailed some executives.  Only then did I receive a call with a very profound apology and a pledge to make this right.\n\nSomeone from the executive office called me on Monday, said they would email me, and would connect with Qatar Airways at some point and get back to me on Friday.  I never got the email, we'll see if I get the call.\n\n**The beware here in that it seems, with booking through Amex, that you have to raise hell in order to get good customer service.  I'm a lawyer so I get the idea of reading through rules and the mutual obligations that bind each party in this transaction, however, when something like this is so clearly wrong there should be some mechanism or effort on the part of the supervisor to push this forward as the resolution lies with reason rather than Byzantine rules and regulations.  Rules and regulations can be overridden by people if there is a meeting of the minds where reason prevails.**\n\nJust a caution to anyone in this situation, you likely won't get anywhere with the representative over the phone.  It's likely you'll have to resort to the tried and true method of executive emails as that's the only thing that seemed to make a difference here.\n\nAmex should be doing better with how important this service is to high value customers like myself and likely everyone on this subreddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT UPDATE:**  Finally resolved.  No charges and 30,000 Amex points for my trouble.  They were astounded at the stupidity of the representative that I spoke with.  Said this could have been easily solved.  I guess all that for 30,000 extra points isn't that bad.",

    "text": "So I had re-joined Amex after a brief while away in December. I managed to open up 6 cards between business and personal and began running about $50K a month through my personal Platinum card.\n\nLooking back, yeah, it probably set off some flags right off of the bat, but upon approval of the first card in December, they had already requested a 4506-C for approval.\n\nThis weekend after booking some $XX,XXX first class airline tickets, I got a message that my card was declined after a charge for the first ticket went through for \"A higher than usual balance\". Mind you I pay my cards off in full nearly every week. So I called to see what happened since there was $0 balance owed and after some income and occupation questions was told that I was under financial review.\n\nThey wanted 2 paystubs and 2 months of bank statements from the accounts the cards were paid from. Sent it in on Saturday.\n\nAll cards were frozen until today when I called back in and a nice rep answered who checked in with the \"documentation\" team and that everything looked good and there would be no changes. All cards were unfrozen. \n\nIt seems I have $100K+ in charging ability exposure at this point with them, so I'm assuming that means they're OK with the continued $50K spend. I don't want to have to deal with another F\/R again, so I'm not sure if it's worth pulling back and putting spend on other issuers that don't do this, as I've heard of some people being F\/R'd multiple times a year, every year, or never again. And the outcome ranges from no change, to limit slashes, to outright closure.\n\nJust happy I passed.",

Was able to order $16 takeout fully covered by the credit.\n\nI believe the Uber credit is split monthly instead of in one lump sum so you spend more\/less than exactly $15 each month - either underutilizing the credit or paying more out of pocket to Uber. Ordering the last day of the month where the credits are overlapping prevents this.",

I chatted online and called Amex representatives and they said that \"the system\" declined my request for forgiving it. I am confused because it is my first mistake and I have had my Amex for close to two years. After asking if there is anybody who I can speak to that may have override they said they have forwarded the request to the \"back-end\" and in 7-10 business days I can call back to see if I was approved.\n\nI assumed because of Amex's great customer service reputation this wouldn't be an issue to resolve. I asked why it was denied and they said they have no details and that it is up to the system. When I explained that I didn't feel like the time I spent using their service was being valued they just said I understand. I was not rude to the representatives and told them multiple times I was not upset with them, just confused about the policy. Honestly their service was great despite the unfortunate news.\n\nI am curious, is this standard practice? Maybe I'm misunderstanding but I always thought there may be some leniency with the first mistake, especially since I only missed it by a day and paid as soon as I realized. \n\nSome words of advice would also be appreciated because I am pretty young and honestly devastated that such a small mistake may hurt my credit for years to come.\n\nIdk if its pertinent but I am using the Cash Magnet card.",

If Schwab still had the 2% cashback card, I would go for that.

I realized this morning that the funds are not available in that new account until 03\/02. I\u2019m worried about having a returned payment on that account. I called Amex and they ensured me that they won\u2019t actually pull the funds until Thursday, but I\u2019m still worried that it will get returned unpaid as the funds aren\u2019t yet available. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

Long story short we typically spend $100-125k a year on the platinum. Travel yes but plenty of restaurants and groceries. I\u2019ve never played the points game so putting $50k on the BCP for 2x seemed like a no brained. \n\nOut of curiosity after looking into BCP I also considered the gold against last two years of spend. On average we\u2019ve spent $16,000 annually in the dining\/grocery category - which would be 46k more points on the gold. Now we are down this year with a new kid on eating out but groceries have gone up and still on track to spend $11k-$12k annually in the 4x category. For an extra 32k points. \n\nWhat do people value the points at? I know it\u2019s 1 cent typically but if I could actually stack up on the Uber credit (can you use both plat + gold?) and\/or we do use wine quite a bit so easy enough to use on wine.com. \n\nI don\u2019t care about the fees just wondering if the points hit a point to offset.

Planning to get the Platinum for a 150k signup bonus in a few months. I'll have around 300k MR points from SUB's + purchases. Sounds great right? I'm not so sure, here's where I would really appreciate some guidance on where to go from here.\n\nI've done my own research, although I'm sure I'm still nowhere near as knowledgeable as some of you. As I've seen so far using an Awards vs Cash calculator, almost all flights are not worth using MR points. You literally get a better deal just using cash even when you value 1 to 1 redemption value. The only flights I've seen, and I've checked nearly every single partner, alliance, is the business class flights. I'm in the Boston area. You will see flights overseas for $7,000 round trip,  vs like 300,000 points and $200 cash. Seems nice, but I don't really feel like that's a good use of points for my situation. \n\nI don't mind riding in economy, I just want to get the maximum amount of flights possible. I do not care about comfort, I want to go to a bunch of places. What can I do with 300k points? Do I just wait for when there's a bonus? There was a 25-30% bonus for Amex MR points last September for example. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

I called Amex to verify what was going on (I had two Amex cards on my online account for 9 years) and after some confusion they said that the new card had a different social security number attached to it and was on my account for some reason. They gave me another number to call which just just had an automated voice confirm that my account was \"in good standing\" and hung up.\n\nShortly thereafter, this individual whose brand new card was attached to my account, was able to immediately change emails (probably by getting in touch with customer service) and had both my cards cancelled before I could get back in touch to try and separate the accounts. What the flying fuck.\n\nI found this out as I had just gotten off the phone with their fraud department after getting hung up on twice. They stated this never happened before and that they made a request for me to get a new card. I don't even think that's happening. They said I could not regain access to my old account anymore, and I have no formal documentation of the conversation aside from recording it and a complaint reference number.\n\nThe other individual has my first name and last name and a different middle name. I believe he mistakenly used my email in the application, and between that and me probably not having inputted my middle name when I started the account 9 years ago, it was enough to mess up the system and combine his card with my account.\n\nIs there any legal recourse to this? Was a crime committed when this guy cancelled my cards and took over my account instead of trying to fix it as I was? I just hate getting tens of thousands of dollars and 9 year averages to my credit getting dropped in an instant. This is just unacceptable and I don't even know if anything can be done but just get shafted for nothing.",

The front desk agent mentioned that US new card rules don't apply in Mexico.\n\nThe server showed us our dining table. Full extensive a la carte menu (pic attached) complimentary. If you zoom in, you can see that prices only apply to Aeromexico platinum card, business platinum and corporate platinum. NO buffet, you could order whatever you wanted from the menu. Top quality ingredients and presentation. In the pic you can see the tuna tartare.\n\nFree wines by the glass. Really interesting choices. $30-$40 US retail price bottles. No cheap stuff.\n\nBefore leaving, the server gave me the check and as you can see everything we ordered is at $0.\n\nI decided to write this post because I read inaccurate info around the internet:\n\n1. Apparently the new centurion guest policy only applies in USA. Or at least not in Mexico.\n2. Only few choices available on the menu and you need to pay for almost everything. Not true.

    "text": "Hoping to see if anyone else has successfully made a claim for lost luggage through the Amex Plat.  I arrived back in my home airport on Feb 1st to find my luggage somehow didn't make it.  After 24 hours, it seems my carrier put it on the next flight out, but it had to connect through a different airport.  Because I'm a worst case scenario kind of guy, I asked when is it deemed lost, and per the airline's policy, it is deemed lost after 21 days.  Well after 21 days,  I called, and  I kind of got the run around, but instead of declaring my luggage lost, they upped the escalated the efforts into finding my luggage(really couldn't have done this earlier?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo curious if anyone has been in a similar situation and was able to file a claim with Amex(hopefully they were reasonable).  Just trying to get my ducks in a row because I'm assuming the airline did lose my luggage, and as soon as they actually declare it lost, I'm going to file my claim with Amex.  Any help is much appreciated!\n\nEDIT:  I forgot, assuming my luggage is declared lost, the airline will pay me out, so will Amex Pay me more on top of that?  I honestly had a decent amount of valuable things on there, and to be without my clothes for close to a month is a frickin headache.  I've been trying to live a minimalist life, and I don't like it lol.",

Do they claw back points if they don't believe your audit?\n\nI also have a business checking account with them, and I wonder if I should be pulling my funds out of there, if they could possibly take them if I don't pass their financial review? \n\nAs I stated, 750 credit score, flawless payment history, just recently spent a lot of $ as a small spender for the last few years. I really don't want to lose access to my amex accounts as they are by far the best CC company I've used. I know nothing about this stuff, maybe overreacting, not sure if this audit is a normal thing or there's more to it they're not telling me. Maybe it's because I did a credit card bonus and a checking account bonus for my business all in a one month span? I don't see why that would not be allowed.",

Any ideas? Tips? Should he just wait until maybe the 1 year mark with the Platinum to try for the Gold again?",

    "text": "I know that there is an Amex Optima card, which you can get invited to if you default on an Amex card. Some people said that Amex Optima cards were discontinued a long time ago, but there are forum posts on the internet from as recent as 2021, where people still got invited to get an Optima card. I also saw pictures of an Amex Optima Platinum card floating around on the internet as well. So I had some question about it, simply out of curiosity. Optima cards are considered rare, as not everyone has them, and it is hard to get up-to-date information about them. Yet they are not very desirable, as it means that you defaulted on a previous card.\n\nDo you only get Optima Platinum if you default on a charge card like the: platinum, gold, or green cards; and you'd get a regular Optima if you default on a non-charge card like BCE?\n\nDo you need to pay a yearly \"fee\" for Optima platinum, the same as when you pay a yearly fee for the regular platinum?\n\nIf you default on any Amex card, is there a choice between Optima Platinum or regular Optima, or is this decided for you?\n\nAre there more benefits to Optima Platinum as opposed to a regular Optima card?\n\nDoes everyone who defaults on an Amex card get a choice to get an Optima card; or is this something for people who have a long history\/spend a lot with Amex cards?\n\nHas anyone ever had either a regular Optima card or an Optima Platinum? Would be interesting to hear your experiences.\n\n[Picture](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/American-Express-Optima-Credit-Card.gif)",

Chase Freedom Flex\n7. AMEX Blue Business Plus\n8. AMEX Gold\n9. AMEX Platinum\n10. Chase Freedom Flex\n11. Costco Visa Card\n\nI have all these cards. I mainly shop at Costco for groceries and gas. At costco, I use my Costco Card which makes sense. For restaurants, I am stuck between keeping my AMEX Gold card (4x points) $250 AF or using the Costco Card (3% cash back) but no AF.\n\nI fly back home once a month which is around a $200-$250 flight so I use the AMEX Plat for that but the costco card has 3x cash back on eligible travel.\n\nI don't see the negative of the costco card. It literally covers what everybody needs in this world and the membership can be get paid for itself via the cash back making this card free with amazing multipliers. Everybody needs to eat so groceries covered by Costco and for restaurants 3% cash back. 4% on gas. 3% on flights. Plus I have the executive membership which adds 2% more to each. Visa is taken almost anywhere. I mean, I don't think I need any other card.\n\nI have given some thought to this and thought about the AMEX Trifecta + Costco Card but are the annual fees worth it if the Costco Card covers all areas? What are your guy's thoughts?\n\nSome ideas:\n\nIdea #1: One card setup\n\n1. Costco Anywhere Visa\n\nIdea #2: AMEX Trifecta + Costco\n\n1. AMEX Platinum - flights only\n2. AMEX Gold - Restaurants and groceries other than costco\n3. AMEX BBP - 2x on everything else\n4. Costco Anywhere Visa - Gas + Costco groceries\n\nIdea #3: AMEX Trifecta + Costco + Amazon\n\n1. AMEX Platinum - flights only\n2. AMEX Gold - Restaurants and groceries other than costco\n3. AMEX BBP - 2x on everything else\n4. Costco Anywhere Visa - Gas + Costco groceries\n5. Amazon Prime Card - Amazon\n\nThing is, is it good to use one card on everything or multiple cards? I eat out like once a week only. I do use the benefits that AMEX provides such as the uber credits, dining credit, saks credit, walmart+, digital streaming credit, incidental fees, and hotel credit. I use these all.\n\nAlso, I am a IT Consultant that makes $150K a year so I can afford these AFs.",

I tried multiple browsers, VPN, incognito, referrals, and Hilton App. I probably did 5-7 attempts daily from Wed to Fri without success. Then, on Saturday night I tried again using my regular browser on the Amex website and got a message that my application was under review, but no pop up showed this time. Early Sunday I got an email saying that my application was approved. I received the card on Tuesday and called customer support and confirmed that I was eligible for the bonus. Aside from trying about 20-25 times in 4 days (took a minute each time, so no big deal) I used my amex card five times, but total amount was less than $100. \n\nAdditional context: I've been a member since 2018. Opened Delta Gold and Cash Magnet in 2018, then downgraded my Delta Gold a year later. I don't use these cards, but the cash magnet has a recurrent charge of $4.40 per month.

    "text": "Does anybody have any DPs on how much spend is required on a Platinum card in Italy to be invited to a Centurion card? I have cards in both the US and Italy, but due to the FTF on the Italian Platinum card, I've been primarily using the US Morgan Stanley Platinum with the waived FTF.\n\nI'm on track for about $600k in spend this year on the US card, but the Italian card is trailing at about \u20ac30K. I've seen some random DPs about being invited at \u20ac50\/100K spend, but I want to make sure it's actually worthwhile if I'm going to shift some of my spend. Still hoping to get an invite on the US side at some point.\n\nAlso, does anybody also know if a 4506C is still required for acceptance as well on the US side, or can I skate by on spend alone? They asked for one on approval for the US MS Plat card so they already have my tax info on file for the moment. Income isn't exactly much these days ($50K or so) as I made most of my money years ago and its sitting in brokerage accounts. I'm a dual citizen US\/IT for what it's worth.\n\nI've been a \"cardmember\" since 2008, but just rejoined using Amex late last year, so I don't know how they factor that into consideration either.",
