        "text": "Cons: \n\nThe action doesn't pick up until 70% of the way through. This isn't unusual for Victorian era books, but none of the characters are interesting enough (or interesting consistently enough) to carry the story for that long. \n\nThis is one of the earliest examples of detective fiction, and you can really tell. It's before people figured out how to write mysteries that are actually fun to read. Like Poe's earlier detective fiction, it reads at times like math word problem where every hole is plugged and everything done and dusted once the story is over. \n\nThe \"love interest\" (Laura Fairlie) is so weak, literally and figuratively. The character isn't actively hateful, but dear god, the author's lack of interest in her really shows. She is despised by her husband, treated like disposable trash by her husband's friend, and is so utterly forgettable nobody can even remember what she looks like. She is a nonentity in every sense of the word, and also the paragon of Victorian womanhood and virtue.\n\nThe MC (Walter Hartwright) is so lame. It doesn't surprise me he was the only one in the book to find Laura irresistible. His endless ramblings over his love for her is cringe.  \n\nPros: \n\nCollins liked spicy women and it shows. Mrs. Catherick is fantastic. The book really became less dead when she came on the scene. Wish he had given her more words. \n\nThe last 30% is fast paced and highly readable. \n\nSir Percival Glyde was unexpectedly sympathetic, and \"the secret\" is not bad so far as that sort of thing goes. I actually figured he was some kind of impostor, but he's actually a victim too. The inheritance should have gone to him, but due to unfair laws of the time towards children born out of wedlock, he would have been legally disinherited.\n\nIn general, I like how the villains in the book are actually legitimate victims too. Laura's aunt the countess fosco too was deprived of her inheritance by her own brother (Laura's father) because he didn't approve of her marriage, which is not a crime but certainly a sin on Laura's father part.\n\nAll of which ties in with Collins' very progressive notions of social justice which I enjoy a lot in his books. He's never preachy like Dickens when it comes to social criticism.\n\nConclusion:\n\nModern critics are hostile to the book and for once I'm with the critics. While the last 30% is good, it's not quite good enough to justify the slog that was the first 70%.",

        "text": "There is a moment when they are talkingabout what he might be, like a psychopath or sociopath or what exactly. Graham says that the psychologists said that he is a sociopath mainly because they did not know where else to put him. Then he said that Lecter meets some of the criterias for a sociopath, that does not have any remorse, no guilt and also that he was sadictic towards animals when he was a child, which confused me.\n\nI read the books not the order they were published but how (I hope atleast) would go chronologically. So I started with Hannibal rising, where was Hannibal as a child but there was not a single moment where he would be sadistic towards any animal, if anything the animals were actually the ones he was quite compassionate to. When Hannibal killed Paul Momund (the butcher) he set the fish Paul caught earlier free and took only the one Paul already killed. Same with the birds in Kolnas's restaurant, he did not have to open the cage and set them free but he did, I think he actually took one of the ones that did not want to fly away and made sure he will not stay in the cage. And he was nothing but kind and friendly towards their Horse (Cesar I think?). \n\nSo I was just confused while I was reading the part about Hannibal being mean to animals I guess. Or not sure if I didn't, like miss something?",

        "text": "In recent years, countless books, articles, and documentaries have addressed the negative effects that social media platforms have wrought on their users and society. However, these former works are incomplete — nearly no attention has been paid to Reddit, one of the most popular websites in the world. Reddit is certainly unique among social platforms, but its potential for addiction and darker side of nefarious activity should absolutely not be understated.\n\nAdditionally, nearly no actionable advice has been provided to users of these platforms. The audience is told that these websites and apps are harming their mental health, wasting their time, and that they are addictive (which would logically make the task of quitting rather difficult), but then provided zero guidance on how to disconnect from them. Over 200,000 users gather on Reddit's /r/NoSurf community to discuss reducing their internet use; the forum is filled with reports of people who want to quit Reddit, but find themselves psychologically compelled to return to the site over and over. For moderate to heavy users of these platforms, quitting is clearly not so simple.\n\nYou Should Quit Reddit is a paradigm shift in the genre. Jacob Desforges was a Reddit user of over a decade, and a self-admitted Reddit addict who spent on average around three hours daily on the site. Not only is this the first book investigating Reddit's flaws as a platform, but it is also written from the perspective of someone who experienced firsthand the struggle that comes with quitting these addictive platforms",

        "text": "**Warning: this will be ranty.**\n\nSo... like the title implies. I'd recently finished Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin and I was left feeling like it was 'okay' maybe 'pretty good' but definitely not in love with it like almost everyone else hyping this book to the moon and back. \n\nThe thing is, I feel like I really *should* have loved this book, and friends specifically reccommended this book to me under the assumption I really would and it makes sense they would because:  \na) I'm an avid gamer, gaming since childhood similarly to our MC's Sam and Sadie + I was also a 'sick kid' growing up like Sam who used gaming as a way to escape/cope with my illness.   \nb) I also relate to the half-asian experience like Sam, being half-asian myself.   \nc) I'm learning/dabbling into a couple of programming languages (python 3 and C++) mostly for fun right now, though I do plan to pursue a comp-sci degree in the near future.  \nd) I'm a digital artist, I make pixel art too; a shared life goal/ambition I have with my boyfriend is to create a game of our own together one day (he is an 3D artist and animator by trade).\n\nMy apologies for the autobiographical account that nobody cares about, but now knowing the above you'd understand why I was particularly excited going into this book that everyone seemed to be hyping up as the best novel they've read all year and TBF for the first half of the book I could totally see why. The prose was very readable and engaging; I really empathised with young Sam and Sadie and was compelled to learn of the reasons behind their falling out and how they'd reunite again to work on games together. However, as the story progressed...\n\n**(Spoilery territory)**\n\n...many of the characters just became so unlikeable to me (except Dov, that cringelord was never likable to begin with) and narrative-wise I felt the plot just kind of kept sinking deeper and deeper into the melodrama of Sam and Sadie's constant bickering and miscommunication. Their back and forth dialogue was exhausting to read at times... \n\nWhich brings me to the biggest buzz-kill of my enjoyment of this story: Sadie Green. While some characters I believe were written by the author with the intention not to be liked-- I think Sadie was meant to at least be a semi-likable protagonist but she certainly wasn't in my experience. Which made things all the more confusing to me as literally almost all the other characters in this book seemed to be completely anamoured by her?? I don't think Sadie is a Mary Sue by any means (that title belongs to Marx LOL jk unless?), she's a decently well-written, introspective character and I did empathise with many of her struggles but the way she interacted with certain characters (espcially Sam LBR) borderline frustated me with her constant petulant, dismissive and self-centred remarks and retorts. \n\nI was also not convinced as to why Marx was deeply in love with her, I'm even less certain as to why Dov was either? Or why neither Sam nor Marx had much of an issue with the fact that Sadie was *knowingly* Dov's mistress off and on for ages. Dov was trash and Marx makes it known his dislike of him on multiple occassions, but why was Sadie completely blameless-- especially knowing Dov was never actually going to divorce his wife for her. The king's share of blame should rightfully be on Dov, but I thought it was a little strange how Sadie didn't even cop a tiny (perhaps even unwarranted) fraction of crap from anyone else about it? Unless I missed some things (which I totally might have btw, as I did not have a physical copy of the book-- I listened to the audiobook) and I apologise if I'm severely misremembering, but it almost felt like since Sadie was navigating through her self-perceived flop era for most of the book she was almost immune from all other sources of criticism from the other characters minus Sam. That just sort of felt not entirely believable to me as the reader/listener.\n\nThe last couple chapters + ending was also a little disappointing NGL, the main climax of the story IMO was the shooting and death of Marx, which was genuinely quite heartbreaking even though I sort of saw it coming (Marx had *many* death flags) but the segments in his POV as well as the descriptions of what he was perceiving around him in his induced comatose state was surreally, metaphorically and beautifully written. A lot of the book is written in a similar way which I did really enjoy, but honestly after more of the melodrama arising from Marx's death... I feel as though the rest of the story calmly ~~fizzled~~  faded into the ending. The end felt almost too neatly tied with a bow, almost rushed despite there being a 5(?) year time jump. Sam's grandfather dies and Sadie finally feels some sort of meaningful remorse for the way she ended things with Sam, she attends the funeral, she inherits the DK arcade machine (in which we get a *glimpse* of seeing her excited about something since the first third of the book), semi-awkwardly reconnects with Sam who of course is completely welcoming of her and rapt to be with her again, they have a rather OK conversion which is a recap of events in a lukewarm sort of way, they decide to work together on a game again and then it just... ends. \n\nI did not hate or even dislike Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow. I think I'd give it a solid 3.5/5 were I to rate it right now. I'm just kind of left scratching my head a little as to why this book was SO hyped the way it was (not that I believe it's undeserving of its hype mind you), but I've only seen rave reviews and I feel weird/almost guilty for not being as in love with the story as almost everyone else seems to be-- especially so considering I feel as though I should've been the prime target audience for a story and setting like this. I guess that's what happens when you enter with higher expectations than you otherwise might've due to all the booktuber and booktok fanfare. \n\n**\\[That said, I'd also like to clarify that if you loved this book-- that's literally awesome, and I'm really glad if you did! It was never my intention to shit on this book or the characters (I don't even hate Sadie, I do hate Dov though... sorry xD) or shit on anyone for either liking the book or having a differing opinion to me. I still mostly enjoyed it and I don't regret reading it at all, I just kind of needed to vent some of the gripes I had with it in hopes of some friendly discourse surrounding the characters and events of this book :)\\]** \n\nAnyway, have a nice rest of the day, everyone!",

Even if I am interested in the book, I need time to come back down. So now I have a pile of unfinished novels that I keep bumping in favor of series. I want to read the novels, I just can't make myself make the time. An then I get sad I finish series so quickly! I think reading both at the same time may help me out. It would also help me space out some of the series that aren't complete yet - I won't zoom through them and be waiting for the next one. \n\nI was thinking of reading the series books at home, so I can jump right in to the next book, I don't feel interrupted during the read, and I can really get lost in it. I was thinking I would read the novels during my breaks at work, while I travel, or listen on my commute/on the treadmill. If I'm really dragged in to a novel I could finish it at home.\n\nDo you read multiple books at once? Does it take away from either?",

Most characters, maybe all outside of Alyosha, immediately turn it up to 11 with exclamations, severe passion, extreme drama and what seem like constant changes in mood/intent partway through their paragraph of dialogue. Are all characters constantly on the edge of meltdown/ecstasy or am I reading the tone wrong? Is it the translation? Is it commentary on how the seculars are driven mad? Or is it just the style of narrative? Fyodorovich, Mitya, Lize, Mrs Khokhalkova, Grushenka and especially Illyusha’s father (among others) seem completely unhinged most of the time. Some of them make sense for certain situations. The only relaxed and rational characters seem to be Zosima and Alyosha\n\nI speak Russian, translating bits of it in my head doesn’t really make it make much sense either.

        "text": "Hi there! First post I’ve ever made on this site after years of creeping on threads\nMy mother is a great woman who suffered a horrible childhood. I don’t want to go too into details but it involved: sexual abuse from a step father, her mother denying that anything was going on, having to move in the middle of the night because her step father owed people lots of money, and much more. Due to all this chaos and dysfunction, my mother holds a lot of shame and trauma (though she will never admit it). She’s very much from the generation of “I’m fine, nothings wrong with me, I’m strong and don’t need help”. \n\nI’ve watched her struggle with her body image, eating disorders and a heavy, heavy dependence on alcohol to cope. She calls herself stupid, ugly, unworthy and it breaks my heart that she sees herself that way, and I know it all goes back to her childhood and never actually dealing with what happened. I’ve tried getting her to talk to a therapist, but she says she’s too old to see one and doesn’t need to (she turns 60 this year). If I can’t get her to go talk to someone, I know she would at least read a book if I gave it to her. \n\nDoes anyone have a good suggestion for any books on processing childhood trauma that isn’t too complex to read? Because of my mothers childhood she basically stopped school after middle school, so anything too complex wont resonate with her and I want it to be something that she can really comprehend since I may only get one shot to get her to read something about trauma\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've already read the first three books, and I'm just taking a small break before reading the fourth. It's a lot of fun with great characters and a suspenseful storyline, *but* there's something off about it. . . I've been reading these books and yeah, they're lots of fun, but there is something not quite right about them that I can't put my finger on.\n\nIt seems like the scenes aren't that descriptive. Or rather, it feels like some scenes should have a lot more description than they end up having. Like, the author brings up this one thing and you're like 'Oh, that is important, it's probably going to go for at least a page or so.' but then it just turns into a paragraph or something.\n\nIf anyone else has read this series and would like to put in their own two cents, please, feel free.

        "text": "Today I’ll be reviewing the 2019 book *Ghost Bird* by Lisa Fuller.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: In the interest of full disclosure, the author of this book and I are both part of the same writer's guild, although I've only 'met' her once in a Zoom session last year which is where I first learned about her book and decided to read it.\n\nThe author, Lisa Fuller, is an Aboriginal Australian woman. More specifically, she's a Wuilli Wuilli woman and is also descended from the Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka peoples. She's won a whole heap of awards, too. If you'd like to know more, her website is [www.lisafuller.com.au](http://www.lisafuller.com.au/) .\n\n*Ghost Bird* is the debut novel of Lisa Fuller. The book is a young adult horror/mystery novel set in a small Australian town that backs onto bushland during the 1990s. It deals with the realities of being an Aboriginal person in the modern era in a land that has been colonised. It also explores themes of racism and sexism, and how a scientifically minded person navigates their traditional culture’s mythologies and beliefs in a modern-day environment.\n\nThe protagonist is Stacey Thompson, a young Aboriginal woman commencing her final year of high school. She lives with her twin sister Laney and their mother. Stacey is the responsible, studious daughter while Laney is the wild, rebellious one. On the first day of her final year of high school, Stacey covers for her irascible sister who sneaks out up to no good with her boyfriend while their mother is working a night shift.\n\nStacey has a bad feeling about it but puts it out of her mind. She has a bad dream about her sister being captured by someone or something. The next morning it's revealed Laney never returned from her evening adventure. Was Stacey's dream something more? While the extended family mobilises to try to find her missing sister, Stacey has to go through the motions at school while worrying about her sister's welfare, navigating family obligations and expectations, and the local community politics of a small town.\n\nOverall, I thought the whole book worked well. I found myself dreading the school scenes, not because they were bad or poorly written, but because they hit a bit too close to home for me. Not that I have experience going to school as an Aboriginal person, or as a girl, or in a small town, but I found the routine bullying, politics and lack of even-handed punishments and treatments by the teachers and staff rang a little too true to me. So, job well done by the author! Also, the lack of air conditioning in stinking hot classrooms (the only exception being the computer room) brings back memories, too.\n\nThis book is listed as a horror, but I wouldn't say it's horrific in the gory sense of a slasher movie, but it has the most effectively creepy atmosphere. Seriously, I dare you to read this and not feel creeped out. The mystery is well done because I didn't know exactly what was happening until it was all revealed. And the ending was well earned but kept me guessing right up until the very final chapter. Was her sister being held by people? By *something else*? Was she ever going to see her again? Would she survive her captivity?\n\nI thought Fuller's exploration of the extended Aboriginal family unit, and the obligations and responsibilities each person within feels, was very well expressed. The frustrations of knowing what the cultural expectations are and being torn between following them and doing what you personally think is the right thing. That tension was well explored. Also, the inter-family politics and inherent conflict between the descendants of the colonisers and those whose ancestors have been here for tens of thousands of years.\n\nAnd, while I don't have a personal or spiritual connection to Country (I'm not Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander), there are moments in this book where Fuller has written so effectively what such a connection feels like that it's the first time I've really had the sense of what it might feel like.\n\nI also think Stacey is a better person than I am because there's a harsh decision she makes in the book that haunts her but which I feel is completely justified and mightn’t personally feel guilt over. You'll know when you get to it.\n\nMy favourite character, though, was Rhiannon, Stacey's older and wilder cousin who I feel steals the show anytime she's on-page. She’s just so fun and carefree and reckless and hilarious. She’s great.\n\nAs an example of how effective the atmosphere is, the opening chapter begins with the two young girls learning knowledge of their people from their grandmother. Here is an excerpt from the end of the opening night-time scene at a campfire that really helps set the tone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Turning to ask Laney, I have a second to register the glint of gold and a strange pendant around her neck before clawed, furred hands wrap around her throat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We both gasp at it pulls her backwards out of the firelight.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Laney!'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I spin to Nan, expecting her to move, but she's still looking into the flames.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Nan!'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She finally turns to look at me with shining red pupils. Stumbling, I feel hands grab hold of my shoulders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Be ready, granddaughter,' she whispers as I'm ripped back, screaming into the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I recommend this book? Ab-so-lutely. In fact, on Reddit alone I've recommended the book at least 38 times. Well, once I’ve posted this review everywhere, it’ll be closer to 50 times.\n\nI recommend this book to anyone looking for any combination of the following elements:\n\n* A horror book\n* A creepy book\n* A mystery book\n* A standalone book (not part of a series)\n* Books involving indigenous mythological/religious elements\n* Book by an indigenous/first nations/black/Aboriginal author (I realise these aren't always synonymous, but they are in this case)\n* Book written by a woman\n* Book written by an Australian\n* Book set in Australia\n* Book set in a small town location\n* Book set in the 1990s\n* Book for a YA audience\n* Book that would be appropriate for an English / literature class\n\nAlso, the book has a custom dinkus! It’s a feather of the titular bird. What's not to love about that? (Big fan of customised dinkuses) ^(If you don’t know what a dinkus is, it’s a symbol marking a scene break within a chapter, often indicating by \\* or \\*\\*\\*.)\n\nIn summary, this book was an effective mystery and a creepy horror. It felt very genuine, and I strongly recommend it.",

        "text": "Spoiler warning. This text contains spoilers.\n\nAlright, I just finished Robinson Crusoe and I am honestly mind blown that it was written in the year 1712. \n\nRobinson Crusoe is that kind of book that has lots of people who like it but also many who don't. Could say, controversional. I have to say, for a book that is over 300 years old, it has a very good and clear writing style. Also, the story is very interesting. I couldn't put the book down when the wild savages came in! \n\nSo about the book itself: The start of the book where Robinson Crusoe was traveling around the world was not that interesting, but most books are not interesting in the start any way, am I right? When he got to the island the story started to get some where. I enjoyed the ups and the downs he got, I enjoyed reading about how he survived on the island. But oh boy, when Robinson saw the human foot prints for the first time, let me just say, that part threw me on a wild ride! After that part the book did not get a rest! The ending was also nice, maybe a little bit of a cliff hanger, it got me thinking if Robinson ever got to see his parents, or how he managed to live in the city after living for so long on a island. Any way, these are just some of my thoughts. What do you think about the story? I am down for some discussing about it!\n\nWhat I really like about this is that it is unique. I have never read book like this one. What is really impressing is that the whole story was just about Robinson living in a island, but it still managed to keep itself super interesting.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you like the book or not? Do you think it deserves to be disliked so much? What about the story? What did you like about it? Best parts?\n\n(I apologize for my english, it is not my first lanaguage🙂)",

I'm trying to pin down the precise meaning of that statement, which is rather open-ended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen determining Germany's eligibility, should the Book Thief be included? Although his parents were born in Germany and Austria, the author of this novel lives in Australia. The novel is set in Germany and tells the story of average Germans during World War II.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould Congo accept the Poisonwood Bible as valid Scripture? It's written by an American about their family's adventures in the Congo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould anyone here attest to having done something analogous? Please describe your experience and the rules you subsequently established for yourself.",
