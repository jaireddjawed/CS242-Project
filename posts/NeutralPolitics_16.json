(That page is a general case page, the order granting motion for summary judgment is the court order.)",

        "text": "The CLOUD (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data) Act is an act [proposed by Senators Hatch, Graham, Coons and Whitehouse](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data) on [February 6th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act)\n\nThe bill itself can be found online [here](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s2383/BILLS-115s2383is.pdf), and is not that long of a read. The gist of the bill is that it is amending the Stored Communications Act to fix problems that the proponents claim are in American internet-related laws. \n\n[Andrew Woods and Peter Swire writing at Lawfare Blog](https://lawfareblog.com/cloud-act-welcome-legislative-fix-cross-border-data-problems) support the legislation, saying things like \n\n&gt;Moreover, a number of safeguards are built into the bill. The bill creates a mechanism whereby providers can apply for a motion to quash or modify legal process if the provider reasonably believes the subscriber is not a U.S. person and that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government. It also requires a court to conduct a comity analysis in the event of such a motion to quash, which may alleviate foreign government concerns about sovereign interests. It is not clear why this comity provision is in the statute except as a symbolic gesture; courts were already free under the common law to conduct a comity analysis in thinking through whether to issue an order with extraterritorial impact. Its presence in the statute is perhaps a reminder that trust and mutual respect play an important role in these cross-border matters. \n\nThe EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation - [opposes the bill](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), stating its issues with the law: \n\n&gt;The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act expands American and foreign law enforcement’s ability to target and access people’s data across international borders in two ways. First, the bill creates an explicit provision for U.S. law enforcement (from a local police department to federal agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to access “the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information” about a person regardless of where they live or where that information is located on the globe. In other words, U.S. police could compel a service provider—like Google, Facebook, or Snapchat—to hand over a user’s content and metadata, even if it is stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country’s privacy laws.\n\n• What does the bill actually do?\n\n• Is the bill an invasion of privacy or is it just clarifying outdated legislation?\n\n• What are the implications on currently active cases?\n\n• Is there similar legislation in US states or other countries?",

M5S got 32.22%, PD got 18.9%, Lega Nord got 17.69%, FI got 13.94%, meaning that the center-right group got around 31.7%. The center-right faction and center-left factions got slightly more than their totals currently because they are allied with groups of smaller parties. Overall, the results [showed](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/italian-election-2018-results-map-who-won-Italy-election-latest-1256263.jpg) ([source article](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/927272/italian-election-2018-results-map-who-won-Italy-election-latest)) the center-right faction as the largest faction with 37.00%, 5SM with 32.31%. \n\nThis is a historic win of the anti-establishment over the establishment, and has many implications for Italy. \n\n• What was the cause of the shift towards the populist Five Star Movement?\n\n• How much of an effect did party positions on immigration and the European Union have on the results?\n\n• What statements have been made about possible coalitions by the relevant parties?\n\n__**Background**__  \nThe election took place under a complex combination of FPTP, MMP and PR - First Past The Post, Mixed-Member Proportional and Proportional Representation, after being set in place by the [2016 Italian Constitutional Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_constitutional_referendum,_2016). [This article written before the election](http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/italy-election-2018-what-you-need-to-know-2018-2) goes over the electoral system, the emergence of the Five Star Movement and predictions.\n\n\nMain coalitions:\n\nThe center-left coalition is primarily made up of the Democratic Party (PD), but also includes More Europe (+E), Together (I), Popular Civic List (CP), SVP-PATT, and Aosta Valley (VdA)\n\nThe center-right coalition is primarily made up of League/Lega Nord (L), Forza Italia (FI), but also includes the Brothers of Italy (FdI), and Us with Italy (NcI). \n\nThe main parties in the election were:  \n\n• [Democratic Party (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(Italy\\)): A center-left party devoted to social democracy and social liberalism. The party is a result of the merger of numerous center-left parties, and has been in power since 2013.   \n\n• [League (L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord): League, or Lega Nord, is a regional right-wing political party advocating populism, federalism and is a strong opponent of globalization, immigration and a soft Euroskeptic party.   \n\n• [Forza Italia (FI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Italia_\\(2013\\)): Forza Italia, or Forward Italy, is a center-right coalition based upon Christian democracy and liberal conservatism.   \n\n• [Five Star Movement (5SM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement): Five Star Movement is an anti-establishment party coalition with various principles and many factions: environmentalism, anti-globalization, Euroskepticism, populism, direct democracy are some of its core ideals. There has been ambiguity around the party's position on immigration, Grillo (the party's founder) [advocating](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/12/23/grillo-calls-for-mass-deportations-2_c2583737-0f97-4157-a2f3-d2a9137728b6.html) for the expulsion of all illegal immigrants from Italy, but there is no official position. \n\nThe polling had shown a decline in the center-left coalition share of the vote and an increase of the 5SM share of the vote, with the center-right share of the vote remaining fairly static.

AFSCME is an upcoming SCOTUS case with big potential repercussions on unions.](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/janus-v-american-federation-state-county-municipal-employees-council-31/)\n\n[It is a case about whether public union fair-share agreements violate the First Amendment.] (https://www.npr.org/2018/02/26/588776287/supreme-court-decision-could-further-undermine-shrinking-union-movement) The 1946 Taft-Hartley Act allows union security agreements under state law. Mark Janus argues that the government allows unions to charge employees for fair-share fees without their consent, which violates free speech rights. AFSCME argues that state law allows union security agreements in order to curtail free riding since unions have a legal duty to advocate for all employees.\n\nWhat are the best arguments for both sides? What factors make public unions different from private unions with regard to the law and how they are permitted to operate? Why are/are not union dues considered speech? How has SCOTUS ruled in past cases relating to unions? What factors are different about Janus than precedents that might influence the decision?",
