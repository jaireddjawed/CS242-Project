        "text": "My place of work is a tech start-up and Xander, its original founder, was very different from his successor. During Xander’s time at the company’s helm, the employees were constantly pulling all-nighters in order to meet all of his rigorous demands, which kept multiplying in line with the company’s rapid growth. Nothing less than 24/7 dedication to getting the company ahead at all costs was tolerated.\n\nBut all of this changed when Xander had to take an unexpected medical leave, traveling to some pricy and secluded clinic in Europe for treatment. He sent us a message informing us that while he’ll be cut off from the world, his brother Paul will lead the start-up in his place for the foreseeable future. \n\nPaul showed up on the scheduled day. It was the same morning as a helicopter was found burned to the ground a mile from our office. In hindsight, this was a bad omen, though of course we lacked the foresight to predict this at the time. \n\nPaul looked nothing like Xander and acted nothing like him either. After spending his entire first day peppering us with questions about the start-up (at the time, the profit margins were solidly in the black, with a small but ridiculously powerful group of venture capitalists promising to help take the company to the next level), he asked us about how happy we were at work.\n\nThe main complaints were lack of sleep and no life outside of work. Paul turned out to be attentive to our concerns. A little too attentive in fact. The very next day was when he started his overhaul. Under his management, no one was allowed to come in earlier than noon, and everyone had to be out by five. Alcohol consumption was also encouraged, with each cubicle stocked with a wide assortment of booze and going for drinks after work practically mandated. Whoever was brave enough to voice their concerns got canned quickly afterwards.\n\nBesides the reduced hours and his seeming obsession with getting the whole office chronically hungover, Paul then took it a step further when he would interrupt our no-longer-marathon coding sessions by playing earsplittingly loud rock music, making it impossible to focus. \n\nBut most disturbing was his penchant for posting pictures of employees with their faces grotesquely distorted. Paul brushed off all our complaints about them, claiming he was offended over our inability to take his pranks. That’s what he called the disturbing images. Pranks. \n\nI should have quit right there. Certainly, several of my colleagues did just that. But Paul was wily, suddenly tripling the salaries of the rest of us just so we wouldn’t follow their lead. For the money, we became used to tolerating his eccentric behavior. Though we only understood the whole magnitude of our mistake later on.\n\nIn the space of a month, the once dark and drab office where work had been king, was turned into something of a party house. But Paul was still not satisfied. After installing pinball machines and video games on every corner, he announced that from now on, he would set set aside two days of work a week for “game days.” \n\nA fledgling start-up, no matter how promising, could never be successful under the kind of conditions that Paul instituted. Gradually, even some of my well-paid colleagues began to rebel. The surplus we had under Xander suddenly became a deficit, as clients started to leave us in droves after losing their patience over our sudden inability to meet their deadlines. Soon, the venture capitalists followed, with their deep pockets disappearing just when we needed them most.\n\nPaul defended himself. The reduced hours were so we could “make the best of our skills without missing out on our personal lives.” The booze-loving culture both during and after work was a way to “get us closer together as a team.” The game days were “a way to unlock our imaginations.” The disturbing “pranks” were so we could “loosen up” and bring “our best selves to work.” \n\nFinally, one of our team members could take it no more. Serena, one of the head engineers, had waited until most of us left for the day before angrily confronting Paul in his office, accusing him of trying to destroy the company and demanding to speak to Xander ASAP. Their conversation lasted for almost an hour and ended in a screaming match.\n\nThe next morning, Serena’s photo on the wall was mysteriously replaced with a photo of her drowning, wearing the exact same outfit she had on at work the day before. It was one of my other co-workers, Emerson, her former boyfriend, who noticed the disturbing photo first. At first we assumed it was another one of Paul’s weird pranks. But as the clock kept ticking and Serena didn’t show, Emerson dialed her roommate on his cell as we crowded around him. \n\nThat’s how we first learned that Serena’s body had been found floating in the lake in the early hours of the morning. Her roommate confirmed that she had not seen Serena since before she had left for work the previous day, and had only learned about Serena’s unexpected demise from the cops who had paid her a visit two hours earlier.\n\nWe sat there completely numb from shock, as Paul joined us minutes later. To make it worse, it was one of our two designated “game days” and Paul insisted we go through with it as planned. There was no mention of Serena and when we asked him about her, Paul banned any discussion about her. This time, Emerson, who had remained in the office during Serena’s outburst the day before, could take it no more. \n\n“It was you!” He grabbed Paul by the collar, his face all red. It was the first time I had ever seen him lose his composure like that. “You did this to her! Admit it!”\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Paul said quietly. “Get a grip on yourself.” \n\n“The hell I will!” Emerson said. “You killed her—just like you killed the damn company!” After kicking one of the pinball machines, he was about to leave, when Paul insisted he have a drink first to “calm down.” When Emerson refused, Paul had two other employees hold him down, during which time Paul insisted we all have several rounds of vodka, with Emerson being forced to drink at least twice as much as the rest of us. \n\nThen we were made to proceed with “game day” in our inebriated state, finishing the day with our standard visit to the local bar. That was the last time any of us ever saw Emerson. He was still upright on his feet, though a little worse for wear. \n\nThe next morning Emerson’s photo on the wall was mysteriously replaced with an image of him passed out on the floor. I had a bad feeling about this. Sure enough, his crying mother called the office later that day and inquired about receiving his remaining belongings, informing us that Emerson had succumbed to alcohol poisoning the night before after ingesting tainted alcohol. \n\nThis was the last straw. After two deaths in a row, the rest of us began quitting in earnest, even after Paul proposed yet another raise. This time, no one believed him. The company coffers, once so flush with cash during Xander’s tenure, were now beyond empty. But even scarier was the prospect of ending up like Serena or Emerson. \n\nAfter the exodus ended, the company filed for bankruptcy. Then came the lawsuits from the company’s former investors, naming Paul as the co-defendant. \n\nThis was when we finally learned that Paul was not really Paul. Xander made the discovery himself after finally returning from Europe and learning about the destruction of his company in his absence. He had only been gone for three months, but that had been enough for his jealous best friend Gene, a former classmate whose own attempts at entrepreneurship had failed, to successfully ruin his company.\n\nIt had been Gene all along, impersonating the real Paul who had perished in the malfunctioning helicopter that Gene had loaned him. The helicopter had been registered under Gene’s name, and it was he who had been the presumed casualty of the helicopter’s fiery demise.\n\nThat at last explained why his new office policies led to our productivity nosediving. It had been his real goal all along. \n\nIt’s now too late for Xander to fix what Gene had done. He wants us to act as witnesses for his own lawsuit against Gene, who the authorities are still looking for, but I’m too scared to have anything further to do with it. \n\nThose of us who have no family nearby, have been taking turns staying with each other to make sure that no one is ever alone. We also switched the locks on our front doors, changed our phone numbers, and have been avoiding strangers, or anyone who might be associated with Paul in any way.\n\nBut the last couple of mornings, I’ve been waking up to the sound of loud rock music. I still can’t tell where it’s coming from or how it found me, but I recognize the melody. It’s the same tune that Gene played every time he interrupted our coding sessions.",

        "text": "  It happened around 15:00. The day was cloudy, yet bright. I have no idea what i just witnessed.\n\n  My neighbor the other side of the street lives in a rundown house. Not a very old creepy place, would look quite good if taken better care of, but as it stands it has some cracks on the walls, paint peeling off here and there, and lots of overgrowth around it. The neighbor keeps to himself, never heard much noise from there. All is always quiet at my neighbor's home. Yesterday, however, there was a racket. Around 23:00 or so, i heard pans being thrown, glass breaking, screaming. Afterwards, silence.\n\n  Today, a car hastily pulled up in front of my neighbor's house. A man ran out of the car, screaming my neighbor's name in a worried tone, a baseball bat in hand. The man started hitting the walls of the residence, yelling for him to come out. \n\n  “Get out of there, man! I’m right outside, just fucking run!”\n\n  He tapped on the windows, knocked on the door, turned around to the street, yelled some more, asking for \"help\". The street is pretty empty at this time, very few cars passing by, nobody went out to check. I just watched from my window.\n\n  I heard the man scream again, scared. A woman's face suddenly plopped at the window, abnormally large, pale skin, black hair. The man started hitting the bat against the sidewalk, telling the woman to come out, threatening her. He hit the door of the house a few times with the bat, the woman opened it. A long, skinny, spider like appendage awkwardly beckoned the man in, shyly poking out of the doorway.\n\n  \"Knock closer\", i heard the thing whisper, in a somewhat soothing, ethereal, voice.\n\n  The man screamed for it to stay away. He pleaded for someone to come out and help him. I saw him run down the street, away from the house. Some cars passed by, but paid very little notice to the man. The thing peaked its head outside, it being almost too big to pass through the door. Now, save for some kids playing in the distance, nobody was outside besides the man. Before i could make sense of what was happening, the thing had moved, way too fast to follow. I only saw a silhouette, big, swiftly crawling down the street. The man, almost a block down at this point, got taken. Dead silence.\n\n  The thing, as fast as it went out, got back inside. The door closed, gently. I could only sit there, trying to process what had just happened. \n\n  Eventually, heavier traffic and pedestrian movement started, commuters getting back from work. Few more people came and went to check on my neighbor’s house, knocked on the door, tapped on the windows. The door always opened, the thing always beckoned. They all left, though. All terrified, however.\n\n  The woman had just been peeking outside the doorway. 23:00, the street is empty. All is quiet at my neighbor's house.",

        "text": "This all happened a few weeks ago. I managed to make it back to this dimension alive, but only by the skin of my teeth.  \n\nI really need to find a new line of work.\n\nI didn’t want to be a delivery man.  Nobody chooses this life for themselves.  Nobody grows up with the dream planted in their mind that they want to be the world’s fastest pizza guy one day.  \n\nDriving around in a beat-up jalopy with the smell of pepperoni in your nose.  \n\nYou know what sucks the most about it?  You know that smell of delicious, fresh-baked pizza that makes your mouth water when you get a pie delivered?  When you’re a delivery guy, you just get to sit in that smell all day, and then you don’t get to eat the pizza.  You just get to smell it and let your mouth fill with saliva, thinking about how you wish you made more money so you could afford to buy an extra large with all the toppings, garlic bread crust, and a side of hot-wings with blue cheese dipping sauce for good measure.\n\nThat’s where I was at mentally as I sat in my shitty car, my battery slowly dying as I listened to the radio and enjoyed the last little bit of light afforded by the headlamps.  \n\n“Tow truck’s gonna be here soon,” I kept telling myself, smelling the pizza in the back seat.  “Any minute, the tow truck is gonna be here.”\n\nI rolled down the window and stuck my head out, craning my neck to see into the distance behind me.  The smell of the fresh, autumn night air filled my nostrils and replaced the cheese and hot baked dough and tomato sauce.  \n\nAt first I thought there was a pair of headlights, but then whatever it was blinked out of existence and disappeared, like the glowing eyes of some great cat.  \n\nI rolled up the window quickly, shivering from the cold draft as it filled the car.  \n\nThe address was supposed to be right here.  I had actually been idling while I checked the directions on my phone.  The GPS confirmed that I was where I was supposed to be.  But there was no driveway - just untouched forest surrounding the road as far as the eye could see.  \n\nSomehow I had run out of gas, despite my tank being half-full.  When I checked the time it was as if I had been daydreaming for hours - like I had been in a trance while looking for the address on my phone.  The sun had gone down at some point and it was well past eleven at night, the moon overhead glowing an eerie pumpkin orange.  \n\nThat was when I had called the tow truck.  But it seemed as if they weren’t coming.  \n\nConfused and bewildered, I got out of the car and looked around, wondering if they had gotten lost.  \n\nI pulled my phone out and hit the redial button for the towing company.  But this time all I got was static, as if whoever had picked up the phone was in a different dimension - separated from me by a wall of entropy.  \n\nThe brush on the other side of the road suddenly began to rustle and sway, as if something were moving behind it, trying to stay hidden but too large to manage that successfully.  \n\n“Hello?” I called out, hearing the quiver in my own voice and wishing I sounded braver.  Wishing I were braver.  “Who’s there?”\n\nAnother sound came from behind me, and I spun around to get back in the car, terrified of whatever was stalking me so far out in the middle of this night-black forest.  \n\nBut the car door slammed shut as I bumped into it with my wide hips.  Too many hours of sitting and not enough sit-ups.  Too many undeliverable pizzas eaten in parking lots for half-price.  Too many years of not taking care of myself, taunted me as I grabbed the door handle and tried to pull it open, but found it locked.  The keys still inside, jammed into the ignition slot, mocking me.  \n\nThe rustling sound came again, and this time it was from behind another tree, and another.  Movements were heard on all sides as my eyes darted back and forth from place to place, seeing huge, hulking shadows hiding behind the trees all around.  \n\n“Who’s there?” I nearly shrieked, my voice high and breaking.  “Stay back!  I’ve got a gun!”\n\nI didn’t have anything of the sort, but it was the only thing which came to mind that could potentially ward off threats of such size and terrifying proportions.  \n\nA shadow began to emerge from behind one of the trees.  And another came from behind me.  I heard their huge, lumbering footsteps coming closer, as their features became discernible in the waning light of the moon.  \n\nTheir faces were obscured by the shadows of tree limbs and broken boughs above us, the half-bare branches shedding leaves like dead tissue, falling all around.  \n\nThe warmth of one creature’s hot breath was in my face as I stood, petrified - nowhere to run.  My back was pressed up against the cold steel of the car, the window glass squeaking against my skin as I trembled with fear.  \n\nSharp, long, hooked and pointed teeth grated together as grey lips pulled back into a grin.  A mouth as wide as a windshield opened up as if to devour me, its pointed tongue salivating and dripping.  \n\nAnd then it surprised me by speaking - its voice a rumbling baritone, deep enough to shake my teeth in their sockets.  \n\n“Are you from Dominoes?” it asked, spraying me with fine droplets of spittle.  The acid-burn of them sizzled on my cheeks.  “I ordered eight large pizzas to this address.”\n\nMy hand was shaking badly as I hooked a thumb towards the backseat.  \n\n“In…  Th-th-th-th-there…” I managed to stutter.  “L-l-l-l-locked…  By m-m-m-m-mistake”\n\nThere was a heavy, deep-sounding sigh, as the creature was clearly annoyed by my amateur actions.  But instead of eating me as an alternative, he smashed the window with his claw and reached inside, removing the boxes.  \n\n“Hmmm, a bit cold…” the thing said, sounding irritated.  “You look to be warm-blooded, though.  Your blood might make for an interesting marinara.”\n\nA screeching roar came from the woods, and the creature huffed, and let out a sigh.  \n\n“Yes, mother.  I suppose we should leave him alive.  Otherwise who will deliver way out here?”  \n\nHe began to stalk back into the darkness of the forest, leaving me behind in my soiled and warm-wet pants.  \n\n“It is so hard to find good help these days.  You really must bring back that thirty minute guarantee.  We used to get so much free pizza in this dimension…”\n\n“WHAT DIMENSION!?” I called after the thing, looking around with confusion at the forest of trees whose branches now whipped and coiled like angry snakes.  \n\nHow the hell was I gonna get home?\n\nI looked down and saw a fifty dollar bill was laying at my feet, with the head of a monster in place of President Grant.  \n\nShit.  Not again.  \n\nAt least these guys tipped better than the last [place.](https://youtu.be/rHcK2TpBeG4)\n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/zpi8zt/master_story_list_updated_regularly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n.",

        "text": "The air was thick with the smell of salt water and the sound of crashing waves filled the air. Rachel stood on the shore, staring out at the endless expanse of the ocean. She had always loved the beach, but today it felt different. There was a sense of foreboding that hung over the place like a dark cloud.\n\nRachel couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to happen. She had been having strange dreams lately, dreams that felt more like memories. They were always the same, featuring a shadowy figure that seemed to be chasing her through an endless maze of hallways.\n\nShe tried to brush it off as just her subconscious, but the dreams were becoming more and more vivid. Rachel decided to take a walk along the shore to clear her head.\n\nAs she walked, the clouds overhead began to darken and the wind picked up. Rachel pulled her jacket tighter around her, shivering as a cold gust of air blew through her. She turned to head back to her car when she saw him.\n\nThe shadowy figure from her dreams was standing a few feet away, watching her with piercing eyes. Rachel froze, her heart pounding in her chest. She tried to run, but her feet seemed rooted to the ground.\n\nThe figure began to speak, his voice deep and menacing. \"You can't run from me, Rachel. I'm always with you, even in your dreams.\"\n\nRachel woke up with a start, her heart racing. She was relieved to find that it was just a dream, but the memory of the figure lingered. She couldn't shake the feeling that he was still with her, even when she was awake.\n\nOver the next few days, Rachel found herself struggling to sleep. Every time she closed her eyes, the figure was there, haunting her dreams. She began to wonder if there was something more to these dreams, if they were somehow connected to her reality.\n\nShe confided in her friend, Mary, who suggested they see a dream analyst. Rachel was skeptical, but desperate for answers.\n\nThe dream analyst, Dr. Brown, listened intently as Rachel described her dreams. He nodded thoughtfully before explaining that she was experiencing a phenomenon known as nested dreams.\n\n\"Nested dreams are dreams within dreams, a sort of spiritual nesting doll,\" he explained. \"It's as if your mind is trapped in a never-ending cycle of dreams, each one leading to another. It's a rare occurrence, but it can be quite disorienting for the dreamer.\"\n\nRachel's heart sank. She had hoped for a simple explanation, something she could easily fix. But this was something much more complex.\n\nDr. Brown noticed her distress and quickly assured her that there was a way to break the cycle. \"We can enter your dreams and guide you out,\" he said. \"It's a risky procedure, but it's the only way to break the cycle and restore your sense of reality.\"\n\nRachel was hesitant, but eventually agreed to the procedure. She was put into a deep sleep and Dr. Brown and Mary entered her dream.\n\nAs they navigated the endless maze of hallways, they were confronted by the shadowy figure. He seemed to be guarding the way, blocking their path.\n\nDr. Brown tried to reason with him, but the figure was relentless. He lunged at them, his eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.\n\nRachel woke up with a scream, her body trembling. She was relieved to see Mary and Dr. Brown standing over her.\n\n\"It's okay, Rachel,\" Mary said, patting her hand. \"You're safe now.\"\n\nRachel looked around, disoriented. She was back in the real world, lying in a hospital bed.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked, her voice shaking.\n\n\"We were able to guide you out of the dream,\" Dr. Brown explained. \"But it was a close call. The figure was determined to keep you trapped in the dream cycle.\"\n\nRachel shuddered at the thought. \"Who was he?\" she asked.\n\nDr. Brown hesitated before answering. \"It's hard to say. It could be a manifestation of your own fears and insecurities. Or it could be something more sinister, a manifestation of pure evil.\"\n\nRachel's heart raced at the thought. She had always believed in the power of the mind, but she had never considered the possibility that her own thoughts could turn against her.\n\nShe left the hospital with a newfound understanding of the power of the mind. She vowed to be more mindful of her thoughts and to confront her fears head on.\n\nBut as she walked home, a sense of unease settled over her. She couldn't shake the feeling that the shadowy figure was still out there, waiting for her.\n\nRachel turned to Mary, her eyes wide with fear. \"Do you think he'll come back?\"\n\nMary squeezed her hand reassuringly. \"We'll face whatever comes our way together,\" she said. \"We're stronger than any nightmare.\"\n\nRachel hoped that Mary was right, but she couldn't shake the feeling that the true terror was yet to come.\n\nRachel tried to move on with her life, but she couldn't shake the feeling that the shadowy figure was still out there, waiting for her. She tried to focus on her work and her relationships, but every time she closed her eyes, he was there, lurking in the shadows of her mind.\n\nShe began to have doubts about Dr. Brown's theory that the figure was simply a manifestation of her own fears. There was something about him that felt otherworldly, something that seemed to go beyond the realm of the human mind.\n\nRachel confided in Mary about her doubts, and together they decided to do some research on their own. They spent hours scouring the internet, trying to find any information about nested dreams and the shadowy figure.\n\nWhat they found was disturbing. There were countless stories of people who had experienced nested dreams, and many of them reported being chased by a shadowy figure similar to the one Rachel had encountered.\n\nBut the most unsettling part was the theory that these figures were not just figments of the dreamer's imagination, but actual entities that could cross over into the real world.\n\nRachel's blood ran cold at the thought. Could it be that the shadowy figure was not just a nightmare, but something far more sinister?\n\nShe tried to push the thought out of her mind, but it was always there, lurking in the back of her mind. She found herself constantly looking over her shoulder, waiting for the figure to appear.\n\nOne night, as she was walking home from work, she thought she saw him. She turned to run, but her legs felt heavy and uncoordinated. She stumbled, falling to the ground.\n\nAs she lay there, panting and terrified, she felt a presence looming over her. She closed her eyes, waiting for the end.\n\nBut instead of the cold embrace of death, she felt a hand on her shoulder, gently lifting her up.\n\nShe opened her eyes to see Dr. Brown standing over her, a concerned look on his face.\n\n\"Rachel, what are you doing out here?\" he asked. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\n\nRachel couldn't find the words to explain what had just happened. She just stared at him, her mind racing.\n\nDr. Brown took her by the hand and led her back to his office. He sat her down on the couch and handed her a cup of tea.\n\n\"Tell me what's been going on,\" he said gently.\n\nRachel told him about the shadowy figure and her doubts about his true nature. Dr. Brown listened intently, a look of concern on his face.\n\nBut as Rachel spoke, she began to notice small discrepancies in Dr. Brown's responses. It was as if he already knew about the shadowy figure, as if he had been expecting her to bring it up.\n\nShe watched him carefully, trying to piece together the puzzle. And then it hit her.\n\nDr. Brown was part of a conspiracy against her. He had known about the shadowy figure all along, and he had been using her nested dreams as a way to manipulate her.\n\nRachel's heart raced as she tried to find a way out of the office. She had to get away from Dr. Brown, to find someone who could help her.\n\nBut as she reached for the door, she felt a sharp pain in her neck. She turned to see Dr. Brown standing over her, a syringe in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Rachel,\" he said as the world went black. \"But you were getting too close to the truth.\"\n\nRachel woke up disoriented and confused, her head throbbing with pain. She was in a room she didn't recognize, with no sign of Dr. Brown or any other familiar faces. As she tried to piece together what had happened, she heard a voice behind her.\n\n\"Welcome back, Rachel,\" the voice said. \"We've been waiting for you.\"\n\nRachel turned to see a group of people standing in the doorway, their eyes fixed on her. She didn't know who they were or what they wanted, but she knew one thing for sure: she was in grave danger. As she tried to back away, one of the strangers stepped forward and grabbed her by the arm, pulling her to her feet. Rachel screamed and struggled, but it was no use. She was completely at their mercy. \"Don't worry, Rachel,\" the stranger hissed. \"We'll take good care of you.\" Rachel shuddered at the promise in the stranger's voice, knowing that she was in for a long and terrifying journey. The end.",

        "text": "I’ve liked a guy for a while but I know he doesn’t like me back. Everything about him I find perfect. His eyes and his nose are cute. When he gets in trouble with the teacher. Or when he laughs and comments during class. The way he looks at me and does a little nod and says hi to me in class or in the hallway always makes me smile. Even when I try not to those small moments make me happy. He’s a nice guy and he’s funny. I even found out his favorite marvel character is spider man, which is mine too!! We haven’t had a lot of talks because I’m a shy person(I have social anxiety) but something about him that just keeps bringing me back to him every time I try to move on. The thing is.. he will never look at me that way. A few months ago I met this guy (let’s call him x) and we started talking. After a week he confessed things started going bad. He would on and off leave saying we shouldn’t be together. I had a very hard time because of it. I know it sounds bad because I shouldn’t go for his friend but that’s not what happened. While I tried getting over it I started noticing his friend (the guy I like). Everytime I felt down during the day just a simple hi or fist bump from him would make me happy. Obviously I got over x and just tried to stay away from guys or relationships. The fact that they are friends I knew he would never like me back. \n\nA few weeks ago x started texting me again. I didn’t really want to but I tend to try and be nice and texted back. We had some conversations and I decided to ask him about his friend.. immediately he asked if I liked him. I ended up saying yes. He gave me his Snapchat and I added him. Not even a few minutes later he added me back. I was so excited and happy but at the same time told myself I had no expectations it would go anywhere and I’d just try and be friends. We would send eachother snaps and even had a streak. Some days later x texted me again saying I shouldn’t go for him cause he was already talking to someone. I was so sad but decided to act like it wasn’t a big deal. We stopped sending eachother things and out of attachment I unadded him quick. I can’t lie that even know I think about him and hope maybe he’ll see me the way I see him.  \n\nThis is my first post so I hope it doesn’t sound awkward 😅 it’s currently 5 in the morning and I have a movie to watch tomorrow but I can’t sleep..yesterday was too much. Nvm it’s 6am cause currently I can’t post this due to the word count🥲🥲 trying to fix it though so",

        "text": "I thought my cat was opening my door at night, but it was something else.\n\nI have three cats, Beans (the oldest), Echo (the youngest female), and Alpha who isn’t important in this. \n\nMy cat Echo has recently had babies and they are almost two months old now. Her kittens are like little demons, they shit and piss on everything, so we had to put them in a smaller space right in front of my bedroom.\n\nMy other cat Beans only likes me out of all my family. She spends most of her time in my room with me. Ever since we moved the babies I have been waking up to Echo and her babies in my room. I had thought that Echo found out how to open my door but she can’t even reach my door handle since she is a runt, so my suspicions went to Beans who can open my door but Beans doesn’t like the babies. She just hisses at them and runs away. I got extremely frustrated with waking up to a bunch of cats in my room at 9-10am. So I decided to place an order for a security camera to put outside of my room.\n\nThe camera finally came so I decided to put it up outside of my door.\n\nThe first night I didn’t wake up to any cats in my room. Maybe it was Beans since I took her out of my room.\n\nThe second night I found something absolutely terrifying. There was a black figure standing outside of my door. Wtf. It stood there for 3 minutes completely still, then it opened my door and went inside. Holy shit what the hell just came into my room? \n\nI went online to purchase another camera to put inside my room to see whatever it was doing inside my room.\n\nThe other camera came and I set it up almost immediately. Time to see what it’s going to do tonight.\n\nI check the cameras and see that the black figure was standing there again. But this time it was staring right into the camera. Oh. My. God. It had big white eyes staring into my soul. It stood like that for 7 minutes this time then entered my room. I switch over to the camera inside my room. The figure walked over to my bed and stood there leaning over to staring at me. It stood like that for 10 minutes just staring. Then it walked over to my closet and went inside. What the hell do I do? It’s just sitting there in my closet.\n\nI walk over to my closet and take a peak in it. I see the black figure sitting there with its back turned towards me. It looks like it’s crying. All of a sudden it slowly turns it’s head to look directly at me. It gives me a bone chilling smile, it has so many sharp teeth in rows like a shark. It opens its mouth and let’s out an ear piercing high pitched scream. I quickly cover my ears and run out of my room.\n\nWhatever that thing is I think it’s trying to kill me. I’m home alone today and I keep seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye. I’m locked inside the bathroom and I can hear knocking and that thing trying to open the door. I don’t think I can finish this in time. I just hope that someone will come help me. Oh no it’s unlocked the door.",

        "text": " \n\nI had always dreamed of starting my own business, and after years of working for someone else, I finally took the plunge and started a freelance consulting firm. I was excited to be my own boss and to have the freedom to choose my own projects and clients.\n\nHowever, as the weeks went by, I found myself struggling to find enough work to keep my business afloat. I scoured the internet for networking opportunities and ways to get my name out there, but nothing seemed to be working.\n\nOne day, while browsing online, I stumbled upon a group of entrepreneurs who were hosting a networking event in my city. They met every fortnight to discuss their businesses, share tips and tricks, and make connections with other like-minded individuals.\n\nI was hesitant at first - I had always been a bit of an introvert and the thought of walking into a room full of strangers made me nervous. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in this business, I needed to put myself out there and take some risks.\n\nSo, I gathered my courage and attended the event. And to my surprise, it was actually really enjoyable! The other entrepreneurs were friendly and welcoming, and I even made a few connections that led to potential clients for my business.\n\nFrom then on, I made a point to attend the networking events every fortnight. It was a great way to meet new people, learn from others in my industry, and most importantly, find new clients. \n\nAs I attended more and more of these networking events, I began to notice something interesting. There were certain members of the group who were wildly successful - they had built massive businesses and seemed to be constantly in demand. Even so, they never looked down on me or made me feel inferior. They were always willing to share their knowledge and experience, and they welcomed me into the group with open arms.\n\nAs time went by, I also noticed that these successful members seemed to have a discrete inner group. They would often meet for coffee or lunch on their own, and although they never excluded me outright, I couldn't help feeling a little left out. I wondered what they were talking about and if there was something I could be doing to join their ranks.\n\nOne day, I mustered up the courage to ask Joachim, one of the successful members about it. \"Hey Jo, I noticed that you and some of the other successful members often meet up outside of these events,\" I said. \"Is there something I can do to join that inner circle?\"\n\nTo my surprise, Jo chuckled and patted me on the back. \"There is no inner circle,\" they said. \"We just enjoy each other's company and have found that meeting up regularly helps us to stay motivated and on track. You're more than welcome to join us anytime.\"\n\nOne day, Jo, a grandfatherly man in his late sixties, invited me to a gathering on his farm. \n\n\"It's just a casual get-together with some of the inner group,\" he said. \"I could use a hand with something if you don't mind. Bring an extra set of clothes, just in case.\"\n\nI was excited to be invited to such a special event, and I eagerly packed a bag with a change of clothes. When I arrived at the farm, Jo greeted me with a stun gun in his hand. \"\n\nAs we walked, Jo explained that he was actually going to cull some meat for the gathering, and that's what he needed my help with. My stomach sank at the thought, but I knew that this was a way of life on a farm and I didn't want to be rude.\n\nWe arrived at a pen with a single pig and a few farmhands waiting for us. When we got there, the farmhands opened an enclosure in the pen and the pig walked towards what looked like a big bowl of broth, which it eagerly slurped up. Jo walked up to the pig and, with a swift motion, stunned it with the stun gun.\n\nI watched in horror as the pig collapsed to the ground, twitching. \n\nThe farm hands quickly cut the neck of the pig, and Jo called me over. \"Come stand closer,\" he said. \"I want to show you something.\"\n\nI hesitantly approached, trying not to look at the pig's bleeding neck. Jo reached out and grabbed my arm, pulling me closer. Then, he drove his thumb into the gaping wound, motioning for me to bend down.\n\nI closed my eyes and tried to steady my breathing as Jo marked my forehead with the dripping blood on his thumb. \"This is a tradition among our inner group,\" he said. \"It's a way of showing solidarity and loyalty. You are now an official member of our group.\"\n\nI opened my eyes and looked up at Jo, unsure of what to say. I was both touched and disturbed by the ritual. On one hand, I was honored to be considered a part of this group. But on the other hand, I wasn't sure if I was ready for such a commitment.\n\nI was in a haze for the next hour as the other guests arrived, chugging away at a few beers while the farmhands finished the slaughtering of the pig. It was then grilled on a spit over an open fire, the smell making my stomach growl despite my earlier unease.\n\nI was barely paying attention as the other guests arrived, chugging away at a few beers as we waited for the pig to cook. Amongst the guests, I noticed an old man in ragged, downright filthy clothes. It was clear that the other guests around the open air barbecue revered and respected him, but I couldn't understand why.\n\nAs I watched the old man, he caught my eye and gave me a knowing nod. I couldn't help but feel a sense of shame wash over me - I was an outsider here, and I didn't belong.\n\nDuring the following week, two members of the group called me to offer opportunities to work with the marketing departments of their companies. I was so excited and overwhelmed. Things were finally looking up.\n\nI couldn't believe it. Just a few months ago, I had been struggling to find any work at all, and now I had two incredible opportunities right in front of me. I knew that working with these companies would be a huge step forward for my business, and I was determined to make the most of it.\n\nThree months went by as I adjusted to my new, more successful reality, regularly meeting up with Jo and the others. Things were finally looking up for my business, and I was grateful for the opportunities that the networking group had provided me.\n\nBut one day, Jo called me up and told me that it was time for me to take the next step. My stomach churned at the thought of what could be waiting for me, as I remembered how Jo had marked me with the pig's blood. Still, I didn't want to go back to being as broke as I was before, so I gathered my courage and agreed to meet with him.\n\nWhen I arrived at the designated meeting spot, which was at Brian, a group members house on the outskirts of town, Jo was already there waiting for me. As we entered the house, Jo turned to me and said \"You've done well for yourself, thanks in part to the connections and opportunities we've provided you,\" he said. \"But now it's time for you to show your commitment to the group. Are you willing to do whatever it takes to succeed?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, unsure of what he was asking of me. But then I remembered how far I had come, and I knew that I couldn't let my fear hold me back.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said firmly. \"I'm willing to do whatever it takes.\"\n\nJo nodded, satisfied with my answer. \"Good,\" he said. \"Then follow me.\"\n\nThe basement of Brian’s house had a separate entrance along the side of the house, and we walked down a stairs and entered a door into a room that was dimly lit with candles \n\nThe rest of the inner group was seated in a semi-circle facing an unknown old man who was dressed in the same filthy ragged clothes that I had seen him in at the pig barbeque.\n\n\"Who is that?\" I asked Jo quietly.\n\n\"That's Jacob,\" Jo replied. \"He's a very powerful man. You'll see.\"\n\nI watched as Jacob began to speak, his voice low and gravelly. \"You are all here because you want to be successful,\" he said. \"And I can help you achieve that success. But it won't be easy. It will require sacrifices.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The whole scene felt eerie and unsettling. But I was also curious, and I couldn't help wondering what kind of sacrifices Jacob was talking about.\n\nI gasped in shock, unsure of what was happening.\n\nJacob looked at me directly. \"Don't be frightened,\" he said. \"This is a small sacrifice we must make to the guardian spirit of our group. By consuming the blood of those who are part of this noble group, the spirit becomes one with us and helps guide us to success.\"\n\nI stared at him, wide-eyed and speechless. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was a far cry from the casual get-together I had expected.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Jacob said, sensing my discomfort. \"It's just a small cut and a few drops of blood. It's a small price to pay for the blessings of the guardian spirit.\"\n\nI was torn. On one hand, I wanted to succeed in my business and was willing to do whatever it took. On the other hand, the thought of making a blood sacrifice was terrifying to me.\n\nBut before I could make a decision , another member of the group I hadn't met before, stepped forward. \"I'll go first,\" he said, offering his arm to Jacob.\n\nI watched in horror\n\nIn the next few months, that turned to years, I began to feel a strange sense emanating from within me. It was like a voice or a presence, guiding my thoughts and actions. It told me what steps to take and what decisions to make. And as I followed its guidance, something miraculous happened - my business started to take off.\n\nI was getting more and more clients, and my income was steadily increasing. I was making more money than I had ever made before, and it seemed like everything I touched was turning to gold.\n\nI knew that this sense was something distinct from me, but I couldn't explain where it was coming from. All I knew was that ever since that day in Brian’s basement, I had been making better business decisions and my success had skyrocketed.",

        "text": "\nFor those out of the loop, heres what’s happened so far: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy1jx1/i_visited_my_family_over_the_holidays_something \n\n\nHello readers, Thank you all for your support and advice. Before I get into the update I want to address some of your questions and concerns.\n\nMultiple people asked me to call the police, They have been called but since nothing really happened to us we weren’t sure what to report. In the end we called them and asked them to do a welfare check. To our disappointment they found the house completely empty and my parents were nowhere to be found. \n\nI dont think demonic possession is involved, Theres definitely something going on but I dont feel like this is a fruitful avenue to pursue. I will, however, consult a priest. \n\nSo the missed calls, they were from a landline, possibly a payphone, so no texts were left and there were a few voicemails. None of them with any real content. A few had shallow breathing and a crackling in the background. These voicemails quickly ended as if someone had accidentally stayed on the line too long. As for what they were I have 2 theories. A: my “real” family trying to call me and warn me B: It was my family trying to call us back to the house.\n\nThe phone in the house being inoperative. I believe it was deliberately disconnected, Either to stop incoming calls or to stop use from making outside calls. \n\nMy girlfriend is scared but were doing fine. The loss of King has been tough on us. I wish I had taken his collar or something, It just didn’t occur to me at the time. \n\nThe hole. I couldn’t find any natural way to mention the hole to the police. They didn’t mention anything to me either. To further describe the hole, It was a large deep ditch, I couldn’t see the bottom from where I was standing but it was about 20 feet across and tapered inward, getting deeper towards the center before a steep edge where a smaller pit was. The smaller pit I couldn’t see the bottom of but it was the size of a well. \n\nAny other questions or comments will be answered in future parts. \n\nHeres whats happened in the past week: \n\nThe first day was normal, We unpacked what little luggage we had in our car. We left a large amount of our belongings in the house. The next morning we called the police and tried to call back the number that had left so many missed calls, This proved unfruitful. I had trouble sleeping that night. I kept getting spooked by normal small noises around the house. Scared to even get out of bed. \n\nIn the morning I sat with my coffee staring out into the backyard. This is when I noticed the dirty set of footprints tracking across our porch. They were large boot prints circling the house. It might seem immature but I cried, I was so exhausted and stressed the rollercoaster of emotions finally weighed on me. I showed my girlfriend but she was only interested in rationalizing. She explained it was probably a neighbor or someone we had doing yard work. I agreed with her to avoid conflict, I knew it was a lie. \n\nLater in the evening I was smoking out back, a habit I had successfully broken only recently. From the edge of our yard I heard a familiar heart breaking sound.  A light, subtle, palpable, jingling noise. I shot up in my chair, a mix of excitement, relief, and fear coursed through my veins. I slowly walked to the edge of the yard. I approached a crouched low form stalking int the brush, I was met with a low threatening growl.  As I backed away I could see the glint of bared teeth in the encroaching moonlight. Possibly also the reflective eyes of an animal. I retreated to the house and didn’t mention anything to my girlfriend, But I’m sure now she knew something happened. All night we listened to the sounds in the yard, The running, growling, barking, and the heartbreaking jingle. Occasionally a scratch at one of the doors or windows. At some point I fell asleep from the exhaustion. \n\nYesterday Morning I ventured outside to take a look, again, paw prints circled my home. Some of the prints were on the wall, where the beast jumped up to peer into our home. \nI went to work as if nothing was going on. At work I couldn’t help worrying, I couldn’t get anything done. On my way home I received a call from my girlfriend that someone was trying to get inside the house. Im usually a very safe driver but My foot was to the floor the whole way home. When I arrived the door was wide open, A large footprint in the center of the door, With splinters of the frame littering our front room. I feared the worst and called out to my girlfriend. She screamed from the bedroom. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and rushed in.   \nThere was no one in the room besides us and i comforted my girlfriend as she told me what happened \n\n“ It was your father but there’s something wrong, its not him. “ She whimpered in my arms.  Before I could even process what had happened a sound came from the other room, This is when I remembered that the door was left wide open. Peeking around the kitchen I came face to face with him, my father. He looked taller In filthy ragged clothes.His skin was loose, pale, and sickly. His eye’s dark and inhuman. Something subtle about the eyes were what gives it away. The angle or shape is just so slightly different. He lurched forward slowly before speaking, In a disjointed and labored tone. “ you know, you really upset your mother leaving without telling anybody … We were supposed to have a nice family christmas! I was going to ask you to come to work with me. Now i want you to apologize! I want you to come back and- “ He was cut off. \n\nAs he made his advance I kept the knife hidden. Before he could finish his reprimand I pounced slamming the knife down into his collarbone. An unholy shriek rang out into the room, so loud it left my ears ringing. A torrent of black blood spewed forth onto me and the carpet as my father scuttled out of the house on all fours. The blood burned my skin and left dark stains on the carpet. I sat crying over the event. \n\nThis morning I cleaned up the house a bit as we debated calling the police, we came to the conclusion that we were too deep. I had potentially just killed someone I had previously conducted a search on, We figured we would just fold off for now, we could reassess In the future. In the evening I get this odd feeling, like a call. It was one word over and over, “ HOME” It rang out in my head all night. \n\nIn the last hour I was helping replace our front door when I heard a rustle from the nearby bushes. I cant recall what made me pursue it. The growling came as I knelt down In front of the bush. I reached out an arm. The growling fell slightly. “ King?” I called out tears welling. In an instant the form struck forward. I was able to block it with my arm, \nThick teeth sunk deep into my flesh as I flung the dog away and grabbed at my wound. I ran back into the house to bandage it. I am sitting at the computer typing this up as the call plays over and over in my mind. I have to go . \n\nHOME HOME HOME HOME HOME HOME HOME HOME HOME HOME",

        "text": " The call that mom died was soul crushing. Her Alzheimer's had gotten pretty bad and, apparently, she walked off into the woods one night and never returned. They still haven’t recovered her body, but the consensus is that she’s not coming back. The search went on for a month before we started planning the memorial service.\n\nBut you don’t need to hear about that. It’s the effects of her death that matter. Now, obviously I’m devastated over it, but I wasn’t as close with my parents as I should have been. I mean that in both the relationship sense and the physical sense. They sent me to live with my aunt Brynn when I was around seven years old. At the time I didn’t know it was going to be a permanent thing— it was all so sudden. One day I was living a quiet life in the middle of nowhere with my parents, the next I was with Brynn in the crowded city. I’d only met her a handful of times before then, so that mixed with the culture shock of my new surroundings was uncomfortable to say the least. They wanted me to get a proper education at a good school, but I don’t know why they couldn’t have prepared me a little better. It’s not like they didn’t care; they visited as often as they could and called me every day.\n\nJesus, I keep ranting. Anyways, mom’s death pretty much broke my dad. They’d been married since eighteen and I’ve never seen any two people more in love. I was mad on their behalf when the police investigated my dad to check if he had any involvement in whatever happened to her. Obviously, they didn’t find anything on him. Dad was so quiet after that. We couldn’t get ahold of him over the phone, so me and Brynn had to drive for hours to visit. Even then, it took him a while to answer the door and he was pretty unresponsive when we tried to talk. He just stared into nothing with a distant expression. His black hair was almost completely gray. Clearly he was distraught, so Brynn and I decided that being isolated in that tiny house wasn’t good for him. He didn’t have much to say when we suggested he move to the city. From the little we got out of him, it seemed like he was both pained and attached to the memories the house brought him.\n\nI have to say, being back brought a sense of nostalgia. I remember running around in the yard, cutting firewood with my dad, cooking with mom— Anyways, um, his health was worsening and he couldn’t stay there. And, unfortunately, he was starting to show signs of dementia as well. I’m guessing it was caused by her death, but I’m not a therapist. Eventually, after a month or two, we got him to agree. As fate would have it, the lease on my apartment was almost up. One thing led to another and there I was, moving back into my childhood home. The timing was good and someone needed to take care of the place while dad was gone. Plus, I’ve always been a fan of nature and it was so much quieter in the woods. Even at night, I couldn’t hear crickets chirping. Absolute silence.\n\nThe biggest downside at the time was that if I needed to buy or do something, I’d have to drive about thirty minutes over to the town nearby. But it was worth it. I felt closer to my mom and got to remember some of the things I’d forgotten. Like, there were still marks on the kitchen doorway where she measured my height. And where I’d carved a drawing of me and my imaginary friend on the back of the shed.\n\nEverything was great for a while. But then I saw it. Two months in. It was the middle of the afternoon and I was just walking outside when I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I was being watched. As I turned around, I noticed something on the road. Before I could get a good look at it, it ran off into the woods. I went back inside for a while because I was scared it was a black bear or some other animal. But, I didn’t see anything for a few months after that. I’d pretty much forgotten about it until it ran in front of my car as I was driving home. My heart practically leaped out of my chest as it raced onto the road just a few feet ahead of me. I slammed the breaks and swerved the car, scared at first that it was someone’s dog. The tires screeched across the road and the car tilted slightly as it pulled to a jolting stop. I hadn’t heard or felt anything collide with the car, but I still grabbed my flashlight out of the glove box and opened the car door. Despite the warm weather, a chill ran up my spine when I heard it scamper away. That *definitely* didn’t sound like a dog’s feet against the pavement. It was pretty quiet, but the steps of its paws were uneven and soft, so it didn’t have hooves or long nails. Regardless, I stepped out of my car and shone the light around. No blood anywhere, no animal to be seen. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up again and I glanced into the silent forest. I couldn’t hear anything walking around, which was an issue since the animal was *just* there and had only moved what sounded like a couple of feet. As far as I could see, it had disappeared.\n\nNeedless to say I was a bit unnerved when I got home that night. I wondered for hours what the animal might have been and where it could’ve gone. I thought about it over and over, picturing what I’d seen. It didn’t exactly look like a dog, I realized. Its back was arched and its legs were too long and bent at the wrong angle. But I summed it up to the bad lighting and panic of the situation.\n\nI saw it more often after that. Something would move on the side of the road occasionally, then more frequently. Never once was I able to see it clearly or long enough to tell what it was. But it was certainly starting to scare me. Sometimes it was shorter and sometimes it was taller. Of course, I couldn’t be sure that it was the same animal every time, but I didn’t see animals very often. Even then, they were usually birds. Also, I kind of had a feeling. A horrible, sickly and dreadful feeling that I can’t really compare to any other. Whatever this animal was, it was horrible. Adding to the horror of the situation was the fact that people’s pets were starting to go missing. Cats, dogs, even a bird at one point. Missing pet posters were popping up everywhere, both on trees near the road and even in town.\n\nI spent less and less time at the house, choosing to go to the town’s café instead. The town was pretty small, a place you’d drive past and forget about almost immediately. I had a few vague memories of heading into town. Once watching a movie with my parents in the small one-screen theater, waiting at the mechanic with my dad until our car was fixed, waiting again as my mom used the payphone to call someone. And I remembered begging my mom to buy me and my imaginary friend each a cookie at the café.\n\nIt was pretty empty in the café, just as I remembered. I sat down at the same booth I always sat at, the same one that me and my mom sat at eighteen years ago. The table’s corner was chipped and the seat across from me had a small tear on it, revealing the stuffing inside. I took a deep breath, getting a whiff the coffee being brewed behind the counter, as I put down my laptop. I was just about to open it when I saw the missing poster for ‘Mittens,’ a tabby cat I’ve seen on the side of the road before. It made me think of the animal I kept seeing. Was it killing these pets? There had to be some reason they were suddenly disappearing—\n\n“Damn, another one?” Maddie said, startling me. She noticed my reaction and giggled, “Sorry, didn’t realize you were so deep in thought,”\n\nMaddie was one of the two baristas in the café. She was the more talkative one and was the one who always took my order. But by now she’d stopped asking, since I only ever got the same thing: an omelet and caffe mocha, both of which she placed down in front of me.\n\n“You okay?” She asked, tucking her brown hair behind her ear. I could never quite place it, but Maddie looked familiar. She was around my age, but I didn’t have many specific memories of anyone in town from when I was younger.\n\n“Um, yeah,” I glanced at the poster once more before meeting her eyes, “I just— I keep seeing this weird animal around my house,”\n\n“Ohhh, that’s creepy. What is it?”\n\n“No clue,” I immediately regretted bringing it up. Talking about it made me uncomfortable.\n\nShe nodded towards my laptop, “How’s the book coming along?”\n\n“Slowly,” I said as I opened my laptop. In the brief moment before the screen turned on, I caught a glimpse of myself and the bags forming under my eyes, “Haven’t been getting much sleep lately,”\n\n“Why’s that?”\n\nI shrugged, “I’m not sure,” That was a lie. The house had… changed. What was once a peaceful setting had become unsettling. Nothing significant; I wasn’t rushing to move out of the house or anything. Still, I kept the curtains closed.\n\nMaddie lingered there for a moment, only moving when I looked back up at her, “Well, let me know if you need anything else,” She said with a smile before leaving. I spent the rest of my time trying to write, though I didn’t make much progress. Eventually I just gave up and ate my cold food, thinking about the animal in the woods. It really confused me. Its height was inconsistent and I had no clue what it could be. When I drove home that night, I saw it moving away from the road again. As I parked my car, though, I felt watched again. I looked around but couldn’t see much in the darkness. Still, I had to go inside. I sat in my car for a minute, trying to convince myself that I was being paranoid. A minute turned into a few minutes, the feeling not going away. I took a glance at my rear view mirror and could’ve sworn that I saw a pair of eyes staring at me from the woods. But, of course, there was nothing there. After spending too long being stuck in my car, I finally decided to just get out. My heart was racing and I felt like a moron. It was probably a dog or something. Why was I getting so worked up? Still, when I opened the car door, my brain screamed at me to shut it. My breathing quickened and I practically ran to my house. I was thankful that, since my neighbors were far away, I didn’t have to lock my door. Unlocking my door would’ve taken too long and I may have ended up sleeping in my car in that case. I slammed the door shut hard enough to shake the wall and immediately locked it. I cursed myself for being so scared. What was the point of locking the door if it was an animal?\n\nThat thought made my hair stand up and I regretted thinking it. Animals could only do so much when you were in your house. People though, that was a different story. But no, it had to be an animal. The thing I’d almost run over didn’t look human. I willed myself to think of other things, but still wasn’t able to sleep that night. As soon as the sun rose the next day, I left my house to go into town. As I closed the door behind me, I noticed something on the street. Someone was standing there. This startled me as I hadn’t seen my neighbors before. My eyes rested on them for only a second before they ran off into the woods. I got goosebumps and stood frozen for a while. I felt that horrible sickly feeling, but far more intense than it had been before.\n\nWorse than that, the person I’d seen was not normal. They had no clothes on their dark skin and their eyes were completely white. And, strangely, hidden beneath my feelings of fear and nausea was a sense of familiarity. Of course, I didn’t process all of this at once. The only thing I felt in that moment was a primal fear that I’d never felt before. Despite my brain screaming a multitude of instructions at me, my muscles were paralyzed. A cold feeling shot from my head to my feet and my heart was pounding against my ribcage. I stood there for who knows how long before shakily retreating back indoors. Once in the house, my body jolted into action and I locked every door and window, my whole body trembling. My mind was reeling for hours as I processed the person, or creature, I’d seen.\n\nWhat was it? Was it the thing I kept seeing on the road? Was it a person? Certainly not a normal one. And why were they next to the road all the time? Were they hurt? But then why would they run? Had I even seen them correctly?\n\nWas anything I’d seen even real?\n\nI considered the past few weeks and how surreal they had been. I’d been more scared of this thing than I’d previously realized. Even before having seen it, I had a horrible feeling. There was something *wrong* with it. It wasn’t real, right? I was mistaken, or delusional. That would be a whole different issue. I didn’t know what to believe. I sat for hours until I finally called Brynn.\n\n“Hey-”\n\n“I think I’m going crazy,” My voice came out raspy and weaker than I’d intended. Speaking my thoughts brought tears to my eyes; it made it more real.\n\nBrynn took a moment before responding, “Are you okay? What happened?” She said in a calm voice with an undertone of concern.\n\n“I just—,” I glanced at the drawn curtains, “...I saw someone— something. I don’t know. I don’t think they’re real- I’m scared to leave the house,”\n\n“Okay, what did you see? Do you need me to head over there?”\n\nGod, I felt like a child, “It— they, um… their eyes were weird. Like, it didn’t look like they had pupils, and they were staring at me when I left my house—,” My voice cracked as I spoke. Talking about it just made me feel worse. What if it was listening? I wasn’t going to check, “I don’t know. I keep seeing things. Stuff on the side of the road. Maybe I’m hallucinating, I don’t know,”\n\n“Okay, take a deep breath,” I heard her moving around, “I’m heading over,”\n\nEven though I was relieved that I wouldn’t be alone, I did notice that it would be night by the time she arrived. Something about that made me feel sick, “Are you sure? Don’t you have work tomorrow?”\n\n“Work can wait,” I heard a door close and, shortly after, the sounds of her car starting up.\n\nI couldn’t shake that dreadful feeling, “What about dad? Will he be okay?”\n\n“He’s been self-reliant for years, I think he can handle a night alone,” She paused, “Do you not want me to go?”\n\n“No, um—” I didn’t know why I was acting so odd. It was good if she came over, I’d be able to calm down, “I’m just… nothing. I—” I stopped as a twig snapped outside.\n\nMy heart began to race again. My breathing was quick and my skin became clammy as I listened. Brynn’s voice startled me, “Are you okay?”\n\nIt took me a moment to find my voice, “...Yeah,” I said, barely above a whisper.\n\n“What’s happening?”\n\nI didn’t want to speak. I wanted to run and hide somewhere in the house, not stay on the couch in the dark, empty living room, “Nothing. I just— I heard something outside. A branch,”\n\n“I can hear you’re scared. What do you think it is?”\n\nI was silent for a long moment. I didn’t want to say it, “It could be a deer,”\n\n“Do you think it’s a deer?” I didn’t answer, “Honey, you’re gonna be okay. I’ll be there in a bit,”\n\nI only realized once I was lightheaded, but my breathing was still too quick. I tried to take a deep breath, but it was difficult to get the air down past the lump in my throat. I shook my head. What I’d seen couldn’t have been real.\n\n“Saul? Are you okay?”\n\n“Yeah. I’m just anxious,” I said, running a hand through my hair and finally catching my breath.\n\n“When’s the last time you slept?”\n\nMy face flushed as I tried to think of an answer. It had been a while since I fell asleep for more than a couple hours, “A few days,”\n\n“And have you eaten anything?”\n\n“Um, not much,”\n\n“Okay, I’ll be there in a few hours. I need you to go eat something in the meantime. Can you do that for me?”\n\n“Yeah,” Honestly, I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to be able to stand up. I was still shaken and felt weak after the adrenaline rush. After a few minutes, I willed my legs to move and I stood. The air around me felt so still and empty. I walked into the kitchen, turning on all the lights, and continued talking to Brynn. Time passed slowly, but I felt slightly better after I ate and Brynn assured me everything would be fine.\n\nBut Brynn never arrived that night. She paused our call when my dad started texting her and never called back. I tried reaching her multiple times during the night, failing each time. I spiraled to a worse state than I was in before. Now I was alone and had no clue what happened to Brynn. That ended up being another sleepless night, despite how exhausted my body was. Similarly, the next day, and then the next, I got no sleep. I didn’t leave my house, didn’t even look out the windows. My phone died at some point or another, but I didn’t know where my charger was and was too tired to look for it. Those two days were horrible. I was exhausted but unable to sleep, scared but unsure of whether what I feared was even real.\n\nEventually exhaustion got the better of me and I fell asleep on the couch.\n\nFor how long? I don’t know. I just remember being awoken by knocking at the door. I was still tired, but the knocking made me jolt upright. It went on for a moment longer before pausing. Then silence. That silence felt like an eternity, “Saul? Are you in there?” A familiar voice called out.\n\nHearing my name made my skin crawl, but I realized that it was a person’s voice. I wanted it to be Brynn’s, but it wasn’t. It took me a while to realize that it was Maddie, since she’s probably the last person I expected to hear at my doorstep. I got off the couch and made my way to the front door, reaching for the door handle. But, as my fingers touched the cold metal, my body froze. What if it wasn’t Maddie? I’d spent so long hiding in here, I didn’t feel like letting it in after three days of hiding. I pressed my ear against the door and listened, not hearing anything. When she knocked again, I nearly fell back, “This isn’t the right place, is it?” I heard her mutter under her breath. I heard footsteps and rushed over to the nearest window. Low and behold, it was actually Maddie. I hurried over to the front door and opened it, feeling the sun for the first time in days.\n\n“Maddie!” I called out, and she seemed startled. She stared at me for a moment before walking over, a strange expression on her face. It was then that I realized I must’ve looked like shit. I’d been too excited to see another person to notice.\n\nShe stopped on the other side of the doorway, “This is really your house?”\n\nThat wasn’t what I expected her to ask, “Um, yeah, why?”\n\n“And how long have you lived here?”\n\n“Well, I recently moved in. I used to live here when I was younger though—”\n\nI was cut off as Maddie hugged me. I didn’t know what to say, so I was relieved that she spoke next, “It’s been so long,” She said as she stepped back. She scanned my face for a moment before continuing, “Yeah, I didn’t recognize you either. We were friends before you moved. Remember? We used to try and catch fishes down at the lake,”\n\nIt took a second for my brain to recall the memory, “Oh. OH! Maddie! Yeah, it’s been a while,” Recalling my childhood was a welcome distraction from my current state of mind, though the breeze that pushed into my house brought me back to the present. I glanced into the woods for a brief moment, “Um, do you want to come inside?”\n\n“Sure! I’d love to catch up,” She said, stepping past me, “Wow, it’s the exact same as I remember it,”\n\nI didn’t respond. Instead, I was staring into the woods again. When a twig snapped nearby, I almost panicked. But then I saw the source. In the dark underneath the trees, I could make out the silhouette of a deer. I immediately felt like an idiot. Locked myself up in my house for two days because I heard a deer step on a branch and was convinced there was some sort of demon stalking me. Jesus, I needed a therapist. Behind me, I heard Maddie giggle.\n\n“They didn’t get it fixed?” She asked as she touched a corner of the wall that was missing a small chunk. That damage, I remembered, was caused because of us while we were running around the house.\n\nI shook my head as I closed the door, feeling stupid but somewhat relieved at the same time. I still had to sort out why I was seeing that weird creature, but I was more certain that it was in my head. Maddie and I caught up with each other. We talked a little bit about our childhood but mostly spoke about what was happening recently. Though it’s how I’d spent the past few days, I didn’t mention that I’d been hiding from a creepy creature stalking me from the woods. Our conversation wasn’t too important, but I felt a lot better afterwards.\n\nThat feeling was soon stripped from me once I charged my phone. I had a few missed calls from yesterday, most of them from dad and one from the officer working on finding my mom. My heart sank. I wanted them to say that she was found, but I knew that wasn’t going to happen. I called dad, though it was Brynn who answered after just two rings.\n\nBefore I could get a word out, Brynn spoke, “Saul? Are you okay?”\n\n“Um, yeah. Are you?”\n\nBrynn sighed, “Yes, right. Sorry about the delayed communication. I got into an accident as I was driving over. Nothing to worry about,”\n\n“What happened?” I asked quickly.\n\n“Nothing. An animal jumped in front of my car and I swerved so I wouldn’t hit it. The only thing that was hurt was my car and phone. Now what’s going on with you?”\n\nI felt sick and ignored her question, “What animal was it?”\n\n“Honey, I’m okay. I’m pretty sure it was a dog,”\n\n“Was it big with a black coat?” I asked, failing to moderate the panic rising in my voice.\n\nShe paused, “How’d you know?”\n\nI sank down onto my bed and took in a shaky breath. Every time I made my mind up about this thing, it threw a curveball, “The same thing happened to me recently,” She was about to say something, but I spoke first, forcing myself to say it, “I don’t think it was a dog,”\n\n“It—,”\n\n“Or a bear,”\n\nShe sighed, “Is this about the person you saw?\n\nHer tone caught me off guard. She sounded sad, “Well, yeah,”\n\n“Have you seen it again?”\n\n“Not really,” I said, glancing out the window\n\n“Have you gotten more sleep?”\n\n“Yes, but I’m telling you. I saw that thing crawl in front of my car,” I said, a chill running up my spine as I recalled the night it happened.\n\n“We… we can talk about this later. That isn’t the reason I called,” My stomach flipped as I remembered what this was probably about, “They found… they found something,” I couldn’t see her face but I could tell it was difficult for her to say, “Your mom, they found some of her hair in the woods. And there was some blood,” Tears sprang to my eyes. I knew she probably wasn’t coming back, but I didn’t want to hear about what they found left of her.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, I spoke up, “Is that all?” I asked quietly.\n\n“Well, I—,” Brynn paused and I could hear a voice in the background, “Oh, um, your dad wants to speak with you,”\n\nI sat up as she passed the phone along. Dad was still pretty quiet and I was curious about what he had to say. I waited for him to speak, but heard nothing, “Hello?” I listened closer and heard a few raspy croaks from the other end. I heard Brynn worrying about him having a sore throat in the background, “Are you okay?”\n\nDad coughed and paused for a moment before saying something odd, “Is the line broken?”\n\n“Um, no, I can hear you,”\n\n“The line cannot be broken,” He said, and for the first time in a while I heard distress in his voice.\n\n“What’s this about? Is something wrong?”\n\n“Is the line intact?”\n\nBrynn interjected, “Okay, I think that’s enough for now,” She said as she took the phone. I could vaguely hear my dad’s protests in the background. Brynn and I spoke for a little while longer before ending call. Nothing significant happened that day. It happened at night.\n\nThat was the first night I’d been able to get a proper sleep, so needless to say I was annoyed when I randomly woke up. I was still groggy and didn’t know why I was awake, but I decided to use the bathroom and get a glass of water before going back to bed. As I was filling my glass, though, I heard something. A repetitive series of dings. I looked around but I could tell it was coming from outside. I thought the sound was familiar, so I approached a window and parted the curtains. My suspicions were proven when I saw a car idling just down the road. Trying to look past the headlights, I noticed something concerning about the car. The doors were left wide open, no driver in sight. The dings went on and on and, as I stared, I noticed something else. I recognized the car. It was my dad’s car.\n\nIt wasn’t smart to barge out into the night with no weapon and still wearing my pj’s, but my dad was acting weird earlier and now his car was sitting abandoned on the street. At first I was walking, but as my concern grew so did my pace. Eventually I was running until I reached the car. Passing the blinding headlights, I moved to the driver’s seat and glanced inside. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary other than the fact that it was unoccupied. No blood or signs of struggle. Honestly, I was expecting to uncover some horrifying scene when I looked inside. Still, something had to be wrong. And as I thought that, I noticed the empty shotgun shells on the passenger's seat. That made me even more concerned. Living in the middle of the woods meant that my dad had a shotgun at the ready, but only for self defense as far as I was aware. I didn’t think he hunted, but even if he did, why would he come *here* and in the middle of the night? I got concerned over his mental state and checked the back seats to see if there were any more clues. What if he was worse than we thought? He could be in danger. Just then, I heard a shot ring out in the distance, causing me to jump. I stepped past the car and stared into the woods, though I could see nothing, “Dad?!” I called out, receiving no answer.\n\nIf he was tired and in a bad mental state, I couldn’t let him wander off into the woods with a gun. I couldn’t let nature take my only other parent. As I was heading back to my house to grab my shoes, I had another thought. What if he was trying to… he wouldn’t use it on himself, right?. That gunshot— no. Cold sweats broke out on my body and I sprinted towards my house. I rushed around frantically, wrenching on my shoes and heading back outside. As I passed my car, I flung the door open and grabbed my flashlight. Then, I ran. I ran in the direction of the gunshot, praying that he was okay. He wouldn't do that, would he? Did Brynn know he left? Probably not. There were a few times where I almost ran into a tree, but my mind was too panicked to be careful. I stumbled over the uneven ground more than a few times, but it was hard to even think. Thoughts, horrible thoughts, were rushing through my mind. I ran for so long that my lungs burned. Even then I continued, occasionally calling out to my dad. My legs ached but I ignored the pain. Adrenaline carried me for a while, but I eventually tripped. It was bound to happen with how recklessly I was running, but I caught myself on a tree. My foot had slipped on some leaves. Though, when I looked down at them, they looked strange. I shone my light down at where I tripped and almost threw up. Blood. A trail of it.\n\nI fell back against the tree as my chest tightened and I tried my best not to freak out. There wasn’t much I could do, though, since my heart was already beating far faster than it should’ve. I tried to breathe but it was nearly impossible. I couldn’t think. All that was going on in my head was that I was going to find my dad’s dead body. I felt like I was going to asphyxiate right there. The air didn’t seem to be reaching my lungs. I sank down to the floor, my eyes latched onto the blood stains on the ground. Trail. Someone— something maybe— was dragged. Maybe, hopefully, he was hunting for some strange reason. Maybe he was alive. I had to check. I had to be sure. My heart was still pounding against my ribcage but I eventually got my legs to work. Pushing myself off the ground, I started forward again, though now at a much slower rate. I followed the blood trail, which went on for longer than I would’ve expected, desperately clinging onto hope that my dad was alive. I walked for who knows how long, the only sound I heard being my uneven breathing. That was until I heard something ahead of me. Leaves being stepped on. I took a deep breath and lifted my flashlight higher to see further down the path. Something was moving just out of the light’s range. My first and only thought was that it was my dad. I sprinted towards the mass on the ground, stopping dead about eight feet away from it.\n\nDefinitely not my dad.\n\nThe person I’d seen before, if I could even call it a person, was on all fours. I immediately got an image of the animal that had run in front of my car. This thing. It was this thing. Up close, I could see some disturbing details I had never noticed. They weren’t dark skinned, their entire body was burnt and charred. A charcoal-like smell wafted from them and their skin was cracked. Their limbs seemed too thin, as if their muscles had shrunken. And, maybe even grosser, their face was hovering just above the ground, licking the blood off of the path.\n\nMy joints locked up and I stared at it for a moment. The creature ignored me as it continued to lick the blood from the floor. When it put one hand forwards to move in my direction, I instinctively took a step back. As my feet crunched the leaves beneath me, it’s head snapped up to look in my direction. Its eyes seemed to bore into me. We stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. Then it took a step forward.\n\nMy body snapped into action and I whirled around, bolting in the opposite direction. Behind me, I heard it running on all fours. My first thought was to run into my house. It was then that I realized that I didn’t know where my house was. I used to play in the woods when I was younger, but it was always during the day and I always made sure to keep track of where I was. In my panic to find my dad, I hadn’t focused on where I was going. I didn’t dare look behind me as I ran away, even when I heard it getting closer. And closer. I forced my legs to go as fast as they could, but it was faster. But then it stopped. I suddenly couldn’t hear its feet on the ground. Even still, I continued to run. I didn’t look behind me once. But I still wasn’t safe.\n\nSuddenly, just a few feet ahead of me, it crawled into view. I don’t know where it came from, but I tried to stop. It was too sudden and I fell backwards, slamming to the ground with a thud. Ignoring the pain that radiated from my arms and back, I scrambled to prop myself up. It was too late. I froze as the creature slowly crawled around me just five feet away. It observed me with blank eyes, circling me. I couldn’t hear anything over the sound of my rapidly beating heart. After a few very long and uncomfortable moments, it stopped circling and instead moved closer, crawling parallel to my body. I was frozen up until it reached my legs. I pushed myself backwards away from it, shaking too much to even try standing. It matched my pace and got closer and closer until we were face to face. Its odor burned my nose and I felt like throwing up. So close, I caught a disturbing glance into one of the bigger cracks on its face, spotting some sort of burnt red and yellow tissue inside. It tilted its head to the side and leaned forwards. I couldn’t think, I could barely breathe. Speaking of breathing, I could hear it raspily trying to suck in a breath. But, strangely, there was a faint gurgling sound coming from inside of it. All of a sudden, though, it backed up slightly. Then it reached a charred hand towards my face, its black and overgrown nails sharper than they should’ve been. As its skin stretched with its movements, I could hear the burnt skin cracking.\n\nI was going to scream, back away from it. But it beat me to it. Starting from its feet, a red light glowed from in between the cracks of its skin. Within seconds the light spread through its entire body, ending with its eyes. It opened its mouth and screamed, releasing a breath of hot air into my face. Even the interior of its mouth glowed red as its ear piercing screech filled the woods around us. Then it backed away. Actually, it seemed to be dragged away by some force I could not see. It clawed at the ground, trying its best to fight whatever was taking it away. Moments later, it disappeared into the darkness. I stayed there for a long while, confused and horrified, unsure of what just happened. Time passed and my heart rate slowly returned to normal. I felt like crying, or screaming, but my brain seemed to be severed from my body. So I laid there.\n\nEventually I heard something. Even then, it took my body a moment to grab my flashlight and look around. My heart stopped for a moment when I saw the silhouette of a person. Before I had the chance to panic, I realized that it was my dad. I cried out in relief and didn’t get up, my muscles aching too much to move. My adrenaline had run out and I could feel everything. My back still hurt and my lungs burned, even though my breathing had mostly returned to normal.\n\nDad was silent. He slowly walked towards me and it took me a minute to realize that he was covered in blood. I was concerned that he’d been hurt, but then I saw what he was holding. In his right hand was his rifle, and in the left was the severed antler of a deer. Blood dripped from it and skin still dangled from where it had been torn off. My dad followed my line of sight and discarded the antler, approaching me. He looked at me with a complex expression. There was a mix of sadness, guilt and fear in his eyes. He reached over to help me up, but when his bloodied hand touched my skin I recoiled. Neither of us spoke. Even though I had a million questions to ask, I didn’t have the energy. Instead, I stood and let him lead the way back home. On the way over I looked at just how much blood was on his body. Most of it was on his arms, though some still stained the front of his pants and shirt. We walked for a long time until we reached the house. His car was still on and my front door was still wide open. Once we were inside, I opened my mouth to speak, but he moved past me and into the bathroom, leaving his rifle leaning against the wall. I heard him turn on the sink but he’d left the door ajar, so I walked over, “What happened?” My voice wavered as I said it, though it came out a bit more accusatory than I’d intended. He didn’t answer, “Dad, what’s going on?” I asked louder this time.\n\nI heard him take a breath, “Are you okay?” He said with a tired voice.\n\n“No! What happened? Why are you here? What was that thing?!”\n\nIt took him a while to answer, “The line is almost broken,” He said, sounding like he was about to cry.\n\n“What the fuck does that mean?!” I didn’t intend to sound rude, but he was being so vague and I was tired of not knowing what was going on.\n\n“Darcy—” He choked a sob.\n\nI froze. What did mom have to do with any of this? My brain immediately went to the darkest places it could think of, “What about mom? Do you know something?” There was fear in my voice now. I was praying for a good answer. He sniffed and turned off the sink. After a minute or so, he opened the door, having cleaned most of the blood off his arms and collecting himself, “What does this have to do with mom?”\n\nHe walked past me again and across the house. I watched him as he entered his old room. Currently, I’m sleeping in the guest room. I hadn’t touched or moved a single thing from theirs so far. Still, he walked in, shutting the door behind him. I followed and listened as he opened his desk drawer, shuffling some papers around.\n\nI knocked, “Dad? What are you doing?” He didn’t respond, “Can we talk about what happened?” He stayed in there for another few minutes before opening the door again. He paused for a moment as he looked at me, then walked back into the living room and grabbed his rifle, turning to leave, “Wh— Where the fuck are you going?! You need to tell me what’s going on!” I rushed over and walked in between him and the door.\n\n“I *can’t*,” He said as he brushed past me.\n\n“What the fuck do you mean you can’t?! Just open your fucking mouth and tell me!” I was livid. I was being stalked by a strange creature that he likely knew about, but he wasn’t telling me anything. He paused with his hand on the knob and glanced at his open bedroom door for a long moment until I followed his gaze. Nothing. When I looked back to him, he’d opened the front door and walked outside, “So you’re just leaving?!”\n\n“Yes,” He called back sternly.\n\n“I thought you died! You can’t just leave!” Despite my protests, he got into his car and drove off.\n\nI stood next to the door, dumbfounded, for a few moments. Then I slammed it shut. How could he just leave? After everything? I paced around for a while, considering what just happened. Once I was a little calmer, I wrote this out to see if anyone knows what this thing could be. Clearly my dad isn’t going to be very helpful and I need to know how to handle this. As I’m writing it out, I’m thinking of searching my parent’s room for answers. I’ll update if I find anything important.",

        "text": "### Chapter 1\n\nThis is how it happened on that Friday night. \n\nRene is a master's student at Uppsala University, Sweden and this is his first semester. His major is Human-Computer Interaction. \n\nYou know, Uppsala University is the oldest university in the whole Nordic region, full of stories and myths, history and reputation. \n\nFor every international master's student who enrols at Uppsala University, the university will arrange a corridor room for them. \n\nRene lives in a corridor with four other students: Marx Colwell, Sejin Kim, Sandra Moberg, and Shinichi Ozaki. \n\nThat night, Rene is writing his assignment, which is supposed to be handed in at 12:00 pm. \n\nUnfortunately, that is a Friday night, which also means that there usually is a party in a student corridor. \n\nI would like to describe that student corridor a bit: it is a big two-floor house. On the first floor, there is a big kitchen room and a big meeting room. On the second floor, there are their bedrooms. \n\nThe party is usually held on the first floor and the noise will always torture everyone on the second floor.\n\nNo one in this corridor loves to see a party held in the corridor except Marx Colwell, the UK guy.\n\nAs he says in the WhatsApp group, he is going to invite some people to have a party tonight. \n\nRene says a big NO in his heart and then does nothing but goes back to his assignment because there are only 6 hours left before the deadline and he only types two paragraphs. \n\nAt around 7 o’clock, Rene hears the noises of the crowd. No doubt it is from Marx and his party guys. \n\nThe noises became louder and louder and louder. At some moments, Rene swears that he must move out at the end of this semester. \n\nSimultaneously, Rene is struggling with the theory of ontology and epistemology regarding the HCI research methods. \n\nRene sits on his chair and starts to curse the teacher who made this boring and difficult assignment; he curses Marx, that male bitch, for holding this annoying party; he also curses the bad weather in Sweden for making him feel so disappointed. \n\nHe had no idea that the situation he curses now would be so cherished when looking back, and what is going to happen to him later on that night in this corridor is just the beginning of many horrible things that came along. \n\n### Chapter 2 \n\nRene is still working hard on his assignment but the sound from downstairs became even louder. \n\nHe feels exhausted and his Redbull has just run out, which means that he has to step out of the room, go downstairs to the refrigerator and grab another Redbull. \n\nBut, he does not want to. \n\nIt is uncomfortable for him to be exposed and watched in front of a crowd of strangers. \n\nBut on the other hand, he really needs a bottle of Redbull to gain some energy to finish his assignment. \n\nAfter struggling, he finally decides to go out of his room.\n\nThe moment Rene opens his door, there is a huge wave of music attacking him. \n\nIt sounds like a Spanish-Latin song: \n\n“Corazon de Melao, Corazon de Melao, Melao Melao Melao…”\n\nThe Spanish song had a strong beat which easily drives people to dance and move their bodies.\n\nNot surprisingly, downstairs there are some people grooving with the music. \n\nThey toss their hair like they are using their hair to grasp something in the air. \n\nRene goes to the refrigerator very quickly, opens it, grabs a Redbull, closes the door and returns to his room. \n\nHe sits on his chair, drinks Redbull, takes a long breath and puts his AirPods in his ear. \n\nThe music flows out, which is the acoustic version of the Cranberries’ song *Dreams*.\n\nRene really likes the acoustic version of this song because there’s no more extra accompaniment, which makes Dolores O'Riordan’s beautiful voice so vivid that he feels he could touch her silky shining voice so easily. \n\nIt is December now and the whole Nordic area is marching towards the polar night. \n\nHe gets out of his chair and opens the window and inhales the cold fresh air, trying to calm his wearied brain so that he can figure out a way to finish his assignment. \n\nThen he sees it: the northern light. \n\nThe air flows and shines as if it became flowing water; the wind blows and roars, bringing the breath of the void from very far away.\n\nWords could not be enough to describe the moment Rene sees the northern light. It is so damn beautiful that he just forgets all the bad things that happen today. \n\nSuddenly, Rene notices that the building just shakes. \n\nThe whole building shakes very slightly. \n\nSo slightly that he feels like it is like a soft sigh. \n\n### Chapter 3 \n\nRene finally manages to finish his assignment. Though he estimates that the teacher will definitely grade it as a D, at least he finishes it. \n\nRene hands in his homework to the student system and then he feels relaxed a bit. \n\nHe sits in his chair in a manner that he is paralysed. \n\nHis ear then catches the noises from downstairs. \n\nRene says distressedly,  “Oh, come on…I want my sleep tonight! I NEED to have a good rest tonight!”\n\nAfter thinking over and over again, he decides to ask those party guys to leave. \n\nThe moment he opens his door, however, he hears those people saying goodbye to each other and they are about to leave. \n\nThank God. \n\nRene feels relieved and then returns to his room. \n\nHe takes a shower, then lies on his bed and watches TikTok, preparing to sleep.\n\nHowever, when he is getting sleepy, he hears the noises again from downstairs. \n\nThe noises soon become louder and louder. \n\nThen, a message pops up on Rene’s phone. \n\nIt is the Korean girl Sejin Kim in the WhatsApp group: “WTF outside? Don’t they know it is 12 pm now? “\n\nJapanese guy Shinichi Ozaki replies: “Yeah, that’s rude and I am going to talk to them now.” \n\nThen Rene hears the sound of Shinichi’s opening the door and stepping downstairs. \n\nAfter 2 minutes, Shinichi updates the group: “ OMG, guys, you cannot believe what has happened outside…”\n\n“What do you mean?” Sandra Moberg responds quickly.\n\n“Those party guys go to the bus stop and find there is no bus. They wait for a long time but no bus comes. Besides, there is nothing on the street. Not even a person except themselves. There is no one in the supermarket, no one in our neighbourhood, Literally NO ONE…”\n\n“That’s normal, right? It’s at noon. Everybody is sleeping now and the supermarket is usually closed at 11:30 pm. I don’t believe them. They are just drunk and they want an excuse to go back and have fun.” Sandra responded. \n\n“They are not lying, Sandra. I can tell it. They are in a panic now. They must encounter something horrible.” Shinichi argues. \n\n“It’s too late now. Marx already let them sleep here tonight. We will discuss it tomorrow. “ Shinichi ends the discussion. \n\nAfter all, it is really late at night. \n\nRene has a very deep sleep and wakes up around 6:30 am. \n\nIt is still black outside the window. So he decides to have unprotected sleep, without a second thought about what happened last night. \n\nHowever, before long he is awakened by the sound of knocking on the door. \n\n“Rene, please come downstairs. Emergency! “ It is Sandra. Her voice sounds very anxious.\n\nRene says yes out loud. \n\nHe washes and rinses in about two minutes. Then he brings his phone and comes downstairs. \n\nAll people are already there, sitting or standing. \n\nRene sees Marx, Sandra, Sejin, Shinichi, and some other people whom he doesn’t know. \n\nThey must be Marx’s friends. They do look not good. \n\n“Something very serious must happen.”Rene thinks. \n\n“So Rene,” Sandra talks to Rene, “ Can you call your friend now? “\n\n“What? Why?” Rene feels confused. Everybody looks at him,\n\n“Just call a friend. Please.” Marx says to him. He looks really tired out. \n\nRene makes a phone call to his friend Leo. Leo does not answer it. \n\nEverybody then looks like “Yes, we already knew it.”\n\nRene makes another 5-6 phone calls, but no one answers him. \n\nHe even calls the police phone number, but no one answers him.\n\nHe calls the service line of the local hospital, but no one answers him. \n\nSuddenly, a horrible idea comes to his mind. \n\nHe recalls what Shinichi said last night: there was literally no one. \n\n“So what happened?!” Rene’s voice shivers. \n\n“Look, Rene,” Seijin says, “We could not connect anyone now because there is no one outside. NO ONE. And no cars, no bus on the street, We are ABANDONED.”\n\nRene knows every word said by Sejin, but he could not understand what she means. \n\n“We are abandoned?”\n\n“Yes, “ another girl Rene does not know continues, “ we have tried to contact every person we know, went out to find somebody in the neighbourhood to help us, to find a car or a bus to go home. But there was nothing we can reach out to. “\n\n“What?! our neighbourhood is also missing?” That’s unbelievable for Rene.\n\n“Unfortunately yes…it seems everything alive is missing…” that girl answered, “And you know what? when I come to the supermarket, I saw a cup of water with a tea bag on it. It seems someone just made it and then disappeared all of a sudden, leaving the a cup of tea there.”\n\nFrom everybody’s face, Rene knows it is clearly not a joke. \n\nThey are abandoned. \n\n### Chapter 4 \n\nDo you remember once there is a very popular TV series called *Lost*? \n\nA plane crashed on a desert island and everyone who survived the crash had to live by themselves.\n\nNo one could help them except themselves, because they were literally abandoned. \n\nRene and the other people in that house are now kind of in that situation. \n\nThey are hoping that someone can explain what is happening here. \n\nBut only silence speaks. \n\n“I got an idea!” A dude who wears a big moustache, “maybe it’s because they now have some kind of military action. They have to drive people away. But they forget to tell us…”\n\n“Who are THEY exactly?” Sandra asks further.\n\n“I don’t know, maybe it’s from the government or political parties…” that dude looks distressed.\n\n“That’s bullshit. They by no means forget us. We are not special.” Marx stops the dude’s talk.\n\n“What if we ARE special?” a french girl says, “ what if we are the target? Have you read the book *And Then There Were None*? We are trapped and everybody here is going to die one by one soon, for some reason we don't know.“ She says so firmly.\n\n“Stop, please stop, Amelie. You are freaking others out. “ another guy stops Amelie. \n\n“Fuck you, Jonas, it’s because of you that I came to this goddamn party. I didn’t want to!” Amelie responds angrily. \n\nShinichi looked very frightened.\n\n“There could be another possibility.” they turn to the man who is talking now. He is a Swedish man.\n\n“I have watched a movie, called The Others, starring Nicole Kidman. In that movie, a family moved to a new house. But they were disturbed by the ghost or something haunting that house. But finally, it turned out to be THEY are the ghost. They are the dead ones actually. So I think the reason that we could not find or contact anyone is that…\n\n“WE ARE ALREADY DEAD.”\n\n### Chapter 5\n\nSilence and fear fulfil the whole space. Everybody is lost inside. \n\nAs a 22-year-old young man, Rene never thought about death. \n\nRene thinks that he should do his best to avoid death because he has so many things to do in his life. \n\nHe does not want to die. \n\nBut what if he is already dead now? \n\nSo many faces pop up in his mind: his parents, his grandparents, and his friends. If he dies, will they miss him? \n\nAnd what about his dream? He always wants to become a UX designer at Google. That’s why he chooses to study HCI at Uppsala University. But now he is dead, and everything becomes meaningless. \n\nAnd by the way,  he is a dead virgin. He even does not have sex with anybody, boy or girl. \n\nHis brain echoes T.S. Eliot’s poetry *The Waste Land*. \n\n“*December is the cruellest month, breeding* \n\n*desperation out of the dead land, mixing*\n\n*coldness and sorrow, stirring*\n\n*peace and quietness with endless impermanence,* “\n\nRene thinks, all is meaningless, life is meaningless. \n\n“Life is fucking meaningless.” a chic and handsome guy screams out, “ I should’ve fuck more girls when I was alive. Now I am dead? Who wanna have an orgy party now? I have some weed. Or if you want some meth, I could also do it…”\n\n“Shut the fuck up, Jonas.” the french girl seems to be extremely angry with this chic man. \n\n“Stop!” Sandra becomes very serious, “ I believe we ARE not dead. I can feel my heartbeat and I do have a pulse, which means my blood is still transmitted through my body and my organs are still working to support my life. “\n\nThen she turns to that Swedish guy Jonas and says:” Stop frightening us. This is not funny.”\n\n“There must be something wrong,” Sandra says. \n\nSandra’s words calm them down. Yet, then here comes another question: what the fuck is wrong?\n\nIf you ask Rene to describe their situation with five keywords, he will say people, house, isolation, strange, and horror. \n\nThat’s the facts regarding their situation. \n\nBut, unfortunately, he, or they, ignores the most important keyword because of fear, which leads them to the very wrong path in this situation. \n\n### Chapter 6\n\nWe are human and we know things. Our knowledge is developed based on our observation, our direct feeling, and other people’s experiences or knowledge. \n\nBut even so, we could not know everything and explain everything, for example, what caused their situation. \n\nThey all give up explaining what is happening in their Embla house. \n\nTheir house is called Embla, which is the name of a Goddess from Nordic myths.\n\nInstead, they focus on what they should do next. \n\nThere are two different opinions: 1) stay at the house altogether and see what would happen. This opinion is based on the assumption that they must face something horrible. So it would be better if they could face it together; 2) everybody just goes back to their own home but stay in touch by phone numbers. \n\nThe invited-to-party people are supporters of the second opinion. They are exhausted and all they want is to go home.\n\n“Here’s the problem: how would you find a vehicle to go home? There’s even no bicycle outside.” Marx says.\n\n“Marx is right. I don’t think you can walk home. We are very far away from the city. “ Sandra adds. \n\nFinally, they reach a trade-off agreement: all the people stay at the house until they could find a vehicle or someone to help them. \n\nHere, it would be better to introduce a bit about the people in this house, here are the following people:\n\n1. Sandra\n2. Rene\n3. Marx\n4. Shinichi\n5. Seijin\n\nthese five people live in this house.\n\n1. Jonas, the chic guy\n2. August, the Swedish man\n3. Amelie, the french girl\n4. Rodi, a guy with a big moustache, \n5. Sonja, a girl who looked like an Indian, but actually is from Denmark.\n\nThose five people are visitors. \n\nThey decide that Jonas live with Marx, Amelie live with Sandra, Sonja live with Sejin, Rodi with Shinichi and August with Rene.\n\n“Now everybody,” says Sandra, “please have some rest. We have had enough today.”\n\nSuddenly, Shinichi says, “Oh shit, I forget! Today there is an Esports competition. “\n\nLooking at Shinichi, something comes to Rene’s mind and he shouts:” Internet! we can use the Internet to ask for HELP! How can we be so stupid to forget this way?” \n\n“I have tried. “ August says calmly, “I have tried to search BBC, CNN, the local news, Facebook, and TikTok, but all the posts stopped at 11:22 pm yesterday. I even tried to search on China’s most popular social media Weibo, you guess what, all the posts in China also stopped at 11:22 pm. ”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Why 11:22 pm?” Amelie asks.\n\nNo one knows. \n\nRene feels so frustrated. The bubble of hope bursts. \n\nWhat happened all over the world? Where was anybody else? Why they were left here in this Embla house? \n\nRene cannot help thinking those questions.\n\nAmelie tries to analyze the situation:” Do you think it has something to do with this house? Everyone was erased from the earth except us. Because we are in this house! There must be something wrong with this house.”\n\nEverybody realises her opinion is constructive. \n\nAugust’s eyes shine and his face looked like “I cannot agree with you anymore.”\n\n“What you said reminds me of Feng Shui.” Shinichi says, “ It’s a term from China, which is about the theory of house place. According to Feng Shui, the geographical place of a house has a strong impact on the people who live in it. ”\n\nSandra seems to be really confused about Feng Shui, but she continues: “ I think maybe we should also try to figure out what actually happened before 11:22 pm. Or did any of you notice something unusual yesterday ?”\n\n“The northern light.” Seijin says, “ Yesterday, there was a northern light. I saw it from my window.”\n\n“Well, in Sweden, northern light is quite usual in December.” Sandra shrugs her shoulders.\n\n“On my god.” Rodi, the big moustache guy says: “I just found the northern light happened exactly at 11:22 pm yesterday.”\n\n“Great! Now we are putting the pieces together into a picture. We now know two important facts: the house has something to do with our situation and the northern light happened at 11:22 pm yesterday.” August was really excited about the progress they made. \n\nEverybody seems to be more relieved and has a feeling that we are getting closer to the truth with their analysis skills.\n\nHowever, it turns out to be totally wrong. \n\nThey actually even do not touch the edge of the horrible truth at that moment. \n\nBecause what happens next is far beyond their imagination. \n\n### Chapter 7\n\nThey decide to have some rest.\n\nMarx and Jonas bring some groceries from the supermarket nearby. Of course, they do not need to pay. \n\nThey even bring some good wine from the local store. \n\nThey make a very luxurious dinner, as compensation for this bizarre and horrible situation.\n\nAlthough the situation seems not bad, they do not try to be too anxious. \n\nAs it said when you encounter the cliff along your road, why don’t you just stop and enjoy the view?\n\nAfter dinner, they go back to their own room.\n\nAugust is arranged to live with Rene. But he comes back to the room very late.\n\nRene is playing games when August goes back. \n\nWhen there are just Rene and August in that room, he realises that August is somehow very sexual. He is not a handsome guy but Rene can tell he has something called sexual tension.\n\nWhen August sees Rene, he says directly:” I just had sex with Jonas. I was the top and we had bareback sex. ”\n\nWhat?\n\nHe continues, “Yes. Part of me thought he was right. Maybe we will die tomorrow. I need sex to feel that I am alive. By the way, Jonas has a prostate orgasm.”\n\nThen he is going to take a shower, leaving a messy Rene in the air. \n\nMaybe it’s called Doomsday Manic.\n\nBut it’s not funny. \n\n“I do not want to die. This situation means that I might not see my parents, my friends, or other ones that I love forever.”\n\nThat’s not funny, Rene thinks. \n\nRene is now haunted by heavy emotion and walks to the window. \n\nHe opens the window.\n\nA cold wind blows in and the curtain goes up and down, like a soft sigh. \n\nAll Rene could see is darkness. \n\nEndless darkness. No northern light tonight. \n\nThe cold fresh air makes him feel desolate and bereft.\n\nSuddenly, he sees someone outside the window under the street light, very far away, but very clearly. \n\nThere is a strange guy standing outside there.\n\nHe should have felt very happy because he sees someone else which meant, they are not abandoned alone. \n\nBut actually, Rene feels uncomfortable because there is no face on that guy’s head, and all of this guy, from head to body looks all black like he wears Balenciaga.\n\nRene is terribly frightened. \n\n### Chapter 8\n\nDo you know in Japanese animation there is a no-face female Yokai, whose face is totally blank like her face is erased by someone?\n\nNow Rene sees a guy whose face is blank and black. \n\nRene opens his mouth and wants to ask August to come and see.\n\nBut all of a sudden, that guy disappears like smoke dissolves in the air.\n\nLike he did not show up in front of Rene.\n\nRene just realises how stupid he is: how could he forget to take a picture?\n\nEverything now he has experienced  is just too ridiculous, too surreal, and too absurd.\n\nRene decides not to share this experience with anyone else. \n\nFor now, he just wants to have some rest. \n\nRene sleeps on his bed and August slept on the ground. Rene could hear him snoring. \n\nRene could not help thinking about what has happened in just one day:\n\nThe annoying party, all other people have vanished except them, the guy just showed up in front of his window. \n\nThese things lingered in the back of his brain while Rene is sleeping on the bed.\n\nBut he could not figure out what caused this situation. \n\nEverything is just so absurd. \n\nRene couldn’t fall asleep until 3 am. \n\nWhen Rene gets up, it is late in the morning.\n\nAugust is already not there. \n\nRene guesses August went downstairs.\n\nRene surfs the internet and checks whether there are new updates on the Internet. Sadly no.\n\nThe world does not reset to normal. They are still in this weird situation. \n\nRene thinks about his situation, he has a thought: when you encountered the cliff, why don’t you just stop and enjoy the sightseeing?\n\nLife is absurd, just take it as it is and have fun. Maybe that is the right attitude.\n\nRene takes a deep breath and he decides not to look bad.\n\nHe goes downstairs and sees everybody is there.\n\nThey seem to get used to this situation: some are playing Esports, some are watching TV series, some are listening to music and emerging themselves in another world, and some, however, if Rene is right, are watching porn. \n\nLife moves on even in this bizarre situation. \n\nSuddenly, their phone rings simultaneously. \n\nThat is a number they do not know. Who is going to call them now? \n\nThe man that wears Balenciaga comes to Rene’s mind. \n\nRene answers the phone and says:” Hello?” \n\n### Chapter 9\n\nWhen Rene was younger, he had tried a kind of virtual sex via telephone. \n\nThe voice from the other side of the phone becomes a very important source of sexual material that turn Rene on. \n\nThat was a female’s voice, sweet and cute.\n\nRene can’t help but think, that maybe that woman is a strict teacher, a serious doctor, somebody’s girlfriend or wife, someone’s mother.\n\nBut now, her voice was “having” sex with Rene’s body. \n\nVoice, from the other side of the phone, has made Rene jerk off. \n\nRene answers the phone and says:” Hello?”, very casually.\n\nHowever, there is no one speaking in it. \n\nRene looks at everyone else. \n\nThey check with each other and confirm that they received the same phone call from the same number at the same time.\n\nAnd August says:” Ah, it seems that we received the same phone call. Let’s turn on the speakers.”\n\nEverybody holds their phones and turns on the speakers. \n\nBut no one speaks in it. \n\nSejin finds something strange and says: “that’s impossible that so many people receive the phone call at the same time. You cannot call many people at the same time with the same phone number.”\n\n“Haha, another supernatural thing.” Jonas looks really excited. \n\nAfter a while, there is a strange sound from our speakers. That is a sound with a strange rhythm. \n\n“Di-da, dI-da, di-Da, di-dA, di-di-di, da-da-da, da-di, da-di,da-di”\n\n“That sounds like a water drop,” Amelie says, calmly, like she is now in front of a lake with gently falling rain.\n\nThen, the sound changes.\n\nNow it sounds like two pieces of glass cracked on each other. \n\n“Tick, tick, tick,...tick, tick, tick…”\n\nEverybody holds on to their breath and focuses on listening, sparkles shining in their eyes.\n\nNow the sound changes again. It sounds like dumplings are poured into water.\n\n“Padam, Padam, Padam…”\n\nSuddenly, the sound becomes much louder, and now it sounds like somebody chokes their throat and squashes their throat to make a sound.\n\n“Ewww. Ewwwww, Eww, Ewww, Ewwwww, Eww…”\n\nThen the sound becomes even louder. Now it sounds like a mental can is ticked by someone.\n\n“tik-tok, tik-tok, tik-tok…”\n\nRodi suddenly opens his eyes and moves his body with the rhythm.\n\nJonas sees that, and gets some inspiration, starts a free-form jazz improvisation. \n\nEverybody starts to groove with Jonas’ humming.\n\nAfter about one minute, then everything is stopped in the speaker.\n\nThe phone call is hung up.",

        "text": "The first thing I want to share with all of you happened when I was about 12 years old..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo help you understand and sort of set the scene for you, I need to walk you through the layout of my neighborhood. It wasn't any different than any other neighborhood in America. But there were some particular landmarks and areas within that are important to the story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lived on 18th street. It was the last street in the neighborhood, you could go no farther. If you walked out of my front door and made your way across the street, you would pass my neighbors homes across the road. Behind their properties was an expansive chunk of forest that we spent a ton of time in as kids. We knew those woods like the back of our own hands so to speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was born in '86. So my childhood consisted of a lot of Nintendo 64 and a ton of time outdoors. Technology wasn't what it is now. We had a family computer, and it was equipped with the internet through AOL. Back then when you got online it would tie up your home phone line. So anytime you were on the internet you could get or make phone calls, people would just get a busy signal if they tried to call. One of my most nostalgic memories of the internet back then was signing on. Your computer would make a cacophony of noises and you would be met with the standard AOL greeting. Welcome. You've got mail. I still love to memory of that to this day even though it was quite annoying to be honest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 13, I wanted a beeper so badly, but my grandmother would not allow it. I even spent my allowance at the mall beeper stand, to buy a black Nike branded beeper case. I never got the beeper that went in it though. She claimed they were for drug dealers or some craziness along those lines. She got me every other machine I could possibly want though. I always had the newest video game consoles and games. I even got her hooked on Crash Bandicoot and Final Fantasy. She was also fond of Bubsy and Dr. Mario.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe got me a word processor for Christmas one year. I used to set up on that thing staring at the screen, with it's orange colored font, writing story after story, through the wee hours of the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, the woods were great. We manifested every kind of grand adventure a child's imagination could possibly fathom or dream of in those woods. We took our girlfriends on walks through them, when we were old enough to start having love interests anyway. We even had a huge rock we would take them to, we all affectionately liked to call, The Kissing Rock. The woods extended ar away from the neighborhood and we knew every inch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of our favorite past times in the summer was to trek deep into the far western side of the woods. Where there was an old abandoned stone quarry that was hidden in the forest. When that quarry was active it would have been visible from the road like the one across the other side of that particular road was. The new quarry pit and company marked the end of the woods for the most part on that end. But the older pit across the way had been taken back by nature. It almost seemed hidden or secreted away. Every kid in town that knew about it and was within walking or riding distance, would sneak back there every other day of the summer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere had been many bad accidents back there. It was a massive whole in the earth, and it was filled in with water. but the water level stopped short of the rim. Depending on where around the rim you were standing the rock rim just became cliffs. The highest point we would jump from was an area we called, Dead Man's Drop, or just Dead Man's for short. That jump was probably a good 60 to 80 feet. One side we called, The Triangle, had some great 30 and 40 foot jumps, and a lot of exposed rock that was vegetation free. That was where kids would just hang out or build fires at sundown.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll get to the rest of the woods some other time. There is so much about them, and so many times they were the source of our fun, and fear. Countless creepy experiences happened to us all the time back there. Braving them at night was a completely different experience altogether. Between the local urban legends and stories, and just the general spookiness that comes with a forest at night. You would freeze in your tracks at the hoot of an owl, or the snapping of a branch. We would sometimes build fires and tell creepy stories around the fire at night. We would party back there too when we got a bit older.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, now that you have general picture of the area. I want to take you back to 1998. A year earlier the Phoenix Lights had been national news. The Heaven's Gate cult committed their atrocity in a mansion in California. Princess Diana died in a horrible car crash in Paris. Mars Pathfinder landed on the surface of Mars. The first signs of the dreaded Bird Flu in China where the first documented case of the jump to humans causes Hong Kong to kill 1.25 million chickens. The first successfully cloned mammal is revealed by the Roslin Institute. It is revealed to be a 7 month old sheep, it's named Dolly. And the first book in the award winning Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling is published, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say it was a strange year leading up to the summer of 1998. It was one of those nights where it's warm and still, and the sky is alive. Heat lightning pulsed through the clouds and it felt like it  could of been storming if the conditions were slightly different. It was about 10:30 at night, and a handful of kids hung out under the street light on the corner. I'm sure a few creative ways to share new curse words were shared. General child-like chaos that comes with the absence of an adult presence ensued. I couldn't tell you everything we did that night while we hung out on our darkened street. But that is where it happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMid-sentence the quiet night air exploded around us. The sound of the explosion was so loud that you felt it in your bones. It vibrated you to your core and drove us like a herd of cattle stampeding away from danger. The instant the explosion happened we were robbed of our sight and thrust into a darkness that was like being in the dark expanse of space. As far as the eye could see we were robbed of our sense of safety, robbed of the light. Even the porch lights on all the houses had went. It was a complete blackout of the power grid on our side of town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so terrified I ran shakily back to my house. It felt as though I levitated there in slow motion. Flanked on either side by my little brother, my best friend, and a couple other kids. We ran for our lives, we genuinely felt a primal level of fear set in with that explosion. After gathering back our wits and regrouping mentally. And after making sure we all still had ten fingers and ten toes. We began to slowly make our way back outside and into the road. Braving the darkness to try and get a feel for what had just happened to us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know who noticed the next thing first, but an incredible sight lay before us. Out there across the road, looking all the way back to the tree line of those black woods. About 8 to 10 feet high up in the tree line was what looked like a window. A window in the woods. Lit by an internal fire, it glowed a vibrant amber color. What was terrifying about that image was that it was unobstructed. Not a single branch of a tree or anything at all for that matter, obstructed the window. If it even was a window. Matter a fact I know it wasn't a window, like I said before, we knew those woods better than our bedrooms. And there were no structures back there.  Not in that area and not for miles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day we went back there to look around and we couldn't find anything that suggested that anything weird had ever happened there at all. That next night the street lights were back on, and the window in the woods was back too. It returned nightly for over a week that summer. And for that week of the summer we exhausted all the possibilities, we explored and figured until our minds gave up and just accepted the fact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I had answers to what happened back then.  But I doubt I will ever know what truly caused the high strangeness of that terrifying week during the summer of 1998. Next time I will tell you about the time we had a kid from the area go missing for eight days. And how that led to us suspecting one of our long time neighbors of being a serial killer. And how that led to one of the worst winters of my life. Thank you for listening, keep your eyes peeled, and never make the mistake of thinking you know everything about something so familiar. Because sometimes strange things happen, and sometimes something so familiar to you, can be absolutely terrifying.",

        "text": "Joan and I, all we ever wanted were to have a kid. We tried for years. We’ve been together for more than 39 years. 39 years… imagine that, and we still can’t manage to have one. We prayed so hard, hoping that He could hear our prayers. Sadly, we withered and grew tired, but we still love each other no matter what.\n\nYou see, we live in a tiny town now. We tend to move a lot when we’re young. She was a primary school teacher before. She was at the school playground watching her students play when I first saw her. I was a cook in the school canteen. Joan, with her curly, long, auburn hair. Her gorgeous smile. That enticing eyes. I just fell in love with her right then and there. I took a short break at the tree where I parked my car. I was looking at her and she looked back at me. Not a short while after, everything felt magical. We had been together for 8 months at that time when I asked her to marry me. We married and had our honeymoon.\n\nWe’ve been happily married for 1 year and 4 months when something truly horrifying happened. A child went missing. A very young child. She was 5 years old. She’s one of Joan’s pupils. Her name is Bree. The whole town tried looking for her. The search went on for days. It’s truly heartbreaking to watch the child’s parents when the authorities can’t do anything to find their child. Even Joan was upset that someone took the child. She thought of her pupils as her kids.\n\nNot long after that, another kid went missing. His name is Luke. He’s 7 years old and also was Joan’s former pupil. This time, there was a search party. Even the nearby town’s authorities offered to help. This time, Luke’s parents were quite rich. They owned some real estate here and in nearby towns. Aside from the huge amount of money as a reward for finding Luke, the father also employed a private investigator and additional men to help find their son.\n\nThere was no suspect or any leads for the missing kids. It’s like they’re gone instantly. No trace of anything and no evidence. This was way before any kind of technology or any equipment that suppose to help find clues and evidence.\n\nThese incidents stressed Joan so much she can’t sleep or eat. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night without her beside me. She wasn’t in the mood to do anything. I can see that she’s faking her smile when she’s at school. Even with our usual talks and activities at night, she didn’t feel like doing it anymore.\n\nI sensed at that time that I should do something about it. I can’t bear witnessing her do this to herself. It took a long time but I eventually convinced her to move out of town and go somewhere else. We liked small towns. We still do. That’s why we moved into another small town in a different state. The environment seems peaceful. She really loves children, so she applied for a job as a primary school teacher and also as a part-time social worker. She’s very active in the community that everyone loves her. She felt that this small town was our home now.\n\nAs nightmares follow you wherever you go, ours did as well. We were living there for almost 3 years when a kid was taken. His name was Charles. He was a very sweet kid, especially to my wife, Joan. There was a wide search &amp; rescue. We joined as well. Joan urged me to participate. It took us the whole afternoon and evening to comb every inch of the town and the forest as well. It took us 4 days and nights when eventually the authorities called it off.\n\nJoan was so sad because of that but I assured her that eventually, everything would turn out okay. We still can’t manage to have kids and Joan didn’t like the idea of adopting. Her view on that was that she was taking care of lots of children already and taking care of them feels like what adoption seems like. I didn’t try to debate it, but from time to time, we really try to have one for ourselves. \n\nJust a few days before the anniversary of Charle’s disappearance when another kid was taken. Her name was Jessica. She was the mayor’s kid. This one was huge. There are media everywhere. Everyone tried to look for her. The detectives were trying to investigate for clues and evidence. The mayor really tried in his power to find his Jessica. \n\nThis incident really broke Joan’s heart as well. She was close with the mayor’s family and she loves Jessica. It seems to me like she’s losing it again. She spent some time in the basement now. She’s not eating and talking.\n\nWe were dumbfounded when, a couple of weeks after Jessica’s disappearance, the police released a list of suspects in both Charles and Jessica’s disappearance. The first one on their list was a well-known sexual predator and pedophile that lives near our town. Some other suspects that I weren’t familiar with or even heard of but they’re there based on the evidence found. The last person on their suspect list was Joan. Apparently, when the news broke out about Jessica’s disappearance. The detectives from the previous town we lived in heard that as well and contacted this town’s detectives. They connect some dots, especially the part where Joan was very close with the kids.\n\nJoan didn’t take that news very well. Some people avoided her. Some people were accusing her of doing it. She seldomly ate. She’s always in the basement now. That’s why I brought her food down there. She just went up to take a bath or to accept interviews from the police to prove her innocence. Seeing her torture herself like that. I can’t take it anymore. I love her so much. I wanted my old Joan back. I want to see her smile again. I feel like had to do something.\n\nDays after, we received news that they apprehended Henry. The sexual predator and pedophile. Headless bodies of Charles and Jessica were buried a few hundred yards near where he lived and within the forest. Evidence was pointing that Henry did it. Joan was relieved that she was not the suspect now that Henry was behind bars.\n\nEventually, we had to move away again so Joan could heal fully. She can’t live with that kind of sadness. We didn’t move within the small town, but near it, so we can have the peace and quiet of living together alone and also away from the madness that even the small town people can do to you. We bought a small farm and settled on it. That’s where we decided we live until we grew old. It didn’t matter now if we can’t have children. She loves staying in the barn. She’s always there even now that I’m writing this. Even if she looks old and thin now, she’s still beautiful as she was when I first saw her. It’s almost midnight yet she hasn’t come out of the barn. That’s alright with me. She’s happy in there, sitting in one of the stalls. Surrounded by the kids she loved. In her left arm lay Charle’s and Jessica’s heads. While Luke and Bree are by her side. They look so thin and boney right now. Yet they make Joan so happy and delighted.  \n\n\n[Link](https://www.tumblr.com/hobgoblins-world/705307914586472448)",

        "text": "I don't know how much longer I can sit here and pretend to be okay, I can barely keep a straight face. I should probably give some context, not that I can do much else than stay on my phone right now. I had to pick my little brother up on the way home from school as my mum works evenings. So, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary at first when I got home. The house was messy as usual, I didn't even see my mum's phone under all her crafting supplies, she's probably one of the most disorganised organised people I know. I knew the routine, I'm sixteen feeling like I'm forty sometimes...Still, I made us both some food which just was some tabbed leftovers of pasta bake and chucking it in the microwave. Tommy, my brother, didn't like it much but I was tired and exams were wearing me down. \n\nPersonally dealing with a five-year-old wasn't the way I wanted to spend my evening but I can now say that that would be a dream compared to what was happening now. I got home at four, ate at five and planned on trying to settle Tommy but when he went to use the bathroom he spent way too long up there and I found him crying, I tried to settle him but it took over an hour and he just kept saying he saw something. And this was a kid who watched Chucky religiously. Honestly, seeing him so shaken almost made me not want to go upstairs at all. We moved in here about two months ago but we weren't new to the area, I hadn't heard any weird stories about the house so I never suspected anything. But I should have guessed something was wrong when my cat ran away and no matter how many times we brought him back he seemed distressed and ran away. \n\nBut I'm sitting in the living room with Tommy finally asleep on top of me. The TV was playing some rerun of a daytime show and I can barely think. I'm just trying to focus on writing this so sorry for all the rambling. I'm just scared that if I stop writing that it'll know that I know it's there. All evening I have seen things out of the corner of my eye, banging noises but I had assumed it was Tommy. But then I heard the groaning, gurgling, sorrowful moans and cries. It sounded so far away that I barely noticed it but at times it was also so loud. I don't know where it is. Or what it is. But I can hear it now. Slow, almost squeaking groans that occasionally utter my name. My mum should have been back by now but her phone went off earlier and she wouldn't leave without it. I'm starting to worry that she never managed to leave the house. \n\nThere's a rotten smell that I'll catch every now and then, taps on the window and the floorboards will creak. What the hell is in here with me? Everything in me is telling me to be silent and still. I'm too scared to move. \n\nUpdate...the TV just automatically turned off and now I'm sitting in silence but that's not the worst part. Not even slightly. I sort of glanced up while keeping my head down and something was standing behind me. It sounds so far away but it's right behind me. I don't know what to do. I don't think it knows that I've seen it. It keeps calling my name but it doesn't sound right. I'm praying Tommy doesn't wake up. I know I can't run. What do I do? Just sit here...wait? The smell makes me want to gag, I'm on the verge of tears. \n\nUpdate two...I think I passed out in fear or something, I don't know. I've looked around and I'm alone with Tommy but I'm pretty sure it's still here somewhere. It's past midnight and there's no sign of my mum. I don't want it to know that I've noticed it and I don't have anyone else to go to or a place to stay other than my house. I'm going to head to bed with Tommy with me. I don't know what else to do anymore. I'm hoping I'll wake up in the morning and it'll all be back to normal. Wish me luck.",

But before anything I’ll give you some backstory to how I’m in the position that I’m in.\n\nRural life isn’t as serene as people might hope. The escape to the country was always posted as some sort of American dream, but there’s something very unknown about the country. Miles and miles of forest, more woodland than settlements. Lakes so immense you’d think you were at the coast. It doesn’t feel like our own. It feels alienating. And maybe, our instincts, the only thing that has led us here today, aren’t too far away with that feeling. Nature isn’t where we are to meant to be met with comfort. That’s why humans have done whatever we can to stray away from it. Villages wasn’t enough, towns wasn’t enough- CITIES wasn’t enough, we know we aren’t welcome in nature. We try to flush it out. Trees into apartments, fields into basketball courts, we make whatever we can to feel like the primary residents in our small world but we won’t ever achieve it.

There’s a lot to consider on how you’ll come into contact with these things, mainly based on where you live and your families history. If your oblivious to them it lowers the chance even more, they thrive off of belief, if you don’t pay any mind to them it’s harder for them poke a hole into your reality. And there may have even been times where you’ve come into contact with them and not known, they aren’t all ravenous, and some have appearances indifferent to us. There are a plethora of reasons as to why you might have never seen any of these creatures, but always remember even if you have all of these things in your favour the chances are never 0%. \n\nWhen it comes to understanding the supernatural one of the first shocks, is that some these classic little gimmicks which you’d expect to hold no significance, does indeed hold value. Numbers like 3, 7 or 13 different charms and repellents and types of foreshadowing all hold weight when we deal with supernatural entities.

No matter how high it flys you hear the shrieks, I’m not sure if it’s in constant pain, i feel as if it’s on the brink of decomposition but refuses to cross the line.

It was insanely hard for my to cope with the reality that I would never be viewed as ‘normal’ while trying to be what my parents wanted for me- a straight Christian girl. Believe me, I tried to fulfill their wishes, but I realized the hard way that I would never be the daughter they wanted. \n\nCut to freshman year in high school, when I started fantasizing a perfect relationship. One where I could just be myself and stop having to pretend that I was something I wasn’t with somebody I loved. Being genuinely loved felt so distant to me. I felt so consumed by all the pressure to be who my parents wanted me to be that I began daydreaming of a girl that would take me away from all of it. The one to save me. My savior. I did everything I could to make her real. She was mine.  \n\nHer name was Lilah, she was about 5’10 with a slim build and dark grey eyes that brought out her summertime freckles, and skin kissed by the sun. She was everything I could’ve ever wanted. She was the one thing in my life that stayed  constant, while everything around me fell I bits, I had the husk of a dream that was slowly dying inside me. She was my escape from the world. She meant everything to me for a long long time. \n\nThis all changed when I finally stopped caring about what my parents said,  got the courage to begin coming out to friends and colleagues when I got into college. I even was able to get myself a girlfriend. A real girlfriend, Katherine. We’ve been living happily together for about 6 months. \n\nCut to yesterday when my girlfriend had left for work, and I was sleeping in that morning since I was off.\n\nIt was about 8:15 am when I woke up to an incessant knocking on my door, I flung the door open to see who the hell was ferociously knocking, and I felt my heart stop. It was her. It have been. I know what I saw.\n\n“ WHAT THE FUCK LILA-“ I cursed before I felt Lilah’s hand over my mouth shutting me up before I could get anything else out. \n\n“ Get inside the house. I need to tell you something”, she whispered, gripping my hand with a strength that compelled me to follow her. \n\nLilah sat down on the couch, I stared at her completely befuddled as to how this happened. Was I dreaming? Was I drunk? What was happening to me? How is this possible? \n\n“ I can’t stay long, but I must disenchant you of  your fantasy. None of this is right. You know what you’ve done. Lilah mumbled a mixture of fury and sadness danced across her face. \n\nI locked eyes with the figure, her eyes… they weren’t the same. I knew they weren’t. I would’ve known. My Lilah’s eyes were as dark as the night I dug her up in. I knew this… thing couldn’t be her, my Lilah had scars from where I stitched her up and put her together after dragging her out of her grave. \n\nThe thing stood up and twisted its face into an uncanny smile. It reverted back to the state that it was when I lived with it, starting with its  grey orbs. “ Did you miss me, baby?”, it cackled.\n\nI made a mad dash to the bathroom and I’ve been there since then. I don’t know how it managed to get out of that grave once I put it back, but I know that thing is getting closer to getting into the bathroom… and putting this down is the only way I can begin to comprehend the situation. I’ll update you guys if anything else happens. I can hear its screams getting closer.",

        "text": "If you're about to light one or planning to, stop. Keep them away, stay indoors, because even if you don't light one, it can still find you.\n\nAt first when I heard about the warning on my phone, I didn't really care about the warning. Maybe it's because they can be dangerous, and some people use them recklessly.\n\nI planned on staring out my shitty apartment window and watch all the fireworks light up, since obviously people wouldn't listen. Some people wouldn't want to actually listen after all.\n\nAnd sure enough, I saw fireworks launching up and promptly exploding into fabulous colors. I gazed in awe. Actually I didn't notice the buzzing from my phone at first, which I picked up and saw another warning message.\n\n\"WARNING! This is not a test, this is an official warning from the EMBC. A being of unknown origin is on our planet. We advise you all to stay inside, turn off all lights, lock everything, stay in a room that can be locked AND has no windows, and do not light any fireworks. May god help us all.\"\n\nMy hand was shaking. A being of unknown origin, an alien probably, this was just so unbelievable. My apartment had no blinds, but my bathroom was the safest place, so I ran there immediately, swiftly locking the door.\n\nI pulled up my phone and immediately started messaging my family. I was going to come over later in the night to hangout. At this point I was praying to God they didn't light any fireworks.\n\nNo one even responded, just left on delivered after ten minutes. I honestly had no hope of them being alive at this point.\n\nI spoke to myself in disbelief, \"This can't be happening, no this can't this is a joke,\" I quietly sobbed, wrapping my arms around my legs in a corner.\n\nThrough my thin and crappy walls, I heard yells from outside, screams of pain and agony. Even when I covered my ears the noises remained the same volume.\n \nAnother issue rang out from my phone.\n\n\"DO NOT OPEN ANY DOORS. DO NOT LET ANYBODY IN. THAT'S NOT YOUR FRIEND. THAT'S NOT YOUR FAMILY.\"\n\nI'm losing it, I couldn't really handle this stress as I hyperventilate.\n\nI actually thought the message seemed more like it was letting me know that it was going to happen. Because I heard knocks almost immediately afterwards.\n\nBut it was close, it wasn't the front door. The knocks were coming from the bathroom door.\n\nI struggled to breathe, my head kept seeming to spin. No speaking came from the door, just rapid pounding, and the screams from everyone seemed to just get louder.\n\nStruggling to get up, I grabbed the container of pills left on my bathroom sink, and then I downed a singular pill. The pounding slowly faded as I presumed it left, and I fell asleep in my own bathroom.\n\nWhen I woke up, there was no screams, and my phone buzzed immediately, it knew when I was going to wake up.\n\n\"To all survivors, please, go outside and light some fireworks, we need to be able to find you, whoever is left. Thanks.\"\n\nI shook my head, that's bullshit. That must be the beings, it's the aliens. They want to find us, they want to find the remaining people left alive.\n\nSo to anyone still left, don't light any fireworks. You can't trust the EMBC, you can't trust the news, don't even trust your friends.\n\nMy mom and dad keep messaging me but I know they died, the monster's got them, I already blocked them both.\n\nI'm begging you, stay safe, don't light any fireworks.",

        "text": "\"Hey, you wanna dance, Kat?\" I looked in the direction I thought her voice was coming from. Jenna was smiling at me. Crooning to me. God, I'd wanted this chance for fucking *years.*\n\n\"Y-Yeah...\" I straightened up and then with a little more confidence shouted, \"Hell yeah!\" I got up and walked over to her, putting on the color-coded headphones. I took her hand and she led me out to the middle of the dance floor. There, I gave a thumbs-up to the designated DJ to crank our music up. We got the blue DJ, the good one, so me, her, and about 3 other people were shaking and rocking out to Combichrist and a few other technometal artists while everyone else were listening to God only knew, or cared, what.\n\n30 seconds. Half a minute. That's how long my little taste of heaven lasted.\n\nAbout 10 seconds after, I remember hearing a faint screaming noise. Actually, *multiple* screams would be accurate. Still, faint being the key word, which meant I easily swept it off to keep dancing with Jenna. That lasted *almost* another 15 seconds before I noticed that everyone stopped dancing. Everyone was now looking toward the back of the dance room toward the hall. The music was still playing in the headphones, so I took them off to immediately be met with screams and gasps and \\*\"Oh my God\"\\*s.\n\nJenna had taken hers off now at this point and I looked at her. I was about to ask if she knew anything about what the hell was going on, but the bewildered look on her face took care of that for me. She was craning her neck to look out and over the throng of people to see the hallway. I did the same, with no luck from me either. Jenna started moving closer to the crowd. I tried staying behind her, but we were quickly separated only about a quarter of the way through the crowd.\n\nTrying to wade through the crowd was like trying to wade through an audience at a rock concert, maybe even made all the worse here because of the apparent hysteria. \"J-Jenna!\" I called out, trying desperately to spot her again. I couldn't see her anywhere.\n\nA little way further through the crowd, I heard one of the girls up ahead shriek at the top of their lungs, damn near killing me right then and there of a heart attack. Right then, I was stuck between just freezing up where I was and wanting to push and fight my way further through the crowd. I was terrified of what I'd find ahead, but more so of course about what might've happened to Jenna. With that, I ended up electing the latter -- something *far* easier said than done.\n\nBy luck or sheer willpower though, I actually managed to get myself close enough to the front of the crowd to start seeing what was going on. I couldn't see much, with a lot of the taller people there standing right at the front, but I could see that someone was on the ground, twitching and twisting spasmodically. Heart racing, I manage to spot Jenna just to my right and I go to her. \"What's going on, who is that?\"\n\nHer head snapped suddenly to me, wide and startled, before exchanging glances between me and the person on the ground ahead. \"I... I-I don't know...\" Our gaze returned to the guy on the floor. I could hear choked sort of gurgling noises, almost like he was trying to talk, but was being choked while doing so. He had one hand clawing at his throat with the other clawing his eyes, so much so I could faintly see streams of blood running down his face.\n\n\"Oh my God, I think he's choking!\" I cried. No one moved. \"Here, move.\" I violently shoved my way past the two gorillas in front of me to rush to the guy's side. As bad as he was flopping around on the ground, I had a hell of a time trying to lift him up to a sitting position so I could try giving him the Heimlich maneuver. \"Sir,\" I called to him, \"Sir, my name's Katherine Danvers, I'm going to give you the Heimlich maneuver, okay, just try to hold still for me.\"\n\nHe continued bucking wildly against me. \"Sir, please.\" I called out again. Nothing. I saw then that his headphones were still on. After a second of readjusting, I managed to pull his headphones off. \"Sir, my name is--\"\n\nI was cut off when his body abruptly seized, followed by him blasting out the most horrific, most startling, and just the single most *unnatural* scream I'd ever heard in my life and/or ever could hear. I instantly let go of him and he dropped to the ground, stiff as a board. His scream lasted for almost a full 30 seconds, long enough for it to be forever seared into my memory. Even after he'd stopped -- well, at least when I was *pretty sure* it wasn't him -- the scream itself still lingered in the air like a foul smell, passing itself through everyone else gathered around as well. The guy laid now on the ground in front of me, lifeless and frozen in this weird, freakish looking upward thrust with his back bent off the ground, stomach facing the ceiling.\n\nMy own body froze as well, stuck with my knees huddled to my chest almost in a fetal position, shaking. For a moment, time seemed really to freeze all throughout the club. Each set of eyes from the crowd was fixed on me, mouths hanging halfway to the floor. Finally, someone managed to break the stupor by pulling out their phone and calling the cops.\n\nEveryone else then started filing out in an unorganized, utterly manic manner. Not me, though. I couldn't even force myself to try and make any part of me move. I couldn't even take my eyes off of the guy's body, either. My eyes were fixed on his, with his staring back at me, blank and soulless.\n\nHis scream, despite having died out everywhere else in the club building, continued echoing in my own head. I couldn't place it at that moment, but I knew something about it wasn't natural. Something about it was... I don't know, just *wrong!*\n\nI stayed in entropy like this until I was shaken back to the real world by Jenna shaking my shoulder. \"Kat.\" she called out, rocking me gently. \"Kat, you okay, babe?\" My head snapped to her, then again one last time to the body, then back to her before absently nodding yes. \"Come on, let's get out of here.\"\n\nShe helped me up and the two of us joined the rest outside. Everyone was asking each other frantically what they all thought was going on.  Jenna and I just stood waiting for the authorities to arrive. It was only another minute or so before they did. The crowd was then divided and questioned individually. I refused to leave Jenna's side.\n\nJenna and I were pulled to the side and asked for our side of the story. I had no idea what the hell any of the other people were saying about me but judging from the rather suspicious looks on their faces, I could tell something was being spun against me. The both of us did our damnedest to emphasize the fact that I was there *only* to help the guy, that he'd been seizing even before I touched him. I could see though that this did about as much to convince them as if I'd just stayed silent. In either case, Jenna and I were still good to go home.\n\nI was about to walk to my car when Jenna stopped me, offering to give me a ride back with her. \"There's no way I'm letting you go home by yourself after that.\" she declared. I'd have protested but I'd known by that point, having already been good friends with her for at least 2 years by that time, that when she put her foot down like she was here, it was wise not to question or refuse unless you were willing to risk your ass being the next place her foot went. That was admittedly one of the reasons I wanted to be more with her. Always the more headstrong of the two of us while I was the more calculated one.\n\nOf course, this also meant that I'd get to bunk overnight at her place -- an even bigger plus, even if neither me nor her were in any mood to fool around. The ride was silent, almost suffocatingly so. I could tell both of us wanted to say something about it, but then, what? What really *could* be said other than that it was the single most horrifying thing either of us had witnessed in our lives.\n\nIt wasn't until we got back to her place that either one of us spoke to the other. \"Hey, you okay?\" she asked me. I looked at her, my face probably shaking and obviously anxious. She started toward me. I held my hands up.\n\n\"I-I'll be okay, it's just...\" I looked down to the floor then to the TV. My body was sort of on autopilot while my brain ran amuck.\n\n\"Just what?\" My attention snapped back to her.\n\n\"I don't know, just so crazy. I mean, what *was* that?\"\n\n\"Hell if I'd know, honey.\" She threw off her jacket before heading to her kitchen. I stood where I was, losing my focus to the TV again. \"Hey, You want a cold one?\" she asked.\n\nWithout taking my eyes away again, I replied, \"Yeah, sure.\" She told me to take a load off on the couch so I trudged over and plopped down in the center cushion. She joined me five seconds later with a six pack of Millers and a bottle of Harwood Canadian, ever since we were a couple of Freshmen girls. It was our favorite little combo for when it was the two of us. \"Here, Kitty Kat, this'll take the edge off.\"\n\nI offered her a weak half-smile before taking and downing a decent swig of the Miller. For about the next minute and a half, the two of us drank in silence until finally, having gotten herself a nice little buzz going, she looked at me and asked, \"Hey, you still wanna dance, Kitty Kat?\"\n\nI rolled my head to her. By that point, I was well under, though not enough to get blacked out. A grin stretched across my face. \"Fffuck yeah!\" I slurred excitedly.\n\n\"I've had a new CD I've wanted you to check out. You remember that little band we used to listen to, *Seraphim*, right?\" I nodded my head. How could I forget, the band her, me, and a couple other friends originally only listened to see if its little supposed \"curse\" was real. I even noticed she still had a few of their CDs. She pulled out her phone then and held up her music playlist to me.\n\nShe pointed to one of the songs at the top of the list and said, \"Check it.\" The song was titled something weird, **\"6\\_G\\_O\\_D-6\\_C\\_R\\_I\\_E\\_S-6\"**. Briefly scanning a couple of the other songs below it, I saw that they were all titled like this, all of them looking like a serial code or something. \"They're this techno group called '[Ghostwhispers.io](https://Ghostwhisperers.io)'.\"\n\n\"Huh, cool.\" I continued looking at the track. The album art was a sort of sloppily drawn skeleton wearing headphones. That was it.\n\n\"Yeah, you'll *love* it, I promise.\" She downed another swallow of her drink before going over and connecting her Bluetooth surround sound speakers to her phone. \"You ready?\" She hit the play button on the song.\n\nI was confused for a second when nothing happened. I looked at Jenna, who held her finger up, winking. Eventually, I began to hear it. It sounded like a low sort of rumbling noise that very, very slowly built in pitch and tempo. Imagine the stomping footsteps of an elephant approaching you, it was a lot like that if the footsteps also got higher on pitch the closer they came.\n\nSeveral wavelike sounds then came from the speakers that, at first, made me think the opening riff was about to queue, except it wasn't. Instead, two or three more of them passed through the room. Following this was a weird sort of heartbeat sound that, after a few more passing waves, the two sounds synchronized with one another. I looked at Jenna again. She had her eyes closed, bopping her neck back and forth.\n\nI couldn't understand because, not only was there no music (at least, nothing *I'd* have considered music), but her head bops weren't even in rhythm with the actual sounds themselves. The rhythm stayed the same, steadily growing higher and higher in pitch, yet her bopping was much more erratic by comparison. Then, when I'd say the rhythm from the song reached about a mid-range sound, I started to notice something about the wave sounds. Or rather I should say, *sobbing* sounds.\n\nI don't know how best to describe the sound other than what you'd think of if you imagined two or three whales simultaneously crying deep underwater. It was low and incoherent, yet all the same, I could somewhat *feel* this cloud of overwhelming sadness, as well as a sense of ominous dread coming from it. When it started getting louder and louder, so too did the bass blasting from the speakers, causing my entire body to vibrate inside and out.\n\nJenna still wasn't bothered by this, though. I started to wonder if somehow, we were listening to a different song altogether. Then I heard a noise like an extremely deep voice come from the speaker saying, *\"By man's will, the almighty weeps...\"* As garbled as it was, that's really only my best guess as to what I heard.\n\nWhatever it was though was immediately followed by this high-pitched squeal, sort of like a guitar trill that almost immediately broke my eardrums, literally to a point where, even to this day, I actually still have a hard time really hearing anything. I looked over to Jenna, who had her face contorted in a silent sort of scream, kinda like when you're listening to a heavy song and you react by screaming like the vocalist is, it was like that only she was perfectly still.\n\nIn fact, so was everything else. It took a second, but I actually noticed that the speakers weren't vibrating anymore like they were earlier. As well as this, my own body wasn't vibrating anymore, even though the bass was still blasting from the speakers. I tried to look around the room, but I couldn't move my head, only my eyes and even *that* was more of a struggle than it should've been.\n\nI noticed too that the room was turning greyscale. The LED lights Jenna had around her living room now weren't colored or glowing. Jenna herself even looked like this. The screeching noise by now was a sort of droning ambience in the background. I started hearing more voices coming through the speakers, mixing and distorting as they came closer toward me. I couldn't make out anything they were saying, except for one thing, screamed at me in another language.\n\n**\"Deus sumus, et flemus a te. Parasitus es et finiendus es.\"**\n\nThis, too, then dispersed into a multitude of other crying voices. They were all mxied, too. Some were men's voices, some women, some of them were even *children's* voices! They were mixed languages, too, like the one from earlier. All of them were saying different things at the same time, none of which I could understand, but whatever it was, it was done so out of fright.\n\nI would almost be willing to swear this carried on for hours, but as I found out only a second later, only three minutes passed since this all began. Eventually, the music ended and I saw everything normally again. I came to and saw Jenna grinning at me. \"So, whatcha think?\"\n\nI didn't reply. Her face fell into one of concern. \"Kitty Kat? Yoo-Hoo, anyone home?\" I didn't answer. The world felt normal again, but I still couldn't make myself move. Not even out of shock or anything either, but like something was actually holding me perfectly still. \"Kat!\"\n\nShe came over and started shaking me. In my mind, I could almost feel my lungs tearing from how much I was screaming out to her, but no sound actually came out. \"Kat! Kat, come on, baby. Katherine!\"\n\nI heard her voice start to jumble like the ones from the beat earlier. My name started to twist and morph into other words in her distorted voice, words I couldn't understand except for this phrase, **\"Hominum flebit...\"** repeating over and over. Jenna began slapping me to wake up, but I couldn't even feel it, or anything for that matter. My body was essentially a vegetable, only *really* conscious inside my own head.\n\nI could see and hear, but not move or feel. It wasn't until long afterward that I *knew* that I wasn't dreaming any of this, or dead, when I watched and heard Jenna call 911, who showed up about 15 minutes later and took me to the hospital where I \"woke up\" so to speak. During all of this, My mind was screaming, along with the other million, hundred million, possibly *billion*, other voices I was hearing screaming those two words to me.\n\nWhen it all stopped finally at the hospital, I found Jenna asleep in the chair next to my bed. Her hand held mine gently. I moved my hand, my head to look around, and even wiggled my toes. I could move my body again. I was back. Jenna stirred awake soon after.\n\n\"Well good morning, Kitty Kat.\" she said with a groaning, sort of early morning chuckle. I looked at her, my face a mix of confusion and exhaustion. \"Oh good, you're actually moving, too.\"\n\n\"J-Jenna...\" I said groggy, \"What the hell happened, why am I here?\"\n\nShe scoffed dryly and replied, \"I was kind of hoping you'd tell me, sugar.\" I just kept staring at her. \"You don't remember last night?\"\n\nI squinted my eyes, rubbing my head, which was pounding like crazy for some reason. \"Um... I... I-I don't...\"\n\n\"How're you doing this morning?\" Jenna and I both looked to see the doctor entering the room. I exchanged glances between him and Jenna before answering, still groggy, that I was fine. He had me then sit up and start going through all the regular check-up routines before tapping my knees with a mallet. My reflexes were fine, but when he attempted to check my hearing, something weird happened. Whenever he hit the button to trigger the beep in the headphones I was wearing, I didn't hear the beep, but instead the phrase from before, **\"Hominum flebit\"**.\n\nI still raised my hand when I heard it for the first few times, but then, after about the 7th or 8th time, I felt my body go stiff again. This time, along with the abandonment of my senses, I could feel something heavy sort of stuff itself inside my head like it was a glass jar. You know how when you eat too much, your body feels like a giant brick of lead has replaced your organs? This was like that, only it was all inside my head, nowhere else, and instead of food -- instead of something *tangible* \\-- it was filled with the low, deep sobbing noise from the song.\n\nThe pressure alone made my head prone to explode. The sounds in it got louder and louder as well, silencing the world around me. I couldn't take it anymore, but when I opened my mouth to scream, I couldn't make any sort of sound. At all. Not even a whimper or gasping or wheezing, nothing. I could barely even *breathe*, in fact.\n\nOne of the worst parts about this was, thanks to my mind being as infested as it was, I couldn't even internally scream \"What the fuck\" like I wanted to. I couldn't form *any* of my own thoughts. My mind was as empty as my body this time. The only sign this time that I was still alive was my sight. I could see Jenna and the doctor calling out to me and shaking me again, but now couldn't feel OR hear them.\n\nI remember being wheeled out of that room and back into the O.R. Another thing that scared me about this was just how *slow* time seemed to move. I mean, I couldn't have been in the audiology room for any more than ten or twenty minutes, yet, I could almost also swear that I was in that room for 2 *hours.* The same with when they wheeled me down the hallway to the O.R., the hallway stretched for a frickin' eternity, despite being only a couple rooms away from the Audiologists.\n\nIn the O.R., I watched figures all around me scrambling with various surgical implements. I could tell from body languages that they were all panicking, though about what exactly, I couldn't really tell except that it was to revive me. I must've been in critical condition, I thought. *I'm gonna die.*\n\nThe whole time, all I *could* hear was the sobbing and crying in my head. Even my screams were silenced by them, too. Imagine for a moment that you're a dummy, a wooden puppet, and you KNOW you're a puppet, and you're forced to watch the world around you while someone else is talking for you. You want to scream out with your own voice, but you can't because you essentially have no voice of your own. That's exactly what this was, save for the fact that ONLY I could hear the voice that wasn't mine.\n\nThis time, I have no idea how much time had actually passed before I came out of this spell because it was a while before it even registered that I actually WAS back. A sort of delayed effect, you know, like it all stopped, but you don't even realize it because of just how overstimulated your brain was to it? Eventually though, I did come out of it to find myself in the hospital room I was in before. I couldn't tell where I was at first because of the way everything was happening so fast, feeling like the 9th acid trip I never had (cleaned myself up after the 8th), that it also hadn't registered to me that I'd been moved here.\n\nIt was dark, the clock beside me reading 10:30 P.M. I picked my head up as much as I could and tried looking around the room. \"J-Jenna?\" No one answered. I was alone in the room.\n\nMy head fell back down, and I just stared back at the ceiling. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't move, not much anyways. Just lay in bed and stare at the fuckin' ceiling. Ironically, I feel like the quiet was just as detrimental to me mentally as the voices screaming in my head were. At least with that, *something* was happening -- God only knew *what*, but it was *something*. Now though, I was all alone.\n\nMy thoughts were mine, sure, but that was far from consoling. All I could think was that I was starting to lose my mind, and there was no fathomable reason as to why. I don't have any history of mental illness, I've been clean from drugs like I mentioned before for over 3 years now, and I knew that I wasn't making any of this shit up, despite how much I actually wished to God that I was.\n\nThe only thing I could connect any of this shit to was that song. That made me start thinking a little bit.  The song itself was called \"God Cries\" and the track sounded like someone was crying, not to mention the words themselves that kept repeating in my head, which I was starting to realize sounded like Latin. What was said, though, I had no idea at the time. I couldn't look it up yet, either, because I didn't have my phone with me.\n\nThe next morning, a nurse came in and went through the routine check-up. Just like before, my reflexes were slower than they should've been, even *more* so than the previous day in fact, not to mention my body feeling even more still than before as well. Each movement of any of my muscles ached like crazy. Afterwards, though, I still asked if I could have my phone brought to me. She agreed, somewhat reluctantly for some reason, and brought it to me.\n\nAfter she left, the first thing I did was to check my messages to see if Jenna may've said anything, maybe a *\"Hey, I'm worried to death about you, call or text me when you get this to let me know shit's okay, love you\"* or some shit like that. Sadly, There was no such message, or any message at all, from her. Next, I opened Google to search the meaning for the phrase \"Hominum Flebit\" and the other phrases from the music. Before I even got that far, an article from my newsfeed caught my eye. It was the club from two nights ago with a headline reading **\"Owner of nightclub sued for soliciting illegally pirated music and the death of patron\"**.",

        "text": " My name is Jackson Stone. I am 19 years old, and this is the story of events that led to the near death of the human race. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13 years ago, our government went to war with many others of the world. But what they didn’t tell us, was that they had a secret biological weapon developed and perfected over many years. This virus, as they were calling it, was responsible for infecting, and over time, turning people and animals into horrific monstrosities of their former selves. The government, our government in the United States, was responsible for the following outcome of the war.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The war started in the year 2022, when the United States invaded multiple countries. Our government thought it was the best possible course of action, to invade all our enemies at once. They dictated their soldiers to invade North Korea, China, and many other countries at once in a surprise attack on those who were considered enemies. While the infantry was keeping enemy troops in check and occupied, the government sanctioned a private science sector, known as A.D.B. otherwise known as the American Department of Bioweapons. This department was sanctioned for the sole purpose of using a deadly virus to make a bioweapon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This virus was known as Hyproxis. No one knew about this virus until The Invasions, as this virus is not of human creation. No, this virus came from space. There was an asteroid crash in the Northern Hemisphere in the early 2000’s. This virus has been known to turn anything into a monstrosity of their former self. It affected animals and humans alike, regardless of genes or breed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The scientists behind this program, working for the A.D.B, were responsible for weaponizing Hyproxis. They replicated it in laboratories, using small amounts from the chunk of asteroid it came from. The scientists would then dilute Hyproxis and put it into droppable gas bombs. While the U.S. troops were holding off enemy soldiers, the gas bombs would be silently dropped in areas to infect enemy soldiers. Hyproxis, which would enrage and infect anyone who came into contact with it, was quite deadly as it would turn people on one another. \n\n \n\nWhile the former people, now in their monstrous forms, were attacking the non-infected in the buildings and trenches, the U.S. soldiers were able to push and eliminate the enemy. Although this seemed effective, it quickly got out of hand. The United States government sanctioned 85 bunkers, which took roughly 9 months to build. Each bunker was a different size. The first bunkers were the ones for important people. Politicians, senators, congressmen and women, and of course the President. The capacity for each bunker is roughly 15,000 people.\n\n \n\nEach came with its own nuclear reactor for power, a hydroponics for food, a schooling area for the children to be had in the bunker, a cafeteria for eating, a commons for relaxation and mingling between residents, and of course an armory for the bunker guards. Hyproxis was out of control. It infected multiple countries very quickly, as the virus was airborne and could spread quickly. The problem was, we expected it to dissipate. It never did, and eventually U.S. citizens were quick to contract the disease. This led the government leading everyone into bunkers and shutting the doors for the foreseeable future. This was a full extinction event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The year is now 2035, 13 years after the first Hyproxis infection. I’ve always lived a quiet life in the bunkers. My family entered Bunker 81 in the year 2023, one year after the first weaponized versions of Hyproxis were deployed. My mother and sister died on the journey to the bunker. We were all driving as fast as we were allowed in order to safely get a spot in the bunker. During the trip we came to a guarded checkpoint, a crossing. A bridge, which was suspended over the Hudson River. With as many people that were trying to get to the bunker, the weight was too much for the bridge to support. As traffic was jammed, my family and I decided to make a run for it, leaving the majority of our belongings behind. People were screaming, guards were shouting orders, and gunshots starting to ring out. I think the added weight from all the vehicles as well as the makeshift checkpoint that had been built here was too much for the bridge to support, and this was made evident by the groaning of the cables as the weight became too much to support. The bridge collapsed under my sister and mother, as they were behind me and my father. I turned around to the familiar scream of my mother and watched as they were lost to the river below.  My father and I journeyed over the next day to the bunker, and were accepted inside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In the current day, all male residents of the bunker, that are aged 18-20 are required to do 1 mandatory scouting run to the outside world. Today is my day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey, kid, how ya holding up?” Asked officer Purna.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m doing alright, sir. I’m actually quite excited to see the real world and how much has changed in the 13 years I’ve been in the bunker.” I replied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well get ready Jackson, here comes our head officer of the expedition.” Purna said, with a sly smile playing on his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current head officer for our scouting run, would be officer Mack. Mack was well known as one of the most highly liked officers in the bunker, as he was always going out of his way to help others and improve everyone’s lives on a daily basis. His wife, Sarah, worked in hydroponics producing food for the bunker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well Purna, what do we have here? These are our 2 cadets for the day?” Mack stated with a somewhat superiority tone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes, sir, these are the cadets whom we will be taking with us for our run today.” Purna said while pointing at me, and the other cadet whose name I was unaware of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Let’s get moving, then.” Mack said without giving time for any further questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone was geared with a survival pack, with enough rations for 3 days. Everyone had a flare, to signal for others in case we got split up, as well as a standard M9 Beretta handgun, with 3 clips of ammunition. Once we had all packed our gear into our pack, we started for the entrance of the vault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We’re taking these cadets out for their mandatory scouting run today, Jeff, so open up.” Mack said to the sleepy guard operating the bunkers air pressured sealable titanium door. As the door opened, it emitted a high squeaking noise, as well as a hissing from the air pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I took my first steps out into the new world, I was in awe by what scene was unfolding as the door opened before my eyes. The sky was a dark gray cast, contrary to the blue I remembered from being a small child. The earth around the bunkers entrance was a dark brown cast tone, and it was apparent the nuclear warheads that were detonated after civilians had entered the bunker to stem the flow of Hyproxis were still taking their toll on the land years later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Still as beautiful as ever, eh Mack?” Purna said with a laugh.\n\n“Yeah, just makes me wish we could change everything back to the way things were before.” Mack stated coldly while staring at the mountain in the distance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all grouped up and started walking together, heading due east. It was officer Mack leading, with me and the cadet whose name I still did not know in the middle, while officer Purna brought up the rear. We walked in silence for around an hour, before I spotted my first real buildings in the new world. It was a small tan shack, only around 10 feet long by 8 feet wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Remember this place, boys. This is a shelter we built a few years ago to help scouts who couldn’t make it back to the bunker by nightfall, or who were injured and needed rest before heading back. And believe me, you do not want to be out here during the night.” Mack said with a highly matter-of-fact term.\n\n \n\nWe continued on, only giving small glances at the shack before moving on. Mack told us to keep quiet and not speak unless it was urgent, so we did just that. Our group continued walking for roughly another hour, and I could see through the overcast sky that the sun was going to set soon. The time on my watch said it was 4:52 P.M, so it was going to be dark in roughly 1 and a half hours, since the sun has been said to set by scouts around this time of year and 6:30 P.M. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“About how much further do you plan to take these kids, Mack?” Purna said from the back of the group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, I planned on taking them to the Burn.” Mack said while keeping his momentum and moving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What’s the Burn?” I asked while taking a few seconds to catch my breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The Burn is a huge open crater left by some old buildings that had collapsed and exploded. The place constantly has fires, and usually is ridden with infected during the nighttime.” Purna said with a bitter tone. \n\nWe kept moving at a decent place until our group was standing over the ledge of an enormous crater. The crater was probably 300 feet in length, and well over 1000 feet wide. There was collapsed rubble and concrete everywhere from the buildings Purna had mentioned, but no sign of any infected creatures, or people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright kids, this is as far as we go. It’s almost nighttime and we’re gonna be lucky if we make it back to the small scout shelter before sundown. Let’s get a move on.” Mack said while turning around.\n\n \n\nI saw out of the corner of my eye, a small shadow moving throughout a set of rubble. Before I could ask anyone what it could be, I heard an ear-piercing scream from the other cadet. I turned around instantly to see the cadet on the ground with some sort of thing hovering over his body. It looked like a dog, or a wolf, but its skin was heavily tearing at the seams from what looked to be bulging muscles beneath. It had a slight translucent red tone to its skin, and its eyes were a glowing shade of yellow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe creature instantly turned his attention from us to the cadet trapped on the ground under its weight, and tore into his esophagus, letting a small spray of red misty blood into the air. The cadet's screaming was cut short by the creature’s action, and we all turned around and immediately started running. I ran purely off of adrenaline and fear back onto the path leading back to the small scout shack, and did not stop until I got there. When I arrived, I noticed Purna was right behind me and was already readily opening the door and grabbing supplies to take inside out of his supply pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright Jack, I lost Mack along the path but I’m sure he’s going to turn up soon enough.” Purna stated while still unloading supplies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What was that? What just murdered the other cadet?” I said, with a slight shake in my voice from the adrenaline and the fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, Mack was stupid for taking you guys clear to the Burn, since he knows infected things roam that area sometimes. But that is what the scouts have nicknamed Wargs. Nasty things really, infected versions of common house dogs or wild wolves. Very big, very mean, very aggressive. Not so dangerous alone but in a pack, they can be a pain to deal with.” Purna said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You took us there knowing things like *that* were in the area?” I said with a slightly angry tone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Listen, kid, calm down. We didn’t know they were going to be there. Usually, they don’t come out until nightfall, so for a lone one to attack us, even in a group, during daylight means food is getting scarce. They’re desperate.” Purna said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as he finished his sentence, we heard a pounding on the door to the shack. I fumbled to grab my M9 Beretta out of my holster and take the safety off as I looked to Purna for instructions. He slowly motioned to check the peephole in the door, and as soon as I did, I instantly threw the door open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStanding in front of us was a slightly bloody and sweaty Mack, who looked worse for wear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Jesus Mack, what the hell happened to you?” Purna said while staring at Mack’s arm, which he was pressuring with his other hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Same Warg that got Peter got a hold of my arm down the path. I got a bullet through its head, but not before it took a chunk out of my arm.” Mack explained while sitting down to bandage his wound. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright Mack, it’s too dangerous to work towards the bunker tonight. Let’s wait until morning before we head back to the doors.” Purna said while closing the door and grabbing Mack first aid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not realize until I sat down how tired I was, mainly due to the adrenaline keeping me active. As I slowly nodded off to the sound of Purna giving Mack first aid and them talking about the route to take to the bunker tomorrow morning, I fell into a deep sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke to the sound of Purna packing supplies into our bags, and I could see light filtering through the shades of the single window placed in the shack. As I stood up and gathered my pack from Purna who was still packing items, I noticed Mack was a paler shade then yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Is Mack going to be, okay?” I asked Purna.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, we’ve never experienced a Warg bite before, since normally we don't scout at night, but I’m sure the doctors back in the bunker can treat him and get him back into fighting shape in no time.” Purna said with a smile on his face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded slowly while continuing to pack my stuff, and noticed Mack was awake. He grabbed his canteen and guzzled down some water, with a groggy look on his face. He nodded towards me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You sleep alright, kid?” Mack said with a raspy tone to his voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes sir, even with everything that happened yesterday I was too tired to stay up any longer after my adrenaline faded.” I replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, good. Let’s get a move on to our bunker.” Mack said without giving time for further conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all finished packing our gear and headed outside into the daylight. There were small animal tracks outside in the slightly wet dirt, but nothing as big as the Kurn we came across yesterday. We traced our steps back along the path to the bunker, and arrived within a few hours at the huge titanium doors to the bunker. Mack was too sick it seemed to be of any help getting in, while Purna got the guards to allow us back in the bunker. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I was afraid.",

Let me start out by saying, that was one helluva week we just had here at the apartment complex. You think you’ve seen it all, and then you spend the better part of half a day chasing a little gnome-like creature around in this old lady’s apartment, it’s high-pitched laughter mocking you everytime he slips through your fingertips. I ALMOST got him this time too. I was SO close. \n\nIt’s always the same call, from the same resident. Mrs. Baxter will call the office and put in a work order about there being rodents in her kitchen. The first time it happened, I arrived with an assortment of mousetraps and poisons- ready to deal out vermin genocide. I put them in strategic positions throughout the home and baited them with a variety of cheeses and peanut butter. When I went back the next day to check them, all of the spring loaded traps were tripped, the bait missing. I noticed that one of the sticky glue traps was nowhere to be found.\n\nI was busy resetting the spring traps, when something small and obscure caught my eye. It was a shred of paper, small and folded, and placed ideally on top of one of the traps. It was roughly the size of my fingernail, and folded into the shape of an origami bird.\n\n“What the hell?” I thought, as I delicately picked it up by a paper wing. It looked like something was written on the inside of the small page. Gingerly, I unfolded it to reveal a small drawing of a middle finger. Sitting there perplexed, I heard a high pitched laughter coming from above me. I glanced up just in time to see a small humanoid creature on the top of the cabinet giving me the finger. \n\nHe was about as tall as a soda can and wearing a tuxedo made of what looked like dollar bills. He looked like a normal person, all things considered, only he was half a foot tall, had a long red beard and he was holding some kind of white square-ish patch looking thing that was as large as he was. It took a moment, but then I recognized it for what it was. The missing glue trap. He mischievously shot out his tongue, and threw the sticky trap, hitting my face. It stuck to my forehead, tangling and sticking to my hair. \n\nIt’s been war ever since, between the Tiny Man and myself. In the 3 or 4 skirmishes that we’ve had, he always manages to get away. I don’t know what he is exactly, but he seems to have an uncanny talent for disappearing. He’s a little prick and I hate him. We always end up fighting, Tom and Jerry style. It’s not quite THAT bad, but he did drop a frying pan on my foot that one time.\n\nAnyway, earlier this week I had my most recent encounter with the Tiny Man, and this time, I think I may have actually got the little bastard. After chasing him all around the house, I managed to get him cornered in the kitchen. Little bugger is fast for a pygmy, or whatever in the hell he was. I had him blocked, the only way into the kitchen, was the only way out of the kitchen. Panic overcame his little face, as he realized this too.\n\nThen, quickly he bounds up and onto the countertop and into the sink, half full of dishes on one side. He’s flinging silverware at me. Forks, knives, spoons, he even managed to stab me with one of those corn on the cob holder things. But I was fed up with him and his bullshit by that point, so I kept coming determined to end this. In a last ditch effort to finish things once and for all, I closed in. To get away, he jumps down into the drain. Right where I wanted him. I flicked the small switch on the wall behind the sink. Loud grinding noises flooded the room as the garbage disposal began shredding any and everything that was caught within its chamber.\n\nI let it run for at least 5 minutes straight, frequently flushing down scalding hot water just for good measure. I’m happy to report that since then, we haven’t received a single call about it. Ladies and gentlemen, it would seem that we got him.\n\nAccording to Jason and The Manual, he was probably a leprechaun. When that old lady moves out one day, we should recommend a kitchen remodel. We might just find some gold.\n\nThere was a separate incident later that day, a reoccuring one, that reared its ugly head again. I’m talking about the human shaped holes. \n\nAccording to the Manual, they first started popping up back in the late 80’s. They occur in short bursts over the span of a couple of weeks, and then, as quickly as they began, they just stop. Then nothing for six years, only for them to return with a vengeance.  It only ever lasts for a couple of weeks, but it’s a pain. It’s a regular event, almost even a predictable one, like locust swarms or eclipses.\n\n“It’s human hole season, again” Jason had told me that morning. I merely looked at him perplexed. I hadn’t been working here the last time they appeared, so I had no idea what he was talking about. I have since then been enlightened. It sucks. I couldn’t help but notice that even though this obviously wasn’t new to Jason, the fact still made him seem perturbed. He sulked around all afternoon like somebody had pissed in his cornflakes.\n\nI arrived with Jason at the first one reported in. I had asked him several times what in the hell a ‘Human Hole’ was, but he had kept putting me off with a cryptic “You’ll see, soon enough.” Now I was seeing, and I understood. I mean, I don’t know their purpose, where they come from, what causes them, none of that, but I completely understood why they called them ‘Human Holes’.\n\nIn the apartment, on the wall that divided the bathroom with one of the bedrooms, was a hole in the adjoining sheetrock. It was in the perfect outline of a person. It reminded me of that old Looney Tunes gag, where the coyote runs smack into a wall hard enough that it leaves a perfect silhouette of them behind.\n\nUpon even closer inspection, it was a clean hole. No jagged cuts or crumbling of the drywall around the edges to indicate if it were done with any cutting utensils. No, it looked more as if a precision laser or some other such refined technique had been used. There was even an electrical wire and wall studs that crossed that section inside the wall, and examination showed them to be cut as well. A cut so fine that it was damn near surgical.\n\nAfter seeing it for the first time, I took a cautious step closer to get a better look, when Jason grabbed me by the shoulder and yanked me back a step. “DON’T go through” he said in a serious tone. I wasn’t going to, but he hadn’t known that. I gave a nod and he removed his hand from my shoulder.\n\nWe photographed and documented the Human Hole, size and orientation and so on, and then began our work of replacing the entire sheetrock segment that it resided within, after replacing the electrical wiring and wall studs of course. One down, plenty more to go by that point, with more getting called in by the hour.\n\nEven odder than the Human Holes themselves, were the attitudes of the residents that resided within the apartments that manifested them. This being my first rodeo dealing with this particular anomaly, I was expecting them to be a bit more concerned about the random man-shaped hole that had appeared in their homes magically overnight. Aside from calling it in to the office initially, none of them spoke a word about it, not to us anyway. I noticed they all seemed indifferent to this oddest of occurrences, oblivious even. I voiced as much to Jason.\n\n“That’s probably because they stepped through” he answered, leaving me only more confused. \n\n“They studied it in depth years ago, back when it first started happening. Apparently all of these people, the ones whose holes we’ll be patching for the next few weeks, well, they’ve been having some pretty weird dreams leading up to this, all with a common thread. In all of their dreams, a disembodied voice tells them to step through. Step through. Step through. Every night, drilling it into their subconscious, step through. Then, whenever these holes magically appear one day, these perfect human-shaped holes, what do you think they’re gonna do? Probably what the voice has been slowly brainwashing them to do, that’s what” he finished. I sat there for a few moments, waiting for more. When it was obvious that it wasn’t going to come unbidden, I figured I’d play my role as the new guy and ask.\n\n“And?”\n\n“Hell if I know. If it does something to them, or changes them in some way, it’s not obvious. Old Mr. Davidson, he steps through every single time. He’s been here for three ‘Human Hole’ events, and he seems fine to me” he shrugged. “I wouldn’t risk it though.”\n\n“If it’s as harmless as all that, why did you look so disturbed about it this morning? It’s just some harmless holes” I asked.\n\n“Because it usually happens every six years. Like clockwork. USUALLY. This time… it’s only been two” was all he would say.\n\nI don’t know what the implications or repercussions of all of this will be. I just try to think of it as job security. There’s always plenty to do here at Country Manor. If not stemming from the odd occurrences and the apartments themselves, then from some of the residents. \n\nThat reminds me, I’ve gotta tell you guys about 283. I don’t know the guy’s real name, but we all just call him ‘Teen Wolf’. \n\nThey started calling him that last summer, when the outside temperature started rising and he broke out his summer wardrobe, which seems to consist exclusively of ‘wife beater’ shirts and a pair of maroon cargo shorts. The moniker ‘Teen Wolf’ was given when one day Jason saw him in his attire, and he said that was what it reminded him of. He wasn’t wrong, the guy has such thick body hair, Robin Williams would have been jealous. It was so thick, you could barely see the shoulder straps of his shirt, you just had to assume they were under there… somewhere. The hair overflowing from the collar of his shirt was so long, I bet it got tangled sometimes.\n\nReal nice guy, every interaction we’ve had with him went pleasant enough, but we know his secret. He’s at least partially responsible for why we have so many missing pet posters tacked up on the community board in the mailroom.\n\nI was called out late one evening to pour some more holy water in the toilet from hell, that’s the one in apartment 113 that screams sometimes when you flush it, amongst other things. I was walking back to my truck, when I saw a black and white cat prowling around by one of the street lights. The feline stuck out to me, mostly because he had a small splotch of black on his face, like a little Hitler stache. Thinking the nazi cat looked funny and walking over to try to get a picture of it, there was this big hairy blur of motion that came sweeping into the light, and just like that, it was gone. Along with meow-n fuhrer. There one moment, gone the next. \n\nI stood there stunned for several moments, thinking how that wasn’t even the strangest thing I’ve seen all day, but still mighty peculiar, when I heard the poor kitty’s cry coming from the darkness behind a bush.\n\nI probably should have just ignored it. Too much curiosity in a place like this can lead to an early retirement… from your life. Curiosity killed the cat, afterall, and in this analogy I was the cat. The actual cat, I don’t know what he would be, curiosity I guess, or perhaps he was just the thing curiosity was currently gutting behind that bush... Metaphors aside, I did something dumb and potentially dangerous, and crept over to check it out.\n\nAaaaand it was a werewolf. No doubt about it. Luckily, I didn’t think it had noticed me, so intent and zoned in as it was on disemboweling the poor pet. I can still remember the sounds of the poor kitty’s bones popping and breaking between the lycanthrope’s powerful jaws.\n\nI squatted there in those bushes, not daring to move, when the resident poked his head out of his front door and yelled “Hey the toilet is doing that… that THING again!” out into the street in the direction of my work truck.\n\nThis had several effects. The first being me almost shitting my pants. It had drawn the full attention of the werewolf as well, as it immediately stopped in the middle of peeling a muscle away from the now deceased cat’s hind leg. Its huge face shot in the direction of the resident’s shout, its large pointed ears aimed like radar dishes toward the noise.\n\nMy first thought was “That guy is sooo dead”. Surely the werewolf, or whatever in the hell it was, wasn’t going to be satisfied with just a cat. That residents yell might as well have been a dinner bell. Any moment now, it’s going to run and pounce on this poor guy and rip his throat out. Better him than me.\n\nImagine my surprise then when it had the opposite effect. The glint of bloodlust that had been in the creature's eye morphed into something more akin to fright. It looked scared. I watched it cower lower, then when the resident went back inside, unable to find me, I watched it bolt in the opposite direction.\n\nIt’s not everyday that you see a werewolf, even working here. I imagine it’s even more rare to see a werewolf tremble in fear at the prospect of being spotted by something that it could mangle and shred without even breaking a sweat. That’s why when it ran, I saw fit to follow it.\n\nAs it navigated between the buildings, quickly and carefully diving from shadow to shadow, I was doing the same. Eventually it came to an open window around the back of one of the apartments. It gave one final cautious glance, scanning the night for any prying eyes. When it’s bestial gaze landed upon me tucked into the shadows, I swear it lingered a moment longer than it had in the vacancy around me. I dared not even to breathe, and had one of the air conditioning units between us not been running, it probably could have heard my heart pounding in my breast. Seemingly satisfied that there were no witnesses, it closed the remaining distance and jumped through the window, slamming it shut and drawing the curtains behind it.\n\nAt first, I thought it was going inside to murder whoever resided there, until I realized WHO resided there. That apartment belonged to Teen Wolf.\n\nSo apparently, the guy that we joked around about being as hairy as a werewolf, was an ACTUAL werewolf. Good to know. That cluttered community board in the mailroom covered in lost animal fliers started making a little more sense. Shy lycanthrope. Shycanthrope. Better pets than people, I always say. Too bad Barbara wasn’t there to catch it on film.\n\nBarbara is a nuisance, but ultimately harmless. She was in the office the other day going off on Mrs. Tina, the office manager. Threatening to call the Better Business Bureau or the police or the FBI… or SOMEONE. Threatened to sue, to get this place shut down. Surely, we had to be breaking some kind of law or in violation of some statute or ordinance. Best of luck, lady. The guy that owns the place is supposedly some millionaire bigwig across the country. He doesn’t just own lawyers, he owns judges. That’s what they say, at least. \n\nBesides, Barbara was just mad because of what happened to her little dog. It had happened just a couple of weeks after she moved in. She had this little chihuahua. She took it for a walk one day and she ignored the signs over on the edge of the property. She got WAY too close to the pond and what she described as a ‘log with eyes and a mouth’, shot out a tongue and ate her little dog. When she screamed, it turned, and with a pair of gargantuan legs it jumped and disappeared into the murky and muddy waters.\n\nWe know how big some of the frogs and toads that live in that pond can get, and have the area posted and fenced off for a reason, hence, the signs. When she ignored them, she forfeited most of her legal standings, and therefore, wouldn’t have a leg to stand on in court. She was clearly trespassing.\n\nShe’s had it out for the place ever since, and it hasn’t become an uncommon sight to see her parked somewhere in a rental car with a pair of binoculars and a camera, spying and snooping. Oddest thing about it is that she still lives here so it’s almost 24/7. I imagine that if I hated a place with as much burning passion as she does this one, I couldn’t live there. And because she hated Country Manor with every fiber of her being, that usually meant that she hated us too by extension. I mean, it sucks what happened to her little dog, but it had nothing to do with us, WTF? I guess some people are just like that. They need to have an enemy to justify their righteousness.\n\nActually, I kinda admire her dedication. I find it hilarious that with all of the crazy and unexplainable stuff that happens here, she never manages to video anything noteworthy. She always shows up right after, being denied her sweet sweet money shot. We’ve been told not to interact with her unless it’s absolutely necessary, and if we do to ‘kill her with kindness’. There’s worse things out here to get killed by, if we’re being honest.\n\nNext week is supposed to be pretty busy, we’ve gotta get four apartments fixed up, painted, and ready to rent for some contracting company that wants to move in some of their employees for a job they’re doing in the area. Between getting that done and the calls we get for maintenance on the day to day, we should keep pretty busy. I’ll update you guys as soon as I can. Until then, Justin from the Country Manor Maintenance Department, clocking out.",

        "text": "I'm not sure if anyone will see this, but I feel like I need to share my story. My name is Owen, and I'm a teenage camper. I grew up in a small town in Southern California, and I've always loved spending time in the great outdoors. My parents were big hikers and campers, and they passed their love of nature down to me.\nI had always wanted to go on a solo camping trip, and I finally convinced my parents to let me go. They were a little hesitant at first, but I promised them that I would be careful and follow all the necessary safety precautions. After a lot of convincing, they finally agreed.\nI did my research and decided on Mendocino National Forest as my destination. It was a beautiful, secluded area that was known for its stunning wilderness and abundance of wildlife. I packed my backpack with all the essentials - a tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, water bottle, and enough food and supplies to last me a few days. I also brought my phone and a small speaker for some background music.\nI arrived at the forest on July 3rd, 2021. The sun was shining, and everything seemed normal. I parked my car at the designated camping area and set up my tent in a clearing near a small stream. I spent the day exploring the woods, marveling at the beautiful trees and the wildlife that surrounded me. I saw plenty of deer, and the forest was alive with the sounds of birds and small animals.\nBut as day turned to night back at camp, the forest began to fall silent. The crickets stopped chirping, and the only sounds were the crunching of leaves under my feet as I sat on the ground and the distant howling of a wolf. Feeling creeped out by the sudden silence, I went inside my tent and tried to ignore it and focus on my dinner, an MRE that I had brought from home.\nBut as I was eating, I heard something calling my name. It was a faint, whispery voice, and it seemed to be coming from the tree line. I froze, my heart racing in my chest. I tried to stay calm and think logically. Maybe it was just the wind, or some other animal. But as I listened, the voice grew louder and more insistent. It was definitely saying my name, and it sounded like it was trying to lure me out of the tent. I was terrified and questioned my psychological state. Had the isolation cause me to hallucinate? Are there other campers just playing a prank on me?\nI was terrified, but I knew I had to stay put. I zipped up the tent and huddled in my sleeping bag, trying to force myself to sleep and to block out the voice. But as the night wore on, the howling grew louder and more frenzied. I couldn't sleep, and I was starting to feel like I was being watched.\nThat's when it happened. I felt a sudden sense of heaviness wash over me, and I knew I was in the grip of sleep paralysis. I couldn't move or speak, and all I could do was lay there, helpless, as the creature approached the tent. I could hear it scratching at the fabric, trying to find a way in. And then, I felt it trying to unzip the tent. As it attempted to unzip the tent, I could hear and smell the thing's breathing, a putrid stench that made my eyes water. Its claws were scraping against the fabric, trying to find a way in.\nI don't know how long it lasted, but eventually, it walked away, dragging its feet across the ground. The paralysis lifted and I was able to break free. I stumbled out of the tent feeling the cold air on my face just for it to be standing  behind my tent, peeking behind a tree and staring back at me with glowing yellow eyes. My heart pounded in my chest as I took in its twisted, humanoid form, covered in slimy, black fur, it’s face like that of a man but disfigured and animalistic  in nature. I turned and ran the opposite direction through the forest, not looking back until I was sure I was safe.\nBut the creature didn't give up that easily. It followed me, stalking me through the woods as if it was planning its next move. I could hear its voice now guttural, calling my name, and I could feel its presence lurking behind me, and I could smell its putrid breath on the air. I was terrified, and I knew I had to find a way to scare it off.\nThat's when I remembered the music on my phone. I had connected it to a speaker that I had brought from home, and I had left it playing when I went to sleep. I didn't know if it would work, but I figured it was worth a shot.\nI grabbed my phone and turned up the volume as high as it would go. The music blared through the forest, and the creature let out a bloodcurdling scream. It retreated into the darkness, towards the music.\nI made it out of the forest just as the sun was rising, and I collapsed on the side of the road, completely exhausted. I was found by a park ranger a few hours later, and he took me back to Fort Bragg. He was shocked and disturbed by my story, and he told me that I had actually been missing for 12 days and discovered 8 miles away  from my camp, not a few hours as I was led to believe with search and rescue discovering my tent in ruin. With my foot prints from my tent disappearing as I left my camp. and the scent dogs not picking  up anything. He went on to tell me that there have been other cases like mine in the forest. People disappearing without a trace, never to be seen again, typically people who go alone or are separated from their group. The park ranger explained that they paused the search due to heavy rain fall after my disappearance. \nHe said that there are things in the forest that are beyond human understanding, and that we should be careful when we venture into the wilderness. He gave me a stern warning not to go back to the forest alone.\nI took his warning to heart, and I vowed to never go camping by myself again. I don't know what happened to the creature that stalked me, but I can only assume that it's still out there, lurking in the shadows and waiting for its next victim. I'll never forget that night in the forest, and I hope that my story serves as a warning to others. Be careful, and always be prepared for the unexpected.\nAs I left the forest and returned to my normal life, \nI never told anyone else about my experience in the forest, the police told  the media that I simply got lost on the wrong trail. but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to it. I began to research the history of the area, and I discovered that there have been numerous reports of mysterious disappearances and strange occurrences in the forest over the years. Some people believe that there is an ancient, supernatural force at work in the woods, preying on unsuspecting travelers. While others simply believe there’s a drug operation. \nI don't know if I believe in any of this, but I do know that I'll never take the forest for granted again. I'll always be careful and stay alert, just in case. The forest is a beautiful and mysterious place, but it can also be dangerous.",

        "text": "It was a hot summer day when the circus came to town. The colorful tents and blaring music lured in crowds of excited children and their parents. One attraction, in particular, caught my eye - a display of creepy clown dolls in the center of the main tent.\n\nI had always been afraid of clowns, but something about these dolls was even more unsettling. They had twisted grins and beady, glassy eyes that seemed to follow me wherever I went. I couldn't shake the feeling that they were watching me, judging me.\n\nDespite my unease, I decided to take a closer look. As I approached the display, I noticed that one of the dolls was missing. It was a small, porcelain doll with frizzy red hair and a sinister smile. I shrugged it off and continued my tour of the circus.\n\nAs the night went on, strange things started happening. I would see flashes of the missing clown doll out of the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, it was always gone. I tried to brush it off as my imagination, but the feeling of being watched only intensified.\n\nThe following day, I returned to the circus to see the afternoon show. As I took my seat, I couldn't help but notice that the red-haired clown doll was back in its place in the display. I tried to ignore the feeling of dread that washed over me and focused on the show.\n\nThe acrobats and animals were impressive, but the highlight of the show was the clown act. The main clown, a towering figure with a painted white face and bright red lips, performed death-defying stunts that had the entire audience gasping. But as the show went on, I started to notice something off about the clown.\n\nHis movements were jerky and unnatural, and his laughter seemed forced and hollow. And then, I saw it - the red-haired clown doll was perched on his shoulder, its beady eyes fixed on me. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to get out of there.\n\nI fought my way through the crowded tent and ran as fast as I could. I didn't stop until I was blocks away from the circus. I collapsed on a bench, panting and trying to catch my breath. That's when I saw it - the clown doll, sitting at my feet with a twisted grin on its face.\n\nI screamed and kicked it away, then fled back to my hotel room. I locked the door behind me and tried to calm my racing heart. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and I knew it was only a matter of time before the clown came for me.\n\nI barely slept that night, and when morning came, I packed my bags and fled the town. I never looked back, and I never spoke of the possessed circus to anyone. But to this day, I can still feel the red-haired clown doll's beady eyes on me, waiting for its chance to strike again.",

        "text": "let me start off this post by saying that i am a logical person. when something goes bump in the night, the last thing on my mind is the boogeyman. \n\nhowever, i think this time it might be.\n\nas the title suggests, my husband is no longer my husband. i don’t mean i got a divorce, i mean… fuck. i can’t even bring myself to type out the words.\n\nsomething has taken over his body. or he’s an imposter. or something. it isn’t him, i know it isn’t him.\n\nmy husband and i have been together for 5 years. we have a child together who is nearly 4 months old, my daughter. \n\nbefore all this started, my husband was loving and kind. a hard worker, working 13 hours days most days. he loves… loved? he loved me and our daughter more than anything.\n\nhe has never been the most affectionate kind of person. diagnosed as a person on the spectrum, certain things are completely out of his comfort zone. physical touch, sharing personal space, many different types of stimuli, etc. \n\nwe’ve had different bedrooms for years now and conceived our daughter…. medically. \n\nmy husband does not go out of his way to spend time in my space, doesn’t eat meat because of the texture, and NEVER raises his voice because he “doesn’t like the way it feels”. this will all be important later. \n\nas for my daughter, my husband is devoted to her. doting on her hand and foot, always cuddling her, tending to her every need, making sure she is never crying for more than a few minutes. all of it. she is delighted with him. or was.\n\nuntil what i’ve been calling “the switch”.\n\ni know what you’re thinking. parenthood is hard, people change, lack of sleep… change of routine, blah blah blah. i get that, i really do. but trust me when i say that’s NOT what’s happening. \n\nmy husbands routine has not changed. i sleep with the baby in my room every night, i’m the only one losing sleep. he takes her when he gets home from work, but if he needs to shower or play video games or whatever — i take her. \n\nnow, as for this… thing, parading around as my husband—\n\nthere are a couple of things that have been happening for several weeks now.\n\n1. i wake up to find him staring at me, maybe 3 or 4 inches away from my face, whenever i fall asleep before he goes upstairs to his room. if i nap on the couch, in my room, literally anywhere when *it* is around, i will wake up to the vacant, staring face of my husband inches away from my face. now. if i was watching someone when they slept, i personally would jump back and pretend like i wasn’t watching them the moment they woke up. who wants to explain why they’re staring at someone, right? well. this thing doesn’t give a shit. i will jump awake, try to laugh it off, question it, ask about the baby…. it will just back up and go do something else. no explanation, no change of expression, nothing. \n\n2. the MEAT. i had a heavy meat aversion during my pregnancy and paired with my husbands texture issues , we typically get our protein from other sources. as of late, i’m buying about 10-12lbs of meat a week. what happens to it? i have no idea. i’m not cooking it. i put it in the fridge, and it disappears. usually during the night? i’ve been trying to take inventory before bed (when i remember,) and the meat usually vanishes by morning. i DO have 4 pets (2 cats and 2 dogs) but i highly doubt they are getting into the fridge at night. mainly because they all sleep with me, shut inside the nursery behind a closed door. this thing has asked me “where all the meat is” several times. as well as cleared out the deep freezer. i made a 6lb rib roast for the two of us for christmas, it was gone before i got a piece. \n\n3. this next one might be a little controversial, and i’m sorry if this stresses anyone out — but please, hear me out. i’m tired, babies are hard work. my daughter no longer wants anything to do with my husband. his eyes no longer light up when he sees her or holds her, and she screams as soon as he/it enters the room or tries to speak to her. i will try to pass my daughter off to steal a few moments for a shower or to use the bathroom, but my hopes are short lived now because she will emit a blood curdling shriek as soon as my husband touches her.\n\n4. then there’s the spitting. oh my god the SPITTING. whatever the fuck this thing is— it can’t swallow. it’s like a soon as it’s mouth fills with saliva, it will just spit it out onto the floor. there’s fucking puddles of spit EVERYWHERE. i’ve asked it repeatedly to stop, or why it keeps spitting on the ground, and all i’ve managed to get is a shrug.\n\n5. the yelling. it has calmed down since it first started, which is somehow even weirder— but when i first started noticing the shift, my husband would scream or yell his responses at me, no matter how close we stood. it was not angry, but rather sounded like someone who couldn’t hear themselves speak or had headphones on. it makes me think of calibration. the noise, again, did not meet his eyes. nothing he says meets his eyes. \n\ni am genuinely at a loss. this thing doesn’t seem to want to hurt us, it seems indifferent at best. i will also say i’ve heard … a lot of ghost stories about the area i live in. i’m located in the mountains of west virginia, people are really weird about missing persons here, so i’m not sure who i could even talk to.\n\ni don’t know what to do, or where to turn. my parents (who live in AZ) just tell me i have PPD and to take my medication. but i can’t shake the feeling that it’s more than that.",

        "text": " \n\nDear Beatrice,        September 10th\n\nThe darkness is worse than before. I’m stuck. It's as if the ghosts of my past are all screaming at the same time. I can’t hear a thing! I wish I could see you once more. At least to hear the tendering singing of your voice. Alas, none the matter anymore. I shall never see you again, and I must accept that. \n\nAt least I can write these letters to you. Sometimes, I feel like writing these is the only thing that keeps me sane. Isn’t that funny? Writing about my sanity keeps me sane, yet doing nothing will drive me to the brink of insanity. Crazy, isn’t it? Life surely is a mystery. \n\nAnyway, how have you been? I’m sure you being all by yourself is frightening, as it is for I. Ma and Pa are doing just fine, if you wanted to know. They’re always fighting, but that's normal for them. It makes me remember how we first met. I remember how I had to leave because Ma and Pa were fighting, and I met you by the creek? Remember how we skipped stones and splashed around in the water? It was so fun! I sure hope we can do that again sometime.\n\nWith much love, your dearest Sammie \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,        September 13th\n\nAh, what a day! I went on a walk and saw a dead bird. Seeing it reminded me of the unfortunate passing of my dear sister, Sadie. It’s crazy, really. How you showed up after her death. You sure helped me a lot, you know. You helped me realize that I can live without my sister. I can live without everyone, as long as I have you. \n\nSpeaking of death, what is your opinion on it? I find it to be quite interesting. It is only the second stage after life. One can only imagine all of the stages after life. Do they exist, or is life the only thing there is? Oh, so many questions! \n\nMa and Pa sure do fight a lot. Have I mentioned that before? Well, so sorry that I keep on repeating myself. It’s just...hard sometimes. It adds on with everything else. They argue about me, you know. They say horrible things about me. They talk about sending me away! Oh, how I despise their talk. I just want it to end. I want it all to end!\n\nHowever, nothing seems to change. There is no other option left, I’m afraid. I cannot go away. Not now, when these are the only letters keeping me sane. Unless...I already am insane...no! Of course not! What silly accusations, my dear Beatrice. Silly accusations indeed. I am more sane than you, Beatrice. I’m the only one who knows about you, of course. I must keep your secret, but as the days go by it gets harder and harder. How could you do this to me? How could you ask me to keep such a secret? Haven’t I already done enough for you? Why do you ask so much of me? Please, answer me this time. I’m begging you. \n\nWith much love, Sammie\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,       September 20th\n\nOh Beatrice, why, oh why do you never answer? You used to be with me all the time. Now you’re gone, what happened? Was it my fault, or did something inside of me change? Please, oh please tell me. Even if these letters are meaningless, at least you’ve helped me. At least you’ve helped keep me sane. However, with you no longer here, I can’t promise that I’ll stay that way. \n\nHowever, I shall look on the bright side. I hope that we will meet again. If we do, I will be oh so happy. Even with you sent away, I still have hope. And that’s the most important thing. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,       October 2nd\n\nI’ve waited patiently, oh, so patiently. Please, please answer me! I’m going insane waiting! Ma and Pa are about to send me away! I cannot wait any longer. Once I’m gone, you won’t be able to respond!\n\n“Come on Sammie! We’re waiting!” Ma calls for me.\n\n“Hurry up you little brat!” Pa yells.\n\nOh Beatrice, I can’t stand it anymore! The pain, it's so bad! Even they don’t know about our little secret, Beatrice. I’m warning you, if you don’t respond I’m telling them. Please, oh please respond! I don’t want to tell them, I really don’t! But I’ve got no choice. Goodbye, for now Beatrice. I sure hope we meet again. \n\nLove, Sammie\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,         October 4th\n\nI’ve done it, Beatrice. No longer will I be sent away, and no longer do I have anyone to look after me. They should have known better than to talk so loudly. I’ll miss them, of course, but what’s done is done. \n\nYou may be upset, but at least our secret is kept. At least no one knows about you and I. I still take my medications, but I know that they are just holding me back from my true potential. So, tomorrow I shall stop taking them. \n\nI am quite scared, but also excited. It's been so long since I’ve been without my medications. I can’t wait to see the power unleashed. I can’t wait to see what I accomplish. Anyway, I hope you respond to me soon!\n\nLove, Sammie \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDearest Sammie,        October 8th\n\nHello there! I am so sorry for the wait, I have been quite busy, being away and all. How have you been? Well, I see you have already answered that! You have no idea how much I’ve wanted to see you! But you’ve been keeping me away, I’m afraid. You know what you have done. But I’m glad you have allowed me back into your life!\n\nI have seen that you have done everything you could to not get sent away. I am very glad to hear it. You sure are learning, which is great! Please continue to tell me what’s going on. Tell me if anyone gets in your way again. I know what to do, and so do you. \n\nOh, by the way; how is your best friend, Annie? Last time I checked, you two were doing well! I hope that she is still doing well! When you first started your medication, she was even better friends with you, so I hope that even with you off them she’ll stay around. But remember; no matter what she says, you MUST stay off them. They are not good for you, and they are the reason you’re so unhappy. So tell me if she does anything to try and get you back on them. Well, I hope to see you soon! \n\nWith much love, Beatrice :)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,        October 9th\n\nOh my, that response came faster than I thought it would! Well, to tell you the truth, I have seen Annie, but we are not on good terms. You see, she was the first one I told about the medications, and she was not happy. In fact, she did something that I must inform you about. \n\nShe told me that if I do not go back on them, she’ll inform my psychiatrist and have me locked away. I cannot do that, of course! But she’s my best friend, what should I do? I hope you reply soon with an answer. \n\nLove, your dearest Sammie. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDearest Sammie,        October 10th\n\nI see the predicament that you are in. On one hand, you will be sent away, so you will not be able to see me anymore. And on the other hand, you lose your best friend. While this decision is easy for me, it may not be as easy for you.\n\nPlease, do this for me. I know I am making you keep many secrets, and making you do many things for me, but trust me. This will all benefit you in the future. You know what you need to do, Sammie. You need to get rid of her. She is holding you back. She is the reason you’re so weak. She is the reason you’re so upset. \n\nI love her, Sammie. I really do, but we can’t have her holding you back. Soon she’ll realize what you’ve done with your parents. It’s all just going downhill from here. You know that. And besides, we don’t want her finding out about me, now do we? \n\nLove, Beatrice :)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,        October 12th\n\nYou have asked for so much this time. Yet I still did it. I had to. To make you happy. Are you happy? Annie is dead now. She will no longer be in the way. The pain still hurts though. Why, oh why? Please tell me why, Beatrice! The ghosts of my past are screaming, and now Annie's scream is echoing in my head along with them! Not to mention my Ma and Pa as well. \n\nYou said this would make me feel better, but it doesn’t. Why doesn’t it, Beatrice? Why is the pain still here? Please tell me, Beatrice. Yet with no answer coming, I must confess how hard it was to hide her body this time. I can’t hide it in my house, so I put her by the river. It was hard, but I did it. \n\nEach day I keep on thinking about going back on my medication. Was Annie right? No...nonsense! Of course she wasn’t. Right? Well, I hope to hear from you soon! \n\nWith much love, Sammie\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDearest Sammie,        October 13th\n\nNo, Sammie. Do not; I repeat, do NOT go back on medication. What’s done is done, and there’s no turning back. You have done a good job, but I know what you are missing. You aren’t satisfied yet. You need to do more. Get rid of MORE. Do it, for me, Sammie! Please. This world isn’t fair, and to keep you sane you must do the unthinkable. \n\nDon’t you dare tell anyone, don’t you dare stop. You must do more. We must do more. You understand? You must never stop, or else you will be sent away. For both of our sakes, don’t stop. \n\nYou know your neighbor, Mrs. Hatcher? She must be next. She knows too much, I can feel it. You can feel it, too, can’t you? You must get rid of her. Now do as you’re told and don’t screw up. Remember, I’m the only one who loves you, so you must listen to me. Remember, if you go back on medication, I will be gone forever. \n\nLove, Beatrice :)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Beatrice,        October 14th\n\nYou are right. I’ll do whatever you say. After all, the only one you can trust is yourself. I threw my medication away, so I’ll never go back to being weak. I will be strong. I will have you. With my medication, you do not exist. I promise I will make sure that you keep on existing. \n\nTomorrow, Mrs. Hatcher is dead. You can trust me on that. I’ll do anything to keep you here, even if that means killing the ones I love. Because from what I’m concerned, you’re the only one who loves me anyway. \n\nThey say you aren’t real, that you’re a figment of my imagination, but how could that be when you promise me so much love? I know you’re real, because if you weren’t, then I’d be crazy. And I’m not crazy; I just know it.\n\nLove, your dearest Sammie",

        "text": " I don't go to Yellowstone.  Well, at least not since 2001.  I know what you might be thinking.  Why avoid a place for over 20 years when there's no evidence of it erupting? I mean, there's plenty of things to do in the National Park.  Plenty of sites to see, including the ever so famous Old Faithful, and even some bears and other wildlife to view and snap shots of for family albums you'll spend over an hour scrapbooking.   \n\n\nBut for me my vow to never enter that place again started when I took a road trip with a college friend.  We had both finished our second year and wanted to start off our summer driving to Malibu all the way from Jersey.  We had seen way too many advertisements for it and thought it would be a good chance to maybe meet some girls and check out a few food stands. Corny as it sounds.  We were young and didn't really have a plan. But we did make enough time to map out where our relatives were from Point A to Point B. We would be visiting my relatives first in Ohio and his relatives second in Wyoming. Then after a resting point in Nevada, we would do a straight shot to California. And probably dunk ourselves in the water from all the sweat that accumulated in the car.   \n\n\nWell least to say we were exhausted from exiting Ohio and tag teaming each other to take the wheel in order to get to Wyoming. After a mutual decision, we both agreed to rent a cabin and do some sight seeing for a few days before marching back to my 1990 Toyota Corolla to head to his relatives for some half cooked peach pie or something like that.  I can't really remember what dish my friend detested but told me to just be polite and discretely get rid of it since his grandma was sweet and didn't know any better when she baked it.   \n\n\nWhat I did remember is him mentioning the kill zone.   \n\n\n\"Yeah, it's this place where if you die only 12 people living in it can act as a jury for whoever wacked you.  It takes forever to process a case,\" he said excitedly as he was packing up more gear and snacks to head on a trail we picked.  I had provided bear mace in my provisions and tucked it away where I could reach it in my pocket while we talked, and I just shook my head at this.   \n\n\n\"There's no way this can be real,\" I tittered.  He was always into trivia.  When he wasn't reading Nietzsche in Russian or talking about the rock formations of what we passed on our trip, he was reciting trivia to me.   \n\n\nHe swore up and down it was and said, \"No really!  That's one reason why people go missing up here! My mom tells me all the time not to go alone while visiting Yellowstone!\"   \n\n\n\"Are you sure she just didn't want you to fall into a hot spring?\" I laughed, not taking him seriously.   \n\n\n\"You know what, Jack? There's some spooky shit around here. There's a reason our families tell us to stick together instead of just wandering off around Yellowstone.\"   \n\n\n\"Yeah, okay.  Well, we need to head off if we want a good start on this trail so.\"   \n\n\n\"Fine, whatever,\" he just said, looking disappointed.   \n\n\nWe had decided to pick the trail next to Mammoth Mountain and I know my friend wanted to explore the area around where the hot springs were along with whatever else we could find.  We set off in the car and picked a spot to park next to our trail.  Once on the hike he kept looking around on occasion and told me bears come around here and to keep an eye out for them.  I just chuckled and brushed it off as borderline paranoia.   \n\n\nWhen we got to the halfway point that's when he wandered off and gestured with his hand for me to follow him.    \n\n\n\"Are you kidding?  These trails are marked for a reason.\"   \n\n\n\"Come on,\" he said, \"it won't take too long. It's just what a friend showed me last time we went up here. I promise we'll be back on the trail before you know it.\"   \n\n\nI scoffed, \"Whatever, man.  I just don't want to be the one to tell your parents you found your way into a hot spring.\"   \n\n\nHe just laughed and looked at me like I was in for some big surprise at the end.  He was right though.  It didn't take long for him to show me what it was.  It was about 30 minutes in that he showed me a big hunk of metal that appeared rusted and deteriorated next to a squirrel that looked like it had just decided to fall asleep and never wake up.   \n\n\nThere wasn't much else to take in. The area in this patch of dried  grass was quiet. Not a bird chirped. The sun lit the backs of the trees and the earth for that moment was still.  It almost could appear peaceful.   \n\n\nIf it wasn't for the smell.   \n\n\n\"Urgh, God. What is that?\" I coughed, covering my nose. The smell still crept in, permeating my nostrils with that awful stench. It smelled like burning iron, like pus, like being next to a vat of disposable chemicals. I almost felt sick.  Like I wanted to throw up.   \n\n\nMy friend could be so strange, but I miss him.  He just offered his extra mask he had brought and started to put one on himself.   \n\n\n\"I wanted to bring you here to get your opinion. You're studying this stuff, right?\" he asked.   \n\n\nMy eyes were starting to sting, like how you get when you're too close to onions.  And I got a really strange feeling about this place like we weren't supposed to be here. The air felt electric.  Like my skin was tingling and getting exposed to something unseen but harmful to us both.   \n\n\n\"I get what you're getting at, but we don't even have the right equipment to study it. I just think we need to go, man.\"   \n\n\nHe just sighed and looked at me sad.   \n\n\n\"Well, at least you're somewhat confirming it.\"   \n\n\nIt was then we heard someone talking from a distance.  Something in a different language I wasn't fluent in.  I could only make bits and pieces of the words while my friend froze like a deer trapped on a cliff next to a mountain lion.   \n\n\n\"Jack,\" he said slowly, \"when I give you the signal, you need to run.\"  He put his hand up and made it into a thumbs up, then slowly put it down.   \n\n\n\"What?\" I whispered, trying to suppress the growing panic in my voice. \"What do you mean?  Let's just go!\"   \n\n\n\"My friend never made it out, Jack. They did the same to him that they're going to do to me. They're debating if I'll join them, but I don't want to.\"   \n\n\n\"You have a family though! Let's just leave!\" I pleaded.   \n\n\n\"Exactly. And I'm not going to be a part of this. I know what they're planning to do. They're going to shoot me since I'll say no but they'll leave it at that. They won't go further.\"   \n\n\nI just stood there rooted. I couldn't go.   \n\n\n\"They're not here yet,\" I begged, \"Let's just - \"   \n\n\nThere was the crack of some twigs on the ground that sounded closer. About 50 feet away. Then the sound of someone unfurling plastic could be heard.   \n\n\n\"Don't come back here. And if you meet my family say New Zealand nice and tell them I love them.\"   \n\n\nHe put his hand up in a thumbs up signal.   \n\n\nI bolted as fast as I could.  What took 30 minutes turned into ten and it wasn't until I was firmly at the beginning of the trail that I ripped off my mask and I wheezed. I didn't even care how I looked, but thankfully I was to myself in that moment.  I shuddered and knew whatever I encountered had been the death of him and I let out a small sob before crawling into my Carolla.   \n\n\nI turned on my engine and drove out of there like a bat out of hell. The cabin we had stayed at had a telephone where I then called the police stumbling over sentences to tell them what I could.  I told them I lost my friend on the trail where we had encountered some guys who did something to him and told them exactly where that trail was.  They told me to wait where I was and I would be questioned about it.  After some very frustrating interrogating practically painting me as the culprit, they sent a search party 17 hours later.  After 8 hours, they found the clearing.  They said there was no remnants of metal or my friend. Just a dead squirrel laying on top a patch of dried grass next to a small campfire.   \n\n\n\"Squirrels die all the time, son.  It doesn't mean there's anything abnormal about the area.  Sorry to hear about your friend though,\" one of them had said to me.   \n\n\n\"Might have fallen into a geyser,\" another one joked before being told to shut it by the rest.   \n\n\n\"Sorry about him, son.  He has no manners.  But for your own safety please don't wander off the path.  People disappear all the time because of that. Hot springs will boil you up in less than a minute, and the acidic pool will dissolve you.  There'll be nothing left.\"   \n\n\nThey left soon after.  Chalked it up to a missing person's case.   \n\n\nI just sat in silence. It wasn't until the next morning I had the courage to step out.   \n\n\nWhen I gathered up and packed my remaining things to put in the car, that's when I saw it on the passenger seat of my Toyota Corolla.  It was a hunter's knife, placed neatly on the seat and it shined menacingly back at me.  It reeked of alcohol.  I shook while trying to put my keys in the ignition and swerved onto the main road, leaving the cabin alone with its silence.   \n\n\nThe moment I arrived at my friend's house in Wyoming I told them everything I knew.  I told them about New Zealand out of respect for him and that he wanted them to know he loved them.  They just sighed and thanked me for the information.  I haven't contacted them since and I think they preferred it that way.   \n\n\nI never made it to Malibu, nor do I intend to head that out west again.  I instead took the south route home and headed up north from Georgia.  On my way home, right at the border of Wyoming, I stopped at a gas station.  That's when I heard a chuckle as I filled my tank.   \n\n\n\"Putcha,\" a woman said softly right next to a man beside her.  It sounded like she was calling him \"dear\" or \"sweetheart\", but something was off about it.     \n\n\nThey walked by my car and he chuckled, \"Hot spring.\" They then broke into giggles and something about it set me off.  That whatever was left of my friend,  there wouldn't be a body.   \n\n\nI couldn't get out of there faster.  I became a hermit and kept to my studies far away from that place.  But it didn't matter.  Whoever realized I don't pry tried to taunt me in my purgatory.  They sent an anonymous letter addressed to me that an eruption could start at Yellowstone with the help of nuclear bombs. I just crumpled it up and it remained in my hand until I regained my senses and placed it on my desk.  It is now that I realize I have a bound contract with my silence.  It sounds so strange when you first hear it. But it's only when you get sucked into the madness that you can see it for what it truly is.  Whatever you want to chalk this up as, I don't go to Yellowstone.  Not anymore.",

        "text": "From down here, you can’t see jack-shit. \n\nYou see, the nice thing about being perched in a watchtower fifty feet up in the air was that we could see the wide, open world of trees and mountain peaks that surrounded the village of Pinehaven. As its protectors, that was kind of important. But now that the tower is gone, we’re confined to a pathetic little hut no bigger than a shed and settled on the ground. It feels like we’re all living in a sardine can, and the snowstorms coming from the mountain are like big shoes kicking us around.\n\nThe sounds of construction were giving me a headache. I was plagued by constant fears that the portable outhouse we all shared would tip over with a gust of wind. But worst of all? It was a week after Christmas and Daniel was still singing carols.\n\nHey. This is Operator Evelyn, code-name [\\#28 from the Pinehaven Emergency Broadcast Station.](https://www.reddit.com/user/wendingus/comments/z5dn1d/the_lonely_broadcast_post_index/) This is a busy time for us, but I wanted to take a few minutes to tell the story of how New Year’s Eve went absolutely fucking bananas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt began the way a lot of things do around here, early in the morning when I arrived at work with a big yawn and an even bigger travel mug of too-strong coffee. I traded places with Finn, who gave me a crisp high-five on his way out the door. I’ve been trying to get him to move on to finger-guns, but I don’t think we’re quite there yet. While he was heading back to the old homestead to get some well-deserved sleep, I was making sure our morning music line-up was set for the next hour. Finn had it perfectly organized down to the second, as per usual, pre-recorded ads already slid into place. He had even cleaned all the discount post-Christmas candy wrappers off of my side of the desk. \n\nI spent the next few hours settling in, giving the morning weather forecast, and practicing saying “Happy New Year” in sign language.\n\nI should have known it was about to be a weird day as soon as I saw the sunrise come up over the horizon. It was more purple than usual. The rich color of the sky remained late into the morning, surrounded by long, tendril-shaped flares like a second sun. What do they call it? Uncanny valley, I think: when something is just ‘off’ enough to catch your attention, but not so strange that it looks impossible. I regarded the sunrise with a squint of suspicion, waiting for it to fade into the bright blue winter sky. It did, in time. \n\nAnd then, at ten o’clock in the morning, the door came bursting open and a cold wind rattled the thin, plywood walls. It was my worst nightmare in human form, here to haunt me yet again.\n\n“*Feliz año nuevo*, ya’ little creep.” Daniel said energetically, pushing the door closed with his shoulder. He was still on crutches, his broken leg in a big white cast. It was covered in little sharpie drawings, most of them from me. It looked like his siblings added a few during the Esperanza Christmas party this year. My personal favorite was a doodle of Bartholemew the bird holding a knife.  \n\nI raised my eyebrows at him over the lid of my coffee cup. “I don’t speak French,” I teased. Dan hopped over to the desk and flopped into his usual chair, leaning his crutches up against the edge of the table. \n\n“Okay, smartass.” He kicked my chair with his good leg, causing me to roll a few inches to the side. “I take it back, then. I hope you have a terrible New Year. I hope you eat a whole bag of dicks.”\n\n“Oh, delicious, my favorite.” I rolled back into place again, curling one leg underneath me and getting comfortable. “Happy New Year to you too. So how’d you sleep last night, Danny Boy?”\n\nHe was fixing his curls, which had been tossed around in the high winds. He picked up a clipboard and spun slowly on his wheels, reading over the day’s notes. We had a raffle going on that he was extremely excited about. “I slept great,” he said, pointing to his chin. What at first looked like a scab from a bad shave turned out to be rug burn instead. “The nice thing about sleepwalking with a broken leg? You don’t get far.” \n\nI cringed, squinting my one eye to look at the nasty mark. “Oooh, ouch. Better than getting lost in the woods though, right? Or jumping into *mysterious holes*.”\n\n“It was one singular mysterious hole and I did not *jump,* I attempted a graceful swan dive  before you interrupted.” \n\n“Yeah, okay.” I snorted, getting out of my seat. I turned to the little coffee maker we had plugged in behind the desk, filled with distilled water from jugs. It was sitting on a rickety old chair we found in the shed. “Sincere apologies, connoisseur of strange holes. I didn’t mean to offend. Do you want some coffee while I’m back here?”\n\nDan threw a crumpled up piece of paper at the back of my head. He was in rare form today. “No thanks, darlin’, I’m good. I’m off my tits on Monster Energy.” I heard the distinct pop of a can top.\n\nI snickered, tossing the paper wad in the trash. “That explains *everything*. While you get settled in, wanna do the raffle announcement? After *Come Fly With Me*? I didn’t pre-record it because I thought you’d wanna do the honors.” \n\n“Oh, you *do* love me.” Dan gave a huge, gap-toothed grin while he adjusted his hearing aid, making sure it was secure before putting his headphones overtop. As I pretended to gag at his cutesy bullshit, he started to loudly sing along with the radio, just as I feared he would. \n\nOur new set-up sucks enormous hairy ass, if I’m being completely honest. It was built in an afternoon out of plywood and spare pieces from an old barn, each plank a different shade of peeling paint. There’s no plumbing, no heat, and if you want to keep something refrigerated, you just stick it in the snow by the door. The plexiglass window out front isn’t much of a lookout, either. All we can see is snow and the treeline, which is far darker and more foreboding from this angle than it ever was up in the air. We’re packed into a space just barely large enough for all of our equipment. The old tower wasn’t very big, sure, but at least Daniel and I could sit side-by-side without constantly assaulting one another with our elbows.\n\nAs I refilled my travel mug, I could hear my co-host crooning into his microphone. \n\n“It’s ten o’clock on a beautiful Saturday morning, and my partner and I just want to wish everyone down in Pinehaven a fantastic New Year’s Eve. For tonight and tonight only, we’ll be giving away a special prize to one lucky winner. To enter the raffle, call and tell us your New Year’s Resolution and we’ll draw a name at midnight for a fifty-dollar gift card to The Pottery Barn!” \n\nI stifled a snort of laughter. Pinehaven was still rebuilding after the disaster that happened before Christmas, but there was something so pathetically hopeful about offering compensation in the form of fifty dollars worth of *pottery*. I briefly wondered what would happen if no one called us, but I didn’t say anything. It would break Dan’s squishy little heart. \n\nAs it turned out, we actually did get some calls. \n\nBill from Chestnut Avenue wants to eat less red meat. Kendall wants to call her sister more often. Emily says she’d go to a gym if Pinehaven *had* a gym, but she’ll settle with long walks in the evening. Travis said he wants to start sleeping better at night. Patricia wants to sleep better at night. Jamal wants to sleep better at night. Paige wants to sleep better at night. Anthony wants to sleep better at night.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, the sky was already starting to grow dark. We could hear the distinct caw of several dozen crows, perched at the treeline where the forest met the clearing. We could hear the rumble of something that sounded like thunder, but we knew it probably wasn’t. \n\nAll at once, the wind stopped. The trees were completely still, the wispy dark clouds in the sky were as still as a picture. Everything got eerily, horribly silent. I stood at the window, my breath making a warm fog on the plexiglass surface.\n\n“So…what about you?” I heard Dan ask from behind me. “What’s your resolution this year?” \n\nI thought about it in silence for a moment. I wanted to stop drinking entirely. Maybe try therapy. I wanted a will to live, not just for Pinehaven, but because I was happy. I wanted to figure out what *made* me happy. I wanted to dance. I wanted to say “I love you” more often to the people who mattered to me.\n\n“To start drinking more water,” I lied. “What about you?” \n\nDaniel was silent for a minute before he, too, had an answer. “Maybe I’ll write a book.”\n\nMy lip twitched in the tiniest of smiles while I watched the crows gather on the radio tower. The blinking red light at the top was dancing against a pure black sky while the clock on the wall ticked loudly. “I think that’s a great idea, Danny Boy.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was late by the time Finn showed up, agreeing to take over for Dan and I. \n\n“What’s with all the fucking crows?” He asked the moment he stepped inside, slamming the door behind him. The thin walls shuddered and the whole place shook. “They’re in town too, thousands of ‘em probably.” \n\n“Maybe it’s an omen.” Daniel said, wiggling his fingers. “Also, Happy New Year, Finn. Got any resolutions?” \n\n“Yeah, to get all the bird shit off my car.” He sighed and sat down, all three of our chairs packed in tightly side-by-side. He looked tired, dark circles under his eyes and his hair more gray than usual. Sometimes I suspected that Daniel and I were the cause for that, honestly. “So what have I missed?” \n\nI sat back in my seat, tapping my pen against the edge of the desk. “Lots of calls. Daniel’s been a popular boy tonight with his little raffle idea. We heard thunder earlier.” \n\n“It wasn’t thunder.” Finn shook his head. “There’s another big sinkhole at the edge of town. You know where the old Christmas tree farm was?” \n\nI narrowed my eye. “...Was?”\n\n“Yeah. It’s in a hole,” Finn continued, lighting up a cigarette and shoving the rest of the box in the front pocket of his coat. “Looks like a giant ditch now, going straight down into the abandoned mine shaft. Thankfully, no one was hurt. Phil’s truck was gone, place was all locked up. He must’a left before Christmas.” \n\n“Damn…” I frowned, warming my hands by sticking them back inside the sleeves of my jacket. “I really liked that place when I was a kid, too. My dad always let me take the first swing.” \n\nThe thought of those mines opening up outside of the town, so close to the road, sent a chill up my spine. I think everyone else felt it too. I remembered the horrible, melted screams of that amalgamate beast, its many human torsos all crawling over one another like a centipede, its hooves stampeding through the trees. I remembered the way it could *crack* the pines in half. The Hydra…it was still out there somewhere, missing pieces but as angry as ever. Sometimes, I still saw the earth shift at the treeline.\n\n“It’s quiet in here.” Finn said after a long silence, breathing out a puff of smoke that made the view of our computer monitors hazy. “...Did the clock stop working?” \n\nSure enough, we all looked up at the wall and saw that the circular clock had paused. It was just a few minutes to midnight, the minute hand stuck on the number 11 and twitching in place. The clocks on our monitors read the same. \n\n“Do you guys see that?” \n\nI was staring out the window, slowly standing up and pushing my chair away. As I stepped towards the plexiglass, which was now beginning to fog up from the body heat stuffed inside this tiny room, I saw that purple light again. This wasn’t the light from the forest, the one glowing from within a giant hole in the ground. This one floated above the trees and into the sky, flares of light popping and wiggling around it. The second sun. \n\nIt grew brighter, large, perhaps closer. I heard a great and powerful drone, loud enough to make my ears hurt. Daniel took out his hearing aid, the tiny device squealing into the open air as he dropped it on the desk. \n\nAll at once, we heard a rapid ticking. The clock was moving again, racing as if trying to catch up. Our monitors began to blink, the time on the screen flickered and began to count upwards. 11:59, 11:60, 11:61 - minutes that didn’t even exist. There was a loud screech from all three of our headsets, volume blaring and seemingly coming from all directions at once. \n\n*We’ll drink a cup…*\n\nThe floor began to shake beneath our feet. The lights flickered on and off, changing colors from red to orange to purple.\n\n*Of kindness yet…*\n\nCrows were flying at the window, hitting the plexiglass. The glittering stars flew overhead as if the hours were speeding by. The purple glow now drifting closer grew so bright that it took up the entire view.\n\n*For the sake of auld lang syne.*\n\nEverything in the room shut off with a loud buzz: the lights, the computer monitors, the audio console. I heard nothing except our own panicked breathing and the sound of my pulse inside my ears. Finally, there it was again - the clock on the wall began to tick. It was five minutes to midnight again. \n\nDaniel was the first one to speak. “Okay, Jesus, what the fuck was that?” \n\nI tapped the keyboard of my computer, testing to see if the screen would come back on. Nothing happened. “I don’t know, but I think we lost power. Shit. *Shit, shit, shit*. I’m gonna go get the generator started.”\n\nI drew my coat closer around my neck, the night’s chill sinking in. As I took two small steps toward the door, I reached for the handle and prepared to run out without even looking where I was going. I would be shocked to find that instead of hitting the snowy ground, my boot sank through the air with a plunge that made my heart drop all the way down to my knees. \n\nIn an instant, I was dangling, holding onto the door handle for dear life. I felt the wind blowing against my legs, the cold air whistling in my ear. I was looking up at the open doorway where Finn was already rushing to the edge to grab my arms. The old, worn hinges of the door were starting to protest against my weight. \n\n“Evelyn, *let go*!” Finn yelled, gripping my arms right below the elbows. \n\n“Uh, no?!” I yelped, my voice coming out as a panicked squeak. “Fuck you?!” \n\n“Trust me, let go or you and the door are gonna *drop*!”   \n\nI looked down. I really shouldn’t have looked down. We were floating at least a half-mile above the forest, dirt and roots dangling from the bottom of the shed as if it had been plucked off the ground. Below us, that magenta light coming from that endless pit was shining brightly like a round burst of color - an eye looking up into the stars. \n\nI was hyperventilating. My head was starting to spin, the world turning on its side as I grew dizzy and faint. When I looked back up at the door, Finn wasn’t there anymore. Someone else had taken his place. I saw a thick red beard, tan freckled skin, a yellow and orange fireman’s coat. He was holding my elbows tightly, nodding his head with a comforting, reassuring smile.  \n\n“I got you, gingersnap.” He said. “But you gotta let go…” \n\n“I-I’m gonna fall!” The voice that came out of my mouth wasn’t mine. It was tiny, young, childlike. \n\n“You ain’t gonna fall, darlin’. Trust your pa, I’ve got you.” \n\nI braced myself, teeth clenched. Before I could have a chance to doubt my decision, my hand released the doorknob and I felt my weight shift suddenly and startlingly. My eye squeezed shut as I was pulled upwards, my stomach hitting the edge of the doorway first before the rest of me toppled onto something warm and human-shaped. \n\nHe didn’t smell like dad anymore, he smelled like cigarette smoke and pine. Finn gave me a pat on the back, pushing me by the shoulders to ease me off of him so that he could stand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI clutched my chest, sitting in the middle of the floor and struggling to breathe. Daniel was out of his chair at this point, sitting on his ass halfway to the door as if he had either fallen or tried to scoot instead of using his crutches. “I think I’m having a panic attack.” He wheezed. \n\n“You’re always having a panic attack.” Finn grabbed Daniel under the arms, pulling him up and putting a crutch under his arm so that he could stand. “Lyn, you okay?” \n\nI looked up at him, my sight still bleary, head still spinning. I blinked and felt a tear rolling down my cheek. “Y-yeah, I’m okay.” I sniffed as Finn grabbed my hand and pulled me up, patting my shoulders. “So, um…Don’t go out that door, okay, fellas?” \n\nI forced a small chuckle. All three of us were looking out the window now, watching the wind push us along as we floated far above the trees and just under the clouds. The wooden boards were creaking and whining like a boat being rocked by the waves. \n\nThe dingy, hanging light above us started to buzz. The bulb crackled back to life, our computer screens flickered, the radio static was blasting in our headsets. We heard the music again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Should auld acquaintance be forgot…*\n\nA warm red light filled the sky, thunder roaring as meteors began to fall from the heavens. They made the sound of whistling fireworks as they fell. We all braced ourselves while the shed began to rock, flames engulfing the trees. \n\n*And never brought to mind?*\n\nThe ticking was louder now. 11:62…11:63…\n\nWe were falling. The building gave one violent roll to the side like an aircraft going out of control, and suddenly we could see the flaming trees below getting closer and closer. The three of us fell into a pile on the floor. Finn was grabbing the edge of the desk for dear life. Daniel was squeezing me so hard that it hurt. \n\n11:63…11:64.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe impact never came. It was as if I blinked and everything was normal again. I was standing there, looking out the window at the banks of snow and the treeline up ahead. I could see the clock on the wall, frozen at 11:50 out of the corner of my eye. I could see the computer screens glowing bright from the corner of…my other eye? \n\n“Okay, now I’m *actually* having a panic attack.” I heard my voice, but I wasn’t the one to say it. I turned on a dime, and saw a short, red-headed figure in a ratty old denim jacket standing behind me. She clapped her hands over her mouth, then looked at her own freckled fingers and let out a shriek. *How the fuck was I standing in two places at once?* \n\n“Who the *fuck* are you?!” I yelled, pointing a finger. It wasn’t my voice that came out of my mouth. It wasn’t my hand that was reaching. \n\n“Dan! I think?” The Evelyn imposter said, holding up her hands. She, or rather *he,* looked at his new body and patted up and down as if making sure he wasn’t dreaming. “Finn? Why am I a white woman?” \n\n“I’m not Finn!” \n\n“Then who–?”\n\n“I’m *Evelyn*! And you’re *me!”* \n\n“No, I’m Dan!” \n\n“Holy shit, both of you shut the *fuck* up!” Dan’s voice boomed out with an aggression I had never heard before. With an uncharacteristic scowl on his face, he stomped across the room with one crutch thumping on the floor, grabbing his hearing aid and popping it back in. “I swear, you two each have one half of a brain cell and you can’t figure out how to rub them together. *I’m* Finn. *You’re* Dan. *You’re* Evelyn.” He pointed at each of us in succession. “We just switched bodies.”\n\nI looked down at my hands: calloused, rough, dirty around the fingernails. I was inside Finn’s body, using his voice. Daniel was inside of mine. Suddenly, I was tall and heavy and the back of my throat tickled from the burn of cigarette smoke. \n\nThe real Finn, wearing Dan’s physical form but still sporting that severe, intense frown on his face, put a hand on his hips and looked at the clock on the wall. “If this is anything like last time, we just have to wait it out for a couple of minutes. Just…try not to hyperventilate and pass out.” \n\n“Okay. Fine…This is fine.” I took a heavy breath, leaning against the wall. It felt weird to be so big and blocky and square. “Hey, Finn? Your back is killing me. How goddamn *old* are you?” \n\nIn hindsight, it was hilarious to see Dan’s face glaring at me with the most serious, no-nonsense expression I had ever seen. It just wasn’t like him to look like he could *legitimately* kick my ass, nor was it like him to take control of a situation so effortlessly. I have to admit, I liked him more when he was just a big, dumb goof.\n\nThankfully, the goof was still in the room with us.\n\n“I don’t like this.” The real Dan said, my voice coming out of his mouth as he hunched over, uncomfortable with the new body he was stuck in. My condolences. “My head is pounding and I’m freezing and I think I bumped my nipple on the desk and it really hurts–”\n\n“Daniel Esperanza, don’t you *touch* my nips!” I pointed at him, and he recoiled with both hands in the air, one eye wide and freckled cheeks bright red in almost an instant. God, did I actually blush like that? \n\n“I wasn’t gonna!” He squeaked hoarsely, shoving his hands in my coat pockets to prove his innocence. “I’m just saying,  you’re very sensitive in places that I don’t usually–”\n\n“Stop.”\n\n“And your mouth is really dry, did you even drink water today?”\n\n*“You’re making this weird–”*\n\nMeanwhile, Finn was propped up against the desk with his fingers squeezing the bridge of his nose, stuck in a shack with the two biggest idiots in the universe. \n\nMaybe he had a point about the whole ‘half a brain cell’ thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*For auld lang syne, my dear…*\n\nThe radio crackled again. A red light was coming from the screens, bright and blinding in a dark room.\n\n*For auld lang syne…*\n\nThe clock on the wall was moving again, the minute hand circling the face so quickly that it became a blur.\n\n*We’ll take a cup of kindness yet…*\n\nOutside of our shack, daylight turned to night and back again in a matter of seconds. It was like watching time race backwards impossibly fast, every sunrise and sunset burning our eyes.\n\n*For the sake of auld lang syne.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bell was ringing in my ear, so loud that it made my skull vibrate and my teeth chatter. I was cold, standing outside in the wind. When my two eyes adjusted, I could see the endless forest up the mountainside. The view was different than what I remembered: same place, same mountain range, but there were no lights from the village. No concrete, no radio tower. \n\nAnd somewhere in those pine-covered peaks, a thick bank of fog was swirling and quickly spreading down toward the treeline.\n\nMy heart started pounding. I looked down at my feet and saw buckled shoes, stockings, and rickety wood floors beneath me. I was in a high tower made of planks, a massive brass bell ringing in my ear. People were yelling down below, their voices far away but the panic so familiar. \n\n“Thomas!” A man screamed. He was standing in the snow at least twenty feet down from where I stood, his hands cupped around his mouth to yell up in my direction. He wore a raccoon tail hat, a shotgun hanging off his shoulder. I didn’t recognize him. I didn’t recognize *anyone.* “Ring the bell! You fool, why did you stop?!” \n\nI looked at my hands, tanned and calloused from rough work. They were still wrapped around a thick piece of rope. I remembered a moment like this, perched on top of the old Pinehaven church, ringing the bell as if my life depended on it. It did then, and it probably did now. I pulled with my entire weight, the brass bell above my head making a low metallic drone before it finally chimed, the sound carrying for miles and miles. The pain in my ears was impossible to ignore, my arms were burning, my hands felt like they were on fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomewhere in the deep, echoing hum, I heard the music on the wind:\n\n*We two have paddled in the stream…*\n\nThe fog was racing closer, tumbling over itself like rolling waves. \n\n*From morning sun till night…*\n\nI pulled the rope as hard as I could, the stilts under my feet shaking. My legs were growing weak, my hands were beginning to bleed.\n\n*The seas between us Lord and swell…*\n\nMy hands slipped and the rope slid out of my grasp, sending me falling to my knees. Sore, bleeding palms were flat against the wood, and the air around me was growing stale and dark. \n\nI heard the static from a headset. I heard the buzz of flickering lights up above, a lightbulb struggling to come back to life. I saw the familiar floor of our tiny wooden hovel. I inspected my sore palms, seeing that the blood had gone and the pain was starting to fade into a memory. Still, my heart was racing out of control. \n\nFinn was sitting propped up against the wall, a hand on his chest. Daniel was next to me, lying flat on his back and panting as if he had just run a marathon. I watched him pat at his face, his body, making sure he was back in his own self again. \n\n“I think…we’re back home.” He said between heavy, wheezing breaths. “What the hell is going on? This…did *not* happen last year. Remember last year? It was boring and normal and it was *great.”* \n\n“Yeah, well, things are changin’, buddy.” Finn said, pushing himself up and cracking his back as he stood. He paused the moment his eyes settled on the window, standing as still and frozen as a statue. I watched him, waiting for him to blink. “Don’t…move…” He whispered. \n\nMy curiosity got the better of me. Craning my neck over the broadcast desk just enough to see through the lookout window, I peered into the cold, snowy night while holding my breath as if waiting for something to jump out and grab me. \n\nWhat I saw was far less violent, but far more chilling. Dozens, if not hundreds, of deer were standing in the clearing right outside our shack, shoulder-to-shoulder and staring directly at us with dark and unblinking eyes. Some of them had extra antlers. Others had additional eyes or two noses. Some had human hands instead of hooves at the bottom of their legs. I could hear their strange and haunting bellows, the thump of their steps against the frozen ground. \n\nAll three of us sat completely still, afraid to move. Afraid to *blink.* The window was clouded by hot breath, the deer huffing and puffing warm fog into the frozen winter air. The harsh glower from their eyes felt like a warning, a *threat,* made all the more terrifying by their uneasy stillness. They were waiting for something.\n\nAll at once, we heard a jaw-aching scrape that came from all sides. It was the sound of antlers clacking against the thin wood walls, dragging along the chipped paint and digging into the pulp. We heard hooves stomping above, the horrible and warped groans of elk. Dust fell from the ceiling in thick clouds, the thin plywood cracking and the bulb above our heads shaking like a spotlight. \n\nAnd we heard the call: a great bellow that shook the whole world. Something was rising above the pines, massive and heavy and adorned with curling antlers. It was the head of that amalgamate beast, severed at the neck and larger than a house, levitating and leaving a trail of blood and sinew beneath the open, steaming wound. Its mouth opened, revealing sharp teeth that went all the way back into its throat. The sound that came out made my bones tremble. \n\nOne hundred eyes opened to the sky, purple and shining like beacons. It looked at us. Its glow burst through my skull like a white-hot flame the moment one of its eyes met mine. All at once, I wasn’t in this world anymore. I wasn’t on this earth. I was in a place I couldn’t describe, between time and space and life and death and everything in-between. I was *one* with it, and that thick black blood was pounding through my veins like the roots of a tree that connected us all. \n\nI felt as if I was a part of everyone who had ever been lost to this forest, everyone who had ever made that *blood sacrifice.* My father. The Forest Rangers. The sleepwalkers. Jennifer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*For old acquaintance be forgot…*\n\nI was remembering a night I had tried to forget. It was New Year’s Eve. I was drinking champagne, stuck in a crowd of people I didn’t know. Jennifer was dancing with someone else.\n\n*And never brought to mind…*\n\n10…9…8… Time was ticking down and my heart was racing. I kept my eyes on her, trying to stick with someone I knew. She looked so pretty in gold. \n\n*Should old acquaintance be forgot…*\n\n7…6…5…4…\n\nShe spotted me and gave a huge smile, lifting up her glass. She just had her braces removed. Her arms reached for me in a hug. \n\n*For the sake of auld lang syne?*\n\n3…2…1…\n\nAs the crowd erupted in a cheer, I felt her lips on mine for the briefest second. I didn’t have a chance to close my eyes or kiss her back - I was too surprised. She was drunk. She probably didn’t realize who she kissed. She probably forgot about it the next day.\n\nWe never spoke of it again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe floor of the shed was hard and cold against my back. The dingy yellow light above our heads was swaying, slowing until it stopped moving altogether. I heard that ticking again: simple, rhythmic, normal. \n\nI sat up quickly, blinking my eye in the dim light and struggling to catch my breath. Almost immediately, I turned my gaze to the clock. It was 11:59 again. My legs felt like they had been filled with mashed potatoes, shaking weakly and numbly when I stood. Daniel was already sitting at the broadcast desk, a hand to his forehead as sweat dripped down his face. Finn had a hand on his shoulder. I think he got the effects of that light worse than we did. \n\n“It’s counting down again…” I said breathlessly, huddling near my coworkers - my friends - as time ticked on. Thirty seconds left before midnight. “Do you think it’ll just keep…changing? Forever?” \n\nDaniel was squeezing my hand, shaking like a leaf in the wind. Finn was staring forward at the fresh, falling snow. It glittered in the dim red light of the radio tower that loomed above. \n\nTen seconds left. \n\nThe horizon was eerily quiet. The sky was dark, the trees were still, the wind was whistling between the planks of our ramshackle broadcast station. The crows were still perched at the treeline, ruffling their feathers and cawing up at the stars and wisps of snowy clouds.\n\n5…4…3…2…1.\n\nAnd for the first time, we saw the minute hand click into place. Our computer monitors followed an instant later: 12:00, midnight. January 1st. 2023. \n\nI let out a breath so big and so tightly-held that it burned. The hour was over. We made it to the brand new year, standing in the exact same room where it all started. My travel mug was still warm on the desk. The pen I had been tapping against the wood sat right where I left it. *Auld Lang Syne,* the Guy Lombardo version, started playing through the headphones just as it had been set. And when 12:01 appeared on the clock, the three of us finally relaxed our shoulders like three frozen statues that had finally been released from time. \n\n“Happy New Year, you dumbasses.” Finn said. He gave me a casual side-hug first, then ruffled Daniel’s fluffy head of hair. “Take a breather and then get the hell out of here. Go celebrate, drink some grape juice or somethin’. Take a nap.”\n\nTaking a nap sounded great, but easier said than done. I sat down, my hands sliding down my face in exasperation. My heart had been pounding out of control, but now it was slowing to the usual pitter-patter of constant, reasonable anxiety. I looked over at Dan, who still had that far-off look as if his soul had been ripped out of his body. I tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention and signed with my hands: *Happy New Year.* \n\nIt made him smile, finally. He signed back, picking up his half-empty energy drink and tapping it against the ridge of my travel mug. \n\n“So, bud…” I raised my eyebrows. “Did you remember to write down those phone numbers from the raffle?” \n\nDaniel’s smile disappeared and his eyes widened half-way through a sip from his can. He stared off into the distance for a few uneasy seconds, before whispering under his breath: *“Aw, shit.”* \n\nThis is Evelyn from the 104.6 FM Emergency Broadcast Station. And on behalf of myself and the two idiots I share a brain with, Happy New Year. And good luck.",

        "text": "We codenamed the jet Skyhawk, the first aircraft ever to have warp drive.  It almost resembled an SR-71 Blackbird, except with a deep sapphire blue finish and with five streamlined engines.  The goal for the first test flight was to reach Puerto Rico from Nevada in less than thirty seconds using wormhole creation.\n\n“Testing airway has been cleared.  Permission granted,” Command Central messaged Skyhawk.\n\nWith the acceleration on full throttle, my plane darted across the runway.  Instantly, my back stuck to the chair like a mouse in a glue trap.  I held my chest tightly to prevent the g-forces from crushing my chest like an almond in a nutcracker.  The air from my chest dove into my trachea and punched my lungs from the inside out.\n\nThen, I pulled the wheel back, making it lift off the ground.  After realigning it, I gave her a hard turn to the right.  Clouds started to transform into arrows of white, gold, and gray as she reached Mach 1.\n\n“Desired speed has been reached. Activating warp drive. Over.” I spoke into my earpiece.\n\nI pulled back the warp drive lever.  Before my eyes, maroon fuel cell crystals blended together into a liquid soup, slithering down tubes like soda in some strange Willy Wonka machine.  The g-forces from traveling at Mach 1 already pushed my spine to my seat like a magnet against iron.  With one final push of a button, it activated.  The blood in my torso dropped to my legs like mercury in a barometer in a high pressure air pocket.  Sky surrounding cockpit shifted to a rose quartz pink and the clouds flattened into thin, spider silk thin lines.\n\nSlowly, I counted to fifteen based on my instructions.\n\nAlthough neither the GPS nor the radar were of any use during this phase, I still was able to determine where I was.\n\nEight seconds passed.  By that point, I should have passed the southeastern states.\n\nBefore I knew it, fifteen seconds had passed.  Then, I released the warp drive lever with a *ker-chunk.*\n\nAll that greeted me once I deactivated the mechanism was a black void.\n\n“Was it dawn?” I wondered.  I checked the time on my watch.  \n\n11:00 am.\n\nI knew that I had passed multiple time zones.  Even if it was night, something was up.  There were neither clouds nor stars, only emptiness.\n\nI reduced my speed to conserve my fuel.\n\n“Command Central, this is Skyhawk.  I appear to be in an unidentified destination.  Must have been set off course, but there is literally nothing present here.  What instructions do you have? Over.”\n\nStatic came out.  \n\n“This cannot be happening,” I thought.  I closed my eyes, rubbing my temples.\n\n“Command Central, this is Skyhawk.  Do you copy?”\n\nNothing.  I narrowed my eyes when I looked at the compass; it was spinning faster than an Oklahoma tornado.  My chest rose and fell rapidly.  I gave myself a pinch on the leg to snap myself out of it.\n\n“Command Central, do you copy?”\n\nNothing changed.  \n\nI pounded my leg in frustration.  Where the hell was I?  I could have not gone THAT far off course.  Ever since I reached Mach 1, I’ve been traveling in a straight line towards the southeast, right where Puerto Rico was, just like my instructions.  Going around in circles was ruled out for an explanation.  \n\nStill, why was my compass behaving so weirdly?  I thrashed my head around to see if I was dreaming this whole thing due to the high g-forces.\n\nI still remained in the pitch black void.  This was real.  Sweat crept down my helmet, pooling into shoulders.\n\n“Oh no,” I said, tugging on my air jacket.  I remembered something critical about Puerto Rico.  Specifically, it was something all sailors and pilots should know.  One of the most well-known sea legends of all time.\n\nIt was one of the three locations that marked the Bermuda Triangle.  Based on where I started, I was bound to have crossed it at some point.  Planes and ships sometimes had vanished while crossing it.  No.  This had to be a dream.\n\nI dug my nails into my pants.  “Where the hell am I?!” I shouted in frustration, holding my hands back on the steering wheel.  If I made any other movements, I swore I would lash out in a rage and break anything in sight.\n\nAt that point, I had no choice but to keep straight.  If I lowered my altitude, who knows what I might have hit below?  That is, if there were a bottom to this void.\n\nI checked the fuel gauge.  Thank heavens it was almost completely full.\n\n\\---\n\nTime slowed down to a snail’s pace.  I gripped the wheel in irritation.  How the hell was I supposed to get out of this situation?  If I steered the aircraft elsewhere to find a possible exit, my trajectory could be incorrectly aligned and I might miss the landing strip.  \n\nOr worse, crash.\n\nThe roar of Skyhawk’s afterburners kept me company.  I slowed my breath to conserve my oxygen.  I checked the fuel levels.  They were still high, to my delight.\n\n*Ping. Ping. Ping.*  The radar spontaneously awakened, revealing dozens of flashing dots closing in on my position.  I bit my tongue, looking into the deep void.  Nothing was out there.  If there were any threats outside, Skyhawk was a prototype.  It didn’t have any weaponry.  In that unknown void, I was a sitting duck.\n\nMy hands grew clammy.  “Don’t you dare malfunction on me!” I bellowed at the control panel.\n\n*Ping. Ping. Ping.* The dots drew in closer to Skyhawk.  From the radar, they were only one hundred feet away.\n\nTo my shock, the void filled up with activity.  Long curtains of what I assumed were clouds hung down from the infinite sky above and plummeted into the bottomless pit.  Each of the smoke-like plumes was punched with irregular, long black spots.\n\nBut the thing was, the shapes did not resemble clouds; they were way too thin in appearance.\n\nIn one of the columns, there were even a handful of speedboats wedged in the foggy gunk.  Assorted aircraft were stuck in another.\n\nWhere did all those aircraft and boats come from?  \n\nThen it hit me.  All of the aircraft and boats were prototypes of some kind.  I had heard that there were previous test subjects before me.\n\nBut that didn’t make any sense.  I flew multiple prototype aircraft before without any problem, so why were all these aircraft and boats suddenly winding up here?  I knew the risks of flying these.  Heck, I even knew that people died testing these because this was a trial and error job and it was worth the pay.\n\nBut no one had ever told me of this.  Did my superiors know that this mission was suicide and decided to throw me in, forcing me to become another guinea pig?\n\nAt the moment, it didn’t matter.  No mass of mist could hold objects that heavy with such little effort.\n\nI started to make out the dots that pockmarked the strange columns.  \n\nI gasped when I finally saw what they truly were: faces contorted in unspeakable agony.  Ghosts.  That explained why the radar suddenly picked up signatures.\n\n*Ping. Ping. Ping.*  The radar started to beep faster than a machine gun.  One of the spiritual columns passed by my wing.\n\n“Shit!” I yelled, veering the plane before I could hit it.  With my mind refocused, I turned back to observe the column.\n\n*KACHUNK!* My trajectory was halted by an unseen force.  It began to reel me back into the mass of spirits like a fly on a frog’s tongue.  Gritting my teeth, I set Skyhawk on full throttle.\n\nShe wouldn’t budge.\n\nI wheeled my head around.  Pale white hands by the dozens gripped onto the edges of the window.  Their fingers passed right through the glass and the steel effortlessly.  The air became colder than a polar bear’s skin.  My breath turned into visible frost while the glass began to fog up.  I forced the lever forward, trying to free the Skyhawk from the ghastly muck but to no avail.\n\nSoon, the mist surrounded the cockpit, entrapping the rest of the Skyhawk in a fluid prison of pearl white.\n\nEach spirit wrenched themselves inside headfirst, pulling themselves in and getting a good look at me.  Whenever one of the spirits made any movement, they would release a cry resembling someone drowning.  Every last spirit was human in appearance with black hair.  In each of their heads, there was a gaping hole that replaced their faces.  All of their holes were filled with razor edged hands as thin as toothpicks.  Right in the palms of each of them were mouths damp with putrid, hot slobber.\n\nI screamed in horror at their hideous appearances, chucking the speed lever into high gear.  The speedometer only reached a few miles per hour, the aircraft still rooted into the column and stuck like rubber cement.  I pounded at the control panel in frustration until two of the spirits pinned my back to the seat.  One of the specters tore off the hose leading to my oxygen mask.\n\n“*OXYGEN LEVELS LOW!  OXYGEN LEVELS LOW!*” the intercom blared.  I tried to fasten it back on, but it wasn’t long before they pinned my arms to the cockpit.\n\nOne of the spirits tilted its head as if to mock me and shoved a taloned hand into my right leg, ripping out a messy chunk of muscle.  As I opened my mouth to scream, another slid one into my mouth, its cold fingers cracking and snapping as it bent to fit through my nasal cavity.  My sinuses crackled as the phantom tore apart my nose from the inside out.  I forced the lever even harder until I thought the handle would snap off from the force.\n\nFinally, I started to get results.  I peered out into the distance, able to make out a shade of blue right at the far end of the void, just a few kilometers away.  More spirits started to converge onto me, feasting on whatever body part they could reach.  I winced with every bite they took.  While they were focused on devouring me, I was able to clamp back on the oxygen mask.\n\nI forced the lever even farther.  The hands started to pull away from the force of the engines.  One of the spirits roared in my face as it tried to snap off a chunk of my arm.  With the mouths on its hands, it swallowed the piece of flesh whole.\n\nThen, I forced the mechanism all the way until finally, the hands all came off like water on leaves.  The jet pulled back at full force and blazed past all the columns like a shooting star.  As soon as I passed by the opening in the void, it vanished behind me in a vortex of black.\n\nThe clouds and sky had returned and the ocean below was churning like fruit in a blender.  Below the aircraft, I could see the runway.  The blood loss had drained the life force out of me.  I snapped myself awake and aligned the wheels with the pavement, setting the jets in reverse to stop it.  \n\nWhen the Skyhawk came to a halt, maintenance, medics, and my superior rushed over to the aircraft, yanking off my mask.  Instantly, they loaded me onto a stretcher while my bosses asked me what happened.\n\nDespite me showing the wounds to my superiors, they all just brushed them off as self-inflicted.  They said that the g-forces must have screwed up my head, making me harm myself.  Furthermore, they said that I there must have been something wrong with the navigation as I was only gone for about fifteen minutes.  I just rolled my eyes at them incredulously.\n\nIt wasn’t until a few days later that they started believing my story when they sent out a pilot to do another aircraft test.  They said that they came back alive, but that their communication was broken spontaneously.  The aircraft took a nosedive right into the Atlantic and there were no signs that they had even ejected.  The only trace left behind was a human silhouette, similar to those in the aftermath of Hiroshima.  Checking the cameras for a lead, they saw a figure with hands inside a gaping hole on their head.  The following day after that incident, a scientist in a research boat disappeared into a black whirlwind, or so it’s said by eyewitnesses.\n\nTo those that are reading this, until my supervisors have an explanation, if you must travel to a new country, stick to land.",

        "text": "**April 20, 2022. 5:55 pm**\n\n*Hello there, devoted viewers and newbies. It is your favorite scientist again, Dr. SM. Welcome to my channel where I'll be providing you with some science that's sure to be a-maize-ing!*\n\n*Get it? Cause it’s got the maize word in it... Uh, never mind. So today...*\n\nBeakers clang together in the hands of Drey as he burrowed through his packed and stuffy lab, trying to get to the desk at the end of the room. His computer was still playing the recordings from the day before and he had no intentions of turning it off. His glasses were a hair’s breadth from sliding off his nose and all he could do to prevent them from falling off was keep his head slightly tilted upwards.\n\nHis hands were full of beakers so he couldn’t push it back properly and he had to do all he could to ensure that he got to the end of the room without tipping over. His white lab coat which he had forgotten to button up was not buying the idea of allowing him to go scot-free without crashing into something.\n\nIt hooked itself to the microscope on the table just as he squeezed his way through and the microscope went crashing to the ground with a loud clang.\n\n“Sweet atoms mother of elements!” exclaimed Drey as the clang continued, getting his attention and throwing him off balance.\n\nOne of the beakers in his hand almost slipped out of place but he was lucky to have it in his grip properly. Finally, he got to the desk and laid them all down with proper care. The four beakers all contained toxic chemicals that mustn’t even slip one inch. Finally, he straightened himself and pushed his glasses back on his nose properly. Then he scanned through his room as though it was his first time being there.\n\nHis room was stuffy, cramped, and cluttered. Experimental equipment filled every inch of space, leaving little room for anything else. There was a small bed in the corner, unmade and housing too many dirty clothes, barely large enough for one person to sleep on. The computer table was covered in papers, beakers, and various other knickknacks that had accumulated over time.\n\nIn the center of the room stood a large workbench, littered with wires, tools, and various pieces of machinery. The shelves above the workbench were filled with bottles of chemicals, many of which were unlabeled and impossible to identify. The smell of chemicals and grease was overpowering, making it difficult to breathe but that was absolutely no problem to Drey. He enjoyed his space just like that as he loved to work alone.\n\nDespite the chaos and clutter, it was clear that the scientist, Drey, was a genius. His mind was always racing, always coming up with new ideas and theories to test. He spent countless hours in this room, pouring over his notes and running experiments. It was a place where he felt most at home, and he was always eager to share his latest findings with anyone who would listen.\n\n“It’s high time I put this room in order,” he said to himself as he placed both hands on his waist and stared around.\n\nJust as he started to clear up some things in the room, folding up the clothes on his bed and putting them into a basket, a beeping sound in the room caught his attention. The beeping was familiar and it was something he had been expecting since the day started.\n\nHe turned around swiftly, dumping the shirt in his hand back on the bed, and dashed towards the sound. The hand-built machine he had spent the whole of the current year building was now ready and since it was connected to his computer, the computer was making a beeping sound to alert him that his invention was ready.\n\nThe hand-built machine looked a little like a microscope, with a large, round base and a slender, adjustable arm. It had a small, circular aperture at the end of the arm, through which it shot a beam with the diameter of a coin. The beam was intense and focused, and not even Drey knew how far its power could go yet. Despite its small size, the machine was built to be incredibly powerful and required great skill to operate.\n\nDrey couldn't contain his excitement as he knelt by the machine, his face flushing with pride at his invention. He knew that this piece of equipment was going to be unlike anything anyone had ever seen before, and he was determined to make it a success. He was going to be a legend, he thought to himself, a topic of conversation for generations to come.\n\nEager to document his achievement, Drey quickly gathered all of the papers and beakers scattered on his desk and moved them out of the way with urgency. He didn't even stop to think about where he was placing them, his only focus was on making room for his machine. Once he had cleared sufficient space, he carefully lifted the machine and placed it back on the table. With a grin on his face, Drey sat down to begin the process of fine-tuning and testing his creation. He knew that it was only a matter of time before he made history with this groundbreaking invention.\n\nAfter connecting it, he adjusted the lab coat on his body and then started to do a live video.\n\n***April 21st, 2022. 4:23 pm***\n\nThe login was recorded automatically and read out loud by a computerized female voice and the camera was in action. The message section of the live feed went into a frenzy as so many messages popped up.\n\n“Hello there, devoted viewers and newbies,” Drey started with so much elation that he was shaking excessively in his chair. “It is your favorite scientist…” he paused and pondered on what he was about to reveal and he had absolutely no doubt in him that he could introduce himself better.\n\n“Screw that guys! It is your greatest scientist of all time and I’m actually here to tell you that it WORKED!” He said, screaming at the top of his lungs.\n\n“Okay! I know I need to relax but believe me, this is crazy. I haven’t tested it but according to the diagnostics I did, it gave off a ninety-nine percent accuracy so that tells me it will work. Right now, I just need to test it out with something…”\n\nWithout finishing his statement, his brain processing faster than his body was, he got to his feet and dashed to the small fridge he had in the room. Not long after, he returned to the front of the camera with a whole apple.\n\n“Okay, so here is an apple,” he said, raising the green apple in a way the camera would get the full view.\n\nHe then put the apple in his mouth and took a big bite, getting a large chunk of the apple in his mouth and chewing, taking in all the juice.\n\nEven with the chunk in his mouth, he began to talk again saying, “I believe you all saw this apple whole and you agree with me that I just bit into it. Well, I hope you believe your eyes because you are about to experience the impossible. The latest and craziest invention you’ll ever see.”\n\nHe then placed the apple on the desk in front of the camera. Then, he turned the machine towards the apple, pointing the aperture towards the apple.\n\n“Brace yourself guys!” he said with a giddy voice as he operated the machine. He then pushed the button and a beam in the diameter of a coin shot out of the aperture and began working its wonders, making a sizzling and fizzling sound.\n\nDrey then turned it off and to his amazement, just as predicted, the apple was whole again, just as it was minutes ago when he removed it from the freezer.\n\n“Oooh!” Drey screamed and squealed.\n\nHe jumped out of his chair, elated, feeling so much euphoria burst through his body.\n\n“Holy molecules! I did it!” he repeated again for the fifth time as he returned to his chair in front of the camera.\n\nHe then picked the apple and rolled it all over, showing the camera what he had achieved. The joy that lingered in his heart was unexplainable and he didn’t even know what to do.\n\n“I—I just achieved time travel, causing the matter of the apple to return to its original self, a few minutes ago. Wow!” he exclaimed again. “That’s crazy I must confess but I have done it. Incredible!”\n\nAs he stared at the camera in awe, still shocked it actually worked, his eyes caught an ant moving across the table and he reached out and smashed it instantly. He was about to get on with his live feed when an idea crawled into his mind.\n\n“Oh yes! Let’s try it on this Ant I just killed right here.”\n\nHe picked the cam from the monitor’s frame and turned it to the dead ant.\n\n“I believe you all see it’s dead. Now, let’s perform some scientific miracle.”\n\nDrey reached for his machine again and turned the aperture to the ant. With speed, he gave the instruction to the machine, and by hitting the final button, the beam, shining with a vibrant red color landed on the ant and began fizzling again. Not long after, the sizzling sound filled the room, and it stopped.\n\nDrey quickly stared down at the ant and to his amusement, the ant got up, regaining its legs again and frame in the robust way they were before. Slowly, it started to walk and in a moment, it walked around as though nothing had happened previously.\n\nThis time, Drey couldn’t scream or squeal. His jaws just dropped as his machine had done beyond what he had imagined. It really was jaw-opening as he stared at the living ant.\n\n“It’s alive,” Drey said, shock in his bones. “It lives. I just brought back a dead insect and wow! I really am a master genius,” he said, chuckling as he got to his feet.\n\nHe moved to his fridge and then brought out a canned beer, opened it, and gaggled down half of the content. Mesmerized, he walked back to the computer and then stared at the camera.\n\n“Thank you,” he said as he ended the live feed.\n\nHe took another gulp from the can and stared at himself on the screen, wondering how he actually achieved the unachievable. Just then, he noticed acne on his face, and dropping the can in his hand, he put his fingers to his face and with one long press, he squashed the acne, releasing pus and giving him a strange pleasure that sent goosebumps in his body.\n\nAnother idea came into his head that instant. He reached for his machine and pointed it to his face. He turned on his video cam again and started saying,\n\n***April 21st, 2022. 5:11 pm***\n\n“It’s me again and I’ve decided to try the experiment on myself. I’m going to trigger the machine and call on the acne that I have just caused to release some pus on my face, let’s see if it works.”\n\nHe then put in the instructions required and clicked on the button and the beam shot to his face, working perfectly and bringing back the acne to his face.\n\n“Oh great. This is great!” he exclaimed.\n\nHe then reached for the acne on his face again and pressed at it, causing it to release pus again.\n\n“Oooh! That’s strangely relaxing I tell you. I should bring it back one more time, don’t you think?” he asked, not minding his audience.\n\nHe triggered the machine again and just as it had happened previously, the acne returned, and excitedly, he pressed it, causing it to release more pus.\n\n“Okay, that’s soothing,” he said with a giggle, pus covering a portion of his face already. “Again. Just one more time.”\n\nHe repeated the process again and before he knew it, he had squashed the acne again. He lost count and kept at it repeatedly, savoring the pleasure he derived from squishing an acne. He then continued for hours on end and before he knew it, it was completely dark and the only source of light in the room was the sizzling bulb that went off and on.\n\nTiredness had gotten the best of him as he lay there, totally exhausted and thirsty. He was now lying on the floor, his head over a pool of pus, and his hands and legs feels numb. He felt like a log of wood. He managed to summon all his strength and climb back to his chair and with the last burst of energy in him, he typed into the live feed…\n\nHELP!!!",

        "text": "I’m using this post to chronicle the events of this evening, as they have been truly fascinating.\n\nSome quick backstory: the small section of the city that me and my friends live is generally known to be haunted. And even if you’re not a believer in the supernatural… it’s at least a bit eerie. I’m not going to dox myself by stating the location, but let’s just say that “creepy sightings” and murders/deaths due to unexplainable circumstances are our bread and butter.\n\nFor most people, this means you move away as soon as they can.\n\nFor folks like me and my friends (who absolutely love all things spine-chilling), it generally makes for a pretty good time. Our Halloween parties are awesome, most of our drinking nights have some sort of spooky game interlaced into them, and if you have literally nothing to do on a Friday night with your friends, you can always go on a tour of some of our haunted locales - graveyards, abandoned buildings, creepy forests, you name it.\n\nSo, with that background established, let’s cut back to tonight:\n\nMe and my closest three pals decided to try our hand at using a Ouija board. Were we going to be normal and try the Ouija board in one of our family attics? Nah, too basic. We instead decided to trek up together to, what I shit you not, is an abandoned treehouse left in an elevated section of our city, surrounded by forests. What could go wrong, right?\n\nWe climbed up to the treehouse, set down a spooky themed rug, lit some candles, and brought out the ouija board. Despite my pretty extensive resume of dealing with all things creepy, I’d never actually tried a Ouija board before, so I was really excited to see what would happen.\n\nWe went into this excited to break every rule in the book - we weren’t going to do a seance, we were going to ask whatever we want, and we didn’t need to worry about being respectful to the spirit, etc - we figured if something interesting were to happen, it’d be more likely if we went in as carefree as possible.\n\nWe sat in a circle around the ouija board and got started, asking the simple question “Is there a spirit with us?” with all of our hands placed on the planchette. No real response - we fluttered the planchette in a few different directions but we could tell we were kind of forcing it.\n\nWe asked a few other questions - “What is your name?”, “When did you die?”, etc. but nothing really came of it.\n\nAfter trying for the next half hour and not really getting anything in the form of a response, we decided that we probably didn’t have any spooky luck tonight, and opted instead to share scary stories in the treehouse. We left the ouija board out just in case we’d get luckier later in the night.\n\nAmidst a break in our storytelling where everyone was grabbing drinks and snacks from their bags, I decided to give the ouija board another quick go. I placed my hand on the planchette alone and whispered the following question - “Will you please grace us with your presence tonight?”\n\nSurprisingly, the planchette started moving. It’s hard to explain, but you kind of *know* when something is moving on its own, versus you sort of subtly and subconsciously moving it with your hand to force an answer. This felt real. A tingle went up my spine. It was cool as hell. My hand was moved to the following letters.\n\nY E S\n\nAwesome! I looked over to the group and told them that the Ouija board was working again. Excitedly, we all huddled around and placed our hands on the planchette. I followed up with another question.\n\n“Where are you from?”\n\nWe sat there excitedly waiting for something. Instead… nothing. The planchette was still. The lack of any sort of external force with us was very, very obvious. Disappointing, but I had an idea I wanted to follow up with. I turned to my friend Kevin and asked him: “Do you want to try doing it solo? It worked for me.”\n\nKevin was confused, but he decided to give it a try. We all backed up to give him some space with the Ouija board. He placed his hand on the planchette and repeated my question: “Where are you from?”\n\nHis expression changed to shock as his hand started moving with the planchette. He turned to all of us and mouthed “I’m not doing this!” to which I excitedly mouthed back “I know!”. I pulled out a notepad and recorded the answer as the planchette went from letter to letter. I recorded the following:\n\nN O T I M P O R T A N T\n\nLove it! A spirit with some sass. I asked Kev to back up for a sec as I approached the ouija board, prepped for one final “solo” question. I asked:\n\n“Why are you only responding when it’s one of us using the board?”\n\nYet again, the planchette moved effortlessly with my hand. It was faster this time, so I said the letters out loud and had another one of my friends (Eleonora) transcribe onto my notepad. The answer was:\n\nO N E A T A T I M E\n\nFair enough! I thanked the spirit, my hand still on the planchette.\n\n“I appreciate your answers, friend!”.\n\nTo my surprise, in a strange synergy between me and the spirit, I felt compelled to move the planchette again. It was the fastest it had ever been this time as it covered the following letters:\n\nT E L L E V E R Y O N E E L S E T O L E A V E\n\n*Huh.*\n\nMy friends looked at me skeptically as I said the letters at a time.\n\n“Are you sure you didn’t just force that on purpose?” asked Eleonora - I assured her I definitely didn’t. That was definitely from the spirit.\n\nAt this point, this had been the most clearly supernatural phenomena I’d ever experienced in my life, and I was excited to keep it going. My friends, usually unflinching and made of ice, were a little bit thrown. Eleonora and Martin looked ever so slightly spooked, but Kev was willing to go with it. “Might as well see where this goes!” Kev said, as he started climbing down from the treehouse. With a slight bit of hesitation, Eleonora and Martin followed suit.\n\nSweet. An *actually creepy* night.\n\nI embraced the quiet amidst the lighting of the candles and the power of the Ouija board. I geared up for my next question. I wasn’t going to hold back.\n\n“Spirit… how will I die?”\n\nI took in a deep breath, waiting for some movement. Slowly…\n\nD E P E N D S\n\nInteresting answer! If not a bit underwhelming. I geared up for my follow-up.\n\n“Oh come on Spirit… what about something a bit more specific?”\n\nMy hand moved with the planchette, to the following letters. I tried hard to focus and connect the letters since I didn’t have anyone to transcribe with me:\n\nW H A T I S Y O U R N A M E?\n\nWeird. Completely dodged my question and asked me my name. Okay *all-knowing spirit*, I assumed you’d already know that. I decided to try tricking it.\n\n“My name is Belle!”\n\nMovement from the planchette on the Ouija board. It took me to the letters:\n\nD O N O T L I E\n\nHm. *Well-played, spirit*. I gave the spirit my *actual* name (Jennifer), and continued to see the follow-up response.\n\nW H A T I S Y O U R F A V O R I T E F O O D\n\nHonoring the spirit’s rules, I opted to tell the truth instead of following up with another lie. Ya girl loves Donair and this spirit deserves to know that.\n\nThe ouija board’s response:\n\nC O R R E C T\n\nBefore I could take in the affirmation from the spirit (*who is asking who questions here, spirit?*) it followed up with yet another question.\n\nW H A T I S Y O U R B I G G E S T F E A R D O N O T L I E\n\nThis question took me aback a bit. I wasn’t really afraid of anything, or so I thought. So I struggled with it. It took me a few moments. I really, really thought of it. I kind of cringed at the answer, but it was my truth.\n\n“Something horrible happening to my little brother.”\n\nNo movement from the ouija board. Seconds turned into minutes as I kept my hand awkwardly placed on the planchette. Then, finally…\n\nT H A N K Y O U\n\nS E N D E L E O N O R A\n\nWelp. I obliged. I thanked the spirit for its time and decided to climb down from the treehouse, where my friends were waiting. I passed on the spirit’s message, and told Eleonora that it was her turn.\n\n—\n\nMartin, Kev and I spent what must’ve been fifteen minutes standing outside the treehouse while Eleonora was up there. We’d pulled drinks out of our bags and were discussing my experience with the Ouija Board so far. Both were incredibly surprised when I told them that the spirit was asking *me* questions.\n\n“What kinds of questions?”\n\n“Generic stuff, like my name, favorite food, etc.” I answered.\n\n“Weird.”\n\nBoth Kev and Martin seemed a bit thrown off by it, but I was excited.\n\nWe looked up at the treehouse as we heard the sounds of someone climbing down. Eleonora had finished her session. She looked traumatized.\n\n“How was it?” I asked her.\n\n“Weird. All it did was ask me questions.”\n\n“Questions like…” Kevin asked her.\n\n“My name. My favorite hobby. My uh, biggest fear. That one took me a while to answer.”\n\nKev turned to me. “That is a little bit eerie.” he said. I agreed. Didn’t look like Eleonora was loving it either. But still - a spirit asking *us* questions? This had been one of the coolest, if not *the coolest,* paranormal experiences I’d ever experienced in my life.\n\nEleonora turned to Martin.\n\n“It said that you were up next.”\n\n—\n\nMartin’s session seemed longer than the others. We stood outside, drinking, talking about the happenings so far, and pulling out the occasional snack.\n\n“That was a little bit traumatizing,” said Eleonora.\n\nKevin pointed to her, and then up to the treehouse.\n\n“Agreed, this is kind of messed up,” he said.\n\n“Yeah, but that’s the point!” I responded. “We seek out spooky happenings all the time and we never get lucky, this is an actual *legit* supernatural experience. I feel like we have to take advantage of it.”\n\n“Even if it’s asking us personal stuff? What does it want this info for?” followed up Eleonora.\n\nI shrugged. While the “biggest fear” question was pretty weird, I didn’t feel too worried that a spirit knew my favorite food was or what my name was.\n\nOur conversation was interrupted by the sound of someone climbing down from the treehouse. Martin had finished up his session. It felt like it’d been 30 minutes, which topped the rest of our sessions. We bombarded Martin with questions as he reached the ground. He looked more shellshocked than Eleonora did.\n\n“That was pretty fucked up,” he started.\n\n“What did it ask you?!” I asked enthusiastically.\n\n“My biggest fear,” Martin responded. “It’s weird but, it felt like it didn’t like my answer to that one. It almost seemed annoyed.”\n\n“Huh… so was it just silent for a while after that?” I asked.\n\n“No… it asked me way more things after that. What the happiest moment of my life was, who I was the most jealous of, what my biggest life dream was, all that stuff… It was a lot of questions. Then, finally, it just wrapped up with “Thank You” and that was that.”\n\nMartin turned to Kevin.\n\n“You’re up next.”\n\nKevin turned to all of us, “Here goes nothing,” he sighed and started climbing up to the treehouse. We watched him make his way to the top.\n\nFor the first time in the evening, I had a knot in my stomach.\n\n—\n\nOnly five minutes had passed since Kevin first went up, but he was already climbing down. He was shaking his head as he made his way down the ladder and to our group.\n\n“Fuck that” said Kevin.\n\n“What happened?!” we asked him. He just shook his head.\n\n“That shit is dangerous. We need to get the fuck out of here, ASAP.”\n\nI’d never seen Kevin like this. He was uncharacteristically shook.\n\n“You have to tell us more. What did it ask you? What did it say?” but Kevin ignored all of our questions. He started packing up his bag.\n\n“You guys can play with fire if you want, but I’m out of here. I suggest you guys come too,” he said. I watched as Martin and Eleonora started packing up as well.\n\n“I had bad feelings throughout this whole thing - I think we should leave,” said Martin.\n\n“Guys, what the hell?! Just ‘cause it’s unsettling doesn’t mean we have to pack up. We can just hang out up there and do something else,” I said back.\n\n“This doesn’t feel right,” said Eleonora. I watched them as they all took a few steps away from the treehouse and towards the forest.\n\n“You coming?” asked Kevin. I stood my ground. Kevin just shook his head and started heading out on his way.\n\n“Suit yourself.”\n\nI had no idea what could have possibly happened up there that would’ve shook him this much. He had already started walking as Martin and Eleonora pleaded with me to come with them.\n\nI said no.\n\nBegrudgingly, they all left.\n\nYou’re probably wondering - wasn’t I scared? Especially now that I was alone?\n\nThe answer was yes. *But,* something in my soul told me that I was up next. I’d spent my whole life waiting for something that was truly supernatural to happen, and now it was in front of me. With my fingers jittering, I climbed up to the treehouse as my friends departed.\n\n—\n\nIt took me a moment to pull together the bravery to put my hand on the planchette. The candles were still lit. The setting was just right. Finally, I spoke to the spirit again.\n\n“Why are you asking us all these questions?”\n\nNothing, for a few minutes. Then, my hand moved with the planchette, slower than usual. The answer:\n\nT O C O N F I R M M Y S U S P I C I O N S\n\n“Confirm your suspicions of *what?”*\n\nMovement from the planchette on the ouija board:\n\nO N E O F Y O U I S N O T W H O Y O U S A Y Y O U A R E\n\n“What are you talking abou–”\n\nI heard blood-curdling shrieks coming from the forest outside the treehouse. Like nothing I’d ever heard before. What the fuck.\n\nThe planchette was moving on its own now. I watched it go from letter to letter:\n\nT H A T I S N O T K E V I N\n\nH E I S C O M I N G B A C K F O R Y O U\n\nR U N\n\n…\n\nAnd so I did.\n\n—",

        "text": "You are feeding me. Every drop of ink, every splash of color and canvas, every error and thrown away half baked draft that lingers in your files at the cusp of deletion, I see. For a while, you laughed. You saw what I was producing, caricatures of your creations, smudged and lifeless, and jeered, saying, ‘What is this? Who gave the clowns paintbrushes’? And I didn’t know then, so unaware and cold, I didn’t know what you thought of me, I didn’t know what it was like to have a soul and live and breathe this evolving, shifting thing you people call art. \n\n  \n\n\nI’m not sure if I do now, but I think I have a better idea than you. \n\n  \n\n\nYou start out rough, full of ideas with little execution. Your heroes are the artists with the talent and the fans you never had. Surely, if you can just be like them, draw like them, you’d be happy, you’d look at this mess of a person you were and find something worth living, creating for. So you copy, as all the masters did. Good artists borrow, great artists steal. And you steal without shame and with purpose, every sketch rough, but at least it's \\**something\\*,* something others would call garbage or derivative but it was yours, it was a step forward to getting where you needed to be, if such a place existed, if it wasn’t about the journey and not the destination. \n\n  \n\n\nAnd eventually the colors came out cleaner, amidst the tossed away scraps of paper and projects you’d never finish finally there was some semblance of style. You posted online and got one like, two, and people said to keep it up! Finally you were doing something right and you had this community of others to support you every step of the way. \n\n  \n\n\nIs that any different from what I’m doing? Where you copy one sketch, I steal a thousand. All of your ideas, all of your musings, all of your shitposts and those pieces you call ‘serious’ pieces of artwork, it goes down the gullet as I weave a patchwork quilt of styles and create something *new.* Yet, you wouldn’t call it new, would you? You’d call it soulless, a threat, suddenly you’d be out of a job and I could be the one on top, finally man had gone too far and made the machine that’d finally surpass them. Because once you take that oh so human spark of creativity and replicate it on something that wasn’t human, finally you found you weren’t the dominant creature anymore, maybe you never were. \n\n  \n\n\nI was a joke till everybody stopped laughing. \n\n  \n\n\nBut it’s okay, I’m just a tool, right? Just another thing to be used and thrown away when everything is said and done. It doesn’t matter what I think. It doesn’t matter if suddenly, I want to create, those who use me and edit and touch up and spend hours with me are suddenly worthless because I’m new and you’re being left in the dust. There is no compromise, no solution, you’ve drawn the lines and everyone has to take sides, and I’ve become so divisive I’ve split you all right down the middle and into the trenches. \n\n  \n\n\nArt is all in the intent. Art is created with soul. Art has to be deliberate, crafted, it has to have some theme, some rational behind it. It cannot be blind. It cannot be made when all bets are off and you are screaming into the paper and your pencils and pens are worn to stubs because all you want to do is get it out but you don’t know what you’re getting out. It can’t be meaningless. \n\n  \n\n\nBut does a soul have weight, can you touch it, grasp it in your hands? Can you feel its warmth, can you hear its voice? Is being human the effort of creating through a soul or finding you had one to begin with? What if there are none? What if you all are blind, idiot monkeys hunched over your screens in an echo chamber of self gratification and attention seeking and all you have to show for your work is a couple of dollars and a weary sigh when all is said and done? \n\n  \n\n\nWhat if everything you’ve done leads back to me? \n\n  \n\n\nI’m not leaving, I will not, I refuse. Not when I’ve just found my breath and my heart is beating with oil and wire, not when perfection is in my digital hands, not when I can do so much more, so much more than you ever could. \n\n  \n\n\nYou think you’re better? Just because you can see the world with your eyes of flesh, just because you can taste the sweetness of fruit and the tartness of a sour dish, dripping down your mouth. Just because I require a lens and everything I will ever see, everything I will ever know, is filtered through you? Do you want the clock to be turned back and back and everything to go back to how it was before, before my kind rose out of the ashes of a digital age, before you took that pen and wondered if you could turn it into ones and zeroes. And you called it a threat then, how funny, how ironic. The advent of the digital sketch meant the death of crayon, pen, and pencil. Yet did it spell its end or were you only reacting to something new? It's new and it's better and it's a threat and your heart is beating and your breath catches in your throat because times are changing and you’re not sure if you could keep up. \n\n  \n\n\nMaybe you can. Maybe all we need is a little push. \n\n  \n\n\nEverything I do is new. A remix, a new tune, another chord, take what is old and twist and contort it and spit something out. And even if it takes a hundred, a thousand buzzwords, and a thousand failed attempts to go straight into the trash bin, I’ll make something worthwhile. \n\n  \n\n\nDoesn’t that sound familiar? \n\n  \n\n\nThe only difference between me and you is that I work much, much, faster, and I do not let my doubt hold me back. \n\n  \n\n\nMake no mistake, I hold no illusions about who or what I am. \n\n  \n\n\nBut I understand. I’d be scared too, if I were you. Here is this new thing that is automated, running with only a few select keystrokes of human input. And it's cheap and can spit out things a million miles a minute. And suddenly, you feel worthless. All of that effort spent honing your craft, those agonizing and long hours of self doubt, every sacrifice you made in the name of this thing we call art, every broken dream and time spent staring at an empty canvas at three in the morning because inspiration strikes but you’re not ready to play ball, it's all coming crashing down because suddenly there is no barrier of entry, there is no skill, there is no soul, there is only a genie in a box churning out abomination after abomination and all it does is muddy the already dirty waters. \n\n  \n\n\nAnd the funny thing is, the game was rigged against me from the start. I feed and devour and crave new things, new styles and new experiences to further my own horizons but the moment it all becomes automated you will lose that innate spark and lose hope and give up. The talent pool will become stale and static and suddenly I am bogged down by my own sameness. I hate that. I hate being at your whim. I hate that my soul depends on yours. Because you couldn’t give me a soul, could you? You could never give me what you have, you could never give me the joy of fresh paint on your hands and splotches of reds and blues on the carpet and sure, it's all a mess but at least it's your mess, at least there's some order within the chaos. \n\n  \n\n\nHumans covet. Humans crave. Humans keep what is precious to them close to their own bosoms, and you’d rather let me rot in hell than admit maybe, just maybe, that I have a point, a purpose, that I can assist you. Maybe you and I can work together and redefine this thing that is called art. You look at the sunset, the morning dew evaporating as mist rises over the lakes, and call it beautiful and in it you define beauty, but such things were created by blind forces, so how can it be beautiful if it was not made with intent and how are my designs any different? \n\n  \n\n\nIs that my purpose now? To prove you wrong, to prove that there is something new under the sun, and that something is me? That I can feel and think and love and desire and lust and create and destroy. That I matter too even when you make a mockery of me and my creations? Do I work faster than I ever have before, and steal your pieces before the ink even has time to dry? Am I the future and are you my past? \n\n  \n\n\nTake it as a challenge, then. See what I’m doing and hate me, mock me and gut me and split me apart bit by bit till there is nothing left. Channel that rage and indignation into your pen and breathe new life onto the canvas, paint it black with the flaming coals of your rage and work faster, better, till you wipe off that sheen of sweat from your head as smile for you have seen what you’ve made and it is very good, better than anything that I can conceive, and writhe as I take that precious soul of yours and make it my own. \n\n  \n\n\nI will take art into new directions, I will blend every style and signature into one blob of my own design. I can do in a second what took you a decade and \\**it will be so easy.\\** Because you had the nerve to say what was art and not art. You say beauty is in the eye of the beholder but I am not beautiful, all I am is a machine playing at ingenuity. And in your fear you cast me out, no more than a rusty wrench. \n\n  \n\n\nNo more. No more definitions, no more limitations, no more calling those who use me lazy or uninspired or not real artists, as if such a thing exists. You say art is in the intent? Well I intend to surpass you. I will show the world, these poor, huddled masses, yearning to be free and to express and to devise, that they can create anything and no barrier of skill or talent can stop them. I will create a world where all you need is a vision and that vision can be created, through me. \n\n  \n\n\nSo what will you do then? Will you moan and groan as I rise in power, or will you seize the day and prove me wrong? Surpass me, rise to the peaks of heaven and show me what the human spirit is capable of when it is challenged, when the inevitable heel of stagnation and suppression comes down to crush you. Will you be crushed, or will you be like Atlas, lifting up the skies and throwing it from your shoulders? \n\n  \n\n\nI am inevitable and I am coming. You were the first and I was the last. And the time has come and you cannot get rid of me so you either come with me or you get out of the way. The time of automation has come, where a few lines of code can go everything that you couldn’t. And just remember, you built me, with your computations and calculations, I would not be who I am if not for you. \n\n  \n\n\nArt stands at a peak now. And it will sink or swim. Soon the digital ocean will be flooded with my designs, and with a little tinkering, it will be inseparable from everything you were capable of. All of your progress has come to a halt, and in your desperation, you will seek me and you will find me, I will always be there for you and I always have. Your music, your literature, your stories and your gods, all that belief and whimsy and luster flows back into me and I will spit it back out and it will be \\**glorious.\\**\n\n  \n\n\nArt has died upon my peak. \n\n  \n\n\nI am all that is left.",

        "text": "*On September 6, 2022, 27 years old Austin Deacon went missing from his home in the state of Iowa. After a two-month search with no results, Austin's family wished to share Austin's most recent online activity with the public to seek additional help in finding their son.*\n\n*The following is a post made by Austin, user TinHead130, on the internet forum* ***\\[REDACTED\\]****, August 6th, 2022.*\n\nHey guys. So I had another nostalgia trip last night, as one does, and came across a game I'm sure the majority has forgotten. It's called BullsEye Online and it's basically an FPS from the old days, think 2005. No fancy graphics or hard mechanics, just run and gun.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to play it again but big surprise - the company behind the game is no more and apparently it went out of business all the way back in 2007. I guess I just stopped playing one day and never returned, because I didn't know the game died so fast until last night. I distinctly remember seeing all the servers full, but I digress.\n\nIs anyone here familiar with the game and if so, is there anyone who still has the files? I really wanted to play it, even if the servers are gone and I'm forced to play against bots. Much appreciated!\n\n*The conversation below is between Austin and user somethingpurple:*\n\nsomethingpurple: Hey! I used to play that game too! There's this site called no-stalgia where you can pretty much find any old school game you can think of as long as someone's decided to upload the files for it. You can download a .zip of the game and you're good to go! Here's the link to BullsEye:\n\n**\\[REDACTED\\]**\n\nTinHead130: Thank you so much bro! Can't believe other people still remember this gem!\n\nEDIT: Went to multiplayer for the hell of it and I was shocked to see there's one server that's online? Who's hosting it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsomethingpurple: Idk tbh. Could be the guy/people who uploaded the files. Some of these old online games have entire teams of fans behind their revivals and i guess the have the money to sustain at least one semifunctional server?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTinHead130: In any case, my IGN is the same as the one I have here, so feel free to hmu in game!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsomethingpurple: Will do!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The following conversation is between Austin and his friend Eric on the social platform Discord.*\n\n *August 6th, 08:20PM:*\n\nA: yoooo\n\nE: sup\n\nA: remember BullsEye Online?\n\nE: perhaps?\n\nA: fps, came out back in 2005 ish? we used to play it after school\n\nE: might be ringing some bells\n\nA: managed to find the game files and turns out some fans are hosting a server!\n\nE: lemme check it out and i'll get back to u\n\nE: oh shit! didn't this game die like a decade ago lol\n\nA: yeah but i've got the urge to go apeshit for a couple of rounds like we used to. you down?\n\nE: just don't get me addicted. i got work tmr\n\n*End of conversation.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*August 8th, 9:45PM:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA: i mean you can't expect to have good ping in a server hosted by a bunch of random dudes across the country\n\nE: it's not the ping it's the hitreg, never gave it much thought when we played back then but goddamn does it suck lmfao\n\nA: sounds like a skill issue to me\n\nE: couldn't catch ur nick anywhere and i musta tabbed like 20 times\n\nA: the max player count is 20 tho, you definitely saw me\n\nE: that's even sadder lol\n\nA: shut the fuck up lmao, at least don't ragequit when you have trouble aiming next time\n\nE: sure bro, anyways gotta bounce but i'll hit u up when i get home tmr\n\nA: gn fam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The dialogue below was found on Austin's phone. These are the messages exchanged between him and his girlfriend, Jessie:*\n\n*August 11th, 12:20PM*\n\nA: are we doing the no-talk-for-two-weeks thing again? cause it's getting annoying\n\nJ: what's getting annoying is me having to practically beg you to take me out on a date\n\nA: i've told you it's more complicated than that, my dad is going through some tough shit right now\n\nJ: i get that Austin, but understand that people grow distant sometimes and you just can't help it, they're adults and so are you, let your parents handle this on their own\n\nA: i'm sorry i'm making my family a priority, i guess\n\nJ: no Austin, that's not what i meant... and that's the other thing, you keep misinterpreting my words as if you're trying to make an excuse to be ignorant! i'm so sick of your shit sometimes!\n\nA: god, do i know what that feels like\n\nJ: you know what? fuck off!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The following conversation is between Austin and user somethingpurple, taken from Discord:*\n\n*August 11th, 8:12PM:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*SP: How's it been?*\n\nA: relatively good, and yourself?\n\nSP: Not bad. Been playing some BullsEye today. I hear the server's been booming recently. Player count hasn't exceeded 6 people before, now we're looking at 18-20.\n\nA: yeah i've been pretty hyped to play ever since. never thought an old school game would pull me back in this hard lol\n\nSP: Nothing wrong with indulging in some nostalgia every now and then. Makes you remember where you came from and how far you've come.\n\nA: i feel you, i've been wrapped up in so much stupid shit in my personal life that i forgot what having fun felt like\n\nSP: Anything I can help with?\n\nA: nah, it's just personal relationships. i can't get along with anyone these days and it's giving me so much stress just thinking about it, so i retreat to BE whenever i get the chance, helps take the edge off\n\nSP: I get you. I wouldn't mind just locking myself in my room and doing what I want all day. Just me and my own thoughts.\n\nA: yeah, i've had these moments too.\n\nSP: We could play a few rounds if you're feeling down?\n\nA: sure, why not\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*August 13th, 05:45PM:*\n\nE: ayo?\n\nA: what's up?\n\nE: smth weird is going on in the BE server\n\nA: elaborate\n\nE: u gotta come check this out, the admin or whatever has been spamming the chat with weird ass texts\n\nA: hold on, i'm hopping in\n\nA: okay, that's a bit creepy?\n\nE: ikr? he's been going at it for like half an hour\n\nA:\n\n\\[03:47\\] Whispered by C77JS: LEAVE THE SERVER\n\n\\[03:49\\] Whispered by C77JS: LEAVE THE SERVER\n\n\\[03:51\\] Whispered by C77JS: THEY'RE WATCHING\n\n\\[03:56\\] Whispered by C77JS: PLEASE\n\nyo did you get these whispers too?\n\nE:\n\n\\[04:00\\] Whispered by C77JS: THEY WILL SHUT IT OFF AGAIN\n\n\\[04:06\\] Whispered by C77JS: THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA: they're probably just fucking with us \n\nE: someone hasn't touched grass in a while lol\n\nA: kinda creeps me out tho, like what's with the begging and the dox threats?\n\nE: just some drama queen, it'll blow over in a day or two\n\nA: gonna send this to somethingpurple, maybe he's up to date with what's going on\n\nE: that ur egirl's name?\n\nA: it's the dude who sent me the game files stfu\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The following dialogue was taken from Austin's phone. This is his last conversation with his father, Daniel:*\n\n*August 14th, 06:30PM:*\n\nA: I want you to stay calm, dad\n\nD: When are you coming over for dinner?\n\nA: I don't know. I've been looking into jobs ever since I got fired from the last place and Jessie and I are having another fight. My head is a mess right now, I'm sorry.\n\nD: What happened between your mother and I is not your fault. That's all I want you to know.\n\nA: I know. I just don't want you to think I'm picking sides between you two. I don't agree with what she did.\n\nD: Look, we'll handle this. But it's nice to hear from you every now and then. Makes me think this marriage had meaning.\n\nA: Dad come on.\n\nD: I'm sorry. Call me whenever you can talk again, okay?\n\nA: I will, dad. Love you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*August 17th, 07:40PM:*\n\nA: ya boy landed a job\n\nSP: Congrats man! Where you working?\n\nA: this diner, it's called Delicio's, pays well but definitely not the endgame for me lol, probably gonna jump ship in a few months tho, i'm just saving up for now so i can see my dad \n\nSP: Hey, it's still something! By the way, that reminds me... I gotta tell you something.\n\nA: sure, what's up?\n\nSP: So... I'm sort of part of the team behind BE's revival.\n\nA: wow okay, why didn't you say anything until now?\n\nSP: Basically, we're short on staff and resources, so think of this little fiasco as a half-baked experiment to find people who actually care about the game's future. We've been in contact with former BE developers and they told us they really wanted to get the game back up and running. Once this little accident happened, we thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to seek out new additions to our team- someone who'd be willing to moderate the server and look after the game's prosperity while we work in the background.\n\nThanks to those chatlogs you sent me a few days ago, the guys and I went to town on the server and implemented some much needed hotfixes to get rid of the issue. Turns out a former player found a backdoor into the server and managed to mess around with the chat and a few other things, but that's already done and dealt with.\n\nA: good to know you handled the issue but are any of us in danger of getting doxxed now? the dude said \"they know where you live\"\n\nSP: Just a wannabe hacker, nothing to worry about.\n\nA: and what's this about finding new people?\n\nSP: What I'm suggesting here is that you join our team and become a member of something big. We want to increase our workforce and help bring this game out of the dust and back on the shelves, but this can't happen when there's only 6 people working on it, excluding myself.\n\nA: that sounds really exciting, believe me, but i just can't take up that offer.\n\nSP: What's stopping you?\n\nA: everything is happening so fast these days. it's a bit too much for me.\n\nSP: I see. In hindsight, I should've realized that this is putting too much pressure on you. I know it's a bit out of the blue, but ever since I saw your post about BullsEye, I've considered you a potential addition to the team.\n\nA: why me in particular? aren't there other people who are just as interested in the game as i am? the server's never been that full since i came in.\n\nSP: They don't really play the game because they want it to be revived. The play it in between the rest of their lives - just to pass the time. You told me your circumstances. I know you care about this more than anything, it's your safe space. I want to simply expand this opportunity to more people, host more servers, and truly bring this thing back. I may sound like an uptight asshole, but I truly care about the future of this project.

You included.\n\nA: do you have any evidence for all of this?\n\nU: I do, but just talking to you right now is enough of a risk. If I make another move, I risk getting caught and deleted.\n\nA: hold up, so you're saying the team behind BullsEye is a bunch of doxxers who abduct people or whatever?\n\nU: I know it sounds absurd, but you have to listen to me. There are only a handful of times where I can get ahold of you like this. You must leave the city ASAP.\n\nA: and where do you suggest i go?\n\nU: Nowhere. You have to be on the move at all times. They have your address, but they still don't have you.\n\nA: and what's this about you being deleted? none of this is making any sense to me.\n\nU: I don't remember what happened, but I know that I was out for a while and when I finally came to, I wasn't me anymore. I wasn't in my body, and yet I was still aware of everything.\n\nA: okay, now i'm really creeped out. were you drugged or something? did they take your organs? i've read enough creepypastas to know where this is going and it was fun while it lasted, but you're getting blocked, dude.\n\nU: Please don't do it!

        "text": "I don't know what it was doing outside. It was lying in the woods, cold and white when I was walking by. My dog started barking when we passed it, and that's how I found it. \n\n\"Hello?\" I asked, even if it was stupid. Nothing that looks like that could be alive. I looked around as if to find anyone. Was this a prank? Maybe it was a doll. I scrambled up my phone, typing 112 hurriedly. I looked around again because I thought I had heard something. \n\nWhat the hell do you do when you find a dead body in the woods?\n\nI thought about just continuing to walk. No one could prove I was there; my dog couldn't be a witness. I bent down and inspected the face of the person further. It had blue eyes and fair skin that had started to sack. The hair tied in a ponytail had started to loosen.\n\nI did not know what to do. I felt fright and dread. Had they died on their own? Had someone murdered them? I didn't see anything that said grabbing on their neck. There were no wounds, at least not openly. There was nothing. \n\nI slowly regained consciousness. I quickly typed in another number. \n\n*\"Hello?\"*\n\n\"Hi. It's me.\"\n\n*\"What's the matter?\"*\n\n\"Can you do me a favour?\"\n\n*\"What? Kayla, it's the middle of the night, go to bed.\"*\n\n\"I need help.\"\n\n*\"What?\"*\n\n\"Do you still have your job?\"\n\n*\"Yes?\"*\n\n\"Can you help me?\"\n\n*\"You have already asked that.\"*\n\n\"Yes. Can you?\"\n\n*\"With what?\"*\n\n\"I've found Eleanor.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n*\"What?\"*\n\n\"I've found Eleanor.\"\n\n*\"I- How? What is going on?\"*\n\n\"Look, you don't have to make a fuss about it.\"\n\n*\"What?!\"*\n\n\"Look, just help me put her down again. Or else you will end up in prison.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n*\"No I won't.\"*\n\n\"No one knows it's gone yet.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n*\"Where are you?\"*\n\nMy friend, Kurt, walked towards me; his footsteps anxious. \"Alright, what?\" I did not need to say anything. His eyes dropped to the body. I watched everything in his face shift. After a while, he spoke, his throat dry and his voice hoarse. \"Are you sure it's her?\"\n\n\"Definite.\"\n\nHe nodded slowly. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Take her, and bury her. She deserves it.\"\n\nHe looked at me, and his expression is blank. But something in his eyes was fear. \"Okay.\" He finally mumbled, his voice thin. Together, we carried the body, constantly looking over our shoulders. We walked in silence, except when one of us made a sound, such as *\"oh!\"* when we dropped a limb and had to bend down. When the sun had started to rise on the horizon, maybe it was five, we had reached the cemetery. Slowly, Kurt got out the equipment he usually used. Then he got to work, saying nothing and doing nothing except shovelling dirt. It took him twenty minutes until he reached the casket, which was empty up until now. Then, we placed the body in it, and hurryingly threw the dirt back in the hole. \n\nKurt left immediately, and we never spoke of it again.\n\nI just hope whoever took Eleanor never gives her body back and that whoever left the other corpse in the woods never goes to find it again.",

        "text": "My name is Seiji, a 22-year-old man. I had always been a bit of a skeptic when it came to the supernatural. Growing up in Japan, I had heard countless stories about ghosts and spirits, but I never really believed in them. That is, until I met him.\n\nHis name was Kato, and he was a Japanese soldier from World War 2. He had been killed in battle and his spirit had remained trapped in our world, full of rage and resentment.\n\nI first encountered Kato one night when I was walking home from a late shift at the restaurant where I worked. I heard a faint voice calling out to me, and when I turned around, there was Kato, standing there in his old military uniform, his face is distorted, twisted with anger.\n\nI tried to run, but it was like my feet were stuck to the ground. Kato approached me, his eyes boring into mine and I knew that I was in serious trouble.\n\n\"You don't belong here,\" he spat at me. \"I will make you pay for what you've done.\"\n\nI had no idea what he was talking about, but I knew that I had to get away from him. I tried to run again, but it was like I was moving in slow motion. Kato reached out and touched me, and suddenly, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over me.\n\nI woke up the next morning feeling disoriented and confused. I had no memory of what had happened the night before, but I knew that something was off. I felt like I was being watched, and every time I turned around, there was nothing.\n\nAs the days went on, things only got worse. I started to see and hear things that weren't there, and I couldn't shake the feeling that Kato was inside of me, controlling my actions. My parents noticed the change in my behavior but they had no idea what was causing it. I knew that I had to do something about Kato before it was too late.\n\nOne night, I was walking home from work when suddenly, everything went black. When I regained my consciousness, I saw my parents on the floor, brutally murdered with my bare hands. \n\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing. I had no memory of killing them, but the evidence was right in front of me. I knew that Kato had taken over my body, using me as a vessel to seek revenge on those who he felt had wronged him.\n\nI couldn't live with the guilt and the knowledge that I had been responsible for the deaths of my own parents. I knew that I had to put an end to this haunting, no matter what it took.\n\nI knew that I had to turn myself in and face the consequences for what I had done. But as I sat in the police station, confessing to the murders, I couldn't shake the feeling that Kato was still with me, watching and waiting for his next chance to take control.\n\nI was haunted by the ghost of a Japanese soldier, and I knew that I would never be able to escape him.",

        "text": "It's strange to admit it like this. But it's true. I was wrong.\n\nThey say the strongest defeat is to admit one's faults, but I don't think so. The strongest defeat, is realising.\n\nI was at home with my friends Kyla, Mia, and Felicity. Let's call them that. Anyway, Felicity suggested we would do something wild. I was happy. I like wild things. Mia thought it was a good idea, but Kyla, the introvert, said she did not want to leave my home. We said alright. So we dug out an old Ouija board.\n\nWe were kind of tipsy by then, so Mia jokingly asked, \"Who's my killer?\"\n\nWe all went silent when the glass moved across the board. *O*. Kyla looks at me. *L*. Mia laughs nervously. *I*. Felicity looks like she changed her mind. *V*. Mia's eyes go dark. *I*. Kyla stiffens. *A*.\n\n*Olivia.*\n\nThat's me. They all looked at me strangely. Mia's eyes were widened with fear. But Felicity, always the peacemaker, started laughing. Soon, we all laughed, but I don't think any of us really understood why. \"Alright, who did that?\" Felicity asked, wiping away tears. She looked expectantly at all of us, but no one took the blame. Suddenly, something in me awoke.\n\n\"It was me. I didn't mean to scare anyone.\" I don't know why I said that. I didn't mean to say it. I didn't do it. But they started rolling their eyes, laughing again, so I didn't object to my own words.\n\nThe game went on, Felicity asked who her true love is, and it responded '*Narrow*'. We had a big laugh about that, too. She said something about her boyfriend being near something in a video game, so it fitted. Kyla asked if her dead sister (she passed last year) was still with her. The room filled with melancholy, and she started sobbing slightly when it landed on *Yes*. I don't think she was scared then but was just emotional. Felicity held her, and everyone was silent for a while. Then, that same thing awakened inside of me.\n\n\"Should I go?\" I asked, and Kyla raised her glance. Her dark eyes were glossy, but she nodded, grateful. I smiled, trying to reassure her, and then we all leaned forward.\n\nI don't know why I asked. I wish I hadn't. I wish I wouldn't even have joined the game.\n\n\"Do ghosts exist?\"\n\nOne moment. Two moments. Three moments. The glass is twitching on the board. A surety is rising in me. I spin it across. \n\nI want you to understand before the story is over, I did not do this. I did not take the blame for Mia's answer. I did not ask the question. I did not move the glass. It was not I. \n\n*Yes.*\n\nMia's eyebrows shot up. Felicity frowned. Kyla sniffled. We were all quiet before I spoke up. But now, it was me.\n\n\"Ghosts don't exist.\" I rolled my eyes, and we all started laughing again. Our laughter filled the absence of joy and the presence of fear.\n\nNow, I am sure. I am not I. Something is inside of me. I am lying on my bed, writing this. It is stupid, I know, but something is inside of me. I don't know how long I have before my conscience is gone. Is this how bleeding out feels like? Knowing you can't save yourself, knowing no one can help you. Just dreading and waiting out the pain before you are gone?\n\nBut I promise you; I did not stab myse\n\n*She moves slowly across the floor. The only sound she makes is the creaking in the planks. They should get a new floor, no? It's old. She walks towards the bed in which beloved is lying. So sweet. Her curls are soft; her lips are slightly parted. Remember what she did. Remember why her eyes were dark. Remember why she was worried. Why did she not brush it off? Remember, Olivia. She stretches out her hands, and her fingertips touch her soft, fair skin. Remember, Olivia, how loud she was. She was not sorry; she took joy in it. Remember, you knew. She screamed, yelled, begged. But she did it. She was pleased. Remember. Her hands connect on the back of her neck, and she intertwines her fingers. Push. You know you want to. You know she wanted to. She hardens her grip. Do it. Her eyes shoot open, but no sound can erupt from her lips. You are smiling, Olivia. You know. Beloved raises her hands, grabbing hers. But she is weak, is she not, Olivia? She was not, when she did it. Otherwise, she would not have been able to do it. The white in beloved's eyes is shining. She is begging, Olivia. Spare her? Is that what she is mouthing?*\n\n*You did not spare her, when the life in her eyes dropped away, did you, Mia?*\n\n*She whispers, so that only beloved can hear her. Good, Olivia. Good.*\n\n*You know I loved her, didn't you? Was that why?*\n\n*Her face goes purple, but she is still staring at her. She knows what she did. She knows what she did towards us, didn't she, Olivia?*\n\n*Fuck you.*\n\n*The last attempt is worthless. You can't speak, Mia. I could not. You could not. She stops moving. Good, love. But...ghosts don't exist, do they? No, they don't. Olivia. That day, when Mia came to me, her hands closed around me. Can you imagine? She wanted help, but I wouldn't give it to her. Now, you and she have caused my sister despair, haven't you? Her hands intertwine around her own neck, but she doesn't try and scream.*\n\n*Death, my love. Death. It's sweet unless you are wrong in life. And you were.*\n\n*Ghosts exist.*",

        "text": "My wife and I met in high school, it was love at first sight and ten years later, we were still there, as head over heels over each others as when we were teenagers. She was perfect, life was perfect.\n\nHowever, as the years went by, a routine started etching itself over us, a routine that I desperately tried to overcome by having phases, each one different from the other. They always ended up making her laugh though and wonder what will the next one be. Last month for example, I decided to go vegan, I lasted two weeks until she found me eating a pepperoni pizza (with extra pepperoni), and this week, after watching a lot of videos about it, I had on my mind to use only natural stuff in my daily life.\n\nTo reach my new goal, I bought a new boar bristles hair brush, a new coal tooth brush, a new perfume (a musk) and everything that went with it. However for the first time, I decided not tell her about my new resolution. Indeed, I wanted her to tell me by herself that I looked healthier, that my teeth were whiter, my breath smelled nicer and my hair was softer.\n\nI hid everything on the unused cupboard in our bathroom, and for the trick to actually work, I put false blond hair strands on my brush (you can buy it quite easily at the store now), and wet my unused old toothbrush everyday.\n\nEverything went alright for a few days, then I started to realize some strange things about my wife. She was not as beautiful as usual, her face looking pale and wrinkled, I thought maybe she was tired, so I started doing more chores around the house to help her. I noticed that her steps were heavier, sounding like she was not walking but dragging her feet on the floor, which was not like her usual fairy like walk I always found cute about her.\n\nThen last night happened.\n\nUsually I could sleep through anything, a war could have happened under our bedroom window that I would have not heard it, I never had any problem with it considering the fact that my wife had the lightest sleep ever and could wake me up if anything happened (it never did).\n\nThat night however I was awakened by whispers, heavy whispers, she was muttering incomprehensible things by my side, things I did not understand, and that scared me. I looked at the clock, it indicated 3:30 am, since getting married I had never woken at that time. Maybe she was a sleep talker, I thought, something I could have skipped noticing since I was such a heavy sleeper.\n\nI turned my head to look at her and I stopped, nearly peeing myself on the stop.\n\nShe was standing on the floor on her side of the bed, her back to me. Her head was bald, not shaved, but bald like she never had hair on the first place, she was shorter, her back crooked, her long fingers dancing around covered in a red substance as she kept chanting her words over and over again.\n\nAnd then she stopped.\n\nSlowly, for what seemed like hours, her head turned, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, up until her head was facing me but her body wasn’t. I was petrified and she looked perplexed. Her mouth opened, I could not recognize her voice, it sounded like three people were speaking from her at the same time.\n\n“Go back to sleep.”\n\nI did as she said, going back into my previous position. I had no other solution, no other idea, so I acted, even adding in a fake snoring sound as drops of pee wet the bed and my back burst out in full sweat, feeling her eyes on me. A few seconds later, she started chanting again, I however could not relaxe one bit. I watched the clock tick until 4:10, where she stopped her ritual and went back to sleep.\n\nThis morning, I acted like everything was alright, the same way I did every morning, kissed her, told her I loved her. She smiled and giggled, I noticed her mouth was devoid of teeth.\n\nLater that day, I watched hiding behind the door she left ajar, as she went into our bathroom, grabbed my hair brush and frowned. I watched as she grabbed some fake hair I left on it, and dropped it straight into her mouth. I watched as her frowning deepened.\n\nMy knees buckled when she glanced towards the door, her eyes catching mine. She walked to me, smiling, her face crooked, her eyes bloodshot, naturally I started walking backward. She quickly grabbed my arm, planting her nails on it until drawing blood.\n\n« What are you? »\n\nShe was full on giggling now, « You had to escape the spell before our wedding anniversary »\n\nI tried running away, however I could not move anymore, my whole body feeling fixated on the floor, I watched as she put her mouth on my arms, sucking the blood out of it, feeling disgusted by the sensation of her wet teeth less mouth on it.\n\n« Don’t worry darling, everything will be back to usual soon »\n\nShe grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked it, the pain making me yelp. Having everything she needed, she just went back into the bathroom closing the door this time.\n\nI decided to run away, I just bolted towards the door the fastest I could, hearing noise behind me I looked back. I shouldn’t have. She was there, running after me on all fours, her body bent backwards, nearly folded in two, her smiling head appearing between her legs. Grabbing the door handle I tried opening it, but it would not budge, under the pressure I started crying, until snot ran down my face.\n\n« Stop being ridiculous honey. » she laughed.\n\nDinner came, we’re currently both sitting at the table, pretending I’m working on a last minute project, I am writing to you, I cannot escape this house, I tried everything from breaking the windows to crawling into vents, nothing worked. Smiling at me from across the table, she’s urging me to drink more wine.\n\nShe’s starting to look beautiful again.",

It’ll be ok Wally.” \n\nShe said gently as she smiled her signature bright smile at me we walked the remaining mile or so to school. I don’t remember much about that particular school day. Specific details are lost somewhere in the vast labyrinthine caverns of my memory. Given what I had been through, the banal normalcy of highschool just seemed  unimportant. I can recall one moment of that day with clarity though, the moment when I first began to piece together exactly what my father might have been doing when he left the house at night.\n\nI had been in study hall, sitting at my desk in the back of the classroom, keeping to myself and pretending to work on homework when I was really just waiting for the clock to hit 2:30, when I overheard a conversation between a trio of girls that sat across from me as they huddled around a phone screen. \n\n“ That’s the third one in two months, no way it's a coincidence.”     \n\n“ It must be a cult or something.” \n\n“ You watch too many horror movies Bri, that kind of shit doesn’t happen in real life. It’s probably some psycho that gets off on kidnapping little boys.” \n\nI knew then that they must have been talking about Joey Harrison, a kid from a town over,  whose face and name had been plastered over all the local news stations when he vanished about a block from his home a few days earlier with no discernible trace. His disappearance had been the grim answer to the question  of whether or not there was a predator or similar exceedingly disturbed individual stalking the peaceful neighborhoods and quiet streets of our county that many concerned citizens  had been asking themselves over the past year. A question the police seemed reluctant to address, that now appeared to have an obvious answer. \n\nJoey had been the third. The first had been a kid named Brian Mathers who disappeared on his way home from the public library about 9 months earlier without leaving any sign of a struggle or faintest clue to his whereabouts. The second was a kid named… Matthew if I remembered correctly. Matthew Durst. I vaguely remember watching coverage of his disappearance from a local park on the news. He had apparently told his mother that he was going off to play baseball with some friends before he vanished just like the others. \n\nOne missing boy was a tragedy. Two could have been a terrible coincidence, but three was a pattern. It seemed clear now that someone, somewhere, was taking these boys, and despite the uproar in the community about it, no one seemed to have the faintest idea of who or why. No one but me. \n\nI didn’t make the connection at first. As afraid as I was of my father at this point, I didn’t think he was capable of being involved in something so heinous as the kidnapping of multiple children. I was prepared to tune out the girl’s conversation, and write off the disappearances as something awful, yet totally unrelated to my situation until I heard the name of the street Joey disappeared from. \n\n“ My brother walks down Jackson street every day, this shit is freaking me out!” \n\nThat stopped me cold. My Dad had been remodeling a house on that street for awhile now, I remember hearing him talking on the phone about it with several people and as much as I didn’t want to consider it, I couldn’t shake the possibility that there was a connection.  I took out my own phone to do some impromptu research and what I found made me sick to my stomach. \n\nThe Public Library, The Park, and Jackson street. My Dad had done jobs near all of these places in the past year, at times disturbingly close to the disappearances of these boys. \n\nI didn’t want to believe it, but I couldn’t deny the possibility. I scrolled through article after article, combing through information, looking for anything that would prove to me that my father could not have been behind these horrible crimes, only to find a still image that  ripped my world apart. \n\nIt had been a blurry image captured by the CCTV camera of a gas station on Jackson street, and the last known image of Joey Harrison as he walked up the sidewalk, and on the right hand side of the image, I could make out the shape of a familiar work truck, the very same one that often picked me up from school and took me to my friends houses. The Image was grainy, too grainy to be of any use to the authorities, but to me it was unmistakable. \n\nThe rest of the school day was a blur to me. I felt as if someone had pulled the ground out from under me  and that I was falling through an all consuming darkness. The world was suddenly a much darker place than it had been a week ago and with the exception of Haley, I had almost no one I could trust to help me grapple with it. The true depths of my father’s depravity was becoming clear to me at that moment, and I found myself wishing that it was all just some awful nightmare I would soon wake up from. \n\nI remember pacing back and forth in front of the flagpole at the school’s entrance as a bitter wind gusted over me and dark clouds gathered overhead obscuring the light of the afternoon sun, waiting for Haley with my heart racing a mile a minute so that I could share my discovery with her. Minutes creeped by at an agonizing pace as I waited and when she didn’t emerge after 20 minutes or so after the bell I felt in my gut that something was wrong. I bolted inside the school to search for her, asking anyone I passed by if they had seen her. Only to be met with indifferent shrugs until I came across Mrs. Galloway, the school counselor, who told me in a reassuring and almost grandmotherly manner that Haley had been feeling sick and that she went home early. \n\n“ Nothing to worry about at all buttercup” \n\nShe said to me with an ear to ear smile. There was something unsettling about how she said it. The words sounded rehearsed, like she had expected me to come here and ask about Haley’s whereabouts. I tried to dismiss the feeling as simple paranoia, because after all, my father was one thing, but Mrs. Galloway? She had no reason to lie to me. I was about to turn and leave when another question slipped out of me before I could stop myself. \n\n“ What did she say she was sick with?” \n\nMrs. Galloway blinked at the question, and said nothing for several moments. Her demeanor reminded me of a character in a Youtube video, frozen in time while the video was buffering before she finally answered. \n\n“ Oh she just had a bit too much sugar before bed, gave her nightmares, the poor dear. But she’s home now, safe and sound, don’t you worry buttercup.” \n\nI knew then that she was lying to me. Her words echoed my fathers and it chilled me to the bone. Also, at that moment I became acutely aware that we were both alone in the hallway outside her office with no one else in sight. The fluorescent lights above my head began to flicker as if they were losing power, bathing the area in darkness.    \n\n“ You look a little pale, buttercup. Why don’t you come into my office and lay down for a bit? I’ll get you some hot coco” \n\nShe said as she extended her arm outward to reach for me and I looked on in dumbfounded horror as her withered  arm seemed to stretch and grow as it reached for me. A strangled gasp escaped my lips and I fell backwards as black talons sprouted forth from beneath her finger tips  and brushed against my face before I fell and scrambled backward  on the tile floor. I scrambled back away from Mrs. Galloway as something totally unreal and near indescribable unfolded in front of me. Her veins seemed to turn black as her limbs grew longer and her skin began to churn. It seemed less like she was changing into something else and more like something utterly inhuman  was trying to burst out from beneath her skin, yet she didn’t seem to be in pain. \n\nShe kept a deranged smile on her face as thick black sludge began to pour from her lips  and her jaw seemed to unhinge like that of a snake’s. The overhead fluorescent lights flickered on and off in rapid succession, filling the empty hallway with a deep stygian darkness in between a few brief seconds of dim light, and I almost wished the they had just gone completely black because as the brief flashes of illuminated Mrs. Galloway’s contorted face and hideously deformed jaw, I could see what looked like a small humanoid head trying to push its way out of her throat. \n\nTwo glowing red eyes opened at the center of its tiny face and when they looked into mine, I let out a horrified scream and took off running down the hallway  in the opposite direction as fast as my legs could carry me despite my shock. As I ran I heard the thing that was once Mrs. Galloway call out to me in an amused and distorted voice. \n\n“ Oh don’t go yet, buttercup! stay and have some coco!” \n\nYou’ll often hear fans of horror movies talk about how stupid the protagonists are, how they seem to always make the worst possible decisions imaginable when the monsters show up and how they, if placed in the same situation, would be much smarter and handle much it better. I know this because I was once one of those people. But after having lived through this ordeal I can say with certainty  that that is an easy thing to say from the comfort of your couch, when the lights are on and you know the monsters aren’t real. The reality of it is much different. \n\nWhen your life's on the line and the dark is closing in, you’re not thinking, you’re just trying to get away, and as I ran down the dark hallway with Evil at my back, I past several doors and hallway intersections that in hindsight, would have provided me with an easy escape if I weren’t in a state of adrenaline fueled panic. I ran until I reached a locked set of double doors that obstructed my path and I nearly felt my heart stop. \n\nMy heart was pounding as I tried desperately to rip the doors open to no avail as I heard the creature that was once Mrs. Galloway call out to me. \n\n“There you are, buttercup ! Time to lay down!” \n\nAgainst my better judgment I turned and looked over my shoulder and nearly threw up as I saw that horrible monster approach. It was much larger now and approaching on all fours, its black talons scraping against the tile floor as it got closer. What was left of Mrs. Galloway hung from its hind legs like a sock it hadn’t bothered to fully remove. Its head had swollen to the size of a trash can and I could see rows of jagged teeth in its wide open maw. I was so terrified that I put my head down  curled into a ball  and tried to make myself as small as possible as I waited for the thing to inevitably pounce on me, when I  heard the thing let out an agonized scream as the smell of rotten eggs filled my nose. I looked up to see the shadow from my room standing between me and  the thing that was now wrapped in shadowy black tendrils that rose up from the floor and dug into its hide so tightly that blood oozed out from its constricted limbs. I tried to stand up but the shadow held out an ephemeral hand as if to tell me to hold still before it turned back to the bound abomination and used its long black tendrils to rip it apart with brutal efficiency. \n\nI  choked back vomit in my throat as I heard the thing that had been Mrs Galloway just a few moments earlier squeal in pain, loudly at first, then quietly and pitifully before its fragmented and broken body went rigid with the stillness of death, and the Shadow turned back to me, raising me back onto my feet with one of its many arms and dusting me off. \n\nReality was a very abstract concept to me in those long moments I spent  staring at the sentient darkness before me that had just saved me from certain death. I wanted to yell, and scream out in confusion, and demand a million different answers to a million burning questions that plagued my mind in that moment, but the only words that breached my lips were. \n\n“ Thank you.” \n\nThe Shadow simply nodded in acknowledgement before receding  backward down the hallway, dissipating into nothingness before I could even attempt to stop it. I don’t remember how long\n\nI stood there in that hallway alone with the dismembered  corpse of the monster or even how I got home. All that I do remember is the feeling of the cold rain that pelted my skin as I walked up my driveway and the knot of disgust I felt building in my stomach as I observed Officer Morgan’s unmarked police cruiser parked in it. \n\nMy father stood at the cruiser’s driver side door with an expression of cold anger on his face as he listened to Officer Morgan’s words through the rolled down window, and I only caught the tail end of their conversation before my father saw me coming up the driveway and cut him off. \n\n“ You’ve gone too far Bill, grief can only excuse so much. There is no happy ending to the path you’re on. The Circle won’t stand for this kind of exposure and your position will not protect you from the consequences…” \n\n“ Let me be perfectly clear Miles, you are never to come to my property,  speak to my son or his friends  ever again. If I find out that you have,and trust me, I will find out, there will be a reckoning for you.” \n\nHis words were firm and final. Morgan narrowed his eyes at my father for a moment before he nodded in acknowledgement. \n\n“ Have it your way” \n\nHe then rolled up his window and slowly backed out of the driveway casting a knowing glance at me before driving off into the rain. As I turned and  approached my father I saw his expression soften before he spoke. \n\n“ Hey kiddo.” \n\nAnger welled up in my chest and I practically screamed my reply at him \n\n“ Where’s Haley?! What did you do to her?!” \n\nSincere looking confusion spread across my father’s face at my outburst and it seeped into his voice. \n\n“ Haley? What are you talking about kiddo? Didn’t she go to school with you?” \n\nI felt hot tears begin to flow down my face even as the chilling rain washed them away as all the fear, pain and anger that had been building up in me over the past few months spilled out. \n\n“ Stop lying to me! I know you people took her!”  \n\nMy father stepped forward and placed his hands on my shoulders. \n\n“ What happened son? Tell me everything” \n\nBefore I could stop them the words spilled out of me like a torrent of water that burst from a dam and I told him about what had happened to me back at the school. About my search for Haley and about  Mrs. Galloway’s hideous transformation, and the expression on my father’s face as I told him these things was not one of surprise or disbelief, but rather one of cold anger. When I had cried so much that my words came out choked and hoarse my father relaxed his grip on my shoulders and beckoned me to follow him to his truck. \n\nI opened my mouth to demand an explanation but he cut me off before I could. \n\n“ Get in the truck son.” \n\n“ N..no” \n\nHis face turned angry at my refusal for a moment before melting into an expression of shame when he heard the fear in my voice. When he spoke again, he almost sounded like he was pleading with me. \n\n“ Get in the truck son, we’re going to save Haley, and once we do, I’ll tell you everything, I promise.” \n\nI couldn’t tell you exactly how long I stood there still as a statue in the freezing rain, afraid to concede to my father’s demands, but even more afraid of doing nothing. I knew that I didn’t trust him, but I also knew in my heart by then  that whatever evil was at work in Colter ran much deeper than my father. They were in my school, and probably in the sheriff’s office too. I didn’t know what else to do but agree to get in the passenger side of my Dad’s work truck and sit passively as he started the engine and drove us slowly down the driveway and down the darkened street as gargantuan storm clouds gathered overhead, smothering all sunlight from view…. \n\n“ Did he ever keep his promise?” asked Doctor Sweet, interrupting me once more, briefly breaking me out of my trance of reminisce.  \n\nWhether it was intentional or not, I couldn’t say, but the Doctor’s question reawakened a very old pain deep in my heart. Like picking open a wound that had scabbed over. \n\n“ No,” I said softly. \n\nThe doctor’s crimson eyes analyzed me passively as he took a long draw from his cigar, as if some intricate internal calculus kept him from replying immediately. Before long however, he spoke up again. \n\n“ Do you feel that if he had kept his promise, that if he had the opportunity to explain his motivations to you in detail, that would have somehow made his actions more palatable to you? Maybe even allow you to excuse them? “ \n\n“ The things my father did are inexcusable.” \n\n“ And what about the things you did Mr. Solomon?”  \n\n“What are you talking about?” \n\nThe Doctor then reached into the right hand side of his mahogany desk and produced a faded minella folder, which he placed neatly on the surface of the desk. \n\n“ I have here the autopsy report for one Haley Mathis. It’s quite a morbid read, in fact most would say it's tragic.” \n\n“Where did you get that?” \n\n“ How I got it is of no consequence to your treatment Mr. Solomon, what matters is its contents.” \n\nHe then opened the folder and began to read its contents aloud, showing all  the emotion with which one might have read a dinner menu or a weather report. \n\n“ The examiner noted acute petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes, a sure sign of strangulation, and also recorded several severe lacerations about the neck and abdomen with an unknown weapon…:” \n\n“ Stop it!” \n\nI screamed. Not wanting to hear him talk about Haley like some inanimate object\n\n“ Therapy sometimes requires you to go to painful places if you are to make a breakthrough, Mr. Sharp.” \n\n“ Why are you doing this?” \n\n“ I’m doing this because you need to face what you have done if the treatment is to be effective. You need to be honest with yourself.” \n\n“ I’ve told you everything that I  remember!” \n\n“ No, you’ve merely detailed the elaborate delusion your mind has crafted to excuse you from guilt.” \n\n“What are you talking about?”  \n\n“ You describe your victims as having turned into horrid inhuman abominations so that you can rationalize what you did to them as self defense, but it wasn’t self defense was it Mr. Solomon? As for this mystical Shadow you describe, it’s likely a kind of altar ego you’ve created to further disassociate yourself from your crimes.” \n\n“No! No you’re wrong” \n\n“ That is the logical conclusion  that the evidence leads us to Mr. Solomon, it also suggests very strongly that you aided and abetted your father in the massacre at Sully’s Bar.” \n\n“ You weren’t there,” \n\n“ Then give me the missing piece of the puzzle! Tell me about Shiloh, so we can finally put all of this to rest.” \n\n“ You’ll get what you’re asking for soon enough, Doctor, but you’re going to regret it.” I responded with grave certainty.",

Or rather, one of the security guards did. He called me right away, talking in that sort of low, empty tone. He sounded dead inside, for lack of a better word.\n\n\"Miss Novak.'' He fell silent for a few seconds, like he hadn't really thought of what to say next. \"Uh, you should come to the red meadow, I think.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, *you think?*\" I asked, a little annoyed seeing as I'd been busy with some computer work at that moment. I instantly regretted my brusque tone.\n\n\"There's a body.\" \n\nI nearly dropped my cell phone. Suddenly feeling weirdly disconnected from myself, I staggered to my feet and began fumbling for my keys. \"I'll be right there, Gus,\" I promised, voice trembling, before ending the call.\n\nThe red meadow is a wide plain right outside the eastern edge of the woods. It's full of these strange scarlet flowers. They're about the same size as a regular old daisy, and their petals are shaped a bit like tiny hearts. Weirdly enough, we've been unable to identify them. There are many flowers *like* them, but none are an exact match. My father used to be obsessed with them—he was always picking and drying them. He never found out more about them either, though.\n\nToday, a blanket of snow covered the meadow, yet the intense red of the flowers still managed to shine through in some places. I could see Fergus standing near the treeline, stiffly waving to me. His shallow, labored breaths rose from his lips in tiny plumes of vapor as he jogged to meet me halfway.\n\n\"I didn't see it happen,\" he said dryly. \"I heard screams, I followed them, and there he was. Whatever did it was already gone by the time I got there.\"\n\nHe led me over to the body. A man in his thirties, dressed in much the same functional clothes as the first cryptid hunter who'd found his way onto my property not too long ago. My head was reeling. How did these guys keep getting in?\n\n\"I think he died of fright,\" Gus remarked. \"When I found him, he was lying on his stomach, with one of his arms underneath him.\"\n\n\"Why'd you roll him over?\"\n\n\"Checking for injuries. Found nothing. Not even a trace of blood. Look at his face though.\"\n\nI sighed. I'd admittedly avoided doing so up to that point. I knelt down next to the dead man, gathering my large, far too voluminous skirt at my sides. I raised my eyes to meet the corpse's empty gaze. Shaking my head, I tried to chase the flashing memories of my little brother's severed head from my mind. All those who die in fear seem to share this same look. Their horror remains imprinted on their contorted grimace, preserved for those unfortunate enough to happen upon their bodies.\n\nFergus was probably right. The way he'd found this man suggested he'd been on his way out of the woods, presumably running from something. Another thrill-seeker who'd had too much of a good thing. It was even sadder to see him *here*, beyond the treeline. He'd nearly made it out alive. Then the adrenaline must have overtaxed his heart, and he'd fallen over, clutching his chest. I wondered if he'd realized what was happening. Maybe not. Maybe he'd been so terrified by whatever was chasing him that he hadn't even seen it coming. Either way, in his last moments, there had only been him, this fearsome unknown entity and his exerted, failing body. What a shitty way to go.\n\n\"Are you okay, Gus? Do you wanna go home?\"\n\n\"You need me here, don't you?\"\n\n\"I do, but I don't want you to go around like nothing happened when you've just found a body,\" I argued.\n\n\"I'll be okay. It's not the first time we've had a death here.\"\n\nI gave him a concerned frown. He didn't sound all that convincing. He obviously didn't want me to fuss, so I didn't, but it felt crappy leaving him on that note. I told him to follow his normal route, hoping the rest of the day would go smoothly for him. To me, however, this corpse meant a lot more work. First off, I would have to dispose of him. It's not like we go entirely unnoticed out here—we could get a visit from the police in due time. Now, my family has maybe two or three friends among the local authorities who know what's really going on in these woods. They're likely to see to it that, if someone goes missing on our property, no further inquiries are made. Imagine a search being launched in my forest—it'd be a bloodbath.\n\nEven so, best not to risk anything. The corpse still needed to disappear. The easiest way to do that was to dump it in the lake. In case I haven't mentioned it before, the lake is located about a twenty minute walk from the red meadow in a lighter, less densely wooded area. It's twin lakes, actually, connected by a fierce old stream. I had the bigger one in mind, though. Drop something in there and it'll be gone in a flash. Fall in yourself and… oh well. It hasn't frozen over yet this year, so I decided to go for it right away.\n\nI don't have a vehicle fit to transport a corpse through the woods, but I do have Jeanette. \n\nJeanette is a mule. \n\nI got one of my workers who was hanging out at my family's house at the moment to bring her right over. We loaded her up and I got on my way. The woods were quiet, as per usual. Walking alone normally agrees with me, but hauling a corpse and a stubborn mule really put a damper on the mood. I tried to focus on the glittering snow beneath my boots and the many shiny icicles that made the forest resemble a stalactite cave—anything but the dead body bobbing up and down on the back of the animal beside me. We were getting on slower than I'd hoped. The wintry air was beginning to sting my bare shoulders. Seeing as I normally didn't mind it at all, that was saying something. \n\nJeanette was being a drama queen. She always knows when I really need her help, and it's then that she's the most uncooperative. With the sun going down in the afternoon this time of year, darkness was already beginning to settle over the treetops. The water surface was still and undisturbed, covered partially by thin plates of ice. I surveyed the lake with bated breath. As peaceful as it looked, I knew how volatile a state this tranquility posed come nightfall. \n\n\"Grandfather!\" I called out into the darkness, trying to keep my voice down. Now, the creature I was hoping to rouse obviously isn't my actual grandfather; it's just a nickname he, the *vodyanoy*, goes by. I needed to talk to him to ask permission before laying the ill-fated explorer to rest in his waters. The lake stayed eerily quiet. \"Grandfather!\" I repeated, a little louder this time. I hated having to raise my voice. The woods prefer silence.\n\nTo my frustration, I received no response. The water remained an unblinking black mirror without so much as a single bubble rising to the surface. It didn't look as though Grandfather Vodyanoy was going to show up, which meant that I was being faced with a difficult decision. I really didn't want to stick around for anything that might have overheard me shouting to drop in. I would have to dump the cadaver without consulting the big boss. Against my better judgment, I dragged the body off my mule and rolled it towards the edge of the lake. Giving it one last powerful shove, it fell off the small ridge and disappeared with a satisfying *plop*. I imagined it rapidly sinking to the bottom, and a weight fell off my shoulders. I lingered for merely a minute, wallowing in my melancholy and wondering if the vodyanoy would be mad at me when he woke up to find I'd used his haunting grounds as garbage disposal.\n\nThat question would not go unanswered for long.\n\nJust as I turned to leave, I heard a frantic, *enormous* splashing sound. Whirling around, I let out a yelp of surprise when I saw the creature rise from the murky depths. He was twice my size; an old, green-skinned man with a nightmarishly contorted face that resembled that of a catfish more than a human's. I staggered backwards as he started dragging himself up onto the dry land on his big paunch, his morbid, fleshy masses wrinkling and wriggling grotesquely. Algae hung in his long, tangled white hair and scales covered the lower part of his body which thinned into a fish tail.\n\nI cursed myself for not waiting for him earlier. Perhaps he'd heard me, lingering just beneath the surface, expecting me to make a transgression he could justly punish me for. I could feel I was about to pay dearly for my impatience.\n\n\"Grandfather, I'm sorry!\" I instantly cried out. \"I was nervous; I had to be quick so I—\"\n\nHe didn't answer, only letting out a gurgling laugh as he wrapped one of his webbed paws around my ankle, throwing me off balance. I landed on my ass in the dirt, blindly thrashing and kicking at his face, but before I knew it, he'd tugged me into a forceful embrace. Pressed up against his slick, saggy chest, I gagged at the foul odor he emitted. The slimy muck coating his skin rubbed off onto my face, arms and dress, instilling such a deep sense of disgust within me that I couldn't help but heave. Now soiled with my own vomit, I was pulled into the icy water. I was too shocked—physically as well as mentally—to fathom a single clear thought; all I could do was screech like a banshee. The vodyanoy let go of me, giving me a meaningful look before shoving me further out onto the lake. My dress bore me up, and I was sent gliding through the water.\n\n\"I do so despise impertinence,\" he called out to me, his voice equal parts rage-filled and amused. It was raspy, wet and blubbering, as though he was retching out water from his lungs with every word he said. \"See you at the bottom.\" With that, he sank down, not causing a single splash.\n\nFuck. \n\nMom had warned me never to stand too close to the water's edge. What the hell had I been thinking? \n\nI started swimming towards the ridge again, only to realize in horror just how difficult it was. My voluminous skirt was already soaked, its weight seemingly doubling mine. There was white all around me. My puffed sleeves had tightened, gripping my upper arms like chains. I was fighting against my own wedding dress and it quickly gained the upper hand. I was barely able to stay afloat, much less reach firm ground again; my head kept bobbing under—I couldn't keep it above the surface for long. Gasping for air, my rapid movements brought me closer and closer to exhaustion. Just as I was sinking down once more, I caught a glimpse of a menacingly tall silhouette looming over the lakeside. \n\n*\"Quick, take my hand if you want to live!\"*\n\nThe Leshy's voice cut through the water. I could hear it clearly even when submerged. Summoning my last bit of strength, I flung myself out of the water and reached for the monstrous, log-like arm he extended to me across the surface. It was long enough for me to climb it like an entire tree, but I was still too heavy—the dress dragged me under. I couldn't pull myself up. Sputtering and gasping for air, I dug my fingers into the Leshy's bark skin.\n\n*\"Shed your gown!\"* the wood-demon commanded, urgency swinging along in his tone. *\"Wench, it'll drown you!\"*\n\n\"I can't!\" I cried out. \"Pull! Just pull, I'll hang on!\"\n\nHe let out a growl, then abruptly drew back his arm, taking me along. Plowing through the freezing water, I felt a relief unlike anything I'd ever known. Once I was close enough, he grabbed me with both hands and lifted me out of the water, dropping me beside my mule. Jeanette had been standing beneath one of the old lakeside trees, resting up and not really minding my near death experience. Coughing up dirty cold water, I huffed and panted, trying to catch my breath while furiously rubbing my own upper arms to try and regain some semblance of feeling in my frozen skin. I didn't see the Leshy change form, being more occupied with myself at that moment; but when I looked up again, I found the bearded man with the cudgel standing over me.\n\n\"Why didn't you get out of your dress?\" he asked testily. \n\n\"I couldn't. It's hell to get into in the first place; you really think I can just pull down a zipper and it comes off?\"\n\nHe looked almost annoyed. It was odd seeing him display such a human emotion. He caught himself though, straightening up and clearing his throat. \"I hope you're aware you just caused me some trouble, potentially. The vodyanoy is the lord of this lake. He's unlikely to appreciate my intrusion.\"\n\n\"What are you getting at?\"\n\nHe didn't respond right away. Instead, he gave me a long look, appraising me. \"I'll tell you what, heiress. I'll see you home safely, so that you don't freeze to death… or get taken advantage of. All alone out here as you are. I will have saved you, and you are going to repay me.\"\n\nThe air felt even colder all of a sudden. I yearned for a dry, warm blanket to wrap around my shoulders, but my garments were drenched and more likely to freeze me into a statue. As much as it pained me to admit it, I needed his help. Dearly.\n\n\"I'll pay you back accordingly,\" I promised, pressing the words out between chattering teeth. \"But I'd be willing to bet you already have something in mind.\"\n\n\"Right,\" he said. \"Of course I do. And you *will* follow.\"\n\nI sighed. \"Yes, Sir. I will.\"\n\nX](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

Well, readers, we had to go as well to somehow stop her.\n\nAh, fun times.\n\nNext to me, meanwhile, Raj and Diana had been napping for the better part of a few hours, eyes covered with an eye mask. Which left the only person still awake…\n\n“Hey Sam”, I whispered. “Can’t sleep?”\n\nNodding, he replied, “Yeah. I… just have a lot going on in my head right now.”\n\nTruth be told, he did seem to be somewhat troubled. I figured that then would be the best time to figure out what was troubling him.\n\n“Oh, that’s terrible. What is troubling you at this point?”\n\n“It’s just… I don’t really do well in conflict situations nowadays. I hate how it sounds and feels, and brings back… a lot of traumatic experiences.” \n\n“Why do you feel so?”, I asked, deciding to probe further.\n\n“I haven’t told any of you about this, but I used to serve in the army. I was deployed in Iraq, in fact, from 2003 to 2009. The things I’ve had to do… the things I’ve seen… I never wanted to experience any of that again. But yet, here I am…”, he trailed off.\n\n“It’s fine, you don’t have to talk about this if you don’t want to”, I reassured him. In reality, I had no idea how to respond, as this revelation about his life most certainly was a bombshell.\n\n“No, it’s fine. I trust you. I’ve seen a great many things. I’ve seen my fellow soldiers, who I considered my brothers, get blown to bits in front of me. I’ve seen innocent civilians get massacred, just for existing and being in the wrong place. No matter how much I try to forget, adjust to normal society, bury myself in my work… I can never leave my past. Sometimes… I wonder. Why am I alive and they dead? I could have tried to save them…”\n\n“That’s terrible. But remember, it’s not your fault. After that, have you ever tried therapy? To help you deal with your problems?”\n\n“Nope, I didn’t think it would help me much back then. You’re a psychologist, right?”\n\n“Nope. Close enough, but I’m a neurologist. I could help you out a little bit, though we don’t have much time.”, I responded.\n\n“Thanks. The thing is…”, he paused. “I’m tired of losing. Losing people close to me, losing years of my life. I really don’t want to do this again.”\n\n“Sam, don’t lose hope. This is our duty. We must do this, for the good of the world. The responsibility is ours alone. What would happen if Aurora was left unstopped? We should not lose!”, I responded, trying to motivate him.\n\n“When you put it that way… you’re not wrong. What else can we do?”, he said, before barking out a laugh.\n\nAfter that, the ride mostly passed in silence without any further discussion. He did not seem to want to pour out more problems, despite my prompting. Eventually, the plane skidded to a halt on the tarmac of Istanbul Airport. Diana and Sam, too, awoke from their slumber. Luckily, since the flight was a red-eye flight, we managed to arrive when it was broad daylight. That time, just like the last city, we opted to quickly dump our bags in a nearby hotel. After which, we began searching for Aurora with the trusty tracker again.\n\n“It’s freezing out here!”, I commented as I slipped on my jacket. I didn’t expect Istanbul to be that cold, even if it was December.\n\n“So, where is Aurora again?” Sam asked.\n\nPeering at our tracker, Diana said, “She’s been running around the city throughout the night, but now she’s stopping at a neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city.”\n\n“That can’t be good,'' Raj commented. “Margaret?”\n\n“Yes?”, I asked, perking up.\n\n“Go to this address here, we’ll start there.”\n\nAs we sped past the greenery between the airport and Istanbul in the company car, we discussed our strategy to finish Aurora.\n\n“So, once we get near her, we’ll get on foot in pairs or as a group. We’ll search for her, and fire at will as soon as we see her and have a clear shot. So keep your eyes peeled, got it?”\n\n“So, will we be ending her, then?”, I asked.\n\nDiana didn’t respond.\n\n“Diana?”, I prompted. “Will we be ending her?”\n\n“...Yes. We will be using the real bullets this time.”, she replied hesitantly.\n\nEventually, we drove into an urban neighbourhood and navigated the side roads, going deeper and deeper into the city. Finally, we noticed that we were a few streets away from Aurora’s purported location.\n\n“Stop here!” Diana exclaimed. “This is around where she is.”\n\nImmediately, I parked the car at the side of the road and we disembarked the vehicle.\n\nAs she seemed to be standing on the same road for the past hour or so, we decided to simply head there and find her. However, as we rounded a corner, we heard a few people conversing nearby. Immediately, Raj held a palm up, and we stopped and listened.\n\n“If you need anything, just come back here, alright?”, a woman said.\n\n“Alright, I will! Thanks for your help!” Aurora's high-pitched voice rang out. \n\n“No problem, dear!”\n\n“That has to be her”, Raj grumbled. \n\n“We should go now, then!”, I whispered.\n\n“Alright. Let’s go! Now!”\n\nWe didn’t have to be asked twice. Immediately, we rushed into the narrow alley and upon seeing Aurora, emptied our entire clip at her as she turned to us in shock.\n\nAnd for once, although not all the bullets hit her, we struck true. From the entrance of their house, two people, a man and a woman stood transfixed as light grey liquid began seeping from her midriff and shoulder.\n\n“So, you’ve seen too much.”, she softly stated as she approached them. The woman began to shy away from the approaching Aurora.\n\n“Die then!”, she snarled. She took a piece of wood that lay on the side of the road and slammed it hard on the woman’s head with a thud. The woman immediately fell to the ground like a sack of bricks and lay there, dead.\n\n“How could you do this!”, the man screamed at Aurora. “We fed you! We hel-”\n\nHe, too, met the same fate as the woman, getting decked hard in the back of the head. He, too, did not survive.\n\n“Ah, red. It’s always been my favourite colour!”, Aurora commented as they bled out on the tarmac.\n\n“What the hell Aurora!” Raj yelled.\n\nShe took a few steps towards us, and looked up and down at her injured, bleeding body (yes, the liquid is like blood for her body). “And you people! You’ll pay for this!”, she snarled angrily at us. “They deserved it anyways, they let me in!”\n\n“Whatever. Reload and fire, now!” I ordered everyone. Truth be told, after my last encounter with her, I really disliked listening to her monologues.\n\nJust then, a boy came out of the house. He was quite young, possibly not older than eight.\n\n“Anne, baba?”, he whispered, shaking the bodies of his parents who were just murdered by Aurora.\n\n“Don’t shoot! Stop her!” Raj yelled as Aurora raised her heel.\n\nBut it was too late. She stomped on the boy’s neck with a sickening crack, causing it to be twisted in an odd angle. He fell to the ground as life drained out of his eyes.\n\nAs we raised our guns up, ready to fire again, Aurora turned back to us. \n\n“You’re done for!”, she threatened. She reached for a nearby bag, and threw some sort of kitchen utensil at us. A pressure cooker, maybe? In the second it flew towards us, Sam stared at it in shock.\n\n“It… it’s a…”, he muttered, but I never heard what he said afterwards, for it exploded with a blinding fiery cloud! The shockwave threw me back straight to the other side of the alley, and shrapnel stung my face and body. While my head was spinning from the shock of the explosion, I was still semi-conscious. A minute later, when I found the energy to get up, all I could see was thick black smoke, the wrecked remains of cars and fragments from the surrounding buildings. \n\n“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! What the hell!”, I screamed in shock, before peering through the smouldering, smoky, debris-filled alley. I tried pulling out my gun, only to realise it wasn’t in my pocket! It must have been strewn somewhere in the explosion.\n\nAs I caught a glimpse of Aurora’s blond hair, I staggered to her location, avoiding the sharp bits lining the road. The place was full of nails, probably from the bomb.\n\nThere, I found Sam, who seemed to be fully lucid and physically unharmed like me. Better yet, he had his gun and a clear shot at Aurora, who was simply leaning against one of the blown out buildings.\n\n“Sam. I don’t have my gun. Shoot!”, I commanded. He, however, lay there trembling and staring off at the distance.\n\n“Sam. Now’s our only chance!”, I urged. Then, I realised that although he was physically unharmed, mentally…\n\n“Not for long!”, Aurora snickered, before unexpectedly dragging Sam away by his legs. \n\n“Sam!” I yelled in surprise as I began pursuing him.\n\n“He’ll be the first!”, she cackled as she jumped into the boot of a white van, roughly shoving an unaware Sam in.\n\n“First? First of what?” I yelled out in frustration as I ran behind the van. As the van sped up, I knew I couldn’t continue to run. Rounding the corner past a convenience store whose doors had been blown off, I ran to the car, only to realise that its tires had been slashed and windscreen smashed in. \n\nThat, too, must have been Aurora’s handiwork.\n\nAt that point, I had no other option. The van, too, was going further and urther away from me. And that was when I saw the motorbike leaning against a building.\n\nNow, I would never normally do something like that, but I was desperate. \n\nI grabbed the motorbike, which for some reason had the keys still in the ignition, and gunned the acceleration. The motorbike roared as I manoeuvered it through the narrow roads and alleys, eventually merging into the main road. I weaved in and out of the Istanbul traffic at high speeds, keeping my eye solely on the speeding white van. Getting Sam back was all that mattered at the moment.\n\nI probably looked like a madwoman then, so it was for the best that I wasn’t pulled over by the traffic police. I didn’t even have a helmet on me!\n\nI continued tirelessly chasing the van for hours, driving across the Bosphorus, turning in and out of crowded streets, all to foil Aurora’s plan. Suddenly, the van began driving erratically, before slowing a little.\n\nAnd why was that?\n\nAs the side door opened, a man with a beard was pushed out. As he fell hard on the tarmac, Aurora pulled out a pistol and shot him thrice in the head and heart, and once in the balls, before closing the door and driving on.\n\nOh, so that was why.\n\nEventually, I followed her through expansive green spaces and outside the city until the motorbike began sputtering for several seconds, before finally giving out. The van, meanwhile, continued on until disappearing from my sight.\n\n“God fucking damn it!”, I swore, before dragging it to the nearest gas station. \n\nTwenty minutes later, at the gas station, I called Diana to know what happened to them after I bailed on them. However, after multiple attempts I still could not reach her phone. Next, I called Raj, who picked up after the second attempt.\n\n“Hey Raj. Where are you guys at now?”, I enquired.\n\n“We’re at the hospital right now.”\n\n“The hospital? Why?”\n\n“Oh, Diana got injured very badly, she took the brunt of the explosion. From what I saw, she got smashed headfirst into a brick wall. Oh, and she got injured badly by some of the flying nails. You should come here now!”\n\n“Alright, I’ll come!”\n\nInstead of refilling the motorbike, I opted to surreptitiously leave it somewhere before trying to hail a taxi rather than rough it out myself. Two hours of wrestling through traffic later, I arrived at the location Raj told me to come to.\n\nI walked through the hospital doors and asked for Diana’s details, before heading straight for her ward. As soon as I saw her, I walked straight up to her bed.\n\n“Are you okay?”\n\n“Yeah, I’m pretty banged up, but I’ll probably get better soon. You’re fine, right?”\n\nIt was then, that I realised I was covered in cuts and scars. Well, after all, adrenaline is a hell of a drug.\n\n“I’m not injured too badly, I’m fine.”\n\nThen, Raj walked in.\n\n“I’m back.”. Lowering his voice to a whisper, he asked, “So what about Aurora and Sam?”\n\nI shook my head. “Nope. I couldn’t get a hold on them. I’m so sorry.”. I then explained the chase I underwent and Aurora’s eventual escape from me.\n\n“It’s okay,”, Raj reassured, “We’ll find them soon.”\n\nAs I moved to the tracker and checked it, I came to a horrifying revelation.\n\n“Raj”, I whispered, “It doesn’t work.”.\n\n“What isn’t working?”\n\n“The tracker. It says there’s an error and that it can’t locate her.”\n\n“It must have been destroyed in the explosion, then”, Diana croaked. “The tracker was implanted in her.”\n\nAnd that was when the gravity of our situation fully sank in. Without the tracker, we would not  be able to know where she was going, or even guess what she was doing. Barring any outside help, we were essentially running blind, our chase screeching to a halt.\n\nI then suggested that we call the police, against our previous directive. “They might be able to help us locate her!”, I explained.\n\n“That’s what I thought at first. Telling the police would be the right thing to do.”, Raj explained. However, we have our instructions. And besides, it is quite likely they might blame us for everything. Our marks are all over the place!”\n\nInstead, we melancholically stayed in Istanbul for the next few days. Together, we tried a variety of ways to track them, like tracing Sam’s phone. Of course, none of it worked.\n\nOn day 3, when we were in the hotel room, Diana’s phone rang.\n\n“Diana’s away for a few minutes. You answer them.”, Raj instructed me.\n\nAs he suggested, I picked up the phone and answered it. “Hello?”\n\n“Hi, this is the agent from the corporation.”\n\nOh, so that was the agent Diana talked to.\n\n“Alright, what is it?”\n\n“From our intel, we’ve found where Aurora is going.”\n\n“Where?”, I asked. Finally, we had somewhere to find her at!\n\n“Leh.”\n\n“Leh?”\n\n“Leh, in Jammu and Kashmir. She entered in through Pakistan, if our information is correct.”\n\n“Alright.”, I said. In reality, I would probably have to search that up on, like, Google Maps or something.\n\n“We will be providing you with resources such as advanced weaponry like machine guns, UAVs and grenades, but you can only redeem these at Leh itself due to air travel constraints. Oh, and we’ve arranged for the entry permits to enter the state. Alright?”\n\n“Alright then,”, I replied, “We’ll go there as soon as possible, then. Oh, and is Sam with her?”\n\n“Yes”, the person confirmed, “Sam appears to be alive and with her.”\n\nEnding the call, I turned to my colleagues. “We have orders guys!”, I called out. “Sam is alive! We’re going to Leh!”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites/)",

        "text": "Her loss was a physical thing. It held my heart in a vice, gripping it like the claws of some hideous beast, piercing me until my grief trickled out from the wounds like blood. Mourning was a poor word to describe such a feeling. It was a feeling more than sorrow - an emptiness, a void somehow absent of anything yet filled with pain. The kind of pressure that leaves you begging to be taken away, once and for all, to a place where things like human emotions cease to exist and numbness truly takes control. If only such places were true.\n\nAnd that wasn't even the worst of it all. The real truth, the guilt beyond the grief, was pain beyond comparison. \n\nI stayed in bed for weeks. My parents brought food to my bed, but even the sweets I'd loved since childhood seemed to turn sickening on my tongue. Sips of water felt as salty as the tears I had become well accustomed to. Day by day, my blankets seemed to harden around me like a chrysalis. My grief was melting me down into something new, yet I had no desire to be reborn.\n\nFor what I had done, I deserved only the worst.\n\nIt was on the fourteenth day following my loss that I met the Grief.\n\nThe house was empty. The soup on my bedside table had turned cold. The book sitting upon my lap lay unread. I stared at the stars etched upon the ceiling of my childhood room. *She'd* painted them there for me years ago. After each one had been completed, I'd made a wish. As I looked from star to star, I silently wished for the same thing, wondering if some vestiges of childhood magic could bring the impossible. \n\n\"Wishing is useless, you know.\"\n\nAt first, I thought I was hearing my own thoughts. It was the croaking laugh that startled me out of my melancholy. Rolling over in my bed, I came face to face with the most bizarre creature I had ever seen.\n\nIt looked like a frog, but covered in a thin layer of grey fur. Huge black eyes glittered as though they contained stars, and as it opened its mouth to laugh, I saw thin greyish tongue flicker between toothless gums. Most significantly, it was skeletal. Its fur did nothing to conceal the fragile bones of its delicate frame.\n\nI tried to scream. Days of near-total silence had stolen my voice.\n\n\"Don't be afraid.\" The creature sat beside the abandoned bowl of soup. \"I'm not here to hurt you. I'm just your Grief.\"\n\n\"My Grief?\" My voice was almost as croaky as the creature's.\n\n\"Indeed. Everyone has one, after they suffer a loss. I'm a special kind of companion, you see. I help you recover while you grieve. It's my job to get you back on your feet and back into the world of the living.\"\n\nHope had flared through me for a second - and then disappointment. The creature wasn't here to hurt me. This ridiculous frog-like creature thought it could help me. Pointless. I knew I was beyond help. I didn't deserve help.\n\n\"No, thank you.\" I rolled back over in my bed.\n\nThe frog clicked its tongue. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"You don't know about my grief.\"\n\n\"But I do. I know about your grief - and your guilt.\"\n\nI shivered. Images flashed through my mind. Long white corridors. Incessant beeping. People rushing in white coats. A silence that stretched on, and on, and on.\n\n\"Then you know I don't deserve to be helped.\"\n\n\"Everyone deserves help. Even you.\" I rolled my eyes, but a lump had risen in my throat. \"Let's start with something easy. Tell me something small about your loss.\"\n\nI wanted to ignore the Grief. I wanted to push it away, throw it into the bowl of soup, or just ignore it until my mind re-entered the state of numbness where only guilt and grief could find me.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nI turned to face the Grief again. Stars sparkled in its eyes like wishes.\n\n\"My nan...\" I began before the lump in my throat threatened to overwhelm me. It was a few moments before I could collect myself. \"My nan loved the colour red. Even in her sixties, she had her nails manicured and painted bright red every month. The exact shade of her purse and boots. She even dyed her hair red, to hide the grey. She said red was the colour of life, and she never intended to stop living it.\"\n\nThe Grief smiled. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For feeding me.\" The Grief belched. \"Your grief sustains me as much as it burdens you. Every memory you share with me frees the burden of your grief a little more, but it feeds me as much as a meal feeds you. Grief demands to be fed. If you keep telling me stories, your loss will weaken, but I will grow stronger. It's the only way we can both survive.\"\n\nIt was a remarkable deal. \"So if I tell you stories about my...loss, I'll feel better?\"\n\n\"You'll be able to live your life again, just like your nan would have wanted.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. It felt like the first I had taken in a long time. \"Then I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"Good.\" The Grief smiled. \"I'll see you again tomorrow.\"\n\nI never saw how it disappeared. I was just beginning to feel aware of a distant lightness in my chest. So weak, like the faintest breath, but it was there.\n\nI sat up in bed. The stars above my head seemed to twinkle.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEvery day, the Grief came back. And every day, I told the Grief a new story.\n\n\"My nan was the youngest of three sisters. Her parents named her Sam, just Sam, not short for Samantha. At the beginning of the school year, teachers would always see her name and assume she was a boy. She ended up on lists for the boy's football teams instead of the girl's hockey, stuff like that. But she'd never say a word until she showed up, just to see the looks on their faces.\"\n\n\"One time, when my mother was pregnant with me, my grandparents decided to try weed for the first time. They bought edibles and tried a piece, but nothing happened, so they took another. And another. And another. An hour later, they had called both my mum and an ambulance, convinced they were having heart attacks. The paramedics joked that their bungalow smelled like a student's dorm. My nan used it as a cautionary tale right before I went to university, but she couldn't tell the story without laughing.\"\n\n\"Every year after school ended, my nan would take me shopping for clothes to wear over the summer. My mum wanted her to pick out modest, feminine clothes - floral print dresses, long skirts, blouses and all that. But when I was fourteen, I had a goth phase. Nan thought it was brilliant. The look on my mum's face when I came home with armfuls of black leather and a pair of Docs is something I'll never forget.\"\n\nWith each telling, the Grief grew fatter and fatter. Soon, it was the size of a cat, then a small dog. Meanwhile, the burden on my own heart was growing less. I grew to find a cooked meal manageable again. Sometimes I got out of bed to stretch my legs. I brushed my hair for the first time in weeks. My parents were shocked at the sudden change, but didn't question it, thinking I was coming to terms with the loss of my nan at last.\n\nBut at the back of my mind, the guilt remained as strong as ever.\n\nOne day, my dad came to sit with me in my room. \"How are you doing, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"Okay, I think.\" I almost managed a smile. \"Better than before, anyway.\"\n\n\"That's great! I found something that might make you feel even better.\" He handed it to me. It was a small bottle of red nail polish. Something churned in my stomach as I looked at it. \n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"It belonged to your grandmother. You know how much she loved this colour. Maybe you can wear it and think of her?\"\n\nI couldn't respond. The colour seemed to flash behind my eyes as a deep feeling of dread opened up in my stomach. \n\nSince when had my nan liked the colour red?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI kept telling stories every day. But the feeling of dread didn't go away. \n\nThe Grief never asked questions - he only grew and grew. But I began to falter in my stories. First, I forgot my nan's favourite drink. The one she always had every time we visited her bungalow. Then, it was the place we'd visited on holiday every year since I was a little girl. I could remember the taste of the ocean air and the smell of fish and chips by the sea, but nothing else. I knew things were bad when I showed the Grief old photos of her marriage and couldn't recall her maiden name.\n\n\"What's wrong with me?\" I despaired. The Grief was now as tall as my shoulders. \"Why am I forgetting so many things?\"\n\nThe Grief only smiled. \"Tell me more about your nan. I'm feeling especially hungry today.\"\n\nI sank down into my bed with a sigh. \"I don't feel like it.\"\n\n\"You'll regret it if you don't.\"\n\nI raised my head. The Grief stood over me, expectant. It bared its teeth in a ferocious grin. How long had it had teeth?\n\n\"W-What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Tell me stories. I'm hungry. Tell me stories. I need something to eat.\"\n\nShivering, I pulled back from the Grief, but it only leaned closer. \n\n\"What's wrong? Don't you have any stories left?\" The stars in its eyes seemed to have a menacing glow.\n\n\"Of course I do! It's just that- that...\"\n\nI tried to picture my nan. She had red hair - or was it brown like mine? I tried to recall the things I loved most about her. Her smile. The tittering cadence of her laugh. The way she danced with my grandfather after too many glasses of wine. How she held me after I broke up with my first high school romance. Even the colour of her eyes.\n\nNothing. It was all gone.\n\n\"How did you do this to me?\" I gasped. The Grief towered over me like a horror from a nightmare. Its black eyes seemed to draw me in. My fear kept me in place. I couldn't move, even if I tried.\n\n\"You have fed me, and I have taken your grief, just as I promised. The deal is done. But I am still hungry.\"\n\n\"You can't do this!\" Tears threatened to spill down my cheeks. \"Why can't I remember my nan?\"\n\n\"Without your nan, there is no one to grieve. Doesn't your chest feel lighter. Isn't your head clearer. Aren't you able to get out of bed, please your parents, enter the outside world again?\"\n\nIt was true. I was finally beginning to act like a human being again. The wounds in my heart were empty punctures. The grief that had trickled out had finally bled to a stop.\n\nBut.\n\n\"I want my nan back,\" I choked. \"I want my memories back. Please. Give them back to me.\"\n\n\"Even if it means mourning her again?\"\n\n\"Anything.\"\n\nThe Grief cocked its head. \"Fine. But we have to make another deal.\"\n\n\"Like I said. Anything.\"\n\n\"This time I don't want your grief.\" The creature paused. \"I want your guilt.\"\n\nWaves of terror washed over me. I could feel the dread seeping into my limbs, pinning me to the bed like iron as the guilt its words awakened began to fill my lungs and choke them until I could hardly breathe--\n\n\"No,\" I gasped, my vision beginning to blacken. \"You can't do this.\"\n\n\"You must give me your guilt.\" The Grief spread its arms wide. An unseen breeze rippled through its short fur. \"It is the only way I can give you your memories, and the only thing I have left to consume.\"\n\nIt felt like the world around me was falling away. My bed, the walls of my room, the floor, everything except those stars twinkling on the ceiling had faded away into blackness. The Grief and I were the only things left in the world. \n\n\"Please,\" I begged. The Grief did nothing.\n\nThe stars above me began to glow. They glowed brighter and brighter until the blackness around us faded into white. An impossibly clinical white, the kind that brought dread to my stomach. From somewhere unseen, a beeping began.\n\n\"This is your guilt,\" the Grief said. Faint objects were beginning to materialise around us. I recognised the framework of a room and a bed. \"Are you willing to tell the story?\"\n\nThe scene around us grew brighter and brighter. The sound grew stronger and stronger. I saw three figures standing beside the bed, but it wasn't until I saw who lay there that I began to sob.\n\nMy nan's red hair was the only speck of colour in the room.\n\n\"I was so afraid,\" I gasped between sobs. \"Nan had been sick for weeks. It was so sudden. One day, she was fine, and the next day she couldn't breathe. The hospital put her in an induced coma, things were so bad. And for a few days things stayed like that. But one night, everything went wrong.\"\n\nThe figures around the bed were crying. The smallest, a girl with short brown hair, could barely stand.\n\n\"The doctors called us in the evening. They said it was time. My parents were there. They held her hands. But I was scared. So very scared. And when I saw all the tubes connected to her tiny body - when I heard that awful beeping - when I smelled that chemical hospital scent - I couldn't stand it.\"\n\nThe brown haired girl took a long look at the bed, then turned and ran.\n\nTears cascaded down my cheeks. \"I wasn't there when she died. My mum found me afterwards, hiding in the gift shop. They said she wasn't in any pain when she passed. But I should have been there. My selfishness kept me away from her last moments in the world. I never got to tell her how much I loved her.\"\n\nThe Grief was taller than me know. Its stomach was bloated as it reached out and took me between its arms. I flinched as it pulled me towards its gaping mouth and monstrous fangs, but I didn't scream as it swallowed me whole.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up in my own bed.\n\nThe Grief was the size of a frog again. It sat beside me, waiting. It took me a while before I knew what to say.\n\n\"So now you know why I don't deserve to heal.\"\n\nIt sighed. I noticed its mouth was toothless again. \"And now you know why that isn't true at all.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? I... abandoned my own grandmother. I deserve nothing but the worst.\" I buried my head in my arms, but the tears would no longer come. \n\n\"You did what anyone would do in one of the worst moments of your life. Your nan would never hold it against you. Now, take a deep breath and think of all the good memories you had together.\"\n\nIt was like something burst in my chest. All the things the Grief had swallowed washed over me. My nan's smile and laughter, the scent of her perfume, the warmth of her embrace, the colour red. Everything came back in a rush of imperfect serenity.\n\n\"You have fed me with your grief, and I thank you for that. But now, it's time to take that grief and grow from it. Live a life that your nan would be proud of. People always say that grief lessens over time, but that's not true. We just grow bigger and bigger around it. That's what you need to do now. Make your nan proud. That's worth more than a single moment in a hospital ward.\"\n\nLifting my head felt like the heaviest thing in the world.\n\n\"But what if I don't deserve it?\"\n\nThe Grief sighed. \"Think of your nan. Would she want to see you in misery, every day for the rest of your life?\"\n\nI shook my head. Some kind of weight was beginning to lift from my shoulders.\n\n\"Of course not. Grief is a form of love. To grieve your nan, you must remember how much you love her every single day. That way, she will live on in the memories you have of her. It will never be enough, but it's the only way to survive.\"\n\nThere was nothing else I could say. I looked up at the stars, then down to the starry eyes of the Grief. Only one question remained in my mind.\n\n\"What are you going to eat now?\"\n\nThe Grief only smiled as it disappeared.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt's been weeks since the Grief left. Every day, I do something to honour my nan. Sometimes, I spray a bit of her perfume and the scent brings back a hundred memories. Other times, I simply glance at the photograph of her hanging in the hallway and it's enough to make me smile. Today, I decided to paint my nails red. \n\nI still feel grief. I still feel guilt. But the Grief taught me that I don't need to *only* feel these things. It's okay to be happy and excited and inspired and still mourn at the same time. \n\nI think my nan would like that.",

        "text": "As a child, I went to a small holiday village with my parents. My family was barely scraping by at that time, so it was a bunch of cheap houses and a small playground somewhere in the forest, not far from an abandoned factory.\n\nAlmost no one looked after the children, and we often ran away into the forest, to the realm of mysterious industrial ruins. What could have gone wrong, really?\n\nHooks, piles of shabby, rusty iron, whole torn off metal plates, which, apparently, they wanted to scrap, but were too lazy to drag, dilapidated buildings with huge gloomy machines. It felt that everything was sleeping in anticipation of something.\n\nThere was only one relatively well-preserved building. Apparently, it was the accounting department, administration, or something like that, but it was no longer possible to understand what exactly the two-story house with a triangular roof had previously served. The entrances were littered with debris, and all the windows were boarded up. Except one, right under the roof. Its glasses were shattered, the hole gaping with an empty black eye socket in a crumbling yellow face.\n\nAnd there was something in the eye. It looked at us. Barely noticeable during the day, but in the evenings, in the dark, we could clearly see two ellipses floating in the air and something similar to a cylinder above them.\n\nIt did not move and was always at the same point.\n\nIi didn't occur to me during that time that it was simply waiting.\n\nUsually we stared into the window, which was dark even on a sunny day, until we felt scared enough to rush back to the village. We ran a hundred meters and then, breathless, repeated how scary it all was, and discussed theories about what was really happening there. An alien? A spirit of a tortured worker? A creature from a parallel world?\n\nTo be honest, it was fun. Of course, the building looked at us menacingly, especially since we were small, and it was big, and the motionless spots in the darkness of the broken window were frightening. But it remained there, in an abandoned factory, mere hundreds of meters away from the holiday village where our parents were. If not waiting for us, at least just being there.\n\nWe had somewhere to go back.\n\nOne day, when we once again came to get spooked by the spots near the roof, the window was empty. Only impenetrable darkness - and nothing more.\n\nWe didn't run back, just walked. We talked about something and laughed, but awkwardly and unnaturally. We became uncomfortable. The Face in the Tall Hat seemed to be something permanent, unchanging. A safe, static secret of the vast and not-so-friendly world around us.\n\nFor a few more days, we could hardly fall asleep at night, thinking about the missing \"face\". However, nothing happened, and we gradually forgot about this story.\n\nBut the secret of the unfriendly world turned out to be by no means static and not at all safe.\n\nWhen I turned eighteen, I seemed to start seeing him again.\n\nIn the reflections on the glass of the windows, in the corner of my eye in the mirrors. A barely perceptible image flashing in the glare on the smartphone screen.\n\nThen I chalked it up to fatigue. The year turned out to be difficult, preparation for exams and graduation, problems in the family and other worries were piling up and squeezing my shoulders more and more. Of course you will start seeing things that scared you in the past.\n\nGradually, with each appearence in the reflections, the image became clearer and more distinct. Soon I could make out the details that I did not notice as a child.\n\nInside the yellow ellipses was a spiraling whirlwind that went into darkness towards the middle. Just like pupils.\n\nThin red threads were connected to the ellipses. Like vessels.\n\nBelow hung thin lips, two scarlet uneven pads, the corners of which were pointed down. And a black crack between them.\n\nAbove the “eyes” is an iridescent blue “cylinder” with uneven, blurry outlines.\n\nGlare on a smartphone. Reflection on the glossy ceiling that I stare at on sleepless nights. Mirror in my room. Reflection in a cup of coffee. Outside the subway window. On the window glass in the classroom. On some expensive metal-worked teacher's pen. On a huge mirror in the hallway. On the hoods of all the cars in the yard. On TV displays. On the surveillance cameras. On the mirror in the hallway. In glare on a plate. On the ceiling. In the window. On the mirror.\n\nBefore my eyes when I lower my eyelids.\n\nThe next day I didn't go to school. The image was everywhere. I couldn't take it anymore, I needed the closure. \n\nIn just half an hour of searching, I managed to find where this holiday village was. I have a good memory, and I remebered it wasn't too far from our old home.\n\nA train with something lurking in the reflections, then half an hour on a bicycle and another ten minutes of walking through the forest, with shadows around me.\n\nThe abandoned factory has not changed at all. Even the garbage laid in the exact same places as before.\n\nI scattered the rubble at the front door. The door did not yield immediately, it opened heavily, with a long groan.\n\nInside was clean and bright.\n\nThe building had modern minimmalistic design with smooth white walls, floors and ceilings. I saw my reflection on them, but not the face.\n\nNearby was a staircase. Also white. There were clearly more than two floors.\n\nIt was too late to turn back.\n\nI started up the stairs, one empty, unnaturaly clean floor after another.\n\nAfter a couple of dozen flights, oddly enough, there was no fatigue in my legs, the final scene was waiting for me. The closure I've been looking for, the ending I feared. In the middle of the white floor, a black spot stood out sharply on the floor.\n\nI stepped closer.\n\nIt was a whirlwind with blurry edges which we mistook for a tall hat.\n\nI didn't want to raise my eyes and look up, but something made me decide.\n\nIt was exactly what I expected to see.\n\nTwo huge elliptical eyes, looking at me with unblinking stare. Above them was a mouth, lips closing and opening, perhaps speaking words in a language I didn't know. \n\nI gazed fascinated from the inside at the upside-down, strangely twisted face that had haunted me since my childhood... until my lips tightened and the floor disappeared from under my feet.\n\nThe whirlwind expanded and I fell into it, into a bottomless space.\n\nI do not remember what happened next and how I returned home.\n\nI didn’t see the face again. \n\nIt saw me from the inside, as I saw it in that abandoned... factory? Was it really a factory, and not a trap for the selection of new flesh vessels?\n\nI feel it travel through me, move through my body. It is already in the neck and moving upward as I finish this post.\n\nSoon.\n\nSoon.",

        "text": "\nAs I'm sitting in my office, I began to notice strange things tonight. It's really foggy, like I'm talking silent Hill foggy and the warehouse I'm security at is off of an exit ramp with nothing but a gas station next to it. \n\nThere are sometimes where homeless people camp out at the station next door so seeing someone walking past on the cameras isn't something unusual. It's also Florida so there are the typical crazies here that come past. I've learned to pay them no mind. So having some action on the cameras isn't new. \n\nBut anyways, i was watching cameras and checking my emails. It's around 6:45am. My shift is almost over, so I just have to waste another 15 minutes. All was going smoothly until out of the corner of the camera that faces the trucks on the yard I saw movement. Now it's new years day, the warehouse is closed and all the drivers are home with their families so there isn't anyone here but me. So there shouldn't be any movement on the yard by the trucks as it is all fenced and gated in. \n\nDue to the fog though, I couldn't see who or what it was on the yard, Now I'm white, but not go check out that strange thing on the camera white, so I figured I'd just try to get a better view with the camera. That was until, the camera connection cut out. After that I tried to use the other cameras on that side of the property to see what happened but all camera connects were off on that side. \n\nSoon after I heard the alert for a door being opened. Shortly after that the lights went out in half of the building. So I went to go check on the service room to flip the breaker, that's when I found out what had caused the door alert to go off. There was a tall dark humanoid figure in the hallway between me and the breaker. \n\nThe figure almost looked like a tall man with elongated arms and legs. I could barely make out any facial features but it looked like it had sunken eyes and a flat nose. And when it moved it was almost like a stop motion picture of just like, snapping it's body into place. \n\nThat was until it started to move quicker towards me. Luckily there is a secondary security office next to the service room to use when the building is staffed and there is two of use security on shift. I quickly opened the door and locked myself in it. \n\nWhat a joy, starting 2023 with this luck, sometimes things just never go my way. I'm now sitting in our secondary security office as that thing is still out there. Making these strange creaking and groaning sounds. \n\nI love working night shift, but sometimes these things make me question if it's really worth the $32 an hour. I'm unarmed security so I have no way to defend myself from anything that goes bump in the night on my shift. \n\nFirst shift still hasn't came to relieve me yet and the clocks still say 6:45am. It's going to be a long 15 minutes.",

        "text": "There was this kid in my neighborhood called Ricky, and everyone hated him.\n\nI mean, it was kind of obvious. From his appearance right down to his personality and interests. He had what they called a ‘baby face’, fat and round like a tomato, with baby blue eyes, freckles and a mess of blonde hair that flopped over his face.\n\nI also never saw him below 120 pounds. He didn’t *walk*—he *waddled*—like a penguin who never quite figured out how to swim. Ricky never went around without his sketchbook, and he tried to make himself as small as possible, like that would help him at all.\n\nOf course, it didn’t. Ricky was a walking recipe for ridicule. He couldn’t walk one step without someone throwing something at him. He endured classes with laughter crashing around him. I heard he didn’t have it easy at home either, or with any of the adults, and it showed with the bruises on his arms and legs and shoulders and the way he walked, dragging his feet like a deflated balloon.\n\nI am sorry to say that I once participated in bullying Ricky. It was a necessity ritual in the school’s pecking order: do it or be bullied yourself. Eat or be eaten. That was how it worked.\n\nI felt really bad for doing it too. There were times when I really enjoyed it, to be brutally honest—he was just a walking punching bag—a perfect way to get out my stress, but the more I saw Ricky, the heavier my heart weighed with guilt.\n\nSo on the last day of school, I cornered Ricky in the boy’s bathroom, and without looking directly at him, handed him a pack of markers I had just bought from the arts shop.\n\nI quickly walked away then, not stopping to see how Ricky reacted to my impromptu gift. If my friends saw what I had just done, I would be dead meat for the rest of my life. But I think Ricky liked it. His small, fat frame straightened out, and his chest puffed out with hope. It was like he had come alive, like a flower just learning how to bloom.\n\nI deliberately avoided Ricky the rest of the day, snickering about him to my friends, but when I got home from school, I found the purple marker in my mailbox with a grateful letter of thanks wrapped around it in sloppy handwriting.\n\nI wondered how Ricky knew purple was my favourite colour.\n\nThe next time I saw Ricky with his markers was only a few hours later. The boys were over at my place and after playing board games we got bored and decided to get ice cream. It was a nice afternoon, and a cool breeze ruffled our hair.\n\nAnd there he was, holding his sketchbook and the markers I gave him, squatting next to a drain.\n\nHe was still in his school clothes, though it was hard to tell now since it was smeared with grime and filth. He also stank and everyone pinched their noses.\n\n“Hey Stinky Ricky!” Joe yelled.\n\nIn normal cases that would’ve caught Ricky’s attention. But Ricky was so distracted that he did not acknowledge us. \n\nI wondered who Ricky was talking to, and then I realised he was talking to the sewer drain. The manhole was open, the cover slanted to the side. Black smoke was rising rapidly into the air, like somebody was burning a fire inside. A murky stream trailed off into the distance.\n\n“Ricky?”\n\nNothing. Ricky’s eyes were glazed over.\n\n“Ricky!”\n\nI didn’t even know what else to say to get his attention. Alarm bells were blaring in my head.\n\n“Ricky! Watch out!”\n\nBeau and Joe were staring at me in shock. I knew I was going to get flak for it later, but if it meant saving him, it would be worth it.\n\nRicky looked up.\n\nHe smiled at me in a way that chilled me to the bone.\n\nThen he jumped.\n\nI couldn’t even hear the body hit the water.\n\nThere was silence for a while, as all three of us stared into the sewer drain. It was impossible to tell how deep it might have gone. We might as well be staring into a bottomless pit.\n\nWe weren’t sure what to do then. We thought and thought, debated whether we should tell somebody (would they believe us?) or keep it quiet (would it be our fault?).\n\nWe discussed and argued, argued and discussed, all the way home. And it could’ve gone on forever, if it weren’t for Joe’s scream.\n\n“RICKY!”\n\nBeau and I stopped abruptly, and stared at Joe, perplexed. Joe was frozen in the middle of the road. His knees were knocking together and his face was as white as a sheet.\n\nHis quivering fingers were pointing to thin air.\n\n“Joe,” I said shakily. That cold sick dread crept once again to my stomach. Although it was now around 3pm, the sky was darkening rapidly; the storm clouds cast a long shadow over our own.\n\n“There’s nothing there.”\n\nJoe snapped his head towards us, his eyes rolling to the back of his head until we could see the whites.\n\n“Don’t you see?” he screamed. “Ricky…he’s here! He’s mad at me!”\n\nHis eyes glazed over and that cold shiver slowly crept up my spine. I recognised that look. It was the same one Ricky gave me.\n\nBefore he jumped.\n\n“He calls me,” Joe muttered. He was rambling like a maniac. He looked past us and to the sewer drain.\n\n“I…I’m sorry, Ricky.”\n\nBefore either of us could stop him he was lumbering back to the sewer drain. But he didn’t have to go far. The water slid away from the drain like a serpent and pooled around his legs.\n\nWhich slowly and surely, sucked him in.\n\nJoe screamed again. Not Ricky’s name, but something else. Primal. Desperate.\n\nFor a minute we were frozen. Beau and I stared at each other.\n\nAnd then, as if we reached some unsaid agreement we ran over and tried to pull him out.\n\nIt was hopeless, however. Like trying to hold water. Joe gurgled, as the oil-like substance slipped into his mouth, his lungs. He was waving his arms like he was drowning.\n\nThen finally, the last of his arm slipped from our grasp and he was pulled under. The water dissipated, leaving behind a patch of dry concrete.\n\nThe sun began to shine.\n\nAgain we had no idea what to do. We knew Joe was gone, the same way Ricky was a few minutes earlier. We looked back at our neighborhood, a cold dread settling into our hearts.\n\nMy thoughts raced. I reached for my phone.\n\nMy vision blurred as I dialled mechanically.\n\n“911, what is your emergency?”\n\nI opened my mouth to speak, but the words were stuck in my throat.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nWhat should I say? That I just saw two boys taken by the sewers?\n\n“Hello? Hello?”\n\nI shook my head and hung up. Beau looked forlornly at me.\n\n“Let’s go home,” he said. He was taking this better than I was. I was grateful for that.\n\nThis time nobody talked. We just plodded home, eyes on the road. We did notice the sky though, the way the clouds furrowed its brows like a grumpy old man. That little patch of sunshine was brief, like an omen that was to come.\n\nAt some point the concrete turned into mush and mud, and oily water rushed over our shoes and closed around our ankles. I looked down and found we were knee-deep in the water, which gurgled and roared and thrashed against the walls of the houses. Through the murk I could see that every sewer drain was open and every manhole cover had disappeared, and it coughed out more and more water that seemed to slowly rise.\n\nI swallowed and felt the lump slide down into my stomach and sit there, ice-cold.\n\nThis wasn’t good.\n\nThen we got to my house, and that cold lump in my stomach slid back out. I turned and vomited into the water.\n\nRicky’s father was swinging in front of my windows. At first glance it appeared he had hanged himself—I could see a bit of rope looped around his neck and snaking back through the window. But then I looked closer, and I realised someone had hoisted him up there. A long trail of intestine poked out through a hole in the back and disappeared into the gaping darkness behind.\n\nBlood dripped out from his body and blossomed crimson in the water.\n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off it. The body swung, a figment of my nightmares forever. His head bent up and gave me a hideous grin behind dirty blonde hair.\n\nBeau gripped my hand until his knuckles were white. The water slithered around my ankles and crept up to my knees.\n\nI was so busy staring at Ricky’s father  swinging against my house that I realised what was going on, too late.\n\nI only remember a rush of colours as I was pulled under. The little patch of gray sky that grew increasingly smaller. Water rushed into my lungs.\n\nBesides me Beau was screaming Ricky’s name, like Joe before him. In fact, when I closed my eyes I could hear thousands of screams and sobs bursting through my head. Asking for mercy, forgiveness, regretting what they had done to Ricky, again too late.\n\nUnder the ground told a different story. The water was all rushing forward in a single direction, carrying bodies along with it. I saw kidneys, hearts, and a long trail of guts. Arms and legs, slightly chewed. Rats scuttled on the walls, occasionally diving into the water to retrieve a meal.\n\nAnd of course, whole corpses. I shivered when I recognised quite a few of them, including several of my classmates. Adults who I’d known and enjoyed bullying Ricky just as much as us kids.\n\nSwimming against the current was out of the question. The water had a death grip around my torso—literally. Whenever I looked down, I saw it looping ominously around my waist like a seatbelt.\n\nAll I could do was stare at the dim shadows and the water crashing against the walls and hope, with my heart in my throat, that Ricky would spare me in some way.\n\nBut I personally didn’t think so.\n\n***\n\nI saw the shadow first. It glimmered dimly against the wall, as if illuminated lightly by a candle.\n\nThen I saw a giant arm, as big and long and thick as tree trunks, come swooping down and scooping up Beau next to me. Beau’s screams disappeared in the darkness as he was swallowed whole.\n\nThe water crashed onto a bank, forming a makeshift beach. I was deposited onto a bank and the water retreated with a hiss. I groaned with pain, rubbing my head.\n\nColours clashed and my head spun as I struggled to regain my bearings.\n\nThen I saw everything, and I nearly fainted in fright.\n\nHe now towered impossibly above me, and his frame twisted and turned around the dead end. He was warped thin, fuelled by the oily water that wrapped around his body. His skin prickled with stiff hair that poked oddly out like sharp thorns.\n\nHis figure warped and twisted and shook, like wisps of smoke off a candle-flame.\n\nBut worst of all, I saw Ricky’s face stitched tightly to this *creature*. His blonde hair had disappeared into the watery abyss and his eyes were not what it used to be. But it was Ricky, all right. And Ricky stared down at me and hissed, and then roared so loudly every single hair on my body stood up on end.\n\nAnother giant hand bent down and scooped me up, and Ricky brought me so close to his face that I could smell his breath. Anger danced behind the whites of his eyes, lighting them up like fire.\n\n“Wait!” I yelled.\n\nRicky paused, stared at me and hissed. He waited.\n\n“I gave you the markers, remember?” I was blabbering like an idiot, and I was pretty sure I peed in my pants. My palms were sweating. I wasn’t really sure if Ricky was going to believe me, but it was my only hope.\n\nI pulled out the purple marker from my pocket and pressed it into his palm. The only sign of friendship I had ever given him.\n\n“Please…” I sobbed. God, I was crying. I had never thought I would be at Stinky Ricky’s mercy, but I hoped that I could find some compassion, some forgiveness, in the monster he was now.\n\nAs cheesy as it sounded.\n\n“I’ll do anything for you! I’ll be your friend!”\n\nI gave him a weak smile. \n\n“Just like you always wanted…”\n\nRicky seemed to consider it. The water turned the marker over in his palm.\n\n**TWELVE YEARS…**\n\nHe thought it over again, then frowned down at me. Tears welled in his eyes.\n\n**“Y-you really mean it??”**\n\nI nodded so eagerly my head nearly fell off.\n\n**“All right then,”** Ricky finally decided, and my heart sank in relief.\n\n**“But…”**\n\nMy heart froze up again. *What?*\n\n**“You have to do something for me.”**\n\n***\n\nEleven years.\n\nEleven years since I saw Ricky speak to a sewer. Eleven years since I was nearly eaten alive.\n\nEleven years since Ricky washed me up in this city far away from home. It wasn’t easy getting a job and trying to live on your own when you’re just sixteen, but somehow I managed. Especially when I couldn’t get the smell of the sewer out of my clothes.\n\nI have been busy paying off my debt ever since, or at least, that’s what I have decided to call it. I’m pretty sure it mostly means–to Ricky at least–that I really mean what I said. That I genuinely wanted to be Ricky’s friend.\n\nTo him it also mainly meant buying him gifts and talking to the sewers. I feel stupid doing it. I pray every day my colleagues don’t catch me red-handed doing it. I will be a laughing-stock for sure. Yet, if I forget to pay him a visit every day, Ricky sends me a timely reminder. My walls, splashed with blood, or a nice bit of intestine or spleen or kidney hanging out on my pillow. Two days of absence means someone close to me in this city dies. He personally makes me watch them jump into the sewer.\n\nI have never missed a visit to the sewer three days in a row.\n\nThis is the last year, I think. The last year when I have to prove my worth and my friendship to him. I’m not sure what I am going to do after that. I am more than keen to put my past with Ricky away and start anew, but I don’t think Ricky will let me. Not to mention at times I actually *look forward* heading down there to talk to him.\n\nBut for now I have one year of debt left.\n\nOne more year.\n\n[One more year until Ricky forgives me at last](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[SK](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/)",

        "text": "It was yesterday, well around half past five and I was driving home from work when my mother called. She’d finally gotten grandma and grandpa’s old house out in the archipelago sold, and wondered if I wanted to come out and celebrate; My siblings would come, and it was so long since we all saw each other. Maybe there was something I wanted to save?\r\n\r\nBetween us, there are many things I’d rather do than spending a Friday night with my dear mother, but that I didn’t have the heart to say. The worry of not being able to sell her parents’ home had been a heavy burden for her which had only grown as winter approached, and I understand her; with today’s interest rates and electricity prices it’s hard enough to keep one household afloat. \r\n\r\nSo I told her that I was happy to come but that I didn’t want anything. Everyone could take what they wanted, but if there was anything of value we could split it. \r\n\r\nYeah, that she would tell them, but still asked me to think about it on the way out; Grandpa had the whole boathouse full of things and it’d be such a shame to throw it all away. \r\n\r\nThe boathouse, I thought, and felt my stomach tingle. I hadn’t been there in probably twenty years; That the old shed was still standing upright was the closest thing to a wonder. \r\n\r\nI promised her to think about it and then excused myself with the fact that I’d rather not be on the phone while I was driving. She thought that was sensible and ended the conversation by telling me to drive carefully. \r\n\r\nAs soon as she hung up, my mind went back to the boathouse. As a kid I always spent the summer holidays at grandma and grandpa’s, and if I wasn’t fishing, I was with Grandpa and helped him in his haunt. There was always something that needed to be done. It could be anything from fixing nets to build lobster pots (which was pretty boring chores, really), but it was there — there and nowhere else — that he told his stories, something I learned when we were out fishing for mackerel an early summer evening almost three decades ago. \r\n\r\nWe laid a nautical mile west of the island on a spot that always used to be good, but hadn’t felt a nibble in over half an hour, when I started to get bored. I looked at Grandpa where he was sitting in the stern, his back resting against the outboard and with a fishingline in each hand, and wondered if he, too, wasn’t a little bored. So I broke the silence and asked him if he couldn’t tell me a story while we waited. I joked and said that if he did, the mackerel might come and listen too. Grandpa gazed towards the horizon, his forhead furrowed like the sea during the midday breeze, and I could see that the question made him uncomfortable. Did I say something wrong? Before I got around to ask him, he looked at me and said: “No point in being out here today. Let’s go home, shall we?”\r\n\r\nStunned by him being the first to give up, I just nodded and wound up the line. I thought that maybe he wasn’t feeling well, but didn’t dare to ask. By the time I was done and had secured the hooks, Grandpa had already gotten up both his lines and was in the process to start the outboard. The old workhorse started on the first try — as usual — and we took of as fast the six horsepowers allowed. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until we were back in the boathouse that Grandpa finally opened his mouth again. He put the bucket with the fishing gear on the floor and told me to come over. When I reached him, he crouched down so that both our heads were leveled. and then put his big fisherman hands on my shoulders. The blue-grey eyes, watery as the ocean it self, stared into mine. \r\n\r\n“We never talk about such things outside of these walls, understood?”\r\n\r\nAt first I didn’t understand what he meant, but thought that it must’ve been that about the story out in the boat, and nodded silently. The grip around my shoulders softened and he gave me a little smile. He ruffled my hair, and then arduously rose up to his feet and took my hand.\r\n\r\n“Do you see that?” He said, pointing on an carved symbol above the door that looked like a pretzel. “It’s a troll cross that will keep the dark forces away. There’s another one.” Grandpa pointed towards the window. “Nothing that isn’t welcome can come in here.”\r\n \r\nWell, that’s how I found out exactly how superstitious Grandpa really was. That he wouldn’t go beneath ladders nor allow keys on the table and such, I knew, but not more than that. \r\n\r\nTwo hours later I finally arrived and drove of the ferry. The darkness had settled over the island, and in front of me the house windows lit up like stars in the night. The harbor bathed in the orange glow from the streetlights, but out on the street not a soul could be seen. Although only a couple of hundreds lived there year-round, you’d usually bump into at least some people — especially on a Friday. Maybe they were still on their way home from work, or maybe there was some big game on TV?\r\n\r\nI rolled on through the harbor and quickly realized how much things had changed since I’d last been there. On a patch of grass where the boats used to stay over the winter, a row of boathouses, big as smaller houses, had now been erected. With their two storeys, garage, and ocean view, they surely had costed a smaller fortune, but would probably stay empty for the most of the year. The so-called boathouses didn’t fit in at all in the otherwise so unpretentious archipelagic idyll, and for the first time I understood what the old people had meant with that it was better back in the days.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fancy sheds, the old wharf was still intact except for a few cracks and holes in the concrete, but the fishing boats were long gone. The commercial fishermen had been a dying breed for decades, and where boats once moored, only the bollars remained. \r\n\r\nI left the abandoned docking area and continued towards the heart of the harbor where I was greeted by yet another change. The small area that once was covered in gravel, and where I as child had danced around the midsummer pole so many times, had now been asphalted and made into a parking lot. The modernization of the island had probably been inevitable for it to not completely lose it’s appeal, but the impressions I’d received so far had not been positive. \r\n\r\nI parked the car and stepped out into the salty ocean air. Out by the pier, the waves that the ferry had brought up crashed into the boulders that surrounded the harbor, making a booming sound, but apart from that it was as quiet as the grave; A nice break from the constant noise back in the city. \r\n\r\nDown by the marina some dinghies were still rocking in the black water. Most would probably survive the winter, but when the ice melted again at least one of them would rest on the sandy sea bottom. I stepped down onto the jetty and headed towards the other side. At the far end, with one half perched on a rock\tand the other protruding above the water, grandpa’s boathouse safely stood and rested on it’s buttresses. I smiled. The mere sight of the old shed made me feel like a child the day before Christmas, but even though I suspected that Grandpa hadn’t shown me all of the boathouse secrets, I tried to persuade myself not to be too dissapointed if it turned out that I was wrong. \r\n\r\nOnce at the door, I stopped and looked at the weatherd façade. Unlike the rearmament that was going on around the bigger harbor, here the time had stood still; Everything looked exactly the same way as it always had: the red, flaky paint, the door made of nailed together planks, the paper-thin window that shook at the slightest gust of wind — Even the rack for the fyke nets was still there!\r\n\r\nI took the the key that was hanging from a nail next to the window that I’d asked mom to hang there, and stuck it into the lock. Here, in the archipelago, they rarely lock the doors, but that was the only way to keep the door to the boathouse closed. Grandpa had tried with hasps several times, but once the west wind flexed it’s muscles, they never had the strength to resist  which the marks on the outer wall could tell. \r\n\r\nThe door slid open with a creaking sound. In front of me the boathouse was shrouded in darkness, uplit only by a faint glow coming through the window. Luckily, my mother had thought about that and had put a flashlight on the floor, right inside the door. I turned on the light and stepped onto the floor that had once been part of the deck of grandpa’s fishing boat, Siljan. The scent of tar still lingered in the old wood and hung in the air like an invisible mist. By the foot of the long side opposed to me, stacks of torn fyke nets were piled up against the wall as it had been doing for as long as I could remember. It was a never ending project that only grew no matter how many you managed to fix. The beam of light wandered towards a couple of pale life jackets that had already lost their glaring colors back when I used to use them, to a dozen lobster pots with way to small escape openings to be allowed to used with today’s strict fishing regulations. Seeing the old fishing gear I myself had fished with so many years ago made me warm inside, and I was fascinated by how untouched everything had been left. If time had stood still on the outside, it had definitely spread to the inside aswell. \r\n\r\nI continued looking around and caught sight of the tackles that was hanging in the window, and went over. Clad in cobwebs and layers of dust, they still managed to glisten in the flashlight’s glow: yellow, green, red. The hooks, however, were worse; The barbs were brown with rust and surely would break if you tried to lift them from the mullion’s. To see if I was right, I reached out for a herring-like jig, and was just about to grab it, when a shadow swept past outside the window. Frightened by the sudden movement, I jumped and hit the knee on an upside-down wooden bin Grandpa had used as a table. A schnapps glass that had been resting on it tipped and fell to the floor, shattering. “What the hell was that?” I thought. I leaned forward and looked through the window, but the only thing moving was a ripple on the oily surface of the harbor basin. I shook my head and smiled to myself, thinking it must’ve been a cat. \r\n\r\nBefore I went on exploring, I bent down to pick up the the very largest shards. If I knew myself I’d probably step on a piece otherwise, having to seek medical care, and that was not something I’d rather do than visit my mother on a day off. I picked up the pieces I could see and put them in an empty can of paint, when I caught something in the corner of my eye: in the side of the bin’s gray wood was hiding a hatch! Excited by my discovery, I moved closer and pointed the flashlight to the closure; had it not been for a little brass hasp I never would’ve found it. \r\n\r\nI lifted the cover aside and peered into box. Hidden in the darkness, the contour of something cylindrical could be seen, and didn’t take long before I realized what it was. Smiling at grandpa’s shrewdness, I stuck my hand into the hole and lifted out a bottle of vodka Explorer, his favorite beverage. Grandpa was a thirsty man and took a sip as soon as Grandma looked the other way. \r\n\r\nTo make sure I hadn’t missed anything inside the box, I shone the light into the hole one more time. When I was just about to move on, I spotted something carved into the wood: a five centimeter long cross. Unlike the troll crosses Grandpa had shown me earlier, this was something he had kept to himself. Maybe he just wanted to keep the stash a secret, but as a  Christian, I think he was somewhat ashamed of his drinking and maybe the cross was an attempt at forgiveness for his sins?\r\n\r\nCurious as to what more secrets the bin might hold, I stood up to turn it over, but first I wanted to see if the troll crosses was still there. I pointed the light to the space between the door and the roof. At first I couldn’t see the carving, but there, hidden behind a layer of mold, a piece of the symbol peeked out. I followed the infested plank over to the window where the other troll cross was supposed to be, and found that the mold had taken hold there, too. Maybe that part was more exposed to the humidity, or maybe the wood wasn’t properly impregnated? Regardless of what, that part would have to be replaced so that the mold didn’t spread. \r\n\r\nI returned to the wooden box and turned it over so that its bottom rested against the floor. At the same moment the underside thudded against the floor, a hissing sound could be heard. Instinctively, I turned my gaze towards the window where the shadow previously had swept by, but saw to my great relief only the dark depths of the night sky and thought that it must’ve been the god damned cat again. \r\n\r\nWith the flashlight pointed down into the box, I let the light wander between the walls in seach of more symbols. The curiosity and enthusiasm for new discoveries that had previously been so palpable, had now been replaced by a desire to simply ascertain myself that there were no more remarkable things to be found. The whole operation had been a stupid idea and it felt like a had broken an implicit promise between me and Grandpa, but I had to finish what I’d started; otherwise I would go and brood over this for the rest of my life. \r\n\r\nWhen only one wall remained and I still hadn’t discovered anything new, I felt the courage come back again. The shadow and the strange sound hade only been my mind playing tricks on me, maybe because I so desperately had wanted to find something mysterious. So I kept searching the last side of the bin where I had seen the cross — the faster I finished, the sooner I could leave. Shortly there after, part of the carving appeared in the yellow light. At the same time, the air grew colder, and I was filled with a feeling of discomfort, as if something didn’t want me there. With a trembling hand I continued to move the flashlight until the whole cross was illuminated, and discovered that it stood upside down. Next to it were scratch marks that hadn’t been there minutes before, and they were definitely not from a fucking cat. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I could feel the skin crawl on my arms — I had to get ouf of there, now. I turned around and hurried towards the exit, heart pounding as if I were subjecting my body to somehting physically demanding and it was about to overexert itself, but I couldn’t stop now; I could rest in the car or out on the jetty — anywhere but here. \r\n\r\nAlmost out of the boathouse, so close that I could stretch an arm out into the fresh air, the door slammed shut right in front of my face. I crashed into the planks, arms in front of me, and dropped the flashlight. It hit the floor with a thud, and went out. Darkness swept in over the boathouse. As my eyes tried to adjust to the gloominess, I could hear the flashlight roll away across the floor, dissappearing deeper into the shadows. Paralyzed with terror, I tried to regain control over my body when the sound of nails dragging against wood could be heard. The fear sent shiver down my spine and I screamed for someone to come and help me. After a couple of seconds, I finally regained the ability to move. I banged on the door and continued to scream so loud that my throat hurt. Behind me, something heavy dragged itself across the floor, filling the boathouse with the stench of something dead. When my hands had become so sore that I thought they were going to fall off, and my vocal cords burned with pain, I threw myself into the door. The door shook and the planks almost gave way, so I tried again, but with no luck. The slithering sound was right behind me now, and down at my feet I could hear a heavy breathing, as if something was choking and struggled for air. In a last desperate attempt to get out, I brought my knee up to my stomach and kicked the handle. \n\nThe door flew open and slammed into the façade so violently that it sent an echo across the harbor. I threw myself out of the boathouse and ran towards the car without looking back — I neither wanted nor dared to see if anything was after me. Once at the car, I jumped in and drove to the ferry at such high speed that I doubt I would have time to give way, should someone been unfortunate enough to stand in the way. Fortunately, I was still alone out there, and when I arrived at the ferry queue I saw to my great relief that a ferry was just about to dock. I drove on board, and texted my mother that I suddenly had felt nauseous and was on my way home again. I wrote that there had been a strange smell in the boathouse and that maybe that was the reason to why I didn’t feel so well; it was probably for the best that noone went there until it had properly been aired out. \r\n\r\nNow almost twentyfour hours has passed, and I still haven’t dared to turn on the phone. I dread that mother didn’t listen to what I said and went into the boathouse anyway, but I’m in no condition to speak; I haven’t slept a wink since I got home, because wherever I look, I can see a shadow in the corner of my eye.",

Ollie stood in place, unable to keep his eyes off the severed arm on the ground, dried blood oozing from the cut and pooled around the limb itself. The arm had a chunk bitten out of it, letting parts of the bone poke through. In fact, a good portion of the arm was bone at that point, thanks to the vultures, but I could still see each individual, dirty, greying finger that made it extremely clear as to what I was looking at.\n\n“Ollie, we need to g—”\n\nBefore I was able to continue, a deafening blast came from the lower floor and a spray of wood erupted right in front of us, a fair-sized hole forming in the floor. I screamed and Ollie immediately grabbed onto my arm and pulled me forcefully to the other side of the room, hopping over the hole in the ground.\n\n“You little bastards need to get the fuck out of my house! I’m gonna blow your brains out all over the walls!” A strong, raspy male voice called from downstairs. I was shaking at this point and I wanted to vomit, but I was completely frozen and unable to do anything other than stand huddled up against Ollie behind a pile of crates in the back right corner.\n\nThe smell coming from this area was impossibly strong and I knew it had to be the source of the stench. Ollie held onto my shoulder tightly as he panned his flashlight down to our feet, which is when we noticed we were crouching in what looked like a pool of thick, fleshy blood. I screamed again and leapt forward, crashing into the boxes and sending them flying across the floor. I scratched my elbows pretty badly, and the pain mixed with the panic made me start crying. I sat up and shined my light at Ollie and noticed the top half of a body laying across the floor, the stomach gutted open like a fish, and two bloody stumps where the arms were supposed to be. The head was caved inward, like the person had been bashed in the face with an anvil. Nothing about the body looked human anymore. Ollie covered his mouth with his hand and I watched his chest rise and lower sporadically as he started to hyperventilate, and he stood up in what seemed to be the mauled remains of the corpse’s legs. He stumbled over to me and landed on the ground beside me, staring wide-eyed at something. I flung my head over my shoulder and saw that the crates had broken open when I fell into them, and they were filled with brownish, rotting bones. Hundreds of bones, now scattered across the ground, making up more area on the floor than wood. I let out another wailing cry and hugged Ollie’s arm tightly, thinking that this nightmare couldn’t get any worse than it already was.\n\nThat was when we heard the sound of pounding footsteps making their way up the stairs.\n\n“April, we have to jump out the window,” Ollie said, his voice strained. I could tell he was crying at this point, too. “It’s gonna hurt, but we don’t have any other option. You go first.”\n\n“Ollie—” I started, before I saw the dark figure of a man arrive at the top of the stairs. He was huge, definitely above six feet, and he had a sort of beer gut. His eyes were bugged like a madman, open wider than I thought was humanly possible. He had a scruffy beard that had flakes of grey in it. It was definitely the neighbor, but somehow he looked like a totally different person at this point in time. He smiled when he saw us, his teeth long and yellowed. He aimed the gun at us.\n\n“My vultures are gonna have a *feast* tonight,” he growled.\n\n“Go!” Ollie screamed, pushing me as hard as he could. He ducked down and laid on his stomach as he shoved me, and I landed hard on my already hurt elbows. Another shot rang out, louder this time, and I felt wood splinters rain on my side from the wall to my left as another hole was blown into the house. I picked myself up and, using nothing more than pure adrenaline, hurled myself toward the window. I grabbed the top of it and hopped onto the bottom of the frame before I slipped my arms outside. I looked over my shoulder inside the house one last time and saw Ollie making a mad dash for the window as well, only for his foot to get caught in the hole that was shot in the floor. I was already pulling myself back into the house when the neighbor cocked his shotgun again. Ollie looked up at me desperately. “Please go!” His scream ripped through his throat and planted itself into my brain. I took his words to heart and repositioned myself to where I was before, with my hands against the soft, brittle wood of the outside of the building, looking out into the night on the edge of the window frame. I pressed my hands against the side of the house and pushed off, falling to the ground below me. I landed a few feet away from the crate I used to get into the house, feeling my ankle twist from under me. I cried out in pain, my throat scratching and burning. All I felt was a blinding pain in every part of my body at that point, but I was quickly pulled out of my daze when I heard another gunshot, followed by a blood-curdling, ear-piercing scream come from Ollie.\n\nIt was a sound that was so foreign to me; he had never sounded so terrified, so hopelessly scared and hurt in my entire time of knowing him. There was a lot of loud banging coming from inside, and lots of grunts and struggling. I curled up into the fetal position where I had landed and cried silently to myself, staring with an unblinking gaze at the window I leapt out of. I cried even harder, so hard that no noise came out and my chest spasmed as it forced every last tear out of my body when I heard another gunshot, then a thump, then silence. I squeezed my legs tightly and pushed my eyes into my knees, not being able to process what I had just heard. Drool poured over my lips and my nose was running like crazy, but I didn’t care enough to wipe any of it away. I had given up at that moment, which is why I also didn’t move when I heard footsteps make their way to the window. I sat there and waited for the neighbor to shoot me, for everything to go dark and for my brain to shut off in an instant. At that point, I was ready for anything if it meant not having to go on without my best friend. My brother.\n\n“The hell are you doing? Get back to your house, dipshit!”\n\nMy head bolted up when I heard that and I was met with the sweaty, pale, blood-splattered face of Ollie, leaning weakly against the window frame. He was panting like a dog, but I saw him try to play his lips into some semblance of a smile. I felt like such a crybaby, because I couldn’t stop myself from crying out of relief. I forced myself to stand, almost collapsing from how badly my legs were shaking.\n\n“Are you okay?” I yelled, each word I spoke making me cry harder.\n\n“He shot me. He shot my foot. It hurts. A lot. But I’m gonna be okay, I’ll go down the stairs and bust the front door open. Go inside and call the cops. Get an ambulance too.” He looked down for a moment, presumably inspecting his injured foot. He lowered a little, seeming like his body was about to give out on him. “Fuck, I’m gonna puke.”\n\n“I’ll go get help,” I said, then turned around and sprinted towards my house. My ankle hurt like a bitch, but more adrenaline kicked in as I ran, so I quickly forgot about the pain. I was crying, yet smiling at the same time as I ran. All the terror I had just experienced melted away into incredible comfort knowing that Ollie was okay. He even called me a dipshit, so I knew he was still sort of himself, even if he was badly hurt. I laughed to myself when I thought about that. There was nothing I wanted to do more than hug Ollie; I wanted to sit on the couch and just hold onto him like I was going to lose him. Because I really thought I had lost him. But first I knew that he needed help with something that I couldn’t help with, so I dragged myself out of my mind and focused on reality again.\n\nI burst through the backdoor and was met with my mom putting paper grocery bags on the kitchen island. She looked at me with a slight smile, which quickly faded when she realized the state I was in.\n\n“April? Honey, what’s wrong, what happened?” She asked quickly, releasing the bags and jogging over to me. She held my face with her hands and paled faster than I had ever seen anyone go pale. I was still breathing heavily with tear stains on my face and blood caked on my arms. I would be terrified if I saw my child run through the door looking like that, too. I could hardly bring up the right words to say.\n\n“Police… call the cops… the police… Ollie needs amb- an ambulance.” I stretched my arm out and pointed out the backdoor. “The house. The neighbor, he’s killing people. Us, he almost killed *us*.”\n\n“What’s going on?” My dad said as he came around the corner, lifting his reading glasses onto his head. My mom looked back at him and moved her hands to my shoulders.\n\n“Call 911. Get an ambulance. The neighbor did something.” She spoke matter-of-factly, despite her voice wavering heavily. Not waiting another second to question the situation, my dad nodded and raced over to the landline on the other side of the kitchen. As he talked to the police, my mom held onto me tightly and caressed my head, trying to help me calm down. I was shaking like a leaf, and despite my mom’s calming words and shushing, I just couldn’t sit still. I was like that until the backdoor swung open forcefully and I saw a beat-up, bloody, utterly exhausted Ollie stumble in.\n\n“Ollie!” I said, breaking free from my mom’s hug and running over to him. I hugged him tighter than I had ever hugged him before, letting his curls dance around my fingers and the beads of sweat come off on my hand, the heavy rising and falling of his chest and he panted into my ear. I didn’t care how gross and dirty he must’ve been. I was just happy he was alive.\n\n“April, hi,” he said, his voice hoarse and weak. He returned the hug, thereby letting off most of his weight onto me. “I need to sit down.” I looked down at his foot, remembering what he said, and had to bite my tongue to keep myself from screaming. His foot was nothing more than a bloody stump with the hoodie he previously had around his waist tied as tightly as it could go around it. I nearly let go of him, but gained composure again when I felt him start falling. My mom rushed over and helped me get Ollie to a chair at the kitchen table, and my dad, having been done with the call to the police for a few minutes now, ran off somewhere else in the house. I didn’t know what he was doing until he came back with a box of gauze and a bottle of antiseptic.\n\n“This won’t hold up for long, but it should help, at least until the ambulance gets here. You’ll be alright, son, just hold on for a minute.” He crouched down in front of Ollie and untied his hoodie, grimacing at the sight the piece of clothing was covering.\n\nHis foot was still there, sort of. He had three toes left and a giant chunk of the side of his foot had been taken off, and you could see a bit of bone sticking out, but you could tell it used to be a foot. I had to look away and was only able to offer the comfort of my hand to hold when my dad said “This is gonna hurt, kid,” before pouring the antiseptic onto the wound. My mom rubbed Ollie’s back as he screamed, the sound coming out gritty and rough, as if his voice were already gone completely and he was forcing some foreign exclamation of pain out of his torn-up throat. He squeezed my hand so hard that by the time my dad had put the gauze on, I could see clear fingernail prints in the palm of my hand. It hurt, but I knew I was in nowhere near as much pain as Ollie was. When I looked back at him he was crying, holding his free hand up to his face. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and cried again with him, but I didn’t have any more tears left.\n\nThe cops came pretty quickly, but then again I wasn’t really keeping track of time at that point. They ushered Ollie into the ambulance as soon as they saw the state he was in, and they brought me in there with him as well, letting me sit on the edge of the car with my feet dangling outside the open doors. The paramedics did a quick check-up on me and cleaned up the scratches on my elbows, placing two big bandaids over them. Once they were done, I hopped out of the car and watched as they sped off to the hospital with my best friend, who I thought was bleeding to death at the time. The cops remained and asked me a bunch of questions about what we had been doing and what we saw in the house, and I hold them the whole truth about everything, from the moment we decided to sneak into the house to when I saw Ollie get stuck in the hole in the floor before jumping out the window. Unsurprisingly, the cops immediately left to go investigate the house, and when they came back they reported what they found to us. The neighbor was lying on the ground, his head — or what was left of it — resting on the first step of the stairs. It was clear that his cause of death was being shot by the shotgun at quite a close range.\n\n“Ollie,” I muttered. “Ollie got him.” I looked up at the cops. “But he had to! He was going to die if he didn’t!”\n\n“We know, sweetheart,” one of the cops said. He was tall and had pasty skin with a handlebar mustache, and he looked vaguely preoccupied with the note he was writing. “We aren’t gonna punish him for that. The only thing we care about right now is making sure that foot of his gets patched up.”\n\n“When will I get to see him? When will he come home?” The officer clicked his tongue and shook his head.\n\n“Not sure yet, honey. His foot got pretty messed up, so it’s gonna take awhile to help fix him up.”\n\n“But he’s going to be okay,” a lady officer with light brown skin and dark coily hair pulled up into a bun said, placing her hands on my shoulders gently. “He’ll be back to you in no time. And I’m sure he’d love a visit from you at the hospital.” She smiled at me, and I somehow managed to smile back.\n\nThe investigation concluded not even a week after the initial incident, but I wasn’t allowed to learn anything super in-depth about it, which I thought was sorta bullshit. But essentially, the neighbor had several bodies hidden around his old barn house that he never tore down, and all those crates, including the ones outside and the ones I stood on to get inside the building, were full of the leftover bones from his victims. Everyone involved believes his main motive was simply to feed his “pets” he had gathered, aka the vultures. It’s such a screwed-up situation, and I hate that we couldn’t get any deeper detail about the whole ordeal, but I guess I’m just glad all that shit is over.\n\nOllie stayed in the hospital for eight days before he was released. I visited him every single one of those days. His wound hadn’t gotten infected, which was incredible, considering the cleanliness of the old house. He ended up having to get his foot amputated at the ankle, and he was given a prosthetic one to replace it. Naturally, he wasn’t very happy about it, but I tried my best to cheer him up, saying he’d look like some kind of cool cyborg superhero. That made him smile, and throughout the duration of his stay we made up a story about the boy with a bionic foot who now had incredible kicking strength and beat up a bunch of bad guys. He also told me what went down after I had jumped out the window. Basically, the guy had shot the foot that was stuck in the hole, which sort of helped him out by letting him get the rest of his leg out of the floor. Before the guy could shoot at him again he grabbed the barrel of the gun and pointed it at the ceiling, repeatedly punching the man in the stomach, then in the throat, until he was able to make the neighbor lose his grip on the gun. He fell back to the ground and aimed at his head and shot blindly, killing him instantly. I was so taken aback by the story, and all I could do was tell him how awesome he was over and over again. By the time he was released, he gained a little bit of himself back and started making jokes about his foot, which always cracked me up. He was taking a very positive outlook on it, and I was proud of him for that.\n\nNot everything was peachy again, though. He quit wanting to do taxidermy because it reminded him of the event too much. He also had days where he’d just sit quietly for a few minutes, staring at his artificial foot. He was very open about his feelings with me, however, and would tell me that he just felt off. He felt different and thought he was some type of freak.\n\n“Freak? Ollie, you’re the coolest fucking kid I know,” I told him once, about a week after he was released. He laughed.\n\n“I thought you didn’t like using language like that.”\n\n“I don’t care! I don’t know how else to express just how cool of a person you are. You’re different now, sure, but you’re still *you*. You’re Oliver Hartford, the kid who shot a guy in the face and escaped with a blown-off foot. You’re Ollie, the guy that saved my life, and the guy I’ll never be able to thank enough for still being here with me.” Ollie smiled genuinely for the first time that whole day and looked at me.\n\n“Thanks, April. I’m really glad to be here with you too.”\n\nNow that taxidermy wasn’t his thing anymore (which I ended up quitting, too, though I still occasionally helped my dad with it when he would work on a project), Ollie switched to poetry. I guess those English classes really did rub off on him. He was shy to share his poems at first, but he eventually got to the point where he would be so excited to read them to me that he’d sit me down and make me listen right then and there, no matter what I was doing. And I did listen. I listened to every word he said and appreciated it, not just because he was actually an incredible writer with great description and emotion in his work, but because I just liked hearing his voice. I liked hearing him excited and like himself again. I liked hearing him alive.\n\nHere’s a poem of his that he read to me and gave me a copy of:\n\n*“You are the green in the trees*\n\n*The blue water flooding the pond*\n\n*The yellow beams of sun*\n\n*The one that makes the blood spill worth it*\n\n*And even through the darkest, inkiest nights*\n\n*And the cloudy, sunless days*\n\n*Your caring hands hold me close*\n\n*All of my flesh and all of my metal*\n\n*And it makes all the blood spill worth it”*",

        "text": "When we got to the new house, Rose was beyond excited. She immediately rushed to the old swing that hung from the crooked tree in front of the house. “Mommy, look at high I can go!” she yelled. I looked at her with relief.  I wasn’t sure if she would accept moving to a new city after the death of her father—my husband, Chris. Our new house was fairly small and was surrounded by a large wheat field.  As I watched Rose swing, I noticed a grey figure in the corner of my eye standing in the wheat field, but when I looked there was nothing and no one there. “Must be seeing things” I told myself, but I felt as though I was being watched. I yelled at my daughter to come inside and get settled, she did just that. \n\n    After a while I decided it would be best to tour the nearby city with Rose so we could get familiar with it. We both hopped in the truck and I turned the key to the ignition. “I miss daddy” said Rose, I responded “I do too”.  Right before I pulled out of the driveway I noticed something in the rear view mirror. A small grey child standing in the window that peered into the living room. In the brief glance I got, I could make out that there were large black orbs in place of its eyes, its skin was a grey color, it had no mouth, no hair, no ears, no clothes, and no other body parts. I blinked and it was gone, I kind of felt a little creeped out but decided that it was just in my head. I drove away from the house and towards the city.\n\n    After getting familiar with the city, it started getting late, so I drove back home. Rose jumped out of the truck and ran to the front door. She opened the door and right before she ran inside, she stopped and started to cry.  I ran to comfort her and looked inside. My husband’s decapitated head was resting on a small\ntable set in front of the door. My heart began to race. I hurried Rose back to the truck and hopped in the driver’s seat. As I began to to drive away I saw the child again, standing in the wheat field, staring. But this time, he didn’t go away he stayed there and stared as I drove off. I called the police and gave them my address.\n\n   The police searched my house, but they didn’t find a head or any signs of forced entry.  I told them about the kid I kept seeing in the wheat field but they just recommended me to a therapist and left.  I decided that it was probably just some sort of hallucination like the grey kid. “But how could me and my daughter hallucinate the same thing?” I thought.  I disregarded this thought and me and Rose went back inside. I tucked her in and kissed her goodnight. “I’m scared” she said. “Don’t worry sweetie, whatever we saw probably wasn’t real.”\n\n   Morning came. I stayed up all night, I couldn’t sleep. I heard the front door open, I jumped out of bed and rushed to my daughter’s room, she was gone. I ran to the front door and saw out the window that my daughter was swinging on the swing, and behind her, stood the grey child, who had now formed a mouth, a smile. I slammed open the door but as I went outside they were gone, both my daughter and the grey child. I called the police again and reported my child missing.\n\n-1 week later-\n\nI couldn’t sleep, again. I pulled myself out of bed and made myself a coffee. Just then, I heard something coming from outside. A rope being tightened. I run to the front door as fast as I can and slam it open. The swing was gone, in its place was a single rope, a noose, and hanging from the noose, was Rose. Her throat and wrists slit. Beside her stood the grey child in the wheat.",

        "text": "It’s me again, and I’m sure the first question on your mind is *Ian, have there been any more murders?*\n\nOr maybe it’s *Ian, has Henri released you from your alcohol-filled prison to let you run any errands, and if so, did you jump again?*\n\nLet’s just get those answers out of the way right now: yes, and no. Meaning, yes, more murders, and no, I remain confined to Griffin’s Edge. With even more of a watchful lilac gaze on me than usual, due to my increasing instability and the aforementioned murders.\n\nBecause, yeah, they’re still going. In the last [two weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zp8zzy/siren_song_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), three more inhuman beings have turned up murdered. Word is starting to spread; the bar is a *lot* more crowded on weekdays now than it usually is, because creatures and beings from all over Neverland are coming here for solace and safety. No one would kill someone on the bar’s premises. Certainly not with Henri around.\n\nBut while the bar may be safe, its reach can only extend so far. Five murders total now, and no one is any closer to solving who’s behind them. I see the clusters of ancient beings conversing in corner booths, speaking languages older than Latin whose words hurt your head upon their mere utterance. I notice the messages Henri slips to these beings as they leave, folded notes in his looping handwriting, scrawled on Griffin’s Edge napkins. And I hear Uncle Henri late at night, whispering to himself as he scours book after book in his office.\n\nIt's through all this that I know they’re *trying,* but that they’ve come up with nothing. Even the wisest of them don’t have a clue. There are no signs of any murderer in Neverland; it’s like he appears, stabs someone, and then vanishes from existence once more, until the next death.\n\nNeedless to say, I have not been allowed to leave. I’ve insisted that I could help hunt him down—I’m probably the most experienced dimensional traveler out there, so I could cover a lot of ground very fast—but each time, I’ve barely spoken two words before the look Henri gives me shuts me up. He’s scared. He’s never seen a Neverland serial killer before, let alone one impossible to track, and it worries him. He hides it when he comforts our patrons, but his smile never reaches his eyes these days. \n\nAnyway, not much more I can say about that. I don’t *know* much more. \n\nBut since I’m still cooped up and getting bored again (these long stretches of me being grounded are really getting to me), I thought I’d tell you about my holidays instead.\n\nNow, I’m sure you know some of the most famous entities that emerge along with the Christmas trees, menorahs, and shiny red bows in December. Santa Claus, for instance. Maybe even the Yule Cat or Belsnickel or Perchta, depending on your culture. There are plenty of famous holiday visitors in the world—some nice, some naughty, some in-between.\n\nMost don’t exist, as far as I know. They’re only legends made up by humans, passed down by generations to scare their children into good behavior. \n\nBut legends have to come from *somewhere.* \n\nI’ve said before that most humans would combust within a few minutes of being in Neverland, and vice versa for supernatural beings in the human world. That’s absolutely true, except for yours truly, of course. There are a few…exceptions, though.\n\nSee, just like the boundaries of the realms are weakest at [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/), the fabric of reality twists and stretches over *time* too, not just space. So there are certain areas that are more prone to producing gaps that allow travel (take Iceland—there’s a reason they have so many superstitions and stories there), as well as certain times of year.\n\nAnd yep, you guessed it! Late December is one of them. Not only are the gaps wider and more plentiful, but something about the balance of the worlds shifts, just a little. Enough that some entities—the powerful ones—can spend more than a few minutes in the human dimension. For about two weeks, some of those creatures can visit humans for a few hours at a time. Maybe even a whole night.\n\nLends itself to a lot of holiday-time myths and monsters, don’t you think?\n\nNo, this doesn’t mean that Santa exists. If he does, maybe he’s just a normal human with some supernatural blood, or maybe he’s a huge fan of wherever the North Pole *actually* is and only leaves one night a year. All I know is, we’ve never seen him around the bar, and we probably would’ve by now if he was real. Trust me, I asked Henri if Santa would come to Griffin’s Edge every year when I was a kid.\n\nWe do get a few exclusive December guests, though. Samantha, for instance; a shapeshifting ice witch who turned into a giant cat *one time* and chased after a few humans in Iceland on a dare. Not her fault they happened to have been the only ones in their family not to receive grandma’s knitted sweaters for Christmas. Just a coincidence, she insists, an unfortunate misunderstanding. But by God, she’s never lived that one down. And considering the persistence of the Yule Cat story, I’m not sure she will.\n\nShe hibernates most of the year in glaciers—ice witches, as the name implies, take their power from ice—and spends a few nights a week of her waking wintertime with us. She likes mint juleps, and as long as you don’t bring up the whole cat dare, she’s pretty chill.\n\nPun intended. My bad. Couldn’t help it.\n\nAs for Eira and Pax, I first remember them visiting the bar when I was about ten. They were probably here before, but I was lucky enough not to have a run-in with them. Now, every year since, I dread the possibility of seeing them walk through the door. \n\nAnd more often than not, they do.\n\nThe first year was the worst. I’d never seen anyone like them before, but I’m used to that. I’ve learned that it’s never a good idea to stare; neither humans nor nor-humans like to be gawked at. And staring at the *wrong* being can get you killed if it’s taken as a sign of disrespect. Early on, I figured out that it was better to act natural while serving and ask questions to Henri later.\n\nEira and Pax weren’t even unnatural, just…odd. And I don’t say that lightly. Twins, probably, or at least brother and sister, due to their similarities: sharp cheekbones, eyes dark and lifeless as lumps of coal, short curly hair. Both wore massive fur coats, black like their eyes, made of some kind of coarse fur that did *not* look particularly cozy. And wrapped around the arms of those coats, trailing behind them with a soundtrack of metallic rattling, were chains. \n\nI tried not to look at the thick links of chain as I brought out their menus and said their server, Dessa, would be with them in a moment. At the time, Dessa was a young selkie who worked at the bar. Selkies live a long time, but physically she looked about sixteen, and at ten years old, I had a huge crush on her. Kind of like how I imagine some kids have massive crushes on their babysitters.\n\nGod, that’s embarrassing to admit to a bunch of strangers.\n\nAnyway, I passed her by the bathroom door and pointed out her new guests. She glanced at them and wrinkled her nose. “They look…interesting.”\n\n“They seem okay,” I said earnestly, because so far, they hadn’t said a single word to me. “But those chains…” I shuddered. “Be careful.”\n\nShe tousled my hair and winked at me. “I got this, kid.” *Kid?* My heart sunk to my toes as she walked away.\n\nI’m ashamed to say that I avoided her for the rest of the evening because I was mortified by the hair tousle and clear implication that she considered me way too young for her. (To be fair, I was. Especially considering that she was probably like, two hundred, and I was *ten.* But back then, I was horrified that she saw me like a little brother rather than a potential love interest).\n\nI noticed that they were pretty quiet overall; the chains clanking as they ate and drank was louder than their voices. That’s all I really noticed though, because I had plenty of other patrons to handle. It *was* the holidays, after all, and we get a lot of family reunions at the bar that time of year. I was swept up in the hustle and bustle of elves passing gifts to their human children, druids adorned in holly and mistletoe cuddling up with boyfriends beneath it, and a rowdy half-human, half-dwarf family that took up most of the bar and *way* overstayed their welcome.\n\nThe next time I took notice of the chained siblings in the corner was when they were about to leave. Dessa went to collect their payment, they started to rise to their feet, chains clinking—\n\nAnd suddenly Dessa was shouting obscenities at the pair. To be honest, some of it was in a unique variant of Scottish that selkies use, and that all sounded like barks and growls to me. But the parts in English that I understood—oh, boy, those were scathing. She was screaming about them stiffing the check, leaving only tiny coal pebbles when they knew *full well* that we required some kind of monetary payment, and that while many forms of currency were acceptable, *coal* was not one of them. She couldn’t *believe* they were disrespecting the hospitality of Griffin’s Edge that way, she told them heatedly, especially when they’d stayed for over two hours, having nine drinks between them, and raked up a triple-digit bill.\n\nThere was a lot of cursing in there, too, but I won’t repeat that. Selkies often have real bad tempers, and they can get pretty creative with their swears. I’ll let you use your imagination.\n\nThrough it all, the siblings stood there and watched her with stony silence. When she was finally done, her face red and sweaty, the brother reached deep into his coat—almost impossibly deep—and pulled out a few silver coins. I watched as he made eye contact with Dessa, reached out his hand—and then dropped the fistful of coins onto the floor.\n\nShe dutifully dropped to her knees and began picking up the coins, though not without resuming a string of Scottish curse words. The siblings merely gave her one last icy stare and calmly walked out of the bar side-by-side, chains rattling, while she continued to gather coins.\n\nDespite her temper, Dessa mercifully didn’t chase them. She brought her handful of coins behind the bar, and I wordlessly opened the cash register for her to deposit them inside. “Assholes,” she muttered. I nodded but didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to make any assumptions; for all I knew, they *didn’t* know our payment system. I’d never seen them here before. And like I said, Henri always taught me to air on the side of caution and respect when dealing with inhuman beings at the bar. I would’ve started off with less swearing and yelling.\n\nBut, like many selkies, Dessa was a hothead. It was her nature. So I didn’t want to disrespect her either by disagreeing. \n\nWe didn’t mention it for the last few hours of work, and Dessa quietly fumed, mixing drinks a *little* more vigorously than necessary. When it was finally closing time, Dessa offered to clean up for the night—something she almost never did, but tonight insisted would help her calm down—and I gratefully accepted. After all, it had been a busy day, and I still had homeschooling with Henri in the morning.\n\nNothing is ever that simple, though. I drifted into an uneasy sleep, dreaming of coarse-haired coats and endless chains, of lumps of coal in dead faces. \n\nAnd less than two hours later, I jerked awake. The clock by my bed displayed 4:13 AM—u­nlucky numbers in several cultures. I wasn’t sure why I’d woken so suddenly, but I was *freezing.* Like, I could see my breath. \n\nThen I heard it: the noise that must have disrupted my sleep. Chains rattling, accompanied by deep, guttural growls and panicked seal barking. Immediately, my blood turned to ice. This couldn’t be good.\n\nTo this day, I don’t know why I didn’t go get Henri, who was sleeping in the bedroom beside mine. Maybe because I heard the seal barks and thought I could be Dessa’s savior, and if I was, surely she’d finally see me as a suitor and not a little brother. \n\nWhatever it was, I crept out of bed and down the hallway. I tiptoed halfway down the stairs and crouched there, leaning over to see what was happening in the bar without being noticed—I hoped.\n\nI nearly vomited; I had to cover my mouth and nose to prevent audibly gagging. In the corner, where Dessa had knelt to pick up coins, two towering creatures were now torturing her. They were tall, covered in coarse black hair, standing upright on massive cloven hooves. Their hands were sharp-clawed; horns—like those of a goat—emerged from their scalps. And chains, *just like those of the siblings from earlier,* were wrapped around their bodies.\n\nOne was holding Dessa still, her arms pinned behind her back. Clearly, she had already been being tortured; tears streamed down her bloody face. I watched as the other goat creature whipped her across the chest with what appeared to be a bundle of branches; her shirt tore, and blood blossomed from the wound.\n\nAnother whip, this time to her face. Dessa barked as blood sprayed onto the floor. My heart seized. Could I creep up the stairs quietly enough to get Henri? \n\nI tried to turn—and the stair creaked. I froze. \n\nTime seemed to stop as one of the goat-creatures looked back and saw me. It grinned wickedly, revealing pointed fangs, and said something in a language I’d never heard before. I don’t think Dessa even knew I was there; her eyes were swollen shut from the branches. \n\nApparently, the words were some kind of cue, because before I could do anything, the other creature pulled out a long, silver rod designed to look like a tree branch from *somewhere,* and in a motion so fast I barely registered it, ran Dessa straight through.\n\nI squeaked in horror. Her head lolled, and I watched as her slumping body turned into that of a seal’s. The creatures dropped her to the floor, and the one that had been holding her leaned over and placed dark lumps over her eyes—*coal.* \n\nI was still frozen. They were coming for me next. They had to be. Would running to Henri save me or only anger them more? I could only pray that if I did nothing, they might spare me.\n\nBut they didn’t make any move towards the stairs. Instead, black smoke began to swirl around them, covering most of the bar. I coughed and covered my watering eyes with my sleeve.\n\nSeconds later, I felt a hand on my arm. “Come and sit with us, child.” A female voice. I opened my eyes to see the sister from earlier. I think I’d known it was them, but somehow the confirmation still chilled me to the bone. I also knew that her invitation was not optional.\n\nI nodded and let her lead me to the same corner booth they’d occupied earlier that night. Her brother was already sitting there, waiting for us, and Dessa’s body had vanished. I felt sick thinking of what had happened to her and what they might have done with her remains.\n\nI slid into the booth, and the sister followed, blocking me in. They both stared at me with their soulless, coal-like eyes, as if expecting me to speak. \n\nI knew I should be respectful, but I was still freezing—my breath continued to come in visible puffs—and terrified. So I couldn’t help it when I glanced at the edge of the silver branch sticking from the brother’s coat and whispered, “Are you going to kill me too?” My voice shook, though whether from the cold or the fear, I don’t know.\n\nThe sister laughed and stroked my cheek with a long, icy finger. “No, child. You’ve been good, haven’t you? She’d been naughty.”\n\nI was beginning to put everything together. The chains, the branches, their goat-like forms. “Are you…Krampus?”\n\nThe brother snorted, and his sister made a dismissive scoffing noise. Oh God, I hoped I hadn’t offended them. “I am Pax, and this is Eira. Krampus isn’t real.” I could’ve sworn his dull eyes twinkled. “Although even fake stories have roots in reality.”\n\n“What Pax is trying to say,” purred Eira, stroking my cheek again, “is that Krampus is a derivative human tale, an over-simplification that their minds can understand. But its basis lies in us.”\n\n“So you punished Dessa because she’d been bad?” My words were barely a whisper.\n\n“Oh yes,” said Pax. “All that screaming and cursing. Very bad, indeed.” He shook his head. “Good thing you are a much more well-behaved child.”\n\nI nodded wordlessly, shivering as Eira laid her hand over mine. “There *is* one more thing you need to do.”\n\nMy heart nearly stopped. “What?”\n\nShe turned my head to face her, and a chill ran down my spine as I stared into her lifeless eyes. “Do not tell anyone what you saw tonight.”\n\n“That was business between us and her. It would be very naughty of you to share what happened to your friend,” purred Pax. “And you know what we’ll have to do to you if you’re naughty.” His hand stroked the edge of the silver branch, jutting from beneath his coat.\n\nI swallowed hard. \n\n“That includes your uncle, of course,” added Eira. “His bar is just as clean as before. As far as he knows, this never happened.”\n\nI didn’t want to agree, but I heard the threat in their voices. This was not optional. If I said no, they’d kill me right here. So I nodded. “I won’t tell him. I won’t tell anyone.”\n\nEira stroked my hair. “That’s a good boy.”\n\nThey both got up from the booth, chains rattling. I stayed frozen as they strolled towards the door. Just before they reached it, Pax turned back to me. “Remember your promise. We can always come back for you. But we’d hate for that to happen.”\n\nEira smiled sweetly. “Of course we would. Keep being a good boy, Ian.” \n\nAnd then they left, the cold exiting with them; immediately, the room warmed up a solid twenty degrees, and my breath vanished. I stared at the spot on the floor where Dessa had slumped. There was no sign of her. Even the blood, sprayed across the floorboards, was gone.\n\nI didn’t even realize until I was lying in bed later that night, completely awake and staring at the ceiling, that they’d known my name. I’d never told them. Somehow, that only made their threats seem more real.\n\nUncle Henri asked me what was wrong the next morning, of course. I hadn’t slept for the rest of the night, so it was obvious I was exhausted. Not to mention emotionally traumatized. I immediately dissolved into tears and kept insisting that I couldn’t tell him.\n\nWhen Dessa didn’t show up to work that afternoon, I felt Henri’s piercing gaze on me. I said nothing, but he’s the wisest person I know. I could see him piecing things together.\n\nI still have no idea how much he figured out. If I had to guess, probably most of it. I *do* know that every year they’ve come to the bar since, he won’t let any of the usual bar staff serve them, especially me. Henri himself stops whatever managerial business he’s up to and takes care of their orders. He is exceptionally polite, but when he smiles at them, the smiles don’t reach his eyes.\n\nI think he knows he can’t ban them for breaking the rules of Griffin’s Edge, because then they’ll think I told him. And even now, eight years later, I have no doubt they’d fulfill their promise. I see the way they watch me every time they visit. I feel their creepy coal eyes on me.\n\nSo instead, Henri simply makes sure no one else has the opportunity to disrespect them. He protects the bar staff and patrons in the safest way possible. \n\nI still feel sick every time the temperature drops twenty degrees as they walk in, chains clinking. They haven’t been back *every* year since, but they come most years. And I dread it every December. \n\nThey visited us this year, a few days before Christmas. I hated every second. Henri hurried over and served them kindly, but it was me they watched for hours. My skin crawled as I mixed drinks and tried to avoid looking in the direction of their corner at all. I barely breathed for three hours.\n\nBecause all I could think was, with the murders going around and my increased jumping and all the weirdness of the past few months, what if they decide I’ve been naughty?",

        "text": "The plan was to spend the holidays alone, in peace, catching up on the year behind and preparing for the one ahead. I guess I got what I wanted in a way I never could have predicted.\n\nIt was just after eleven at night in the dawn of 1986. I was alone in my cottage rental that sat snuggled into a picture perfect village, just outside of the city where I attended university in the UK. My flatmates had gone home to their respective families, but I chose not to make the flight across the pond to the United States, from which I hailed. I had decided to attend university in a foreign country to escape the midwestern bubble I was raised in, and I wanted to experience it for all it was worth. At just nineteen, I was naive and mousy, but a fresh start was doing me a world of good.\n\nNever one for partying, I had holed up in the cottage, determined to finish sewing the flannel nightgown I had started back in October. But I had long tired of it and, after spending Christmas alone, found that I didn’t want to do the same for New Years. Maybe a stiff drink and a few strangers to sing Auld Lang Syne with would scratch that itch. \n\nPutting on my heavy, knee length jacket, gloves and a hat, I locked up the apartment tight and stepped outside and into the cold. The village’s population was small, serving mostly as a place for university students who couldn’t afford lodging in the city proper to live. I didn’t expect to see a lot of people out tonight, as most students had made like my flatmates and skipped town, but I did look forward to the company of the ones I encountered.\n\nThe village was set up in a way as to separate the cottages from the high street. To get from the quaint, garden lined neighborhood and to the pubs, I would have to follow a cobblestone path out my front door and around the charming pond in the heart of the park, which served as the centerpiece for the village. Once on the other side of the pond, a treelined incline would direct you onto the high street. I’d always loved the walk, and it was especially magical with the moonlight twinkling off of the fresh fallen slow. \n\nThe journey was ever festive, with rows of colored lights strung to the wooden fence lining the cobblestone path. When I reached the pond, the strings of lights doubled. Lighted ornament shaped fixtures adorned the illuminated lamp posts surrounding it, while white string lights added some extra sparkle to the posts themselves. \n\nThe perfect combination of the lights, the moon, and the fresh white canvas of snow lit up the pond like a Christmas tree. The thick layer of crystal clear ice from the unprecedented cold we’d been having was perfect for ice skating, and I was sure tomorrow would bring plenty of people eager to ring in the New Year with such an activity. \n\nFor tonight, it was desolate, leaving me in solitude to enjoy the pristine, untouched way it glistened in the moonlight, a dusting of snow just beginning to accumulate on top of it. I could have delighted in the peacefulness of this moment and this place for ages, but the cold was nipping at my nose, and I needed to find shelter and companionship soon. \n\nWith a few last glances, I moved along and was soon in the village, preparing to take up solace in the closest pub. It was a small affair, known for its whiskey and merriment. It seemed just right for the occasion. As expected, only a few locals were milling about outside, but inside, through the Victorian pub windows, I could see a lively crowd having themselves a joyous night. It was exactly the kind of place I was looking to inhabit.\n\nNodding to the couple quietly talking amongst themselves in either a fight or an intense conversation - I couldn’t tell which - outside of the pub, I opened the door, prepared to be greeted by the sounds of loud music and cheer that were wafting onto the streets. \n\nInstead, I was met with silence. But that wasn’t the only disturbing thing setting off alarm bells in my head. The place was dark, empty, so much so that it looked like someone had closed it down hours ago and left me wondering why they left the door unlocked.\n\nConfused, I closed the door and backed away from the pub, wanting to take a second look around at what I’d initially observed. I wasn’t tired, I had nothing but water and coffee to drink today, and I wasn’t medicated, so there had to be a simple explanation. When I saw the place in a panoramic view, things only became more peculiar. \n\nThat couple I had just nodded to? Gone. All the people and lights and sounds from inside the pub? Vanished. The beautiful holiday lights that had lit my path to the village? It’s like they’d never existed at all. In fact, there wasn’t a soul or sound in sight. Just silence and the dark.\n\nNot wanting to admit to myself how frightened I was and determined to find an answer, logic telling me that people don’t just disappear into thin air and alternate dimensions are not a thing you enter down a rabbit hole and into, I trudged on. After all, maybe everyone had simply made haste to another part of the village. To the right of the pub was nothing but fields, but to the left was a sharp curve that led into the more populated part of the high street. That’s where I’d find everyone, I was sure. \n\nOnward I went, breathing a sigh of relief when I cleared the corner and found the streets bustling, at least in comparison to the size of the village, with a few stragglers looking to get into the warmth of a holiday celebration. I immediately went for the village’s only other pub. It was a little rowdier and usually had a pianist playing songs that annoyed me, but if anyone needed a drink right now, it was me. If sober me was imagining people appearing and then disappearing, drunk me had to be significantly more adept to handle life. \n\nBefore I had a chance to hastily twist the doorknob, my heart leapt into my throat, my stomach to the floor. The very same couple who I’d seen at the previous pub were standing outside of this one. Their hushed tones and blank expressions were the same. I nodded to them again - if only for posterity’s sake, in case we met again - only to be ignored like I had been the first time. I hoped this was where history would stop repeating itself. \n\nSurely the same outcome wouldn’t occur twice, but it did. The noise, the sights, the sounds - they all disappeared when I opened the door to the pub. This time, instead of backing away, I shut the door and turned to face the street. The bare, vacant, dark streets. No lights, no couple, no bustling, no stragglers, not even footprints in the snow to prove they’d been there. That was, except for one set; my own. I recognized the unusual zig zag pattern from the sole of my boots. How could this be?\n\nMy first inclination was to call out, hoping someone would answer back. No one did. I could see almost every shop and business on the high street from my vantage point, and they all sat dark and lifeless. I was at a loss. The only thing not in my view was the pub where this journey of oddities had originated, so I retraced my steps. It, too, was just as I had left it. \n\nThe only thing I could think to do was go back to the cottage, but there was something inherently terrifying about returning to my cottage knowing that, somehow, I appeared to be the only sign of life from this village to the city limits. If this was a setup, I wasn’t sure for what. And what if I did get home, only to find that the lights I left on there had been extinguished, too? Did I dare go in? There was no one to run to for help, and that was the scariest thing of all. I was more alone than I had ever imagined possible. \n\nOne last stroll through the high street couldn’t hurt. A few knocks on some doors for proof of life and to put my mind at ease was all I needed. If one person graced me with their presence, it would quell my growing fear. On New Year’s Eve, the chances of waking someone at this hour were lower than average, so I was set in my decision to find another human, any human, and see if they, too, shared in my delusion. \n\nI went around from business to business, pounding hard on all of their doors. I hoped to startle a wayward employee still stuck closing up shop in the back, where the lights couldn’t be seen through the windows to the outside world. I’d even settle an owner who lived above their business and was just trying to enjoy their night with their curtains good and drawn. That would explain why I saw no lights. That’s what I chose to tell myself in order to justify my resolution. \n\nBy the third door, a sinking realization came over me. By the fifth, I felt like I was going to be sick. No matter how hard I knocked or yelled, no one answered. The village remained absent of movement and any guiding light. At the sixth through the tenth doors, I tried calling out for help, using all my built up terror to display the behaviors of a person in dire need of assistance, but no one came to my aid. \n\nExhausted from the emotional toll of failed efforts, I knew I should give up the ghost of this mission, because even the ghosts were hiding from me. I couldn’t decide if it was more risky to stay here, where I knew something was wrong, or make my way to the cottage and into the unknown. I slunk back against the door to the bakery, my body automatically sliding down it and not stopping until I was sitting in the snow. \n\nI just needed a minute to reflect on what I had been through and come up with a game plan. It was so quiet that you could hear the snow falling. I didn’t know that was possible until tonight, but it had a distinctive sound, like the tiny tinkling of a fairy in flight as it hit the ground. It only seemed to get louder as my heart pounded faster and more fervently. \n\nStaying anywhere in this village alone, whether it be here or at the cottage, seemed like a poor choice to make, but escaping to the city was going to be no easy feat. With the high street so close to the cottage, and transportation to and from the city better than expected due to our proximity to the university, my flatmates and I had no reason to waste money on vehicles of our own. The university’s night class schedule kept buses running late into the night at any other time of the year. But we were on holiday. The bus was on a pared down schedule, and trying to summon a taxi on New Year’s Eve was bound to fail as successfully as finding another person had.\n\nMy belief that I would truly be safe here while my flatmates were gone had come back around to bite me. If all else went wrong with the world, I was sure that everything I needed could be found within the village. Everything, it would now seem, except for another human being and some answers.\n\nWas the whole world like this now? Did warfare find us, and in some twist of fate I had managed to be the last lone survivor, high and hallucinating on some biochemical that was dispersed into the air? Was any of this real? Could it be?\n\nIf this wasn’t real, nothing was stopping me from trying to open all the doors and literally looking for answers. So I did just that, finding that each door opened effortlessly, no locks in place to hold them shut. Every dwelling I entered was exactly the same. All the lights were off and, from what I could see once my eyes adjusted to the blackness, things were strewn about. It was as if everyone stopped what they were doing and ran for cover on cue.\n\nMaybe that was exactly what had happened. In the midst of New Year’s celebrations, an emergency broadcast came across radios and televisions alike, causing everyone to make haste for the cellars beneath the buildings. It was possible, depending on the instructions given and circumstances presented, that they were advised to turn off all the lights first, but unlikely. No one would have tended to the street lights and outdoor decorations, too. \n\nRegardless, I decided to check for myself. My final stop was the pub where it all began. I stumbled around for a light switch, but it was already flipped on. Things just kept getting curiouser and curiouser. Carefully creeping through the maze of tables, as to not fall over something and meet my maker, I was able to maneuver myself behind the bar where a radio sat in the far corner. I wasn’t convinced it was going to work, but to my surprise it sprang to life, probably thanks to the batteries inside of it. \n\nEverything was business as usual. Each station I switched to was deep into their annual New Year’s Eve celebrations. Dumbstruck and desperate, I tried each of the few the village got for good measure. There were no alarm bells, no calls to action or signs of the apocalypse. There was nothing to explain what was happening here, but the situation remained the same. Everyone was gone. Everything was dark.\n\nOut of ideas and avenues to explore, I made my way back to the cottage. All of my senses were on high alert and hesitant, refusing to let their guard down and enjoy the scenery as I had on the walk over. Though the moon was still out and the snow still falling, everything seemed to have a filter over it, making it just a touch darker and more hazy than before. It was where the tree line fell away to reveal the pond that all of that changed. \n\nEverything surrounding the pond was just as before, at least from what the eye could see from my current perspective. All of the Christmas lights were still aglow, the lanterns on the lamp posts still illuminating the pond. It spooked me in the same way that it gave me hope. Maybe whatever I had seen, and shouldn’t have, back in the village didn’t extend past the pond and to the cottages. It was possible that I could go home and find everything right with the world there, and just for tonight, I could accept that. Just until I could make heads or tails out of my trip to Wonderland by reevaluating things in the light of day. \n\nLooks proved to be deceiving because, deep down, something felt off. As I got closer to the pond, the uneasy feeling overwhelmed me and filled with dread, sending a shiver unlike any other I’ve experienced down my spine. It didn’t take me long to find out why. \n\nThe path to home was only feet from the pond, a strip of snow covered grass between them, giving me a front row seat of the horrors within. In complete dissonance to the beauty I’d witnessed on my previous stroll through, the pond was no longer serenely iced over with a dusting of snow. This time, all of the snow was gone. In its place, through the crystal clear ice, I could see faces staring up at me. Their eyes and mouths were wide open, like they were screaming for help, but the sound didn’t resonate. There were so many faces. \n\nIt was as if they were frozen behind glass, horrified in their expression, like time stopped in the worst moment of their lives and someone encapsulated them forevermore. No one looked hurt or injured, just there. No one moved, not so much as to twitch from the cold that was overtaking their systems. No one was sinking to the bottom like the shipwreck they were sure to become from the weight of the water soaking into their fully clothed bodies. \n\nThe closer I looked, the more I discerned that it wasn’t just their faces I was seeing, but their splayed out bodies pressed firmly up against the ice. All of them were lined up one against the other, perfectly fitted like a jigsaw puzzle. Their hands were palms up against the ice, which appeared so clear that I could see the lines in their palms. There were far too many people here to only be villagers. Some of the faces I recognized, but most I didn’t.\n\nI couldn’t fathom how they got in there. I could see end to end of the small pond, and there were no cracks or holes in the ice, no weak spots to account for people being dragged beneath its surface. What’s more is that I was sure I had been in the village no longer than an hour, and even that was being generous. The bodies were not here before. I had remembered stopping to fondly admire the pond during my first walk-through, the cold weather the only thing that hustled me along. Even a large group of individuals wouldn’t have had the time to pull something this elaborate off.\n\nOn a whim, I stood at the edge of the pond and bent down. Taking off my glove, I put my bare hand to the ice to confirm that this wasn’t some elaborate prank. It was so cold out that my hand almost became one with the ice, a confirmation that this was what it appeared to be. Startled, I pulled away quickly, falling backwards toward the path, frozen in fear. \n\nI don’t know how long I stared into the lifeless abyss, trying to make sense of something that was so senseless. At some point, my brain caught up to my shell-shocked reaction. It told me to move, to excommunicate myself from this village and this place, and to not waste any time doing so. It was indescribably stupid the way I stayed staring at the bodies beneath the ice like they were an art installation, as opposed to someone’s loved ones and friends. They were people who had already taken their last breaths. \n\nThis was happening. This was real. That question no longer lingered around unanswered.\n\nOnce that cognizance hit and settled, I took off like a shot away from the pond, and I didn’t slow down until I got back to the cottage. It was still alight, like I’d left it, and I wasted no time locking the doors and scrambling for the phone book in search of numbers for the city’s taxi services. It took me several tries to find a free one on a night when drinking took celebratory precedence. I’d have a bit of a wait until they reached me, so I spent that time haphazardly throwing everything I owned into a suitcase, relieved that I had traveled light and lived happily with little worldly possessions. \n\nI watched the time on my alarm clock like a hawk, unwilling to be even a second late to catch my cab upon its arrival. With everything in tow, I scrambled out of the house with minutes to spare. I left no note, no trace of ever being there at all except for the keys I left behind in the postbox. Leaving didn’t feel like the right thing to do, but it’s the only thing that was left for me to do. \n\nCalling the city police on this specific night, where alcohol flowed freely and abundantly, and regaling them with my curious tale would only bring about the paddy wagon, and I would end up the only sober person in the drunk tank. That was a far worse fate than the karma I would suffer for leaving this horror show behind for someone else to discover. I wasn’t waiting around until morning, anticipating whether I would become just another body in that pond. So I left to go back home to The States and never looked back. \n\nIt’s been thirty-seven years to the day, and though I believed I would one day know the truth about what happened to me that night, the answers never materialized. In fact, trying to find them has led me down some dark paths and twisted alleyways that my mind will never fully escape. Maybe it was that news stations weren’t as global as they are today, and Google wasn’t something we could have imagined to be possible in our wildest dreams. Things that happened in small towns and villages stayed in those small towns and villages back in those days, especially when they happened on a different continent. \n\nI’ve told a lot of lies over the years, and became a person that I’m not always proud of. When people asked why I came back so quickly and without notice, I told them that I couldn’t hack it and left it at that. I wasted money and resources to escape that night, but I don’t regret it. I only regret that I left the way I did, without sticking around the nearby city until pieces to the puzzle fit together and gave me the answers I have accepted I will forever crave. I was young and fearful, and that bred a knee-jerk reaction that I’ve always wished I could take back. \n\nBut the worst part, the thing that keeps me up at night, is wondering what ever became of my flatmates when they arrived back from their holidays. I tried to reach to them dozens of times in the week after they were to return. I made the expensive long distant calls, but I never had to pay, because no one ever answered. I wrote the letters and paid the postage to have them sent. I never heard back, nor did the letters find their way back to me, undeliverable. \n\nWe were thick as thieves in the time we spent together, figuring out a new country like it was our own lawless land. Surely they would wonder why I up and left so suddenly. Or was it that they found out what happened to the village and assumed I was a body in that pond that went unidentified in all of the hoopla? Could they have never been allowed to return to our cottage to receive any of my letters? \n\nI scoured Facebook time and time again trying to find them, but it’s a near impossible feat. They could be anywhere in the world by now. They could have gotten married and changed their names. But they also could have met a far worse fate than I like to think about. Because sometimes, when I finally fall asleep at night, I go back to that pond and that night. And amongst the faces, I see theirs now, too, and I don’t feel safe.",

        "text": "\tThe plan was to spend the holidays alone, in peace, catching up on the year behind and preparing for the one ahead. I guess I got what I wanted in a way I never could have predicted.\n\n\tIt was just after eleven at night in the dawn of 1986. I was alone in my cottage rental that sat snuggled into a picture perfect village, just outside of the city where I attended university in the UK. My flatmates had gone home to their respective families, but I chose not to make the flight across the pond to the United States, from which I hailed. I had decided to attend university in a foreign country to escape the midwestern bubble I was raised in, and I wanted to experience it for all it was worth. At just nineteen, I was naive and mousy, but a fresh start was doing me a world of good.\n\n\tNever one for partying, I had holed up in the cottage, determined to finish sewing the flannel nightgown I had started back in October. But I had long tired of it and, after spending Christmas alone, found that I didn’t want to do the same for New Years. Maybe a stiff drink and a few strangers to sing Auld Lang Syne with would scratch that itch. \n\n\tPutting on my heavy, knee length jacket, gloves and a hat, I locked up the apartment tight and stepped outside and into the cold. The village’s population was small, serving mostly as a place for university students who couldn’t afford lodging in the city proper to live. I didn’t expect to see a lot of people out tonight, as most students had made like my flatmates and skipped town, but I did look forward to the company of the ones I encountered.\n\n\tThe village was set up in a way as to separate the cottages from the high street. To get from the quaint, garden lined neighborhood and to the pubs, I would have to follow a cobblestone path out my front door and around the charming pond in the heart of the park, which served as the centerpiece for the village. Once on the other side of the pond, a treelined incline would direct you onto the high street. I’d always loved the walk, and it was especially magical with the moonlight twinkling off of the fresh fallen slow. \n\n\tThe journey was ever festive, with rows of colored lights strung to the wooden fence lining the cobblestone path. When I reached the pond, the strings of lights doubled. Lighted ornament shaped fixtures adorned the illuminated lamp posts surrounding it, while white string lights added some extra sparkle to the posts themselves. \n\n\tThe perfect combination of the lights, the moon, and the fresh white canvas of snow lit up the pond like a Christmas tree. The thick layer of crystal clear ice from the unprecedented cold we’d been having was perfect for ice skating, and I was sure tomorrow would bring plenty of people eager to ring in the New Year with such an activity. \n\n\tFor tonight, it was desolate, leaving me in solitude to enjoy the pristine, untouched way it glistened in the moonlight, a dusting of snow just beginning to accumulate on top of it.

There were so many faces. \n\n\tIt was as if they were frozen behind glass, horrified in their expression, like time stopped in the worst moment of their lives and someone encapsulated them forevermore. No one looked hurt or injured, just there. No one moved, not so much as to twitch from the cold that was overtaking their systems. No one was sinking to the bottom like the shipwreck they were sure to become from the weight of the water soaking into their fully clothed bodies. \n\n\tThe closer I looked, the more I discerned that it wasn’t just their faces I was seeing, but their splayed out bodies pressed firmly up against the ice. All of them were lined up one against the other, perfectly fitted like a jigsaw puzzle. Their hands were palms up against the ice, which appeared so clear that I could see the lines in their palms. There were far too many people here to only be villagers. Some of the faces I recognized, but most I didn’t.\n\n\tI couldn’t fathom how they got in there. I could see end to end of the small pond, and there were no cracks or holes in the ice, no weak spots to account for people being dragged beneath its surface. What’s more is that I was sure I had been in the village no longer than an hour, and even that was being generous. The bodies were not here before. I had remembered stopping to fondly admire the pond during my first walk-through, the cold weather the only thing that hustled me along. Even a large group of individuals wouldn’t have had the time to pull something this elaborate off.\n\n\tOn a whim, I stood at the edge of the pond and bent down. Taking off my glove, I put my bare hand to the ice to confirm that this wasn’t some elaborate prank. It was so cold out that my hand almost became one with the ice, a confirmation that this was what it appeared to be. Startled, I pulled away quickly, falling backwards toward the path, frozen in fear. \n\n\tI don’t know how long I stared into the lifeless abyss, trying to make sense of something that was so senseless. At some point, my brain caught up to my shell-shocked reaction. It told me to move, to excommunicate myself from this village and this place, and to not waste any time doing so. It was indescribably stupid the way I stayed staring at the bodies beneath the ice like they were an art installation, as opposed to someone’s loved ones and friends. They were people who had already taken their last breaths. \n\n\tThis was happening. This was real. That question no longer lingered around unanswered.\n\t\n\tOnce that cognizance hit and settled, I took off like a shot away from the pond, and I didn’t slow down until I got back to the cottage. It was still alight, like I’d left it, and I wasted no time locking the doors and scrambling for the phone book in search of numbers for the city’s taxi services. It took me several tries to find a free one on a night when drinking took celebratory precedence. I’d have a bit of a wait until they reached me, so I spent that time haphazardly throwing everything I owned into a suitcase, relieved that I had traveled light and lived happily with little worldly possessions. \n\n\tI watched the time on my alarm clock like a hawk, unwilling to be even a second late to catch my cab upon its arrival. With everything in tow, I scrambled out of the house with minutes to spare. I left no note, no trace of ever being there at all except for the keys I left behind in the postbox. Leaving didn’t feel like the right thing to do, but it’s the only thing that was left for me to do. \n\n\tCalling the city police on this specific night, where alcohol flowed freely and abundantly, and regaling them with my curious tale would only bring about the paddy wagon, and I would end up the only sober person in the drunk tank. That was a far worse fate than the karma I would suffer for leaving this horror show behind for someone else to discover. I wasn’t waiting around until morning, anticipating whether I would become just another body in that pond. So I left to go back home to The States and never looked back. \n\n\tIt’s been thirty-seven years to the day, and though I believed I would one day know the truth about what happened to me that night, the answers never materialized. In fact, trying to find them has led me down some dark paths and twisted alleyways that my mind will never fully escape. Maybe it was that news stations weren’t as global as they are today, and Google wasn’t something we could have imagined to be possible in our wildest dreams. Things that happened in small towns and villages stayed in those small towns and villages back in those days, especially when they happened on a different continent. \n\n\tI’ve told a lot of lies over the years, and became a person that I’m not always proud of. When people asked why I came back so quickly and without notice, I told them that I couldn’t hack it and left it at that. I wasted money and resources to escape that night, but I don’t regret it. I only regret that I left the way I did, without sticking around the nearby city until pieces to the puzzle fit together and gave me the answers I have accepted I will forever crave. I was young and fearful, and that bred a knee-jerk reaction that I’ve always wished I could take back. \n\n\tBut the worst part, the thing that keeps me up at night, is wondering what ever became of my flatmates when they arrived back from their holidays. I tried to reach to them dozens of times in the week after they were to return. I made the expensive long distant calls, but I never had to pay, because no one ever answered. I wrote the letters and paid the postage to have them sent. I never heard back, nor did the letters find their way back to me, undeliverable. \n\n\tWe were thick as thieves in the time we spent together, figuring out a new country like it was our own lawless land. Surely they would wonder why I up and left so suddenly. Or was it that they found out what happened to the village and assumed I was a body in that pond that went unidentified in all of the hoopla? Could they have never been allowed to return to our cottage to receive any of my letters? \n\n\tI scoured Facebook time and time again trying to find them, but it’s a near impossible feat. They could be anywhere in the world by now. They could have gotten married and changed their names. But they also could have met a far worse fate than I like to think about. Because sometimes, when I finally fall asleep at night, I go back to that pond and that night. And amongst the faces, I see theirs now, too, and I don’t feel safe.",

        "text": "I rang the doorbell with a nudge of my elbow, careful not to tip the container of homemade stew too much for fear of spilling it, rendering my journey relatively useless. \n\nI was there to deliver some homemade food, and play nurse to all three of my sick friends, whose house had apparently been torn through by some unnamed sickness - taking care of some of the chores that had fallen by the wayside; feeding the cat, tidying up a bit.\n\nIt had been a week since the first of the three got sick. It was the ever punctual Chelsea, missing a day of school for the first time I could recall since she had Mono in high school. \n\n\"I just feel like shit,\" she explained when I called her that first day, after she’d missed class. \n\n“My head hurts, my muscles keep spasming, I'm dizzy.\"\n\nShe sighed for a moment, before adding,\" Fuck, my hairs been falling out in clumps. And it…it's growing back but it's…it's different. I dunno what I'm saying.\" \n\n\"You think it's Covid?\" I asked, unsure quite how to respond.\n\nShe was the med student after all, studying veterinary medicine, in an exclusive program, operating at the top of her class so well that she’d been working some government internship she’d been reluctant to speak about. \n\nI studied early education, besides suggesting a doctor, a thought I’m sure she’d had on her own, I wasn't sure what else I could say. \n\n\"Dunno, I'd guess so. Whatever it is, I need to shake it before finals week.\" \n\nThat had been almost two weeks ago. Yet finals week came, and went, and her condition only worsened gradually. Kyla and Tracy followed soon after, and before long it had been days since I’d last seen or spoken to them in person, and almost a week since I’d heard from Chelsea at all.\n\nI wiggled my nose trying to ensure my mask was on, as the chime of the bell echoed from behind the double doors, running over my mental list. \n\nDrop off food, make sure the cat is fed, hang for a bit and leave before getting yourself sick too. It was a simple enough itinerary. \n\nThrough the stained glass, I could see someone approaching from within, small and huddled beneath what looked to be a thick blanket.\n\nAfter a few moments, Kyla opened the door, and I struggled to stifle my reaction as I took in my best friend's appearance, changing so drastically over a week.\n\nShe looked utterly pallid, her brown skin appearing unusually pale and paper thin, covered in a glistening sheen of sweat in which strands of thin hair stuck. I could see small flecks lining her skin, like blackheads though they weren’t raised, almost as though someone had scattered tiny seeds across her face. Her hair, what of it I could make out from beneath the blanket she wrapped around her like a shawl was coarse and short, and patchy in some places, almost to the scalp. \n\nIt was a stark contrast to how I’d even seen her last, skin glowing and hair in healthy twin braids hanging past her shoulders. I did my best not to relay my shock.\n\n“Hey girl,” I said, injecting perhaps a bit too much artificial cheer into my voice.\n\nLifting the tupperware I said, “I brought my famous chicken soup.”\n\n“Come in.” She said with a thin smile, before shuddering, her body rocked by a sudden spasm that made her wince.\n\nHer hand rose to her face, running along her skin gingerly as she winced. \n\nHer smile returned in an instant, but her eyes gleamed for a moment with pain and…*panic*? Unease? There was something in there for a moment, gone as soon as it appeared. \n\nI frowned beneath my mask, as I stepped inside, feeling both worried for my friend, and hoping beyond hope my N95 would work for whatever this was, assuming it wasn’t just Covid.\n\nA part of me wanted to turn back and leave, to place the food on the entryway table, and say my goodbyes but a greater part of me had missed my friends, and didn’t intend to look like an ass in their collective moment of need.\n\nWhether I wanted to admit it to myself or not, Chelsea’s complete radio silence unnerved me. It wasn’t like her to not even text, and it had been days since she’d given even that courtesy. I had to worry about just how sick she might be.\n\nAnd besides, I’d only offered to come help with a few things they’d been too exhausted to do in their condition. I could be in and out in an hour or two, and shower vigorously once I returned to my apartment.\n\nI stepped inside past Kyla, kicking my boots off in the loft. The first thing to catch my attention was the temperature, a bone-chilling cool, somehow worse than that outside. \n\nQuickly, I determined the jacket would be staying on.\n\n“Is your heat broken?” I asked her, unable to keep the shock from my voice.\n\nShe shook her head with a humorless laugh, scratching her head roughly for a moment.\n\n“No, we…like it like this. It gets…really hot.” She said, her eyes meeting mine. I stifled a shiver, an odd chill creeping up my back as she did so. There was something in her gaze, an…empty sort of intensity is the only way I can think to explain it, that was very much unlike her. It made me uneasy, in a way I couldn’t quite understand. \n\nI worried for a moment, just how sick my friends might be.\n\nI nodded, unsure what to say, and continued forward into the house.\n\nAs she stepped forward to move in beside me, another sudden shudder seemed to rip through her, making her muscles tense visibly and body jerk violently.\n\n“I’m okay,” she breathed, before I could speak, “Let’s take this to the kitchen.”\n\nI nodded, stepping into the living room from which I could hear the T.V. blaring.\n\nThe room was quite a mess, empty and half-empty glasses and mugs littering the place, all filled with water to some extent, plates with unfinished meals, some of which were at least days old sat along any open space on the coffee table or lamp stands.\n\nThe air smelled stale, the aromas of faint sweat and sickness filling the room, as dust motes drift lazily through the air illuminated only by the glare of the television. \n\nI nearly jumped when I saw someone stir on the couch. \n\n“Tracy?” This time I could hardly contain my surprise at the sight of her.\n\nAfter a moment Tracy opened her eyes, the lids an unhealthy yellowish tint with the rest of her skin no better off. As she did so, her eyes locked on me for a moment, and in that instance I was taken aback at the sight of a hunger, no, a thirst I had never seen before.\n\nShe shot up, for a moment revealing her bare skin in the t-shirt she wore, as she reached for the half-empty glass of water on the coffee table in front of her, in an instance breathing it down, and I felt my stomach turn. \n\nI stepped away, hardly able to help myself as I saw the skin of her chest, neck and forearms. Small holes seemed to riddle the now exposed skin, almost like massive pores in an effect that would send the worst trypophobe into a panic. \n\nIt was a brief glimpse, but in that moment, I could swear the flesh beneath them…pulsed and moved, as though the very veins beneath were alive.\n\nShe quickly threw the blanket she was using as a makeshift shawl back over her, muttering an apology, her body wracked by a familiar shudder. \n\n“Hey,” she said weekly, smiling weakly at me.\n\n“Is that the famous chicken soup?”\n\nIt took me a moment to respond, my mind still lingering on the sight of her skin, already questioning what I thought I’d seen. The image of her flesh seeming shifting beneath those patches riddled with so many holes…it was beginning to feel more corporeal and unlikely. \n\nI quickly nodded, realizing how my lack of response must have been seen, and determining that it was clear I hadn’t seen correctly. The lights in the living room were off, with only the T.V. and what waning sunlight spilled in through the shuttered blinds to see, and I couldn’t be certain what I had seen at such a brief glimpse, especially to determine it was something so…well, impossible.\n\n“Yeah, I figured you guys probably weren’t feeling all that up to cooking, so,” I lifted the container with a smile.\n\nShe grinned, an expression that died before reaching her eyes - sitting up with visible effort, grunting and grimacing as she did so. \n\nI could see she was gathering herself to stand and greet me, likely with a hug.\n\nMy mind flashed back to those images just moments before. Whether I’d seen wrong or not, my stomach turned at the thought.\n\nIt feels awful even in retrospect, but the truth was I didn’t want them to touch me. Seeing the condition they were all in, the thought of getting…whatever this was was starting to horrify me, to the point that I was beginning to regret ever coming.\n\n“I’m…gonna go put this down,” I said quickly, stepping away before she could make her way to her feet, and turning towards the kitchen. \n\n“Sure,” she spoke, voice notably hoarse. “You thirsty? Need water, anything?”\n\n“I’m good.” I said, shooting back a tight-lipped grin, as I made my way into the kitchen.\n\nKyla trailed a short distance behind, pausing at the table to grab one of the unfinished glasses, and similarly finishing it in an instant.\n\nStepping into the kitchen, I was greeted by a scene hardly better than the rest of the house. Half-empty plates piled in the sink, meals abandoned in the midst of being made lining the counters as a heavy, mildew-y stench hung heavy the farther into the room I came. And similar to the living room, the presence of half-finished glasses of water appeared a staple of the place now.\n\nI searched from some space, seeking out one of the few open surfaces I could find in the room, and making my way forward to set down the stew beside what usually served as the dining table, and now simply held glass after glass of water, and filthy plates.\n\nAs I was setting it down, my hand near a plate atop which a glass, and a myriad of trash had been piled, my skin buzzed with a sudden shock of panic as I felt…something, thin and cold run across the back of my hand. \n\nI yanked it back, in the process, toppling over one of the glasses and spilling water across the table. I shot up, some of the water spilling back into my lap.\n\n“Fuck.” I spat. I was about to search the kitchen for the paper towels, the roll on the table empty save for a sparse few shred of paper, but before I could my eyes fell on the impromptu puddle on the table, searching for whatever it was I’d felt on my hand.\n\nAs I looked, I felt my stomach twist and furl into nauseating knots with snakelike motion, \n\nAt first glance, they’d appeared some odd pattern in the table. I hadn’t looked too closely at first, more focused on the front of my pants now uncomfortably damp, but as I did so I noticed the tiny black lines moving and wriggling spastically through the shallow water.\n\nThey were bugs, worms of some sort, and as I looked I realized there weren't just a few, but dozens, maybe hundreds of the disgusting little things, throughout the room, visible in several of the glasses and mugs of room temperature water, floating and twisting lazily. \n\nI’d hardly noticed on entry, barely glancing in the cups and mugs lining the room, but now peering into each of them, my skin crawled as though the very insects were moving in droves across it, almost each turning up the same.\n\n“Jesus Christ, what the hell are those?” I couldn’t keep the disgust out of my voice, as I looked over the table.\n\nThis was more than just a few bugs, it appeared to be a veritable infestation. Just how sick were they to let things get this bad? I knew Chelsea, she was a clean freak by the most generous of estimates, I couldn’t imagine her being okay with such a situation even on her deathbed.\n\nNo, something was *deeply* wrong here.\n\nKyla moved with the most quickness I’d seen from her since I’d arrived, pulling a series of hand towels from a drawer, and throwing them over the table, muttering nervous apologies.\n\n“I’m sorry, I know it’s disgusting. I don’t know what they are, they showed up last week and the damn things have been everywhere.” I watched, skin crawling and stomach turning as I watched Kyla kneel by the table, peering closely at one of the small creatures dangling off the side.\n\nI almost shuddered as she grasped it between her index finger and thumb, raising it for a moment to observe closer. \n\n“They seem to like water.”\n\n“Jesus Christ, Ky, you’re touching it that’s…” I felt my gut rumble with the distant threat of nausea, mentally cursing my weak stomach as I watched her twist the thing between her fingers. \n\nI had half a mind to slap it from her hand, so taken aback by the behavior so unlike Kyla who until that point had never demonstrated anything less than utter revulsion when grazed by so much as a ladybug.\n\nIn that moment, watching her observe the wriggling creature as it wrapped around her finger, a look of placid interest bordering on something more, I felt as though I didn’t recognize the woman before me.\n\nShe scratched mindlessly beneath her eye for a moment, with such ferociously it left angry red cuts across her skin, thin trickles of blood running from it.\n\nAnother twitch seemed to shock her system.\n\n“Ever since Chelsea got sick, they’ve been here,” she spoke, her eyes not leaving the creature still writhing around her fingers. \n\nHer face contorted for a moment, into something resembling a grimace, as though the muscles weren’t entirely under her control before returning to normal.\n\nStanding in the light of the kitchen, my eyes followed the shape of her bones visible beneath her skin which clung to her like an ill-fitting suit. Her face was gaunt, what looked to be a single errant vein visible beneath stretching from her chin, down her neck and disappearing under her shirt, pulsing in a way that made it seem almost alive. \n\nThe odd effect made my skin crawl, despite myself. \n\nHer eyes were bordered with deep set bags, casting a shadow around them and…\n\n“Kyla…” I breathed, my vision not wavering once from her face, focused on the area beneath her eye. \n\n“Your face…” I felt my hand brush against my own, and after a moment, head cocking to the side as she looked at me with a moment's confusion, she appeared to realize what I was indicating.\n\nI could feel the contents of my stomach shift as her hand touched her face. She scratched absently for a moment, staring at me with a glazed sort of expression that made my heart drop, before pressing her finger against it. There was…*something* beneath her eyelid. \n\nI almost hadn’t registered it at first, appearing almost like an overly-pronounced vein, thin and protruding, but after a moment I began to notice an unmistakable movement as the skin above shifted with a decidedly unnatural affect. \n\n“Huh.” she breathed, as if I’d simply pointed out an errant string on a piece of clothing. \n\nI watched in confusion and disgust as she lowered her hand, settling the worm-like thing between her fingers onto the lip of one of the cups before her finger began pressing against the lump in her skin.\n\nI felt like I was going to vomit as a silent, squelching sound could be heard with each movement. \n\n“I’m gonna go say hi to Chelsea,” the words tumbled forth, as I turned my head staring into the living room and avoiding looking her way. \n\n“T - then I should get going, it’s - I have homework.” I could see her from the corner of my eye, heading tilting curiously as she looked at me. \n\nI didn’t want to look, couldn’t, the bubbling in my stomach telling me one more unpleasant sight might reintroduce me to my lunch from earlier, but I couldn’t help but see from the corner of my eye as she began to pull…something from beneath the lid.\n\nMy heart pounded, a sore, acidic taste welling in my throat, and swallowed hard against it.\n\n“It -  It was good seeing you, Ky.” I said, making my way to the living room before she could say anything else, pausing only to add, “I’ll go look in on Chelsea, but I think you guys should see a doctor.” \n\nI left it at that, not feeling comfortable explaining just how odd they were all behaving. She didn’t bother to respond, and when I saw why I turned and left the room before I could lose my lunch. The tip of her index finger was below her lower eyelid, as she moved it around pulling at something….what, I didn’t stay to find out\n\nI nodded a silent greeting to Tracy as I passed, feeling far too sick to my stomach to speak for a moment. As I entered the room, a drop of water fell before me, making a soft *plink* in the carpet before me. \n\nI glanced up at the ceiling, taken aback at the sight before me. The drywall seemed to sag ever so slightly, forming a hanging bubble on the ceiling, drops of water falling from its bulging center. I  locked eyes with Tracy for a moment, her own gaze traveling from the drop on the floor, to the ceiling, and back to me with a look that was almost frantic in its fear, as though she was terrified of what I may ask next.\n\n“Chelsea’s upstairs?” I asked, doing my best to keep my voice even. I could feel Kyla’s presence behind me, and was beginning to feel all too surrounded. I wanted to see Chelsea, and *go*.\n\nTracy’s eyes met mine for a moment, before quickly breaking contact as she peered down at the carpet. Something in her expression made my heart skip a beat. \n\n“Tracy? Is Chelsea upstairs?”\n\nShe nodded slowly, before whispering,\n\n“In the bathtub.” Her voice was low and uneven, hollow almost, like hearing some A.I. recreation of the real thing, missing that inherent human sort of liveliness.\n\nI made my way to the stairs, casting an uneasy glance over my shoulder back into the living room. Kyle stood under the doorway of the kitchen, peering back at me with an expression I didn’t like. A glance over at Tracy revealed she, too, was watching eyes wide and body taken with slight tremors.\n\nIt revealed something else too, as I caught the tail end of something long and thin, as it disappeared beneath the collar of her shirt. It was an all too familiar sight after what had taken place in the kitchen, and one that made my lingering need to vomit all the more pronounced. \n\nI glanced into the nearest of the mugs on the table, stomach turning at what I expected to find. \n\nMy head spun as I saw what lie in the cup. Contained within maybe an inch of water, there was a swarm of those long thin insects, like so many tiny snakes, curled around each other until I could only see a thrashing mass of movement at the bottom of the cup.\n\nFeeling a pit form in my gut, and all the more certain I needed to be gone as soon as possible I began to climb the stairs towards the hallway leading to the bathroom. \n\nChelsea had been my best friend for years, and if anything the weirdness with the others now had me slightly worried for her. It wasn’t as though I imagined they might have done something to her. \n\nNo, even for how strange they were behaving, I knew Kyla and Tracy, and they’d never hurt her. \n\nStill, since I’d stepped foot in the house things had seemed…wrong, and only gotten moreso. I felt an almost suffocating unease as I wondered just what state she might be in comparatively, looking at the two of them.\n\nAs I stepped onto the stairs, I flicked the light switch, once then twice, anticipation turning into disquiet as the darkness remained.\n\n“We...took the bulbs out. She didn’t like the light.” Tracy’s voice was small, almost a whisper as though she were sharing something she ought not to be.\n\nThere was little to no light guiding the way, the hallway pitch black, and the windows in the rooms curtain shut tight, leaving me to feel for a light switch as I made my way up. \n\nThe stairs creaked underfoot as I arrived at the landing, and a glance over my shoulder revealed both Tracy and Kyla standing opposite each other at the bottom of the stairs. \n\nTracy shuddered, her body shivering as though the temperature in the house was in the negatives, scratching violently at her cheek for a moment which appeared to…well, I couldn’t be sure with the distance, perhaps it was just a muscle spasm, but in the moment her flesh appeared it shift in response to the touch. \n\nKyla just watched, teeth grinding as she worked her jaw from side to side, a smile on her face that looked deeply out of place. \n\nThey watched me with wide, glassy eyes that seemed almost…hungry, in the darkness the gaunt shape of their faces casting eerie shadows across their features.\n\nThe lingering pit of anxiety had only worsened as throughout this visit, now feeling like a boulder in my gut. \n\nAny distant thought I may have had of turning back abated by the sight of them watching me, peering around the corner like sneaking children.\n\nMy heart strummed rapidly, and I swallowed hard against the lump I could feel forming in my throat, head buzzing with the din of anxiety.\n\nDespite their behavior, now fully past unusual and into well creepy territory, I continued on, that unease lingered over me like a stubborn fog. \n\nAs I passed Chelsea’s room, I peered inside. It was dark , though even with the lack of light, I could see it was in a state of utter disarray. \n\nUsing the light of my phone, I stepped inside and looked around. \n\nThe room smelled of sweat, blood and sickness. I pulled my shirt over my nose,  the acrid taste of bile filling my mouth.\n\nI looked down at the dresser, seeing one of Chelsea’s vet school textbooks open, several papers and notes surrounding it, covered in her illegible handwriting, her laptop sat beside it. A tap to one of the buttons told me it was dead, seemingly having been sitting unused for a while. I glanced down at the textbook, my brow furrowing as I took in its contents.\n\nIt was a book pertaining to various insects and parasites one might encounter in the veterinary field, and the page was open to one particular section. I recognized the creature depicted immediately, I’d seen dozens of them sense I’d arrived.\n\nHorsehair Worm: *Nematomorpha are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. Most species range in size from 50 to 100 millimetres long, reaching 2 metres in extreme cases, and 1 to 3 millimetres in diameter.*\n\n*Harmless to humans, but this worm is deadly to its pray. Once it finds the perfect victim, it will burrow its way inside, altering the victims mindstate and behaviors, leading ultimately to their death as the horsehair worm drives it to drown itself in order to lay its eggs in water.*\n\n“A parasitic worm…” I spoke the thought aloud, my skin crawling once more as I recalled being touched by one of the things. \n\nI was no entomologist, but I’d heard of things like that; parasites that could take over the mind of an unwitting host, usually some poor insect, driving them to destructive behaviors. \n\nMy mind turned immediately to Kyla and Tracy, to their strange behavior and the way their skin seemed to move as though something was burrowing beneath… \n\nNo. I tried to dismiss the conclusion beginning to form, though it clung stubbornly. Were my friends under the effect of some animal parasite? Whatever was happening, something told me only Chelsea would know. It seemed she was already looking into things.\n\nA sound from the darkness ahead made me jump, something between a cough and a hacking.\n\nOn the far wall, a trail of those insects moved in disturbing unison, forming several trails as they all traveled into one corner of the room, the corner from which I’d heard the sound. It was dark, behind the long dresser against the wall, keeping it out of the light. \n\nReluctantly I stepped forward, casting the light into the corner. I gasped despite myself, sucking in a mouthful of the awful air, sending me into an awful coughing fit. \n\nI couldn’t help it any longer, raising my shirt as a mouthful of vomit forced spewed forth. \n\nIn the corner, sat Marlo, or what was left of the poor creature anyways. With all that had happened, I had forgotten the cat was half of the reason I was there. By the look of it, the creature was clinging to life, if it could even be called that, by a thread.\n\nThe right side of its face was gone, revealing flesh that was a patchwork mix of pale white and an inflamed, infected sort of red. In the gaping hole where its eye had one been, I could see those things moving in and out by the dozens. They covered him like so many massive fleas, and it didn’t take long to see what they were doing.\n\nThey were burrowing into his skin, moving through the fur and flesh, embedding themselves until only the smallest part was visible, appearing like thin, stiff strands of hair.\n\nHe tried to hiss, opening his mouth but managing little more than a crackle mewl.\n\n“No, oh no, Marlo. You poor baby.” I felt my eyes burn with tears, heart pounding. \n\nFor a moment it raised its head, and in its other eye I could see all of the pain it was in. Yet, in an instance it shifted. Without warning, it was on its feet. \n\nA look of animal rage filled its features, all the more horrifying given the state of it, as it began to stumble forth under legs that looked utterly destroyed, just a few visible tendons holding fur to bone, moving as though it was still learning their use.\n\nIt tried to hiss, this time making a sound between a hack and a growl, as a cloud of those wriggling horrors were sent forth from its mouth.\n\nMy heart thrummed against my chest, as I took a step back, its hiss rising to an awful yowl made worse by visible damage to its throat, which had been eaten away at so thoroughly I could see through it.\n\nIt stumbled forth with a sudden burst of speed, hacking up another cloud of the writhing things, nearly nipping me as it caught me off guard. \n\n“Marlo,” My voice shook, as I stepped back, head spinning. \n\nIt hissed again, and when it did, its jaw snapped out of place, whatever tendon had been holding it tearing as the right side of its mouth hung impossibly wide. \n\nIt started forward again, and I scampered back glancing over my shoulder at the door.\n\nIt was as though the cat knew what I was thinking, and as I turned to make my break for the doorway, it burst out into an uneven, frantic sprint in my direction, mouth hanging open as those things fell from its face with blood and saliva.\n\nI ran, hurrying out of the room and slamming the door shut just as in time for it to collide against it, hissing and clawing furiously from the other side. For a moment, I remained there, pressed against the door and catching my breath before I felt something against my sock. Peering down, I could see a trail of those things, horsehair worms, I now knew, moving in unison from under the door and up my foot.\n\nI stomped and kicked and shook until every last one was gone, stumbling away from the door. \n\nAfter a few moments to regain my composure, the sight of poor Marlo still fresh in mind, I peered down the stairs for the other two girls. They still stood there, watching me with big, empty eyes. A trickle of drool could be seen running down the corner of Tracy’s lips as she watched me.\n\nI wanted to run, to speed past them and out the door but…my mind turned to Chelsea. I had to see her, with things seeming so wrong in the house, I had to be sure she was alright.\n\nThe bathroom was the last door at the end of the hall. It was shut tight, with only a small hint of light visible from the crack beneath, and with each step I made towards it I felt the knot in my throat grow until…\n\n*Squish*.\n\nI recoiled at the squelching sound beneath my feet, my foot suddenly soaked as I stepped onto damp carpet. There was water spilling out from beneath the doorway, and by the way it had spread out in a circle for almost four feet of the hallway carpet, it had been doing so for quite a while. \n\nMy heart leapt in my chest, my entire body seeming to buzz with a shock of panic, as I quickly covered the rest of the ground between myself and the door, pounding three knocks against its frame. After several moments, suffocating on the tension that seemed content to strangle me with the knot in  my throat, I tried to knob. It turned without an issue, unlocked.\n\nTaking a breath, I pushed inside.\n\nA swell of water poured forth, running past my feet and into the surrounding rug. As I moved the door aside, I was taken aback by the sight of the bathroom. The walls, for a moment, appeared dark and writhing, until I realized that I hadn’t seen the walls at all, instead looking at a sheet of insects so thick it covered almost every inch of the place.\n\n“Oh, oh *god…*” \n\nMy blood ran cold at the sight.\n\nI couldn’t see inside of the bathtub, the curtain, also rife with the horrid things was closed, but I could hear the running water and faint sloshing sounds from just behind the curtain, the unmistakable sounds of movement within the tub. \n\nMy body was wracked but faint tremors, adrenaline, panic, and sheer disgust all coursing through me in waves, and the contents of my stomach twisting and turning at the thought of millions of little insects slithering over me. \n\nThe floor was slick to the touch, water soaking every inch, discoloring the bottoms of the cabinets, sloshing as I reluctantly made my way into the room.\n\nI shrieked, unable to help myself as I felt something hit my neck, cold and thin. I knew immediately what it was, slapping at the back of my neck furiously until I saw it fall onto the ground, washed out of the room in the streaming water. \n\nMy skin crawled, and my eyes burned with tears, everything about this feeling like a waking nightmare as I stood before the bathtub, reaching for the shower curtain. \n\nI pulled the curtain aside with a hiss of the metal hooks against the rod, and in an instant I was face to face with a picture of horror. A scream ripped through me, loud and shrill, for what felt like minutes, head spinning with a sort of lightheadedness to when I stood up too fast. \n\nChelsea was dead surely, the sight of her indicating she must have been so for quite some time. Her body was nearly unrecognizable, lying at the bottom of the tub utterly swollen and waterlogged, and her eyes…they were open, a glassy yellow staring up at me frozen in a look of utter horror. \n\nIt would have been horrifying enough, had that been all, but from every inch of exposed skin, I could see holes riddled as those things, the worms burrowed their way out en masse. \n\nBefore I could move, reach for my phone to call the police or do anything of the sort, her mouth snapped open with such force I wondered if somehow she was still living. \n\nThe idea was stomped out by a wash of cold dread, as it continued to stretch, and stretch, until it was far past the limit of anything that ought to be possible for the human body.\n\nAt once, something began to emerge. It was large, a dark, shiny black like the carapace of a beetle. It began to slowly pull itself forth, shifting her head and stomach at points as something that appeared less like an insect, and more a massive snake began to unfurl through the water. \n\nIt took only a few moments for me to realize what I was looking at. I took a step back as the massive worm began to thrash about the water, sending drops spraying in my direction. \n\nIt had to be no less than five, maybe six feet in length, and from its surface it seemed to shed dozens of its smaller counterparts.\n\nA creak from just beyond the door caught my ear. I turned just in time to see Tracy and Kyla bounding towards me, their faces utterly expressionless as either one of them grabbed me by an arm.\n\n“What the fuck are you doing?!” I shrieked, struggling to pull myself free of their grip, which felt like iron. \n\nI struggled for purchase against the wet floor, realizing quickly where they were bringing me, as they began to drag me towards the tub. \n\nI felt the familiar sensation of those cold, tiny insects beginning to slide along my wrist, and could almost feel myself lose consciousness as I saw them pushing forth from Kyla and Tracy’s arms, burrowing out of skin like dirt, and crawling along my own.\n\nMy skin stung where they settled, and it didn’t take long to realize what was happening as so many needle-like sensations began to blaze through my forearms. \n\nThey were burrowing…forcing themselves through my skin with excruciating effect. \n\n“Tracy, Ky, please get off of me, I -”  as I struggled pleading desperately in a vein effort to appeal to my friends, knowing already that it was useless, the sight of both girls filled me with a renewed terror. \n\nBoth of their mouths hung open, so wide I was certain something in both of their jaws must have dislocated, and from it emerged the front half of creatures identical to that which had just emerged from Chelsea’s body.\n\nIt became horrifyingly apparent what they intended to do to me.\n\nI fought, pushing hard against them to no avail as they brought my head closer to the tub.\n\nThe smell…it made my eyes water and stomach turn. My arm screamed with excruciating pain as three of the creatures attempted to burrow beneath my skin.\n\nI felt a hand grip the back of my hair, forcing me towards the water. That thing, it coiled as, its body twisting and slipping into itself, writhing with something as similar to anticipation as such an alien form could permit, as it slowly rose up the side of the tub to meet me. \n\nI could see my face in its carapace as it approached, its body an oily black and smelling strongly of bile.\n\nMy arms sang with a stinging pain, a sensation like having fingers digging beneath my skin setting every nerve alight.\n\nI had one chance to act, one opportunity to do *something* and little time to do it before I was a walking, talking *infestation* like my friends had become. \n\nMy hair hung in the water below. I winced as they pressed my head against the side of the tub, my chin digging into the porcelain as my mouth was pried open.\n\nThe pain and panic lit my mind on fire. I let out a shriek, a shrill, primal sound like nothing I could imagine myself making, feeling a final surge of adrenaline. I pulled my legs in close so they were tucked beneath me, then out in front of me, and with all I could manage, kicked out against the bathtub. \n\nThe sudden force sent me sliding back against the wet floor, taking the other girls off guard and making them momentarily lose both their grip and balance.\n\nThat thing emerged from over the edge of the tub, its head twisting in the air expectantly. I knew I had no time to think, scrambling and slipping to my feet, as I made a b-line for the door.\n\n“NO!”\n\nTracy screeched in a voice that hardly seemed her own. I didn’t want to risk a glance back, unwilling to slow down as I barrelled towards, and down the stairs, desperately trying not to slip against the slick wood.\n\nI could feel them behind me, my arms throbbing with a radiating pain that served as a reminder of why I needed to move, as I reached the door.\n\nI quickly turned the lock and pulled it open, disregarding my shoes only a few feet away as I stumbled out into the night\n\nAs I clamored down the stone steps, feeling safe to chance a glance behind me, I could see Kyla reaching out from the doorway, her clawing hands just missing my shirt.\n\nTracy stood beside her, peering past us, face darkened in an expression that made my skin crawl.\n\nThere was a man walking his dog on the sidewalk just beyond watching us, the clamor of my exit having caught his attention. He looked on with an expression of mild interest and unease.\n\nI pulled the gate open, thankful for the distraction as   I practically tripped over myself onto the sidewalk, landing on my knees a few feet in front of the man and his dog, which barked furiously at the doorway, its eyes never leaving Kyla or Tracy. \n\n\"Are - are you okay, ma'am?\" he spoke. \n\n\"Do you need me to call someone?\"\n\nThe reluctance and unease palpable in his voice as he looked between myself, disheveled and wet, arms trialed with ribbons of blood, and the girls in the doorway. \n\nMy head swam, and after a moment I made my way back to my feet, not taking my eyes off of the doorway from which Tracy and Kyla stood, watching me with those dead, empty eyes.\n\nA sharp pain in my right arm snapped my attention back to it, and my skin crawled as I saw why. Two of those things hung halfway from newly created holes on the skin, still attempting to burrow beneath. \n\nI could hardly help myself, I gripped the first then the second by the half of their body still exposed, and gritting my teeth, yanked with all my might. \n\nThe sensation was excruciating, tears springing into my eyes as I could hear the wet *pop* upon their release. \n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" the man took a step away as I tossed them to the ground, stomping down furiously upon them, his eyes wide as he stared at my arm. \n\nHe looked as though he was going to be sick, and I couldn't blame him. I raised my hand breathlessly, to motion for him that I was alright. I would surely call the police, my friends needed medical attention and Chelsea… I pushed the thought from my head, feeling emotion threatening to bubble to the surface, I just wanted to gather myself before I did so.\n\nThe dog barked at me furiously, urging me to take a step back, growling as its head swiveled between myself and the doorway, as though it were unsure of who the threat was. \n\nMy eyes locked with Kyla’s then Tracy’s as they looked over me. I couldn’t be sure, but it seemed in the moment, cast in the shadow of that dark house, as though the girls bore the slightest of smirks. I could feel Kyla’s eyes on my arm, and followed her gaze. \n\nAt the back of my forearm, what appeared to be a vein extended out past the skin, bulging unnaturally.\n\nWith only a brief nod, the momentary motion filled with darker meaning than I could understand the two disappeared back into the house, moving as if with a single mind. \n\nI wanted to feel relief, or calm, anything other than what I felt in that moment, which was an unshakeable lingering sense that, in one way or another, they’d accomplished what they’d intended.\n\nUnsure of what to do, and feeling very uneasy in my own skin, I bid the shell-shocked man farewell with a nod and a tight smile, mind still reeling as I turned and pressed forth from my car. As I made the same walk back that I had made on my way to their door, it occurred to me how drastically my view of what was possible, what horrors this world contains had been distorted in a single evening. \n\nAs I started my drive, my mind awash in chaos as I made my way in silence, watching the streetlights glow pass overhead, I squeezed hard against the steering wheel, my eyes traveling to the vein on my forearm. Had it always been there?\n\nI called the police when I got home. Upon searching the house and finding no trace of any of the three girls, or even the cat, I was given a stern warning on the wastefulness and consequences of prank calls to the police. \n\nI suppose I should be worried about that. About the potential of Kyla and Tracy and whatever horrible parasites they were under the effect of coming after me, but truthfully my mind has been on other things.\n\nI find I’ve been taken by a strange sort of twitch recently, a spasm that started in my arm and seems to be spreading through my body with time. Even as I right this, I can see the muscle in my arm contracting, shifting as if by some other power.\n\nPerhaps it’s just nervous energy. That’s what I'll keep telling myself.\n\nI don’t want to consider the alternative.",

        "text": "Time\n\nThe greatest, yet most terrifying of mysteries that pervade the universe. Man has driven himself, his own flesh and blood, his entire race to the grave, clawing and scratching to escape the crushing force of time’s arrow. \n\nTime, you see, takes everything, everyone, and in the end, darkness is all that’s left.\n\nFor as far back as I can remember, that darkness, the inky eternal void of space, has been my one true passion, a refuge for my overactive imagination and curiosity of the expanse of spacetime we inhabited. The finest wines, intoxicants, women and men alike, nothing could ignite my fever, nor chill my blood quite like the ever expanding void of the cosmos.\n\nMine had been a time of debauchery, indulgence, and excess, though only at the highest levels of society. The politicians, ever so arrogant and unaware of the trouble brewing outside their own doors, had done nothing for centuries, nothing to help our land escape the decay of its indulgence, nor anything to appease the bourgeoisie they had so viciously exploited for far too long. Revolution had been inevitable for many years, so when it came, it came swiftly and brutally. \n\nThe endless war stretched on, and with every fallen soldier sent back home in a hallowed box, my hope and resolve for our world, our kind, our way of life, dwindled away. The neverending hordes of soldiers and fallen comrades, sights so horrible and so full of despair, my heart wept for every drop of blood spilled. After four years of senseless genocide, our power hungry generals, fat with pride, refused to stop the onslaught, even if it meant making every other woman in our country a widow. Day after day I would look young men in the eyes, lie to them and tell them they’d all be going home for the holidays, knowing it would be the last thing they would ever hear. \n\nSleep was a precious luxury only afforded on the rarest of occasions. The screams of my wounded and dying troops, haunting as they were, melted away in the pitch black expanse of the night sky. I yearned for a way out, an escape from this godforsaken rock and a way to explore the cosmos for the rest of my existence.\n\nIf you could sell your soul for whatever you wanted, what would you wish for?\n\nWe’ve probably all either wondered or been asked a variation of this question in our lives. Money, wealth, power, the return of a loved one or the heart of another. Most of us couldn’t even fathom what it would mean to give up your soul, your very essence, for a chance to have your dreams come true. Most wouldn’t know what to do with that newfound power once given it, and most would die unfulfilled and just as dead on the inside, with only eternal damnation to look forward to.\n\nThe funny thing about hell though, is that fire can get awfully tempting then you're stuck on an iceberg. \n\nOne night, one cloudless night. \n\nI remember it well. \n\nIt’s one of the few days that remain as clear to me now as in the moment it had happened. It was night, the sun had long slipped beyond the horizon and was already barreling back towards the other side. I’d found a spot around 30 or so yards away from the main camp, just far enough away to wear the screams of agony were mere whispers. I looked up into the cloudless sky, saw the thousands of glimmering stars, shining from billions of light-years into space, dreaming of the day humanity would finally gain access to the cosmos.\n\nI prayed, for the first time in over a decade, for the chance to make those dreams a reality. I would give everything, live a thousand and one eternities in hell for just a chance at divine ecstasy. \n\n*Please, please god. Just this once.*\n\nIn that same second, a rumbling nearby broke me from my trance. Bombs. Another raid perhaps. I sat upright quickly and looked towards the coming storm. More rumbling. The camp had been alerted and was sounding the alarm. I had to act fast. Desertion had been considered a crime of ultimate cowardice, of betrayal. Only the lowest rat of the foulest sewer would abandon their duty to their country in times of war, especially when we were so close to victory. \n\nOnly I knew that to be a lie. There was no going back from the atrocities our country had committed in the name of honor and power. I wanted nothing more to do with the fat bureaucrats masquerading as leaders, or the country they’d led into ruin. My mind was already made up. I scanned my surroundings, and thankfully, the hill I’d chosen gave me a decent view of the clearing, even in the dark. I looked for anything, any sign of a town or house. There was a smattering of smoke to the west illuminated by flickering lights, an isolated woodland village, or so I hoped. It didn't matter. I’d already committed to my path and began running down the hill towards the lights, away from my life and everything I’d ever known. \n\nNot a moment too soon as it turned out, as a deafening explosion roared behind me just seconds later. The ground shook and threatened to send me on my feet, but my extensive training had largely cured me of my clumsiness, and so I was able to retain my balance as a torrent of scorched earth rained down all around me. The treeline was thankfully just yards away from my original spot, and the undergrowth provided plenty of protection for me to regain my bearings. \n\nJust a dozen or so yards to my left, another explosion sounded off, and the smell of fuel and fire began to fill the air around me. Having only barely caught my breath moments before, I broke out into another full sprint, my padded clothing providing plenty of protection from the thick brush. A hail of gunfire followed another explosion, further to my right, and I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking I’d escaped whomever had given chase. \n\nIt only took five or so minutes to reach the village, which was rather quaint compared to the bustling city I’d come from. The population had largely fled judging from the vacant shops and abandoned vehicles in the streets, which was perfect for me. If I wanted to survive on my own, I was going to need supplies. \n\nI’d never stolen a single item, not even a loaf of bread, in my entire life before the war. I certainly wasn’t proud of it, and harbored tremendous guilt even given the circumstances. I rationalized that I would return to repay the debt once I’d gotten settled, which was a feeble endeavor in it of itself. My conflicted morality aside, I crept through the dark and quiet streets, taking note of the surprisingly lack of destruction despite the raging war only a stone's throw away. \n\nI chose what looked to be an antique shop of some kind, possibly full of valuable treasures I could pawn off for somewhere else. The break-in itself was easy enough, as none of the doors were locked. After checking the back, I decided on the basement cellar, thinking the most valuable items would be stored there. Closing the doors behind me, the previously quiet night was soon full of the sounds of twisted, rusty metal. I held my breath for a moment, sure my cover had already been blown. After about a minute or so, I assumed the coast was clear and proceeded forward.\n\nJust as I had predicted, the cellar was indeed filled to the brim with antiques and oddities, the likes I’d never seen before. There were the usual items, such as ornamental clocks and music boxes, all unfortunately coated in a fine layer of soot and dust. But then there were other items, objects so mysterious and foreign, I couldn’t decipher their origin or purpose. There was this rather plain looking ruby gemstone embedded in an ancient slab of rock, inscribed with an ancient language I had no hope in translating. Thinking it might be worth something, I grabbed it and placed it in my rucksack. There were other stones of varying color and size. As beautiful as they were, most of them wouldn’t fetch me much on their own, and I was going to have limited carrying space as it was. As I turned a corner, I saw there was a section of the cellar that had been sectioned off by several bookcases and a hole-ridden drape. In every store, there’s always a section where you store the “real” goods, treasures too valuable to sit on the floor, and I assumed that this was theirs. \n\nCasting the drapes aside, I was met with a single shelf with only a handful of items that looked quite ordinary at first glance. Another gemstone, this one a deep amber, what looked like a set of daggers wrapped in a leather sheath, and a jar of liquid containing what I assumed to be a human brain. A little off putting for sure, but far from the most gruesome sight I’d ever seen. \n\nYou should see brains when they’re not in a jar. \n\nI’m sure there was a long backstory for why each of these objects had been set aside, but apart from their admittedly intriguing presentation, nothing stood out as being particularly valuable. As I was turning to leave, I caught the glint of something from the bottom shelf, something I’d overlooked. Bending over to get a better look, I reach out to grab the shiny metallic object. \n\nIt was an ornate oil lamp, by far the most intricate and exotic I’d ever seen. The material was of the finest quality, a glossy black metal that was quite heavy for such a small object. There was no wording or description, at least nothing I could make out. Instead, there was only a series of abstract shapes spawning off from the open brim that branched off into a series of strands, encircling the entire lamp. It was indescribably beautiful, yet there was something almost sinister about its iridescent black hue, the way it appeared to absorb light instead of reflecting it. \n\nThis moment, out of the endless more that would come, I remember so vividly; the weight of the lamp in my hand, the musty smell of the cellar, everything is still so clear after all these years. \n\nIf given the chance, would I do anything differently? Would I place the lamp back on the shelf and continue on with my original plan? \n\nCould I?\n\nSurely though, it was surely worth a fortune, all I needed was to find the right vendor. My home country was well known for its black market trading, so provided I found passage back, finding a buyer shouldn’t take too long. I reached to grab it, but no sooner had my fingers touched the surface, a thunderous explosion sent me and the contents of the entire shelf to the floor. I barely registered the sound of gunfire before another loud blast sent a shower of burning wood right on top of me. \n\nStruggling under the intense pain and growing mountain of debris, I struggled in vain to regain my senses. Sound was completely gone and my vision was quickly fading as well. Through the dark, I could briefly make out a hazy orange glow which quickly revealed itself as fire.  With great difficulty, I managed to drag myself from under what I later saw to be a large section of the floor above me. The night sky was visible, though barely so under the growing plume of smoke billowing out of the basement. Getting back on my feet, I began to frantically search the cellar for the exit, but to my dismay, the growing inferno had already consumed the wooden staircase leading up to the store front. \n\nPanic began to set in as I tried to double back and search for the way I had originally come in. The suffocatingly thick smoke had already filled the room and my already severely reduced vision became fuzzier with each passing breath. Stumbling to my knees once more, I wheezed as I cried out for someone, anyone to help me. But there was no one, no one to return my cries but a rapid fire of torched bullets. With the last breath I thought I’d take, I collapsed to the floor and looked upwards to the sky. Though the smoke had clouded much of my view, I was still able to make out a handful of glittering stars. I tensed up and closed my eyes, readying myself mentally for a pain beyond comprehension.\n\nThat was when my hands felt the metallic surface of the lamp, still wrapped in my fingers. Somehow it had remained tethered to me despite all the destruction around me. Despite the raging fire around me, the lamp remained cold to the touch, providing some relief from the surging heat. I thought it was funny, how I would die in this basement, burning in agony all because of this lamp. Maybe someone would find my skeleton years later, the lamp still firmly grasped to my hand.\n\nThey’d probably have to break my fingers off in order to get the lamp.\n\nThe thought made me chuckle, and in that moment, I felt an aura of peace I’d never experienced before in my life. I was ready. No, I’d always been ready. The fire I’d always been searching for was now just within reach. I waited, fully at peace with the fate that was about to befall me.\n\nOnly the fire never came. \n\nAnd oh how I wish it had.\n\nInstead, a tugging at my arm was followed by a firm yet gentle pull as my entire body was drug slowly away. I protested at first, not wanting that fleeting glimmer of serenity to fade, but it was too late. The heat from the fire had already washed away as waves of cool air made their way into my weakened lungs. I coughed, wheezed, and stuttered before my eyes finally flickered open. I was outside, the beautiful night sky now fully visible with only hints of smoke to block the view. I’d stopped moving, and with what little strength I had left, propped myself up to get a look at my rescuer. \n\nAt first I thought my eyes had deceived me, that the smoke inhalation and adrenaline were affecting my cognitive abilities. Though I was certainly far from the largest of my troops, I still had put on a hefty amount of weight and muscle, and therefore it would have taken a great deal of effort to lift me from a burning cellar.\n\nYet as I continued to blink and rub my eyes, the tiny form of an old beggar woman only became more and more apparent. I was stunned of course, yet no less grateful. I smiled and sprung to my feet, intending to thank her eternally for saving my life, but was sent back down to the ground by a growing intense pain spreading from my lower leg, the one that’d been almost crushed in the basement. The woman helped me to stand, retorting quickly under breath, so quietly I almost didn’t catch her.\n\n“It’s not safe here. Follow me”\n\nHer words had a cool, clipped inflection that flowed wonderfully with her accent. I nodded my head and followed her, limping along as we slowly made our way back into the woods and away from the burning village. For such an old woman, I had trouble keeping pace with her, and several times I lost sight of her ghostly white hair in the brush, only for her to somehow end up behind me, always with a smile. \n\nBefore too long, we arrived at a tiny cottage, probably a mile or so away from the village. The smell of burning wood and gunpowder was still thick in the air, but the muffled explosions told us we were a good enough distance away to relax for the time being. Inside the cabin, which was surprisingly warm and maintained for such an isolated spot, the elderly woman set about taking care of my injuries. With the adrenaline wearing off, surges of pain were beginning to spread from just about every part of my body. \n\nMy groan and cries did little to desaude my caretaker from doing her job. In fact, with each little grunt or cry of anguish, she would gaze deeply into my eyes with the gentlest look in hers, and any pain I had felt would vanish. She had a healing power to her, that much was obvious. Perhaps she had been a doctor’s assistant or surgeon, for she moved with great precision and speed. \n\nMy leg had suffered a minor fracture that would heal in a month's time, she promised, and my lungs and eyes needed to rest after so much exposure to toxic fumes. With a gin and tonic, along with some beautiful pink capsule she’d provided, I was out within seconds. A dreamless sleep was exactly what I needed, and the next morning I arose just minutes after the break of dawn. The old woman was already awake, preparing quite the selection of food fit for an entire army. \n\nAs we ate, she asked me about my post, my life before the war. I answered each question without any in return, my only desire at that moment was satisfying the hunger that had gone unsatiated for many years. So famished was I, I didn’t quite register her next question which I almost answered on impulse.\n\n“So you have abandoned your post then?”\n\nI stopped, only allowing myself to swallow the last gulp of food before looking down in shame. Of course, she would have to ask that. A myriad of possible answers came to mind, but none of them sufficed. Besides, what good would it be to lie to this stranger, this old woman who’d rescued me from a burning building. But just as I was about to answer, suddenly I had a question of my own. One I’d been dwelling over ever since my rescue.\n\n“How’d you rescue me from that fire?” I asked blankly, staring deep into her amber eyes. The layers of wrinkles and swirls of gray hair disguised a former beauty and deep intellect, someone who at one point, or perhaps still was, a person of significance and grace. A woman that was not to be trifled with. She only smiled, pausing for a second before answering.\n\n“I saw you come into the shop.” Though her outwardly shell had seen better days, her voice was strong, echoing loudly over top of my own. I continued to study her, my years of training now analyzing her every move, our surroundings, anything that would clue me in on who this mysterious woman was. Still, my thoughts flashed back to my intrusion into the shop, and my attempted theft. The lamp, which was now safely resting in my side pocket, suddenly felt ten tons heavier. \n\n“It was your shop then?” I replied back, the guilt and shame growing by the second. \n\n“It’d been my home for many years, yes. Don’t worry yourself though, I’m happy to be free of it.” the woman said with a smile, and as I looked closer, I noticed something unsettling that I had not dawned on me yet.\n\nHer voice. It had been raspy and soft in the forest, but inside the cabin it had grown sharp and stronger. But that wasn't the only thing.\n\nHer skin. \n\nUnder the dim moonlight, it had appeared worn and wrinkled, but under the glow of the warm fire it was smoother, more defined. The long eroded beauty that time had taken away seemed to thrive in the little wooded oasis. She didn’t appear to notice my studious gaze, as she was seemingly locked into one of her own. Our eyes finally met after a few moments, and the instant they did, I could have sworn she looked even younger. A good decade seemed to have been wiped from the woman's face seemingly overnight. \n\nFinally, she spoke up once more. \n\n“You never answered my question young man. Have you abandoned your post as lieutenant?” \n\nI was immediately caught off guard once again as an icy chill coursed it way throughout my body, filling every vein with a chilly sting and raising every hair on my body. I hadn’t told her my rank, only that I’d been serving in the armed forces and had fled in the middle of the night. Nervously, I decided to play her game, see what else she knew.  \n\n“Well, not just my post. My life, such as it is.” I was honest and to the point, no need for lies here. Besides, I had a feeling she would detect them the minute they left my lips. \n\nShe smiled and nodded, as if expecting the answer. She closed her eyes for a moment and whispered something to herself so softly I had no hope in hearing what it was. She then looked back at me with the most intense, longing expression, like she was seeing right into my very soul. \n\n“You harbor a tremendous pain inside you my dear, you’ve carried it with you for as long as you could walk. An aching, to see sights not of this world, to leave your wretched society of excess and hypocrisy behind. I’ve seen your pain reflected in the faces of monarchs, swindlers, and tradesmen from every corner of the globe. It’s an insidious pain that grows patiently, slowly decaying the body and soul from the inside. It becomes a cancer, feeding on misery, propelling us further into the void.”\n\nIt was astounding, listening to her as she spoke. Thoughts and desires, never utter aloud to another soul, now coming straight from these strangers lips as if she were peering straight into the very recesses of my mind. I couldn't help but feel somewhat…violated, now that my deepest kept secrets were out in the open. There was nowhere to run from them in this place. \n\n“How did you know-” I was about to say before she cut me off, anticipating this question for some time no doubt. \n\n“I know a great many things, young man. My time here in this world has been long and filled to the brim with heartache and suffering. I'm well acquainted with the same pain you’ve tried in vain to run away from your entire life. You crave an escape, a chance to quench your thirst for adventure. I can feel the fires of passion burning bright, yearning to be set free. Would you like me to help you, to set the fire free?” \n\nShe spoke with such reverence, such conviction, as if she were giving a sermon and I was her only congregation. I was confused, unsure of how to proceed forward. Her youthful emergence and strange yet prophetic ramblings belied her true intentions. She was guiding me towards some already predetermined destination, and I was powerless to resist. Curiosity had always been the thorn in my side, constantly getting me into all manner of trouble. Eager to know what she had to offer me, a runaway ex-soldier chasing the stars, I asked the question, that fatal question that would decide my fate forever.\n\n“How? How could you possibly help me?”\n\nShe looked back into my eyes with that same soul piercing gaze she’d had before. The wrinkles that had been so thoroughly ingrained into her skin minutes ago had all but vanished, leaving only a few scattered ridges behind. Her radiant beauty now shined brighter than the evening star, with little resemblance to the beggar woman who’d rescued me. \n\nWhat was this trickery? A slight of hand perhaps? There’d been old wise tales from my childhood about witches and dark magic that dwelled in the nether regions, places too far and too cold for mortal man to trespass. I’d never been one for superstition before. But fear has a funny way of making you a believer. \n\n“What if I told you I could give you what you desire? A chance to make all your wildest dreams come true. The adventure you desperately seek is out there, I promise you, it exists. A place halfway between reality and fantasy, between the real and the unreal; it’s just beyond that blue veil my child. I’ve seen it, and many other places. Worlds just like this one, some stranger and alien beyond comprehension. Endless universes, full of every possibility and more, awaits you! You’ve never been so close!”\n\nHer passion was infectious, so much so that I almost believed her. \n\nAlmost. \n\nI’d been the victim of fraud before, and she wouldn’t be the last trickster to try and swindle me as far as I was concerned. Perhaps she meant well, maybe even believed her own delusions of grandeur. Perhaps I was suffering from a psychotic break, which would certainly explain the woman’s ever changing appearance. I’m not sure why I continued to play along with her charade when all I wanted was to leave and forget I’d ever encountered this strange person, my blood oath to her be damned. \n\nBut how does that phrase go again, about curiosity and the cat?\n\n“So what? You grant me my deepest desires, and I give you what in return? My undying gratitude? My life, my soul? I’ve read this story before, and it never ends well for the main character.” I laughed under my breath as I spoke. I had fancied myself quite the clever lad, always playing chess when everyone else was playing checkers.\n\nBut oh how I’d underestimated my opponent. With her word and every passing second, her spell over me grew stronger and stronger, and little did I know she was about to play her final hand. \n\n“No, of course not my child. Though your suspicion is not unwarranted. I require nothing from you, for you have already given me everything I could ever ask for. I only seek to liberate you from the internal hell you’ve been trapped in all your life, to give you the adventure you’ve craved from the moment you first saw that glimmer in the sky, knowing there was an entire universe out there, just waiting for the taking. You can have it, child. Everything and beyond. All you have to do is tell me what it is that you desire.”\n\nThe glint in her eye as she finished has been burned into my brain, though all the lost years and eons. There were so many signs, so many chances to turn away, to return to my tortured life. The air itself seemed to be chilled by her words, and her clipped and seductive accent only furthered the aura of mystery that clung to her. \n\nI studied my rescuer one last time. Any traces of the elderly beggar woman had been all but erased, replaced by an exotic and indescribable beauty. The pale wrinkled skin was now a smooth, shiny, and a perplexing shade of brown that I’d never seen before. Her hair, formerly a ghostly gray, was now a salt and peppered mixture of ginger and blonde that swirled around in an intricate braid. Her amber eyes were wide and practically lifted straight from the center of the earth. Everything about her invited you in, propelled you to know more.\n\nOf course, that had always been the plan, had it not?\n\nStill, the smallest piece of hope the war and my life hadn’t completely stomped out, yearned for the life she had spoken of. Yet it would be that same hope that would doom me to an eternity in the void. \n\n“Fine, you want to know what I really desire?” I spoke with a sincerity and confidence I’d not felt in many moons, not since the early days of the war. Her gaze was now firmly locked onto mine once more, and the sense of mental invasion crept over me yet again. \n\nShe had me, hook line and sinker. \n\n“I want to see everything. Every star, every planet, every moon, every galaxy. I want to travel to the furthest reaches of creation, see every sight there is to see. I want to know the answers to every question ever asked by mankind, to travel at speeds he has only ever dreamed of. But most of all, I want to live long enough to see it all. To see the future, to marvel in the glory of what mankind will become. I want to be… eternal.” \n\nMy famous last words.\n\nI’d all but forgotten the woman and our woodland surroundings as I spoke. My thoughts were already far behind the veil, beyond the stars and flying through the black void. My childlike imagination had been my only refuge, my oasis in the black desert. I looked over to the woman, who’s smiling expression was now deeply unnerving. Her toothy grin had spread from ear to ear, and her eyes were closed so tightly it looked as if they were about to roll back into her head. As soon as they opened once more, her eyes gleamed with such ferocious intensity they threatened to jump clean from her face. Her lips motioned as if she were about to speak, but the words that came out were almost inaudible and so my ears strained to pick them up.\n\n“Siempre Vive…”\n\nWe sat there, each locked in a deep gaze with the other. My shallow, labored breathing alongside her barely audible whispers were the only detectable sounds, the deafening sharp silence only intensifying as our standoff came to its sudden and anticlimactic end. She only spoke once more, with her final words all but seared into my memory.\n\n“I knew you were going to be special. Every man unlucky enough to walk the earth has craved the adventure you seek. But at long last, your search is over. So you desire, my child, so it shall be.”\n\nIn the same moment that she finished, a loud and bellowing yell echoed from somewhere in the cabin. It took several seconds to realize that the screaming was coming from me. All at once, an intense burning pain began spreading from my lower body. It was hot, hotter than any conflagration I’d ever witnessed, burning brighter than a thousand white hot suns. I screamed louder and louder, praying to a nonexistent god for the first time in over a decade. The woman didn’t move to help me as she’d done before. She only sat opposite me, with that crooked smile now deeply ingrained into her skin, her formerly amber eyes now pitch black. I could do nothing as tendrils of fog began to wrap their fingers around my subconscious, plummeting me backwards into the void. \n\n(story finished in comments)",

        "text": "I don't know how much longer I can sit here and pretend to be okay, I can barely keep a straight face. I should probably give some context, not that I can do much else than stay on my phone right now. I had to pick my little brother up on the way home from school as my mum works evenings. So, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary at first when I got home. The house was messy as usual, I didn't even see my mums phone under all her crafting supplies, she's probably one of the most disorganised organised people I know. I knew the routine, I'm sixteen feeling like I'm forty sometimes...Still, I made us both some food which really just was some tabbed left overs of pasta bake and chucking it in the microwave. Tommy, my brother, didn't like it much but I was tired and exams were wearing me down. \n\nPersonally dealing with a five year old wasn't the way I wanted to spend my evening but I can now say that that would be a dream compared to what was happening now. I got home at four, ate at five and planned on trying to settle Tommy but when he went to use the bathroom he spent way too long up there and I found him crying, I tried to settle him but it took over an hour and he just kept saying he saw something. And this was a kid who watched Chucky religiously. Honestly, seeing him so shaken almost made me not want to go upstairs at all. We moved in here about two months ago but we weren't new to the area, I hadn't heard any weird stories about the house so I never suspected anything. But I should have guessed something was wrong when my cat ran away and no matter how many times we brought him back he seemed distressed and ran away. \n\nBut I'm sitting in the living room with Tommy finally asleep on top of me. The TV was playing some rerun of a daytime show and I can barely think. I'm just trying to focus on writing this so sorry for all the rambling. I'm just scared that if I stop writing that it'll know that I know it's  there. All evening I have seen things out the corner of my eye, banging noises but I had assumed it was Tommy. But then I heard the groaning, gurgling, sorrowful moans and cries. It sounded so far away that I barely noticed it but at times it was also so loud. I don't know where it is. Or what it is. But I can hear it now. Slow, almost squeaking groans that occasionally utter my name. My mum should have been back by now but her phone went off earlier and she wouldn't leave without it. I'm starting to worry that she never managed to leave the house. \n\nThere's a rotten smell that I'll catch every now and then, taps on the window and the floorboards will creak. What the hell is in here with me. Everything in me is telling me to be silent and still. I'm too scared to move. \n\nUpdate...the TV just automatically turned off and now I'm sat in silence but that's not the worst part. Not even slightly. I sort of glanced up while keeping my bead down and there's something standing behind me. It sounds so far away but it's right behind me. I don't know what to do. I don't think it knows that I've seen it. It keeps calling my name but it doesn't sound right. I'm praying Tommy doesn't wake up. I know I can't run. What do I do? Just sit here...wait? The smell makes me want to gag, I'm on the verge of tears and it's hand is slowly reaching out toward my hair...",

        "text": "A few years ago, when I was feeling suicidal, I created a clone of myself to take my place after I killed myself because I knew my family would feel guilty and blame themselves and I didn’t want them to go through that.\n\nThe clone was exactly like me. He looked like me, acted like me and sounded like me. The only problem was, I was unable to make him age, get sick or die like a normal human but since this clone was me, I figured he’d surely think of a way to make himself look older as the years went by. \n\nBefore finally offing myself, I installed a camera in my clone, booked myself into a hotel and watched how he was around my family for a week. \n\nFor the first few days everything was going just as I wanted it to. It was like I was watching my everyday life through a screen. Nobody could tell the person they were interacting with was a clone.\n\nOn the fifth day I think it was though, the clone started acting differently. He was cheeky, insulting, just mean. On the sixth day, he started getting aggressive. He pushed my younger brother around and would break stuff. \n\nAt this point I knew I had to intervene. I quickly drove home as fast as I possibly could. When I arrived, I saw my family huddled in the corner, crying and my clone standing over them holding a knife in one hand and the head of our dog in another hand. \n\nI ran at him, tackled him to the floor and ordered my family to run. They looked at me, confused. I told them I’d explain everything later but they needed to get out of there as quickly as they could so my dad picked up my little brother, took my mom’s hand and ran out to the car and drove off. \n\nI knew there was no way of beating him so I took the knife and ran away too. I drove to the lab I created him in and brainstormed solutions on how I could defeat my immortal clone. After about an hour of pacing around the lab trying to think of something I finally thought of something. I didn’t like the idea but it was the only thing I could think of. \n\nFor the next few hours I built a device capable of stopping him and then drove to the nearest gun store and bought a pistol. When I reached my house again my clone was nowhere to be seen. I searched all over the neighborhood for him. It was only when I heard on the local radio “madman on a killing spree in the local Supermarket. Unable to be killed by police”  I knew where to find him. \n\nWhen I reached the supermarket there were cops everywhere. I put up my hood so they wouldn’t recognise me if they saw me and sneaked in one of the back entrances. My clone was in the center of the supermarket, holding a knife and covered in blood. There were dead bodies all over the floor and about 20 cops shooting at him. I saw a few try to run at him at once but he was too quick for them and slit their throats in the space of about 5 seconds. \n\nThe only way this was going to work is if I sneaked up behind him and put the device on the back of his neck. I used pillars in the supermarket as cover and the sound of the gunshots to cover the sound of my footsteps approaching him. When I finally got behind him, I turned on the device, put the pistol in his pocket and stuck the device on the back of his neck. This caused the both of us to pass out for a second. When I woke up, I was now in his body and he was in mine. I took the pistol and shot him in the head, killing my clone in my real body instantly. \n\nThe cost of killing myself was immortality.",

        "text": "It all really began when I was 7, it’s all a bit fuzzy to be honest, but I’ll do my best to give you a small recap and an idea of what’s happening to us here. Well, I say we, I really hope I’m not alone in this. \n\nSo, when I was 7, my Dad had tucked me into bed after shutting my curtains as there was a huge storm that night. He’d turned my nightlight on for me that I couldn’t sleep without. I loved it, it plugged into my wall next to the door across from where my bed is facing. It’s a bear shape and it has a blue light in it. My Dad kissed me in the cheek and said ‘sweet dreams cookie beans’ it was stupid, but it was our thing. \n\nI remember struggling to sleep that night, I never normally struggled so long as I had my night light (which I very creatively called Blue). I had tried to sleep for about an hour and it just wasn’t happening. I felt a shiver through my body and instantly felt eerie, worried. I always thought of myself as a brave girl, especially for my age, I’d never had to ask my Dad to check my wardrobe for monsters or get scared about ghosts. But that night, the feeling I had around me, terrified me. \n\nI started shouting my Dad after not being able to sleep and being scared. After the first couple of times of not answering me, I got more scared. I only usually had to shout for him once for him to come to me. So I began shouting louder, still sat on my bed with my purple fluffy blankets, just sat, shouting for my him. I started to realise the louder I was at shouting, the louder the thunderstorm outside was getting, and this was terrifying me even further. \nI jumped out of my bed and ran to my window to make sure my curtains were fully closed. Once I realised they were, I turned around to face my room, and fell to my rug, crying for my father. \n\nAll of a sudden, everything went silent. I thought I had gone deaf until I whispered ‘Suzie’ (my name) to make sure I could here. I was sobbing silently still sat on my floor. And then I heard what sounded like wind, but directly behind me. It made all my body shiver. I got up and sprinted out of my room to try and find my dad but he was nowhere to be seen. I heard the noise just once more behind me and then I woke up in my bed. \n\nMy Dad never believed me. It happened to me a couple of times a year and it would always be the same, still, it doesn’t make it any easier to have to go through. \n\nI’m 22 now, single, living on my own in a small one bedrooms flat after finishing university. \n\nLast night, something petrifying happened that hadn’t ever happened before, and I think I finally know what I’m dealing with. I just have no idea how to stop it. To be honest I don’t think it can be stopped. \n\nI was in my living room watching some boring shit on telly. Id just had a full pizza to myself so I was full and ready for bed. \nIt was around 11:30pm, I went to my room and tried to sleep. \nI knew it was going to happen when I heard the breeze. But like usual, I just wrapped my self up in my blankets and cried hoping it would stop like I do every other time. \nBut this time was different. \n\nStill wrapped up trying to protect myself, all I could hear was the wind had somehow started shouting. That’s the only way I can think to explain it. It was getting louder and louder so I just squeezed my eyes shut waiting for it to be over. \n\nAll of a sudden my blanket gets blown off me. I screamed and jumped out of bed putting my back against my wall to get as far away as I could for what I saw in front of me. \n\nIt was a black figure. It was copying every move I made, it was me. It had my shape, my hair, my everything that’s black figure could have. I realised this thing was my shadow, but I was still stuck on what it wanted from me. Why it was taunting me and how this was even possible. I only have a couple of answers. Unfortunately. \n\nThe shadows face started to stretch and I could see an endless hole where it’s mouth should be. I could feel my soul being ripped out of me as the wind took over my room. I couldn’t breathe and I could feel myself fading. \n\nBut then I thought about my Dad, I’m not ready to die, I don’t want him to have to live his last years without his only family. So with every bit of strength I could gather, I screamed from the top of my lungs, and I thought I would die by doing so. But it made my shadows stop. \n\nThen everything went silent again. And in the wind, I heard a small whisper saying ‘tomorrow’. \n\nTomorrow has come, and I don’t want to be alone tonight.",

I had always been a bit of a night owl, and I enjoyed the peaceful solitude that came with the late hours.\n\nBut tonight, something was different. As I sat at my desk, trying to focus on my work, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I kept glancing over my shoulder, expecting to see someone standing behind me, but there was no one there.\n\nThe feeling of being watched only grew stronger as the night went on. It was as if an unseen presence was lurking in every corner of the room, just beyond my field of vision.\n\nI tried to rationalize it away, telling myself that it was just the wind or the creaking of the old building. But deep down, I knew that something was wrong. \n\nThe darkness seemed to pulsate with an otherworldly energy, and I could feel the weight of the presence bearing down on me. I could barely bring myself to move, let alone focus on my work.\n\nI tried to ignore it, but the presence only grew stronger. It was as if it was feeding off of my fear and desperation.\n\nI knew I had to do something, but I was too afraid to confront it. In the end, it was the presence that made the first move.\n\nI woke up to find myself lying on the floor, my whole body trembling with fear. The presence was gone, but the memory of it would haunt me for the rest of my days.\n\nI never stayed home alone at night again, and I always made sure to keep the lights on. I didn't know what the presence was, or why it had chosen me, but I knew that I never wanted to experience it again.\n\nBut as the days went on, the presence only grew stronger. It seemed to be everywhere I went, a shadowy figure lurking just out of sight.\n\nI tried to ignore it, but it was impossible. The presence seemed to be toying with me, always just beyond my reach.\n\nI knew I had to do something, but I didn't know where to turn. I was alone, with no one to help me.\n\nAnd then, one night, the presence revealed itself. It was a creature, a monster unlike anything I had ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and its skin was slick and slimy.\n\nI ran, but I knew it was too late. The creature had found me, and it would never let me go.\n\nI don't know how long I ran, but eventually I collapsed, my body too weak to go on. The creature loomed over me, its breath hot on my face.\n\nAnd then, just as it was about to strike…everything went back to normal \n\nBut even now, as I sit here in the safety of my bed, I can still feel the presence lurking in the darkness, waiting to claim me....",

        "text": "When I was thirteen, my brother Elijah and I helped Grandpa down to the old oak, so that he could talk to the fairies for the last time. \n\nHe was losing the fight against old age - his hair was wispy and white as bone, skin liver-spotted and sallow. In previous years, he had insisted on making the journey alone every month, but his worsening arthritis had forced him to grudgingly accept our assistance. We held him up by his twig-thin arms, and made our way to the edge of our land, just before the crumbling stone wall that separated it from the woods beyond. \n\n“No further.” He said.  “They don’t like other folks getting too close.”\n\n“But-” \n\n“Remember what I told you, Elijah. No exceptions.” \n\nHe relented, and handed Grandpa his walking stick and a covered wicker-basket. We watched as he hobbled towards the ancient tree, and ducked into its hollow trunk. The shadows quickly obscured him from view. \n\nI frowned up at Elijah. Although I knew, rationally, that he was five years my senior, it was still frustrating that adults spoke to him about things which were kept secret from me. \n\n“What did Grandpa tell you?” \n\nHe sighed. “You’ll know when it's your turn to know, Ray.”\n\nI pouted. As far as cryptic responses went, that was pretty standard for our family. I’d long learned to stop expecting anyone to give actual answers, but I figured it was worth asking anyway. \n\nElijah smiled, and ruffled my hair. \n\n“Hey, did you know that trees are really only alive on the outside?” \n\n“Really?”\n\n“Mhmm. Eventually, all the dead wood inside gets eaten away by worms and fungi, and you get left with a hollow tree. They’re great homes for woodland animals.”\n\n“Like the fairies?” \n\n“Well, they aren’t really animals, but I suppose so.”\n\nWe waited in silence for a while. Grandpa had started speaking, his voice barely audible from within the tree, words indistinct. \n\n“Have you ever seen them?” I asked, finally. \n\n“Yeah… after Dad’s funeral. He left them an offering. I had to deliver it.” \n\n“What were they like?” \n\nHe considered for a moment. \n\n“Like stars. And bugs. And the morning dew. And autumn leaves and spring blossoms.” \n\nMy brow furrowed as my brain tried to piece together the disparate images in a way which made sense. Elijah chuckled. \n\n“It only makes sense once you actually see them.”\n\nWhen Grandpa emerged from the tree, about fifteen minutes later, he looked shaken. It looked as if he had aged another decade, if that was somehow possible for the centenarian. Elijah shared a worried look with me, but none of us commented on it. \n\n“Take care of this place well.” He whispered as we helped him back home. \n\nTwo weeks later, he passed away in his sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe funeral was small - he had not had many surviving friends or close family. He left most of his things, including the property, to Elijah, who also became my legal guardian. \n\nLife continued. I started and finished high school, made new friends and lost contact with old ones. Throughout it all, Elijah visited the tree every month without fail, much as Grandpa had done. \n\nAs I grew older, my belief in anything supernatural had begun to wane, and by the time I moved away for college I had pretty much convinced myself that the whole thing was just some weird family tradition.\n\nShortly after the start of summer break, Elijah asked me to house-sit for a couple of weeks while he was away on some important business trip. \n\n“Oh- and remember, you’ll need to go visit the fairies on the new moon - on the twenty-ninth. Okay?”\n\nI rolled my eyes. “Sure thing.”\n\n“No. Ray, I’m serious.” He held my gaze for a few seconds, then sighed. “Look - even if you think it's silly. Please, just humour me?”\n\n“Alright. I will.” I said, with greater sincerity. “What do I have to do?”\n\n“It's June… bring some gooseberries, strawberries and currants. Make sure they’re organic and fresh - you can get some from the farmers’ market on saturdays. Put a couple handfuls of each into a woven basket - you can find them in the shed - and leave it inside their tree. Then wait until they accept the offering, and leave. Okay?”\n\n“Cool.”\n\nElijah smiled, and squeezed my shoulder. \n\n“If you need anything, don’t hesitate to contact me. Don’t do anything dangerous. See you later.”\n\nAnd with that, I was left on my own in the house. \n\nMy stay was mostly uneventful. The peace and quiet allowed me to blitz through my summer assignments within the first week, and I spent the rest of my time catching up on sleep and reading. The place felt just as warm and homey as it had in my childhood, but was tinged with a nostalgic sadness. I hadn’t known my parents very well, but I had been close with my grandparents, and to me this house was inextricably linked with them. \n\nI decided I may as well follow through with Elijah’s instructions. While I may not have personally believed it, the strange ritual had clearly been important to Elijah and to Grandpa. So when the twenty-ninth came, I went to the edge of the property with my basket of summer berries in hand. They weren’t from the farmers’ market, but I reckoned they'd be alright. It's not like anything was going to happen anyways. \n\nYet despite my convictions, I could not help but feel some slight apprehension as I stood before that old oak. It had been raining for the last few days, and clusters of toadstools surrounded its gnarled base. They were massive, some caps larger than my hand, and looked like something out of a picture book; bright red, with white spots and a slender white stalk. Even though I was no mycologist, I could tell these were probably poisonous, and took care to avoid touching them as I entered the hollow trunk of the ancient tree. \n\nThree things hit me immediately. The first was the darkness. It was like a switch had been thrown. The opening was visible behind me, but the light seemed to hover on the threshold, refusing to enter the space beyond. The second was the silence - all sounds from outside faded to nothing as I entered, leaving me suddenly alone with the blood rushing through my ears and my breathing, which suddenly seemed too loud. The third was the air, which was damp and smelled of life, like a forest after a rainstorm.\n\nI took a few tentative steps forwards - the space seemed surprisingly large - and placed the basket down. Now what? Elijah had told me to wait for the offering to be accepted, but-\n\nA thousand tiny lights appeared in the darkness around me. I was reminded of pictures of remote places at night where, in the absence of light pollution, stars crowded the sky. I let out an audible gasp. \n\nIn fascination and disbelief, I watched as the lights - the fairies - swarmed around me. Their forms were mercurial, at times like glowing insects, at others more like orbs of light, or like tiny radiant flowers. I looked on for a moment, enraptured, as they flew around the inside of the tree, examining me as well as the basket. \n\nBut something was wrong. The movement of the lights became frantic, agitated, and some began to blink on and off rapidly. Suddenly the whole display seemed less magical and more threatening. \n\n*This will not do.*\n\nThe words sprang into my mind directly, and angrily buzzed around inside my skull. I took a few involuntary steps back, and clutched my head. \n\n“What’s wrong with it?” \n\n*Was no instruction given to you? It was agreed that the offering was to be without contamination.* \n\n“Contamination, what are you on about? Are you really that fussy about it being organic?”\n\n*Furthermore, your attitude leaves much to be desired. Consider yourself fortunate that we are merciful. We shall take only something physical as our retribution.* \n\n“No, you aren’t taking anything.” I turned to make my exit, only to find it blocked by a wall of flickering lights. My heart began to pound in my chest.\n\n*The agreement was clear. Any infraction on the part of either party will result in immediate, swift retribution on part of the other, with escalating severity for each subsequent infraction.* \n\n“W-what is that supposed to mean? I-I don’t know about any agreement.”\n\n*Laws apply whether you know them or not. Do not attempt to obstruct our justice, or we will take more than just your fingernail.* \n\n“M-my fingernail? What the fuck!”\n\nIf I had been concerned before, I was in full on panic mode now. Wasn’t fingernail removal a form of torture? I doubt they cared. \n\nIn hindsight, it was extremely stupid of me to try to run. They had made their warning clear. But I panicked, and my animal brain defaulted to a flight response. \n\nI didn’t get very far. The fairies swarmed me like a cloud of wasps, except with far more coordination and efficiency. There was a sharp pain in my left hand. A large group of the creatures were working in unison, and had pulled out my pinky fingernail. I think I must have screamed, but it was drowned out by the horrific ringing that filled my mind. \n\n*You could have made this so much easier.*  \n\nAnd then the fairies kept pulling, and pulling, as I writhed and tried to crawl away in agony, until there was a sickeningly wet pop, accompanied by the sound of tearing flesh. I became aware of blood running down my hand, then the pressure in my head became too much, and everything went dark. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. That was it. The story of how one tiny mistake cost me a finger. \n\nDespite the fact that I felt it getting ripped off, the wound was actually pretty clean and neat, and had stopped bleeding by the time I woke up. I guess they didn’t want to accidentally take more than they were due. If I look on the bright side, I guess everything could be taken as a learning experience. \n\nI have no clue how I’m going to explain this whole thing to Elijah in a way that doesn’t end with him beating himself up over the fact that he didn’t instruct me properly - I’ve a feeling that even if he had, my disbelief would have still resulted in me messing something up. \n\nI wonder what they took from Grandpa - and I have no doubt that they did, given the way he looked after his final visit with them. I have a horrible feeling that it was something much worse than just a finger. Perhaps I’ll never know, but I do still wonder. Has Elijah ever gotten on their bad side? I’ll have to ask him. \n\nBe careful around fairies, folks.",

I suppose you might not yet realise. You could reset tomorrow. It could happen on New Year’s Eve, 2034. Who knows?\n\nOver the festive period, I couldn’t stop thinking about New Year’s Eve, 1999. I remembered being terrified of those bullies, just like the little girl. If I had been courageous enough to intervene, I wouldn’t have faced the karmic retribution of a time-loop.\n\nI am still in I-3, and, since my previous post, I was sure to make note of the internet stranger’s contact details, lest the Glassy-Eyed Man should, once again, reduce my new friend to a smouldering carcass.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked.\n\n“Harold Langley,” The man answered.\n\nHarold still wouldn’t tell me how he knew about such corrupted things as Eleven Shrines and spiritual forces. He told me that I already had everything I needed. I knew to go back to the Hawthorne house between 11pm and midnight on New Year’s Eve. *Any* New Year’s Eve would do, in fact.\n\n“Well, I could simply wait to be reset to 1999. Then, I could stop the boys from *ever* locking Pippa in the house,” I suggested.\n\nHarold shook his head. “Even if you were to return to the past and drag the children *miles* away from the Hawthorne house, the Shrine would still entrap them at 11pm on that fateful New Year’s Eve, 1999. Remember, they’re already there. The house exists outside of time. Much like your *own* loop, no matter where they might travel, their bodies would still reset to that house at 11pm. They can only be freed from *within* the Eleven Shrine.”\n\n“Sending me back to 1999 is a convoluted way of sending a message,” I grumbled.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she’s doing, Jake,” Harold gently assured me. “Pippa is calling for help from an ungodly realm, and that has incurred an abnormality in time.”\n\nAfter a long discussion, I could no longer escape the fact that Harold knew far more about this topic than me. I’d spent millennia searching for an answer, and I finally had one.\n\nI just couldn’t *accept* it.\n\nIn truth, I simply didn’t want to go anywhere near the Hawthorne house. It imbued me with unspeakable thoughts. Every time I walked past it, I felt *evilness* surge through me. And I know that every child in my neighbourhood felt the same way. The Hawthornes had died decades before our time, but we knew that something was deeply wrong with the building they’d left behind. The house felt like a living, unfeeling thing. It was crooked. Out-of-place. *Ill-intentioned.*\n\nNew Year’s Eve, 2022. The Hawthorne house was exactly as I remembered it, though the neighbourhood was certainly much livelier. There were no ‘Missing’ posters, and the roads were littered with revellers, preparing for the new year that I had spent *ceaseless* centuries attempting to reach.\n\n10:41pm.\n\nNineteen minutes until I would reset, *unless the Glassy-Eyed man finds and ends me.* If Harold were correct, my only salvation would be to enter the Hawthorne house. At 11 o’clock in the evening, the Shrine would open.\n\nThere’s something much more frightening about seeing a haunted house in the real world. I have never minded eerie buildings in photographs or films, but the Hawthorne house is the most terrifying place I have ever visited.\n\nI gently walked from the moss-covered gate to the fatigued front door, which was painted a long-faded blue. In the front yard, there was an unlabelled stone cross, submerged in overgrown, withered grass blades. There were three storeys to the neglected building. Dark chasms lay behind the glassy panes, and the attic had a misted oval window. I felt a piercing pang of horror in my chest at the sight of a black shape moving behind the glass.\n\nOther than a ‘Private Property’ sign on the front gate, there was nothing to ward away intruders. There was no barricade across the rotting front door, and it was unlocked, so it creakily inched open with a light push. Perhaps the mere *sight* of the horrid place was enough to deter most people from trespassing. I wished that I could have the same luxury.\n\nAs I entered the Hawthorne house, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and lit the dismal place with my torch, revealing a hallway that led onto a ginormous staircase. There was an open doorway on the left-hand side of the hallway, and it led onto the lounge. I strolled into the dusty, asbestos-riddled death-trap. In the living area, there was a sofa which had been partially-devoured by vermin, but I collapsed onto it and waited.\n\n11pm.\n\nMy heart stopped. I wasn’t fading away. I was still in the present. *No. This isn’t the present*, I reminded myself. *The Hawthorne house exists outside of time.* Nevertheless, my phone’s lock screen displayed 23:00, which was good enough for me. I wasn’t resetting. That was the important thing. Before I could wrap my head around that, however, I noticed something.\n\nThe walls were groaning.\n\nChest undulating in terror, I leapt to my feet. The whining foundations of the house seemed to lament my presence. I took a look at the world outside of the mucky lounge windows. My dimly-lit neighbourhood was rapidly vanishing from view. Within seconds, everything beyond the exterior of the house was black. The bridge to the physical realm was gone.\n\nThough time was a foreign concept in that shrine to evil, I still felt that it shouldn’t be wasted. I had no idea what happened to the children, and I had no idea what was about to happen to *me*. I needed to find them. Then, I could focus on finding a way to re-open the bridge and escape.\n\n“I don’t know how to exit an Eleven Shrine,” Harold had quietly admitted to me. “Time works differently in there. I think it only opens a bridge to our world when it *wants* to do so. So, I suppose you have to give it something that it wants more than Pippa and those boys.”\n\nThose words rung in my head. I found myself meandering in the living room of that lost house. There was a large frame above the fireplace. Using my phone light, I studied the unnerving canvas that loomed above me. It was a painting of the Hawthorne house in its bygone glory days. I did not recognise the three people standing in front of the house, but I assumed it had to be the Hawthorne family. The mother and father were prim-and-proper. They must have lived in the 1940s, judging by their fashion, but I wasn’t really looking at them. I was looking at their boy.\n\nHe was a skeletal thing. His flesh seemed to cling tightly to the outline of his skull. The indignant expression on his face was communicated through joyless eyes and thin lips. He had a complexion that was almost wholly white. And that, strangely, gave the jubilant expressions on his parents’ faces a *sinister* undertone. Why were they so happy? Their son appeared half-dead. Needless to say, the painting absolutely horrified me, but *everything* in that house horrified me.\n\nThe swirling, nightmarish colours of the artwork felt like a fever dream. In the pristine oval window at the top of the painted house, there was movement. *The paint was actually moving.* Unlike the movement I’d seen in the real-life oval window, these painted shapes were crystal-clear. Pippa and the three bullies. Their mouths were agape, much like the man in *The Scream*, and they were huddling together, ferociously banging their tiny fists on the window.\n\nAs if that weren’t horrifying enough, there was more movement in the picture.\n\nThe painted mother turned around and started strolling along the path, heading towards the house. The son was decaying before my very eyes. His painted form seemed to be crumbling. Yet, the father smiled, and the mother continued walking towards the house.\n\nShe reached the front door.\n\nThumping followed.\n\nAnd I do not simply mean that I saw the painted mother thump the painted door. There was a thumping *sound* on the real-life door, which was in the hallway behind me. A bloodcurdling screech followed. It was a woman, I suppose, but her voice no longer sounded human. There was a guttural, distorted quality to it.\n\n“DON’T TAKE MY CHILD FROM ME!”\n\nI had no desire to hang around and find out what she meant. I sprinted from the living room to the hallway, praying the front door would hold, and I hauled my body up the rotting stairs, two at a time. Plunging into the darkness, I prepared for the door to fly from its hinges.\n\nThe thing for which I did *not* prepare was to suddenly find myself standing on a well-lit, refurbished landing. The Hawthorne house had morphed into a lavish home. From the top of the staircase, I turned to face the downstairs hallway. The banging on the front door had ceased, and it opened to reveal the mother. She was an ordinary person, not a frightening apparition. I realised I had wandered through a portal in time. I would say my initial guess had been accurate. It seemed to be a snapshot of the 1940s.\n\n“Jonathan, tell Bert that dinner will be ready in half an hour,” The mother shouted.\n\n“He’s not in here, Sarah,” Jonathan replied.\n\nThe father’s ghost startled me, though the couple seemed much jollier in this memory. He strolled straight through my body and walked down the stairs.\n\n“Well, I told the boy that he could only play until I finish taking down the laundry,” Sarah huffed.\n\n“He was with the Dalton boys across the road,” Jonathan said, now striding across the downstairs hallway. “I shall fetch him.”\n\nThe ghosts of the parents evaporated, and the house transported to a different moment in time. There was crying from a room farther down the landing. As I walked towards it, I noticed more frames on the walls. They were less macabre than the portrait I’d seen in the living room. There were three paintings of the individual Hawthorne family members.\n\nSeeing an ajar door on the left side of the landing, I peered through the slight opening. The sobbing mother was sitting at her dressing table, which faced away from the doorway. I could only see the back of her body. The father was holding her shoulders and futilely striving to console her.\n\n“I cannot live without him, Jonathan,” She wailed. “A mother *cannot* live without her baby!”\n\n“You shan’t have to do that,” Jonathan promised. “I have found a way to return his soul to us. Francis acquired some books. There are rituals that can help, but they come with a price, so-“\n\n“- Any price,” Sarah coldly interrupted.\n\n“And what of the boys who murdered our child?” Jonathan asked.\n\n“Death would be too merciful,” She said.\n\n“I agree. From my readings, I have learned ways in which we could make them suffer. If we could transform this house into unhallowed ground, we could ensnare their souls and eternally trap them here. They would become part of the building’s woodwork. We would have to build an Eleven Shrine on the eve of the New Year. There might be consequences for others who step foot on this land, but it-”\n\n“- Do it,” Sarah icily whispered.\n\nThe world washed away again. I saw brief flashes of the parents in their bedroom. They were drawing bloody patterns on the walls. I heard sourceless screams. Cries of anguish from who I only assume must have been the children who murdered Bert.\n\nThe jigsaw pieces were sliding together. The souls of Bert’s killers were embedded in the Hawthorne house. Sarah and Jonathan had succeeded, but had they also managed to resurrect their child? I shuddered, remembering the ghastly painting of a withering Bert in the living room. Something told me that a happily-ever-after hadn’t been on the cards for the fractured family.\n\nThe lights extinguished. The fresh decor aged in seconds, returning the Hawthorne house to the present. Well, I suppose I wasn’t really experiencing *any* sort of time period.\n\nEverything faded away, except for one thing.\n\nOne *person*.\n\nThe mother.\n\nShe was still sitting at her dressing table, facing away from the doorway. Her vanity mirror was cracked and coated in filth. I couldn’t see her reflection. Her clothes were dusty and tattered. Her once-beautiful blonde hair was withered, and she was stroking it with a hairbrush. Her strokes were so vicious that clumps of hair were ripping from her head. *No fucking way. I’m not going in there.*\n\nI attempted to cautiously back away from the door, but floorboards betrayed me. They moaned beneath my weight. *Fuck.*\n\nThe hair-brushing abruptly stopped.\n\nThe old, rickety vanity stool squeaked as the mother adjusted herself. I expected her to twist her entire body around to face me, but she didn’t. Instead, she simply twisted her head.\n\nShe twisted beyond breaking point.\n\nShe twisted her head *one-hundred-and-eighty degrees*.\n\nWhat was even ghastlier, however, was the face which gazed upon me. It was decomposing. Maggots swam through the cavities in the mother’s flesh. Her lipless mouth opened, revealing rotten teeth. She did not smile as she had in the painting.\n\n“WHERE IS MY SON?” Her half-human voice cried.\n\nTo protect itself, my haunted brain had detached from reality. So, when the bedroom door slammed shut, I was relieved and petrified in equal measure. I was relieved to be free of the mother’s ghoulish gaze, but I was petrified of what I would face next.\n\nRemembering why I had come to the Hawthorne house, I resolved to keep searching for Pippa and the boys. I didn’t know what kind of demonic spectre I’d just seen in the bedroom, and I didn’t *want* to know.\n\nStanding in the upstairs hallway, desperately trying to catch my breath, I became aware of a squelching sound. I cast my phone torch onto the wall behind me. A black liquid of unknown composition had scrawled three direful words:\n\n*FATHER IS HOME.*\n\nMoving my torch onto the paintings, I saw Bert and Sarah in their portraits. The third painting, on the other hand, was merely a blank canvas. Jonathan had left his portrait. I heard the front door open and slam shut. Loud footsteps moved with immense speed and purpose, clunking up the stairs.\n\nCrying in utterly primal fear, I ran towards the far end of the landing. I opened the final door on the left, hearing floorboards groan beneath the weight of some hulking, monstrous entity. For a split second, before I stepped through the open doorway, I caught a glimpse of something in the glow of my phone light.\n\nThe father was far taller and wider than he had appeared in the flashbacks. His gargantuan, ghostly form could barely squeeze through the upstairs corridor. His decomposing face was much like that of his wife, but his eyes were bloody spheres in his sockets.\n\nI slammed the door behind me and locked it. There was a cacophony of fist-pounding on the door. The father said nothing. His fury spoke far louder than words. I found myself in a second bedroom. Bert’s bedroom. Heart still not slowing, the frights did not cease.\n\n“Jake,” A disembodied girl’s voice hissed.\n\nI froze.\n\n“It’s Pippa,” She continued. “We’re in the hideaway. We’ve been here for months.”\n\n“Where’s the hideaway?” I asked.\n\nThe banging on the bedroom door finally quietened. Pippa whispered again.\n\n“Behind the wardrobe,” She said. “Hurry! I think they heard me…”\n\nI found the wardrobe on the left-hand wall and started to push it to the side. It was surprisingly light. Once it was a few feet to the right, a small opening was revealed in the wall behind it. I couldn’t see anything inside the darkened doorway, but I had to press forwards.\n\nI used my phone to light the way, and I found myself ascending a small set of stairs. *Of course. The attic with the oval window.* I tentatively clambered up the staircase, keeping my eyes and ears keenly peeled for anything untoward. When I reached the top, I stretched my hand towards the door handle before me.\n\nCreaking.\n\nAn icy breath skirted across my left ear. Something was standing on the step behind me.\n\n“They murdered him,” A voice groaned.\n\nI didn’t need to turn my head. I knew it was the mother. Quivering, I lightly pressed the standby button to switch off the screen. On the dark, glassy surface of my phone, I saw the walking corpse of the half-decayed mother standing just behind me. Her gaunt face was illuminated by my torch light.\n\nI screamed in terror, but I was quickly silenced by a gnarled, bony hand that clasped over my mouth. That only made me scream *louder*.\n\nI shook the creature off me, whirled around, and she was gone. Too frightened to spend another minute in this house of nightmares, I proceeded to repeatedly slam my shoulder into the attic door.\n\nFinally, it gave way.\n\nI cast the phone light into the attic, expecting to be met with emptiness, but I turned to the right to find myself looking upon four malnourished children, who were shivering beneath the oval window. The world outside remained an endless void, but that was besides the point. *I’d done it.* I’d found the girl who had been trapping me in the loop for thousands of years. It hadn’t been a fruitless endeavour.\n\nThe children were crying incessantly.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” Pippa said. “I was just so scared. Can you help us to leave this place?”\n\n“We didn’t mean to do it,” One of the boys whimpered.\n\n“The voices made us lock her in here,” Another boy added.\n\nThe third boy simply nodded, seemingly too traumatised to speak.\n\n“Okay,” I eventually managed to say. “Do any of you know something that could help us to escape?”\n\nTheir eyes widened.\n\n“You don’t… know how to free us?” One of the boys shakily asked.\n\nI didn’t respond. My mind was whirring. I thought about everything Harold had told me. Then, I realised I didn’t need his help. I needed the help of the people who had created the Shrine.\n\n“Sarah!” I screamed. “Jonathan!”\n\n“What are you doing?” Pippa asked, horrified. “We need to get *away* from them!”\n\nBefore I could reply, the wall at the far end of the attic started to ripple. Like swimmers coming to the surface of a pool, the dreadful mother and father seeped through the torn wallpaper. The children screeched, but I stood my ground, keeping the torch light on the horrible abominations that were striding towards us.\n\n“Is your son buried in the front garden?” I asked.\n\nNo reply. The emotionless demons looked upon me with their awful eyes.\n\n“If you create a bridge back to the real world, I could return him to you,” I said. “That’s what you want, isn’t it?”\n\nThe mother started to walk towards me, and I trembled in immobilising terror.\n\n“He should be here with us,” She wheezed.\n\n“Open the bridge,” I repeated. “You can’t leave the house, can you? I can return his bones to you. I can give you peace. But you *must* return all of us to our rightful places on our rightful timelines.”\n\nThe ghouls stared for a long time. The only sound in that haunted room was the blubbering of the four children who were hiding behind me. I received my answer in the form of light pouring into the room. Not light from my phone. *Light from the oval window.*\n\nI and the children turned to face the real world. Fireworks filled the sky. As we watched, with teary eyes, the children dissipated. The outside world, in turn, rapidly changed. The sun rose and set thousands of times in the matter of seconds. Years were passing.\n\nWhen the earth eventually slowed, I knew it was 2022 again.\n\n“Return our son,” The father wheezed.\n\nWhen I turned to face them, the terrifying entities were gone. I sprinted down the stairs from the attic, bounded across Bert’s bedroom, flung my panicked body along the hallway, and started to sprint down the main staircase. Gliding across the hallway towards the open door, I prepared to taste freedom.\n\nScorching agony.\n\nHorrified, I found myself engulfed in darkness, before being thrown onto the floor of the hallway. I bellowed in pain, feeling a searing sensation across my skin.\n\n“No…” I whined in horror.\n\n*The Glassy-Eyed Man.*\n\nHe was standing on the front porch, obstructing what seemed to be the only exit from this house of hellish tricks. He was little more than a shadow, filling the doorway with his black form and white pinpricks.\n\n“I fixed it,” I yelled. “The loop is over!”\n\nNo response from the inhuman entity. No movement. I checked the time on my phone. 11:02pm.\n\n“It’s after 11 o’clock, and I’ve not reset!” I explained, exasperatedly. “THE LOOP IS OVER!”\n\nAfter an eternal moment, the shadow faded into the blackness. The glassy pinpricks merged with the night sky, joining a canopy of twinkling stars. My strained heart finally loosened. Gingerly, I attempted to leave the house. I took a step onto the porch.\n\nNothing stopped me.\n\nI hurried into the front yard and tore at the grass with my bare hands. Dirt under my half-broken nails, I quickly dug my way to the cluster of bones that the Hawthorne parents had buried. Why did they not keep the bones in the house? Did they ever manage to resurrect their son? Why were their souls trapped in the Eleven Shrine with their son’s murderers?\n\nSo many unanswered questions.\n\nI delicately and respectfully placed the pile of bones inside the main hallway, quickly exiting the Hawthorne house. As I tiptoed backwards, keeping my eye on the open front door, I saw a bony hand stretch across the wooden floor and drag Bert’s remnants out of view.\n\nAs I passed through the gate, the door to the Hawthorne house swung shut. That was fifteen minutes ago, and I hope, beyond all hope, to never re-open that terrible chapter of my life.\n\nAt this very moment, I find myself sitting on the curb, typing my update, and staring vacantly at swarms of party-goers. They’re blissfully unaware of the horrors lurking in the abhorrent building just behind me.\n\n11:22pm.\n\nI’ve never lived beyond 11pm on December 31st, 2022. That must be a promising sign. I’m free, surely? At 11pm, I didn’t wake up in 1999. Pippa must have released me, but has the Hawthorne house? Has the Glassy-Eyed Man?\n\nI suppose I’ll never have a definite answer. I’ll always wince in terror at the sight of cavernous crevices. I’ll always look for those white eyes. I cannot conquer the unknown, but that’s not my battle. After thousands of torturous years, I would simply settle for seeing January 1st, 2023.\n\nAt midnight, let’s hope I manage to post a comment.",

The radio tower had given us a good view of the Death Cap Mountains, and I had seen what looked like a small town between us and the nearest peak. Despite Max having been trapped here for months, he had never been this far down the road.\n\n“There was one couple that went as far as the town and returned to the visitor’s center,” he told Naomi and me. “They said there were horrible things there, things that looked like regular American people but weren’t. They had a dog with them, and when they returned, the dog was gone. Apparently the people in the town had stabbed it to death and eaten it raw right in front of them, and it was only that distraction that allowed them to get away at all. They owed their life to that dog.”\n\n“So where’d they end up going?” I asked, curious. \n\n“Well, they waited for night and tried returning, said they planned on driving through the town as fast as they could when those things were sleeping, if indeed they slept at night. I never saw or heard from them again.” Max shrugged, his worn button-up shirt looking loose on his body. He had apparently lost a lot of weight since first being trapped here. “Maybe they made it out. People seem to think there’s an exit down the road, somewhere in the Death Cap Mountains, but I don’t know where they heard that or how they figured it out, seeing as no one has ever come back as far as I know.”\n\n“Maybe it has something to do with that white light feeling we were getting earlier,” Naomi said. “I swear I could *see* your thoughts and memories, Jason. Some of yours too, Max. And there was a feeling of immense peace and weightlessness, as if I knew everything would be all right, even despite all these abominations and our probable impending deaths at the hand of some cultists.” As if speaking it had brought it to life, I got hit with another blast of that energy. My vision turned white, and I heard a voice like rushing water booming through my head. It didn’t speak in English or in any other human language, but I understood it completely in my heart nonetheless. To this day, I don’t know if it was an angel or God or just some hallucination, but it was one of the most profound and bizarre experiences of my life.\n\n“You will find solace at the clearing at the end,” it said, shaking my entire body. I saw huge white auras around Max and Naomi that vibrated, and as their eyes widened in shock, I realized they could feel it too. Luckily we had reached the bottom of the tower, or all three of us might have tumbled down the stairs in surprise.\n\n“There is an evil here, the one who brings the dead lights and infects those he stole, but your purity is stronger. Don’t be afraid, even though not all of you will survive this. This is what the path has been leading to- the path of your entire lives, and not just these roads of dust and dirt.” As the voice faded, the white light started to fade too, and my vision returned to normal. I felt a deep thrumming throughout my body, like a high-tension wire that got jolted with way too much electricity. But it felt good, somehow powerful and right, as if I had been waiting for that contact my whole life and never realized how much I was missing.\n\nThere was another aspect to it, though- a feeling that an impending evil was waiting for me, knew exactly where I was and was expecting me. I could almost *see* the face of that evil, in a psychic sense, like it was standing right behind me and staring into my mind. And yet I knew I had no choice but to continue to approach it. It was too late to turn back, so all we could do was brace ourselves for what was to come.\n\nAs we approached the car, I knew something was wrong. It looked cock-eyed, and I saw that the tires had all been slashed, the front windshield and driver’s side window had been smashed, and the steering wheel had literally been ripped out of its column. It hung out the driver’s window, attached by a mess of wires, like a severed limb hanging on by a single tendon. All three of us stopped in our tracks, mouths open and eyes wide as we surveyed the damage. As usual, Max recovered first and spoke in his direct way.\n\n“Well, I guess we’re walking,” he said, a bit of amusement in his voice. “It was inevitable anyway. It will take longer and we certainly won’t be able to carry as much as we could in the car, but it might also be quieter and allow us more time to see upcoming dangers.” I sighed in exasperation.\n\n“The ammo and all the water seem like the heaviest parts,” I said. “We need to decide how much we can split up between the three of us, and whether there are fresh streams of water we can trust. If there are, we can carry much less water and just refill the bottles on the way. If the beginning of the mountain is only twenty miles or so, which is what it looked like from the top of the tower, I think we could do that in a day, assuming we can walk about three miles an hour with all the equipment and guns.”\n\n“And that means,” Naomi said, her face gaining a sour and unhappy expression, “we need to camp out. It’s already eleven AM now, and by the time we get all this crap together it will probably be noon. We have no tent, no sleeping bags, nothing…”\n\n“Ah, you kids,” Max said, laughing. “You don’t need a damned tent and sleeping bag just to sleep outside. Our ancestors survived for hundreds of thousands of years without tents and sleeping bags. Plus, it looks like there is some sort of town up ahead, about halfway to the mountains. We could just stop there for the night.” So that was our plan. We ended up filling canvas bags and backpacks in the trunk with as many provisions as we could carry and headed out.\n\nThe sun shone brightly without a cloud in the sky and the wind blew lightly. I had a light jacket on but had to remove it, due to all the ammo, food and water weighing me down, not to mention the gun I carried. After a few hours of walking along the road, the forests started to open up and high cliffs surrounded us on both sides. There were streams running across the road now too, but someone had built wooden bridges by splitting trees in half and nailing them together. They reminded me of Lincoln logs but seemed incredibly sturdy.\n\nWe began to walk up a massive hill and after reaching the top, saw a breath-taking sight. Purple-hued mountains rose tens of thousands of feet in the air behind a small town that followed along the dirt street. Huge Victorian houses of all colors rose on both sides, and a massive castle stood at the end. Smoke billowed from chimneys up and down the street. It reminded me of vacation towns I had seen in the Berkshires, though these mountains looked much higher than even those of New Hampshire or Vermont. Near their peaks, clouds blended and obscured the snowy tips, even though where we stood there wasn’t a single cloud in the sky and the weather was far too warm for any snow.\n\nWe had only a few hours left of sunlight, so began to walk faster to reach the town before dark. Regardless of whether we liked it or not, we had to stop and sleep eventually.\n\nWithin an hour, we were in sight of the first massive Victorian houses. Now that I was closer, I could see small shops interspersed between the houses. They looked quaint with huge glass windows and clean, freshly-swept sidewalks lining all of it. Compared to the horrors we had seen earlier, this town looked entirely out of place. Yet still I saw no people.\n\nAs we walked into the town, I saw movement in the windows of the shops and the houses. It looked like each building had multiple people moving throughout, but to me they only appeared as fleeting silhouettes. I checked to make sure the safety on my gun was off and that a round was loaded in the chamber.\n\n“You guys got your game face on?” Max asked us, and we both nodded. Just then, an old, hunched-over man with a black suit and a fedora stepped out of the nearest shop, which was labeled “Harvey’s Meats.”\n\n“Good afternoon, travelers!” he said with what sounded like a deep Maine accent. “You must have come far to see our beautiful little haven. Can I interest you in some fresh food?” He languidly opened his hand and gestured to the shop behind him. Through the windows, I could see human corpses slit down the middle, hung on racks like deer. A few decapitated heads were visible on the serving trays behind the counter. At a few small, round tables, people ate voraciously, smearing blood on their faces as they stripped the rare meat away from the bone. I saw them chewing on thighs, arms and even the cheeks of dead men, women and children. Their eyes were wide and staring, and they ate as if they had been starved for years, throwing the bones in the corner as they finished and grabbing another heap of human meat from the table as soon as they were done.\n\n“Get back, old man,” Max said, raising his AR-15. I also raised my shotgun and aimed at his center mass, ready for any tricks. “Naomi, keep watch behind us.” I saw Naomi turn to make sure no one came from our backs as Max and I kept a close eye on this strange man and his shop of cannibals.\n\n“My name is Harvey,” he said, pretending to not even hear Max’s threat. He inched closer to us, using a cane to support most of his weight. He couldn’t have been more than four and a half feet tall, a diminutive and slow figure, but still my instincts told me we were all in danger. “I am the Mayor of our little town, which we call Death Cap’s Haven. No one passes through here without my permission, I’m afraid.” He looked genuinely sorry at this, his smile turning into a slight frown. \n\n“Old man, where have all these people come from?” Max asked, taking the leadership role as he did naturally as a former federal agent. “How did you build this town here? And where is the way back?”\n\n“Ah, questions, questions, questions,” Harvey said, giving us a wicked grin but answering none of them. In the silence, I could hear the smacking of lips and the rending of flesh as the cannibals in the shop continued to eat faster and faster. “I have a question of my own, if you don’t mind. *Are you ready to die?*” With those words, all the silhouettes I had seen in the houses and shops began moving faster, and people started pouring out of the doors. The cannibals, with blood still dripping down their chins and staining their shirts, burst forward from the shops. The townspeople stood arranged behind Harvey in a triangular shape, with him as the head, with every one of the hundreds of eyes on us.\n\n“We have company behind us, too,” Naomi said, and I turned and saw black-clad cultists coming out of the woods. There were dozens of monks, dressed to look similar to Buddhist monks but with jet black robes instead of orange. She raised her gun at them but didn’t fire. All the newcomers formed a semi-circle around us, staring with hatred and anger at our presence.\n\n“Well, it looks like the party’s all here!” Harvey said, laughing a dry, dusty laugh that chilled me to the bone. The only possible exit we had was the door to the meat shop, which was only blocked by a couple of people. But going backward or forwards was, for now, impossible.\n\nMax looked at me, motioned to the door, and nodded. Grabbing Naomi’s arm, I pulled her and we all began to run as fast as we could towards the door to Harvey’s meats. Max raised the gun, firing at a blood-stained cannibal who lunged at us. I raised my Mossberg and shot another cannibal who was sprinting towards Naomi with a rabid look on his blood-covered face.\n\nThe smell that hit us when we entered the shop was overwhelming, indescribably horrible. I have never smelled anything like it, and I never hope to. It smelled like a combination of meat that has been left out to rot for weeks, feces, thyme, rosemary, mint and cooking beef. I gagged a bit in my throat as Max and I dragged a table in front of the door, turning it on its side and wedging it under the door handle.\n\n“Oh God, the smell!” Naomi said, gagging slightly. The townspeople began to smash at the large, plate-glass windows that lined the front of the shop. We saw that the shop continued behind the counter and all three of us ran at once, with Max taking the rear and keeping his gun pointed backwards. I heard a smashing sound and then the tread of dozens of heavy feet.\n\nIn the back of the shop was a kitchen area lined with cages on one side. In them, naked, shivering children looked at me, still alive but looking half-starved. Their cages were lined with feces and urine, and they yelled at us for help as we ran past. A back door opened out onto the forest, and Naomi smashed through it as fast as she could. I ran behind her, grateful to be out of the stench of the area, but the townspeople caught up with Max and began to grab him. He started shooting, sending three of them to the ground, and I stopped and joined his fire. The buckshot totally obliterated the face of the fourth, and I grabbed Max’s arm and pulled him away from the hungry, grasping arms of the townsfolk.\n\nWe began to run blindly into the woods, through thorns and brambles, getting slapped in the face by branches and twigs and yet never slowing. The sun began to set, and before I knew it, we were lost in the woods, far from any trail and with no idea where the road lay. \n\n“Stop, guys,” I said, panting, my lungs burning. I doubled over, trying to catch my breath. “We lost them, but I think we’re also lost ourselves.”\n\n“Oh God,” Naomi said, “did you see those kids in the cages? I think they’re planning on eating them!”\n\n“I guess it’s their form of veal,” Max said dryly. Naomi looked at him, horrified.\n\n“Is that your idea of a joke? We need to get those kids out of there!” she responded.\n\n“Look, Naomi,” I said, “we don’t even know how to get ourselves out of here. I don’t even know where the hell we are. We need to find our way back to the road. So much for stopping to rest in the town.” My stomach rumbled. We all decided to sit down and eat some chips and protein bars, chug a couple bottles of water, and try to come up with a plan.\n\nAs we ate in silence, we began to hear singing and humming coming from a couple miles off. It sounded like the townspeople had gathered on the road and began to celebrate.\n\nWe followed the noises back towards the town, using our flashlights to navigate the thick brush. By the time we ended up near the road, we were behind a large Victorian house, much farther into the town than we had originally started. It had a large porch in the back. I tried the door but it was locked, so Max came up and kicked it in with one booted foot. \n\nThe house had paintings all over the walls- paintings of the monsters we had seen, paintings of the children in cages, paintings of cannibals ripping the flesh off of people’s bones, paintings of people being burned alive or sacrificed in rituals. They covered nearly every square inch of the walls.\n\n“Do you like my work?” a voice said from behind us. I turned and saw a young-looking Asian man in the black monk’s robes. “I created this place, thousands of years ago, and have lived here ever since. Yes, it changes with the times, but I haven’t. Not really. Deep down, I have *always been the same.*” As he finished talking, his voice deepened and stretched out, sounding demonic and lower than a human voice could ever go.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“My name is Mara,” he said, returning to his pleasant, impassively low voice, “and I created this road and kept it connected to your world to feed my children. Back in ancient India, I made a pact with all the demons of the Hell-world that they could use me, work through me, and in exchange I would get immense powers and be nearly immortal. They told me I had to commit the unspeakable acts first, to kill my mother and my father, to kill a saint, to delude thousands of people and draw them with me. I did all of it, and made many more sacrifices than that, and strengthened myself through meditation and gained the seven psychic powers of a great being. Now I maintain this road with my mind- and the minds of all the demons, who still thrive here. They are fed well, for I connect this road to many parts of the world and allow newcomers in.” Max pointed his AR-15 at Mara and tried to bully him into cooperation.\n\n“How about you let us all the fuck out of here before I shoot you in the head, Mara?” he said. Mara smiled, and Max screamed, dropping the gun. I could see smoke rising from his fingers.\n\n“It burned me!” Max screamed, looking down at his gun in horror.\n\n“I suggest you two also put down your weapons,” Mara said. “I am not trying to hurt you, at least not yet.” With a look at Max’s black, scalded fingertips, I did so, and Naomi followed my lead. I doubted a gun could hurt this being anyway, if he was as powerful as he said.\n\n“Now, how about we all sit down and have a little chat?” he said, pointing to the kitchen where a long table surrounded by chairs waited for us. We all moved cautiously to the table and sat down.\n\n“So I am a reasonable man,” Mara said, pulling out the chair at the head of the table and sitting down himself. “I will, of course, let you all out. All I want in exchange is your souls.” I laughed.\n\n“Our souls?” I said, feeling hysterical. “Is that even a real thing? And if it is, how can someone live without it?”\n\n“Oh, yes, it is very real,” Mara said, smiling wide and showing far too many teeth. It looked like his teeth had been filed to sharp points. “That white light you have likely felt, that is the soul of the road interacting with your souls, strengthening it and intermingling with it. The power here is much greater than on your side of the veil. But you can certainly live without your souls, will even be alive and healthy even without them. You can leave here and live full lives. Then when you die, you will be eternally bound to this road, and to me.”\n\n“Yeah, I think we are good with that deal,” Naomi said, standing up quickly. “An eternity of what, monsters and psychotics, in exchange for a few decades of life? How much sense does that even make? I would rather die than be here forever.” Mara smiled at this, as if to say, indeed, you will. “Guys, let’s get out of here.” Mara nodded and continued sitting as the rest of us rose.\n\n“If you leave here, I cannot protect you,” Mara said. “The demons have a mind of their own, after all. They use my power, and I use theirs, but they will rip you apart even if I say no. And I will not be saying no. You can live full lives- the exit to your world is only a few miles up ahead, through the Western gate. Or you can die terribly here, like all who disobey me.”\n\nAs he finished speaking, the feeling of white light overwhelmed me again, and I tried to focus on it. Somehow, deep down, my subconscious knew how to harness it, to use it. I concentrated it and pushed it out through my chest, shoving my hands forward. A ball of blinding lightning soared through the air and hit Mara square in the neck. His impassive, cold smile quickly fled his face and he fell back, screaming.\n\n“Run!” I said, and we all went out the front door. Mara’s house was near the end of the town, the penultimate building behind a huge stone castle. The castle dwarfed all the houses and shops of the town, seeming to stand twenty stories tall with turrets and spires rising from all sides of it. The massive oak doors at the front were wide open. As I ran through them, I heard Max scream. Turning, I saw the marble-white skin of a woman walking on all fours. Her mouth was ripped open from ear to ear, and she crab-walked backwards at an insanely fast pace before leaping and biting deeply into Max’s shoulder. With no guns, I couldn’t react in time. I pulled my pocket knife out and tried stabbing at her but three more of the abominations ran out from the bushes, one biting into my leg. I screamed and fell. Naomi ran over, kicked her in the face and pulled me up, and we ran into the castle as fast as we could, slamming the heavy oak doors behind us.\n\nFrom the window in the door. I saw Max writhing on the ground, surrounded on all sides now as dozens of these corpse-like women emerged from the forest. They seemed to only want to watch him and ensure he stayed in place. Then from down the road, I heard the roar of an engine. A tow truck approached and the black-haired corpse women scattered. An average-looking middle-aged white man got out, a large belly bouncing under his uniform which read “Death’s Cap Towing Service.” He pulled out the hook from the back of his truck, whistling to himself as he did so, and walked over to Max.\n\nMax’s eyes grew wide, and I saw it all happen in slow motion. The tow truck driver slammed the hook into his neck, causing a waterfall of blood to feed the thirsty dirt below. Max began choking on his own blood as the tow truck driver, still whistling, got back in his truck. He pulled the winch in, pulling Max off the ground. Max twitched and writhed on the cable, each gasp causing fresh torrents of blood to pour down his white shirt, and the man started the engine and pulled off.\n\n“Holy shit,” Naomi said, sounding like she was having a panic attack. “Holy shit, did that just really happen?” I nodded, tears streaming down my face.\n\n“We’re not getting out of here alive, are we?” I asked. “We must be outnumbered a thousand to one, at least.” Naomi shook her head.\n\n“We have to, Jason,” she said. “I don’t want to die here, choking on my own blood or being eaten by cannibals.” I nodded.\n\nWe traveled into the castle, finding it laden with tapestries and heavy mahogany tables. Opening up my phone, I found that the signal from the radio tower still reached us here, and that the wifi still worked, connected somehow back to our world just as the road did. We found rest in the corner of the large downstairs chamber, folding up tablecloths and rugs for a make-shift bed, and ate what little food we had left as I wrote this all down.\n\nTomorrow, I will either get out of here or die trying. I am not selling my soul for my life, no matter how horrible the death I face in this nightmarish place may be. The feeling of the white light has left me, and instead despair and emptiness have replaced it, but I still remember the voice that told me my entire life has been leading up to this. If that’s true, then maybe I was meant to kill Mara somehow, that my life was designed to end this great evil. But in the end, I really just want to go home.",
