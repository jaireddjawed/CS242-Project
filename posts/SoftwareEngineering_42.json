My main question is what Associate's Degree would I want in order to set me up for success? Or if something extremely relevant is not offered what are the main courses I need to make sure I enroll in?\nApologies if this is a topic already covered, I did some searching and couldn't come up with any results.\n\n\nP.S.

        "text": "I'm a typical, 2nd degree seeking story. Got my first degree in accounting, got hired full-time, I loathe my job, and am looking to switch to software engineering. \n\nI LOVE all things CS/SFE, and have been super into computing and programming since I was young. Though I originally wanted to pursue a CS degree in college , a bunch of people (who didn't really know much about CS at the time) convinced me to go business/accounting instead because \"it's a more reliable job\". I now know that's a load of bs. \n\nAnyways, the company I work for pays for any accredited college courses/degrees 100%, so I enrolled at Arizona State University's Ira A Fulton online program in software engineering. I know ASU has a pretty good rep when it comes to engineering and this online program is actually ABET accredited, so I figured it can't be a bad way to go. I'm just finishing up my Intro to Java course right now and enjoyed it. Sometimes it can feel like drinking from a fire-hose, but I've noticed as long as I practice and just fool around in my IDE, I pick up the concepts pretty quick (next up is calculus 1,2, &amp; 3 and linear algebra :/). \n\nThe one thing I'm worried about, however, is the recruiting opportunities that on-campus students get. I live in Southern California, and ASU is about a 4-hour drive away from where I live. I feel like I may miss out on a lot of job and career service opportunities that on-campus students get. If I do things like drive to ASU during their engineering career fairs and other events like that, do you think that will mitigate the other missed opportunities? \n\nHas anyone done online schooling for either CS/SFE and had any luck getting job offers?\n\nThanks!\n",

I've applying to entry-level positions for close to a year now.  My question is whats the difficulty in changing from COBOL to a more modern developer position? Does it become more detrimental to my career the longer I stay in this position?  Are recruiters looking at my resume and disregard it my experience as worthless to the position?  ",

        "text": "I am looking for some advice.  I graduated in 2015 with a mechanical engineering degree.  I did not have a good GPA (2.7).  My performance was by no means an indicator of my ability.  I never was really interested in mechanical engineering and instead of switching degrees or biting down and doing my best I coasted by.  I have been working and am doing well.  I am valued and keep getting more responsibility.  During this time I have wrote some applications that run on our factory floor.  They save the operators time by not having to fill out paperwork.  In addition the data is stored in a database so we can analyze it easily without having to dig through stacks of papers.  While doing this I have found that writing software comes fairly easy to me and that I enjoy it.  \n\nNow that I have given you more background information than you need I will get to my question.  I want to go back to school for software engineering.  The program at the local university has almost all of the courses available online.  I have a family and need to keep working so online courses are a necessity.  My employer is willing to help but they are looking for me to take a few classes not to pursue a degree.  I don't think I will be able to pay out of pocket once my employer stops contributing.  I want the formal education to gain knowledge that I will not get while teaching myself.  I want the degree because my first trip to school is a real skid mark on the underpants of my ego.  Any ideas on how I can pay for the schooling?  I am in the United States if that matters.",

        "text": "So to have a real shot at somewhere Google, you realistically need to have top marks from somewhere like Stanford.  I _know_ there are exceptions, but if you want even a 50-50 chance that's probably what it takes.  So if you went to Stanford at 18, you made the grades, and left with a bachelors at 22 (I would assume an elite school like that wouldn't be something you could easily test out of courses or get credit from Community college, so it's going to take all 4 years), then you get hired by Google with no delays.\n\nSo...your career is just 12 years long?  In this best case scenario for the most elite student available?  They do pay like $130k, but after paying rent, that's not going to let most people retire.  It's basic arithmetic.  You'd be lucky to save 30k a year from a 130k salary after all the costs associated with living and working in California (very high rents, income taxes, almost everything will cost more.  Even Newegg charges tax, lol.).\n\nOh, and the degree cost ~$240,000 + interest.  12 years at 130k does not justify that.\n\nI read all this articles about rampant age discrimination, and I believe it's real, I just don't quite see how the math works out.  How can these industries stop hiring people when they are 35 if they also demand bachelors and Master's degrees?  I see job postings all the time that generally want a Masters _and_ 5-10 years experience.  \n\nI mean, if you weren't born with top 5 or 10% parents, you might have to join the military.  Say, again, everything goes smoothly, and you do 4 years, then get a Master's on a GI bill.  You don't enter the workforce until 28.  There's just no way if they stop hiring at 35 you will even be able to pay back the time and investment you made.  \n\nYou'd think there wouldn't be enough candidates if policies are this discriminatory.  If this is really a \"hot\" field, there would have to be a lot more jobs.",

The class I'm currently in is principles of Java and I've had a pretty easy time grasping all of the previous concepts that have been thrown at me. However, we just started covering constructors, mutators, creating classes/methods, and it is a A LOT of info to take in and really grasp in this amount of time. I feel like I'm \"sort of\" getting it but not fully understanding it. My question is, with things like this, do you end up learning these more so on the job or is it imperative to memorize and master everything in school? I just want to make sure that I can be the best software engineer that I can be. Thanks for any advice!",
