For example, /r/SeattleWA buying ads on /r/Seattle, circumventing the ban on any mention of their sub there.

        "text": "In other words, since Reddit's inception, upvotes and downvotes have been used as an agree/disagree button, not as a relevant/irrelevant buttons - which is their intended use. No matter the effort of users to tell others that the upvote/downvote is not an agree/disagree button, people still misuse them.\n\nImagine if in the dictionary, the word \"X\" meant \"happy\", but people used it to mean \"sad\". The definition would evolve to accommodate that, and the dictionary will switch its definition to sad; see for example the word \"literally\", which now doesn't mean literally anymore, but as a phrase of exaggeration. \n\nWhich brings up the question, why does Reddit not rework voting slightly, and make voting become an agreement measurement of a sort? It's a billion times easier than convincing the entire, constantly evolving user base to switch to the \"correct\" definition of voting.\n\n**I had a couple of ideas come up, and I will try to summarize them through bullet points:**\n\n* Make upvotes/downvotes an agree/disagree, but remove the negative number if the downvotes overpower the upvotes - add color coding, for example, a very downvoted comment could be \"500 points\" in red font, but a very upvoted comment could be \"500 points\" in blue font\n\n* Add a new button, akin to reporting, that tags the comment as \"irrelevant/spam\". If there's too many of these on a certain comment, then it gets hidden, as if it were to be downvoted in current Reddit.\n\n* Show percentages of upvotes/downvotes like the old RES feature\n\n**How would this help Reddit?**\n\n* Stops unpopular opinions from being sent to the depths of hell where no one can see them or discuss them\n\n* Highlights the opinion of the majority even further, now people can stop with the \"it's as if Reddit is made of different individuals\" excuse\n\nSorry if it's hard to read, it's kind of hard to put the idea into words for me.

Probably in the thousands, even though I've been browsing reddit for less than a year. No matter what people say on this site you can count on someone who disagrees with them acting like they said something entirely different. If they get called out on it they often say \"you *implied* it\". But why the tendency to argue people's perceived implications and not what they actually wrote down?\n\nWhat's stranger still is these strawman comments, no matter what the subject matter, are usually heavily upvoted and if the \"victim\" calls them out they're met with a torrent of downvotes. So for whatever reason it's considered an accepted part of reddit culture.\n\nI've seen this happen in every sort of discussion you can imagine, from deep philosophy to something petty like the quality of a hamburger.\n\n**But why?** If someone behaved like this in a real life discussion they'd be torn a new one.

My position had been that there were a ton; others, however, argued that the presence of such comments had been falsely inflated by me, to make a point.\n\nThe problem with that, though, is that people arguing that position repeatedly brought up the fact that yes, the comments in question aren't nearly as visible if sorted by \"top\" or \"best\" (the difference between which I honestly don't get, but that's another question for another time). Sorted by top, the \"bad\" comments go away, yes. But:\n\nAm I the only one here insane enough to be reading threads sorted by \"old\"? \n\nI prefer looking at the \"shape\" of a thread, its arc from idea to idea. So I like to see the comments (and their responses) in the order they showed up. But if Reddit as an entity is overwhelmingly sorting (and therefore receiving, \"interpreting\") its content differently, I honestly feel it's my responsibility to at least keep this in mind before getting myself in trouble again with broad, sweeping statements about a thread's \"theme\" or whatever. So:\n\n**How do you read a comment thread? Do you sort by top and just skim the best bits? Do you use sorting options to truly make certain branches of the conversation \"irrelevant\" in your eyes?**\n\nI ask because I think this is one of those times when if everyone else is doing something one way, I kinda need to too.",

        "text": "&gt; it's been clear as day that the mods in the larger subs are abusing their positions to further their political views.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Moderators are biased toward X.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; If it was about/made by X it would be allowed.\n\nI have seen those kind of quote quite often and in a lot of different context.\n\nThe thing with all those quotes is that they all represent the perception that user have of their moderation team.\n\nI've talked a bit about that recently on /r/leagueoflegends and since I pulled some numbers to help support my point and theories.\n\n----\n\nUsers lack the data to correctly assess the performance and impartiality of their moderation team.\n\nMost of the moderation actions are completely invisible to the users either because they happen too early in the post life for most to notice or because they just don't leave any evidence that they were performed (approving a post for example).\n\nTherefore users judge moderation team on the action they do notice which are non representative of the totality of what the moderators do.\n\nMore importantly users tend to notice more easily actions performed on post they care about. This lead to the idea that this topic they care about is being unfairly targeted because they didn't notice past removal of others topic under the same rules in the past. This then lead of accusation of bias that reinforce itself via self confirmation bias.\n\n----\n\nTo give you an idea, the actions that are the most likely to be noticed are front page removal, because a lot of users will have seen the post and there will be a decent amount of people involved in it.\n\nRemoval of front page post on /r/leagueoflegends are recorded in the meta subreddit /r/leagueofmeta in posts that look like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/59igdm/anything_faker_does_or_says_gets_on_the_front_page/), they include title, reason for removal and content of the post.\n\nNow a bit of numbers:\n\nIn April 2016 on /r/leagueoflegends I performed a total of 17 971 mod actions. Out of those 6 618 were post removals.\n\nDuring the same period I made 61 threads on /r/LeagueOfMeta for as much front page removal.\n\nSo ~0.9% of the threads I removed were front page thread.\n\nAnd that's only for post removals. If you count post approvals (1 837), comment removals (7 125) and comment approvals (1 414), that percentage drop to: ~0.36%\n\nSo the most noticeable of my mod actions for the month of April represented a negligible percentage of what I did that month.\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* User don't have enough data to correctly evaluate moderators actions. Mainly because they have no knowledge of those actions.\n* Moderators, the users opinions of you is forged on a very small amount of things compared to what you do.",

Meanwhile at the bottom, we have one that generates only 12 views per upvote (it goes against this sub rules to discuss it though). Next from the bottom up, /r/cats, which more than doubles that ratio: 27 p/u.\n\nIt's also interesting to see the huge difference in views/upvotes for subs like /r/gonewild vs /r/gonewildcurvy: 126 vs 58.\n\nCheck the chart and analysis out, I'll be happy to add more details and stats if you'd like me too.",

He tells me that Reddit is a heavily censored place that is largely moderated by  r/ShitRedditSays and Correct the Record. \n\nHis statement sounded like longhand for \"Reddit is ran by SJWs and Hillary Clinton\", so I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory. Not only that, I have some real doubts about the accuracy of anything Voat says about Reddit. *However*, I know very little about Reddit's moderating and administrating in general, so it's hard to back up my beliefs. \n\n**My main questions:**\n\nHow true is the statement that many SRS mods are administrators for Reddit? \n\nWould an SRS administration have a strong impact on the discourse of Reddit if this happened to be true?\n\nWhere did the claim that SRS is running Reddit come from? I have a guess, but I want to know if this idea is common among other subs that aren't related to he who shall not be named. \n\nExtra credit: I tried explaining to my friend that subs like fatpeoplehate broke Reddit's anti harassment rules.

        "text": "**I know this may sound like a paranoid conspiracy theory but please bear with me for a moment.** \n\n/r/Syriancivilwar is a 3 year old sub focusing on the Syrian Civl War and its spillover into other countries. With nearly 45,000 subscribers, it is the largest discussion place on the internet for the war. It has been mentioned in multiple news outlets. \n\n\n8 months ago, Colonel Steve Warren, the official spokesman for the American led anti-ISIS coalition, [made a single comment on the sub. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/45wxpq/either_russian_or_syrian_airforce_bombed_two/d00z2mp) The comment is a response to a user accusing either the U.S., rebels, or Turkey for airstrikes on rebel hospitals which has the been a habit of the Russian air force in Syria. A few months later, Colonel Warren had a IAMA [on reddit using the same account.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4i5r4h/hey_reddit_im_col_steve_warren_spokesman_for/) The Colonel's post proves that the sub is at least on the radar of the U.S. government.  \n\nA little over a year ago, Russia intervened in Syria on the behalf of the Syrian Government which the U.S. is opposed to. Around this time, the sub took a permanent swing from an anti-regime and pro-rebel userbase to an overwhelmingly pro-government, pro-Russia, and anti-U.S. culture. During this time period, there has been a proliferation of accounts that are less than a year old and post exclusively in /r/SCW and related subs. These posters always have a pro-Russia/regime bias.\n\n\nI noticed something strange today when I checked the new tab on /r/SCW. The exact same pro-government map was posted one minute apart by two accounts both less than 8 months old. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/YnGobv6.png\n\nIt is possible that both users saw the same map somewhere and decided to submit it at the same time. But their post is part of a post that was made in the sub 3 days ago showing the same pro-government maps. \nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/57o6ex/saa_progress_in_aleppo_and_damascus_20132016/\n\n\nThis is where I started looking at accounts of some of the posters. As I said before, the sub took a very pro-Russia, pro-regime stance after the Russian intervention a year ago. The frontpage of /r/SCW is usually filled with pro-government links and tweets. The only anti-regime or pro-opposition links on the sub can be found on the new tab and get downvoted to the abyss. \n\n\nLooking at the accounts of the frontpage of /r/SyrianCivilWar, you will see many young accounts. **23 out of the top 25 post were made by accounts younger than year old. Some of these accounts are only 2 days or a month old.**\n\n\nOf course these could be people with old accounts posting on the sub with new accounts but considering the dramatic shift of the sub's culture within a year as well as the fact that most of the top posters do not have an account older than the Russian intervention, it leads me to believe that there may be an effort to swing the narrative of the war in favor of Russia/Regime. The Russian government has been known in the past to use internet trolls to change the course of discussions. \n\n\nOf course I could be a tinfoil hat wearing anti-Russia/regime user upset about the sub's direction but I think this needs at least some discussion.

        "text": "One can find on reddit a lot of subreddits which have a large subscriber base but quite low levels of content and/or regular users. For example:\n\n* /r/math has 150,000 subscribers, maybe 30 of which submit or comment with any regularity. Compare to the similarly-sized /r/CasualConversation.\n\n* /r/Poetry: 50k subs and it takes a week for /new to roll over to a new page. Compare to /r/hillaryclinton, with half the subscribers but a post every 3 minutes and 600 comments on a 3-hour-old post as of this write-up.\n\n* /r/philosophy: 8 million subs, almost no content. The average subscriber posts once every 3.5 millennia. /r/GetMotivated has 3 to 4 times the posting rate.\n\nSo what's going on? What makes certain subs so much more desolate despite being populated with similar numbers of users?\n\nI think the answer is that many of the users of these less-active subreddits don't actually have an interest in the focus of the sub. A user who stumbles across /r/Poetry is reasonably likely to think \"I'm the kind of interesting, sophisticated person who would subscribe to /r/Poetry,\" even if they'll never actually participate in the analysis of  Margaret Atwood that shows up on their front page - the subscription is a symbol of status, of being the interesting person that people like to believe they all are. Conversely, few redditors will subscribe to /r/hillaryclinton unless they actually care about her candidacy.\n\nThis is evidenced by looking at the top posts on these subreddits. What attracts universal approval from /r/math's subscriber base? [This.](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) A comic, a news article that can be understood from the headline (even though it's wrong and the comments tear into it), an image post, an image post, a joke image post, a news article that can be understood from the headline. Hardly top-notch content, despite the fact that in-depth articles, discussions, and analyses are posted daily.\n\nThis has some advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, at least these redditors are seeing content from subreddits that tend to be fairly high-quality, even if the engagement rate is rather low, and that can't hurt. On the other hand, the content that *does* get highly upvoted no longer correlates with what's actually good, only what's accessible, and can paint an inaccurate picture of the community at the usual levels of discussion and interaction.\n\nI'm curious to hear /r/TheoryOfReddit's thoughts: is this something which needs addressing? If so, how might it be dealt with?",

In the past 24-ish hours, three things happened: \n\nThe FBI today released a new batch of documents which are obviously very damaging for Hillary Clinton. It is alleged in an official interview with the FBI that Patrick Kennedy (who represents the State Dept) was pressuring the FBI to change the classification status of a document that was improperly accessed and used by Clinton. \n\nJulian Assange (head of Wikileaks, currently hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London) has claimed that \"a state actor\" severed his internet connection. The United States, The United Nations, and Ecuador met today to renegotiate the extradition treaty. Ecuador decided to continue protecting Julian Assange. To me, this might be indicative that Assange has something real, something big, and that for some reason the US government is desperate to shut him up. edit: I am now reading that it was an Ecuadorian state actor, not part of the US government.\n\nA video was released by an investigative journalist who got inside the Clinton camp. They showed that several of the violent events at Trump camps were planned and intentionally incited by people closely related to the Clinton campaign and the DNC. The video also gave some information as to illegal communication between the DNC, the Clinton Campaign, and Clinton-associated super PACs.\n\n/r/politics is silent. I've always been skeptical about the whole \"Clinton owns reddit\" explanation. Is there an alternative, besides \"/r/politics is left-wing?\" I mean, sure, I get that Clinton supporters aren't likely to upvote something that makes their candidate look bad, but you'd think you'd see something.",

        "text": "I've noticed, but never really thought about, how out of the blue certain subs can either get extremely popular with more upvotes and submissions on average, or suddenly die for a spell, and that these fluctuations could be related to (what I assume is) reddit's largest demographic, students, having to focus their energy elsewhere, or not at all, simultaneously.\n\nI've been out of school for over seven years now, so I'm not 100% on what the typical college semester looks like these days, but if I had to guess I'd wager that the die-outs occur when major tests are looming, such as mid-terms and finals, and the surges in activity take place mostly over breaks.  While I'm sure there is a general correlation with the academic year and reddit activity, it would be interesting to see which subs are affected most, or if any have an opposite reaction; for instance, more serious and research-type subs might see more activity as students utilize their resources.  Further, commenting could become more stressed or critical towards others when an important test is looming, and people trying to take a break from their work are venting their frustrations on the internet.\n\nWhat got me thinking about this, though, was how drastically some subs I frequent have shifted in the past month or two, and I imagined it had to do with a flux of new users that may happen to be college freshmen, away from home and with unfettered access to the internet for the first time in their lives.  Personally, I learned about reddit through college people, and I assume that's the story with most of us.  Anyway, several thousand new users are suddenly adding their opinions and perspectives to the pool every fall, and I wonder what kind of affect this has on reddit as a whole.  Take for instance r/showerthoughts:  Over the past month or so I've seen more reposts of questions asked many times over, and it would make sense to assume that this may be because there are a lot of new users who just haven't seen those older posts.\n\nThe idea is interesting to me, I'd love to be able to analyze this and draw a proper conclusion, but I have neither the resources nor the attention span to pull something like this off (would take at least a year, several for more reliable data because it could just be an election year thing), so I figured the least I could do was share the hypothesis and see if anyone else would like to run with it.",

In that instance, it has been widely accepted after the fact that a state actor was undertaking an aggressive disinformation campaign, both online and in the media.\n\n\n",

At any time of the day, you can find posts violating that premise on the very first page of the sub. Just glancing right now:\n\n* ELI5: Why do some of us sneeze almost always the same amount of times?\n\n* ELI5:I see people on Twitter selling food orders for really cheap. Example: $10 for $50 worth of food at Pizza places and paying through PayPal. How do they do this? Is it illegal?\n\n* ELI5: What is it that makes some TV shows look cheap?\n\nThere are more on the first page alone, but I just picked 3 of the most flagrant violations of the premise. Of course, *any* question can have an extraordinarily complex answer if you're willing to go that deep. But nothing about the phrasing of these questions would make someone think \"hey, this guy would appreciate it if I cite academic literature to support my point\". \n\n ELI5 basically is a \"repository for any question you may have\" despite claims to the contrary in their rules. But I actually like that. ELI5 is a total disaster at living up to its premise, but the hivemind adapted it to fulfill a need that reddit can't seem to meet: asking questions without too many restrictions. \n\nSo why can't reddit do it?

And rather than reducing participation, posting the rules increases the incidence rate of newcomer comments by 38.1% on average. In the experiment, newcomers are accounts making their first r/science comment in the last 6 months. The 20,385 newcomer comments were 29.7% of all comments in this period.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XHcfqbx.png\n\nThanks everyone, for encouraging my MIT PhD work with moderators to run field experiments of moderation practices with subreddit mods! ([Theory of Reddit post earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/456503/want_to_test_your_theories_of_moderation_lets/))!\n\nEven as I participate in [the conversation on r/science](https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/56h704/posting_rules_in_online_discussions_prevents/), I'll keep an eye out here and answer any questions you have. \n\nIf you want to **design a new experiment to test your moderation ideas**, I would love to talk.

        "text": "A few years back, some moderators started thinking, \"with all these misleading and hyped up titles we get sometimes, why don't we just require everyone to use the *original* title of an article?\"  While I can see how that seemed reasonable to people who didn't bother to think about it and don't understand the web or reddit, it's a toxic and destructive policy for nearly any reddit - yet more and more are jumping on the bandwagon because they see other reddits doing it.\n\nProblems:\n\n* Which is the \"original\" title?  Many web pages have one title in the title tag, and another title in big bold lettering at the top.  Many of them edit one or both titles after publication.  So there might be 4 or more options for the \"original\" title, and some of them may no longer be visible when a moderator looks many hours later.\n\n* Titles are written for a context.  Newspaper titles, youtube video titles, magazine titles, reddit titles - these are all different contexts.  The same title is often not most appropriate for all.  For example, newspaper titles strive for extreme brevity, but adding a few words can make something much clearer.\n\n* Furthermore, a subreddit often has a context all its own.  Redditors who are part of that community are more likely to know what it is about the piece they're submitting that relates most to the interests of the subreddit, and can indicate that in the submission title.\n\n* Original titles can be very hyped!  Many are deliberately written as clickbait.  A redditor can reword things to be less hyped.\n\n* Original titles may lack critical context.  For example, they may use acronyms they expect are obvious to the readers of their blog, but a reddit post would do better to expand the acronym.  Or a local publication may name a town or local place or locally known business or personality, but a reddit post intended for a national or worldwide audience would do better to add context about who or what that name refers to.\n\n* Sometimes, original titles are just bad.  Often a redditor does a better job summarizing the actual content of a post in a title they write.\n\n* Original titles are often very bland and don't convey that the content is interesting, even though it may be very interesting.  Reddit was deliberately designed to let submitters edit a tile so they can convey what's interesting about something, so that people skimming the title list will be able to pick out what they're likely to want to read.\n\nThere are a multitude of reasons why a redditor-edited submission title can be superior, sometimes very far superior, to the \"original\" title.  Yet more and more reddits have adopted blanket policies, no exception, of prohibiting that, rather than just saying they'll take down things the mods think are misleading or over-hyped.  They're dragging down the overall quality of reddit, inexorably further downwards, as well as frustrating and embittering many good submitters who've learned how to write good titles.\n\nCan we do anything to reverse this noxious and damaging trend?",

A lot of the subs I see it on have grown quite a lot lately and some sticky posts warning /r/all users but do it anyways.  It seems inevitable that the audience will broaden as subs grow.  This seems like a response to moderators not being happy with reports or not being happy with the type of discussion that is going on in the thread, which are both going to be things that happen as the community grows.  \n\nI've been banned several times from subs for going against the flow in posts.  It's always a perma ban too.  I understand moderators wanting to control the communication in their sub, but it's becoming quite common to see.  At what point is it right for a moderator to control what the community thinks?  We recently saw the no man's sky sub go through some trouble because the head mod was unhappy with how the game was received.",
