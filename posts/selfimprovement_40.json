The last 10 years (from 19 onwards) I have taken many backpacktrips all over the world, I even did some trips almost broke hitchhiking and camping. I met some really inspiring people and I would def say these trips made me the person I am today. \n\nBut offcourse the activities you do or don't and the overall way you spend your time on these trips varies alot and so does the level of self development.\n\nIn april 2022 I was still pretty hangup about a breakup the november before, alltho I was doing much much better then the months before. I started to think it would be good for me to take a trip. So I planned a month in Mexico. Offcourse to enjoy, but also for healing and self improvement.\n\nI planned to learn spanish, take surf lessons, do some yoga and spend time in nature. Alltho I had a real great trip, I didn't to any of those things lol. The moment I arrived at my hostel in CDMX I got dragged in the party scene by my fellow dormmates straight away.\n\nI really met amazing people and had a great time, and it did really help my healing, but I didn't do much self development lol.\n\nI'm planning a 3 week trip to Morocco now where again, I want to do some surfing, but alos hiking, mountainbiking and yoga. I quit drinking since jan 1st so it will also be a sober trip. Also I'd like to read some books during that trip for inspiration and overall self development.\n\nWhat are your favorite travel self improvement activities?",

My current situation/routine is actually one I am already quite proud of:  I wake up around 7 to get ready and walk the dog, and go the gym afterwards (about 5 to 6 times a week). After that I freshen up and usually have made a to-do list for the day. This can vary immensely from helping around the house to visiting a friend, but sometimes there's really nothing to do. On top of that I work about 25 hours a week. I'm trying to get some more hours, but they don't have any available as of now. \nWhile this *sounds* like a busy day: most days it really isn't. Work is often not until the evening/night, apart from the 2 or so days that I work during the day. Like I mentioned, the stuff on my daily to-do list can sometimes be basically none. I picked up journaling again recently, but that is not a timeconsuming thing. \nDoes anyone have some fun/productive ways to stay busy during the day?",

At 33 I want to become stronger mentally. \n\nOne thing I have is that I can not be alone for extended amounts of time without feeling down/depressed. Is this normal when you are a dad? Physically, I am overweight but I am clean and hygienic as I have an eating disorder I am currently working on beating.  I only mention this because I know your body being healthy contributes to your mental health.\n\nIf I get into an argument, I am the apologetic one that concedes (at times for example with my wife, I literally beg for my wifes forgiveness). I apologise to people for stuff they do, so say someone cuts me off on a path or walks into me, I am the one that apologises, to the point people will tell me I don't need to apologise. I have only just started becoming more assertive in that I will say no to peoples requests but I am usually there for people who aren't there for me/I don't ask for help from. \n\nI am not as respected as I would like and my wife's word is what goes when our adult child asks about things that are happening etc. I am very friendly, but I tend to not be able to keep friends for long or make them. I've always been against the whole \"manly\" type of man image, where you are silent because you don't cry/don't open up etc but I am quite the opposite.  \n\nPeoples moods around me affect me. I'm a people pleaser, someone who looks after people, but now finally, I am going to look after me. What are the best ways to go about this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help!",

She is very pretty, thin, and looks like a super model. It's only been a few months since school started and she already has every boy in the school chasing after her and tons of friends. Whenever we go out in public, guys come up asking for her number. Meanwhile, I went through all four years of school being a loner without friends and zero interest from boys. Some days I'll be thinking I look pretty good, but then I look at her and it makes me feel like shit. \n\nFor some more context --- my sister is a huggeeee girly girl. She's obsessed with make-up, gossip/drama, and anything pink. As for me, I'm a full blown tomboy. I have a buzz cut and I lift weights. Again, most of the time I think I look pretty good. But sometimes I wish my looks garnered me more attention from guys (most guys dont like women with shaved heads and are stronger than them). I've had a lot of people think I'm a lesbian/stud but I'm not. I don't want to wear make up and crop tops and shit like that, but sometimes I wonder if that would make people like me more. Idk.\n\nAnyway, does anyone have any advice on how I can stop comparing myself to her all the time and/or feel better about myself?",

Like a restaurant having to file bankruptcy or someone not getting something they were after.\n\nThis showed itself this past Christmas. I work for a medium-large sized company and as a little Christmas gift they decided to put together a little tiny booklet of homemade recipes that other managers had.\n\nAs soon as I got the email I felt really sick. I just got really emotional thinking about how they might have put so much effort into this and how (it seems to me) that no one was interested in. I don't understand it, as I did not contribute to the book or even care that much about it. Hell it's been almost two months and I haven't used it\n\nI don't understand why I'm so sensitive about stuff like this but I want to stop these feelings. Looking for any advice.",

My housing situation is in jeopardy. I’ve been so stressed that I started to think I was getting a cold because I felt fatigued, and felt generally unwell. My heart has been pounding at an almost constant RHR of 108 (your resting heart shouldn’t be over 100). My chest is filled with that pounding anxiety feeling. My jaw wants to clench. \nI’ve been laying in bed all day worrying and researching, and the thought of getting up and doing something else made me feel sick to my stomach. \n\nI just wanted to sit in my stress and research research research until I found some sort of comfort in my situations. \n\nSo my question is, how do I cope with stress, and focus on something else until I can start to fix these issues? How do I walk away from the internet, acknowledge I can’t do anything at the moment, and just stop worrying? I try deep breathing, getting up and doing something else, but I’m just pulled back into bed researching again…",

Literally none of the members of yearbook committee knew who I was. Just worked 4 hard years only for them to not even list my name. I was not a super popular kid in school, but i know I was at least recognizable among some of the other names.

I learned from psychology that children with authoritarian parents lack self esteem and I think that actually has sone merit considering my dad was hella strict on me.\n\nAnyways because of this person, I started to question why I am so attracted to people of the opposite sex. I tried to find reasons but I couldn’t actually think of any. I’m starting to think it is just human nature to find someone for happiness. I started to rethink the purpose of humanity and started to rethink the traditions of society. I would to believe that this is probably due to human ancestry and the way of survival back then. \n\nBesides this I started watching a lot of psychology videos and started to try and change myself, but then I realize I would just be living an inauthentic life as I would try and copy other people’s personality and not truly be me. \n\nI am at a point in life where I basically lost all direction in life and don’t really know how to get back to being myself and truly myself. I was thinking of just venting this all out and taking life easy from now on. \n\nThanks for listening to this long rant and if you like to you can leave advice in the comments.",

        "text": "Newsletters are a quick, simple way to get fresh ideas to your inbox easily and in a fun manner. However, they may not be the best thing for you if your life is oversaturated with self-improvement content and you need to start filing through the junk and figure out what is actually valuable (because a lot of it is just the same ideas: be more positive, meditate, etc.)\n\nThat being said, here are a few newsletters that help with self-improvement that I've found extremely beneficial. Don't subscribe to too many, just pick 1-3 to avoid clutter.\n\n1. The Daily Stoic Newsletter: Ryan Holiday has helped me so much through my own personal life and I find Stoicism and its ideas extremely helpful and fascinating. If you're looking to take control of your life in a simple manner, this newsletter is for you.\n\n2. The Breakthrough: Mark Manson provides crisp, straight-to-the-point thoughts on how we can become better humans every week. If you are a fan of Mark Manson and his counterintuitive yet effective approach, this is for you.\n\n3. The Socrates Project: Obviously I'm a little bit biased, because I'm the creator, but I truly believe that this newsletter has the power to help people not only better themselves, but others around them. If you like philosophy and food for thought to help you grow as a person, this is for you.\n\n4. 5-Bullet Friday: Tim Ferriss is one of those self-help titans who are actually very honest and down-to-earth. I love this newsletter for its style and I always learn something new or interesting. If you like to stay curious and build yourself in the process, this one is for you.\n\n5. 3-2-1 Thursday: James Clear's Atomic Habits was super impactful in my life and helped me navigate each day more clearly. His newsletter is extremely informative and provocative. If you're looking for an interactive, applicable approach to self-help, this is for you.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Morning Brew- I love this newsletter because it presents me the world's news, at my fingertips, in just a few minutes of reading. It reads like a newspaper, so you can always find what you need. If you liked to stay informed and updated about what's going on in the world, this is for you.\n\nThank you, and have a great day! (but do trust me on The Socrates Project lol)",

At the end of the day, after I've just finished the same thing I do everyday I just feel empty and I feel like I wasted my time. Mind you I spend a lot of time on my phone however this feeling is more apparent after socialising. It feels like the world is small, and that there's just a limit on everything. example: physics, I know there's a lot that I don't know but it feels like there isn't much left to know and that we have achieved all we can and it feels like that for everything.  The extent of my imagination is something sci-fi or avatar.\n\n\n\n It feels like all my problems go away when I socialise but the problem is I'm not particularly close with anyone and I normally just go out with a few friends once a month. Despite not considering them close friends and the feeling being mutual, I enjoy that time but at the end of the day when it ends I feel just empty. Are there any ways in preventing this feeling (other than drugs)",

        "text": "My typical self-improvement routine isn’t doing anything for me, but that’s fine because it never did anything for me in the first place. How many more years until it does? It’s been what, five, six years since I started this—surely it would have done something for me by now. It being a steady routine of exercise, meditation, journaling, reading, and I’m sure there’s something else I’m forgetting because of how ingrained into my life it is. Good hygiene, maybe that's it. Maintaining a clean and tidy environment. I try to get seven hours of sleep a night but the nightmares always intervene. I'm out of bed by 0510; earlier if I wake up earlier. No phone until 0700; the time inbetween is for exercising and meditation and getting ready and journaling and reading. I go to bed at 2200; I'd try to start sleeping earlier except living in a college dorm is barely conducive to my bedtime, and living elsewhere isn't an option.\n\nIt feels like I’ve read and tried everything that people recommend for self-improvement. Gratitude journaling, volunteering, dopamine detoxes, no social media, no internet, no electronics, cold showers, religion, subliminals, reality shifting, minimalism, breathing exercises, new hobbies, old hobbies, socializing, podcasts, new environments, therapy, medication, no caffeine (though I rarely touch caffeine; never other substances), audio journaling, affirmations, going on hikes on my own and with others and spending more time outside. Different diets and different vitamins and supplements. Trying to get a job and still trying without luck. Reaching out for help and never receiving anything that actually helps. Probably more; I don’t bother to keep track. Each for long enough that one would expect it to do something for me. I’ve certainly maintained my ‘core routine’ for long enough to expect some result. Discipline isn’t a problem. Forming a new habit isn’t a problem.\n\nI’m still the same miserable ball of depression that doesn’t enjoy anything. I don’t exist alongside reality; I live in this little space beside it, hardly interacting and hardly existing with whatever the real world is. I want to be real and I want to enjoy something and I want to stop being suicidal all the time. I just want something to change and I’m so tired of trying the same things again with no results and keeping up the same routine. Everybody else says it’s life changing, but where’s my improved life? Why can’t my mood improve? \n\n**I just want to know what I’m doing wrong and what I can change and how I can be alive again.** I’m so tired of dealing with this mood and this little body that’s in too much pain as I write this. My hands are about to give out and that’s fine because when don’t they. Who even knows how I’ll be able to get through college; at this point I sure don’t.",

I will get a random spark of motivation and delete all these apps that take up hours of my day, then within three to four days I find myself downloading them back. Lets be real, social media has its uses, many of my group chats for class group projects are on there and I use those apps to connect with friends in general. So even if I do delete them, I will 100% be redownloading them eventually and the cycle starts again. In fact, what's hilarious is I will delete the big ones like tiktok and ig but guess what, I'll start spending those hours I should have saved on facebook, whatsapp, and other apps I rarely used before. This might be turning into a rant, but my question to you guys is, how do I get in control! What I mean is, how can I, without deleting these apps, limit my usage of them to maybe 1 to 2 hours a day max so I could use my time better. How do you guys manage your social media use?\n\nSo far, I have tried adding time blockers via settings on iPhone, which always backfires because I'll be scrolling mindlessly until my limit and then just tap \"15 more minutes\" or \"ignore for the day.\" This lack of self control is weakening to me, and the funny thing is most of this \"wasted time\" is spent watching self improvement content, when I could actually be self improving...",

        "text": "{TW: Suicide/Suicidal Tendencies} \n\nHello. I am coming here to share a smidge of my story and my current situation.\n\n23m. I just got out of a relationship that was short lived, but boy oh boy does it hurt. My previous relationship was 4 years and I got broken up with because she wasn't happy with me anymore, and I didn't fulfill in what she wanted.\n\nI come from poverty, abusive parents, and a long string of mental health issues. I've attempted suicide twice, and have been hospitalized once for it. That was a while ago, but the tendencies and urges have surfaced back every now and then when life altering events occur. I have never really had a stable home, getting evicted all of the time, sleeping in cars, hotels, friends/family, etc. But now all of that is gone. I have nobody. \n\nEvery relationship I've been in throughout my life, I have learned something positive, and applied it to the next. I was always working on myself. I have done relatively well in terms of my very short temper, I almost never have outbursts  anymore. But, I reek of self esteem and confidence issues. I never feel like I'm good enough, like my partner is going to leave me for someone who is either more attractive, more physically fit, more mentally fit, more financially stable, etc. Granted it has never happened, these are issues that I create in my head and I can't seem to shoo them away as fast as I want to. I have progressively gotten better, but they still come up and I need the reassurance. \n\nBack to my recent breakup, she was my everything. I gave her my all, my 110%. I thought that this was going to be my soul mate. It was truly love at first sight. I put on my tough face, was open about my insecurity issues and she was more than happy to help me with that and reassure me. I cooked for her, cleaned for her, we went to the gym together, everything. She made me so happy, and then it all fell apart. I was blocked out of the blue, no form of contact, nothing. I miss her so fucking much. She made me so happy, it's like I'm back to square one on working on myself.\n\nWe made a list of goals we wanted to accomplish for us as solo and us as a couple, and I'm scared that I'm slowly falling back and regressing to my old ways\n\nI'm not eating as much, I spend a majority of my free time in my room laying in my bed watching YouTube or aimlessly scrolling.\n\nI hate my job, but I need it to stay afloat, but the problem with that is that I'm not getting enough hours to pay all of my finances, and it pays more than a majority of jobs that are hiring in the area. I can't afford to pick up another job, for the sake of my physical exhaustion and I feel as if it will destroy my mental health even more. \n\nI don't know what I want to do with my life. I'm not interested in any of the previous jobs I've worked and using that experience because I was miserable in those fields. \n\nI canceled my Netflix so I can use that expense towards a gym membership (I also never really used it), I want to continue adding to my savings, but with my hours and pay, my budget is very tight and it's difficult for me to save. I want to eat better and read more, get off of socials because I truly have no purpose on them other than scrolling my life away on them. I hate wasting the free time I have, but I don't know what to do with it or how to get out of this depressive rut. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is I need some tips and tricks as to how I can achieve these goals without the need or want of someone else trying to push me, because I don't know if I can do it alone.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I have read a lot of yours and I am proud of this community and all that we do to help each other out. Each and every one of you is beautiful and strong in their own way.",

        "text": "Hey,  \n I turned 18 last November. I’m on self-improvement since 4 Months now. I am starting to exercise, start to read, taking a step back from the internet and other good habits. I even started to go skateboarding outside just for fun, something I never expected from myself, I do before 5 months. And best of all, I’m feeling amazing. I really can't imagine my life without it, and there is so more I can improve about myself what makes me exited (Like writing, as you see).  \n But there is one thing that really pulls me down.  \n I shouldn’t go on the internet with this, but I don’t know who else should I go to.  \n When I started to go into my new school, and after a month I became pretty good friends with most people in my class. I really had a good time with them, what felt fantastic. But since one or two months something change. I felt really distance from theme without wanting to. I want to talk to them, but there is nothing I can say that would lead into an interesting conversation. I want to make them laugh like I use to, but most of the time I can’t think of something that would be funny or say something that isn’t even funny. I feel left out and not part of the group. There are moments where things are better, but these are fleeting moments.  \n They are not bad people (most of them. I keep my distance from theme) and are valuable people. They take their work seriously and are really friendly.  \n So I am sure that I’m the problem.  \n It could be my lack of social skills, or it could be that I am just not that interesting, what are both things on that I'm working on.  \n I don’t really know what it is, but it fells horrible and sometimes let me think that whatever I do not even matter.  \n People are probably telling me to just talk to them, but that’s something I already did at max 3 times and I don’t want to be constantly asking “aRE wE aCTuaLly friENDS?”.  \n I have a close bond to my family and are really close friend that I would trust my life with who I have a pretty healthy relationship with. There are also small connections I made here and there, but still I can’t feel anything different as lonely. Yes, I should be more grateful of what I have (What I am), but I don’t want to too only be able to speak to my relatives and childhood friend.

I would descripe myself as a person that see's every little change in a persons behavior or face and that's a curse for me because I always think it has something to do with me. Did I do something wrong? Did I say something bad? Am I too boring to be talked to? These are the questions that pop up in my head.\n\nI don't have that many friends and the ones I have don't write or invite me very often. But that is because I don't write them and when they invite me I either decline or leave very early. No wonder they don't ask me.\n\nI am in a relationship right now and I really love my boyfriend. He does a lot of these little things and is very nice to me. I see the stuff that he does but I can't appreciate it as much as I want to. We had a situation a few days ago. For the past two weeks I struggle with stomach problems and he knows that. I wanted to eat a bit cleaner (what he didn't know!) and he said to me we can order some pizza later and I just thought to myself \"is he dumb? why should I eat pizza when I have stomach problems.\" and I told him exactly this... But like I said he didn't know I wanted to eat less junk food. I don't know I just thought he would use his brain. But he didn't know and I still got furious that pisses me of so much. New years eve we were partying at his place and they wanted to go to the city after that and I instantly got mad because I didn't want to go. \"Why doesn't he want to stay with me here\" \"Why doesn't he love me\" blablabla instead of just going with them and having fun. I don't know what my fucking problem is..\n\nWe see each other only at the weekends because I don't ask him if we want to see each other because I think \"If he would want to see me HE would ask\" you see the problem here..\n\nRight now I am this girl that sits in the corner of a party and observes everyone with a resting bitchface. Is mad at everything and everyone if not everything happened as planned. The girl that is not nice to her boyfriend but expects him to be nice to her everytime. The girl that expects him to ask for dates, cuddles, kisses etc. but doesn't give a shit in return. Sorry for my language but I piss myself off so much it is crazy.\n\nI want to be the girl that is happy, the girl that can be spontanious and fun to talk to and hang out with. The girl that is nice to her boyfriend and just doesn't think that any slight demeanor change has something to do with her. I want to be all these things but I CANT and I don't know why.\n\nI am stuck in a permanent thinking spiral of \"Oh he looks at me like something is wrong. - What is wrong? - What did I do wrong? Am I not good enough? - He wants to break up..\"\n\nI need it to stop! Any tips? I don't want to be like this anymore.\n\nSorry for my bad english but my brain doesn't work properly right now..",

I really can't imagine my life without it, and there is so more I can improve about myself what makes me exited (Like writing, as you see).  \nBut there is one thing that really pulls me down.  \nI shouldn’t go on the internet with this, but I don’t know who else should I go to.  \nWhen  I started to go into my new school, and after a month I became pretty  good friends with most people in my class. I really had a good time with  them, what felt fantastic.  But since one or two months something change. I felt really distance  from theme without wanting to. I want to talk to them, but there is  nothing I can say that would lead into an interesting conversation. I want to make them laugh like I use to, but most of the time I can't think of something that would be funny or say something that isn’t even funny. I feel left out and not part of the group. There are moments where things are better, but these are fleeting moments.  \nThey  are not bad people (most of them. I keep my distance from theme) and  are valuable people. They take their work seriously and are really  friendly.  \nSo I am sure that I’m the problem.  \nIt could be my lack of social skills, or it could be that I am just not that interesting, what are both things on that I'm working on.  \nI don’t really know what it is, but it fells horrible and sometimes let me think that what ever I do not even matter.  \nPeople  are probably telling me to just talk to them, but that’s something I  already did at max 3 times and I don’t want to be constantly asking “aRE wE aCTuaLly friENDS?”.  \nI have a close bond to my family and are really close friend that I would trust my life with who  I have a pretty healthy relationship with.

        "text": "#  No more confusing thought patterns, make sense of life through productive thinking using mental models.\n\n#  Confirmation Bias\n\nThink of an individual who holds a belief **that a particular stock is going to rise in value.** They only seek information supporting this belief, such as positive news articles or analyst recommendations. They ignore or dismiss any negative information, such as **market trends or financial reports,** suggesting the stock may not perform as well as expected. As a result, this person may make investment decisions based on confirmation bias, **which can lead to poor financial outcomes.**  \n\n\n# Emotional Bank Account\n\nIn a **romantic relationship,** where a couple has built trust, respect, and love by communicating openly and showing appreciation for each other. However, when one **partner makes a mistake like lying**, it can damage the trust and the emotional bank account. But by making amends and rebuilding trust, t**he relationship can strengthen the emotional bank account.**  \n\n\n#  Illusion of Control\n\nMany people believe that **they can control the outcome of a game of chance through their actions,** such as choosing certain numbers on a slot machine or counting cards in blackjack. However, the outcome of these games is ultimately determined by chance, and no amount of strategy or skill can change that. **Despite this, many people continue to gamble**, believing that they have some level of control over the outcome. This belief can lead to problem gambling and **other negative consequences.**  \n\n\n# Model of Self-Handicapping\n\nImagine a student who doesn't study for an exam because **they \"know they will do bad anyway\"** or an athlete who skips practice because they are \"not in the right mood\". By not putting in the effort, **they can attribute any failure or poor performance** to the obstacle **they created for themselves,** rather than their own lack of effort or skill. This behavior can be detrimental in the long run as it can create a cycle of avoiding challenges**, and limit the person's ability to improve** and reach their full potential.  \n\n\n# Tawakkul\n\nImagine that you are worried about the future and unsure of what steps to take next. To apply the **mental model of Tawakkul**, you might: Reflect on your values and goals and try to focus on the present moment Trust that God has a plan for you and try to let go of **excessive worry** Do your best in your current circumstances and **have faith that things will work out as they are meant to.**  \n\n\n*P.S. Let's have a discussion on which mental models you use regularly and how it benefits you.*",

        "text": "We met in summer 2019. We quickly “fell in love”- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt “head over heels” and she (34f) felt the same. She’s the most naturally beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other’s families and things were getting serious—saying “I love you” and making plans for our shared future—right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I’m “as handsome as ever”, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then— she had a boyfriend and we shouldn’t have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn’t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that “was music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‘long game’” because she wasn’t single.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she “does love me, but is scared.” After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like “we shouldn’t have done that”) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. I got routinely hurt—really badly—by her cruel hot/cold treatment of me, and eventually went “no contact” in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April of this year, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship. Seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. \n\nBy June, we were saying “I love you,” going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. Happiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things after a weekend away with her parents in October. She “didn’t love my anymore.”\n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner—usually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts—cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. In the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced “love bombing” —she would say things like “I hope our kids have your face,” “I can’t wait to move in with you,””I love you,” “I’m crazy about you” and “you’re so important to me.” This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her recently over Christmas, only to be told she’s now in a “serious” relationship and doesn’t “feel right about seeing each other one-on-one.” I told her I still love her, she simply said that was “problematic.” The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI ran into her the other day at CVS, turned down the isle and boom there she was. I walked up and said hi, she gave me a hug and I wished her well etc, and walked away. Seeing her was absolutely heartbreaking and I can’t stop thinking about her. I really just want to reach out to see how she’s doing— I care about her so deeply I can’t help it. \n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, please share because I’m at a loss and can’t get over it.

I love my friends and they’re the best people to ever enter my life, but I can’t even find the right words to describe them in a positive way past “amazing” or “you’re a great person” and I feel terrible. \n\nAnd when someone makes a mistake or does something that isn’t perfect(like a drawing or singing or smth), my first reaction is to mentally berate or insult them(I’d never say it out loud tho) but I want to be able to think positive things like how I can help them improve or what they’re already doing well or etc. \n\nPlease help, I just wanna be a better person.",

That monkey is the fella that drives all your thoughts and actions, it doesn’t know what it’s doing it just get’s a notification to push a button and flip levers.\n\nNotifications come from the way you talk to yourself and the environment around you, so if you can change the monkey’s inputs you will change the monkey’s outputs.\n\n****How to Change the Monkey’s Inputs****\n\n1. **Change The Way You Speak to Yourself.**\n\nTake a second to analyze your thoughts, go for a walk with no music, or sit down with nothing distracting you. What do you feel?\n\nIf you feel bad it’s because your monkey in your brain is receiving inputs from yourself to make you feel bad.\n\nA common self belief I heard from my clients is to believe they’re lazy. An easy way to fix this is by constantly telling yourself you’re a hard worker, and the monkey will return that input with the lever for you to work hard.\n\nYes, I know it sounds cringe so don’t tell anyone you’re saying mantras to yourself all day. But for however cringe and “woo” it is, it worked for me so it will work for you too. There’s a book called “Psycho Cybernetics” that goes into detail on changing the way you think of yourself check it out if you’re interested in the science of this topic.\n\n**2. Change Your Environment**Does a healthy person have chips, sweets, and processed food all over their house? No! Even if they did, they wouldn’t eat it because it doesn’t push them toward their goals.\n\nIf you’re surrounded by people who drill into you that you’re a fat, lazy person, the monkey will hear that and hit the lazy &amp; fat lever. You need to remove those hateful people out of your life.\n\nMove locations, unfollow, and remove them from your life because they will not serve your Big P.P. goal and you will continue to be the person they’ve always known in your eyes. A square peg can’t fit through a circle hole, such that a healthy person’s goal doesn't align with an unhealthy person's goals.\n\nChange how you see yourself and your actions will follow suit.\n\nIf you want to learn more on how to design a body you’re proud to share  me shoot me a message. I love to help people!\n\n- Drew Quatro from Quatro Health Club",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10w8ibj/how_i_stopped_saying_i_dont_have_enough_time/",
        "text": "As a medical student, I often felt overwhelmed by the sense that there wasn't enough time in the day to complete all of my tasks. Between attending lectures, studying, and trying to maintain a social life, it seemed like the stress and pressure of balancing everything was too much. However, after a few years, I realized that my belief that \"I don't have enough time\" was more about my perception than reality. I discovered five root causes of this feeling and hope to share them to help others experiencing similar problems.\n\n**Procrastination**  \nWe are all familiar with this dream killer. To fight it, try breaking tasks into smaller chunks and setting deadlines for yourself. Also, eliminate distractions like social media or notifications during specific work time slots. Consider getting an accountability partner who can help keep you on track.\n\n**Lack of Prioritization**  \nPrioritization is a key factor often overlooked. Select one \"most important\" task for the day and do nothing else until it's completed. Learn to differentiate between important and unimportant tasks and between urgent and non-urgent ones.\n\n**Poor Time Management Techniques**  \nTry using different techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, Time Blocking, or scheduling specific times for checking social media. This can help you keep your work and leisure time balanced.\n\n**Overcommitting**  \nTo avoid this, learn to say no to non-essential tasks and set realistic expectations. We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, so try increasing the time frame by 50% when setting achievable plans.\n\n**Neglecting Self-Care**  \nIn college, it's easy to neglect self-care in favor of studying, but remember to schedule breaks and engage in activities you find enjoyable. Taking care of yourself can actually make you happier and more productive in the long run.",

        "text": "I have realized for a long time now that I have become very competitive for a wide variety of situations ranging from studies to simple games that I play with friends (not including video games). And I have also realized that this nature of mine has made me more volatile and more anger/cry prone when things don't go my way, whilst also at the same time I tend to shove up my achievements up to everyone's faces to a point where they think I am being completely petty and annoying. \n\nI myself have also felt that I have become more malicious towards everyone, including my close friends to a point where I have started speaking in a really terrible version of humility where even when, say for example my friend got an average mark and she felt bad about it. But even while I was sitting next to her i kept saying how terrible my mark was and I wasn't proud of it even though I did get a lot more than her. \n\nYeah, you can say just from reading this, that i can be such an asshole sometimes and that's the thing; I just wish I wasn't, I wish I had the ability to think before i speak/act. I wish I could be able to comfort my friends when they need it the most instead of having them listen to my toxic bullshit every time. But I just don't know how and as of now i feel incredibly terrible for all the shit I've done and said to them till now. \n\nI only wish to a sensible, humble and approachable person who can always cheer up others and at the same time not cry over a lost game or a bad set of grades like",

We have not particulary discussed it yet.\n\nI have a separation agreement in hand. Ready to present to my wife. We have talked about divorce before, but I know she thinks I am bluffing. I am ready, but one thing weighs on my mind.  I am asking for a divorce because there is no more love. We are just two people that live together that have kids in common. It is a terrible feeling knowing I will never experiance any more love in my life, so I feel like I must try.\n\nSo my question is, how do you date when you have joint custody of young kids? I am sure I will have time during my week without the kids, but in all fairness, who would want to date some awkward older guy with two young kids? Yea I might be able to have a fling here or there, (I can count on one hand how many times I have had sex in the past 3 years) but I am looking for love. That is why I am divorcing to begin with. Can anyone reassure me that this is actually possible at this point in my life?\n\nThis question is really weighing on me.",
