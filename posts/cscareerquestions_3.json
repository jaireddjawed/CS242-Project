        "text": "I'm currently a Sophomore majoring in CS and started looking for Summer Internships very late. With the very few opportunities available, I did fairly good in my interview process and was lucky enough to get an offer from two well known companies. I plan to be a Software Engineer and would love to pursue an internship opportunity that will prepare me for this role, however I have a counter offer which will make almost twice as much as a Data Analyst. I am having trouble deciding which offer to accept so my question is would I be better off taking on a position I don't have any interest in pursuing a career in and making more money or sticking to my career path and making less. Lets break down my two offers:\n\nOffer 1: This offer is a Data Analyst Intern position for a very big Bank. I have been told that I will have the opportunity to work alongside the Tech team and we will be collecting data to train an AI. I am very interested in AI and the role sounds more like a Data Scientist/Engineer than an Analyst so I feel like I could just put that I was a Data Engineer on my resume. They are offering me around $40/hour. The only things really keeping me from choosing this position are the title of the role and the location. I plan to be a Software Engineer in the future and would love to have an experience that will prepare me for internships next Summer, and a Software Engineer title to put on my resume.\n\nOffer 2: This offer if a Software Engineer Intern position for a less known Tech company. In this role I would be working alongside people who are Software Engineers and working on a Summer-long project specific to Software. The location of this internship is perfect and I believe I will get much more experience in the field I am interested in. The only downside is they are only offering me $22/hour compared to the $40/hour for the other position.\n\nWhich position will set me up better for my future? Will taking the Data Analyst role and having that on my resume hurt my chances at getting a better Software Engineering role next Summer? I am torn between the two options and can't decide.",

Rent, extra expenses i would need to pay to live in Cali etc. (after doing some research, damn is California expensive in comparison) \n- can i get to work without a car? \n- Would it be difficult to relocate coming from Spain without much savings and the savings I have would maybe last me like a month at most \n- Would i be able to rent a small 1bd apartment from abroad or is that sketch? \n- which areas can I find decent rent with a good neighborhood? \n\n\nAnd any other tips and advice on relocating and work life would be amazing. Also would like to know what else to ask the company upon negotiation of the contract. Thanks so much!  \n\nReally excited about this offer but after doing some digging I got quite scared in the financial aspects and just making the jump in general.",

It lasts a few days and is pretty much just the standard large group corporate meeting stuff.\n\nI’m sure there will also be after-work ‘happy hour’ team events too, which I wouldn’t have a good excuse to skip, since I would’ve already travelled across the country to attend the event. Company headquarters are near the east coast, which is pretty far from me.\n\nSo, I have absolutely no intention of going unless they plan to pay me for travel time and all the extra hours I’d have to spend away from home. But I realize that’s probably not a smart thing to say to my boss, who probably has no control over the situation either, so I’ll turn it down in a more thoughtful way. I’m not really seeing the point of going, and it feels like if you travel to something like this, you’re giving 24hrs a day to your company instead of just 8.\n\nIm somewhat new to this as it’s the first time it’s come up in my career…so my question is: how common is it for your company to ask you to travel? Do you ever go and do you ever feel like it’s worth it? If not, how was your refusal received?",

Have worked for Ford, Harley-Davidson, Hitachi, and others. \n\nNot quite 2 years ago, I got married to a girl from Spain, and due to the circumstances, we have been living in Spain since July 2021. When I moved, I knew zero Spanish and only had my passport and American marriage license. I now have a decent conversational and technical level of the language and have all my paperwork in order and am on my way to becoming a USA-Spain dual citizen.\n\nJob market here is notoriously bad. I took the first even-sort-of-technical job I could find, which saw me being a waterjet machine technician, travelling Europe maintaining and repairing waterjets for a 25,000€ salary. After a year of that, I had a decent level of technical Spanish (driving a car with another tech that is native for 8 hours a day will do that) so I jumped to an engineering job working for a solar panel systems company. I am earning a 35,000€ salary here, which is considered very good.\n\nGenerally, I find engineering miserable, even moreso when you earn 1/3 of what you are used to and the Spanish office culture grinds you down. I did a deep dive into my university memories about \"which classes did I actually enjoy most?\" and the answer was programming. My C++ classes were my favorite, but it never occurred to me that I could change course and go with Comp Sci (I was a first-gen college student, I made lots of mistakes).\n\nMy goal now is to find a fully remote developer (or similar) position that would allow me to work from either the USA or Spain, and the salary is not super important. Obviously, landing a USA-based gig with USA pay would be amazing, but I'm a simple man.\n\nAnother twist: A few weeks ago we found out my wife is pregnant. Accidental. So the ability to work from home would be double fantastic if I could change diapers between coding sessions.\n\nRight now, I am learning Python and have Javascript next on the list, so I can work toward knowing a full stack. \n\nI just want to know from others who have had similar career changes or situations, am I headed in the right direction? Am I working on a solid stack? What advice would you give and what do you wish you knew before pivoting?",

Thought I'd share it here for laughs.\n\nThis company exclusively contracts for the government and works with various agencies. The first round is with the CEO and his ~~wife~~ HR manager.\n\nOnce introductions are done he starts talking about the training regimen I will be receiving from him and the various team members. I will be highly trained to wear multiple hats unlike the monkeys out there in big tech corps. Yea dude called developers at big corps monkeys. He elaborated by saying big corp devs only work on miniscule portions of the codebase with limited scope.\n\nDude then proceeded to gush on and on about his excellent bs detector, how he can sniff bs from a mile away so no one dares to cross him.\n\nNext, he asked if I smoke (WTF). I asked if he is referring to smoke breaks, he said yea, but more importantly in meetings the smell of cigarettes is a no go (I guess smokers can't work office jobs then by his logic). Next he proceeded to school me on dress code, like how the data centers kick people out for not wearing business formal so employees should always turn up in suit and tie when trips to data centers are required.\n\nAfterwards I was told I cannot be actively developing public facing side projects because whatever tech I'm trained on by this company is used for ultra top secret government projects. By that logic I cannot have public ReactJS projects on GitHub lol.\n\nI was then grilled on whether I have any criminal convictions, bankruptcies or whatever because government.\n\nTbh the entire interview was weird and uncomfortable. This CEO also uses the word \"shit\" very liberally. Each time I answer something he would try to one up me. His ~~wife~~ HR manager would always interject with stupid questions for some reason.\n\nThis CEO also mentioned he is very busy and spends most of his day at meetings or reading technical white papers to know the latest tech and trends for his ultra confidential projects I guess. Yea dude just wanna brag he read technical papers.\n\nAll in all definitely not joining them lol.",

        "text": "I've been looking at job offers to get an idea of what to expect once I finish my bachelor's degree, and also because I've been trying to find a part-time to help my family pay for my University fees.\n\nWhile I've been as open as possible when i was looking for a part-time, since the kind of job doesn't matter too much to me as long as it allows me to keep studying, it would be nice if it was something tech related, as i can get some experience under the belt and an idea of what it's actually like to work in this field \n\n The problem I'm facing is that all of these entry positions are usually full time and require being proficient in 5+ coding languages with 2+ other languages added in where they dont ask proficiency but expect you to still be able to read/modify code in.\n\nWhile I like the courses we've studied, most of the classes we've had so far are pure math and logic, the only coding language we've actually studied is java, with some touches of SQL and Lisp (though I have been studying python on the side, and i think i can code in both java and python with the same proficiency).\n\nI've been mostly looking through Indeed, and I live in Italy.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\\-  is this considered normal for those kind of positions? \n\n\\- am I looking in the wrong place? \n\n\\- should I try harder to find tech related jobs even if in a year or so there would be a period of internship where i would be guided by my University?\n\nTLDR: Student is trying to get into the tech/coding field early to help pay for the University fee and to get experience early, stares at the pc for 4 hours every night looking at entry level jobs with an \"x (Needed)/ x (Proficient)\" list that makes him scroll more than 2 times to reach the end.",

I created a whole marketplace (from payments integration with Stripe, order-management, logistics etc) including mobile app in Swift/Swiftui/OBJC, backends with SQL, Javascript (Node.js) and website in Next.js to facilitate everything I have spent pretty much 10-14 hours a day coding/designing/planning almost everyday for the past 1.5 years with no social life.\n\nThe business has done well but it means everyday I am highly stressed and don't really get to live life beyond what I am doing in work.\n\nAs a potential employer... Would they be interested in what I have done or would they still think I am inexperienced and not a valuable junior/mid-developer. \n\nI am worried when I apply for jobs and they ask about my experience, when I say I worked for myself and built x-y-z (I would say it's a fairly impressive e-commerce solution with a nice interface, well written code for the most part, lot's to be improved ofc) that they will be turned off by the fact that I was doing it all myself.\n\nWould you have any advice on how I should approach selling myself, I would say the product is impressive and feedback is that my app/website is much nicer to use than some solutions with millions of $$$ behind them by many external people through feedback forms.\n\nThe stress of running my own business and lack of living a life beyond my business at this young age has now made me want to just change for a healthier lifestyle rather than money.\n\nThank you for any advice on how I should approach this when entering formal career market.",

        "text": " I personally think that these layoffs are happening because during the COVID-19 pandemic (which lasted for approximately 2.5 years), companies hired a lot of people due to the sudden surge in demand for online services. Imagine the entire world was working online. Now that everything is returning to normal and markets are open, there is a standard demand for software developers, system engineers, and related fields. Therefore, companies are taking this opportunity to lay off either highly paid or poor-performing employees. And, same people are facing issue getting new jobs because they may ask high or same package and those poor preforming employees are struggling with skill set.  \n\nPlease enlighten me if I am wrong I am ready to accept it.

Im studying and still helping out this senior freelancer who pays me descent but its part time and not really viable.\nI want to maybe start working on an own project that would be cool you use but thinking about it being iOS only and the app store is literally flooded with all kinds of app juniors are able to build just discourages me to start. \nWhen you see web dev or anything for windows is just much more able to produce on their own.\nWill i ever be able to become anything more than a senior developer who works for a company his whole life? \nAnd how do i even reach senior level experience when everyone is hiring only seniors?",

The ridiculously high salaries in tech were thanks to him.\n\nCOVID then further inflated the tech bubble, and the \"a day in the life of a Meta PM\" girls and \"break into tech\" influencers did the rest. Now, 3 years later, the economic downturn will bring the tech industry to pre-COVID state or below.\n\nThe problem is that tech companies like Meta are overstaffed, overinflated, overvalued, inefficient, and have 10 layers of useless middle management. If you want a proof, think about it this way - why does the stock market react so positively to tech layoffs if layoffs usually are a bearish signal?\n\nUnfortunately, Meta has the worst future outlook of the big tech companies. No one except non-tech-savvy people thinks that Metaverse will be the next thing, as proven by the stock price again. The 11,000 + 10,000 employees laid off are a first correction of the COVID overhiring, the new RTO policies are further silent layoffs, and the 5,000 open roles closed will prevent any growth in the near future.\n\nAt the time being, I don't see a way out of this for Meta.",

He was not concerned about what it did he was concerned how fast it learns, and imo he's quite right it's been like few years and this tool has already become an absolute beast in homework/exam cheating. \n\nHowever the architect was less 'stressed' about it he said its going to save us more time to think on more serious stuff, like 20years ago we didn't have IDE with autocomplete for example.\n\nIt really makes me wonder if software engineering as a career path is actually a good idea. It feels like it's becoming more and more 'swapable' with AI. I guess complex systems are still too complex for AI but 30 years ago no one would think there's gonna be device that you can hold in your hand that's gonna be 100 times more powerful than their computers so i guess we need to be careful. What do you think? Is ML/AI the only career path that's actually gonna not only stay in huge demand but also will open new career paths in the future?",

        "text": "4th year student here and we are asked to choose a specialisation this term out of these five:\n\n1- software development (mostly web/database classes and some compilers classes)\n\n2- data science (similar to software development but replaces some of the webdev classes with stuff about big data, data mining, and statistics).\n\n3- Intelligent systems (has an expert systems class, virtual reality.. Etc)\n\n4- Machine learning (replaces some of the mentioned with deep learning, big data, internet of things..)\n\n5- systems and networks (I've always been interested in systems and low level programming, but I am not a fan of the nature of must jobs involving networks).\n\n\n\nI know many people argue that these specialisations are not important when you graduate, and an internship is much more useful but I am trying to work with what I have and I feel like the type of classes that I take even if they won't prepare me for a career, at least they would push me toward a general direction.\n\nIf I was to consider what I find 'interesting' then I would say data engineering jobs sounds cool, or something to do with working with low level languages idk, I just hate web/android dev. \n\n\nWhat do you think?",

I'm looking for experiences similar to this and how it effected your career, how you represented it on your resume, etc.\n\nMy background:\n\n1. Bachelors of Computer Science 3.5 GPA &amp; a Bachelors of Psychology\n2. 1+ year of experience as a full stack developer with a small start up. React/Typescript/Python/Postgresql/GCP/Docker. Company was sad to see me go and the founder and my manager both stated they would definitely give me positive referral.\n3. 8+ years of management experience (not in code)\n4. Decent amount of side projects using other languages\n\nI recently got a new job as a \"Database Developer\". I applied to be a full stack engineer at the company and got to the interview portion. I heard I wasn't chosen and thought that was that.\n\nI get an email from someone at the company wanting to talk over the phone. They were very long winded explaining their opinions on a lot of tangential things, as well as the direction for their department, mentioning things like spinning up new repos. They ask about my experience with databases but eventually got to the point of offering me a job with them for a different position. Said I didn't get the job I applied for but that I would be a good fit for this role given my experience.\n\nIn the offer letter the pay was 150% more than what my previous job was paying me, closer to where I live, and some better benefits in terms of 401k.\n\nI finally start, and I come to find out I'm a glorified CRM manager. I'm managing their app in Quickbase. I don't think I'm going to be writing any code for this job, and can't help but feel like this is going to be black mark on resume.\n\nThe work environment also doesn't seem like a place where I would grow much, even if I was writing code for them. They seem very disorganized in terms of roles. No one seems to know what anyone else does and apparently the turnover rate for many of the positions is high.\n\nMy previous job stated the door was still open if I didn't like my new job. I've never done that before and I have my reservations about returning to a job I previously left. I've already started applying to new jobs.\n\nHas anyone had this happen to them, or interviewed people who have had this happen to the them and what was your experience? Would any of you recommend going back to my previous job? Find ways to code in this current job? Just hope it looks good on my resume and jump ship asap?",

I previously had this role in addition to an IC role that was wrapped into the title of \"Team Lead\".\n\nI've never worked for a company this small nor have I worked for a company where I had the chance to acquire stock.  I feel like I'm in a position where I do not l know what I don't know and looking for some advice.   If there is a better place to post then please let me know.\n\nI have the chance to acquire \"options\", which if I understand correctly from googling around is basically the right to purchase stock at some price in the future.  This is different than RSUs which is what a company like Google would offer.  The options have the stipulation of a \"1 year cliff, 5-year vesting\".  Is this pretty standard?\n\nPretty much the options are worthless in my mind.  It's basically a lottery ticket, but salary is double than what I'm getting now which is why I'm considering this.  Granted I currently live north of Boston, MA and I would have to relocated before the end of the year to NorCal to work in a hybrid office.  This is a robotics company working with an embedded team, so it's not unreasonable.  \n\nThe company actually gave me 2 offers to consider with varying amount of options and base pay. I'm not sure if I should read in to this as to how much they think their options are worth today.  The 2 offers are the follow with a \"1 year cliff, 5-year vesting\".\n\n    Salary:  $210K\n    Options: 19,000\n    \n    Salary:  $220K\n    Options: 9,500\n\nA question I already have is how much would I have to pay for the options since that was not listed.  I think this is called a strike price, if I googled correctly.\n\nShould I care about the number of outstanding options there are out there?  Does the percent that represent the 19K they are offering me matter?  \n\nI previously asked about the Silicon Valley Bank issue and while they had their money there they assured me that they have access to it and is in process of moving to a new bank.  I feel like I should be asking more questions around this, but I'm not sure what I what would be good to know.\n\nI already have questions about relocation assistance, signing bonus, health care plans, 401K plans, and so forth.  Is it unreasonable to expect to see the details of the various plans vs the name of the plan?\n\nI'm sure there are tons more question I don't even know I should care about.  Thanks for any suggestions!",

        "text": "Help — and also urgent help, lol.\n\nIn a nutshell. Promoted to Lead UX Writer at a smallish company after 1 year. Excellent performance @ review. \n\n**Offered salary is:**   \n1. Below market rate  \n2. The SAME as in Dec 2021 for that role  \nScreenshot from HR back then says \"rest assured, we adjust annually for inflation etc.\" Haha, clearly not!\n\nI fire back, ask for more. My managers agree. HR says the CEO is \"unhappy\" with copy overall, wants x change rather than complaining it's poor work. Just this week, proof that company structure is so poor, good UX copy is getting pushed aside.\n\nFriend says literally book a meeting with the CEO. HR is a dead end. Sell stability — replacing me costs way more. Show the poor structure that's blocked the good copy (have evidence). Be the solution. But it all seems very aggressive. What would you do? \n\nThank you in advance. FYI, am in the UK. Cannot legally be fired over this.\n\nAlso, I posted here because I trust you CS folks and UX is tech.",

        "text": "I graduated in May with a B.s in CompSci and have made 2 final interviews for a SWE jobs but no offers. I recently got an offer for a consulting job.  There is a marginal amount of coding involved, and in a proprietary coding language similar to Java.  Basic SQL statements are also used.  Other potentially transferable experience would be working in an Agile environment.  A CS degree is not required for the job, and most of the people in the role have an IT degree or an Information Science degree to give an explanation of the actual amount of CompSci expertise they were looking for.\n\nDue to life events/trying to get through school in a shorter amount of time, I took summer classes instead of taking an internship during college (a mistake I know), and I know this is one of the reasons it is so difficult for me to find a job.\n\nIt seems like most of the people who were in my position eventually go into data science or another consulting or management job.  I was only able to find a few people who went into software engineering after holding my position on LinkedIn, and they either had a Masters in IT prior to taking this job or a prior SWE internship.  The pay is decent (65k/yr remote work + benefits) but would taking this job hurt my prospects of eventually going into Software Engineering?",
