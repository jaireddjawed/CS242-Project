It was an extremely faint blue that you really wouldn’t notice unless you happened to be as close as I was and not many people are going to lay facedown in the woods at night. So I was curious if there might be any literature on naturally occurring luminescence in the contiguous United States that might have the answers I’m looking for. I’ve done some light research on the subject and cannot find any fungi or bacteria that are know to exist in NC that produce luminescent chemicals. I am also fairly certain that it was produced biologically. It seemed to be mixed in to the substrate just below the leaf litter on the forest floor. The slight glow was to faint to capture on camera and I didn’t have a container to collect a sample. Not that I would’ve know what to do with any of it anyway.",

This would mean kind of dead fat... un-communicable and will just sit there.\n\nI am reading that an increase of leptin can help to stimulate these nerves, so that they grow. ALso that the spine can be stimulated in certain areas to help promote nerve innervation in fat.\n\nDoes this also mean that stimulating certain areas of the spine could trigger leptin production?",

I know I want to do something related to biology, but I’m not sure if I should do biology or wildlife biology. I feel like with a biology major there will be more job options, but with a wildlife biology major the job pool will be more limited. I would prefer wildlife biology, but I know jobs like that don’t pay all that well…\nThanks for any help!",

        "text": "Planning on using standard blood agar, one agar w/ a virus and one blood agar without that same virus; one blood agar with lice of patients with white blood cells and one type of blood agar without; same for antibodies. (source: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14614439](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14614439). In 3 below, they use this method but I'm hoping an agar w/ a regular incubator might work as I dont have a PCR or electrophoresis in my home lab...yet:\n\nAll PCR amplification was performed using a Peltier PTC-200 model thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA, USA). Reactions were carried out using the Hotstar Taq-polymerase (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative and positive controls were included in each assay. The success of amplification was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.\n\n1. Body lice are known to transmit disease ([epidemic typhus](https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/epidemic/index.html), [*Bartonella quintana*](https://www.cdc.gov/bartonella/bartonella-quintana/index.html) infection, and [epidemic relapsing fever](https://www.cdc.gov/relapsing-fever/resources/louse.html)).\n2. To date, there are three known louse-borne diseases: [epidemic typhus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/epidemic-typhus), epidemic [relapsing fever](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/relapsing-fever), and [trench fever](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/trench-fever). These infections particularly affect populations living in poor-hygiene conditions where body louse infestations are prevalent. Whereas epidemic typhus and epidemic relapsing fever are particularly prevalent in vulnerable populations in developing countries, trench fever is common worldwide, especially in homeless individuals. Regular surveys of these populations and the implementation of efficient delousing strategies are necessary to prevent major epidemics of known louse-borne diseases or other potentially emerging louse-borne pathogens, such as *A. baumannii* and *Y. pestis.* (source: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14614439](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14614439) and [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22360386/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22360386/))\n3. In conclusion, our finding of several Malian head lice which were positive for *B*. *quintana*, *C*. *burnetii*, *R*. *aeschlimannii*, *Anaplasma* and *Ehrlichia* is alarming. Currently, our understanding of the role of human head lice in the epidemiology of these emerging pathogenic bacteria is limited. Since head lice feed only on human blood \\[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5606924/#pone.0184621.ref005),[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5606924/#pone.0184621.ref032)\\], an assumption which is further evidenced in our study by the identification of human blood meal in all head lice with positive bacterial-DNA, the obtained results imply that the acquired infections are from the blood of patients with ongoing bacteremia. Hence, our study provides a starting point for epidemiological studies in this area and active survey programs should be encouraged.
