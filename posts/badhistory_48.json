        "text": "Some of you may be familiar with my first post on this matter, which was made [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/26wp0c/the_enigma_of_hitler_when_nazis_write_history/) anyways this is the second of the three \"essays\" written by former Waffen-SS member Leon Degrelle, who planned to put a bunch of them in book before he died. The first one dealt with Hitler, and this one does to some extent, but it also covers the rise of the Waffen-SS, which in Degrelle's mind constituted the first real \"European Army\". The article is [here](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v03/v03p441_Degrelle.html)\n\n\nAfter some more background on Leon Degrelle (The IHR really loves this guy), we are treated to this lovely quote\n\n&gt; The one million-strong Waffen SS represented the first truly European army to ever exist.\n\nSo this is the first really problematic assertion. This ignores two facts. One that the Waffen-SS was intended to serve Adolf Hitler/the Nazis directly and by extension Germany. Can it really be said that they were fighting for Europe when the goal of the Waffen-SS was to fight for the man who had dragged Europe into war and occupied over half of the bloody continent? And secondly, if we are counting multi national armies, wouldn't that honor go to the Grand Armee or the French Foreign Legion? The Grand Armee had about 300,000 foreign members, shouldn't they count.\n\nJust look at the oath the SS had to swear.\n\n&gt;\"I vow to you, Adolf Hitler, as Führer and chancellor of the German Reich loyalty and bravery. I vow to you and to the leaders, that you set for me, absolute allegiance, till death. So help me God!\"\n\nThat's hardly a European Army. \n\nNow we get past the opening and into the main body of Degrell's speech.\n\nAnd run head long into this\n\n&gt; Hitler rose to the chancellorship democratically, winning at the ballot box\n\nIt is true that in the 1932 elections the Nazis won the largest amount of seats, but Hitler was appointed Chancellor by Paul Von Hindenburg at the urging of Franz Von Papen, himself a former chancellor. Papen believed Hitler could be controlled and that is really the only reason Hitler gained power. Now maybe Degrelle is referring to the 1933 elections? Lets see what Richard J. Evans has to say on the matter of the 1933 elections \n\n&gt; Hitler had called for 5\nMarch. Amidst massive Nazi propaganda, paid for by an inflow of fresh funds from industry, and\nviolent intimidation, in which most rival political meetings were banned or broken up, the Nazis still\nfailed to achieve an overall majority, peaking at 44 per cent and only getting over the 50 per cent\nbarrier with the help of their conservative Nationalist coalition partners. The Communists still won\n12 per cent and the Social Democrats 18 per cent, with the Centre Party holding firm at 11 per cent of\nthe vote.\n\nThis of course not including the mass arrests of Communists and Social Democrats that occured after the Reichstage Fire.\n\nMoving on we get to this little gem.\n\n&gt; Later he succeeded always through the electoral process in increasing his majority. When some elections gave him up to 90% of the vote, Hitler earned every vote on his own merit\n\nThis is referring to the elections of November, 1933, its true that Hitler earned 90% of the vote, its also true that he was the only mainstream candidate as every other party had been banned.\n\nAfter this we get more Hitler hero worship, a brief history of the SA and a little blurb about the death of Ernst Rohm.\n\n&gt; The showdown resulted in the death of Roehm, either by suicide or murder\n\nGotta love how the Night of the Long Knives is referred to as a \"Showdown\". Assassinating your political opponents is now considered a \"fight\". Also for anyone who is curious, Rohm was murdered.\n\nSo after this we get *gasp* more fucking Hitler worship. More Hitler saved the economy bullshit, its been done to death so lets move on. \n\n**Finally** we get to something that is actually about the fucking Waffen-SS\n\n&gt; Hitler was opposed to any war, particularly in Western Europe. He did not even conceive that the SS could participate in such a war. Above all the SS was a political force\n\nFirst off you have to love the laughable assertion that Hitler was opposed to war. The man literally wrote a book about his plan to conquer land. Lets once again quote Richard J Evans on the matter\n\n&gt; The area in which Hitler took the most consistent and most detailed interest, however, was\nundeniably that of foreign policy and preparation for war. It was without question Hitler, personally,\nwho drove Germany towards war from the moment he became Reich Chancellor, subordinating every\nother aspect of policy to this overriding aim and, as we have seen, creating a growing number of\nstresses and strains in the economy, society and the political system as a result. The war he envisaged\nwas to be far more extensive than a series of limited conflicts designed to revise the territorial\nprovisions of the Treaty of Versailles. On one of many similar occasions, he announced on 23 May\n1928 that his intention was ‘to lead our people into bloody action, not for an adjustment of its\nboundaries, but to save it into the most distant future by securing so much land and ground that the\nfuture receives back many times the blood shed’.6 He did not modify this intention after he came to\npower\n\nThe other problematic assertion in Degrelle's statement is the idea that Hitler wanted the SS to stay involved in politics. Hitler had no strong opinion either way. It was Himmler who wanted the SS to stay completely under his control in the political sphere. It was people like Sepp Dietrich and Paul Hausser that convinced Hitler that there should be a separate branch of the SS dedicated to combat, and Hitler loved the idea. To quote Sepp Dietrich\n\n&gt; 'The concentration camps were run entirely by Himmler's Special SS police\nand guards and took a very different line to our own development. I met my\nlike-minded colleagues and we did our best to further our ends in organizing a\nnew model army. This came about very gradually and despite Himmler's desire\nto reserve them as political troops. Even after they were fully organized into\nregiments and began to receive military training Himmler still tried to usurp\nthem for his own ends.'\n\nDegrell than goes on a political rant about the dangers of Communism\n\n&gt; This is a dramatically new factor. This policy of world conquest is still being carried out today whether in Vietnam, Afganistan, Africa or Poland. At the time it was an entirely new concept. Alone among all the leaders of the world Hitler saw this concept as an equal threat to all nations.\n\nYes Hitler saw it all, Hitler is literally Miss Cleo.\n\n&gt; Now in the summer of 1939 the governments of Britain and France were secretly negotiating a full military alliance with the Soviet Union. The talks were held in Moscow and the minutes were signed by Marshal Zhukov.\n\nIt is true that the Soviets and the Western Allies were in talks, but they were hardly on the verge of signing some full on military alliance. Also considering that one of Allies' main goals was a preservation of Poland, I doubt they were just going to offer it to Stalin on a sliver plate. \n\nSkipping ahead some more we arrive at the invasion of Poland. And dam there is a lot of Bad History here.\n\n&gt; Of all the crimes of World War Two, one never hears about the wholesale massacres that occurred in Poland just before the war. I have detailed reports in my files documenting the mass slaughter of defenseless Germans in Poland\n\nIts is certainly true that on the outbreak of war between Germany and Poland that the Polish government, fearing sabotage, arrested a large amount of ethnic Germans and marched them East. Around 2000 people died in these marches. There is also the famous \"Bloody Sunday\" when 300 ethnic Germans were killed in a failed uprising against the Polish state. \n\nI'd hesitate to call that \"wholesale slaughter\". It was an unfortunate event, but the brutality is totally outclassed by what the Nazis would soon do to Poland.\n\n&gt; The Polish campaign showed Hitler to be a military genius. History had already started to recognize this most startling of Hitler's characteristics: his rare military genius. All the successful military campaigns of the Third Reich were thought out and directed by Hitler personally\n\nThe invasion of Poland was the brain child of the OKH Walter Von Brauchitsch. It gets even worse I'm afraid. \n\n&gt; The story goes that Hitler had nothing to do with this operation; that it was all the work of General von Manstein. That is entirely false. Marshall von Manstein had indeed conceived the idea but when he submitted it to the joint Chiefs of Staff he was reprimanded, demoted and retired to Dresden. The General Staff had not brought this particular incident to Hitler's attention. On his own, Hitler ran a campaign along the same lines and routed the British-French forces. It was not until March 1940 that von Manstein came into contact with Hitler.\n\nThis a complete fabrication. Hitler, while not happy with the original general staff plan, was wiling to accept it. Manstein had conceived the plan to cut through the Ardennes, the plan was only accepted after he proposed it to Hitler. Hitler played no role in actually designing the plan. But apparently he was a military genius for going \"I like that, let's do that plan\". \n\n&gt; Hitler also planned the Balkan and Russian campaigns. On the rare occasions where Hitler allowed the General Staff to have their way, such as in Kursk, the battle was lost.\n\nAgain Hitler had no role in actually planning the military side of Operation Barbarossa, at this stage Hitler's MO was still to give basic goals and allow his generals to figure out how to reach them.\n\nAfter that it turns into a general history of the Waffen-SS and more bizarre Hitler fantasies, but I've covered the bulk of the Bad History here.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So first we see [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/26xt7t/hitler_and_generals_with_the_gustav_railroad_gun/) as the top comment below a photo of the lovely Schwerer Gustav: [+280]\n\n&gt;Has there ever been a Military force as innovative (relative to their enemies) as WWII Germany?\n\n&gt;Romans?\n\nThe innovative Wehrmacht! Is this same Wehrmacht as the one that still built tanks with [vertical armor plates](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-635-3965-05%2C_Panzerfabrik_in_Deutschland.jpg) in 1944? Or am I supposed to think that this 80cm howitzer, a super-sized version of an outdated World War I concept, is somehow innovative. They did want to make it into a [tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster), so I guess you could call that innovative. But I don't have time to compare lists of military inventions from different countries, so let's move on to the festering mass of comments in that thread.\n\n&gt;Germany had two fronts. Their ability to manufacture was easily bombed.\n\n&gt;If Germany had not attacked Russia and had an ally, a hypothetical Argentine Superpower with manufacturing and raw resources like the USA had, we'd all sprecha ze German.\n\n&gt;Actually, if Hitler had just left Stalin alone we might all like bratwurst.\n\n[Source](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/26xt7t/hitler_and_generals_with_the_gustav_railroad_gun/chvixe1) [+223]\n\nGermany did not lose the war because of bombing, and their manufacturing was actually [*not*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_armored_fighting_vehicle_production_during_World_War_II#Total_production) easily bombed as it didn't decrease until the Allies started literally taking over German territory. Aircraft production showed similar numbers, with 15,409 built in 1942, 24,807 in 1943 and 40,593 in 1944.^1\n\nAs to the second point, yes, if Germany hypothetically had lots of extra manufacturing, manpower and resources, they could have won. (This is also true for any country, such as Luxembourg.) However, if they actually did have a mega-powerful ally in, say, South America, there's no way in hell that any of the manufactured products would find their way to Germany in the first place across an entire ocean controlled by the Allies, so there's that. \n\nThe last point, that it would be so simple to just not attack the USSR, is not even likely; the Germans needed the resources and it wouldn't have stopped the US entry and subsequent successful end of the war.\n\n[Then we see how the problem with Germany's war effort was purely ideological:](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/26xt7t/hitler_and_generals_with_the_gustav_railroad_gun/chvnbq4) [+45]\n\n&gt;2.) Had Germany not fought a war with Nazi Ideology at its foundation they may have very well succeeded in their endeavor. The Soviet Union was massive during the onset of World War 2 however this was due to the fact that it was composed of many regions and people who did not take kindly to being subjected and did not WANT to be a part of Soviet Russia and greeted the invading Nazi's as liberators. Had they not subsequently subjected those people to the same treatment (if not worse) than how the Soviets treated them they not only steeled the resolve of the occupied to throw out Germany but lost out on the chance logistically speaking to gather immense amount of human resources, recruits and supplies. Not to mention how much resources they may have been able to redistribute if they weren't so busy corralling and killing \"undesirables.\"\n\nThat's an irrelevant side point really. Military resources didn't exist in the western USSR because they were destroyed by the retreating Soviets. The Germans did at times put foreigners into military units, but with mixed results. There were a lot of people in the captured Soviet territory, but it's not as simple as it sounds to build up a bunch of Slav armies and integrate them with yours *when they'd be fighting against their own country.* It's true that the Germans screwed up their own war effort by being rapists and murderers, but none of this would be significant enough to change the course of the war. It's grasping at straws to reach a desired conclusion, and it is bad to foster the notion that the outcome of wars and nations is really dependent upon small things like this rather than actual economic and political factors. That's why we see so much bad WWII alternate history in the first place. It's also bad history to think that all the partisanship and opposition to the Germans was merely reactive, as if the Soviets couldn't possibly be patriotic for their own sake.\n\nIn the same comment we learn that communism wouldn't real if Germany hadn't sent Lenin to Russia, and this sounds fishy but hopefully someone else can explain this part as I'm not so good on WWI lore.\n\nIn reply to this wisdom we see [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/26xt7t/hitler_and_generals_with_the_gustav_railroad_gun/chvnvxp) comment: [+15]\n\n&gt;The nazi ideology was the reason the germans were able to push their people so charismatically into war.\n\nAnother trope. The Germans weren't charismatic about war because of ideology, because when ideology was all they had (before WWII) on average the majority wasn't particularly charismatic about war. Let's see what happened in 1938 when Hitler tried to stir up a war fever prior to his planned invasion of Czechoslovakia:\n\n&gt;It turned out to be a terrible fiasco - at least for the Supreme Commander. The people of Berlin simply did not want to be reminded of war. In my diary that night I noted down the scene: \"There weren't 200 people at the Wilhelmsplatz, where Hitler stood on a balcony reviewing the troops. He looked grim, then angry, and soon went inside, leaving his soldiers to parade by unreviewed.\" ^2\n\nThey only started to care when the conflict was real and after they got a bunch of victories. The US, Britain, and the USSR didn't need Nazi ideology to be charismatic war, so I don't know why the Germans had to be different. So this is a bad-history counterpoint to the bad history, but it's a noble attempt to stem the tide of the Wehrmacht circlejerk, so [kudos for trying.](https://img0.etsystatic.com/010/0/7186166/il_570xN.419986258_a0ej.jpg)\n\nBut here we see that Reddit's favorite dictatorship could have won the war if only they had dispensed with the objectionable parts of their regime, and that is Bad History.\n\nsources:\n\n[1] *German Aircraft of World War 2 in Colour* by Kenneth Munson, page 12.\n\n[2] \"Hitler's Seizure of Europe\" by William L.

No, that isn't comon kno^w^l^e^d^g^e^? the Nazis broke the [German economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_ref-32) so badly they had no other choice than aggressive expansion and [asset seizure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht)? You're thinking of the policies of the not really a Nazi [Hjalmar Schacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Schacht). He was opposed to the rearmament plans and left the government in 1938. \n\nBut the rearmament was a terrible thing. Hitler's [Four-Year Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-Year_Plan)  forced him to move up his war plans. Let me quote you a passage from Evans' \"The Third Reich in Power\".\n\n&gt;The Reich's finances, which had recorded a modest surplus in 1932, recorded a deficit of 76 million Reichsmarks in 1933, rising to nearly 9.5 billion in 1938. Acting now in his capacity as President of the Reichsbank, Schacht wrote a personal letter to Hitler on 7 January 1939, signed by all the other directors of the Reichsbank, in which he warned that 'overstretching public expenditure' was rapidly leading to the 'looming danger of inflation.' 'The limitless expansion of state expenditure', they told Hitler, 'is destroying every attempt to put the budget in order. Despite an enormous tightening of the screw of taxation, it is bringing the finances of the state to the edge of ruin and from this position it is wrecking the bank of issue and its currency.' Hitler's response was to sack [Schacht] along with the entire board of directors a few days later, on 20 January 1939. He no longer fitted into the general National Socialist scheme of things, Hitler told Schacht.\n\n&gt;Unsurprisingly, what Schacht and his fellow directors ... had called the 'unrestrained spending habits of the public finances' continued unabated, at an even more frenetic temp than before. On 15 June 1939 a new law removed all limits on the printing of money, thus realizing Schacht's worst fears. But Hitler and Nazi leadership did not care. They were counting on the invasion and conquest of Eastern Europe to cover the costs. In February 1934 Hitler had stated that rearmament had to be complete by 1942. **By the time of the Four-Year Plan, the date had been moved forward to 1940. Germany's economic problems, as Hitler had always said, could only be definitively solved by war.**\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough I have originally jumped into the thread because I thought it was very amusing to see some bad history in a sub dedicated to making fun of people who think they are smart, but are in fact dumb, I have jumped out after checking out the users posting history (you can sort by 'controversial').\n\nI'm always a bit taken aback by this point of view. But, the user is a *literal fascist* **LITERAL FACIST**, so I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised.\n",

        "text": "So for those who may be unaware, Leon Degrelle was a Waffen SS soldier from the region of Wallonia in Belgium. He was a low level politician, who rose through the ranks of the Waffen SS before eventually fleeing to Spain where he lived out his days. He was admired greatly by Hitler and received heaps of awards and praise. \n\nAnyways, after his fleeing to Spain Degrelle wrote a number of essays on his time with Hitler and with the Waffen SS, now these are chock full of indoctrination and Bad History, these essays were to be included in a multi-volume book written in conjunction with IHR but they never got finished. I'm fully aware that this fruit is so low that its debut appearance was in “Journey to the Centre of the Earth” but these documents are extremely important to Neo-Nazis and Historical Revisionists alike (they are a favourite of the Institute for Historical Review) so I feel that they should be taken down; in these documents you can also find the beginning of many of the oft repeated Neo-Nazi myths. They're are three separate documents that I plan to do in three separate parts.\n\nThe one we will be doing here is called “the Enigma of Hitler”. Found [here]( http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v14/v14n3p22_Degrelle.html) It draws its name from the painting by Salvador Dali.\n\nWe are instantly greeted by this quote \n\n&gt; What a lesson in humility for the braying critics who have rushed into print since 1945 with their thousands of \"definitive\" books, most of them scornful, about this man who so troubled the introspective Dali that forty years later he still felt anguished and uncertain in the presence of his own hallucinatory painting. Apart from Dali, who else has ever tried to present an objective portrayal of this extraordinary man, who Dali labelled the most explosive figure in human history\n\nLook, there is something to be said for portraying Hitler accurately, but at the same time its hard to be objective about a man who tried to systematically exterminate several races of people and a man who initiated one of the bloodiest wars in human history. But furthermore its a false criticism. To see that one needs look no further than our own little slice of Heaven, r/badhistory. How often do we deal with Hitler revisionists, clean Wehrmacht proponents, etc... They're are tons of myths spread about Hitler that are regularly believed, how many times have you seen someone triumphantly proclaim “Hitler saved the economy” “Hitler was misunderstood” “Victors write the history books” and NOT get corrected. Its seems to me we have a problem with people being unable to view Hitler objectively, but that criticism goes both ways, which is something revisionists fail to understand. \n\nWe are than immediately treated to an evaluation of Hitler's character\n\n&gt; After 1945 Hitler was accused of every cruelty, but it was not in his nature to be cruel. He loved children. It was an entirely natural thing for him to stop his car and share his food with young cyclists along the road. Once he gave his raincoat to a derelict plodding in the rain. At midnight he would interrupt his work and prepare the food for his dog Blondi\n\nNot sure if Waffen SS colonel or Askreddit. \n\n\nLets take the two most problematic lines from that above quote. \n\n&gt; It was not in his nature to be cruel\n\nThis is entirely false. Hitler had a cruelty streak that very few dictators could rival. \n\nLets see how he dealt with the July Bomb Plotters, from Hitler by Ian Kershaw\n\n&gt; Once the verdicts had been pronounced, the condemned men were taken off, many of\nthem to Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. On Hitler’s instructions they were denied any last\nrites or pastoral care (though this callous order was at least partially bypassed in\npractice). The normal mode of execution for civilian capital offences in the Third Reich\nwas beheading. But Hitler had reportedly ordered that he wanted those behind the\nconspiracy of 20 July 1944 ‘hanged, hung up like meat-carcasses’. In the small, singlestorey\nexecution room, with whitewashed walls, divided by a black curtain, hooks,\nindeed like meat-hooks, had been placed on a rail just below the ceiling. Usually, the\nonly light in the room came from two windows, dimly revealing a frequently used\nguillotine. Now, however, certainly for the first groups of conspirators being led to their\ndoom, the executions were to be filmed and photographed, and the macabre scene was\nilluminated with bright lights, like a film studio. On a small table in the corner of the\nroom stood a table with a bottle of cognac – for the executioners, not to steady the\nnerves of the victims. The condemned men were led in, handcuffed and wearing prison\ntrousers. There were no last words, no comfort from a priest or pastor; nothing but the\nblack humour of the hangman. Eye-witness accounts speak of the steadfastness and\ndignity of those executed. The hanging was carried out within twenty seconds of the\nprisoner entering the room. Death was not, however, immediate. Sometimes it came\nquickly; in other cases, the agony was slow – lasting more than twenty minutes. In an\nadded gratuitous obscenity, some of the condemned men had their trousers pulled down\nby their executioners before they died. And all the time the camera whirred. The\nphotographs and grisly film were taken to Führer Headquarters. Speer later reported\nseeing a pile of such photographs lying on Hitler’s map-table when he visited the Wolf’s\nLair on 18 August.\n\nThat doesn't sound like someone not prone to cruelty, now does it?\n\nFor further evidence lets look at his policy towards the ethnically Polish areas of Poland\n\nPoland was to become an area of \n\n&gt; “hard ethnic struggle that will not permit any legal restrictions. The methods will not be compatible with our normal principals. “\n\nWhat about the Polish people?\n\n&gt; It was not the task of the administration to put the country on a sound basis economically and financially. There must be no opportunity for the Poles to reassert themselves. The standard of living in the country is to remain low; it is of use to us only as a reservoir of labour. “\n\nSo in other words the Polish are to be starved and worked to death, that's not cruel at all.\n\nFor one last bit of evidence lets look at how Hitler treated Soviet Commissars\n\n&gt; In the struggle against Bolshevism, we\nmust not assume that the enemy’s conduct will be based on principles of humanity or of\ninternational law. In particular, hate-inspired, cruel, and inhumane treatment of\nprisoners can be expected on the part of all grades of political commissars, who are the\nreal leaders of resistance … To show consideration to these elements during this\nstruggle, or to act in accordance with international rules of war, is wrong and\nendangers both our own security and the rapid pacification of conquered territory …\nPolitical commissars have initiated barbaric, Asiatic methods of warfare. Consequently,\nthey will be dealt with immediately and with maximum severity. As a matter of\nprinciple, they will be shot at once, whether captured during operations or otherwise\nshowing resistance.”\n\nSo in other words, kill everyone who disagrees with us politically. Fucking definition of mercy right there.\n\nNow the second statement\n\n&gt; Hitler loved Children\n\nFrom the Holocaust Encyclopedia \n\n&gt; The Germans and their collaborators killed as many as 1.5 million children, including over a million Jewish children and tens of thousands of Romani (Gypsy)children, German children with physical and mental disabilities living in institutions, Polish children, and children residing in the occupied Soviet Union. \n\nAfter a few paragraphs about his health and eating habits, we get to this quote. \n\n&gt; His behavior and his life style never changed even when he became the ruler of Germany. He dressed and lived frugally. During his early days in Munich, he spent no more than a mark per day for food. At no stage in his life did he spend anything on himself. Throughout his 13 years in the chancellery he never carried a wallet or ever had money of his own\n\nThis is complete horseshit. Hitler spent lavish amounts of money on bribes and on his own private estates. Hitler used state funds to build himself a private retreat, along with his famous house in the Alps. Hitler spent millions to buy the loyalty of politicians and especially the army. Lets use the words of Ian Kershaw\n\n&gt;  was happy to indulge the infinite craving for the material trappings\nof power and success of his underlings, aware that corruption on a massive scale\nensured loyalty as the Third Reich developed into a modern variant of a feudal system\nresting on personal allegiance rewarded by private fiefdoms. He himself, by now a\nmillionaire on the proceeds of sales of Mein Kampf, led his publicly acclaimed spartan\nlifestyle (as regards his food and clothing) in a context of untold luxury. Alongside his\nmagnificent apartments – his official one in Berlin and his private one in Munich – the\ninitially somewhat modest alpine residence, Haus Wachenfeld on the Obersalzberg, was\nnow converted at vast expense into the grandiose Berghof, suitable for state visits of\nforeign dignitaries. His restless energy demanded that he and his sizeable entourage\nwere almost constantly on the move within Germany. For that, a special train with\neleven coaches containing sleeping compartments, a fleet of limousines, and three\naeroplanes stood at his disposal\n\nAfter this we get more and more Hitler worship that borders on obsession. But that really can't be refuted. \n\nI'm sorry if this has been a little light on content, but this is just the beginning, as part two of Degrelle's writings on the origins of the Waffen-SS is chalked full of far more Bad History than this particular piece; I plan to do that in part 2.

        "text": "So, I've been looking for work as a tutor for this summer, since I've got no funding and I won't have teaching gigs until September. (I got the job I  interviewed for last week though! And, I got it while wearing a Canadian Tuxedo.) As a preliminary step to interviewing for tutoring jobs, a private test-prep company gave me sample SAT tests in verbal skills, US history, and world history. I killed the verbal portion. Out of well over a hundred questions, there were only one or two that I wasn't sure of. The history tests, on the other hand... \n\nThey were a disaster. It was a strange experience, because taking these tests made me feel both intellectual superior and stupid all at once. The questions ranged from laughably vague (How did the colonists feel about...?) to ridiculously detailed (Who led the Ottoman armies at the siege of whatever random city?), and some of the questions clearly had no right answer. One asked who \"established\" Geocentrism, and then gave five choices: Galileo, Kepler, Brahe, Copernicus, and Newton. Rule 5: None of those guys \"established\" geocentrism in any way that I know of. Another asked who the \"worst\" Mughal emperor was. Rule 5: This is a purely subjective judgment about the quality and nature of emperorship; there are many ways a ruler could be \"worst,\" including being most morally bankrupt in a universal sense in which the preservation of human life and freedom is held as the universal moral standard; being most deviant from the moral standards of the Mughal empire at the time of his rule; being ineffective. Without clarification, the question has no obvious answer.\n\nBut the test got into WTF territory with its cartography. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/lUYsrfe.jpg) the worst example. I don't even know what to say about it, just look at it and tell me what the hell is going there. [This one](http://i.imgur.com/be75qGQ.jpg) is slightly less fantastical than the first, but still about as poorly designed as a map could be. Rule 5: Maps should come from actual mapmakers, and not the globes for sale at Cost Plus. And the worst thing about it that this was the OFFICIAL PRACTICE TEST published by the College Board (or whoever does the SAT subject exams) EDIT: SEE BELOW. It was an absolute shit show, and when I pointed out to the woman giving the test that some questions didn't have right answers provided, she just looked at me blankly and said, \"That's the official test.\" \n\nBut, I feel stupid because I just didn't know a lot of the \"answers.\" I think it was largely due to the content of the test. The US history one was substantially better than the world history one; both were low quality, but the world history test was just a joke. In terms of content, it was basically Western Civ c. 1970s plus political histories of various \"civilizations,\" and a bit about the Cold War in Latin America. Thinking about it, I don't think there was a single question dealing with what we might consider a world-historical process; instead, it was all about kings and emperors. And, to be honest, I thought it would be something like that, but I didn't think I'd do as poorly as I did. I guess my knowledge of Ottoman sultans is really bad. \n\nNeedless to say, they haven't called me back.\n\nEDIT: So, [here's](http://books.google.com/books?id=UvdUMaLsQM0C&amp;dq=the+darkly-shaded+area+in+the+map+above+reflects+the+boundaries+of+which+empire+in+the+thirteenth+century&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s) a google books link to the test book, so it turns out that this is NOT published by the College Board, but is in fact done by a private company. The questions discussed in this thread are visible in the preview if you search. \n\n\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/26s5eq/pistolfist_where_setting_a_comic_book_in_the/",
        "text": "It has been a helluva long time since I've done a review on here, so I thought I would jump into an incredibly niche subject: the American Revolution in comic books.\n\nA bit of background first. Some years ago I authored a paper on the American Revolution in popular culture as a whole. This was after [The Patriot](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1iozh6/the_patriot_and_slavery/), but right before [John Adams](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1ut0kw/john_adams_join_or_die_bad_history_great_hollywood/), [Assassin's Creed 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1fy2kd/assassins_creed_iii_charles_lee_looks_like_an_80s/), [Sleepy Hollow](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1qjg4g/sleepy_hollow_bad_history_bad_literature_and_bad/), and [Turn](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/22f79m/amcs_turn_a_nitpicking_review/), so there really wasn't a lot to work with at the time. Even if [The British Are Cumming](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1j7l8n/nsfw_the_british_are_cumming_pt_1_its_like_they/) had been released, I wouldn't dare put it into an academic paper.\n\nI turned to comic books, and found that there were a few of them out there. Today I'll be talking about *Pistolfist*, an independent comic released by [Bluewater Productions](http://www.bluewaterprod.com/comics/pistolfist.php) in 2008. As a sidenote, this company now releases poorly illustrated celebrity bio comics, including Justin Bieber and Tim McGraw.\n\nThankfully, this piece has better artwork, and the premise is (at least initially) intriguing. Crispus Attucks, the famous African-American and possibly also Native American sailor/laborer, is killed at the Boston Massacre. Little is known historically about this real life figure, so the creators of *Pistolfist* create a fictional brother who vows to take revenge on the British.\n\nThe reason this premise works is that there is a lot of room for creative license. Because Crispus is such a shadowy figure two centuries on, you have a lot of wiggle room to make up a backstory without obvious contradictions. Removing it further by creating a brother gives you even more room. Add to that the dynamics offered by having a character that can legitimately represent two minority groups torn asunder by the war and you have a lot of potential for dynamic storytelling and fascinating drama.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't any of that. This issue is his origin story. Let's dig right into it!\n\nThe [first issue](http://imgur.com/VCMtsu5) begins at the Battle of Lexington, because of course it does. The Americans are being overrun by a stream of redcoats, and all seems lost until a masked rider appears on the battlefield! The first problem is that he speaks like he's a Shakespearean actor. It plagues the entire issue with lots of overly flowery words that don't really lend themselves to the period. It's a small nitpick, but it bugs me.\n\nHilariously, the hero begins his story much like Boba Fett: he looks cool and accomplishes nothing. Salem (his name, but we don't learn that for a while) jumps into a line of redcoats and [punches one in the mouth, then tries to sound ominous](http://imgur.com/73vJJQv) before being completely [overwhelmed and captured](http://imgur.com/wCOEaZ6) without really doing anything else. So his entire contribution to this massive battle is a minor wound to a single British soldier? That's kinda lame.\n\nThe British uniforms are atrocious. Red waistcoats were acceptable for light infantry, which is what I assume these guys are supposed to be, since they have tall leather caps and \"wings\" sewn onto the shoulders of their coats. They have very odd white wigs (WHY ARE THEY ALWAYS WHITE?) with these weird curls that loop around behind the head. None of them has queues (ponytails) either. Unfortunately, the artist chose to represent the 10th Regiment of Foot, as shown by the Roman numeral \"X\" on their caps. The 10th is a good choice. They were heavily involved at Lexington and Concord. But their uniforms were red with yellow facings on the lapels, cuffs, and collar, not blue. Blue designated a royal regiment, like the Coldstream Guards or Royal Welsh Fusiliers.\n\nHere's where things start to veer wildly off the rails. The prisoners of Lexington and Concord are taken to [Fort Ticonderoga](http://imgur.com/oazjQjo). Why? Why would you do that? Is it just because the name sounds cool and you knew it had something to do with the Revolution?\n\nBritish troops retreated from the battle into Boston, where they were besieged by the colonials. Any and all prisoners taken would remain there, or have to be shipped out of the city by water. If, by some miracle, they broke out of the siege, sending prisoners to a fort two hundred and twenty miles away would not have been a priority. Here's a handy [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Boston,+MA/Fort+Ticonderoga,+30+Fort+Ti+Rd,+Ticonderoga,+NY+12883/@43.103661,-72.8010212,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e3652d0d3d311b:0x787cbf240162e8a0!2m2!1d-71.0597732!2d42.3584308!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cb555da3dd364bd:0x70da98c07bf2f773!2m2!1d-73.38754!2d43.841677) to illustrate that. Even on modern roads and with modern transportation, it's a haul. It is possible that they could have sent prisoners out by water, as the Royal Navy still controlled the bay, but then they would have to ship the prisoners all the way up to the St. Lawrence River, and down through the Great Lakes to upstate New York.\n\nJust as importantly, Ticonderoga would remain in British hands for only a very short while after Lexington and Concord. Within a month it was captured by American troops under Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. The reason the fort was taken so easily is that the British garrison there was unaware a war was even on. How the hell could they accept prisoners from the war and not know there was a war? It's a silly diversion, and is coupled with the usual cartoonishly villainous British doing cartoonishly villainous things like randomly imprisoning women and children. Moral ambiguity, an excellent storytelling device being well used by other examples of popular media (*Assassin's Creed 3* and *Turn,* for example) and perfectly illustrated by this conflict, is totally absent.\n\nThis action is all broken up with a plodding B-plot involving Benjamin Franklin returning to America, and is only made somewhat interesting by the inclusion of what I can only conclude must be [Anne of Green Gables.](http://imgur.com/NlDQ6DV) The high collar, puffed up shoulders, piled up hair, and even her jewelry positively *scream* Edwardian. 18th century fashion is, frankly, more revealing. As my wife often states, the neckline of eighteenth century gowns is [just about where the bra line sits](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cTxbX0g2tTk/UGPdbx2QLzI/AAAAAAAAAk4/X-1ND2GXy6Y/s1600/Mrs+Russell+nee+Cox+by+JohnSmart+1781.jpg). Granted, women often wore neckerchiefs to cover up the cleavage, but not always. Why pass up the opportunity to show some boobies?\n\nThe punchline comes in the second issue (of which I do not own a copy) where the British attach a superweapon to his wrist that shoots lightning. That's...actually pretty cool. But why give it to the guy who swore on his life to defeat you? It's typical supervillain logic (or lack thereof) and not really bad history, it just bugs me.\n\nThe second issue also features a flashback to the Boston Massacre, where the main antagonist is introduced: Montgomery. Not a bad choice, as he was one of only two soldiers actually convicted at the trials that followed the Massacre, but he's also just a private. The creators of this comic decided to promote him to Lieutenant. Oh, and they also show us a Native American village of the Northeast, which is inexplicably populated by tepees on what is clearly a plain in the American Midwest. Northeasten nations typically lived in longhouses, not tepees. It's your cliched popular culture coalescing of Native Americans into a single autonomous entity, but it's a tired trope. The native warriors are shown in familiar Plains Indians garb, rather than the [awesomely badass](http://www.history.org/almanack/people/bios/images/step2.jpg) paint and dress of the *actual* Northeastern nations. This is one helluva missed opportunity.\n\nIn the end, *Pistolfist* is a bizarre piece that makes no real attempt at history. As put by an artist friend of mine, superhero comics set in the past often use it only as set dressing, and rarely does it actually contribute anything to the story. Why even put this in the Revolution? What has the character or story gained from that? Couldn't this have worked better in a fantasy setting with muskets?\n\n*EDIT: Got a few links mixed up. Should be sorted out now!*",

A Socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his personal efficiency. Our adopted term ‘Socialist has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not. Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false.” \n\n-Adolf Hitler in the *Sunday Express*, September 28th, 1930. \n\n*****\n\n&gt; Nazism is hard to classify as a concrete ideology because so many of its tenets and practices are paradoxical, this being one. Originally, there was an actual national-socialist wing in the Nazi party under the Strasser brothers who wanted a German Nationalist socialism, but after the Night of Long knives (when they were purged) that element survived only in the name of the party. The Strasserites were the closest thing in the Nazi party to actual socialism; they wanted socialism, but only for the German people, and they were still virulently opposed to communism.\n\n&gt; Other than that, the \"socialist\" aspect of National Socialism was merely a political tool used by Hitler and Goebbels to mobilize the working classes to support them; while they condemned communism to get support from the middle class, they also condemned bourgeois democracy to get support from the workers. Hitler's own ideas on his version of socialism were incredibly vague, saying something along the lines of \"I believe a socialist is one who loves Germany with his heart\" (terrible misquote, but I've misplaced my copy of \"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" ATM). I believe his creation of limited working class welfare had more in common with Bismarck's strategy of cutting support for revolutionary movements than sincere socialistic ideology. Part of the reason unemployment amongst German workers fell is because the Nazis banned women from the workplace, giving their jobs to men; aside from that, the conditions of the working class generally deteriorated during Nazi rule. Independent trade unions were banned, and replaced with the German Labour Front, who in true corporatist fashion served more as an intermediary on the side of the bosses than a workers' organization. By the late 1930s, wages actually dropped, and the cost of living rose by something like 25%.\n\n&gt; Basically, Hitler never threatened the machinations of capitalism in Europe like legitimate socialist ideology did. While the regime targeted Jewish shop owners etc., their German compatriots often profited from their removal. Later on, slave labour from concentration camps was used in privately owned factories and on privately owned land. Fascism was a political force based in middle-class opposition to communism, while revolutionary socialism was an ideology aimed at destroying or directing capitalism to the benefit of the working class. Fascists used leftist terminology and methods with one hand to try and gain proletarian support, while crushing genuine leftists with the other.\n\n[Source.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sipie/to_what_extent_was_the_national_socialist_german/c4eepc8)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; You have it all wrong. German's industrialists loved Hitler. He kept the working class in check with false promises, state sponsored basically fake labor unions and creation of external enemies. He ramped up production of weapons and infrastructure, which the capitalists also loved. Look at Krupp, for example.\n\n&gt; From the article:\n\n&gt;    Gustav and especially Bertha were initially skeptical of Hitler, who was not of their class. Gustav's skepticism toward the Nazis waned when Hitler dropped plans to nationalize business\n\n&gt; There you have the main difference. Both fascism and 'communism' are totalitarian, but fascism is friendly to the existing elites.\n\n&gt; One can also argue that the Sowiet system was not real socialism, since the working class was fucked anyway and the Bolsheviks only replaced one ruling elite with another, and real socialism would be based on bottom-up organization of working people in unions etc., which was systematically crushed at the beginning of the 20th century. But this will of course lead to a shitstorm of arguing over the definition of words.\n\n[Source.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11b114/if_the_nazisfacists_were_socialists_albeit_racist/c6kvbnt)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; German historian (and a socialist) so it pains me to say that this one DOES have a kernel of truth to it, which makes it more difficult to explain in simple terms. There was a wing of the Nazi party that did actually take the \"socialism\" part of their name seriously and tried to recruit the same working class young people that the communists did. The Strasser brothers (Gregor and Otto) were the most important leaders of this \"left wing\" of the party, and Roehm was in there as well. The Nazis also worked with the communists in the Berlin transit strike.\n\n&gt; However, Hitler himself was definitely in the \"conservative wing\" of the party and he obviously won. One of the Strassers was murdered in 1934 as Hitler purged the party of its left wing. The main Nazis who emerged in power, with the exception of Goebbels, who switched from the Strasser faction to Hitler, didn't have any attachment to socialism whatsoever and worked hand-in-hand with big business.\n\n&gt; Really the name of the party itself was just a grab bag of random crap to attract voters.\n\n&gt;&gt; Early on, they were definitely what we would call \"socialist.\" When the NSDAP was created, they released a 25-point program that did include many stipulations and demands that were recognized as socialist, including state ownership of land (point 17) and redistribution of capital (point 14).\n\n&gt;&gt; The Nazis then proceeded to enact precisely none of those policies when they had control of the government. All the socialist demands dropped off completely and the nationalist ones became the party platform - the part about citizenship being restricted to the German race (read: not Jews) and demands of land/territory for expansion (Lebensraum).\n\n&gt;&gt; Usually, people identifying the Nazis as socialist aren't concerned with historical contingency, though. The argument always goes: \"The Nazis were socialist. The Nazis were evil. Ergo, socialism is evil.\" One of the easiest ways I find to dissuade that kind of lazy thinking is by pointing out that the Social Democrats and the communists were the Nazis' principal targets for arrest and harassment in the mid-1930s. Hitler hated left-wing groups almost as much as he hated Jews, believing the former was an idea of the latter (hence the overuse of the phrase \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" in Nazi rhetoric).\n\n[Source.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1oval1/rebuttals_to_the_nazis_were_socialists_arguments/ccw27fg)\n\n*****\n\n&gt;There was no longer anyone inside the party who disputed Hitler's unlimited authority. Even Gregor Strasser accepted it for the time being and became, as the chief of the central office of organization, one of the party's most influential leaders. His brother Otto, who continued to adhere to a Germanic form of Socialism, was forced to leave the party with a handful of adherents, to form a splinter group, the 'Black Front'. To one of the doubters Hitler shouted in 1930: 'What is Socialism? A Jewish invention to set the German people by the ears!' And in the Sunday Express he wrote at about the same time: 'Our adopted term \"Socialist\" has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.' \n\n[Source.](http://books.google.com/books?id=UmpULJEnma0C&amp;q=page+137#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20front&amp;f=false)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasserism\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Front\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Position\n\nBut of course, Hitler was an ardent feminist. So maybe he was a socialist after all. Not to mention his fervent support of LGBT rights. It seems Hitler is a clearly a socialist by anyone's definition! \n\nYou could always ask the fine folks of [/r/NationalSocialism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/),\n\n&gt; The free market is the most expedient method of societal innovation, we believe this at our core. We would not replace one economic bureaucracy with another one. However we must reform the massive web of Regulation/Permits/Licenses that bottleneck our industries and creates artificial monopolies on our markets by subversion.\n\n&gt; Every National Socialist, who struggles in this Judeo-Bolshevik system, knows the difference between welfare pits, and Americans genuinely in need.\n\n&gt; If we end our wars, and focus on our infrastructure, we can easily rid ourselves of our over-the-top social welfare through attrition. We should cut or eliminate the Income Tax, and put the money back into the pockets of Americans, in a true free market we have the power with our dollar who succeeds and who fails. Not a monopoly of jewish bankers, and their goyim frontmen who prostrate before AIPAC before being anointed our \"leaders\".\n\nHoly shit, they sound just like AnCaps! \\#EndtheFed \\#NoTrueFreeMarket So obviously this means AnCaps are literally Nazis, who are literally Socialists, who is literally FDR, who is literally Hitler, wait no we already got to him, who is literally Lincoln. \n\nNow if you excuse me I have to catch my flight to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because I'm sick of this sad excuse for democracy we have in America. \n\nEDIT: It appears the Fascist/Socialist mods have awarded this post with a high effort flair, I shall accept my award graciously although Bitcoin donations are preferred. \n\n",

One of my friends referred to it yesterday, however, while we were revising for our early modern history exam later this week, and I couldn't resist digging it up again. Be warned: this is *really* low hanging fruit.\n\nWe start with the claim that a \"shocking new theory about Elizabeth I\" has been \"unearthed in historic manuscripts\". You'll have to remember this claim, because we'll take a while to get to it.\n\nFirst, we hear that one morning, at an unspecified (as of yet), Henry VIII was going to visit Elizabeth, when she died of fever. \n\n&gt; Elizabeth’s governess, Lady Kat Ashley, and her guardian, Thomas Parry, had good reason to fear telling the king this awful news. It would cost them their lives.\n\nUm, no. Henry wasn't stupid. Death as a child was reasonably common in early modern England, and neither Ashley or Parry would have been expected to save Elizabeth's life in any case. They were guardians, not doctors.\n\n&gt; The ten-year-old Elizabeth was Tudor England’s most valuable child in many ways. She could surely be married to a French or Spanish prince to seal an international alliance — and her own children would secure the Tudor dynasty Henry so desperately craved. \n\nWell, you know, apart from Henry's *son and heir*, Edward. The Daily Mail claims that Edward was a sickly child, but that view is extremely outdated: when he was born, he was described as a healthy baby, and a year after this visit was allegedly set (Edward, we are told, was five when this happened), Henry described him as 'the kingdom's most precious jewel'. Thinking that Elizabeth was particularly important is gross presentism.\n\nJust because we know that Elizabeth would outlive her siblings and be remembered as a Good Queen(tm), doesn't mean Henry did. In fact, at this point, Elizabeth was a Lady, not a princess, and had been removed from the line of succession because of Anne Boleyn's crimes. \n\n&gt; Treason stuff\n\nOkay, this is nitpicky compared to the rest, but as a woman, Kat Ashley would have been burned at the stake for treason, not hanged drawn and quartered. Not to mention that she hadn't committed a crime, and whatever else Henry was, he did operate within the laws of the realm.\n\n&gt; Their only chance of concealing the truth, and perhaps buying themselves a few days to flee the country, was to trick the king.\n\nWays to avoid not being executed because you haven't committed a crime: commit a serious crime (one which arguably *was* treason, in fact). And trusting your life to a ten year old boy? Really?\n\n&gt; But after he left later that afternoon, the hoax began in earnest. Parry and Lady Ashley realised that if they ever admitted what they had done, the king’s fury would be boundless. They might get out of the country to safety, but their families would surely be killed.\n\nOnce again, Henry was an absolute ruler, but he did operate within the law. So no. They might however lose their lands, as the family of traitors.\n\n&gt; the many corroborating details around this extraordinary tale about the Bisley boy were enough to convince the 19th-century writer Bram Stoker\n\nOh, well it must be true, then.\n\n&gt;  it was the most plausible explanation  why Elizabeth, who succeeded to  the throne in 1558, aged 25,  never married. \n\nOh, for god's sake. Explain, then, why there were at least four plausible candidates for marriage with Elizabeth, two of them Elizabeth was personally interested in marrying. She even wrote Francis of Valois a love-poem when she broke off their courtship, for heaven's sake. \n\n&gt; yet she described herself as a Virgin Queen, and vowed she would never take a husband\n\nTrue, but only once she was too old to conceive, and so the major reason she might marry -- to stabilise the succession -- was moot.\n\n&gt; American author Steve Berry believes Elizabeth could have been telling the literal truth — that she had the heart of a man, because her body was male. He has spent 18 months researching the conspiracy for his novel The King’s Deception, a Dan Brown-style thriller set in 21st-century London.\n\nWait, what? The Daily Mail are basing what they claim to be history on the beliefs of a novelist who writes 'Dan Brown-style' thrillers!? Okay, it's the Mail, but even so.\n\n&gt; tantalising hints and references in books and ancient manuscripts.\n\nRemember those manuscripts we were promised 3000 words ago? Me neither.\n\n&gt; ‘The constitution of her mind,’ Ascham wrote, ‘is exempt from female weakness, and she is embued with a masculine power of application … In the whole manner of her life she rather resembles Hippolyte than Phaedra.’\n\nRoger Ascham ascribing to the idea that women are mentally weak is understandable. The Daily Mail apparently still believing it, less so.\n\n&gt; One picture exists of Elizabeth as a child, attributed to the court painter William Scrots. She had slender shoulders, a delicate neck and a heart-shaped face with ginger hair and eyebrows.\n\n&gt; In the next known portrait, shortly after she was crowned queen, her broad shoulders and neck are disguised with heavy furs. She is wearing a wig, and her eyebrows are plucked bare. Her jaw is heavy and square.\n\n&gt; All subsequent pictures of the queen were painted to an ideal, showing Elizabeth as she wished to be seen, not as she was. \n\nMost portraits of Elizabeth depicted an ideal rather than reality. Wow.\n\n&gt;  Certainly, Cecil was surprisingly stoic about the queen’s determination never to wed. \n\nWas he? Have you read the same biographies of Elizabeth that I have, Daily Mail?\n\nThere's just so much wrong in this article, this is only a selection of the highlights. I leave the rest as an exercise to the reader...",

As we all know, many monks were responsible for copying works, then you had people like Roger Bacon who was a friar and well noted scientist. There are many others of course.\n\n&gt; Along with that, Christian monks had scraped off the ink of the paper that had contained many different works from many different scientists of the ancient world just to get the paper to write out Bibles.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/26kgg9/do_you_ever_wonder_how_advanced_we_could_be/chs067j\n\n[I can think of one occasion this happened off the top of my head, and it wasn't for a Bible either.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest)\n\n&gt;I'm not talking about the church being the only reason for our lack of progress, but they're certainly a huge part since they were in complete control of Western civilization for about a thousand years.

        "text": "[Here](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/26lnko/viking_expansion_from_the_8th_to_11th_centuries/) we can see an otherwise (as far as I can tell) pretty good map of Viking expansion throughout the Middle Ages. I do take one issue with this (and it's pretty pedantic, admittedly):\n\nThe yellow markers (noted as 11th century) aren't really Viking expansion. They're Norman expansion. This might seem overly semantical, but the Scandinavians who settled in Normandy quickly assimilated into the local culture, interbreeding, picking up the local tongue, and converting to Christianity. By the time of the Norman conquests of England and southern Italy, Normandy was a decidedly singular nation of people, and Scandinavians accounted for a significant minority of the population.\n\n**EDIT: I've been corrected. I forgot that Cnut the Great's territory extended to the entirety of England in the 11th century. However, the point stands for Mediterranean territory.**\n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/jznjhPF) is a map of territory attributed to Norman expansion. As you can see, this lines up almost perfectly with the territory attributed to vikings in the original map. Marc Morris, in his book *The Norman Conquest*, goes into rather vivid detail with regards to the extent of Norman assimilation in conquered cultures. Normandy was settled by Vikings around the turn of the 9th century, and by the time of the Norman conquest of England, Scandinavian cultural identity had all but vanished from the region. It's even more rapid in England. After 1066, Norman colonialism was brutal in its expansion through England, displacing natives at a shocking rate. Within William's lifetime, multiple local and regional courts were convened to alleviate some of the pain and take back lands seized illegally (that is, lands that were seized from people who weren't actively opposing William's reign). The success of these courts was mixed, but they were certainly unprecedented at the time, and the data from these courts, as well as data gathered by agents of the crown, ultimately became what we now know as the Domesday book.\n\nI'm digressing, but I'm just trying to illustrate how the Normans were not particularly concerned with their national and cultural identities outside of practicality. The people that we know of as English today are arguably as much French/Norman/Angevin as they are Anglo-Saxon or Briton. The same applied to the Norse peoples who colonized Normandy. By the time they expanded out of France, they considered themselves Norman, not Scandinavian or Vikings. \n\nAttributing Norman conquests to vikings would be like attributing the USA's westward expansion to England. Certainly there are genetic and cultural ties, but they are an altogether different people. \n\nAgain, perhaps I'm being pedantic, but when we're dealing with medieval western Europe (specifically west Francia) -- a place in which national and ethnic identities were relatively fluid -- I think the distinction is important.\n\nI hope this is an adequate R5. I don't know how to quote an image :(",

Technically (and still a matter of great tension and debate) it was declared a republic by W.T Cosgrave in an unprecedented and unexpected announcement in 1919 but only the Russian Republic acknowledged it.\n\nThe UK being left as none is wrong; first of all the UK is not a country, it is a union of three separate countries, all of which were invade and subjugated at one point or another and secondly, the presumed intent of the poster to assign England as the UK further confuses matters as England has had a long history of invasions and subjugations.\n\nItaly was never subordinate to the WW2 Allies as Italy changed sides near the end and were counted amongst the victors.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro were not subjugated under Yugoslavia, they were the countries that were formed after Yugoslavia split.\n\nCzechoslovakia peacefully separated into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. They were once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nIraq was never subjugated by the United states, they were (as /u/freeogy said) invaded and occupied but no actual subjugation took place.\n\nI don't know enough about other countries to confidently expose them, hopefully other will add their accurate histories and I will update this with credit where credit is due.\n\nBonus: [OP admits to using wikipedia as their only source](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/26lg37/european_countries_last_subordination_oc_png/chs94eu)",

        "text": "I figure we need a thread to cover this admittedly amazingly entertaining show. Things I've noticed so far:\n\n*  They use prop rifles quite liberally. Patton is first shown drawing a bead on a Villista with an SMLE Mk III, and British soldiers are depicted with 1903 Springfield pattern rifles. The Germans aren't much better, using both in addition to their Gewehr 98 Mausers, as well as a liberal helping of not real prop guns. Mussolini's use of a Carcano carbine did make me unreasonably giddy.\n\n* Patton's tanks are mostly Renault FTs, which would've been very accurate. However, there must not be any running Renault FTs or replicas around, since Patton is depicted as riding on a tank (which is a questionable tactical decision). The tank he's riding looks to be an M2 light tank, which wasn't developed until 1935.\n\n~~* Churchill is depicted as leading a charge \"over the top\" at one point. He is carrying a 1911. While I've heard that British officers in WWI furnished their own sidearms, I haven't necessarily heard that they often used or had access to American pistols. The trope, I guess, is that mustachioed British gentlemen charged into battle with a good, solid Webley Mk VI.~~  \nI was originally unsure of this point, and it seems to have been correct. Churchill did carry a 1911.\n\n* I have no information on the uniforms, since that's not really my area of expertise. Perhaps /u/Samuel_Gompers could examine them?\n\n* The general history seems pretty good, with some interesting deviations. They compress a lot, such as the Gallipolli campaign (you'd think it took a day or two from the show, when it actually took eight months). The Germans of WWI are depicted as sending Lenin to Russia to destabilize the government, where he meets up with Stalin and storms the Winter Palace. In reality, he was still in exile in Zurich when he heard of the abdication of the Tsar and had to jump through some diplomatic hoops to be allowed to pass through Europe to get back to Russia. His revolutionary activities would be against the Provisional Government, not the Tsar. \n\n\nI'm quite excited for the continuation of the series, and everybody should post things here for further discussion as they come up.",

He is likely thinking of the Emancipation Proclamation which freed slaves in the rebellious states, but not in the slave states that remained a part of the Union such as Maryland and Delaware. The Thirteenth Amendment, once passed and ratified appropriately, banned slavery in any and all US states, regardless of their status as a former confederate state. \n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment reads:\n\n&gt; Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\nSection 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\nThis clearly leaves no allowance for Union slave states and does not target Confederate or former Confederate states. \n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/26jmqi/til_that_mississippi_only_just_ratified_the_13th/chrvwzk\n\n**Edit:** Better R5 and grammar",

Hebrew was the liturgical and sometimes literary language of first-century Judea, to be sure, but the dominant language was Aramaic and we know from the Targums that most people needed Aramaic translation and glosses to understand the Hebrew Bible. More importantly, this kind of statement badly understates how important Aramaic was. Aramaic(or rather the Aramaic dialect continuum) was the major lingua franca of the Middle East from the late Neo-Assyrian Empire to the rise of Islam, it was the administrative language of Achaemenid and to a notable extent Selucid Iran, it was the main liturgical and literary language of Talmudic Judaism and of most Near Eastern Christianity outside of the Nile basin and the Caucasus(and even there Syriac literature was a major influence on Armenian christianity), and was generally fairly high up on the Languages You Want to Know list. To make a mistake like this betrays a very clear tendency to ignore very important aspects of first-century Palestine and late antiquity. I could go on and on and on here but that's the basics.

        "text": "[So there's this picture, actually sort of interesting.](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/26h6bc/wehrmacht_soldiers_having_a_snowball_fight_in/)\n\nBut of course, any time we have pictures that humanize Nazis, there's those people who shows up and tries to argue that the Nazis weren't that bad.\n\nWe jump straight into the action:\n\n&gt;Generally speaking the Wehrmacht were regular soldiers who served with distinction and honor. It's the SS who did the real evil shit. These guys weren't that bad.\n\nI'm just gonna use [/u/Samuel_Gomper's refutation of this from the wiki ](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1v9zsd/ultrapopular_german_ww2_action_film_tries_to/ceq98pc?context=4) because I like to save time. \n\nPlus, here's some nice pictures of these Rommelesquely good Wehrmacht guys! \n\n[Here we see a nice Wehrmacht guy being super honorable and distinct.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/22/article-2206982-1522EA78000005DC-671_634x349.jpg)\n\n[Candid Wehrmacht selfie time!](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/22/article-2206982-1522EA94000005DC-817_634x383.jpg)\n\n[Wehrmacht hard at work ~~killing Jews~~ serving with distinction](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/The_Bochnia_massacre_German-occupied_Poland_1939.jpg)\n\nBut we have only scratched upon the surface of this terrible cesspit.\n\nSomeone brings up the [mass rape commited by the Wehrmacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht#Mass_rapes) as a counter to their \"innocence,\" and guess how our nice apologist friend responds? \n\n&gt;Rape was prevalent among all soldiers of all nations during WWII and has been forever. I'm not condoning but it was common among all.\n\n\"Everyone commited rape, therefore rape is not a war crime!\"\n\nThen, we delve into the lengthy paragraphs of bullshit that are spun by the neo nazi backup brigade:\n&gt;There were certainly horrible soldiers in the Wehrmacht, and it was a breeding ground for cruelty. But think about it, these men had been indoctrinated for years to hate Jewish people. Not just that, if you watch a documentary with interviews of SS or Wehrmacht men, they will say that one of the main reasons they joined was because they wanted the Nordic/Germanic countries to team together to wipe out Communism and Bolshevism. Once they arrived at the front, the war was extremely harsh and they were almost always low on food, gas, and clothing. I watched one interview with Wiking SS men where they were so cold, one guy goes 'negativ 54 Grad und kein Fell' negative 54 and no coat. Later in the documentary the same guy says how when a Russian guy jumped on him he killed him by biting his throat. The severity of the situation just amplified their hatred. This was compounded by the fact that orders such as the Night and Fog Decree, the Barbarossa Decree, the Commissar Order and The Severity Order specifically told soldiers essentially that it was their job to slaughter as many Jews/partisans as they could. One of the main ways in which people were forced to commit executions was by firing squads, where they would observe for anyone who did not participate in the shooting. SS Police divisions existed in part to arrest or hang people for insubordination. It's a lot less black and white than it seems\n\nTo claim that the Wehrmacht is not to blame for their antisemitism because they were indoctrinated to be antisemitic is absolute hogwash. Also, I find it amazing how he thinks experience on the front  justifies war crimes. Clearly a Nuremburg defense \n\nSomeone makes a nice long refutation of the whole argument, and then, it is responded to by this:\n\n&gt;I understand that the Wehrmacht had a terrible function, what I'm saying is what's the average soldier going to do, \"We're putting these civilians in a church and burning the church, you stand guard' 'No man fuck you, I'm not doing that', how would that go? In the final days of Berlin they found people hanging everywhere who were everywhere from children to old men who refused service of deserted. The Nazis used propaganda to get the power from the German people and used that same power to twist their arms into doing horrible things. I certainly agree that the Wehrmacht had a overarching negative impact by far, but it's a group of 18 million men, do you really think there's anything specifically evil about those people's nature compared to others? Maybe with the Waffen SS you have a group that you could make a broad statement about their characters with because they were a smaller group and ideologically chosen.\n\nI don't even know what to say. Like, he has this insane disconnect between the Nazis and the Germans. the Nazis were Germans. The Wehrmacht were the ones burning the barns. It wasn't some random entity coming over and saying \"you must burn the barn!\", it was the Wehrmacht itself that decided to burn the barn, and it was the Wehrmacht that carried it out. He acts as if the Nazis were some foreign entity that no German had the ability to refuse or disagree with. To claim the Wehrmacht is not bad because they are so large is also silly. Nazi  Germany had 70 million people, but does this mean Nazi Germany wasn't bad? No. Nazi Germany is the most reviled nation in modern history. Size doesn't dilute the intensity of the hatred and destruction that came out of the Wehrmacht. \n\nFinally, it's time to compare the nazis to Vietnam-era US army!\n\n&gt;&gt;And even if they did serve honorably, they still served an institution that launched numerous wars of aggression and abetted in the most horrific genocide in recorded history.\n\n&gt;This is every American soldier from vietnam forward. There are monsters in every army. This does not excuse it at all, but it is the winners who do the prosecutions.\n\nThose evil US Soldiers, helping the Nazis kill the Jews in 1969 Vietnam! 40 years of US soldiers helped to cause the holocaust ex post facto! Also, it seems that our good friend Victor has started dabbling in criminal law!\n\nThat's all for now. ",

        "text": "Hello all, \n\nSo I did some digging and did not see this come up on this sub. I decided i'd do a formal break down of the movie The Last Legion, which is based off of an Italian book of the same name by Valerio Massimo Manfredi. \n\nNow before we go any further I will say that i enjoyed the movie because it is, what i believe, to be the perfect example of \"Historical Fantasy\" and not Historical Fiction as it connects the fall of the Western Roman Empire with Arthurian fantasy. It's kind of popcorn fluffy and fun so i would recommend it if you have not already watched it. Plus there's a bunch of Game of Thrones actors in it. Jojen Reed plays a young Romulus Augustulus, Jeor Mormont plays a Goth warrior, Craster plays the commander of the Ninth Legion and Jorah Mormont plays Orestes to name a few.  \n\nTo sum up the movie, it begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus in 460. It's narrated by Ben Kingsley who plays Romulus' tutor, Ambrosinus (Merlin) who is also a part of a secret brotherhood that seeks to protect Julius Caesar's sword from evil. So basically Odoacer wants a third of Italy for himself, Orestes says no, Romulus is crowned Emperor in Rome and meets Colin Firth who plays a Roman general named Aurelius. The night after his coronation Odoacer and his Gothic army invade Rome and slaughter Orestes, his wife and Colin Firth's men. Odoacer, being the \"evil barbarian\" wants to kill Romulus but Ambrosinus convinces him to spare the boy and has him sent to a fortress built by Tiberius in Capri along with Ambrosinus. Odoacer then meets with representatives of the Eastern Roman Empire and asks to be named Roman Emperor over both the West and the East. \n\nThe Byzantines don't want to do that so they send an Indian warrior-woman with Colin Firth and a few of his surviving soldiers to bust Romulus Augustulus out of prison. They do that, find Julius Caesar's sword in a hidden chamber and escape. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Senate betray Romulus and intend to kill him so Colin Firth leads them to Britain. They go to Hadrian's Wall to find the Ninth Legion, Colin Firth bangs the Keralite warrior woman, they battle King Vortigyn and some of Odoacer's men and Romulus throws Caesar's sword and it gets stuck in a stone (see what they did there).         \n\nAt the end it turns out that Romulus changed his name to Uther Pendragon, supposedly because the Ninth Legion had a dragon on their banner and that Pendragon meant \"head of a dragon\". Ambrosinus changes his name to his old Briton name, Merlin, and the film ends showing Romulus' son Arthur. \n\n**Notes**\n\n* Romulus Augustulus was born around 460 as he was sixteen when he was deposed in 476. The movie portrays him around ten years old when in fact he was sixteen. \n* IMO the most glaring bit of badhistory is the fact that they felt the only safe place was Britain and that they would find no help in the West. When in fact Odoacer's rule never extended beyond Italy. Roman law and customs were still followed in Spain, Berbers in modern day Morocco acted as loyal vassals to the Empire and Syagrius continued to rule in what is now Soissons. Julius Nepos also ruled in Dalmatia. The latter two would have been a much better place for someone like Romulus to find safety, especially since both Syagrius and Odoacer petitioned the Emperor Zeno in Constantinople to be made Western Emperor. \n* The film has Romulus being crowned in a grand ceremony in Rome. The first note is that Rome had not been the capital of the West for years. The second is that coronations were not invented in the Roman Empire until later in its history. Romulus was declared Emperor by his father and reinforced by his father's troops.  \n* Another glaring bit of bad history is that Romulus is constantly called the \"last of Caesar's line\". In truth, Romulus' father Orestes was Germanic thus making Romulus part Germanic. Nero was the last Roman ruler descended from Caesar.\n* The movie depicts Imperial succession as hereditary but the Roman Empire was never totally hereditary. Emperors might appoint their sons as successors or at least chosen successors but there was never anything automatic. Emperors were proclaimed by the army, the senate or the people. By the fifth century \"Legitimacy\" mean recognition by the co-Emperor, which Romulus never had. The East still regarded Julius Nepos as Emperor. \n* Odoacer is portrayed as a savage barbarian who wants to kill Romulus when it is recorded that he recognized Romulus was just a pawn for his father and sent to live with some family members where he disappears from the record. \n* Odoacer is also depicted as wanting to be Emperor of both East and Western Roman Empires. While the real Odoacer might have harbored wet dreams of being Emperor, he was perfectly fine ruling Italy in Constantinople's name and issued coinage with Zeno, Leo II and Julius Nepos' likeness. The East granted him the title of Patrician but he ruled Italy as almost semi-autonomous as King of Italy until he deposed by Theodoric the Great when Odoacer proved disloyal.   \n* The Ninth Legion is depicted wielding gladius', short swords, lorica segmentatas and scarlet cloaks which the Roman army did not wear by that period. Most soldiers wore chain mail after the Segmentata was dropped in the third century.\n* The movie also portrays the Ninth Legion as having been around but married into the locals. Even if the Legion had been still around in some force by 460 its unlikely they would have been able to just don their old armor and fight against the Goths with a massive force of men. Especially since the Ninth disappears from Roman records in the mid second century. \n* A *third* bit of bad history is that the Eastern Roman Empire seems to wholly support Romulus Augustulus when he was regarded as a usurper (or perhaps the tool of a usurper) by the East.\n\nWooh. Well that was a lot of writing. Although it is not historically accurate (nor is it trying to be), the movie is very well connected with Arthurian myth. In both *The History of the Kings of Britain* and *Le Morte d'Arthur*, King Arthur defeats the forces of the Roman Empire. In the latter he claims ancestry from Constantine and crowns himself Roman Emperor. Aurelius is based off the semi-legendary British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus that supposedly won a great battle agains the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nHope you like it! \n\n\n",

To put it in the context of the metaphor of /r/BadHistory being a bunch of students and their professors chilling at a bar: we’re laughing at the idiots that come to class filled with misconceptions that they are too stubborn to change and those who take a lot of arguing to have their misconceptions corrected.

OP titled this post \"Son finds his lost mother in a Stone Age tribe.\"  While this is not the title of the news article, the article itself does use the phrase \"Stone Age.\"\n\nThe top comment is a reasoned explanation about why we shouldn't refer to these peoples as \"Stone Age.\"  One of [its replies with +40 points](http://np.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/26fw2b/son_finds_his_lost_mother_in_a_stone_age_tribe/chqwlcd?context=1) has so much bad history/anthropology:\n\n&gt;Some of us have romantic ideas about the simple folkways of preserved tribes, but in truth they are often extremely violent and misogynistic groups. As Yarima admits in the story, babies often die in the jungle; they have no medicine, no books. It's not romantic at all, and I'm not going to pretend like I have an anthropologist's faux unbiased perspective. I will say without apology that humanity is better off with medicine, diplomacy between groups (rather than constant tribal conflict), science, education, and technology. There are downsides to many of these advances (yes, *advances*; we are moving *forward*), but overall they bring stability, longevity, and enjoyment to people's lives.\n\n&gt;I'm not using \"the West\" as a standard; I'm using most of the world, which includes every skin color and continent, as a standard. I'm saying that knowingly eschewing medicine (\"babies die in the jungle\") and putting women at a lower status (you guys did read that part about gang rape being common for women who don't have a husband around, right? What about betrothing young girls to be married?) makes a society/culture worse. But I'm the idiot for wanting less malaria, less rape, less sexism, and less tribal strife because of my cultural bias. \n\nFor R5, the badhistory comes in the implication that history is teleological, with the most \"evolved\" being those who most resemble white countries (e.g. US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia).  And those that least resemble are both inferior and \"backwards.\"  You can see this in the claim \"yes, *advances*; we are moving *forward*.\"  As if technology represents some linear evolution of the entire society.\n\n\"I'm not using \"the West\" as a standard; I'm using most of the world, which includes every skin color and continent, as a standard.\"  This ignores how we perceive science and technology.  We have this sharp distinction of \"modern science\" and \"ancient/pre-modern science.\"  And the former is very much involved with European and colonial domination of others\n\n\"humanity is better off with...diplomacy between groups (rather than constant tribal conflict).\"  This seems like a huge over-generalization.  I was originally going to say here \"Not all ______ groups were engaged in constant tribal conflict,\" but I didn't know what to fill the blank with.  I would say nonwhite/non-Western, but the person explicitly says their not talking about just the West....So who is being talked about?  From the first paragraph, it would seem like this person is condemning the groups that don't have \"medicine, diplomacy, science, education, and technology.\"   So who are these groups that have none of these things?  The person says they aren't talking about just the West, but Western definitions of medicine, diplomacy, science, education, and technology are just that, Western.  I can't imagine a cultural group that doesn't have \"education,\" and where do we draw the line with \"having technology\"?",

I'd like to start off with a nice little bit of eugenics discussion.\n\nSomeone points out that Tesla did quite a few questionable things, such as supporting the idea of eugenics. \n\n&gt;It was 100 years ago and morality has advanced significantly since then. Tesla was human just like Edison. One of Tesla’s most disturbing ideas was his belief in using eugenics to purify the human race.[+4]\n\n\nOh no! An attack on the morality of Tesla! How shall we respond??\n\n&gt;Time has yet to prove him wrong. [+18]\n\nI don't even know what to say to that. [Like, did Nazi Germany not show the world how terrible eugenics was?](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007057) \nAnd what about the\n[ lebensborn?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn)\nI dunno man, it seems that time has proven eugenics to be bad. In fact, people almost [immediately found what the nazis did to be bad.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors%27_Trial) \nThen we get stuff about how edison was a thief!\n\n&gt;i hate how half the gd world just loves Edison... guy was a theif and a just dick head in general.... Tesla now there is a mad man with just a spark of something ...... god what i would give to just meet that guy.^[1]\n\nAnd...\n\n\n&gt;The man on the left is a genius. The man on the right is a charlatan and a thief.^[2]\n\nEdison was most definitely not a thief. He invented a lot of stuff I mean, you can't get [over 1000 patents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Edison_patents) by just stealing stuff. He made important developments in things like the phonograph and telegraph, and of course, the commercially viable lightbulb, which is one of the most important devices ever made. \n\nMoving on, \n\n&gt;Tesla invented alternating current.^[3]\n\n[WAIT! WHAT'S THIS!? YOU MEAN PEOPLE WITHOUT THE NAME TESLA WERE INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF AC GENERATORS!?](http://edisontechcenter.org/AC-PowerHistory.html)\n\nEven more stuff!!!!\n\n&gt;Edison thanks for the flashlight. Tesla thanks for the world.^[4]\n\nWhat does this even mean? Does this person seriously think that the lightbulb is an invention as negligible as the flashlight? The entire history of the modern world has been shaped by the fact that humans could easily light buildings and cities. It's unfair to act like Tesla is responsible for the current state of the world and then sell Edison so short. \n\nIf you want to cry a bit, you can read the filth comments on the  [imgur link](http://imgur.com/gallery/e0ZWILE) as well.\n\n\nHere's some gold from the Imgur comments, which I will just respond to snarkily instead of doing anything, because I think very little hasn't been said already:\n\n&gt;When I eventually teach my children about humility, I will most certainly use Edison as my negative example. His ego was so huge, that 1/2\n&gt;&gt;he forced arguably the greatest mind in recorded history to go unnoticed. If it weren't for Edison we'd have flying cars by now.\n\nTHE HOLE LEFT BY THE EDISON DARK AGES\n\n&gt;The way you put it, it kinda reminds me of Steve Jobs and Apple. Go ahead, downvote me. But true geeks know what I mean.\n\nONLY TRUE GEEKS CAN UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION\n\n&gt;I'm gonna be that pain in the ass parent that teaches my kid about Tesla, how to write cursive, and that Columbus is no hero\n\nI'm gonna read The Oatmeal to my child.\n\n&gt;Edison invented Electricity and light bulbs... just like Steve Jobs invented the Mobile Phone and tablet.\n\nEDISON DIDNT INVENT ANYTHING HE JUST MADE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS MEANWHILE TESLA INVENTED A/C.... OH WAIT THATS RIGHT HE DIDNT\n\n&gt;Edison found 10,000 ways that didn't work??

Sure the Byzantines wanted help against the Seljuk Turks, however Jerusalem was held by the Fatimids, and considered a secondary objective.  There is some cursory nod to earlier Muslim conquests, but these were almost 600 years after the fact, at least in the Levant.  I get the vibe that the author seems to think all Islamic empires in the middle ages were in cahoots.  \n\n\n&gt;Myth #2: Western Christians went on crusade because their greed led them to plunder Muslims in order to get rich.\n\nIn this section the author seems to only acknowledge the fact that mounting the first Crusade was expensive.  However he doesn't mention anything about the setting up of Crusader States and the various land titles that came with that.  People did fight out of religious zeal of course, but as I understand it, there was some promise of acquiring land.  I guess the Kingdom of Jerusalem wasn't a thing.\n\n\nThere is probably a lot more wrong with this, but I don't really feel I have the expertise to address it.  I guess what pinged my bullshit radar on this was the tone the author evokes.  Even the title \"You Thought the Crusades Were Evil... Until You Read This\" is disingenuous to any rational adult.  This whole thing is chocked full of loaded language and Presentism.  There is some mention of modern day Islamic extremists, but comparing them to medieval Muslims is just bad history.  \n  ",

        "text": "There seems to be a general interest in the contact period, with a lot of bad history floating about in the movies and the public consciousness. I wanted to review a movie that has been hailed for its historical accuracy and sympathetic depiction of Native Americans. Hopefully, by the end you will see *The Mission* is slightly historically accurate, and still falls victim to the common Hollywood tropes surrounding Native Americans on screen. The beginning of the film follows two main protagonists, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert de Niro), as they arrive, via different paths, at a Guarani mission of San Carlos above Iguazu Falls. One last note before we dive in. Though 1750 might seem old to students of American history, Spain had been in the Americas for more than two centuries. Slavers were raiding among the Guarani for more than a century and a half. The Guarani further upriver from the first missions (here symbolized as living above the falls) would surely have heard stories, been subject to, or even refugees from previous slaving raids by the time the events of the film take place. \n\nThis is no Eden, as Father Altamirano implies in the movie, this is a land of refugees trying in vain to survive beyond the reach of the slavers.\n\nNow to the movie!\n\n0:42 Opening text modification… “The historical events represented in this story are [sort of] true…”\n\n1:08 The irony of “The Indians are, once more, free to be enslaved by the Spanish and Portuguese settlers,” doesn’t really fall victim to subtlety. This part is kind of true, just misplaced in time. In 1752 Jesuit Father Luis Altamirano was sent (by the Society of Jesus, not the Pope as in the movie) to oversee the transfer of seven Guarani mission along the Rio Uruguay that had been inhabited by the Guarani since the 17th century.\n\n1:51 Guarani refers to a large linguistic group native to Paraguay, Argentina and Southern Brazil. Initial contact was established in 1537 by Gonzalo de Mendoza, with Jesuits arriving fifty years later. In 1608, after the Jesuits raised formal complaints about abuses against the Amerindians, including rampant slave raids, the Spanish crown gave the Jesuits authority to convert the Spanish territory of Guaryra (home of many Guarani). The Jesuits established the first Guayra mission of Loreto in 1610. The reductions/missions became a (sadly not very) safe haven against slave raiders operating out of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and 40,000 Guarani flocked to the missions requiring the establishment of twelve further reductions near Loreto. Fun aside: I lived for a brief time in a Guarani village in Eastern Bolivia. Their musical tradition is still going strong.\n\n2:08 The martyrdom of Father Gabriel’s predecessor. Note the necklace of teeth on a red-painted Indian. Nothing says “Fuck off, intruder!” like a necklace of teeth and red body paint. Sadly, I don’t know enough to comment on the accuracy of the body adornment as either Guarani, Waunana, or some costume designer’s invention.\n\n2:30 The Guarani are speaking! Three problems: those aren’t really Guarani, evidently we shouldn’t concern ourselves with what they are saying, and they just stay in that “Indian other” category.\n\nThe film was made, in part, in Colombia and members of the Waunana Tribe play the Guarani. Waunana is a Chocoan language that is very different from the Tupian Guarani language. The languages are mutually unintelligible and would be something akin to casting Norwegians to speak Norwegian while depicting events involving Italians in Rome. It’s okay. All Indians are the same right? \n\nWhich brings us to problem two, why the hell aren’t there subtitles? Shouldn’t we care to know what they are saying? This is a common theme in movies involving Native Americans. The Indians speak, but we don’t get the subtitles to understand what they are saying. Usually a white guy just interprets, or reacts, but the audience either can’t be bothered to read (sad in a way) or Indians don’t have deep thoughts worthy of imparting to the audience (even sadder). Though, rumor has it, the Waunana are cursing up a storm whenever they appear onscreen so maybe we don’t want to know exactly what they are saying anyway.\n\nFinally, problem three, in a movie about the Guarani missions we are presented with only two dimensional Guarani characters. We can’t know them, understand them, or sympathize with them in any more than the most stereotypical way because none of the Guarani are completely fleshed out as people. Sure we have Angry Teeth Necklace and Sympathetic Teeth Necklace (to be introduced shortly) and Cute Indian Kid but none of these are complete characters that allow us to dive into Guarani culture and opinions at the time. So, again, all Indians are the same, right?\n\n4:14 Just a priest tied to a cross going over a gigantic waterfall. Nothing to see here.\n\n6:14 Father Gabriel takes up his predecessor’s (smaller) cross. Surely there is a safer path up that waterfall, Father Gabriel!\n\n10:08 Is that a dead lizard tied to a cross or are you happy to see me? Which begs the question, if you have Guarani converts in the lower missions why not bring them along to smooth over first contact with their extended family in the jungle? Surely someone who can speak the language fluently would be a better introduction? Translators were vital to mission endeavors pushing further into the frontier, but Father Gabriel and his water-logged Pied Piper oboe will have to suffice.\n\n12:29 Gabriel, you’ve been working with the Guarani for years and presumably would at least know a few phrases. Speak to them! Angry Teeth Necklace is not amused. Again, we don’t know what he is saying even though Father Gabriel would likely be able to communicate, at least a little, with him.\n\n13:13 Cue Sympathetic Teeth Necklace in the role of “confused Indian looking at a Western invention”. I guess Gabriel’s general ineptitude means he is harmless. Presumably the war party comes to some agreement that Father Gabriel can come home with them. Sure would like to know what they said to each other since white guys usually mean slave raiders.\n\n15:00 The introduction of your friendly neighborhood slave raider, Mendoza, played by Robert de Niro. Kind of impressive that silly trap worked on people so accustomed to reading the jungle terrain. Mendoza’s presence at the forefront of a slaving raid at the edge of the frontier is a little odd. The vast majority of slave raids were conducted by Indians allied with the white slavers. A white slaver might accompany a raid every now and then, but Europeans usually packed too much, moved too slow, and made too much noise for their allies to worry with them. A European on the edge of the frontier meant he slowed his allies for hundreds of miles out, hampered their hunt, and would slow their return back home. Why bother bringing the white guy?\n\n16:08 The first glimpse of the showdown between slave raiders and the Jesuits. This will be a continued theme. In the early 1500s Indian slavery was outlawed throughout the Spanish Empire. Official law was ignored, especially along the frontier, where the Spanish continued to raid for slaves throughout the Americas. Proper decorum generally held that mission Indians were off limits to raids, but we’re talking about illegal slave raiders here, proper decorum isn’t one of their strong suits. \n\n17:04 Transporting the slaves back to the city for sale. I counted 16-20 captives from just one small raid. In a Guarani band of say 200 people that is 10% of the population gone in one raid. We like to blame epidemic disease, but slaving raids could fundamentally alter the demographics of small-scale Native American populations just as quickly. Speaking of epidemic disease, notice how none of the Indians are sick. The complete cocktail of disease, displacement, slavery, and warfare is responsible for Native American population decline after contact. Even though life kid of sucks for the Guarani, we are only seeing part of the story here.\n\n20:00 Notice Mendoza’s household staff is composed of Amerindian slaves/servants. Even though slaving was technically outlawed in Spain at the time black market slaves could be sold for household work as well as labor on plantations.\n\n26:50 Mendoza does a bad thing. Goodbye, young Aidan Quinn. Thanks for advancing a character arc.\n\n30:06 “You’re a mercenary. You’re a slave trader. And you killed your brother.” Followed by penance, Sisyphus style. Now he really is slowing his friends down.\n\n39:06 The Guarani recognize Mendoza and there is a brief stand-off where we wait to see what they will choose to do with the former slaver. The inclusion of a metal knife (when all the arrow points appear to be bone) is an interesting choice. It is 1750, after all. Metal tools would have been traded upriver for over a hundred years. They could still be rather scarce, but I’m a bit surprised we don’t see more metal incorporated more into the Guarani tool set or body adornment. Also, surely there would be some, albeit a few and perhaps old, firearms among the Guarani, right?\n\n42:00 A thriving mission where everyone works together to build the community. It all seems so happy. You almost forget everyone is huddled in the missions to try to find some measure of safety from slave raids.\n\n44:08 Again, I don’t know enough about Guarani and Waunana clothing to know if the women would be bare above the waist of if this is just another way to show wild Indians. I also don’t know if painting de Niro has any cultural significance or is just a way to show him bonding happily with the Guarani.\n\n53:30 More Guarani household servants/slaves. They are everywhere. Also, a sloth to remind you this is an exotic place.\n\n55:00 Time for a council. The Treaty of Madrid in 1750 did cede portions of Paraguay from Spain to Portugal, and the Guarani Missions were left in the middle of the fray.\n\n55:37 Don Cabeza is arguing an outdated premise that Native Americans were not capable of understanding Christian doctrine. After the 1573 Royal Orders for New Discoveries, Spain transitioned from expansion by military conquest to nominally spiritual conquest. Obviously, soldiers accompanied mission expansion, the royal order was broken with regularity, and personal opinion on the quality of the laws varied throughout the Americans. However, the whole transition hinged on the fact that Indians, though perhaps not completely capable of full adult reasoning, could receive salvation. Don Cabeza is arguing against nearly two hundred years of accepted Catholic doctrine while speaking to a church official. Not sure why he thinks that will work in his favor.\n\n1:15:24 Jesuits in canoes. In order to travel great distances to their far-flung missions Jesuits often became very well versed with canoes. Canadian Jesuits in Huron land were taught the proper etiquette of canoe travel including not picking up an oar unless they planned to row for a long time, how not to tip a canoe when getting in, and where to sit or stow goods inside the vessel. Not all missionaries took to the style of travel, though canoes provided the best way to navigate through the vast land masses.\n\n1:25:01 The battle at the end of the movie harkens both to the armed defense against slave raids in 1631 (where tens of thousands of Guarani fought unsuccessfully and were carried into slavery), and to the Guarani War of 1754-1756. Instead of fighting, and dying alongside the Guarani, the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions during the Guarani War. Many Guarani did not wish to abandon their homes and resisted the forced relocation. Events came to a head in 1756 when a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers attacked the missions, leaving 1,511 Guarani dead. The Jesuits were ultimately expelled from Spain, and Spanish colonies, in 1767.\n\n1:30:25 Note the use of (unnamed) Native American allies to augment the expulsion force. Though the popular perception of conquest is the white guys bravely charging into enemy territory, their inevitable success assured by superior weapons, invasions would not have been possible without Amerindian allies assisting every step of the way.\n\nFrom here on out, it gets sad and not very accurate. I’ll just watch.\n\nNaked, the orphans retreat deeper into the jungle while the following text appears on the screen: “The Indians of South America are still engaged in a struggle to defend their land and their culture. Many of the priests who, inspired by faith and love, continue to support the rights of the Indians for justice, do so with their lives.” Not sure if their nakedness is used to depict innocence, or is a trope of the wild Indians returning to their natural state in the jungle.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "According to the consensus in [this discussion](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/260ro3/what_is_something_you_thought_would_catch_on_but/chmn6ko), LA had the best public transit in the world before those bastards at GM killed it.  Unfortunately, the history doesn't back that up.\n\nThe first point that people overlook is that the Red Car (and most other mass transit systems in the early 20th century) wasn't \"public\" transit.  It was a private, for-profit entity--Pacific Electric.\n\nThat private company went bust for a host of economic, cultural and technological reasons.  The system was slammed by the Great Depression and never recovered profitability.  The economic structure of LA worked against the development of a dense urban core, a problem that the railroad itself exacerbated because many routes were chosen to connect suburbs developed by its owner.  The result was a dispersed network that had difficulty generating enough passengers even before the car provided an attractive alternative.  \n\nThe final bit of bad history is GM's role in all of this.  I'm fuzzier on this, but it looks to me like GM did probably conspire to acquire and dismantle electric streetcar companies...after most of them were already in financial trouble and the objective was to replace them with buses, which is still a form of mass transit.  It doesn't seem that anyone tries to argue that there was a grand conspiracy to destroy the streetcar to bolster private car sales until the 1970s.\n\nI've seen it argued that GM's role ensured the demise of mass transit in LA and that the alternative would have been public takeover of the system, similar to the NY subway or the London tube systems.  That strikes me as sheer presentism, since the idea only really gained traction after gas shortages and environmental concerns in the '70s began to sour people on private cars and boost nostalgia for the streetcars. \n\nIf you want the fun, easy listening source for this story, [the relevant episode of *99 Percent Invisible*](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-70-the-great-red-car-conspiracy/) is great, [as someone tried to point out](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/260ro3/what_is_something_you_thought_would_catch_on_but/chmtlyp).

I will lazily leave [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions) as proof that not every revolution is a sexy, William Wallace-y peasant uprising. \n\nThe next sentence is a bit confusing-- \"The American Revolutionary War - Started in the North, fought in the South, and won by the French.\" It is true that the first battles of the war began in the North-- Massachusetts. However the war was not primarily fought in the South.

In the words of one joint statement on the subject:\n\n&gt;[The] book *1421: The Year China Discovered the World*, is a work of sheer fiction presented as revisionist history. Not a single document or artifact has been found to support his new claims on the supposed Ming naval expeditions beyond Africa...Menzies' numerous claims and the hundreds of pieces of \"evidence\" he has assembled have been thoroughly and entirely discredited by historians, maritime experts and oceanographers from China, the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.\n\n[Next](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/266z8e/i_graduated_high_school_in_2001_scientifically/chobbiu) we have the claim that the conclusion that Native Americans crossing the Bering Strait has since been proven wrong.

This user is explaining why China was in such a weak state come around the end of the Qing Dynasty. Besides the strange attributation of a total rejection of industrialized technology to \"Confucianism\", the bolded part is where the best badhistory comes out.\n\nNamely, he tries to portray the Qing as progressively declining, but the timeline in which he portrays it is completely, and totally off. I did a double-take when he mentioned Emperor Kangxi as a poor governer, and his successors worse, because that's so bad I want to slap him in his face with Qing-era vase. Why?\n\n[Kangxi is basically the Lincoln of China](http://www.learn.columbia.edu/nanxuntu/html/emperors/) \n\nHe is WIDELY celebrated as one of China's greatest emperors-- and this is rubbing shoulders with over 2,000 years worth of the likes of [Qin Shi Huang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang) or [Wu Zetian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian). He effectively led his own troops in suppressing multiple revolts, he forced submission of the Tungning Kingdom in Taiwan, halted the advance of Russia, expanded China's territory northeast, and ushered in an era of peace, wealth and prosperity for generations after his lifetime. He even had a great appreciation for embracing Western technology and culture, an attitude that unfortunately was not shared by his immediate successor, Emperor Yongzheng, who still was regarded as a capable, if despotic ruler. \n\nThe beginning of Emperor Kangxi's ridiculously long 61-year long reign is also widely seen as the beginning of Qing's height of power-- never since the Ming dynasty was the Imperial Palace as stable or influential-- and his successors, his son Emperor Yongzheng and his grandson Emperor Qianlong are also seen as very capable emperor's in their own right, Qianlong especially so--! He is also regarded as *another* one of China's greatest emperors, which is extremely strange that this guy would call him \"weak\" as successor to Kangxi, since it was Qinglong who essentially established China's modern borders that we see today. \n\nIt was only in Emperor Qianlong's later years of reigning (who also ruled for an obscenely long time for a Chinese Emperor, he abdicated during his 61st year) that the Qing started to decline and China's downfall would begin, which is almost completely opposite of what this guy was trying to imply in regards to Kangxi-- that somehow the Qing were on a slope down during when they were actually at their zenith.\n\nSo like, between over *120* years of height of awesomeness for the Qing Dynasty between Kangxi and Qianlong, and this guy wants to call them as \"progressively worse and worse\"?!\n\n\n**Tl;DR a guy tries to provide an in-depth explanation to China's downfall, ends up dismissing China's Marcus Aurelius as a poor governer.**",

        "text": "The video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvDFsxjaPaE\n\nThe complaint:\n\nIs it really possible to explain world war 2 in 7 minutes? Not without resorting to explanations which generalize the content to the point of triviality!\n\nThe R5:\n\nFrom the beginning it relies hugely on tropes about World War Two that have little grounding in reality. I'm going to leave aside the lack of nuance concerning prewar European politics as a possibly necessary simplification. However, the gross simplification continues beyond that.\n\nFor one, the idea of 'blitzkrieg' was not the entirely novel idea that is is portrayed as. German operations in Poland and France were characterized by combined arms operations which had infantry and tanks working in close concert with each other, not separately as the video depicts. In fact, it is when German tanks got separated from their infantry that they ran into trouble.\n\nSuch was the case at Kursk much later in the war when Guderian complained that due to lack of infantry support his tanks were forced to go \"quail shooting\" at enemy infantry with their big guns. Ultimately, what 'blitzkrieg' has come to describe is nothing more than the concentration of forces at a decisive point of battle. I can't even begin to date how old this concept of warfare is.\n\nThis isn't to say that the Germans did not do new things in terms of strategy or tactics. Due to their lower number of tanks, they quickly recognized the necessity of concentrating them in order to achieve local superiority and breakthroughs. This is in contrast to the French strategy of distributing tanks directly to infantry divisions throughout the line. However, in illustrating this point the video makes another error. French tanks were actually qualitatively superior to German ones. They were better armored and armed. Nonetheless, the video depicts doddering relics of the first world war which complain they \"weren't made to go this fast.\"\n\nFrom there, to even mention Operation Sea Lion and the invasion of the British Isles as a remote possibility is a rather superfluous diversion from far more important events affecting the conduct of war. The Italio-German invasion of the Balkans and Greece comes to mind. To jump directly to Barbossa skips over quite a bit of fighting in other theaters, but that's fine.\n\nIt lets us get to the \"winter beat the Germans\" trope.\n\nThere's no doubt that the onset of winter seriously affected German combat effectiveness, but to credit it solely with halting the drive on Moscow is ridiculous. I think people would be more likely to point to the concurrent Soviet counter attacks around Rostov-On-Don as more important. Afterall, they did draw quite a bit of resources away from Army Group Center at a crucial time.\n\nToo bad the Russians didn't have enough guns or they would have done better! Oh wait, that's another myth. Yes, there were certainly some incidents where unprepared and unarmed conscripts were thrown into battle. It certainly was not the norm though, and I know of no instance which would give credence to the whole idea of picking up dead mens rifles. For gods sake, 37 million mosin-nagants were produced during the Second World War.\n\nThey also received quite a lot of aid from the Americans (as is mentioned) to help keep the Red Army supplied. Unfortunately, this mention of aid to the allies is conflated with Americas moratorium on oil exports to Japan; implying the two things arose concurrently. This is not the case, as the American embargoes of certain products to Japan were a direct response to Japanese aggression in China and had nothing to do with the European war.\n\nThe mistaken representation of the Pacific War is compounded when the scene depicting Pearl Harbor includes a kamikaze attack, the first of which did not begin occurring until October 1944: a whole three years later. Good thing we don't really talk about the Pacific Theater too much after that.\n\nToo busy glossing over the entirety of 3 years of war in Europe so we can talk about D-Day.\n\nStalingrad and Operation Uranus probably aren't even important enough to mention. Nor is Operation Bagration. Afterall, those two operations only managed to destroy TWO ENTIRE ARMY GROUPS.\n\nAnd, that's about all I have the interest in reviewing.\n",

        "text": "[Article](http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201405201448-0023749)\n\nThe American Freedom Defense Initiative is one of the many anti-Islamic groups listed by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://www.splcenter.org/node/3502/activegroups).  It was founded by Pamela Geller, a blogger who also happened to create two more anti-Islamic groups out of eight operating in New York.  \n\nIn her attempt to fight what she views as Islamic influences creeping into the United States, her organization launched a bus campaign in Washington D.C. that makes a few bad claims that I would like to take a look at.\n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/WClZuuT) is an image of the actual ad.\n\nClaim 1:\n&gt; Islamic Jew Hatred: It's in the Quran\n\nAn issue such as antisemitism in the Quran can not be viewed as simply as this. It has been up to debate and different historians and theologists have their own interpretations. Marvin Perry believes that the references to Judaism in the Quran as negative, while critics of this view believe that the negative references were only to specific groups of Jews (such as the Jewish Arabian tribes of Banu Nadir, Banu Qaynuqa, and Banu Qurayza)  In the [Constitution of Medina](http://www.constitution.org/cons/medina/con_medina.htm), an agreement between the tribes of Medina and put forth by Mohammed, there are many instances of religious tolerance.\n\n(15) God’s protection is one, the least of them may give protection to a stranger on their behalf. Believers are friends one to the other to the exclusion of outsiders. \n\n(16) To the Jew who follows us belong help and equality. He shall not be wronged nor shall his enemies be aided. \n\n(25) The Jews of the B. ‘Auf are one community with the believers (the Jews have their religion and the Muslims have theirs), their freedmen and their persons except those who behave unjustly and sinfully, for they hurt but themselves and their families. \n\n(37) The Jews must bear their expenses and the Muslims their expenses. Each must help the other against anyone who attacks the people of this document. They must seek mutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a protection against treachery. A man is not liable for his ally’s misdeeds. The wronged must be helped.\n\nI include the example of the Constitution of Medina as an example of the support and respect that Mohammed, Islam, and the Quran placed on Judaism.  As a monotheistic, Abrahamic religion, Jews were regarded as people of the book just like Christians and Muslims. I interpret any negative portrayal of Jews in the Quran as a negative portrayal of a group of Jews, not a negative portrayal of a group **because** they are Jewish.\n\n\nClaim 2: \n&gt; Adolf Hitler and his staunch ally, the leader of the Muslim world, Haj Amin al-Husseini.\n\nLeader of the Muslim world.  How about no.  Al-Jusseini was the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, which put him in charge of Islamic sites in Jerusalem as the highest authority of Islamic law.  Giving him the title of \"Leader of the Muslim World\" goes along with the Western idea of a Pope of Islam (addressed in David Fromkin's \"A Peace to End All Peace\" in regards to the Lord Kitchener's attempt to control Islam, Fromkin pg 96).  This ignores the fact that there are multiple sects of Islam, as well as the fact that there hasn't been a one supreme leader of islam for many centuries.  \n\nNext the ad uses the *Reductio ad Hitlerum* fallacy, by associating the Mufti with Hitler.  The idea is that if the Mufti associated with Hitler as an ally he must have been an anti-semite!  Maybe.  Maybe he did hate Jews.  Maybe he allied with Hitler in order to create a state for Palestinians free.  Maybe it's maybelline.  This is a point that I believe is up to debate.  \n\nBonus Bad History!  The [SPLC reported](http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2011/05/05/muslim-basher-pamela-geller-pushes-another-obama-fairy-tale-proudly/) that on her blog Pamela Geller claimed that Malcolm X had sexual relations with a woman named Ann Dunham.  Ann later gave birth to a baby boy.  That boy's name?  Barrack **HUSSEIN** Obama. ",

        "text": "Somewhat minor one here (no pun intended), but it's one of my pet peeves. [The thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/260tvj/til_lewis_carroll_the_author_of_alice_in/) links to Wikipedia's article on Carroll. \n\nLewis Carroll was, of course, the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a 19th century English writer and clergyman. most famous for his children's books and photography, much of which featured depictions of nude children. Carroll became very close to the family of Henry Liddell, the dean of the Oxford college where Carroll was studying. The Liddells' youngest daughter Alice was the subject of many of his photographs and possibly served as an inspiration for the \"Alice\" character in several of his books. The exact nature of the relationship between Carroll and the Liddells has been the subject of much speculation.\n\nThe \"Lewis Carroll was a pedophile!\" thing is pretty much taken as fact by a lot of people. The popular sense of the man is that he was weirdly fascinated and obsessed with young girls, to the exclusions of more proper and healthy relationships with adults. At my Catholic elementary school the teachers apparently thought this, as they wouldn't let us watch *Alice in Wonderland* or read any of Carroll's books, although they really didn't tell us *why*, of course. I've heard it in many other places as well, including a mention of Carroll's \"obsession\" with young girls in my high school English Lit tetbook. \n\nThere *was* some sort of rift that developed between Carroll and the Liddell family. Many people, including several biographers of Carroll, have speculated that the rift resulted from Carroll's unhealthy interest in Alice. These claimed that he had no interest in adult women, preferring the company of children, possibly because of prurient desires. \n\nHowever, as [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Carroll#Suggestions_of_paedophilia) notes,\n\n&gt;Cohen and other biographers argue that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained \"break\" with the family in June 1863. However, there has never been significant evidence to support the idea, and the 1996 discovery of the \"cut pages in diary document\" (see below) seems to make it highly probable that the 1863 \"break\" had nothing to do with Alice, but was perhaps connected with rumours involving her older sister Lorina (born 11 May 1849, so she would have been 14 at the time), her governess, or her mother (who was also nicknamed \"Ina\").\n\nFurther, modern scholars have begun to look at Carroll in a different light. They believe that the prevailing image of the man as a socially inept weirdo creepily attracted to children but unable to pursue adult relationships is largely a myth, perpetuated by biographers who took the rumors of impropriety as fact, and by later readers and students projecting modern sensibilities onto 19th century norms (Presentism, ho!). \n\nSpecifically, scholars have noted that, far from being some sort of scandalous aberration, nude photographs of children were commonplace in Victorian England, and it is only the 20th century perception that nudity always == sexual that has retconned this into something dirty. The notion of Carroll having been attracted only to children is also false, as his own letters and diaries show that he not only had a keen romantic interest in women, but he carried on several (*actually* scandalous) affairs during his life. [Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Carroll#.22Carroll_Myth.22)\n\nAs one commenter in the TIL thread noted, OP didn't even bother to read the whole section he was linking to. He just absorbed the \"dude was a creeper!\" accusation and went to town. [sigh] Drives me nuts, that kind of thing. ",

        "text": "Some background to begin with. My aunt has a degree in History but hardly done anything with it. Naturally she's interested in the topic and the knowledge is very useful but she's not a researcher or academic is what I mean. Her area of interest has been statehood, eugenics, nationalism that kind of thing. I digress. She works for a government institution that shall remain unnamed as a senior assistant basically. This institution catalogs artifacts from all over the world and when these are received they need to log exactly where they were sent from. For that they have a massive Excel file with country codes and this is what the staff uses.\n\nRight. Onto the bad history. My aunt has begun noticing many emails with people unsure of what to document things as, i.e. 'We have something that is technically from Siam and that isn't in the Excel file, what do I log it as?' - that kinda thing. So auntie brought it up in a meeting and said, hey this list is out of date how about we update it so it's relevant? She brought up a variety of countries that were not on the list (Islands on the South Pacific for example).\n\nThe guy responsible the list did not like this. He said if they were going to change the list, they had to bare in mind the national sensibilities and that only sovereign nations were listed for that reason. Yes he went there. So my aunt asked what he meant by that since countries like Jamaica were classified as 'West Indies' (I'm not even joking) but somehow the Chanel Islands and the Falklands were classed as independent territories when they were in fact British Territories.\n\nAt this stage the guy became rather rude and said something along the lines of 'Who cares? When do we ever get things from places like Fiji anyway?!' to which my aunt replied that she doesn't remember ever seeing an artifact from Antartica but somehow that was still on the list. He once again went back to 'these little islands are not sovereign territories, you are being offensive'. At this point my aunt lost it and asked him if he knew how much he could be offending people by classifying now-independent countries under colonial names (i.e.Zaire and 'the Congo' rather than D.R.C or R.C). Once again he said that those are not sovereign nations. So she asked him what exactly he defined as a sovereign nation and how exactly he intended to classify this. Did he subscribe to a particular school of thought under international law? Did he believe a nation was sovereign through declarative theory or constitutive theory? What about the De Facto nations? Well you can imagine how taken back everyone was to hear the secretary who normally takes the minutes and does admin bring this up. And she was pissed, she comes from an ex-colony and knows about the topic in a personal and academic level.\n\nAt this stage the boss intervened and asked the guy to prepare a definition of what a 'sovereign state' is in his eyes and to propose a list. After the meeting he approached my aunt and asked why on earth she was so pissed and she explained it to him. She also pointed out that even though this was an internal list if it was ever leaked out that a government body was putting countries under former colonial names sensibilities then would truly hit. She suggested to simply use an official government or UN list of recognised countries and have a special categories for the 'unrecognised' and tricky ones. He asked her if she could instead draft a proposal on what they should class as a sovereign nation or not. She said maybe, but that was way above her pay grade and would involve a lot of research and academic writing. This week they are meeting again and Bob and his list are going to present a definition.\n\nWhy this is bad history? Well because the concept of sovereignty is a huge can of worms that many historians have tried to fish with throughout history. Socrates, Hobbes, Bodin, Locke, Rousseau, Oppeinheim, Max Weber, Andrew Heywood these are just a couple of names of writers who dealt with this concept from mostly an *internal* perspective. This even touching the discussion of the role *external* recognition plays apart on the definition of a nation. I mean are we parting from tradition here? Recognition by the UN? Recognition by other countries? Self-decree and *de facto* recognition as what the Principality of Sealand claims? There are two main trains of thought when it comes to external recognition of a country.\n\nNumero Uno would be Constitutive Theory, or you can declare yourself a nation but until other countries recognise you, you don't count. It grew in the 19th century and was heavily cemented in Europe particularly with the Final Act in the early 1800s (Wiki's saying 1815). But then of course the international community doesn't always agree in recognising a country either. Wiki actually has a good quote on this:\n\n&gt;\"International Law does not say that a State is not in existence as long as it isn't recognised, but it takes no notice of it before its recognition. Through recognition only and exclusively a State becomes an International Person and a subject of International Law\" **(Lassa Oppenheim, Ronald Roxburgh (2005). International Law: A Treatise)**\n\nNumero Dos is Declarative Theory sets basic criterias for a state to be classed as a person under International Law (I think I got all of them): \n\n&gt;1. Capacity to interact with other States, 2. Permanent population, 3. Defined territory, 4. A government.\n\nSo statehood becomes separate from recognition from other nations. This theory became popular with the Montevideo Convention which was signed on the League of Nations later on.\n\nThere is of course a third theory that falls somewhere in-between (State Practice) and inumerous splits and different interpretations and trains of thoughts not only through Historical research but also in Law, Philosophy, etc.\n\n**In short** This guy was propagating terrible history because of his approach to the topic. He believed that something that has been debated for literally centuries had a simple, definitive answer that he could declare with no research or academic background. Worse he argued over the sensitivity of the issue while taking no consideration for his own bias or thinking of how the population from small, former colonies might feel being addressed by the name their countries were given by their colonisers or before independence. He opened a gigantic can of worms with no understanding what he was doing.\n\nAnd I found all of it goddamned hilarious, cannot wait to hear what he comes back with later this week. \n\nI'm sorry if this is long and some of it not informative enough/incorrect. I'd be happy to change or add, as I said I'm aware it is a huge topic and my understanding of it as a Graphic Design undergraduate with History as a side-interested is, shall we say, limited.",

Anyways, I love history, I'm always more than a little suspicious whenever I hear people say something to the effect of \"people were too stupid to realize X way back when\", because more often I find there's a wide variety of factors limiting what people in different contexts could have known or done, and usually whoever is saying this has no idea what they're talking about and are just wrong. \n\n[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/25w1jl/att_buys_directv_for_nearly_50_billion/chldylv?content=1) post in /r/technology is exactly what I'm talking about (in that they're just wrong). I'm more into ancient history, but I know enough about the 19th century to know this is pretty much completely false. Merchants and moneymen have always been aware of the benefit of getting on the good side of the powers that be, and in this period there were plenty of businessmen getting into politics. Just because Cleveland and Roosevelt were \"trust-busters\" doesn't mean there wasn't businessmen and bankers getting their hands in politics outside of the SCOTUS.\n\nSomeone better read in 19th century America can probably go into further detail here; I just got annoyed at the modern bias of \"everyone used to be so dumb back in the day, but I'm not because reasons\".\n\n**Edit**: I'm a maroon and botched r5, by bad. The quote I was referring to in particular reads as follows \n\n&gt; The difference between now and then is that you have several politicians in on the scheme. Back then, they were too stupid to realize that they should deal the senators and congressmen in. They have certainly learned their lesson.\n\nNeedless to say, the idea of a merchant greasing the elbows of the powers that be is most decidedly *not* a 21st century American invention.",

        "text": "Out of nowhere in the comments on a blog post about NZ politics and the desirability of mid-20th century style social democracy:\n\n&gt; Imperial Russia was a completely backward radically reactionary state. If you want to know how “industrialised” the place was, in 1914 just 10% of the population was literate. Because the tiny Russian elite refused to be taxed in a modern sense, the state relied on feudal taxation – poll taxes, excise duties – and was chronically short of money. Imperial Russia fell out of the ranks of the Great powers after it’s defeat in the Crimean war (where the medieaval attitude of the aristocracy to the serfs is best summed up by the issuing of a post-war contract to a British firm to tidy up the battlefields by removing the skeletons and grinding them down to bone meal), and despite an economic “boom” in the 1890s – from a very low base – remained a fundamentally backward country defeated by Japan in 1905. When the Great War started, the Tsarist regime barely lasted two years, with the Russian army collapsing in the Summer of 1916 after suffering around 2 million dead in less than 24 months fighting – a figure indicative of a regime whose attitudes had not changed from that of the Crimea.\n\nOriginal post [here] (http://dimpost.wordpress.com/2014/05/18/this-actually-happened/), comment #43.\n\nR5: While Russia was certainly behind the industrial forerunners (The UK, USA, Germany and to a lesser extent, France), it was still a relatively well industrialised country in 1917.  His 10% literacy figure appears to be wrong - a study of Soviet language policy* put it at 29% in 1897, and presumably it was a little higher in 1917.  That's not a great figure, but it puts Russia at a midpoint between highly literate societies (Germany, Sweden) and largely illiterate societies (China, India, Africa).\n\nAlso, his contention that Russia was no longer considered a Great Power after 1870 is laughable.  Great Power status is fuzzy, but in 19th century Europe there was something close to formal qualifications for the status, and Russia met them even after its defeat in Crimea.   Russia continued to be seen as an equal in the diplomatic arena by Germany, France, the UK et al.\n\ntl:dr - Blog commenter claims Czarist Russia was a howling feudalist nightmare, is wrong.\n\n*Lenore Grenoble, 'Language Policy in the Soviet Union'",

Lee was a great man who campaigned tirelessly against slavery\n\nRobert E. Lee was a man who, as the husband of Mary Custis, effectively inherited all the slaves at the Arlington Plantation from his father-in-law, George Washington Parker Custis. Custis, who passed in 1857, stated in his living will that the slaves at Arlington were to be granted manumission upon his death, or within five years of it in the event of financial necessity. Lee, of course, ignored that first part of the will and chose the latter option, waiting until late Dec. 1862 (over the five-year mark and just days before the Emancipation Proclamation would take effect) to give them their freedom, essentially because keeping them on as slaves was more profitable...as one might expect anybody justify it. Of course, this is only further challenged by the fact that Lee actually fought a legal battle to have that section of the will nullified, allowing him to extend their servitude beyond that limit—all this while he was off fighting a war to preserve slavery, even if that wasn't his specific reason for fighting. Lee had a vested interest in the institution of slavery, and actively supported it.\n\nOne of the reasons he gets this reputation among Lost Causers and in popular image (as a result of Lost-Cause distortions of history) is found in the [1856 letter to his wife](http://fair-use.org/robert-e-lee/letter-to-his-wife-on-slavery) for the following excerpt:\n\n&gt;In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral &amp; political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.\n\nThat sounds like a declaration of his opposition to slavery on the face of it, but (if we ignore everything he did and only take into account his words), he directly follows this by saying the following:\n\n&gt;I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, &amp; while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially &amp; physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, &amp; I hope will prepare &amp; lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known &amp; ordered by a wise Merciful Providence. Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild &amp; melting influence of Christianity, than the storms &amp; tempests of fiery Controversy....**While we see the Course of the final abolition of human Slavery is onward, &amp; we give it the aid of our prayers &amp; all justifiable means in our power, we must leave the progress as well as the result in his hands who sees the end; who Chooses to work by slow influences; &amp; with whom two thousand years are but as a Single day. Although the Abolitionist must know this, &amp; must See that he has neither the right or power of operating except by moral means &amp; suasion, &amp; if he means well to the slave, he must not Create angry feelings in the Master;** that although he may not approve the mode which it pleases Providence to accomplish its purposes, the result will nevertheless be the same; that the reasons he gives for interference in what he has no Concern, holds good for every kind of interference with our neighbors when we disapprove their Conduct; Still I fear he will persevere in his evil Course.\n\nSo we can see that Lee's views are decidedly more complex *in his own wording*, in addition to his actions—[which were not exactly those of a 'benevolent' man.](http://fair-use.org/wesley-norris/testimony-of-wesley-norris) But one thing is clear: he so much as states, without ambiguity, his opposition to *abolitionism,* which was specifically a \"campaign against slavery.\" This is not the same as being anti-slavery, even in the vaguest sense like Lee's.\n\nThe \"tried to get it abolished several times before the war\" bit, I assume, is just made up.\n\n---\n\n&gt;He only fought for the south because he supported the right of secession.\n\nEven this is mostly wrong. It's well known that Lee had very strong reservations against Virginia's secession. Here's just one of the more commonly quoted things he had to say about it (I believe in a Jan. 1861 letter to his son):\n\n&gt;As an American citizen, I take great pride in my country, her prosperity and her institutions, and would defend any State if her rights were invaded. But I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than the dissolution of the Union. It would be an accumulation of all the evils we complain of, and I am willing to sacrifice everything but honor for its preservation. I hope, therefore, that all constitutional means will be exhausted before there is a resort to force. Secession is nothing but revolution.\n\nThe other well known detail, of course, is that Lee was extremely loyal to Virginia, and declared that he would not take up arms against the people of his state. (He inevitably did that, as Virginia was rather divided on secession, and many Virginians 'defected' or remained loyal to the Union from the onset.)",

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suro_of_Geumgwan_Gaya):\n\n&gt;According to the founding legend of Geumgwan Gaya recorded in the 13th century texts of the chronicle Garakguk-gi (hangul: 가락국기, hanja: 駕洛國記) of Samguk Yusa, King Suro was one of six princes born from eggs that descended from the sky in a golden bowl wrapped in red cloth. Suro was the firstborn among them and led the others in setting up 6 states while asserting the leadership of the Gaya confederacy. [1][2]\n\nR5: This here shows us that the author of this blog is confusing folklore with history. Tales of Kings, born from eggs are interesting to both read and to study Anthropological but are not useful for deterring historical fact. For example Historians support the existence of a man named jesus of Galilee but do not support that he turned water into wine. Here we can  accept that their may be contact of some sort with the Indian subcontinent with early Korea but the existence of Heo hang Ock and Kim Suro we cannot confirm their existence given that their existence is only traced from a book of folklore and cannot justify the racial views of the author.\n\nTLDR: Indians from them are great, others races suck.

The opposite is true. In comparison to Jamestown or the Sugar Isles, Massachusetts Bay was the most livable of any colony. Life expectancies rose, food was more plentiful than in other parts of British America, and there was generally less risk of death by disease or violence. It's even been proposed that New Englanders \"invented grandparents\", as in other parts of Britain people tended to die before being able to have much input in the lives of their children's children. While I don't know how reliable that claim is, the fact of the matter is that Puritan New England was not exactly a rough place to live, especially in comparison to the rest of British America.\n\nThe article itself suggests that \"many\" kidnapped infants opted to stay with their adopted tribes, and not be returned to the villages where they were born. While some comments point out the faulty assumptions raised by that article (there were few instances of this happening, and this has little to do with the quality of life in New England), very many do not.\n\nThe comments contain some wonderful quips such as:\n&gt;The puritan philosophy is the fear that someone, somewhere, might be having a good time and you can't stop it\n\nOr\n\n&gt; And yet no one thought \"hmm maybe there's something to living life like this\"...\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;Puritan New England is the driest of all history material, so it makes sense that life sucked that much.\n\nOr educated remarks like:\n\n&gt;Yeah. I've heard of this... I believe it was called Rhode Island. I'm serious.\nEdit: downvotes? Ignorant people who don't know the history of Rhode Island should do themselves a favor...

        "text": "First actual submission here so I am kind of nervous &gt;.&gt; \n\nAnyways, was perusing /r/Askreddit and came across this little gem:\n\n*The only thought scarier than yours is wondering if there really never WAS an organic terrorist threat genuinely orchestrated by 3rd century goat-herders who hate apple pie and iPods.* \n\nLink for those interested: www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/25q1iq/what_is_something_you_believe_to_be_true_but_have/chjrrai\n\nR5:  There are a host of problems here really. First, the 9/11 attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda, a predominantly Arab group whose founders were from Saudi Arabia (Bin Laden), and Egypt (al-Zawahiri). Both men attended college, with al-Zawahiri working for several years as a medical doctor and according to wikipedia there are conflicting accounts about whether or not Bin Laden ever graduated. Either way, according to the New York Times terrorist operatives attacking Western targets actually tend to be if anything  slightly more educated than the American public: http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/akhwaja/media/madrassa/NYTimes.htm\n\nAnyways, it seems to me that they are calling Afghanistan 3rd century, and there are just as many problems with this. 1- Islam arose in the mid 7th century A.D. The form of militant theocratic Islam practiced by the Taliban has its earliest roots in Saudi Wahabiism that began in the 18th century, however modern political Islam like the Taliban really traces its 20th century rise to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and the perceived humiliation and discrediting of secular, pan-Arab modernest trends in the Middle East. Much like western religions, fundamentalist movements are a distinctly modern way of coping/rejecting perceived cultural globalization and secularization. Afghan society is also not some stagnant monolith that hasn't changed in thousands of years. Agrarian societies aren't trapped in time for centuries while urban ones skip forward, Afghanistan today looks far different than it did 20 years ago, or 50 years ago, or even 100 years ago. The comment that they are \"3rd century goat herders\" also seems to presuppose a linear progression of history in which it is impossible for \"goat herders\" to be modern, even though get this; There are still goat herders in many other \"modern\" countries including in Western Europe!\n\nReally, the comment just hits on a lot of bad historical assumptions while also hinting at some colonial and racial baggage in which \"we Westerners are modern and superior living in the 21st century while those dirty brown people are stuck in the past and need to learn to act exactly like use.\" That might not be yourtheir point, but the comment utilizes tropes that currently and historically have been used to buttress this view.\n\nAl-Qaeda also doesn't really as an institution hate apple pies and ipods. Their anti-Westernism is a result of complex political and social forces within their own societies. More aptly they hate the secularism and materialism that they associate with the West, while also utilizing tools and technology pioneered and produced by the West. They hate Western ideology really, not so much Western technology. ",

        "text": "[So we have this monstrosity](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/25q684/feminism_and_the_disposable_male/)\n\nFirst, allow me to say that the video is 16 minutes. I can near guarantee that most of the 1500 upvotes come from people who did not watch the whole video, given my knowledge of the defaults. The title alone is free karma. But let's move on.\n\nThe video is rife with absolutely ridiculous generalizations. Let's just go through.\n\n[0:52]\n&gt;Male disposability has been around since the dawn of time... And it's based on the principle that  [women] come first, men come last. that's the way it has always been. Seats in lifeboats, getting rescued from burning buildings, who gets to eat.\n\nI feel that this is a completely Titanic-inspired view on gender relations in society. To argue that for all of human history, the idea of \"women and children first\" has been the standard is an unprovable and extremely bold claim. By leading with the lifeboat example, she's basically saying \"you know those Victorian era ideals? Well they're basically the norm for human history.\" \n\n[1:11]\n&gt;\"Society places men dead last every time.\"\n\nThis may well be the most ridiculous opinion to hold about history. To claim that men, who have comprised the ruling classes of almost every   empire, who have historically had much more power than women in things like owning land, voting, marraige,  and almost everything, are in \"dead last\" is one of the most ignorant points you can make. Counterpoints: In the US, women were constitutionally given suffrage after males and black people. So far ahead of men. \n[2:26]\n&gt;\"Back when we were still living in caves, [women and children first mentality] was necessary for survival. People lived in small spread out settlements. If lots of women died in a disaster, that would spell the end of the settlement. The level of importance that a settlement placed on the wellbeing of women and children reflected, almost always, how successful that settlement was, and that can be expanded to entire societies.\n\nThis quote has it all. First, it's pretty amazing how one sentence she's talking about living in caves and then we're suddenly in settlements. Also, what the hell does she mean that everyone lived in small and scattered settlements? Huh? [Man, sumerians sure were far apart and separated.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Cities_of_Sumer_%28en%29.svg)\nHer next claims about how success in a settlement was based on how much emphasais they placed on protecting the women from some \"big disaster\" is complete speculation. What disaster would wipe out 60% of the women in the town that would not ruin the settlement anyways? Like, the success of a place is not purely based on reproduction. And then saying that these statements she just completely pulled out of her ass describe the functioning of modern society is completely ridiculous. \n\n[3:47]\n&gt;\"The level of importance humans place on the safety of women and children is one of the reasons we have become so successful and come to dominate on this planet.\"\n\nWHAAAAAAAAAAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!? The reason that humans are such a highly evolved species is that we PROTECT WOMEN AND CHILDREN!?!?!?! Jesus fucking christ. What about Lions? They travel in prides where the males protect the females. Why aren't lions in space? Of all the reasons you could give for why humans are such a unique species, you give that we protect women and children, something most mammals do? And I mean, I think medical advances and scientific advances are much more important to our sudden population booms than our protecting of women. [Why did the world population suddenly skyrocket in the last half century? Was that when we started protecting women? ](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/World-Population-1800-2100.svg)\n\n[4:37]\n&gt;\"The most successful societies had a really good balance between allowing women freedom and protecting them.\"\n\nNow we start getting really weird. What the fuck does that even mean? \"The best societies give women freedom, but not too much, because they must be protected.\"  Where are we, 1910s America? Is she arguing that at a certain point historically, human rights become detrimental to society?\n\nI could continue, but I'm going to have an aneurysm if I continue. My favorite thing about this is how all the commenters love how she talks so calmly and non-crazily about this subject, even though she's completely batshit insane. There is at most one or two facts in this entire video, and the rest reads like she learned her entire history of gender relations from the second half of the movie Titanic. \n\nI'm done. ",

The Americans would have probably had a Japanese holocaust of their own.\n\nUm, the Americans have a lot of (shitty) justifications for interning the Japanese.

Things like \"The Alien Land Law\" of 1913 and The Japanese Exclusion League of California were also instrumental in discrimination of Japanese Americans for years of come. \n\nIn summary, both Holocaust and Japanese internment are wrong and offensive.

Oscar Wilde went to prison for two years and was made a social pariah because of his conviction of homosexuality under gross indecency laws, which among other things, criminalized homosexuality. Sodomy was punishable by death in Britain until 1861 and afterwards by life in prison. \n\nThe other rather inaccurate post in this thread claims that [\"no one would ever accuse someone like the president of adultery\" in the 1800s](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/25i0e6/what_are_some_funny_dirty_nsfw_facts_from_history/chhl5yn), except for the fact that they totally did. Thomas Jefferson was accused of having an illegitimate child with his slave, Sally Hemmings; Andrew Jackson's wife was infamously accused of adultery because she was not technically divorced when her courtship with Jackson began; and Grover Cleveland was accused of fathering an illegitimate child (which he confessed to, and then proceeded to win the election anyway).
