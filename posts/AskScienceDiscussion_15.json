        "text": "https://www.worldreligionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/85acb7827abdbd83b2580f173ee2e784.jpg\n\nSo did the invention of religion have an evolutionary afvantage in the development of humans? \n\nWhy did Humans create religion? What evolutionary advantage did religion provide humans?\n\nReligion was a prehistoric development. There are no written records of it, and there is nothing in the archaeological record about it.\n\nSo in my own opinions, Here are my thoughts on this problem.\n\nReligion might've been a way for us to search for answers we dont know. For an era in early humans where we are exposed to the universe's version of the Hunger Games, and a time where humans know nothing about the natural world, Not only did it allow humans to think about the abstract and allowed intelligence to create superstitious ideas, but rather spiritual thinking in general.\n\nSo most scientists concluded it is part of our survival tools which prevent us from just killing and eating each other off as a species ..by inducing fear of a higher power or by leading us to join with others in common cause or whatever .\n\nOne question asked regarding it is did God create it , or did Nature . Did God create it so that we could recognise Him , or did nature create it so that we could Imagine a God , with the same effects and affects ?\n\n\n2. To keep tribe together, to enforce morals &amp; ethics in tribes by creating fear of something supreme in their minds. that’s how civilization formed. before major religions of today ancient tribes were also worshipping some prehistoric gods, nature etc. it is more related to psychological aspect of humans. fear is a ultimate weapon, if you used properly in good way it can bring tremendous results. intelligent of humans of back definitely know how to use to properly to keep their tribes together &amp; protect them from existential crisis\n\n3. It was a product of the search for answers. Why are we here, who created what we see, why is there good and evil, these are profound questions for which we need explanations but for which none exist. Because of that, we invented our own answers. We determined that there is a power above what we can explain or understand that is responsible for everything. Some called that power science; some called it god.\n\n4. In the course of mankind's development since this all-powerful force was acknowledged, there have been no evolutionary effects from that belief, god or science. What effects were caused by it were, and are, philosophical, technical, societal, all relating to how we live our lives, not at all related to who we have become.\n\n5. The fact that humans are conscious gives rise to fear of death, which is alleviated via religion(Terror Management theory, Greenberg)\nIn tribal society it bonded humans together\nGiven that religiosity is negatively correlated with intelligence, and wealth it would make sense that religion is also a coping mechanism for stressful events\n\nI believe that religions are basically formed to:\n\nBind a group together thru shared beliefs and a common purpose.\n\nTo answer questions that we cannot answer thru experience. Before the development of logic and later the scientific method, these were many and varied, for example Why does the sun come up in the morning and why does it get cold in the winter. Now the questions boil down to why do we have to die and what happens to us when we die.\nNotice that many religions seem to be hostile toward the other and help defend the group against outsiders. Also most religions are hostile to other beliefs and, thus, defend the religion in a group, maintaining the group’s cohesion (i.e. protecting the group.) Just sayin’. \n\nSo what are your opinions?",

Mammals and Primates are not necessary so long as the creatures can do those activities. \n\nI know that humans are not the top of the Tree of life and required some pretty special environmental conditions in order to come about. However, it also seems that life had a couple of stumbling blocks. First off all developing sexual reproduction, photosynthesis and oxygenating the atmosphere.

I was wondering if you upped the scale of that could you get full on rain storms in this indoor environment. If so would it matter if the environment was completely closed off? Does it need openings to the outside to get the proper conditions indoors? If say the environment inside was highly radioactive/contaminated, would that affect the rain?\n\nextra question: would a domed off environment like this produce any wind at all?",

A relative has been touting the benefits if these sessions and some other equally outlandish statements that I won't bother to repeat. I learned 30 some years ago in HS how to spot B.S. in print, but my background in science is nil. The following is from the [website](https://www.thequantumpulse.com/about.html) quantumpulse.\n\n&gt;The QuantumPulse is based on proven technologies and theories pioneered by scientists. We believe the QuantumPulse can promote and support general well-being.\n\n&gt;It is universally accepted that every atom in the universe has a frequency. The QuantumPulse uses a multi-wave oscillator and spectrum tubes containing noble and other gases to create frequencies that fall between the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum range. It also uses a coil (*originally stated Tesla coil, but now just coil**) to create high voltage and a subtle electromagnetic field. This combination produces biophotonic light. The electromagnetic field is used as a carrier to transmit the frequencies in a radius of approximately 6-8 feet around the machine.\n\n&gt;The new patented tuning capacitor sits atop the machine and produces alpha waves. The QuantumPulse produces a 90° phase shift between electrical and electromagnetic fields. The base of the machine is constructed of materials which block electrical fields, but allow electromagnetic fields to flow.\n\n&gt;Quantum mechanics is regarded by virtually every professional physicist as the most fundamental framework we have for understanding and describing nature, for the very practical reason that it works; it is “in the nature of things”. It is, in fact, an entity related to both energy and momentum of elementary particles and of photons.*\n\nThe first paragraph is a net full of red herring to me and reminds me of the footbath pulling toxins from the body scam. The claim is this V.I.B.E. gizmo restores balance at the cellular level. \n\nIf anyone could please point out the reality or fallacies from a scientific POV, aside from the obvious vagueness and misdirection of facts and claims. I'm worried my relative might buy one of these $18,000 \"machines\". Thank you.",

It will not be suitable for all situations and that is okay.\n\nI found out about the Light L16. It uses several small lenses and sensors to get the equivalent of one large sensor. The problem is that it uses fixed focal length lenses. There are groups of lenses with the same focal length and different options. The camera crops instead of having continuous focal length adjustment. I am curious if making adjustable focal length lenses without the helicoid principle will help. For background, there is a rare Minolta 40-80 f/2.8 lens that is without the helicoid principle. It uses a rotating wheel on the side. It is optically superior to comparable modern zooms and lower weight. If adjustable focal length lenses could be made for this without the helicoid principle, can a motor adjust the focal length without making the camera too bulky? Will a continuous adjustable aperture and auto focusing be feasible with a group of non helicoid zoom lenses covering a group of small sensors. Is close focusing possible? What is a good solution to allow filters like polarizers to be installed?\n\nI want to implement analog gamma compression. I read studies about prototype chip based sensors with this technology. I want to improve ISO invariance, lower the effects of downstream noise, and improve underexposure tolerance. One prototype demonstrated a range of about 18.5 stops with a 12 bit ADC and a gamma compression factor of about 2.9. My system will have a 12 bit ADC with a gamma compression factor of 3. This fits 3 stops of dynamic range into the top 50% (unlike a linear curve in which the top 50% has 1 stop).\n\nI want to use an electronic shutter as expected. I want to enable a flash sync speed of 1/8000 of a second. How fast would the readout need to be for that to be possible without artifacts? What components could be added to LED light and xenon flash to prevent harsh effects like red eye?\n\nIs a continuous variable ND filter possible?\n\nWhat is a good open source real time OS that can be used? The Light L16 uses a general purpose OS. I want one that will allow any modifications to fix bugs. What are ways to prevent bugs? Will inspecting the code repeatedly before testing help? Users are more forgiving of missing features than programing errors.\n\nI want the end image to be a native square. I want to make models that have area equivalents of 24x24mm, 36x36mm, and 54x54mm. Would it be more effective to use groups with larger sensors, more sensors of the same size, or a compromise?\n\nI want to design the RAW format to have the image combination and demosaicing done before saving to card. With lossy RAW video, it can use interframe interpolation or be intra only. I will make an optional dedicated external unit for RAW processing. In the rendering phase of color editing, the files will be 12 bits per channel with calculations using 16 or 32 bits per channel. Because ICC profiles and LUTs are destructive, they will be applied at the end of the rendering phase and only be used for preview during editing.\n\nWhat thoughts and ideas do you have?

You can send seed to grow food and then maybe even grow your own seeds, etc. But, what about medicine? You can send some, but eventually you're going to run out. You can send equipment, but eventually equipment breaks or wears out. E.g. the dentist brings a couple of those scraper things, some material for fillings, that teeth cleaning paste, etc. What happens when he runs out of filling material or paste?  \n\nSpeaking of the dentist, I read somewhere that the ideal number of people to put on this type of a mission is around 96. It minimizes the risk that the population will die out before it reaches the planet and balances the resources needed for the trip. So, you've got a dentist, probably an Internist whose also hematology and oncology, a general surgeon, an eye doctor, orthopedic surgeon, pediatrician, endocrinologist, obgyn, psychologist, psychiatrist, physical therapist, massage therapist, chiropractor and a dozen nurses. What happens if the dentist needs dental work? So I'm guessing you cross-train all the physicians in two other specialties. So that's 25 medical people. A dozen astronauts to fly and operate the ship. We've got room for 59 more. What other occupations do we need? We won't need them right away, but child care in a year and elementary education in five years.",

For example:\n\n* What if we need to make observations near the Planck length/energy to ever see any concrete evidence of new physics? E.x. requiring a particle collider that is practically impossible to build?\n\n* What if our small pocket of observable universe forever limits our ability to understand the universe at large?\n\n* What if it's impossible to deduce the nature of dark energy without an older universe, where its effects have had more time to manifest?\n\nHow likely do you think it is that humanity just gets stuck at our current level of theoretical physics forever?",

Im assuming a lot of heat is lost as the light travels from the sun to earth?",
