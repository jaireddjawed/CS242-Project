        "text": "I have been at my current job since April, and we use environmentally friendly cardboard pens. Since the day I started, all of my pens have had black ink. I know this for a fact because all of my notes since the day I started were written in black ink.\n\nThe week before last, my pen was suddenly writing in blue ink. This could easily be explained by the fact that our suppliers are now sending out pens with blue cartridges and I picked up one of those without realising. However, as our pens are made out of cardboard instead of plastic, I can easily identify my usual pen by a particular dent on the side, so I was certain it was the same pen. Also, we have not had a new batch of stationary for over 2 months.\n\nI decided to just keep using it, even though the other pen on my desk was still writing in black. And yet, my pen has now changed itself back to black ink. I know I am not imagining this as I still have some notes and customer amendments which I have written in blue ink.\n\nI have not seen anyone else's writing in blue ink since the day I started. I also think it is highly unlikely that anyone would have gone to the trouble of finding a rare blue pen, disassembling my pen, switching the ink barrels, then switching them back several days later. Does anyone have a logical explanation for this?",

        "text": "So I haven't really posted here, as I'm usually more of a lurker.  Anyway, my story is small but still stumps me to this day. But don't expect anything overly amazing or head scratching, it is what it is.\n\nI was living in Florida at the time, I was seventeen and attending a new school for a few months already. Each morning, I would get up after turning off my obnoxious alarm clock and begin getting ready for the school day.\n\nNow, I feel like I should tell you that I have a really bad issue with anxiety, especially when it comes to being somewhere on time. I start getting ready two hours earlier than I need to, so I don't feel like I have to rush, but unfortunately I get the rushed feeling no matter how early I wake up. \n\nSo, as usual, I got up at 5 AM and grab a shower, then check my phone for the time. I get dressed, check the time. I do my makeup, do a time check about every ten minutes or so. So at this point, it's safe to say that I'm checking the time pretty damn often.  \n\nI finish getting ready, and watch my phone clock change to 7AM, and I grab my school bag and head out. As I'm walking the half mile to the bus stop, I'm noticing it's still dark as shit which was super weird, but I trudge on. I get closer to the bus stop, and notice that there are sprinklers on, which was odd cause I'd never seen them on at this time in the morning. \n\nWeird.\n\nSo I get to the stop, and no one is there. I look around for a minute, and wait. About five minutes pass, and it's still dark, and it doesn't seem like a single person is even stirring in the houses around me. Worriedly, I check my phone clock again.\n\nIt reads 2:37 AM. \n\nMy vision tunnels, and I blink a few times and look back at the clock again. Still 2:37 AM. Not even close to the time I left. \n\nIf you remember, I WATCHED my clock change to 7 before I headed out. I took two hours to get ready, and didn't even feel slightly tired, so I know I wasn't just too tired to read the clock correctly or possibly dreaming. \n\nI walk back home, and all the lights were off, even the porch, and my makeup and other products I used to get ready were completely untouched. The shower was bone dry, but my hair was still wet. It was as if I had never really got ready. Yet, the makeup on my face and my clean clothes, wet hair, EVERYTHING pointed to the fact that I had. \n\nI've heard of losing time, but to this day I still don't really know what the hell happened. Nothing like this happened before that moment, or after, but I still get weirded out thinking back on it.",

Angels ? And then he has to go through his life review to feel what he did to others throughout his life, the good and the bad ?”\n\nOmega: “Yeah, what about it ?”\n\nBracer: “This is wrong.”\n\nOmega: “Why ?”\n\nBracer: “Put yourself in God’s shoe for a moment.”\n\nOmega: “Yeah, have always been here, go on...”\n\nBracer: “...”\n\nOmega: “Go on...”\n\nBracer: “Alright, so you want to play the God role now right ? Good, that will make it very easy for me, because now I can call it to your face.”\n\nOmega: “And what would that be ?”\n\nBracer: “That you...are...a...fucking...asshole...with...a...superior complex...that gets high...on judging people...to make yourself feel that you are “better“ then everyone else.”\n\nOmega: “That’s quite a judgment, you should be God ! You are pretty good at the things you are accusing me of doing, and that’s not the first time, ha ha ha”\n\nBracer: “Shut up, stop laughing, I am serious.”\n\nOmega: “Voice out your issues my tiny minion !” [Omega said with his hands on his hip mocking my concept of a judgmental God]\n\nBracer: “In the video, he said that during our life here, we don’t know to what extend we hurt or blessed people, and that we will be up to speed with everything that we have done here when we die and SUFFER the consequences AND the blessings of our actions, he mentioned that had we known fully to what extend our actions would impact other souls while they too, were in physical form, we would be a much better person and carry out our actions quite differently.”\n\nOmega: “Get to the point Bracer.”\n\nBracer: “Well, if that is the case, then maybe God should design this fucking game a little better ? Like, I don’t know, make it so that while we were here in physical form, we don’t FUCKING FORGET that we are forever and also RETAIN the ability to have the power to know what our actions are doing to others and all the other powers we “suddenly regained” when we go through the life review.”\n\nOmega: “Continue...”\n\nBracer: “The point is, had we HAD the tools we had during our life review moment while we were in physical form, a.k.a playing the game, we WOULDN’T NEED a life review.”\n\nOmega: “Listening...”\n\nBracer: “The only reason we are STRIPPED of those abilities is so that we, in our ignorance and lack of universal awareness, WILL do acts FOR survival and the likes so that when we die, God in his mighty throne or the council of elders [slaves of Gods who also kinda suffers from superior complex that probably feel orgasm from judging others because it makes them feel good, sick sick people...].”\n\nOmega: “Interesting perspective.”\n\nBracer: “It’s like amputating a living creature and then JUDGE the creature for screaming in pain. This is sick and this is wrong.”\n\nOmega: “So who is at fault here ?”\n\nBracer: “God ! He be like “Hmmm, I have a ticklish need to feel superior...I shall create creatures that know not of the full impact of their actions so that they can live their life in ignorant and then BLAME THEM AND JUDGE THEM for their ignorant when they die by giving them that ability to then know FULL WELL what they have done”. Well Mr. God maybe if you GAVE THEM that ability in the first place, they wouldn’t do it in the first place have you ever thought about that ?!!! and God will probably be like “but...how can I judge them then ? I have a DEEP NEED to feel superior...the councils of angels or whatever the fuck those superior fucks like to call themselves too, like to feel superior, where then would we go and get our *superiority fix*[like a drug addiction] ?” ”\n\nOmega: “Are you not afraid you will face the consequences of judging these “supposed” energies you will meet right after you die ?”\n\nBracer: “I already live in fear for the most part while I am on Earth, thinking about when I would run out of money to eat, when I would be homeless, whether I would die in slow agonizing pain, you could say I am just about had it if after I die I have to face the fear of being judge ! How dare God or the council of fuck angels think they are in ANY position to judge me ! Fuck them ! Of course with their “powers” they *could* do stuff to me, but that is through fear, don’t expect me to submit to a God *willingly* that uses fear to even so much as to persuade me to do anything.”\n\nOmega: “Guess I will have to use another method then huh ? ha ha ha”\n\nBracer: “I mean of course if enough fear is instilled in my heart, soul or whatever, God could literally remote control me to do anything, but my heart will NEVER be won that way, it will NEVER happen because it’s all done out of survival, out of fear.”\n\nOmega: “You...you think I am trying to win your heart ? What are you the golden standard of souls that I NEED you at my throne ? You think very highly of yourself Mr. Bracer.”\n\nBracer: “Ok, so are you saying you don’t need me ?”\n\nOmega: “I don’t “need” anyone; I “Love”, not “need” ”.\n\nBracer: “Well if you “love” them, give everyone a break and stop putting them in situations where you can judge them ! Don’t remove abilities from souls like preventing them from knowing everything and then BLAME THEM for actions carried out as a result of not knowing everything.”\n\nOmega: “I didn’t.”\n\nBracer: “What ?”\n\nOmega: “I didn’t judge anyone, I give you all existence because you are all an extension of me, and you are all to live as you please.”\n\nBracer: “What ?”\n\nOmega: “And not to be mean, but you are kinda WRONG when you say I removed your ability to know everything there is to know.”\n\nBracer: “Then WHY do I not remember who I was ? Why did I not have the ability to do whatever I want ? Do you know how many times I asked to go to sleep and NEVER fucking wake up to this cruel world ?”\n\nOmega: “You’ve opened a bag of worms there, one issue at a time Mr. Bracer.”\n\nBracer: “...”\n\nOmega: “Bracer, do you remember I told you many MANY times this is not the real world ? I even used a term that you in your present era would understand, this world that you are currently aware you are being on is, to use your term, a simulation, and and and...,it is NOT created directly by me even though since all IS one, you could say it is by me but just to be clear, it is not directly created by me. Blaming me for the way this simulation works would be like blaming your great grand grand grand father for what you have created now since technically, he did create you.”\n\nBracer: “So who created this ?”\n\nOmega: “Let’s go faster, change *who* to *why*.”\n\nBracer: “Why was this created...hmm...since this is not directly created by you...then this is created by a sick bunch of spirits who created and then self appoint themselves as the judger of this simulation....”\n\nOmega: “Well, the creator doesn’t necessarily have to be the judger, like for examples you can have internet forums created by one or a group of people but they too also assign moderators to moderate specific forum sections, the moderators does not necessarily have to be the very people who created the forum.”\n\nBracer: “Those sick bustards...”\n\nOmega: “Wait wait...I am not done yet.”\n\nBracer: “?”\n\nOmega: “You chose to be here...”\n\nBracer: “NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\nOmega: “YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!”\n\nBracer: “NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\nOmega: “YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!”\n\nBracer: “What kind of an imbecile idiot spirit do I have to be to voluntarily come into this simulation, forget everything, be stripped of my all knowing power, die and then allow myself to be subjugated to being JUDGED by the actions I carried out when I didn’t know who I am.”\n\nOmega: “Or maybe...you are NOT an imbecile idiot spirit...”\n\nBracer: “But that would mean...I came down here KNOWING that I will forget everything and that I will carry out actions from a stand point of not knowing that I am universal infinite spirit...”\n\nOmega, smiled at me.\n\nOmega: “You got it my child...you are here to know who you really are without your powers...”\n\nI looked at Omega, looked back at all the good and bad things I have done [mostly bad things] and I suddenly felt like crying...\n\nI kept my tears and strengthen myself and said to Omega:\n\nBracer: “But how dare those imbeciles try to judge me, I put myself here, I will judge myself, or NOT judge myself, I do whatever I want !”\n\nOmega: “It always has been that way dude; it always has been that way.”\n\nBracer: “But that dude in Youtube talks about being surrounded by spirits that judges him and stuff.”\n\nOmega: “That dude, like every other dude, is full of half truths, you are full of half truths too, maybe try to bring your questions to me directly next time instead of being all angry trying to find things out from the internet from some dude ?”\n\nBracer: “M’kay...”\n\nOmega: “but but but, don’t confused the probable reason for why you are here with anyone else’s. Every soul exist here in this particular *simulation*, one out of MANY varieties [to use your words] for its own specific reason(s), sometimes there might be some kind of broad consensus, but broad doesn’t mean “right” or “wrong”, just leave every soul to do its own thing, you do yours.”\n\nBracer: “M’kay.”",

My childhood is riddled with supernatural events and key moments about my life that are not true now here today. \n\nOne in particular is remembering with utter certainty that my mother took me to a funeral of a man she told me was my father and about a year or two later, I was boarding a plane with my mother on my way to..you guessed it...meet my father. I used to play with dead relatives as a child and even had secret “worlds” I could wish myself to and play there for hours. \n\nI frequently now get over whelming nostalgia about the 80’s specifically maybe early 90’s but my memories are of a much older retired self. I have feelings and flashes of being elderly in the 80s/90s and can recall things I did and what my house looks like. Oddly enough I also fully remember being a child and can vividly recall tons of things. My memory of that time period seems to be of two separate people. \n\nI’m clearly nowhere near elderly now so I clearly could never have been back then. I’ve always joked that I can’t wait to be a Grandma because I’ve just always loved the idea of being old and retired. I’m a young women who wears make up, gets my nails done and wears high heels so my friends think it’s so funny like I’m not afraid of aging and cannot wait to be old lol. \n\nThere was also a classmate I know for a fact was replaced by another classmate with the same name and in the beginning everyone else knew too. Now that we are all adults, no one remembers but me.  I’ve even brought it up to my childhood best friends who was with me in 5th grade when it happened and we were both side by side questioning this “imposter” girl. She would only say “why does everyone keep asking me that”. They have all forgotten when she changed but I didn’t. The other girl was my friend and we played together after school. The last time I saw her, I left my bike at her house. When the new girl showed up I decided to prove I wasn’t making it up by walking to her house to get my bike back. There was no bike and the house was abandoned.\n\nThere are far too many other strange things to list here but I think you guys get the idea. Was I just slipping in and out of realities when I was a kid or what. I have other reasons to believe my mother is behind some of this. Not directly but...I’ve always had a weird feeling my existence is supposed to be hidden or something. If this means anything to anyone, please reach out! Thank you ",

        "text": "So this all started when i was still in school. I was in class as usual when some guy that i didn't even know that wasn't in the same class or grade as me knocked on the classroom door in the middle of a lesson and he was holding a big cardboard sign that said \"I love you.\" and some sort of hand garnet thing. It was for me. I was of course flattered and slightly embarrassed. To not seem rude, i took those things and thanked him for the stuff. When it was time to go home, i took those things with me and put them next to my bed. One day however, i went to school, did school things, yadda yadda. But something was VERY off. Remember that big cardboard sign? It was gone. There's no way in hell i could lose a big ass cardboard sign that had been exactly in the same place before. However, me being a unaware carefree kid, shrugged this off as i happened to be one of those little brats that check out a book and end up never returning them or losing them, so i thought that was the case. This is the part where shit gets strange. I asked my friend about who the boy could've been, they only replied with \"What boy?\". Of course i thought they were just joking around.\n\n\n\nThat was until it was apparent that nobody remembered the boy, not even the teacher. This made me uncomfortable to say the least, but it just proceeded to go even more downhill as it turns out that even my parents didn't remember the boy. And the strange thing was i barely remembered him too. I completely forgot what he looked like even though i'd just met him a few days ago.\n\n\n\nBut it just happened that the boy was no longer in that school. It wasn't like he moved schools, no no no, it was like he never ever went to that school in the first place.\n\n\n\nI still haven't heard from him to this very day.\n\n\nUpdate of information i left out. The people who were in the class saw the boy and were completely aware of him, they remembered him for until the day he disappeared, meaning they saw the boy, and were aware of his presence, with some of the kids even teasing me about the fact that someone seemingly had a crush on me. I don't know how the fuck this sort of thing could happen and i had to put this information in because it freaked me the fuck out once i remembered it.",

I wore them a lot, like so much that eventually they got a hole in the leg where my thighs would touch. I was so upset, I tried to get the same jeans again but they were sold out! Then they weren't on sale anymore.\nI remember being kind of upset because all my other jeans weren't quite right and I couldn't repair the rip, I tried and it just tore again. So eventually, I just threw them in a drawer and thought, maybe I can keep them for painting or something.\nSo, in the drawer they sat for months, I moved house and everything, that's how long I didn't touch them for.\nThen the other day, I went through my drawers and realised something was funky and had funked up the rest of my clothes, so I just decided to wash all my clothes.   My wonderful husband, then did a couple of loads and today I found he'd washed and folded up my torn jeans for me to put away.  I wasn't doing anything today so I was like, I'll wear them today but then I should really throw them out.  \n\nWell, I put them on and there's no rip!  There's not even the stitching from when I tried to fix them.  The denim is totally in-tact! It's like they've never been ripped!  I know it was these jeans which were torn because they have little studs down the sides of them, none of my other jeans have this.  \nI've been wearing them all day and feeling around for a tear or stitching, there's absolutely nothing! I even took them and turned them inside out to have a good look, even had my husband have a look, they're a totally intact pair of jeans!\n\nI know they were ripped because I remember how bummed I was that I wouldn't be able to wear them anymore. Even my husband remembers this.\nIt's weird for me.\n\nAgain, not the best story, but it's what happened.",

        "text": "Just saying this in advance: sorry for the messy and probably confusing Text, english isnt my native language (german here). This didnt happen to me but to my ex girlfriend (lets call her Leyla for anonymity) around 2 years ago. I still cant wrap my head around what happened. She worked as a waitress in a pizza place. Its kind of a branch store thingy and there are multiple pizza places with the same name in our city. She worked in pizza place A with her superior (lets call her Anna) and then theres pizza place B with the owner of the whole thing (call her Laura).\n\nSo one day Leyla was working in pizza place A when Laura 1 (yes \"Laura 1\", this will make more sense later on) called her (from pizza place B) on the store phone downstairs (office with another phone is upstairs). Laura said she just talked to Anna on the phone 1 minute ago but the connection got Interrupted and now the line is busy and she cant reach Anna. So Leyla decides to take the phone upstairs and just give it to Anna. She knocks on Annas door and enters the office with Anna being on the upstairs telephone already. Leyla says to Anna that she has Laura on the phone and that she wants to speak to Anna again because their connection got interrupted. Anna gives her a confused look and says to Leyla that this has to be a joke, because she is already on the phone with Laura (in this case this would be Laura 2), and she got called back 10 minutes ago because the connection got interrupted and that she is speaking to her right now. Leyla laughs and asks Laura 1 on the phone if this is some kind of prank, to which Laura 1 replies in a strict tone that it is not and she wants to speak to Anna again. Leyla hands the phone to Anna saying that Laura 1 wants to speak to her. Anna is super confused and asks the person on the upstairs phone \"who the fuck am i talking to? Is this not Laura?\" to which Laura 2 replies that ofcourse it is Laura. Anna takes a deep breath and says \"ok what the hell, lets put them both on the telephone loudspeaker.\" So they both place their phones with loudspeakers activated on the table. Silence.\n\n  Then Laura 1 asks \"Who is this?\".\n\n  Laura 2: \"This is Laura\".\n\n  Laura 1: \"What? Well this is Laura aswell can i please talk to Anna? Our connection got interrupted\". \n\n  Laura 1: \"What the hell is going on here? This is my voice on the other phone?!\".\n\n  Laura 2: \"Can i please talk to Anna again, i dont have time for this\".  \n\n\nAnna and Leyla dont say a word because they just cant understand whats happening right nos. In  panic mode, Anna takes both phones and hangs up. Anna and Leyla discussed what just happened and confirm to each other that they recognized their Laura on the phone by voice and behaviour. And that they both heard what just happened. There were 2 Lauras on the phone, talking to each other. They both had a Laura on the phone, speaking to them simultaneously. From Annas perspective, when Leyla entered the office with Laura 1 on the line, she had been on the phone with Laura 2 for around 15 minutes but their connection got interrupted 10 minutes before. But Laura 2 called Anna back immediately. So 10 minutes after Laura 2 called back, Leyla enters her office with another Laura on the phone, claiming that she was disconnected and wants to speak to Anna again. \n\nAfter a while of trying to comprehend what exactly just happened they called back Laura. She explained the situation from the p.o.v. of Laura 2 and that she doesnt know what just happened and that she somehow heard her voice on the other telephone.\n\nThey didnt really talk about what happened from there on. They never figured out what exactly happened. Any ideas? Btw. i didnt confuse this with nosleep, this really happened. Feel free to ask any questions. ",

I was thinking about a road that we were going to pass and was going to mention to my grandma this cool lakehouse next to a man-made lake up the hill, where you would not expect a lake to be. As we began to near the road I saw a short and skinny figure standing next to the mailboxes belonging to the houses up that road. The figure was standing abnormally still and didn't look like it had any hair, but just a large potato-y head. I commented to my grandma saying, \"What is that? Ugh\" I was a bit creeped out that someone would construct that there, like a leftover Halloween decoration or something. The figure looked pretty creeptastic and was staring right down the road. I put my eyes back on the road because the road curved and when I looked back the figure moved, and it was a girl! Still staring right at us. I was so startled I said \"Oh my gosh! I thought that was a scarecrow or something!\"\n\nJust pretty odd especially as I really thought her head looked like a hair-less, feature-less potato.",

And it was possible because I have an innate talent at instantly learning the basics of everything.  \n  \nNow I have to warn you that this can cause you to slightly phase out of sync with the matrix, this can affect you in many ways: from just being tired, to feeling ill for weeks, to death in extreme cases(if you try to modify the surroundings too much).  \n  \nNow to the point:  \nTo start of you need to have experience with dejavus, the more you had the better. After that you need to achieve a confortable level of lucid dreaming. This is were the difficult part starts: you know when you drean in somewhat a 3rd person view? Yes you have to \"spawn\" your subconcious in a lucid dream while also being in there(basically making your subconcious a copy of yourself in a dream you are already in, don't try this if you are mentally unstable). After that you can interact with your subconcious-self and you have 2 options: the first option is to make him/her teach you how to control your body(that's where the mild superpowers come from, I personally control my eyes better, hearth beat rate and lactic acid production so I can be more efficent during physical activities), notice that this control is like breathing, if you don't concentrate at it it just goes as if you didn't have any control over it. The second option is to \"absorb\"/\"assimilate\" him/her. This is more risky because you basically obtain everything and can be overwhelmed with informations.\n  \nAnother option is to modify/predict the future, be ware that this is extremly dangerous and can lead to death if abused: like before you have to do a lucid dream, but this time you decide to dream a dejavu(extremly dofficult). In the dejavu you have to notice something special that activates the dejavu irl(the sensation in normal dejavu), you shouldn't change anything in the dream, just notice something that allows you to recall and remember your dream once it occurs. That is because you nkrmally always forget dejavus.  \n  \nNow that you had a \"clearly dreamt dejavu\", you have unlocked your mind and can send informations to the matrix, aka modify dejavus and realty. The scale of the modification affects the consequences on you: you modify to find 5cents on the ground, nothing; you find 5 dollars, you'll be tired for a couple days, you make yourself find 1million, you die. Notice that I only got to a point where I was ill, but with the lucid dream you can always simulate/theorize the results of a modification. Paradoxes will always make your dream not a dejavu. Make your modofication reversable by making them in advance and \"redreamable\" so you can make a paradox to nullify them.  \n  \n  \nTldr: Lucid dream, subconcious, take control of your body and mind.  \nLucid dream, dejavu, modify it.",

        "text": "At various points in my life, I have experienced overwhelming deja vu--mostly in regards to books. In middle school or high school, I was part of a teen book club. About 2/3 of the way into the book, I suddenly \"remembered\" everything that happened from there to the last page... of a book I'd never read before. This has happened on multiple occasions, but I'm going to share the one that makes the least sense. (By the way, I now use GoodReads to keep track of every book I've ever read, just to keep an eye on this as much as possible.)\n\nWhen I was in high school, I picked up the \"Twilight\" series. It was so easy to breeze through that I read all 3 of the ones that had been published over a 3-day weekend (MLK, Jr. Day). That summer, the final book (\"Breaking Dawn\") was going to be released. I decided to go with my mom to the midnight release party at our local Barnes &amp; Noble. I even dressed up for a contest... as the only person who came as Bella Swan herself (Sorry, it was way too easy as a teenage girl with brown hair and a character with no defining characteristics at all).\n\nAs soon as I got the book and the festivities were over, I took it home and began to read. About a third of the way through, I came across a page that I was certain I had read before, word-for-word. It was the one where Jacob imprints on the baby as soon as she is born, and I know I'd seen it in exactly those words and looked precisely how it did on the page.\n\n(This is probably about 100 pages after the magic broke for me and I realized how terrible the books were. I *promise* that it is 100% unnecessary to tell me how crappy \"Twilight\" is, because I *know* it sucks. Pun intended. It's been almost 10 years since I liked the series, so don't worry.)\n\n**It makes zero sense for me to have read a specific page of a book that was only 2 hours old at the time of reading.** The next section of the book was also very familiar, but I decided to take that as the book being highly derivative of others I've read before.\n\nDoes anyone else \"remember\" books they've never read?",

        "text": "So I'm new to Reddit, and I have no idea how this works, but I'm going to share some experiences of what I think are glitches in the matrix or just dreams or everyday occurrences that happen to everyone, from most recent to ones in the past. \nOne of the most recent ones actually just happened. I just joined Reddit literally less than five minutes ago, but I feel like I've already joined. I swear I made an account with my personal email, the one I used for this account, and when I tried to use the username I was planning on using, it told me it was already taken. It sounds stupid, but I am so confused. Is this a glitch in the matrix or could I have just joined reddit a while ago, but I forgot I did?\nAnother one is a little more serious, and it happened when I was a junior in high school. One day while in the car listening to music, I had a daydream that my mom and brother got into a fender bender  on their way home from church. As I daydreamed about this, my music suddenly stopped. I was in the middle of listening to a song, and I know I didn't pause it. I only pause my music if I absolutely have to. My headphones weren't broken, either. After a few seconds, everything went back to normal. When I got home, I texted my friend and I told him what happened. He told me that I was just daydreaming, and everything would be fine. After talking to him about it, I felt reassured and shrugged it off. The next evening, while my mom and brother were on their way home from church, they got into a fender bender at a stoplight at a major highway. Thankfully, no one was hurt, and the car only suffered a dent. \nThese are probably just dreams, but they're quite odd, which leads me to believe that they're either a glitch in the matrix or just really vivid dreams. I started getting them when I was in my freshman year of high school. While I was in high school, I would often get dreams about missing the bus. In my dream, I'd wake up to my brother telling me that if I didn't get ready fast, we'd miss the bus because we only had ten minutes to get there. It took me ten minutes to get ready on a normal morning, and the bus stop was a five minute walk from my house, so I was really rushing in those dreams. I would run down the street just as I was missing the bus. Right as it passed me, I would wake up to my brother telling me that we'd miss the bus if we weren't at the bus stop in ten minutes. Now that I've graduated, the scenario is a little different. I have the same kind of dream sometimes, but it's about work, and what happens when I wake up kind of varies. The time it stood out to me most was in September. I was house sitting for a family friend at the time, and my mom had told me that she'd take me to work Saturday morning. I had a dream the night before that I was waking up to my alarm. I got out of bed and got ready for work. I heard the alarm go off again, and I thought I hadn't pressed stop at first. I found myself waking up to my mom calling me and telling me that I'd be late for work if I slept in any longer. I'm sorry this is so long, but if anyone with any experiences with this kind of stuff PLEASE tell me what's going on? \nEdit: About the dreams, they would only happen if I was about to miss the bus or if I was almost late to work. They didn't happen any other time. \nAnother edit: I just tried logging in with the username and password that I thought I had originally used for a different reddit account, but they don't seem to exist at all.

In the movie the writer stayed in the evil room, once the night finished he sets it on fire once the clock starts repeating. I SPECIFICALLY remember a scene where he is on a couch with his estranged wife near him, he then plays the tape recorder where you hear the conversation between him and his dead daughter. More recently I watched it again. This time apparently he didn’t escape the fire but his ex heard the tape recorder from a box of things pulled from the fire.\n\nI thought my memory may have just been a bit off until just now.\n\nThe Butterfly Effect (again, more spoilers) is on Stan in Australia (Netflix competitor). I have always always always remember the ending, he hides under the desk, watches his birth video, goes back to the womb and kills himself like the three sibilants before him did. Now I just watched it and when he watched the video it was at a birthday party where he basically tells kayleigh to fuck off and then everyone has normal happy lives.\n\nI totally understand that some movies have alternate endings but do they actively get swapped out over rereleases? I thought all movies had the exact same endings right now as they did in the movies..\n\nAm I losing my fucking mind or does anyone else remember these endings also?",

        "text": "Hey there, first time actually posting on Reddit.\n\nI’d like to share a dream and subsequent experience I had in my childhood. I don’t know if it exactly qualifies as a “glitch” story, but whatever. Just hear me out.\n\nWhen I was really young, my sisters had just moved out to college so I had just inherited their upstairs bedroom in our house. The walls were the MOST obnoxious shade of cotton-candy pink conceivable. I hated it, but having my own room made up for it. Just remember the wall color because it will come in later. Also at this time my family had an old blue fabric recliner in the living room downstairs. It rested directly below the stairs. Remember the recliner too. \n\nAround that time, I had a particularly vivid dream one night, though I suppose it was more of a nightmare. I dreamed that I woke up in my room and sat up in my bed. I looked across the room to see a strange man standing in the opposite corner of the room as the bed. Behind him the walls were a gentle and warm shade of green, not the familiar pink. As I became aware of the danger this stranger possessed in my room, I leapt out of bed and ran for the doorway to the small hall that contained the stairway. He chased after me but missed and smashed into my bedroom wall. I bolted down the stairs and got about 2/3 down before jumping to the bottom and landing on my back. I looked back up the stairs to see the guy at the top starting his descent. I clambered up and dashed around the stairs and ran into the recliner. Except this was not the blue recliner. It was a white recliner with a white microfiber exterior. As I recovered from slamming into the recliner, I looked back to see the stranger finishing his descent of the stairs. I began to run again down the downstairs hallway and could hear his footsteps gaining on mine, coming closer. I made it to the end of the hall and busted into the bathroom, where I found my parents standing and talking to each other nonchalantly. I quickly closed and locked the door as an overwhelming feeling of peace and comfort flooded me. At that moment I woke up. The next morning I told my mom about the nightmare in great detail. I distinctly remember telling her about how the walls were a different color and the chair was new. I was a long and painful storyteller as a kid and got hung up on every detail. Spoiler alert: I still do.\n\nIt was a seemingly run of the mill childhood nightmare. I was scared, but then I found my parents and woke up. Big deal. But two details made it more than just some dreams for me, and more of a story I couldn’t explain. The walls. The chair.\n\nAnyway, fast forward a few years. After much complaining, I had my parents repaint the walls from the pink it was, and selected a warm green for the new color. Not far apart chronologically, my parents came home one day from the store with a new chair to replace the old blue one. It was a white microfiber recliner. One day as I walked across the living room and bumped into the white recliner, I was flooded by deja vu. It was a few minutes before I realized why, before I remembered the dream I had years ago. As I remembered the dream, I also remembered the wall color that I had dreamt, and realized that it was the same color that I had my walls painted as. I was beyond confused. I started asking family and friends about what they thought about it, but they were mostly uninterested. I never let it go though. Had I had a prophetic dream? Did I see into the future? Did I misremember it all? What could explain such an occurrence? \n\nSo now, more than 10 years later, still occasionally bugged by it, I come to you, Reddit, for theories and suggestions. I have my own. I suppose that for the wall color I either retroactively rewrote my memory of the dream with the green walls and they were never there in the dream in the first place (unlikely because I do remember that I told my mom about them the morning after the dream), was always was partial to that color and I subconsciously was drawn to it all along (most likely imo), or was unknowingly prophesying the future (least likely imo). The chair is trickier, since I never knew it was going to be purchased, nor was I there for the purchase. I have no idea for that one myself. How did it appear in my dream so long before? Was it a sort of “glitch”?\n\nI should mention that I have had no similar experiences before or since, dreaming or awake. This dream was the only time. \n\nSo, thoughts? \n\n\nBONUS EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO’VE READ THIS FAR: Once while I was walking to class during last semester, I walked through a crosswalk and was minding my business on the other side when suddenly I was back in the crosswalk from ~3 seconds earlier and was still walking to the other side. I didn’t know what to make of it. If it was Deja vu, it was the strongest Deja vu I’ve ever encountered. It was like I had to relive 3 of the most mundane seconds of my life.\n\nThat’s all I’ve got. Thanks.\n",

        "text": "So after having lived just over 19 years, essentially, my entire life, in this house, my family decides to buy a way nicer house and move in. The old and new houses were about a mile apart. Oftentimes during the day, after the initial move, I'd cruise back over to the old house and load up stuff to move. So one day, I'm in the middle of driving to the old house, when I pull up at an intersection. I notice a gray Toyota SUV (Highlander maybe?) in front of me, as well as a huge white lifted Dodge Ram in front of the Toyota. Due to oncoming thru traffic, the three of us sat there and waited to turn left. By the time I had just entered the intersection, the light turned red and I completed my turn. \n\nSo I go get stuff and bring it to the new place, and decide it's time for round 2. Here's where things get weird; I pull up to the same intersection, and again, gray Toyota SUV and white Ram pickup are in front of me. They look to be identical to the cars I was just behind previously. I'm almost certain that the truck was, especially. Again, wait for traffic to clear before proceeding with the turn. Just as before, they'd gone, I followed, and the light turned red when I'd entered the intersection. I'm not sure if this was paranormal, a glitch, or just an extremely odd coincidence. Both incidents happened within 20 minutes of each other.\n\nTL; DR\nMade the same turn at the same intersection with the same two cars in front of me on two separate occasions within 20 minutes of each other.",

I was struggling to control my boat with the levers until my son told me, \"Mum, they are like tank controls\" - he didn't elaborate any further, but I knew exactly how to use them as soon as he said that! Now, my son plays a lot of video games, including emulators, so he could have got the information of how tanks are operated from there, or maybe from his dad who is an engineer.\n\nI don't play video games, neither have I ever taken any interest in tanks, yet I immediately knew exactly what to do.

        "text": "I gave this post a tongue-in-cheek title but what follows is entirely true. I consider myself a sober, rational-minded person, and I honestly have no explanation for this. \n\nMy girlfriend and I recently drove cross-country to move from Boston to LA. About a week ago, we stopped in Yuma, Arizona, to get some coffee at a Starbucks. A few seconds after parking, I realized I didn't have my keys. It seemed weird to me, but being an absent-minded person, I assumed I had taken them out and dropped them on the floor without noticing. I did a quick search and couldn't find them so I grabbed the spare from my glove box and decided to look later. After all, they couldn't have gone very far since I hadn't even opened my car door at this point.\n\nWe go inside, get our coffee, come out and I do another quick search. Nothing. Oh well, I think, they're probably lodged somewhere I can't see, but once we get to LA, I'll be able to conduct a better search. \n\nWe get to LA. I look in every conceivable spot. Nothing.\n\nAs a side note, the only reason this is *really* concerning to me is that I can't get into the trunk with the spare key and a bunch of our stuff is in there. I can't stop thinking \"what the hell happened in Yuma??\"\n\nThis morning, I was fishing through the snack bin we kept in the car during our trip for something to eat. I saw a black plastic bag and I had forgotten what we'd put in there. I opened it up and there were two bubble-wrapped ceramic cups we'd bought in Tucson and...... you guessed it, my keys.\n\nI lost the keys within seconds of parking at the Starbucks. I hadn't moved from the driver's seat. This bin I eventually found them in was in the backseat, underneath our cooler, and the plastic bag with the cups was inside the bin, tied up tightly. \n\nI should also note that my girlfriend definitely isn't the type to play pranks and she's just as baffled as I am.\n\nSo...... possible glitch?? What say you, Reddit?",

        "text": "So I've experienced several glitches over the past year that were small, like a hole in the sink that wasn't there, towel hung up again after I put it away, stories I haven't heard from my friends when they swore they've told me. But what happened a couple days ago freaked me out and I can't explain how it happened. \n\nMy boyfriend told me to pick him up from his brothers apartment after a concert I went to, and before I picked him up I went to get food and called him to see what he wanted to eat. He sounded really tired over the phone so I asked if he was sleeping and he said he was so I told him to stay up because I was on my way to pick him up. \n\n20 minutes later I turned left onto his brothers block and counted the number of apartments 1...2...3 and turned into the parking lot of the third one. I knew I was at the right one because it was the third apartment on the left. I texted my boyfriend that I was here and waited five minutes assuming he was getting dressed and ready to go. Another 10 minutes later and I was thinking maybe he fell asleep again so I called him twice and he wasn't answering. I decided to go upstairs to the apartment and wake him up in person if he wasn't answering my calls and I didn't want to wait anymore. \n\nThis is where it gets weird. The door to the apartment has a messed up lock so it can be opened without you being buzzed in. I go upstairs to the top floor and open the door to the left. This is crucial because I KNEW that was his apartment, no doubt about it. Third apartment on the street, top floor, on the left. I opened the door quietly and went inside to the living room where I assumed my bf was sleeping. \n\nHe wasn't there. There was piles of stacked clothes on the couches which looked completely different from his brothers, and the TV stand was different too. The whole apartment was also clean, which is unusual because they have two little kids and it's always messy inside. I didn't really look around for that long because I thought I wasn't in the right apartment even though I knew this was the exact location. \n\nI was dumbfounded and confused. Was I even in the right apartment? What if I walked into the wrong one? I didn't want the people living here seeing a stranger walk in the middle of the night looking around for her bf. So I left as quick as I can and gotin my car and called my bf again. \n\nHe answered and apologized and said he was coming down. At first I looked around and thought maybe I was in the wrong building, but I saw him come down the stairs. I asked him where he was sleeping and he said on the couch...with his sister and her bf because they sleep there too. He got in my car and I told him I went upstairs to wake him up bc he wasn't answering and I thought I walked in the wrong apartment because there were clothes on the couches and I didn't see him anywhere. But it was the top floor, to the left. He dismissed it as something else and told me I probably walked in the second floor or went to the top and went to the right. But I know where I went, no doubt. \n\nDid I stumble into a parallel universe? I have no explanation for this and it's freaking me out. ",

I try and help him find something obvious that he is missing. We try for about a week straight. He curses, he screams. I apparently had a vivid dream where he is playing it and gets past it, without my help. Keep in mind I have seen every nook and cranny of this level, but plain didn't figure it out. Well I wake to him screaming one morning, at the same part. I'm confused, ask didn't you get past this already? Dude, I know you have. You go here, you go here, do this. He follows my instructions, and bam. He beat it in less than 30 seconds due to me having literally seeing him beat it before. He looked at me like I was insane, but this dream saved me from getting a controller to the face. \nP.S. If this is the wrong subreddit, please point me to the right one.

        "text": "I remember a lot of things from my childhood, and most of my memories would have to be in my grandparents house. One that has always stuck with me was the one night my grandmother fell asleep without me being next to her. \n\n\nI was on the computer playing some basic education game for young young kids, and i’d just gotten done with one of the levels i was stuck on. I had decided to call it a day and started walking to the bedroom. Usually at this time my grandma would be reading her bible or something, but she must’ve been extra tired this night because she was sound asleep. This is where it all began.\n\n\nI remember it was around 10:30PM at night, which was pretty late for me at that time so i was ready for bed. I was in the hallway looking at my grandma, and noticed hat she had fallen asleep with the lamp on. I was about to wake her up and tell her she forgot, when i kinda decided to just... keep quiet and watch? \n\n\nI looked at the blinds on the window, and noticed the shadows of the trees outside moving at a quick pace. I watched shadow of the whole tree itself rotate across in a smooth fashion, as the shadows of the leaves danced along. The lighting outside began to dim at a noticeable rate, and then brighten as the sun flew past the top corner of the window. After the sun had finished rising, i could hear the birds chirping. The lamp was no longer on, and i do not remember it ever turning off at the same time. I never moved a muscle during this time so i saw everything. My grandma never moved either, and then after all this happened i remember shrugging it off like it was no big deal, hopping into the bed, and not being tired anymore.\n\n\nThe thing about this *timelapse* event was that, although it doesn’t make sense, I was not standing in that spot for 10 hours. I was only standing there for like 10 seconds. It felt like i was temporarily removed from the timeline, and just fast forwarded to the next day. I know for a fact i didn’t stand in that spot for hours on end. I also know it wasn’t a dream because i remember the next few hours of that day.\n\n\n**NEXT FEW HOURS**\n\n\nI was lying bed trying to sleep but i genuinely wasn’t tired anymore. I was probably lying there for about an hour, until i decided that i didn’t need sleep that day, and went downstairs into the kitchen. No one else was awake yet so it must’ve been a weekend, and somewhat early (for a weekend) because they would have work in the mornings and i’d go to daycare. \n\n\nI remember walking into the kitchen and seeing a HUGE spider. Not the size of a tarantula, but maybe the size of a half dollar. It was beige and didn’t have any hair on it at all. I thought it was super ugly, and i watched it crawl across the kitchen floor and under the oven. I remember standing there for a good while waiting for it to come out from under the oven so i could see it again, but it never did.  \n\n\nI ended up running upstairs, into my mom’s room, and trying to wake her up. I kept telling her about the spider while she was sleeping, but she obviously did not care. Anyways, i was persistent, and eventually she came downstairs with me, didn’t see anything, and went back to bed. ",

        "text": "Hello again glitch in the matrix,\nI made a post a few months ago, asking fellow redditors and glitch in the matrix believers to start compiling information from glitch in the matrix posts, The purpose of this was to try to find out how to initiate a glitch in the matrix, or at least what causes them.\n\nI had an experience just a few hours ago. While I didn’t find anything major, I found a couple helpful starting points that could maybe help us uncover what is going on. \n\nThe experience started on my way back from a hockey game. I was driving on I-95 and my girlfriend and I left Boston at exactly 10:41. I know this for a fact because my girlfriend texted her friend to say bye and to told her to drive safe. We departed exactly after this text was sent. \nTo set up for the glitch, it is important to note that I live 55 minutes away from Boston with no traffic. There are two major interstates leading away from Boston. Both go the same direction but one is a bit more direct than the other.\n\nAs we departed, google maps informed me of an accident on one of the major highways that leads away from Boston (most direct route). We decided to take the other major highway, which would add 15 minutes to the trip, but it was better than sitting in standstill traffic.\n\nOnce we got on this highway, and drove for about 10 miles, and we reached another junction to the most direct major highway, passed where the accident occurred. I decided to get back on, and continue since it was more direct. This is where things got weird.\n\nWe see a sign for our destination town, which read 55 miles. Keep in mind we were already 15 minutes out of the 1 hour and 20 minutes of the total trip (20 minutes longer because of taking the less direct interstate for a bit).\n\nAt this point, my girlfriend decides to text her friend to see how their trip is going. The text was sent at exactly 10:58pm. (Roughly 2 minutes after we got back on the more direct interstate). As soon as this text was sent, I took my eyes off the road for 1 second to grab a water bottle that I had dropped on the floor, and my girlfriend was looking out of the windshield. She interrupted me sounding very confused. \n\n2 minutes had passed since we had seen the sign that said we were 55 miles away from our destination. My girlfriend pointed to a road sign that read we were only 35 miles from our destination. Instantly thinking that this could be a possible glitch in the matrix, I had my girlfriend record the outside weather temperature. It was 23 degrees exactly (according to the iPhone weather app). I also recorded my speed. I was using cruise control the whole trip, and had my cruise set to 74 mph (just barely speeding in a 65 mph zone). Maybe either of these things could have an effect on causing a glitch.\n\nSo now the proof of a time lapse: my girlfriend’s friend, and her boyfriend, left 20 mins before we did. We arrived just 5 minutes after them, and arrived at our place 20 mins before we should have, and 35 minutes before we should have, considering we had taken the detour  (We all live in the same apartment complex so they were still in the parking lot when we pulled in).\n\nI know for a fact that this could not have possibly been a mistake reading the  road signs, because a) my girlfriend and I both saw the signs for 55 miles and 35 miles. And b) we arrived at our destination 35 minutes before we should have. My girlfriend’s friend, and her boyfriend asked me how fast I was driving, in order to catch up to them. It is pretty easy to see however, that driving just 9 above the speed limit can’t take 35 minutes off the trip. \n\nAlthough it’s not much data, I think it could be a good starting point to help uncover this mystery. Even if it means nothing, it was still an interesting and cool glitch in the matrix. Another thing that is important to mention, that could be a possible link, is that today was the winter solstice. Maybe the movement of celestial bodies and the gravity from these movements, can temporarily disrupt time, since time is a dimension (just a possible thought, however I’m now astronomer)\n\n\n\nOther note 1: my girlfriend’s friend, and her boyfriend took the same route as us\n\nOther note 2: we made it home from Boston in 45 minutes which should have taken 55. So we gained 10 minutes off the total trip, and gained 20 minutes off of the detour, which should have added 20 minutes. So what should have taken 1 hour and 20 mins, ended up taking us 35 mins less, and the 10 minutes gained off the total trip helped us catch up to our friends. \n\nLet me know what you guys think. I’m just gonna ignore stupid/rude comments, but welcome any constructive debate! \n\n",

        "text": "For the past four months things for me have felt distorted. Everyday weird coincidences would occur, and even if some of them were small it was almost like they messed me up even more mentally. \n\nI'd just like to say before I really get into it that both my friend and i are in our early teens. We both have never done drugs nor have we ever drunken alcohol. \n\nSo I kept going on like this, being shocked by all these coincidences but never speaking out about them. They got terrible though when my friend (I'll call her Zoe) started to shut me out. It happened super suddenly and I was afraid that maybe it was because of a toxic relationship with her boyfriend. \n\nFinally, after weeks of trying I'm able to contact her and she apologizes saying that after something really difficult she began to dissociate. We went on taking for a really long time and she told me all this things about her soul I guess you would say. \n\nOne big thing that she kept bringing up was that she could feel others people's emotions very clearly. They didn't even have to be showing them she just knew and it caused a ton of break downs for her. \n\nI sort of moved us away from that subject, not only because I didn't understand it but it made everything feel even more distorted for me. So we keep talking about what had been going on with each other the past weeks before she talks about what else had happened. \n\nDuring the time we hadn't been talking Zoe had an out of body experience. She kept it very vague this first time saying that she blacked out mid day in her house and when she woke up again she was in the middle of a giant field about a mile from her house. \n\nFeeling super uncomfortable at this point I decide to lie and tell her I have to do chores. Things go on normally after this. I don't have any more weird coincidences popping up at least until the beginning of November. \n\nThe night before I had a waking dream in which I was paralyzed on my bed, able to make out my whole room, but there was a crowd of black eyed  people around me and watching me. I couldn't move, talk, or even hear them. I knew they were talking though. \n\nWhen I woke up I began writing in my journal about all this multi dimensional stuff. Basically how we live in one universe that are surrounded by trillions or maybe even infinitely  more. And basically this hoard of multiverses all exist inside of this giant thing that is a copy of another that was corrupted. And basically that instead of parallel universes they are bubbles that can intermerge with other bubbles that create a temporary portal. \n\nFinally I work up the courage after this experience to call Zoe and tell her how I've been feeling like reality has been distorted. I read her my notes and we both immediately feel this pressure. Slowly she begins telling me all these crazy details not only about how her emotions are tied with others, but how she feels like she's tied to this greater being. \n\nShe ranted about how she would feel people in desperate need for her help who weren't even there. Even on the phone she felt human warmth and this need and it was so intense that she began bawling after 10 minutes of absolute silence on our line. \n\nWe kept talking about all of this crazy multiverse stuff and Zoe told me that when she went to the field during her out of body experience she sat in this absolutely perfect circle and just stayed there. She kept telling me how she felt connected to something greater but had to leave because she was scared of what would happen if she stayed. \n\nRight after telling me about this she said that since then she had felt like \"she started something that needed to be finished.\"\n\nWe haven't talked about it since, but I still have these crazy dreams and every single one I'm either acting as a guardian so that someone can get to something or I know I will die and I have this building sense of dread throughout the dream. \n\nAnd i don't know if I'm purposely doing this to myself and making myself feel paranoid, or if it's real, or if I'm flat out going crazy but I've never been so scared in my life. I just feel this need to go back to the circle with her and see if any of this is actually real. \n\nIf any of you have any advice or can just flat out tell me to get out of my head please say something.

        "text": "This is one of my oldest memories and I have no clue as to the context. I was probably around 5 years old. \n\nI was with my mom and we were visiting an older woman. Possibly my great aunt. I’m not really sure. \n\nI think she was in an apartment. Everything was very brown, styled with old wood like they did in the 70s. Paneling and dark wood cupboards. \n\nI was in her kitchen, just poking around, being a nosy and curious little girl. I remember walking up to what would seem to be a closet or pantry door, and opened it.\n\nIt flung open and on the other side was another kitchen, extremely similar to the one I was in, almost like a mirror image, only in this one was an old man, naked except for a pair of boxers, his big hairy gut jutting forward, standing at his stove cooking breakfast.\n\nAs I stood there, completely and utterly stunned, he turned his head and looked at me.\n\nI slammed the door shut and ran away. I found my mom but didn’t tell her. For a long time my child’s mind just assumed my great aunt had a door that connected her apartment to someone else’s, and that I wasn’t supposed to open it. I felt embarrassed, like I’d get in trouble if I told anyone. I mean, I had accidentally seen a dude in his underwear! \n\nSo I never told anyone and just forgot about it, until I got older and started to question it.\n\nTwenty-four years later and I’ve never again seen an apartment that connects to another like that.",
