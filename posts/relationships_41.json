I said I don’t have to if it’s too much for you, but also it’s not like I’d be napping all day. He argued that “it’s always all day”. I haven’t had a nap in months. \n\n\nI’m the “default parent” so my husband always naps whenever he wants, however long he wants and I never say anything about it. He’s a recovering alcoholic so I understand why he’s tired a lot but it always leaves me doing everything else around the house. He still helps out as much as he can, it’s not like he’s doing nothing.\n\n\nI feel like it’s not fair whenever I ask for a nap it turns into an argument. Like I’m not asking to sleep all day everyday. I’m sick too and just want to rest for a little bit. How do I address this without making into an argument?\n\n\nTLDR: I asked if it’d be okay I go for a nap and my husband got annoyed with me",

        "text": "My (24F) boyfriend (29M) have been dating for 6 months. In this time, we haven’t had sex due to what I believe is ED and/or anxiety.\n\nI don’t think he has a high sex drive to begin with because whenever I initiate/send pics/talk dirty, he replies in polite but neutral ways (i.e. “that looks great on you” in response to a lingerie nude). His erections aren’t strong enough for sex and usually don’t last, especially if I try to help. When he’s half way up and I suggest trying to have sex, he loses it. This has lead to him trying to do it soft, which makes me feel unattractive and turned off (idk if this is valid for me to feel since it isn’t his fault). This resorts to me giving him soft, usually unsuccessful HJ’s and calling it a day. He says he’s satisfied by this.\n\nI have a high-sex drive, so I’ve talk to him about this before to try to reach a solution but he just says it’ll get better with time. I’ve suggested toys and the answer was no. I’ve tried to bring up my kinks, but he shuts down the conversation. Because of this, I’m extremely nervous to ask him to talk to his doctor about ED treatment. \n\nI’m nervous to even tell him it’s ED. I’m nervous he’ll brush off any potential solution I raise because he doesn’t see a problem.\n\nHas anyone had to raise this with their partner before? How do I express that I am deeply unhappy with our sex life without hurting his ego and making it worse?\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend can’t have sex with me. Seems to have ED or anxiety, but unwilling to fix it on his own. I’ve tried bringing up solutions but he shuts down conversations. How do I tell him this is a problem without hurting his ego ?",

        "text": "My SO and I have been together for about 10 years. Our relationship was a bit rocky in the beginning but the last 5 years in particular have been amazing. I did trust him implicitly. We have big long term plans, consider eachother life partners. Great communication typically- solve any issues expertly and it always brings us closer in the end. All that. \n\nThe only big issue we've encountered is that I really want to get married and he's never thought of himself as the marrying type. He says he's working through it, and I've mostly accepted that answer. I told him it felt like he just didn't want to commit to me but he said that all of our financial ties (owning a car and house together) are his ways of being deeply committed. I don't want to end our otherwise amazing relationship because of that, but I do still hope that we'll eventually get married. Even just a commitment ceremony- I don't care about the paperwork.\n\nBut then about a month ago we were talking about driving etiquette and I replied to his statement with \"oh so you just expect everyone else to follow that whisper but not you?\" And he laughed and said \"of course- rules don't apply to me\". And we've joked about that in the past- it's always been very tongue in cheek. But for some reason I kept thinking about it. Then I felt like I was such by a lightening bolt and so many things rushed into my mind. How before we were \"official\" but had agreed not to sleep with other people I caught him on tinder. How he never posts pictures of us together on social media, doesn't have relationship status displayed, and has never even mentioned me in a post. And the conversation we had a few years back about how he sometimes missed the thrill of meeting someone and having a one night stands, and then it's taking about how we might consider openings out relationship up to one night stands while we're on vacation together. And I can't shake this feeling that he's been unfaithful and used they conversation as a way to justify it. Or just thinking that what I don't know won't hurt me. \n\nAt the beginning of our relationship he had severe trust issues but we worked through those and he's said he really does trust me. But I've never given him any reason not to and I've been patient and compassionate about his trust issues due to exes cheating. \n\nI have considered talking to him about it, and I probably will, but what's stopping me right now is that 1. I have no real reason to suspect anything. I have the passwords to all of his devices, he freely gives me his phone to order food, call my own phone when I can't find it, Google something or use it as a flashlight if my phone is out of reach. I have access to his desktop computer and I work from home while he works at his office most days. And 2. I've been wrestling with insecurities over him being hesitant about marriage and I am trying to decide if that's the real cause of my fears around this. \n\nI assume everyone is just going to say to talk to him about it. And I know I should, and probably will. But I don't want to talk about this with friends or family, and that's usually how I process things. So Reddit, what do you think? Is the situation sus or am I probably just having insecurities crop up?\n\nTL;DR - SO made a comment about rules are got everyone else and not him, and now some issues from the past (tindering early in our relationship) coupled with his reminiscing about the chase and work trips are causing me anxiety about possible cheating.",

I must admit I did have an attitude, as girls usually do. Sometimes hard headed. But what didn’t sit right with me, I wanted him to realize it and do something about it. Do not get me wrong, we shared a lot of good moments together, try new things, travel, explore. When it came to my feelings, it was just a whole other story. Point is, he ended up breaking up with me. That last convo he was just going off on me. And this one time I didn’t tell him to relax or go after him, he didn’t bother to come to me. \n\nHe didn’t reach out, until a little over a month. The first time it was on Instagram.

I expected him to do a bit more, but I didn’t want to tell him what to say/do. From there on he never said a thing. I was easy to let go of to say the least. Is it true that someone will do whatever it takes to be with someone? If he truly wanted me he wouldn’t have stopped…… right? \n\nI reached out after 3 months of no contact. And he started blaming me saying I didn’t want him, that he “tried.” And started telling me how good he was without me, that he could do what he want when he wanted. That he went to get multiple private lap dances, slept with a girl. Go to bars. Told me how good it was. He’s told everyone about what he’s been doing. Told me that he let go. He told everyone I reached out, and has been telling them how he feels no connection with me. Making me look dumb.. \n\nWhile for me, it didn’t cross my mind once to interact with another guy. I started taking the gym serious, trying to slowly heal. Traveled. I let my emotions take over, and I’ve constantly been telling him how could I be so easy to let go of, how could he do these things so fast. It just doesn’t sit right with me, and his response is he thought I didn’t want him, and he was single. \n\nIt’s been 3 weeks since we’ve been “talking.” More like me being insecure of what he did and throwing it at his face. But I can’t get the fact that he slept with another girl, and went to do all these other things. He then tells me, that if I want to be with him I have to let go of what he did when we didn’t talk. And said that I can not control him whatsoever. If he wants to go to bars with his friends he has every right and the moment I tell him he can’t go because I can’t he will lose it and not want to be with me. That he does these things for fun, not to look for other women. Regardless, I don’t think it’s right if I am not there. Shouldn’t he be giving me reassurance instead of setting all these rules? \n\nTLDR: Do I have a right to be upset that my ex boyfriend (23m) did these things so soon? Is this a sign for me to let go? Have any of you gotten back with an ex knowing they slept with someone else? Need advice!",

You can’t sit with us.” And my other coworker, who is her roommate as well, piles onto and laughs and says “yeah.” And the two of them start laughing. \n\nThis is on top of other comments she’s made before to me and I just sat down and didn’t say anything and didn’t look at her for the rest of the day. It made things so awkward and my other coworker at the table texted me and asked wtf is going on. \n\nIt’s made things kind of awkward now and I don’t know how to approach this situation. Do I just continue to ignore her comments at work or say something to her? I’m afraid if I do, she’ll run to her roommate and say I’m dramatic and reply immaturely and say it was just a joke.

Within these years, anytime he would get mad or thought I was trying to start a problem he would close off all doors on me.

Receive reassurance, be shown my true worth. A lot of these times, lead to me bursting into tears, crying to him and he would be unphased. Just sit there and not care. And call me problematic. I must admit I did have an attitude, as girls usually do. Sometimes hard headed. But what didn’t sit right with me, I wanted him to realize it and do something about it. Do not get me wrong, we shared a lot of good moments together, try new things, travel, explore. When it came to my feelings, it was just a whole other story.

        "text": "So let me just go back to about a year and a half ago when me and my ex both liked each other, therefore, we decided to date for about a month. Then she randomly dumped me because she wanted to be \"single\", however, literally 2 weeks later she gets with this other dude from my school but only dates him for about a week or two. As a couple of months go by she gets a crush on one of my mates and they both begin to date for about a year and a bit. Then a month ago he decided to dump her so we both began to talk to each other more than before as he wasn't in the way anymore. However, whilst they were dating me and her kept each other up to date on how our lives were going even though he was strongly against me communicating with her, she even began to seek advice from me about her relationship and even claimed sometimes that she was closer with me than she was with him. Now that they aren't together anymore she's become more open with me about her problems and we've basically become best friends as we are both in the same lesson and talk to each other inside and outside of school every day. This closeness that we had over the past couple of weeks led her to inviting me to her birthday party at which she spent 80% of the time with me and kept hugging and like sort of cuddling with me, then at one point she randomly goes \"I'm being too close with you aren't I?\" and then I was like \"yeahhhhh kinda but it's fine\" and she responded with like this kinda of annoyed \"ahhhh\". She then went in and went to get a drink then came back outside to sit with me and she continued the same way as before (bear in mind that I was completely sober and she had about 3 cans of cider and a shot of tequilla at this point). I forgot to mention that before inviting me to her party she told me that she wanted to get really drunk and tell someone what was on her mind but because she spent most of her time with me she ended up not drinking enough to be able to say what she wanted to say. Then a couple days after that we had a chemistry lesson in which I decided to question her about what was on her mind that she was so desperate to get off of her mind but she refused until she decided that she'll give me hints so that I can try and work it out. I ended up linking all the hints and managed to work out what it was that she'd had on her mind for the past couple days. It turned out that she was confused about \"us\" because she felt like she liked me but at the same time she also felt like she was not sure if she actually did which was the exact same thought which I had like a week after she broke up with her ex but I ended up putting that idea to rest as I spent a long time trying to stop liking her after we broke up but now I feel like I've gone back to that same old place. In which my heart is telling me that I like her but my brain is telling me that she's my ex and that the last thing I should be doing is getting back with her. (sorry about the part about the brain and the heart I know it sounds cringy but idk how else to phrase it). After I worked out what was on her mind she asked me what I think about it and whether she needs to find a solution to the problem I told her that it's probably better to just leave it as it is and not force anything and if we do end up dating then that's fine. However, the day after I said that the idea of me liking her but at the same time not being sure if I like her began to infest my brain as I began to overthink the whole idea and I started to search for solutions even though I told her that there was no need for a solution. So the last couple days she's been acting normally and isn't being stressed out about the whole situation on the other hand that's the only thing that's been on my mind. Today I decided to tell her that it's been bugging me, even though I was the one who said for us to just leave it, and she said that she doesn't know what to say and that she's going with the flow and seeing how it goes even though she's still confused about the whole situation. The main issue is that we both don't want to ruin this close friendship that we've built even though we both like each other. Have any of you got any tips on what I can do to ease this whole situation or just any general tips on how I can try to remove this all from my mind so that I can stop overthinking it?\n\nTldr: After my ex broke up with her most recent bf she has became close with me and we both discussed that we kind of like eachother and I don't know what to do any tips would be appreciated :)",

        "text": " Hello everyone! I don't know if it's the right sub to ask my question, but I really do woman's opinions!\n\nI'm from France so my english is not perfect, sorry!\n\nI'm a 26 YO guy, and the girl I speak about is 21YO.\n\nSO, I'm lost. I met a great girl 4 months ago and we saw each other a lot for 3months (I slept like 20 days at her house in 1 month). After the first few weeks, we already were in a relation (but she wasnt my gf yet - cause she left his 4years ex BF 3 months before meeting me, so she wasn't ready to be my GF yet).\n\nThose weeks/months were great, almost the greatest of my life. She said she loved me early in the relationship. I asked her if it wasnt too soon but she says she clearly does loves me and she regreted we didnt met before her EX (who was an asshole for some reason - she explained me everything and he really was).\n\nBUT she still had feelings for him (even if she is the one who dumped him cause he was bad for her).\n\nEverything was great, and 1months ago, she asked me to be her BF. I was soo happy, even tho I wasnt ready to say \"I love you\" yet, I was ready to be his BF for sure. (So at this point, she loves me, I really like her and I could almost say I love her too).\n\nBut 2 weeks ago, she went \"distant\" for a few days and I immediatly understood something bad was happening. We saw each other and she explained me she saw her ex BF randomly during a party and it hurt her a lot - even tho she doesnt want anything with him, she says she isnt over her past relation yet. So she broke up with me.\n\nAt this point, I felt really bad, but she did it well and respectfully. She also said one of her old (before knowing me) sex friend asked to see her and she said yes. (So she said \" you see, I'm bad for you, I even accepted \"him\" to come.).\n\nI said ok (with a lot of crying etc) and said \"If you change your mind, do it before seeing him\". I also said I was sorry but I will have to block her everywhere so I can forget her. ( even tho I can see her at school, which hurt me a lot). I had some clothes at her house and I told her to give it to a friend who would give it to me, so we wouldnt have to see each other. (all that was on saturday evening).\n\nMonday, I go see my friend, I see my now \"ex gf\" leaving the room and she was clearly sad. My friend give me my clothes and the gifts I gave her during our relationship. I told my friend he should give her the gift back and I will unblock her to explain I want her to keep the gifts.\n\nSo I did unblock her, we spoke about the gifts, she said she was happy I was letting her keeping it. I tried to end the conversation and she said \"To be honest, I dont want to end this conversation\" which I answered \"Same but I need 1 or 2 days to think abt myself\". My goal was to show I was still happy and confident, even tho it wasnt always true.\n\n2 days after (wendsday), I text her to meet her, I asked if she was ok, she said she wasnt. We spoke about some of her personnal problems, I said her it was \"idiot\" to not be in a relationship because of some other asshole that shouldnt even exist and I was ready to help her when she has doubt. She hold my hand and my legs. I was so happy and thought it was going to start again.\n\nOn the same evening (wednesday), I asked her how her day went and she immediatly called me and we spoke. I asked her what she think about was I said when we spoke and she said she understand me but wasnt ready to start a relationship again. She also said me his \"sex friend\" wasnt coming cause she cancelled it.\n\nThe day after (thursday), she spend the midday time with me and our friends. I tried to not speak to much to her cause I didnt want to have too much feelings in case it didnt work out anymore. But she showed me her phone with her sex friend conversation open to show me she wasnt meeting him. I asked her why she shows me the conversation and she said \"to show you I keep my words\". I said I trusted her anyway.\n\nThe day after, we where with her friends and I wasnt paying to much attention to her (cause I didnt know what she wanted) and she randomly said \"yesterday I shouldve kiss the guy I danced with\".). I didnt want to show it hurt me so I didnt say anything, but 10 min after she put her hand on my leg and showed me affection again.\n\nI didnt speak to her during the week-end but asked to see her on monday. I asked her why she spoke about wanting to kiss a guy, was it to make me react or was it cause she really wanted to kiss him ?\n\nShe first appologized cause it was rude of her and then said \"both, I wanned you to react but you didnt\". I said \" those thing make me think twice cause it hurt me\". And she said \"yeah I'm sorry I'm bad for you, you should forget me\". I said we could start over and she said she couldnt be a loyal GF now cause her ex GF didnt let her space so now she want to see many boys etc. She also said that I didnt give her enough attention when she wasnt physically with me. I told her I knew her ex didnt let her any freedom so I tried to let her do her things when she wasnt with me but that I did it thinking it was the best for her, cause usually I would text her way more. We didnt have time to finish the conversation so I asked to speak after her class and she said yes.\n\nSO until this, I was the confident/happy guy, but since she said I didnt gave her enough attention, and since she said I had to forget her, I told myself \"it's my last chance, I will say everything I trully feel now\". So I saw her and say EVERYTHING (I miss her, I thought about her the whole week, I wasnt ready to let her go etc). (She also said she was hesitant last week and that's why she sometimes was trying to make me react).\n\nSo I offered her a relation : She can see whoever she want (kissing boys etc) but she has to say it to me and I would see if I can handle it or if it's too much for me. She said no, I insisted ( like 4 or 5 times) and she finally said yes, but she said she felt forced. We still kissed. (She also said she was hesitant last week and that's why she sometimes was trying to make me react).\n\nThe day after ( Tuesday ) I send her a message saying I was sorry that I insisted that much and that I wanned her to decide and I would accept if she says no. She said \" Idk what to answer to that\". and I said \"ok, we will try till you decide then\".\n\nNow, we send eachother snapchat, but she only send me the same as the one she send to everyone (for the streaks). When we speak, she is rude (like only answering \"no\" without smiley), while she wasnt rude at all before. Even the week after the breakup, when we spoke about the gift etc, she wasnt rude.\n\nI asked if I could come to her home, she said she didnt feel good that night. I said if another day was ok for her, she just has to tell me. She only answered \"ok\".\n\nnow, since this, I saw her once (at school) and she obviously wasnt enjoying my presence that much.\n\nI think that showing all my emotion and my feelings to her on monday broke the attraction she felt for me. Cause before that, she said she still loved me but she couldnt continue the relation. But now, I dont feel like she even loves me anymore. She only once texted me \" how did your discussion with the teacher go?\". I was happy she took some news, but that's the only time she messaged me first.\n\nI really want to try this \"new\" type of relationship, I dont wanna let her go. But if showing my emotion made her loose feelings, what can I do ? Because she told me I didnt gave her enough attention before, so I want to give her everything I can now, but I dont want to be the first to message every time, and get some rude no or yes answers.\n\nI know I should moove on, but I really dont want to. If there is a change we can try something, I'm ready for it. She is a great women and I still have feelings for her.\n\nShould I leave a few days without too much contact to let her time to miss me ? And if she doesnt miss me, moove on cause it's obviously not working anymore ?\n\nShould I text her \"I see it's not working for both of us, I'm mooving on, thanks for everything\" ? (It would break me)\n\nShould I ask to come to her home again?(but I already said 3 days ago \"if I can come another day, tell me\" so she wouldve ask herself if she wanted.. I think insisting may be the worst choice)\n\nCan showing your emotion really make her loose interest ? If yes, is there a way to switch things up ? Should I not contact her (unless streaks snap) for a few days ?\n\nThanks for reading!! I know a lot of you will think \" bro you should moove on\" but the fact she gave me hope last week make it so much harder than it was before. That's the last thing I want to do, but if I see nothing works next week, I will have to, I know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR : I met a great woman, she dumped me cause she couldnt stop thinking about her ex. I want her back but I think I did I mistake by showing her all my emotions.",

        "text": " \n\nMy girlfriend and I got together in August. She has overall been a huge net positive in my life, and I wish I could stay with her, because we are very compatible hobby, personality, and humor wise. However, she is asexual, and I am not. I knew this going into the relationship, because she explicitly told me.\n\nThis is my first relationship, so I  tried making it work, however, not being able to have sex with her is wearing on me. I discussed this with her, and she actually suggested that we find other people for me to have sex with, while still being in a relationship with her. After a lot of consideration, I decided against this, as it doesn't feel like something that I would be comfortable with. (Nothing against people in open relationships, I just feel that I can't do it.)\n\nWe've become very attached to one another, and I feel that I need to break it off now because if this goes on, we're only going to hurt each other more. I know that this is my fault. I am an idiot for letting this continue, knowing that it likely wouldn't work out in the end due to a fundamental incompatibility between us. The least I can do is let her go in a way that hurts her as little as possible. I have never been in a relationship before, so I have no idea how to end one on good terms. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nTLDR; my gf is asexual and I am not. I know that I need to break off the relationship because I am afraid that going on with this fundamental compatibility is a bad idea. How do I do it in a way that causes the least harm to her?",

        "text": "I’m halfway through my semester abroad, and I’ve made a new friend who I really like. We’re in a study abroad group of ~15 students all from the same home Uni, so I vaguely knew of her before, but became friends through the program. We have a lot of interests in common and get along very well personality-wise, so we’ve naturally ended up hanging out a lot together this semester. I’ve really enjoyed her company as a friend, but recently started developing feelings for her. Now I’m wondering if I should tell her I like her as more than a friend or just leave it be. We’re both bi, fyi.\n\nA part of me wants to tell her because I want to be transparent about my feelings and don’t want to be stuck pining when I can just find out how she feels. I do think there’s a chance she reciprocates, since we’ve had touchy moments, but those lines are very blurred with friends. Another part of me does not want to tell her because we’re in this group for two more months and if things get awkward there is literally no way to escape each other’s company. I’d also hate to lose her as a friend, it would kind of suck since she’s the one I talk to the most in our school group. (I’d be down to be friends even if I was rejected, but I realize it may be different for her). I’m also wary of the fact that I may be catching feelings from being with a small group all the time. It’s very confusing. Should I just wait until we’re back on campus next year and can safely ignore each other if things get weird? That’s kind of a long time.\n\nTLDR: made new friend from study abroad semester, debating whether to tell her about my burgeoning crush.",

        "text": "My boyfriend (23m) and I have been together a little over 5 years. Within these years, anytime he would get mad or thought I was trying to start a problem he would close off all doors on me. Break up with me because he couldn’t take the long talks, conversations, etc. Thought I wanted to always start an argument/drama. When in reality, I just wanted to feel like a priority. Receive reassurance, be shown my true worth. A lot of these times, lead to me bursting into tears, crying to him and he would be unphased. Just sit there and not care. And call me problematic. I must admit I did have an attitude, as girls usually do. Sometimes hard headed. But what didn’t sit right with me, I wanted him to realize it and do something about it. Do not get me wrong, we shared a lot of good moments together, try new things, travel, explore. When it came to my feelings, it was just a whole other story. Point is, he ended up breaking up with me. That last convo he was just going off on me. And this one time I didn’t tell him to relax or go after him, he didn’t bother to come to me. \n\nHe didn’t reach out, until a little over a month. The first time it was on Instagram. I didn’t answer. A little over a week he showed up to my house. I didn’t go outside because I felt so empty and worthless. I expected him to do a bit more, but I didn’t want to tell him what to say/do. From there on he never said a thing. I was easy to let go of to say the least. Is it true that someone will do whatever it takes to be with someone? If he truly wanted me he wouldn’t have stopped…… right? \n\nI reached out after 3 months of no contact. And he started blaming me saying I didn’t want him, that he “tried.” And started telling me how good he was without me, that he could do what he want when he wanted. That he went to get private lap dances at strip clubs, slept with a girl, bars/clubs. Told me how good it was. He’s about going to strip club to everyone. Told me that he let go. He told everyone I reached out, and has been telling them how he feels no connection with me. Making me look stupid in a way.. While for me, it didn’t cross my mind once to interact with another guy. I started taking the gym serious, trying to slowly heal. Traveled. I let my emotions take over, and I’ve constantly been telling him how could I be so easy to let go of, how could he do these things so fast. It just doesn’t sit right with me, and his response is he thought I didn’t want him, and he was single. It’s been 3 weeks since we’ve been “talking.” More like me being insecure of what he did and throwing it at his face. But I can’t get the fact that he he slept with another girl, and went to strip clubs so soon. He then tells me, that if I want to be with him I have to let what he did when we didn’t talk. And said that I can not control him whatsoever. If he wants to go to bars with his friends he has every right and the moment I tell him he can’t go because I can’t etc. that he will lose it and not want to be with me. Shouldn’t he be giving me reassurance instead of setting all these rules? Reddit removed post, so I added it back. \n\nTLDR: Do I have a right to be upset that my ex boyfriend (23m) did these things so soon? Is this a sign for me to let go? Have any of you gotten back with an ex knowing they slept with someone else? Need advice!",

But I don't know if I deserve this treatment even though I fucked up majorly. \n\nMy husband is an immigrant. I was supposed to file his paperwork. I didn't. I told him that I did. He found out that I didn't. I fucked him over big time. He has every right to lose all trust and faith in me and be as angry as he wants. He has every right to leave. Im sure most people would. I have horrible cptsd that comes out in lying to please others and it has gotten to a really negative place where I don't feel I can control myself. I told him it was filed because I wanted to avoid the conflict and because it would make him happy. It was short sided and stupid and I'll never forgive myself for it. I have therapy set up to begin soon. \n\nMy husband has decided to stay with me. But he is still so angry. He is scaring me. It has been 2 months since he's found out and every morning he screams at me in the car. He tells me that he hates me, I'm an asshole, I'm a terrible person, I'm an evil wh***. He does this in front of our daughter. I'm terrified of him but I feel I deserve it because I fucked him over so bad. \n\nI guess my question is is this normal? Can this be repaired?

I know I might be naive but maybe he'll want something more serious with me ? In the meantime l'm scared that once I turned 18 he'll gets his revenge bc I kinda \"blackmailed\" him. I said that I was going to tell everything that happened to his daughter 24F... I do regret saying this but it was be I was angry he was having a gf and lied to me and basically played with me. I still have strong feel feelings for him be he was like my \"first everything\" It felt good being desired.\nWhat would recommend or do?\n\nTL;DR 17F 64M flirt, then “cheat” then nothing.\n\nBe kind I'm still 17 :)",

It’s like sometimes she acts like she likes me even tho I know she doesn’t.

        "text": "My boyfriend (23m) and I have been together a little over 5 years. Within these years, anytime he would get mad or thought I was trying to start a problem he would close off all doors on me. Break up with me because he couldn’t take the long talks, conversations, etc. Thought I wanted to always start an argument/drama. When in reality, I just wanted to feel like a priority. Receive reassurance, be shown my true worth. A lot of these times, lead to me bursting into tears, crying to him and he would be unphased. Just sit there and not care. And call me problematic. Do not get me wrong, we shared a lot of good moments together, try new things, travel, explore. When it came to my feelings, it was just a whole other story. Point is, he ended up breaking up with me. That last convo he was just going off on me. And this one time I didn’t tell him to relax or go after him, he didn’t bother to come to me. \n\nHe didn’t reach out, until a little over a month. The first time it was on Instagram. I didn’t answer. A little over a week he showed up to my house. I didn’t go outside because I felt so empty and worthless. I expected him to do a bit more, but I didn’t want to tell him what to say/do. From there on he never said a thing. I would tell him I deserved better, when in reality I wanted him to say he was going to change. I didn’t receive that. I was easy to let go of to say the least. Is it true that someone will do whatever it takes to be with someone? If he truly wanted me he wouldn’t have stopped…… right? \n\nI reached out after 3 months of no contact. And he started blaming me saying I didn’t want him, that he “tried.” And started telling me how good he was without me, that he could do what he want when he wanted. That he went to get private lap dances at strip clubs, slept with a girl, bars/clubs. Told me how good it was. That he let go. He told everyone I reached out, and has been telling them how he feels no connection with me. Making me look stupid. While for me, it didn’t cross my mind once to interact with another guy. I started taking the gym serious, trying to slowly heal. Traveled. I let my emotions take over, and constantly telling him how could I be so easy to let go of, how could he do these things so fast. It just doesn’t sit right with me, and his response is he thought I didn’t want him, and he was single. It’s been 3 weeks since we’ve been “talking.” More like me being insecure of what he did and throwing it at his face. But I can’t get the fact that he had sex with another girl, and went to strip clubs so soon. \n\n\nTLDR: Do I have a right to be upset that my ex boyfriend (23m) did these things so soon? Is this a sign for me to let go? Have any of you gotten back with an ex knowing they slept with someone else? Need advice!",

        "text": "This has a bit of backstory, which I'm going to keep short. Me and my girlfriend of 3 years live together, and everything is great, though about six months ago I walked in on her texting with someone very mysteriously. She didn't realize I was standing behind her, but there were kissy emojis and a joke about him flying out to \"meet up\". I only caught a glimpse and was so taken aback that I just slinked in to the other room without saying anything.\n\nEventually I worked up the nerve to ask my gf about what I saw, and she told me the whole story. Basically that this guy lives in her home state and is a friend of a friend that she went on two dates with before we met, and that  she \"gave him a BJ in a car one time and never saw him again\". Since then he's been periodically sliding in to her DMs and flirting, despite her telling him about me. I asked if I could see their DM history and this all checked out. They would chat about work a bit, and every now and then he would make some kind of sexual comment or suggest \"spending time together\". She would usually \"heart\" the message then change the subject. Any time she was in town she would act too busy to ever actually meet for \"a coffee catch up\", or say something like \"my boyfriend is here and I doubt you'd want to hang out with him\". My girlfriend is \\*extremely\\* conflict averse, so this all feels on brand for how she would handle something like this. \n\nAnyways, having that swim around in my head caused me to break one of my cardinal rules. I snooped through her phone last night. I went straight to her DM chain with him, and saw that he had messaged her to talk shop about the industry they're both in. It was harmless banter, but then he said \"by the way I was definitely drunk texting you last night 🙃\". She didn't respond to that comment and kept the focus on work. I then looked through her text messages and saw she had erased the entire thread with him. It was just there a month ago when she showed me her phone.\n\nFlash forward to this morning and I ask if she's heard from him since our conversation, and she says \"yeah he DM'd me this week to chat about work stuff\". I asked if he said anything inappropriate, and she just responded with nope! no sexual comments. This is clearly a lie, because whatever he \"drunk texted\" her the night before was incriminating enough for her to wipe the whole thread. Not really sure how to make heads or tails of this, but any input at all would be appreciated. Kind of hard to broach this further without admitting I looked through her phone, so maybe I should just drop it.\n\nTL;DR: Found my girlfriend entertaining DM's from a guy, then partially lied about this happening.",

        "text": "So over a month ago now I had the unfortunate displeasure of discovering a bed bug in my bed. My boyfriend and I don't live together and we only see each other about once a week on the same day every week but spend the entire day together typically at my house. I was terrified and embarrassed but I told him what I discovered. I could have gotten it a few places, I stayed with my parents over the holidays and in the summer of last year my brother brought home bed bugs to their house. By Christmas time it was all taken care of so we didn't think much of it but I stayed in the room with the chair that originally was in my brother's room. I also have to travel semi frequently due to doctors appointments and stay in decently cheap hotels so that could also have done it. After confessing my new unfortunate problem to him he told me that we won't see each other until I have 100% without a doubt have gotten rid of them. Half of me understood and half of me was extremely hurt that he wouldn't even remotely consider seeing me in public spaces and allowing me to do preventive measures so I wouldn't transfer them to him. I obviously would never ever want to give them to him but it was super hurtful nonetheless. At the moment I'm unemployed and on disability for my chronic illness and obviously have little money because of that. Even so I jumped through hoops to contact an exterminator and finally got one to come to my house for an inspection that costed $300. They did indeed confirm that I have bed bugs but they said the good news is it's a very minor infestation and he was proud of all the work I had done thus far in my own attempts to treat them. I was feeling so heartbroken and abandoned that I was super willing to dish out money to basically get my boyfriend back but when it was revealed how much it was going to cost I could not afford it. I was (and am still) devastated. It's now been over a month and I haven't seen my boyfriend whatsoever and he won't even talk to me on the phone or do any other work arounds for me, only will talk to me through texts. I've already have been going through so much turmoil with my chronic illness and I also have anxiety problems so all these stressors all at once have been making me sick and super emotional and just ridden with anxiety and hopelessness. Him and I have been fighting quite a bit because of this, I cannot for the life of me let my feelings go and I'm constantly asking him for reassurance and telling him how abandoned I feel and lashing out at him and I'm just seemingly unable to control my turbulent emotions for whatever reason. I guess I want to know more people's opinions on this and would like advice if anyone knows how to stop feeling abandoned and heartbroken over situations like this.\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend refuses to see me while I deal with bed bugs and I would like advice on how to stop feeling abandoned and heartbroken and also want to know if my feelings are valid.",

        "text": "I need help with what to do.\n\nLong story short I caught my ex of 2 years sexting another dude at 4 am whilst laying next to me in my bed...  \nA bit of backstory we've been together for just over 2 years now, No real issues, and the relationship was fine up until she went on a girl's holiday to turkey. When she came back she broke up with me for just over a month with no real reason as to why just she needed time alone which is odd as she's very clingy and attached to me usually. I asked the question as anyone would ''Did anything happen that I should know about'' She assured me it didn't. The truth to that ill never really know.  \nWe've been on and off for the last 6 months, mainly her just wanting time alone etc.\n\nSo I hadn't seen her for about 3 weeks (The longest we've been apart) we were talking every day throughout not seeing each other. Then she spent the weekend with me (Friday - Sunday). Friday night I saw another lad's name on her phone(Let's call him barry). Questioned her as to who it was and she told me it was a friend from uni but the way she acted when I asked seemed suspicious to me. I took her word for it anyway. Fast forward to Sunday morning and she was getting ready for work, she left her phone unlocked so I acted on my suspicions and checked it...  \nWish I hadn't because now I'm here very confused not knowing what to really do.  \nFound a dating app on her phone which is how she met Barry, there was a lot of sexual talk between them from the get-go which surprised me as she's very reserved and quiet in that manner.  \nIt then went to Snapchat where I found even more sexual chats and photos she was sending etc  \nTalking of things she never even mentioned to me before let alone wanted me to do...  \nSide Note: Our sex life etc has always been very good so there are no issues there as far as I'm aware.\n\nI was shocked by what I was reading and became quite upset and angry she had done something like this, let alone laying in my bed next to me...  \nI took her to work and didn't speak a word to her on the way for fear of saying something I shouldn't due to how I was feeling. We then didn't speak at all for the next few days until I messaged her wanting to know the truth. I told her how I found out etc which she wasn't happy about but she did understand. If the shoe was on the other foot and all that.  \nShe pretty much apologized about it, said she knew it was wrong and it was a ''Spur of the moment thing'' And then proceeded to say she just wants us to be over so she can not have to worry about things etc...  \nThis hurt a lot to hear and I wanted more answers as to what made her seek someone else's attention etc. We argued for a while and I ended up saying a few choice words about how I felt and what I thought of her for doing what she'd done etc.\n\nShe made out as if she wasn't massively bothered about what she had done and made me feel very small in the sense of everything was my fault...  \nObviously, I love this girl with everything I have and I've done nothing but provide and take care of her in the short time we've been together. (I'm the sort of person that dates to marry and I've treated her like a wife more than anything)\n\nNot really sure whether this is where I should just let things be and go our separate ways or keep trying? \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My ex was sexting another guy whilst laying in my bed next to me.

She hasn't dated many people so  the ex's she cares about were only 2, her first girlfriend (23F) and the last  one she dated(40sF). I have dated quite a few people, but there are 3 ex's in  my life that meant a lot to me in different ways. the first girl I  dated on and off for a few years when I first started college, my  relationship that lasted 6 years and a best friend I dated briefly  shortly after my long relationship ended (my mistake lol).\n\nI  had mentioned to her that I wanted to rekindle my relationship with the  ex that was my best friend for 8 years because I never really intended  to date her, it just happened out of my sadness and it was a mistake. I  also mentioned I wanted to try to fix my friendship with another friend  that I also messed around with (never slept together though) because she  was a really good friend, and I really appreciate her.

I've heard so many stories  about this girl and their relationship. They were each others first  times and I've heard about that story too. Now like I tell stories about  my past relationships too, and I imagine she has also felt the same way  I'm feeling right now about some things I've said, but it drives me  crazy. I know this is me being insecure and I don't want to feel this  way but I can't help it.\n\nI know I  can trust her, and I do, but I still feel so incredibly insecure and  helpless. I don't want to tell her about it because I don't want her to  think I don't trust her or that I'm just controlling but I need to find a  way to make peace with this before it drives me crazy. We're very open and she did tell me to please tell her if anything is wrong or if anything makes me uncomfortable but I don't want to control her. I know this stems from my previous relationship because my ex also began speaking with her first girlfriend and eventually cheated on me multiple times with her, it started innocently and it just kept getting worse, but my current girlfriend is nothing like my ex, and I guess that's what makes me feel so irrational about this.\n\nShould I bring how I feel up? Is this something I just gotta work on or should we just not handle things this way? How do I not come off so controlling if I bring this up?\n\nRant out -\n\nTLDR; I'm insecure about my relationship because my girlfriend wants to be friends with her ex again and I was the one that suggested wanting to do this in the first place",

        "text": "Sorry long relationship dump but I just need to write what I'm thinking and how I feel to rationalize it.\n\nA  few months ago my girlfriend (24F) and I (25F) discussed our ex's and how our  relationships with them stand as of now. She hasn't dated many people so  the ex's she cares about were only 2, her first girlfriend (23F) and the last  one she dated(40sF). I have dated quite a few people, but there are 3 ex's in  my life that meant a lot to me in different ways. the first girl I  dated on and off for a few years when I first started college, my  relationship that lasted 6 years and a best friend I dated briefly  shortly after my long relationship ended (my mistake lol).\n\nI  had mentioned to her that I wanted to rekindle my relationship with the  ex that was my best friend for 8 years because I never really intended  to date her, it just happened out of my sadness and it was a mistake. I  also mentioned I wanted to try to fix my friendship with another friend  that I also messed around with (never slept together though) because she  was a really good friend, and I really appreciate her. She said that  she would like to as well, that her only boundary was my ex of 6 years  because she doesn't feel comfortable with me talking to her or being in  contact with her.

        "text": "My gf and I have dated for 6 months. It has been a good relationship thus far. She has been very transparent with me, voluntarily, about her past. One of the guys she has mentioned was someone she had sex with a couple of times a couple of years ago. She told me that there was really nothing emotional between them, all he ever was to her was a dick appointment. And eventually, she wanted nothing to do with him and blocked him on everything except his number.\n\nWell, this guy has recently been persistent in trying to get back with her and texting her asking her out. She never responds and she will often show me and we both laugh at how desperate he is and move on with our day.\n\nHe ended up reaching out again and sent her a “genuine” text congratulating her for graduating. My gf screenshots it and sends it to me and it’s funny. We end up hanging out a couple days later and I ask her about the text and she shows me. The guy is asking her what she does for work now and basic catch-up stuff and she responds (too friendly for my liking since she was using “!!”). But no flirting is happening and she is merely answering his questions.\n\nUltimately, he sends a voice memo asking her out and she responds “I have dinner plans this weekend”. I get a bit upset for a couple reasons. Why is she bothering to respond to a guy who is obviously trying to get in her pants? And why did she not feel the need to mention me / boyfriend at all?\n\nShe could tell I didn’t like that she was responding and then offered to block. But I let the emotions get the best of me and got angry at her for even responding to him in the first place and not mentioning me. I asked her why she was even responding and she couldn't give me an answer. So I told her I needed a break.\n\nAfter some days of not texting each other, she calls me. Then, she proceeds to say I’m “insecure” and “controlling” and she has the right to be polite and respond. And that my response is unprompted. And that she didn’t mention me because there was no point since he is so irrelevant, the conversation was short, and it just matters she said no.\n\nWe’re tense now and not sure what to do. She is the type to never really get jealous or insecure of me - so maybe I am not being fair by giving her the same treatment? Any advice?\n\nTLDR: Gf was texting back a past “friends with benefits” who has been trying to reconnect for months. She didn’t hide the convo from me and was very transparent but I got upset she was responding to him in the first place and didn’t even mention me when he asked her out. She said I’m being controlling and insecure. Not sure what to do. Advice?",

He makes fun of people's weight and people's accents and cultures.\n\nHe lives with my grandparents rent free, does no chores, and  complains when they ask him for help or to take his dog outside.\n\nHe like living with a bully, I always tell him to stop making fun of me, but he never listens even when my dad gets involved. For years, I've had to deal with this and even hide my interests from him so he doesn't make fun of me.\n\nHe loves taking a stuffed cow I find comfort in, sleeping with, and holding when my anxiety gets high. He takes it from me and refuses to give him back until he gets bored,\nmaking fun of me. The one time I stood up to him, he got mad, I raised my voice because I thought he would rip him, and he hit me in the back of the head.\n\nI always try to stand up to him, but it never seems to work. He never stops or takes me seriously. I want advice on how I can stand up for myself better and if I can do something to get him to finally listen to me.\n\nTL;DR: I hate my I can't stand up to my uncle and need advice how to get him to finally stop.",

This is my first relationship and it lasted about a 9 months though I knew her for about two years before we started dating. In those 9 months, I feel that I've learned a lot about myself and realize that there are parts of myself that I really need to work on before I can be in a relationship. I feel guilty I can't give her the same support that she gives me and I feel that leading her on through my uncertainty is unfair. I am not completely sure of my decision though since I still care a lot about her. She is the most patient, caring girl I have ever met. But I just feel that she deserves better and that staying with her is taking her for granted when she could be with someone who doesn't have these doubts or issues to work through. I still want to be there for her if she needs me ever, though maybe thats just me being selfish so I feel less bad about breaking up with her. I know she really cares about me... \n\nA part of me is worried that she'll be the one that got away or that I'll really regret breaking up but I still feel that breaking up is best since I'll just feel more guilt since the things within myself will take time to fix.\n\nTL;DR: My gf cares too much and I am not ready. Want to know what others think/their own experience with such a problem. Did you regret?",

        "text": "So my bf and I have been together for 6 months. I was friends with his SO at the time and he was friends with my SO. Around the same time, both of our relationships ended and he and I wound up getting close. We eventually wound up in a relationship together. I found out not too long after we got together that he was still communicating with his ex- sending her money, telling her he loved her, etc. So I was extremely upset but because we had been spending so much time together, I formed an attachment and did not want to break things off but I did develop bad trust issues with him. Recently, I’ve put on some extra weight while my bf is now really into health and fitness. He’s been acting really weird- he has been sort of standoffish and distant with me. For example, we’ll both be in the living room watching something and all of a sudden he puts on his headphones and tunes me out. He’s been on his phone a lot more and has gone from having no social media to having Facebook and Instagram. I’ve seen him look at other more attractive girls on both platforms and with his recent behavioral changes, I’m thinking he’s cheating. Over Valentines Day and for about a week after he was super sweet but then he went back to being standoffish. I did end up breaking things off with him, but we live together now and it’s hard to stay broken up when you live with the person. We’re back together now but my suspicions are still there and everything he does I’m super critical of. He also called me fat yesterday. He said he was joking, but it was very hurtful especially since I know I’ve gained weight and I’ve been very vocal about how upset I am at myself for gaining and how I hate how I look. I don’t really know what to do here. Should I break things off? Should I confront him? And please do not comment on the age difference. I know it’s weird and it does make me uncomfortable at times which is another reason why I’m thinking of breaking things off\n\nTL;DR: Bf has been distant and standoffish, has a history of cheating, and called me fat. What should I do?",
