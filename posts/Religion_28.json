They’re both Christian’s, and raised me and my brother as such, but when I expressed that I was bored with church as I got older they listened. We tried a few other churches but eventually stepped back all together. Religion hasn’t been a part of my life since, but recently I’ve been thinking about it more.\n\nI don’t agree with some texts in the Bible, and especially not how it’s used by some to harm others. But I still find my prayers answered and good rewarded. I believe good things happen to people who do good, and vise versa. But bad things do sometimes happen as a trial, or to shape you into who you will become. \n\nI believe in Jesus, Christ, and the idea of “love thy neighbor”, but many of my beliefs go against that in the Bible. Are there others like this?",

        "text": "Hey folks, I'm wondering what some people's spiritual paths looked like -- in particular, anyone who may have left their religion and then later came back to it or found another?\n\nI was raised a catholic, ended up an edgy atheist type for a while, got into Eastern religions for a little bit, then ended up re-reading the bible and found it way more interesting in my own adult study as compared to when I was younger. I've also read the Gita and was a pretty big fan. I'm Islam-curious. I'm also Pagan (lol, broad) curious.\n\nI consider myself agnostic now - I believe fully in god on some sort of nebulous level - but I don't really abide by any particular belief system. My sense of ethics has been influenced strongly by Kant and his contemporaries.\n\nI'm hoping to gain some insight on how I can maybe charter my own path back to religion. I have an interest in finding a community, but, I also feel the need to reconcile some of my own beliefs with something more established -- if that makes sense.\n\nThanks for any sharing - will love to discuss.",

Why do we not need a direct line back to Jesus Christ himself? Who is to say who actually has authority and actually speaks for God?\n\nCatholics have their priesthood line of authority given from Christ, to Peter and so on. \n\nEspecially with the scripture in Matthew 16: 18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n\nAlthough my church believes the [authority was lost](https://youtu.be/4vx-xR-ry80), we still have a direct line of authority every priesthood holder can track straight back to Christ.

Everything was different. If you really want to follow the many standpoints in the bible, base your beliefs on the common beliefs that most people have in underdeveloped and conservative^10 countries and you’d be following “god”’s will since they are closer to the beliefs that most people in the roman empire had. (The israel we know today used to be the roman empire at the time) \n\nIt’s like most christians only use the bible as an excuse to why they think this and that but only when it’s convenient for them.\n\nThis post is not anti religious, this is just criticizing how some christians get their standpoints and opinions on certain topics. I’m not an atheist, but just wanted to share why basing your opinion on a library of books collected in one book, all of which not written or confirmed by jesus or god, but rather by different people",

Just as they culturally appropriated circumcision from Egyptians, Monotheism from Persians, Monarchism from Canaaneans, even probably YHWH cult from Edomites (mythologically described as Israelites stealing the blessing, but this theory is not proven), etc.\n\nIt would not be strange to think the idea of a Tabernacle would also be found in other Canaanean cultures.",

My dog Charlie, the alpha of the three, who usually listens the best (unless it involves a stranger) stopped immediately, the other two did not. I told them to stop again, well this time Charlie did what he normally does and started telling the other two to stop, he'll bite at their ears and paw at them to stop jumping. He listens to me and understands what I am telling him and then relays that information to the other two. \n\nDo they always listen? No. They get really excited. (they are Jack Russell Terriers) \n\nDoes he always listen? No, but he does a lot, and tries to get his brothers to comply. \n\nDoes this mean that I love him more than the other two? No, but it does mean that I will rely on him to relay messages to his brothers.\n\nI believe the prophets are just people who are trying to relay what they believe God wants. You can believe their stories or not, but why not just go directly to the source? He's speaking to all of us, if we just calm down and listen… \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the matter?",

        "text": "These are just some examples:\n - Christianity as an invention by Jewish people to subvert Rome. Typical anti-semitic conspiracy. Jews would never create an heretic belief system that jeopardize their own beliefs and directly compete with theirs.\n - Christianity as an invention by Rome to subvert Jews and Romans. This claim is weird. It bases itself on the fact that the Gospels encourage Christians to cooperate with the Authorities. However, Christian values of loving God and loving others are not compatible with Roman values of conquering and paganism. Also why would Romans wait 400 years to deploy this religion and then make it official? Nonsense.\n - Christianity as an invention by St. Paul to fight Rome or Jews or both. The fact is that St. Paul came relatively late to Christianity, after the Church of Jerusalem was well established. However, it is true a good part of the Christian canon was developed by Paul thanks to his Letters. Still many now-extinct Christian sects did not accept any of Paul's letters or authority.\n - Conspiracy by the Apostles. The claim is that the Apostles make it all up for some reason, but the fact is that Apostles were just a subset of many more Disciples. Apostles were also not the main source to write the New Testament.\n\nAll these factors influenced Christianity: Romans, Greeks, Jews, Hellenism, Paul's ideas, Platonism, etc. but that is far from inventing a religion as a conspiracy for an agenda, and many of these influences such as Hellenism actually came from an already Hellenized Judaism. \n\nApparently, a conspiracy about an authority engineering Christianity in the darkness is more believable for some than just another Jewish cult that grew by opening itself to gentiles and accepting Jesus as Messiah.\n\nNow, I understand that Christianity changed a lot when it became the Roman Empire's religion, probably as it took over the temples and places of Worship from Sol Invictus, and the Roman Pagan style, and as it distanced itself from Judaism more and more. However, the Christian Canon is still fundamentally Jewish (although, of course, not mainstream Jewish) and the values it promotes were mainly developed in Judaism but adapted to a Gentile's society.",

Right now she has supervised visits but that’s it.\n\nI’m Catholic, she’s agnostic. She told me, very sharply, not to bring him to Sunday Mass which I agreed too and haven’t taken him. I’m not looking to adopt him, it’s still her son, I’m just a placeholder until she can get her life together. \n\nBut Sunday morning I have someone to watch him while I go, and I just tell him ‘I’m going to church’ when he asks and nothings more said on it besides ‘no sweetie, stay with the babysitter’ when he asks to go. But my babysitter can’t watch him this Saturday, 1000% understandably, it’s Christmas Eve at midnight.  But my sister refused to let me take him when I mentioned it, and also she’s mad at me because every year along with all the Santa’s and reindeer and snowflakes, I put up my nativity, and my nephew asked me what that was and so I told him the Christmas story like as bare bones as I could. Like I tried to make *the nativity* secular, but when I told her, even that was too much and she threatened to call CPS.\n\nAnd I need to preface this by saying my sister never had ANY problems with me talking about religion with my nephew before. She’s always been agnostic but she could have cared less. Hell she was the one who gave me my cross necklace one year for Christmas, like she is NOT against religion. But she’s mad at me for having her son and every other thing I do ‘oh I don’t want you to do that. I don’t want him enrolled at that school, I don’t want him to wear those clothes, I don’t want him to go to go to your church, I don’t like you working nights, I don’t want you to have your dog around him’ like every single thing I do she says she doesn’t want it and I KNOW it’s just to annoy and frustrate me because I have custody right now.\n\nBut I also wanna respect her when it’s reasonable but idk.

        "text": "I joined the congregation of the Unitarian Church of Calgary back in 2013 - 2014 and recantly made the decision to officially step away after several years of contepleting weather it was right for me to stay.\n\nThe moment I stepped in I could feel the resentment gravitate towards me. And only assumed it was only in my direction. Overtime I found the sermons anti single white male (With the acception if the male was pro gay) , occasionally anti white male, Definatly transgendered had been allowed to do sermons in a near provocative manner.\n\nWhen we were given the right submit a private critique about the than pastor of the church, Minister Debra Faulk, I requested the sermons to be toned down on the anti single white male hate retorhic with little effort from the administration to have this happen. Rather, more of these sermons took place along side emviromental windmill power sermons which blamed Trump for not sparing enough money ontop of the already years of funding to pay for windmills; Transgendered sermons by members of the transgendered (male to female) community; sermons encouraging littile girls to go out and have emotional sex at individual will despite being anti male and promoting all male are rapists and just want sex; Only the anti white racist male sermons had been limited while the other types of sermons had grew.\n\nJust recantly as last years church season, the new church minister Rev. Shelly (A female minister from the US) held a service against a supposed act in which the Unitarian Universalist Association of American had discriminated against a femal immigrant wanting to become a churchs new minister by importing a Male to Female transgendered Minister to the congregation which had apparently caused an uproar of women in the Unitarian Universalist Association Council of America. I find this rather strange and intreguing as a transgender person from Female to Male which I actually enjoyed visited when this person took the time to get to the church came in had decided to leave out of the blue and notified me via email as this individual had felt they didnt like the direction the church was going. This email had been sent to me summer of 2020 I think it was.  The first thing that came time mind was [Dr. Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/@JordanBPeterson)'s notion of the use of our Prime Minister of Canada J. Trudeau using transgendered people as political pawns for money. This issue on transgendered had been a growing concern in my mind for sometime long before the covid shutdown even happened. My assumption was the Unitarian Church of Calgary was the only church on the planet engaging in behaviour which I had long been taught as abusive, invasive, and demeaning.",
