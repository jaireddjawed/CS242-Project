        "text": "Hi all,\nA while back I posted about how I am a lab manager for a big shot PI in psych. I just found out last week that I got into my PhD program that I've been eagerly waiting to hear from (yay!).\n\nHowever, as the last post pointed out, my current PI is very manipulative and often gaslights her lab. I officially accepted my offer yesterday, but things have gone from bad to worse at my current position.\nShe berated my work yesterday on a script that did exactly what she wanted but it wasn't done \"her way.\" She also was upset that I didn't update her on it but I saved an email saying that she didn't want updated until it was finished. I'm not an expert in any of this, and I'm the only one in the lab able to somewhat execute her plans (everyone else is a 1st year grad student or RA). Everything has fallen on my shoulders and she has especially pushed me when she heard that I will be leaving for my program soon. \n\nI am super afraid that she is going to try to sabotage my program if I put in my 2 weeks notice. She knows the other PI that I will be working under in my PhD. I'm worried that because she was a reference for me, if I quit, she will try to rescind her reference (I don't know if that's even possible lol), but it's driving me crazy. I'm at my wits end at this place. I have 3 months to go in my contract but things are so bad that I'm not eating or sleeping right. I'm holding this lab together and I feel like I'm somehow responsible for everything and everyone. She continually says that for me to be a successful student I need to be able to put up with this environment. \n\nMy new program and advisor are awesome though. I feel respected there and acknowledged. But my current PI is making me worry that my new advisor will be like her. I hope not all labs are this way üòï \n\nJust needed to vent again. It seems that reddit helps clear my mind when I talk to you all. \n\nThanks for reading.",

I brought this up with my advisor and they revealed that after some review of my application materials they felt I was a little under qualified too. They gave me some extra materials and work to review to better myself and while I spend the majority of my time (when not working) trying to review the extra work and given work for my course I‚Äôm still under equipped. I spoke to my advisor again about how I felt and in short our conversation went something like this:\n‚ÄúWe made a mistake admitting you without having prerequisites‚Äù\n‚ÄúYes we expect you to pay for this course again if you don‚Äôt succeed‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou should seek out prerequisite course work at a local school‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou should try harder too‚Äù\nI can‚Äôt help but feel like I have been setup to fail and a bit cheated out of my money (I haven‚Äôt gone to like a sham school or anything - I‚Äôm attending a pretty notable school). I‚Äôm posting here to just seek some advice on anything I can do to either get my money back since they made a mistake or a better course of action. As of now I‚Äôve got another masters program I deferred in my back pocket (that has already stated I‚Äôd need to take some extra classes to meet the prerequisites) but I‚Äôm just not sure where else to ask for advice. I don‚Äôt know anyone else who has done a masters",

I got multiple interviews that went really well and although I don't have any official offers yet, I am feeling a bit overwhelmed by the potential big life decisions I would have to make. \n\nThere is a joint masters program in EU that I am interested in and is split in two different countries (e.g France and Netherlands etc). At the same time I might get into great PhD programs in the US that I really liked. Choosing one or the other seems like an impossible decision for me. \n\nI would like to eventually get a PhD so it's great to have a head start by going to a PhD program right away, however I am not sure if I would like the locations as they are not very walkable and might make it hard for me to have fun. The European program is essentially diverse and international and I would get to spend at least 2 years in a different continent and might be able to finish up  my PhD in there as well. Moving to EU will allow me to be closer to family and buy me some time to have fun and travel before I start a PhD. At the same time, I am more inclined towards US PhDs because I like the system more and I like some of the labs better. \n\nI don't know if any of you will have an answer, but I will appreciate any insight.",

See below and if you respond, THANK YOU!! \n\n1) I hear even when you graduate with a masters of this nature that it‚Äôs hard to make money. What is realistic after schooling?\n\n2) Are there any jobs without any psychology degree that could help with tuition? For example, working as an advisor at the school I attend. I‚Äôm trying to find ways to make my cost for school go from 65k to 25-30k (if possible)\n\n3) I would love to be part of ketamine, mushroom, etc research and therapy. I‚Äôve seen it work wonders on me. Can I get this type of schooling and go in to those fields as they pop up years from now?\n\n4) I work in sales working 24/7 but I know going back to school will be a giant shift for me and my family.

If anyone from my program/lab sees this, it's pretty easy to figure out who I am, so hello!\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I let my previous boss talk me into going to a school (that frankly I was not excited about) because he works with my now PI. The PI is well known and puts out some great research. We didn't really have problems except that he is very hands-off. There were definitely red flags, but Jesus christ I did not realize how bad this would be. \n\nEverything has continuously gone downhill since I got here. The school fucked up my payment, so now I owe money. They fucked up my insurance, so now I owe money AND can't get more treatment until I jump through a million hoops. I had been working with a psychiatrist to get adhd medication right, but since they just switched my insurance, I can't see him anymore. The current meds are making me so emotional and I cannot.stop.crying. like, it's horrific, I've never been a crier and now it's everyday and in public. \n\nI was a part of the UC strike, and my PI has been retaliating because he knows he's untouchable. He pretty much said if any of us file a complaint, he will retaliate even harder. It's been miserable. During the strike I decided I'm definitely going for a masters and not a PhD because this sucks so hard. My PI has not helped me clarify what my project even is so idk what I'm even supposed to be doing day to day in the lab. I'm doing well in my classes and have a 4.0, but my lab work is not going well. \n\nI need something to change or else I'm going to go crazy.  It's only been about 6 months and I'm so fucking over this schools incompetence destroying my love for what I do. I could switch PIs but that would probably set me back progress wise which would suck because I want to leave this state asap. I'm probably just going to try any cry/power my way through the next year and some change, but I need somethibg to get better. \n\nDoes anyone have advice or experience with this kind of thing?",

        "text": "Hi all, for some context, I am in my fourth year of college (graduating in May) for a B.S. in Microbiology in the United States. My long term goal is to get into research/being a professor with Infectious Disease, which would require getting my PhD. However, currently I am not ready (and have also past many deadlines) to apply to a PhD. For my after graduation plans, I am looking for opportunities that will put me in a better position to apply and will set me up to be successful in academia.\n\nThis week I received an acceptance to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for their MSc in Immunology and Infectious Disease. I actually don't know much about this school at all and heard about it for the first time while looking up places to apply to. It would be around 40k USD (although I'm looking into scholarships) and one year long, but the program itself looks really interesting and like a good start into putting together my own research.\n\nI am also applying to and waiting to hear back from jobs here stateside. These would positions as a Research Assistant in labs within hospitals and universities - good for observing and contributing to research within immunology and ID. Financially it seems like a no brainer to stay within my home country, make money and then apply, but I am lucky to have the means to attend the MSc program. \n\nI am talking to professors/advisors, but I would be the first in my family to pursue this level of education, so I just wanted to ask here for some advice too. Is anything notably beneficial about either getting a masters (keeping in mind it is abroad) or working for two years in a lab? Has anyone heard of this school before and have advice regarding it? Is anyone willing to share which pathways they took to starting their PhD and how how that translates to what they would do if they were me?",

I already have a very good job in aviation so this degree would be more of a back-up in case I ever had to stop flying. I already have a master's in education and I am great with soft skills but lacking in the STEM fields (especially math--it's been about 20 years since my last math course). \n\n\nDegrees I'm considering are a master's in management, MBA, or supply chain management. There are so many fields and degrees out there that I'm overwhelmed with options. I'm looking for a degree that would make me the most employable with the potential to earn the most money but without a lot of math requirements. \n\n\nI thought supply chain management would be good because I already have so much experience in the transportation industry and the coursework looks doable. (only 2 math classes). If anyone has any other suggestions, I'd appreciate it as there are just so many options and there may be degrees/fields that I haven't even considered.",

My first illness involved my gall bladder in my first and second semester. I had to deal with constant pain and problems until I had insurance and surgery in my second semester. I got past it and then boom pandemic. Literally the week I should have come back from surgery. Fine. I found a lab I loved and worked really hard pursing this area of interest and taking classes. No thesis in sight though. I dealt with small various illnesses due to my autoimmune disease and allergies thay are being treated with shots. I had a few reactions. Had mental health troubles got on meds.  2021 comes along my meds are working im feeling great and then my advisor was being a total B. The project I was told could be my thesis was no longer on the table and we had a falling out when I called her on this and I chose a new advisor. That was the year I almost lost my marriage due to ignoring my partner for school, for this advisor and was blaming every issue on him \"taking my time\". After the stuff with my advisor my eyes were open to the fact that no one truly had my best interest in mind except my husband. We decided to start trying for kids and decided on a more simple path to a thesis. Or so I thought. I started piloting in January 2022. I had my first miscarraige in April. It took a minute to get on my feet. I had my second miscarraige in July. I was destroyed. I was in and out of doctors offices for months and got a diagnoses in December with the information that being pregnant will be high risk, expensive and I will have to take these shots everyday that do not sound great as they cause a lot of discomfort and bruising. My pilot finally ended in November but December was a wash with the news and holidays. So I thought in the spring I would get back to it focus up, work a lot and finish by may or August of this year. Boom H. Pylori infection. Allergic reactions to multiple antibiotics. Now here I am end of January with a terrible stomach infection and waiting for insurance to approve the antibiotic I need. Ive lost all this weight, im exhausted because my diet is so strict to help my stomach and every other day or so I end up too sick to go to my work site or have to leave early. This spring will be a full year behind when I \"should have\" graduated according to this degree plan. We now have a ton a debt from hospital visits this year. Im feeling like I dont remember anything I have learned. Its like my head is empty most of the time. I have no excitement or passion.  How on earth can I possibly finish this out in a way I can be proud of? I feel like a joke when it comes to academia now. I want to give up but need my degree for my certification once I graduate so I cam finally have a family and support said family. Has anyone else had a journey that felt like the universe was against them? How do you manage to get through the home stretch feeling like shit physically and mentally? I mentally checked out most of last year with everything thinking I would have this semester to jump to it. And here I am.",

We want to buy in PA because prices are more reasonable than in the NYC suburbs that we are currently renting in. I was born and raised in PA so I know the area well and my husband spent a few years there as well for work. The plan is that both of us will be employed full time by the time we permanently move to PA. We both have a great credit history and almost no debt.\n\nMy new job offers tuition reimbursement and has connections with local schools where I could be offered a discount on tuition but I am unsure of which schools at this point. I have been toying with the idea of getting my MBA for about 10 years now and I am thinking at this point in my career, this is the right time to do it.\n\nThe thing about it is, I would need to apply for loans if I decide to go to grad school. With this plan, I would be asking for 2 very large loans within a year of each other. I did some googling and while there are a TON of articles on buying a home while having student loan debt, there isn't anything mentioned about the other way around which is my case....buying a home first, then getting a grad school loan.\n\nIs the reverse situation something that anyone else has done? What has been your experience working with lenders and would buying a house so soon impact my ability to get a loan for school?\n\nThank you for your help!",

I'm a humanities student working on my second chapter out of four, initially I was hoping I could finish my PhD by May (when I run out of funding) and have a full time non-academic job lined up. However, writing is rather slower than I anticipated, my family were slammed with sickness and someone was laid off, and suddenly the depression is real. It's SO fucking hard to even want to get out of bed at the prospect of 1) overcoming a mountain of writing under a deadline, b) applying for extra funding which would give me so much relief but I don't think I have a high chance of, c) engaging in a difficult non-academic job search during a recession.\n\nTrying to take it one week at a time but I'm not a robot who can predictably churn out XYZ number of words five days a week. Some weeks are fellowship deadlines, some weeks a job posting comes up, some weeks I have family things to attend to, and some weeks I churn out almost half a chapter. It's difficult to get so much done when life feels unpredictable. When I feel overwhelmed it's hard to want to socialize with friends, go to exercise classes, take care of older family members, or do creative things. I just want to curl up and watch TV and numb it all out.",

My TA position covers my tuition and I get a stipend, so I'm trying not to be ungrateful, but I've been feeling so depressed lately trying to get everything done. I work over 50 hours a week, and most of my job is glorified babysitting when I'm TAing students. I am overqualified to show 18yo kids how to make an LED light up. I've been so angry recently, why did the department set it up like this? \n\nSome of my coworkers have their tuition and stipend paid for by a company, so they have more time for research. However, it seems like most of them don't dedicate this extra time to their research and they fuck off and don't do anything. I swear one person doesn't work more than 4 hours a day, her advisor is mad at her for her lack of progress, and they still cut her TA hours and give her industry money. Why am I, the person who has racked up the most publications out of all of us, forced to work myself to the bone TAing, doing my homework for the unnecessary extra class my advisor made me take, and research.\n\nI am going INSANE trying to get everything done, and I don't know what to do. I'm not going to go to the department and snitch on my coworker, and I feel like he won't listen to me anyway. I'm so disgusted with my department. Anyway, my rant is over.",

        "text": "My advisor is brilliant, and I thoroughly respect and admire her approach and way of thinking.  But I tend to feel (and perhaps even act) like an incompetent fool during meetings. I have pulled a couple of all-nighters before meetings, and ironically end up with nothing to show for it. I've also blanked out a couple of times when discussing details, so I don't think I can expect her to trust my judgement or ability. My ideas usually get very politely turned down (there's a good reason for it) so I don't have the confidence to propose an ambitious project of my own. But when I go to conferences and meet other people in the field, I feel a little less like a nincompoop because they don't seem to think that my ideas aren't worth looking at (I've had a couple of people ask me to email them regarding details, and have received advice on how to pursue them). I'm not saying that I'm being underestimated by my advisor, but in her eyes, I think I'm probably her worst advisee. I'm working on a joint project with another of her other students, and I find my voice being drowned out since the suggestions/future directions are discussed with him more often, rather than when both of us are together or when I meet with her individually (of course, he meets with her earlier too, so that's also a reason). But I get the impression that my advisor thinks it's more of my co-first author's project rather than joint work. It doesn't help that he (my co-first author) has more high impact work, and is generally more confident.\n\nI don't want to get into the rabbit hole of comparing myself to someone else, but I would appreciate some advice on how to be more confident and not let my nerves get to me when I meet with my advisor. I've been working on being more organized, but I suppose it would help to not feel like a bundle of nerves when I meet because I'm usually not this nervous when talking to other profs.",

Ideally I'd go to LSE, LBS, HEC, ESCP, or something similar. \n\nHowever, I'm a bit worried that my application wouldn't be as competitive being that I don't have econ/finance/management background. I have both research and work experience, but they are both in the field of law, completely unrelated to the aforementioned fields.\n\nDoes my law experience hinder a business school application? Should I strive to pursue more business-oriented professional experience/extra-curriculars? Or should I continue with my focus on law?",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI have 2 supervisors. They are both excellent people and I do like them. But I find myself oftentimes in these awkward situations where they both want things that are directly opposing what the other wants in terms of research/experiments and more. They frequently don't communicate with each other.   \n\n\nI'm now working on my permission to write and so many things are these awkwardly assembled pieces of wtf where I am just trying to make a coherent document without any guidance from either of them in the past 2 months. I've never written a document like this before and was told \"Just ask a friend for their permission to write\". I sent in my first draft and they want to have a meeting to discuss it tomorrow -  they both have opposing ideas and are tearing my work apart. Then they don't like how a bunch of data was processed and interpreted, I had sent them comprehensive reports previously breaking it all down in detail and they're now developing issues with it after I spent months on this document. Some of the issues with the data were brought up over a year ago and it was shrugged off but NOW it's an issue. \n\nThere is a whole bunch of other things too, but getting into it would probably get this post to the point where I could be identified by someone.\n\nI'm just so frustrated with the inconsistency and the lack of support. We were supposed to meet every 2 weeks - nope every 2 months. \n\nThis is partly just me ranting, but what is the best way to approach discussing these things with them? I know they aren't meaning for the situation to be like this and I intend to continue to work with the one supervisor in the future once I graduate as my field is fairly small.",
