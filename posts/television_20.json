The duo is like a combination of Paul Glaser and David Soul and Keenan and Kel with Rowland adding refreshing subtlety and funny faces in some of the more predictable jokes. Emily Prince played by Vella Lovell is priceless and with Grace Palmer and Ravi Patel they have a endless amount of directions they can take the scripts. What I think it will take to get on the level of a show like The office or Parks and rec are not only reoccurring jokes which resonate with the viewers but also the introduction of more characters who add to the comedy and dynamics of the main 5 characters.",

I don't know how or why but it went from somewhat slow and plodding to very quick witted, engaging, funny, and also emotionally hard hitting. \n\nIts only 6 eps which is an awfully light first season. I hope next season has at least 8, I mean episode numbers seem to keep shrinking these days, its getting a bit silly. \n\nHarrison Ford is great as the grumpy old therapist, my favorite performance by him in a long time. The gay dude is a bit too tropey and stereotypical for me, but overall it has plenty of interesting engaging characters and lots of witty back and forth exchanges. I say watch it. \n\nAlso I am not gay and would be interested in what actual gay people think of the gay character.",

        "text": "I'm 31. I watched Billy &amp; Mandy all the time as a kid and loved it, but that was almost 20 years ago, so my memory of the show was almost non-existent at this point. There are dozens of cartoons from my youth that I still rewatch, but for some reason Billy &amp; Mandy fell into a void as I grew up and I just never saw it again.\n\nA week ago I asked my girlfriend if she had ever heard of it and she hadn't, so I put a random episode and we were both surprised at how much we were laughing. I had assumed it'd be a nice piece of nostalgia to see again, but I wasn't expecting it to be such a well written show that somehow got away with some of the darkest body horror and adult jokes I have ever seen in a children's cartoon, even moreso at times than Ren &amp; Stimpy. I have no idea how the censors allowed this show to exist.\n\n\nI guess it didn't end well though, since it was eventually unceremoniously cancelled and apparently the creator Maxwell Atoms was publicly insulted by the President of Cartoon Network at the time in front of everyone, who said Mr. Atoms had ruined the channel with his *\"hateful fart cartoon\"*, and then was promptly fired. He also tried to get a Billy &amp; Mandy movie made in the past few years, but was told by execs that modern children have never heard of the show, so it wouldn't make sense to bring it back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave any of you rewatched it as adults? If not, I recommend revisiting it. We have been devouring episodes, sometimes for hours, and somehow I never get annoyed by Billy's relentless screaming. I think this might retroactively be my favorite Cartoon Network show now.",

        "text": "Lidia Poet is an Italian series streaming on Netflix.  6 hour long episodes.  From this year, so there may be another season.\n\nLidia Poet was a real person, but the show is fiction.  It is set in late 19th century Italy.  She is trained as a lawyer but as a woman is not allowed to practice law.  She relies on her brother, a lawyer, as her way to access legal cases.  Much of the show is about her trying to do what a woman is not supposed to or allowed to do.\n\nEach episode is case and a mystery.  There is basically no court proceedings - she solves the mystery outside of court.  The mysteries are okay, but there is as much emphasis on her trying to investigate than on the actual investigation.\n\nThere is a bit of Sherlock Holmes with her spotting clues, making deductions, and using \"modern\" investigation techniques like fingerprints and a lie detector.\n\nLike Enola Holmes there is also anarchists in the mix.\n\nIt is essentially a drama with some mystery and a bit of humor.  And some nudity.  Not a ton of nudity, but being an Italian show it is just there casually.  When she and her lover are in bed her breasts are exposed.\n\nWatch it if you like period pieces and episodic mysteries.",
