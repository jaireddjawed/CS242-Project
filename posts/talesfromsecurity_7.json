        "text": "I had just strolled into my store around 9 am. I punched in, made small talk with the girl working customer service, bought my canned double espresso, and made my way to the office. As I flicked on the light and looked around, I knew that I wasn't the last one in the office. Papers were all over, the chair pushed out. '\"God dammit, Tim.\", I muttered under my breath. I clean up the papers and what appears to be dried ranch dressing, sit down and pull up the live video feed. After browsing the cameras for about 10 minutes, I decide to take a walk around the store to let the employees know that I'm in the store. \n\nbuzz buzz\n\nI reached into my pocket and grabbed my phone. Wouldn't you know it? Tim sent me a picture of 2 suspects, a male and a female.\n\nApparently, over the past 2 weeks they hit the store 2 times and got away, unscathed. She acted as a lookout, while he grabbed and stashed the merchandise. 2 bottles here, 4 bottles there. Tim got word about the subjects from employees who worked those days. And Tim, as diligent as he is, would not only save the video and stills from the camera system, but also filed a police report on the incident. The suspects showed that they were repeat customers, so it was basically a waiting game.\n\nI respond to Tim's text, saying \"Well after all that work you did, I hope I catch him and steal your glory.\" Tim's response shakes me a little. \"Good. He's a big guy. Will probably try to fight.\" I try to brush it off by saying something macho like, \"I hope he does. I haven't had a good fight in a while.\"\n\nFor us, lunchtime typically is around the 4 hour mark. I'm sitting in the office alone, munching on some pre-cut veggies while casting my gaze between the live video monitor, and Episode 3 of True Detective. In between episodes, I happened to look up at the right camera, at the right time. I couldn't believe it. They're here. No way. I pull out my phone, rewind the video a few seconds and sure enough. There he his. The male is wearing the exact same outfit as he was in the picture Tim sent me from 3 days ago and the female's hairstyle was undeniably identical.\n\n\"So, here they are 94needsassistance. Served to you on a Silver platter. What are you gonna do?\", I thought to myself. My heart slammed in my chest, I started feeling the adrenaline pumping. Yes. YES. I love this feeling. I pick up the phone, and page over the loud speaker \"Charlie in grocery please dial 201 for department 94. Charlie in grocery, 201 for 94.\" Within a couple seconds, the phone rings. \n\n\"Hey man. What's up? Whatcha got?\" I can hear the excitement in Charlie's voice. He loves backing us up, 1.) because he gets to brag about it later, and 2.) He gets to put his work load on hold to help me. \"I have a male, who matches the description of a previous offender, in the store right now. Where are you?\" \"I'm by Floral. What does he look like?\" I gave him the descriptions, and sure enough they were just on the edge of his department. I tell Charlie to keep an eye, but maintain distance. I did not want to spook them, and have them leave with nothing. \n\nI bolt out of the office, hustle down the stairs to the back room, and start peaking through the warehouse doors to see if I can get a location on them. Sure enough, they are just strolling through the Deli with a shopping cart. The male has what appears to be a shopping list that he begins to glance at. I pull my phone out again to compare the photo with the male standing 30 feet away from me. It's him. I'm 100% positive.\n\nAs he's looking at his grocery list, he makes his way to the Meat Department. People who steal meat are easy to spot. They don't look at price or weight. They just grab. But that's not what he was doing. He appeared to be examining each package very closely. To me it looked weird. I became more curious as to what he was looking for, so I decided to do a slow roll by. As I looked over his shoulder, I saw what I previously thought was his grocery list in his right hand. It was a receipt. He was double shopping. I saw the word Meat in bold letter on the paper, and it clicked. He was trying to get a matched weight on the items so he could either return it, or walk out with it and present the receipt if stopped at the door. I had him, now all I had to do was watch him. I backed off, watching from various positions in different aisles. He moved from the prepackaged ground beef, to the Butcher's counter where he ordered a specific weight of store brand ground beef and pork chops, and then he finished up with prepackaged chicken drumsticks. As I watched from a distance, he appeared to be scratching the package of drumsticks. I went in for a closer look, and sure enough he was taking the printed price off of the tag. When he was done, he walked up Aisle 2, over to Aisle 3 and bagged his chicken in a store plastic bag that he pulled from his pocket. I've got him.\n\nAs he continues his way to the front of the store, he bags up his porkchops and ground beef and breezes through the Self-Checkout Area. The employee working the area sees him, opens her mouth to say something, sees me 10 feet behind him and backs off. Charlie was right at my heels as we waited for the male to exit the store. He's out the first door, and just as the second door opens I grab the back of his collar and the back of his sleeve. \"Store Security. You forgot to pay for those items, sir. Would you mind coming back in with me?\" Charlie had weaseled by and was standing, blocking his exit. He was caught. He knew it. \n\n\"Now there's a couple ways this will go. You come peacefully, we let you pay for the items you forgot to pay for and you enjoy the rest of your day like nothing happened. Or you do something stupid, end up on the floor hurt and in handcuffs. It's your choice what happens next.\" I saw his wheels begin to turn. He looked at Charlie, looked back at me and replied \"I'm already having a shitty day. I'll come peacefully.\" AWESOME.\n\nAs we climb the stairs to the office, I know for a fact his day will get worse in about 30 seconds. We enter the office, I put the bags down and he plops down in a chair like he's done this before. I ask for his ID and he complies. I look it over for a minute, look at Charlie and ask the male to stand up and face the wall. He has a panicked look on his face. Charlie steps closer. \n\n\"I thought you said you we're gonna let me go?\" \"Look man. This is a small office, I don't know you. I need to check you for weapons. It's for my safety. There ain't nothing else to it.\" \"Alright, fine. Watch the back pocket though. There's some small glass in there.\" \"Ok...is it a pipe?\" \"Yea.\"\n\nI am absolutely giddy. I now have a bargaining chip. It's a short pipe used to smoke crack cocaine. To me it looks like a million dollar bill.\n\n\"Ok man. I need you to put your hands behind your back. At this point you are being detained, not arrested, until we figure this out.\" \"Man, really? I gotta sit in cuffs? C'mon. I'll be good.\"\n\nclick click\n\nAs soon as the cuffs are on and secured, I let him in on the good news for me, and the bad news for him as I awaken my sleeping computer. I turn his attention to the screen and ask if he sees anyone he recognizes. He looks at the screen and puts his head down. \n\n\"Ok. So what does that mean?\" he mumbled to his shoes. \"Well, Mr. XYZ, I currently have 2 open cases on you for retail theft, not including today.\" \"So...\" I could see the gears turning again \"Am I getting arrested?\" \"Yep!\" I chirped. \"But you said if I was good, you'd let me go! You piece of shit! You fucking lied to me.\" I turned my office chair to face him, looked him in the eye and said, \"I'd rather be called a liar, than thief.\"\n\nAfter the police left, I called Tim. \"Well he didn't fight.\" \"You caught him??! AWESOME! Make sure you give me honorable mention.\"",

        "text": "(Hi! My name is Dustin. I'm 25, Work as an Armed licensed private detective(Investigator)/ Security officer, In a Run down Town in Ohio. I've Been working my Beat over a year now. I've worked security since i was 19 years old, Police academy certified training. The Company i work for deals with a lot of rough areas involving Heavy gang activity and Drug transactions. We work a lot of Section 8 properties and deal with a lot of crap, make frequent detentions for felonies, and for our safety. I've been threatened death, Assaulted, even shot at one night. I have lots of stories.All names are changed from real events.)\n\nA few weeks back the other officers in my company and myself began getting reports from the local residents about a middle aged, 300+ lbs, African american,female walking around the property in a moo moo(night gown). The woman was reported to urinate and defecate frequently at random locations around property. The local residents began referring to her as \"Pee pee lady\" For a few days we thought she was a joke or even pretend, like a ghetto sort of big foot.\nThen we finally spotted her entering a stairwell into building five. We came in behind her, and saw her try to open the door to unit B2. I asked her if she lived on our property and she told me no.\n I quickly realized by her answers and from brief general conversation that she was either under the influence of some sort of substance, or had a mental disorder. for example:\n I would say something like \"Ma'am if you don't live here you gotta leave, ok?\" to which she would reply\n\"I live on earth, no force can tell me where i can not live. The Earth is my home\"\nDue to either her disorder or substance abuse we had a hard time conversing with her and explaining that she couldn't be on the property. She was convinced that the resident of unit B2 of building 5 was her aunt.(Her aunt had died a long time previously and hadn't lived in the apartment for at least five years. It was now occupied by a middle aged male)\nAfter a few days of encountering her we quickly learned that after she went around defecating and urinating on property she would always return to Building five to try and be let in to B2. The backside of her nightgown was always covered in urine or fecal matter. As the days passed our patience was growing thin with her, and we issued a ban notice to her, not that she could comprehend that well enough, but we had to try and make legal strides to keep her off property. Eventually our conversations went from \"Ma'am you need to leave the property\" to \" Ma'am if you return to our property we are going to have to detain you with handcuffs and hand you over to local authorities.\"Which seemed to make her understand we didn't want to see her around anymore. And for a few days she didn't come back. There were no reports of Pee pee lady anywhere. We thought it was over....But dear god were we wrong.\n\nAfter almost one week of being Pee Pee free, we get a call on our emergency cell phone from the tenant of building 5, B2. The man was hysterical and screaming \"YO DAWG, PEE PEE GIRL IS BREAKING INTO MY HOUSE, MAN!!! SHE BASHING IN THE DOOR YA'LL!!!! HELP ME!\" My partner and i Run across the entire property to get to building five. We found the door open, clear signs of broken entry, the tenant was standing outside pointing \" She is in the kitchen, jesus christ!\" We entered the apartment with pistols at low ready, we didn't know if she had a weapon. We found her on all fours in the kitchen, Eating a solid block of Velveeta cheese like an animal. Her lips were bleeding quite severely because she had taken the Tenants cologne off of the shelf and bit off the top of the container and drank its contents (for what i could only assume was alcohol?) She smelled like the strongest, eye watering, potent, perfume you could possibly imagine. Her face was covered in blood, and cheese. Her ass was covered in poop, she was 300 lbs, pissed, and growling/Screaming at us \"THIS IS MY CHEESE! DON'T YOU DARE COME NEAR!!!!!\" We holstered our weapons and went hands on, yes she fought like a monster, she tried biting and scratching. Yes, My partner and i did get covered in cheese,blood, and poo. We finally got her cuffed and called The local police. They took her away, and i never fully found out what happened to her. We did our paper work, Got relieved by our superiors, disposed of our uncleanable uniforms. I took 3 showers that night/day. I also went to my doctor the following day for blood work ,as i did get a lot of poop and blood on me. No hep C, or Aids. Clean bill of health, although...nothing will ever quite make me feel clean again. :/",

        "text": "I work for a private housing authority, and tonight my partner and I were on patrol. Tonight there were lots of happy and not so happy drunks out after the fight. Most were moving so no real issue, but as we round a corner we both spy two males that were not like the rest.\n\nOne appeared to be making aggressive movements toward the other, we will call him Jose. The other was not trying to get away and it looked like he was engaging in a conversation, we will call him Miguel. We keep walking and watching but our view gets obstructed by a line of cars. We both hear a thud, it sounded like a high five, but as we rounded the corner it was clear that the Jose had just hit Miguel. We rush over and Jose takes off in a run, I give chase but he had a good lead and ducked off property. Defeated, I return to my partner and Miguel. My partner had started to take down information as best as he could, as Miguel along with a fist had taken about six beers to the face. His English was not bad even after being filtered through all that alcohol.\n\nMiguel tells us that he knows Jose, and gives us his name. He tells us that they had known each other for a long time and he is not sure why Jose hit him. While he is talking I notice that his fly is down, and my gaydar is pinging pretty hard so some scenarios start to play out in my head. As a gay man myself this just makes me even more mad that we did not step in sooner.\n\nWe ask if Miguel would like us to call the police, he says he would and at that time we see blue lights just around the corner so we all walk over.\n\nA couple of cops are conducting a traffic stop and at a natural break I hollar over and ask when they are done if they could come over and talk to us, they agree and we all set about waiting. The lights from the police car make evident just how bad Miguel got hit. His lip is bleeding and there is a huge knot on his forehead. He chit chats with us and asks if I workout and where I live because his gym is 24 hours.\n\nAfter what seemed like forever one of the cops comes over and asks whats up. While Miguel was telling him, it was clear that he had pieced together all the same scenarios that I had. He asks who the other man was and Miguel tells him all he knew. The cop then, with about as much compassion and understanding for the victim as a cactus, throws his hands out and goes \"what do you want me to do with just his name? Since you don't know his address and I cant get his side, why don't you go home and sleep it off.\" Miguel then puts his head down and nods before walking off. The cop then looks at us and said \"sorry he wasted your and my time,\" I responded with \"looking out for the residents is our job, so no biggie for us\" The cop nods clearly not catching my discontent before walking off.\n\nIf only we had been a few seconds earlier in our patrol, or if only that cop had given just a tad more fucks this poor guy would not have gotten slugged or made to feel like it was somehow his fault he got slugged and to just man up about it.\n\nFrustrating.\n",

        "text": "Righto. Tonight. Fuck me it was hectic. \n\nOff the hotel security, got burnt from the contract. They wanted a Doberman that sits, stays, and attacks on command. I gave em the backyard dog that yaps to make people laugh and growls when people get aggro at the family. They wanted Terminator, I gave em C3PO. What I'm saying is unrealistic expectations, and stuff that literally goes against near two decades of experience. Staff loved me. Patrons loved me. The goddamn Hotel Owner invited me and the missus to his VIP box for the Australia Day Cricket match. But as I didn't dance to the Gaming Managers tune, Greedy got the burn notice. \n\nFuck that guy is what I'm saying here. \n\n*swigs Tullamore Dew* \n\nAnyway, I digress. \n\nAfter sorting out a replacement for me at the Hotel (oh, forgot to mention it was MY FUCKING CONTRACT) I slide back into the good ol Gaming Room contract I have a love/hate relationship with, the place where most of my tales come from. \n\nAnd fuck me, in the 3 months I was absent from it, it was it a mess. Banned patrons and Self Exclusions walking around like they owned the joint. Dealers had shifted back on site too, as it's a central location to meet with clients due to it's proximity to various nightclubs, including the one next door. It's basically a waiting room for em.\n\nAnd thus, my tale of tonight's woe begins. \n\n*knocks back the rest of my Scotch*\n\nYes I'm narrating that, I'm drunk. Shaddap. \n\nRight, so I'm working with Johnny, the bloke I sorted out to replace me when I shifted to the twice accursed Hotel. You'd look at this fella, and snort. But he is one if the most fearless Crowdies (what we call Bouncers) I've ever worked with. No hesitation in any way shape or form. \n\nI'm on start at 1900, spend the first few hours kicking back, refusing a few people hitting it hard so they don't buy overpriced drinks at the club next door. The door staff come on at the club, say g'day and touch base with a few blokes I haven't chatted with in a fair bit. \n\nJohnny boy rocks up, enthusiastic greeting. He was one of my first hires, never regretted it. He too was burnt from the thrice damned Hotel for similar reasons. \n\nSeriously, fuck you Daniel. \n\nAnywho, shift progresses as usual. Drunk knock backs at the front with Johnny, reiterated at the back door with me. Had to move a bum that was scamming drinks off people. He smelt like despair and garbage. Fuck that guy too, gunna hafta dry clean my damn suit. \n\nAround Midnight, had 2 blokes and 3 chicks rock up. Imma call em Tall, Short, Fat, Thin and Meh in that order of gender. They were a tad... well, *intense* is the word I would use in polite company, *'Flying hard'* for people in the know. Y'see, this particular contract is know to be pretty lax with its entry standards. Basically if your junk was covered and you had money in your hand, by all means, come in! So we let em slide. \n\nThey wander, have a drink, chatting away at hyper-speed when they could unclench their jaws. 20 minutes later, they bail. Sweet, no more extra work for Greed and Johnny. \n\nThen the manager found a bag. Keep in mind that us Crowdies had no idea what was happening till further on, and I only know this as it was filled in later. \n\nHe's spotted a bag on his rounds, and taken it back behind the bar. As he's out it down, he noticed something off; a few wallets, worn and used. \n\nThis is the part where I mention he is a brown-nosing mofo, and as such wanted to keep the following glory to himself. \n\nUpon further investigation of the bag, he finds more than 20 gutted wallets (wallets stripped of cash) a knife, a fucking Smith and Wesson and at least 100g of Ice (Methamphetamine) in a lunchbox. Does he tell us? No. Why would he share in the glory coming? He immediately calls 000 (Our 911) as the five have now returned and are frantically cutting laps around the venue looking for the bag.\n\nCue Greed standing at the front door after I swap with Johnny. I notice a Divi van (paddy wagon) pull up across the road. *Fair enough* I think, probably doing spot checks on sites and security. I grab my licence and put it in my top pocket so I can whip it out if needs be. \n\nThen the second Divi rocks up. \n\nAnd a third. \n\nThen a Meat Wagon. (riot van/Mobile drunk tank/lockup) \n\n*Dafuq is going on here?*, I thought. \n\nNext thing you know I have more than a dozen 5-0 strutting over to me. \n\n'Who's your manager?' A Sargent barks at me, one of the few CBD cops I don't know. \n\n*'that would be BrowNose sir, he's at the bar.'* I reply, still having no fucking idea what is happening.\n\n15 cops walk into my venue. Immediately, Short, Fat and Meh shoot out the back door. Tall and Thin shoot straight past me. All are rounded up within the minute. \n\nDrama dies down, Short, Fat and Meh get locked up. Short (who the bag belonged too, apparently) put up enough struggle to be dog piled by the cops. \n\nSo, here's Greedy looking like a tool. \n\nAfter arrests were made, details given etc etc I have a minute with BrownNose. I lose my shit. Conversation follows, not verbatim as I'm drunk as a skunk: \n\n*'Why the fuck wasn't I informed?!?'*    \n'I didn't want to give it away to them.'    \n*'So, instead of telling us what was goin on so we could stop em if they ran, you decided to keep this quiet?!? Even when we could have stopped the cunts when they did run?'*    \n'Well yeh, I...'    \n*'...Knowing that it breaches a fuckton of our S.O.P's, including preventing an indictable offense with the drugs, knife and a fucking GUN?!? Not to mention making me look like a fucking muppet when the cops rocked up as I had no idea why they were there?'*\n\nHe didn't have much to say of note after that. \n\nTo throw a cherry haphazardly on top of this shitcake, there was a Channel 9 (local news) Van out front, so there is a good chance imma be on the news tomorrow. More fuel for my folks bitching at me to get a new profession. \n\n*finishes Scotch, pours another* \n\nSo, how the fuck was your day lads?\n",

Negotiations start at 20 bucks a head. If you can't squeeze that then enjoy the line.\n\n4. I'm bigger and fight more often, trust me. Plus I have a nifty radio with more than ten other me's on the other end. I dont care how many tapout shirts you bought or your \"Krav maga\" classes. No touchie of me or my ropes or you end up in cuffs or hospital. Savvy? Cool.\n\n5. I don't know you and I'm not your bro. Assume neither. \n\n6. The other guy who lets you in every time? Yeah he isn't here. Bye Bye.\n\n7. Too many people just walk right up to the ropes with the expectation of being let in. Mainly women. A lot of women in their 40s. They just stand there tapping their foot. With the \" Excuse me\" look on their face like I just made her coffee and really let her down. Listen bitch I didn't let you down, time did, HARD. They always then just say- \"Its 4 of us for drinks?\" I without fail respond every time with \"Oh that must be nice, to have friends.\" and then go back to not giving a fuck.\n\n8.When your friends are in the head- and your booty call booklet has been exhausted of victims to mindlessly text clever bullshit to, do not speak to me. I really REALLY don't care where you are from, why you are here or what your plans are with the boys. You are just another obstacle from me going home where I know there is beer.\n\n9. And finally a story about this kid who dropped the N-bomb to a black co-worker of mine. I'm a big white boy- Call me what you want. I never suffered injustice because of it. Well my co- worker contained himself because he was on his final warning and thought we were on camera. They fucking love me where I'm at and I happened to know we were in a blind spot so I bitch slapped the kid. 3 times. He tried throwing a punch and i almost broke his arm slamming it into the Valet stand. Threw 3 hard right uppercuts to his solar plexus and kicked him in the ass so his face hit the concrete. DO NOT EVER BRING THAT RACIST SHIT UP TO A BOUNCER, YOU'LL LOSE TEETH.\n\nTL/DR List of commonly occurring issues in my dreary profession.",

        "text": "I've been in customer service in some aspect for 15 years. A good portion of that was spent working in Security for a rather well known Southern California attraction. Close to the end of my time there I had an experience which I feel wrapped up all the others in a pretty little bow. It was on a particularly hot day in the dead of Summer.\n\nWhile on standard patrol around the grounds a radio call comes in to our dispatch office from what had to be a volunteer.\n\nVolunteer: uh, hi, Security... we, uh, need someone to come over (giggling and snorting heard just over the sound of a crowd) here right away..\n\nDispatcher: 10-4. What is your location? What assistance do you need?\n\nVolunteer: Uh, we're uh, in the Sea Lion tunnel. Just, uh, send someone (more giggling in the background) right away.\n\nWe got these kinds of calls all the time during the Summer. More often than not it was a lost child or some sort of lost item that no one wanted to deal with. As the officer in charge for the day I radioed my dispatcher that I would respond to the call and high-tailed it over to the location. \n\nUpon approaching the area I could not find a staff member amongst the small crowd. I made my way through the people toward the exit of the tunnel, and twenty paces from the door the worst smell I have ever encountered hit me in the face like a sledge hammer on fire. I knew what it was but couldn't bring myself to look down at first. When I did I found a Paul Bunyan sized pile of shit in the middle of a crowded walk way. \n\nHaving worked in Security for as long as I had, I had seen a thing or two. Dirty diapers left in the most conspicuous of places. Toilets clogged with panties during proms. But, this, this was a man-sized pile of shit that someone had taken in a crowded place during the dead of Summer. I did the only thing I could do.\n\nMe: Dispatch, call Housekeeping. We need an emergency clean up..\n",

        "text": "Last summer, during the music festival season I was working at a reasonably large festival renowned for the large number of fence jumping attempts.  \n8pm rolled around and a pickup truck arrived to pick me up from my post and take me back to camp. I jumped in the front and the other 5 guys from my post piled in the flat bed back. We followed the perimeter with the 8 foot high steel fence on our left and a large dense woodland on our right. As we passed a lonely camping chair on the outskirts of the woodland I noticed someone had clearly left their post, I mentioned it to driver and we backed up. As we got level with the chair it was apparent there were bodies hunch over peering through the tree line. Driver shouted to the guys in the back to jump out and investigate, we remained in the vehicle to radio it in, drivers went to put a call to control but his radio gave the dreaded beeping which only meant one thing, low battery. No problem I thought, have my battery, so we switched. The call went in to control, another vehicle and a dog unit were sent our way.  \nWe waited out on the path to ensure no one crossed over to the fence and waited for backup to arrive. The dog unit showed up and I paired up with him, we went off round the side of the woodland and followed it all the way to the back were it opened to fields as far as the eye could see, we knew they had to still be inside the woodland.  It was getting dark and was too risky to try and wade through the forest with the dog so I went inside and he mirrored my movements just outside along a gravel path, this is were things started to go south.  \nThe outside path and inside path went off in different direction and we got seperated, I was now in the woods on my own and needed to get out ASAP for my own safety. I'm not a whimp but I'm also not going to be a hero for £10 an hour. I got outside of the woods and followed the long gravel path between the woods and a dense corn field which leads straight back to the fence line. I could hear people moving on my left inside the woods, I paused to work out their location, they were getting nearer and they were running. Someone came flying out from my left, leaped across the path and into the dense corn field on my right, the corn was roughly 8 foot high and was much too dense to see through which is why we had all been instructed not to enter the cornfield alone. Instinctively or possibly stupidly I gave chase, but it was no use, I couldn't see a thing so just ran straight hoping to meet on the other side.  \nMy foot got caught and I fell forward, hitting my knee on a large rock and tearing my trousers, I jumped up and continued running. Eventually I made it out the other side and could see the man running across an open field, about 100 yards ahead of me. I gave it all I had to chase this guy, I love a good chase and I pride myself in the fact I have never been outrun to this date. I caught him, grabbed his shoulders and pulled him to the ground. He was clearly exhausted and gave no resistance to me holding him on the ground but he was a big guy and I wasn't taking any chances, I know of people who have been caught out like this before. At this point I am roughly 200 metres away from the path we had started on and most likely, my nearest colleague. I pulled out my radio to call for assistance.  \n\n\nMe: Roadontheshow to control, urgent message...   \nThem: This is \"charity channel\" do you have the correct channel?  \nMe: Negative, ignore last, out.  \n\nI must have accidentally knocked the dial, I flicked it round to the correct channel and my radio began to beep, I remembered switching batteries with driver and I was now without a way to contact control. Never fear, I have a mobile. Of course we're all expecting me to have no signal, that wasn't the case, I had full coverage, excellent. Who to call, I went for my manager, he'd be able to help... voicemail. Next option, the dog handler, he's nearby and I know him personally, I rang the number.  \n\nMe: Hey, Dog Handler?  \nThem: No, this is Dog Handler2.  \nMe: Apologies, wrong number bye.  \n\n\nI'm stuck, no more phone numbers to try and no battery on my radio. I began shouting at the top of my lungs whilst vigorously flashing my torch in the general direction of my team, it felt like a lifetime, I must have shouted 20 times, I can't imagine what this breathless man face down in the dirt was thinking at the time.\n\nLike a mirage, a silhouette of a man with his dog appears in the distance, I let out the biggest sye of relief and signalled him over with my torched. As he got near I helped the guy up, walked him calmly to a vehicle and handed him over to the eviction team, my job was done.  \n\n\nTLDR: Finished work, spotted people trying to break in, tried to chase them, got lost, found someone, gave chase, got lost again, caught them whilst lost in the middle of a field, radio died and I ended up sitting on top of a man for much longer than I would have liked to.\n",

        "text": "So I used to work a Night shift at a fairly new condo complex 11pm - 7am nightly.\n\nThe site was like most others, the odd resident coming and going, the odd Bar goer stumbling in at around 2am after last call, nothing really out of the ordinary usually.\n\nNow the condo is a fairly new complex built within the last 5-7 years.  Until this was developed the entire area was all fields and farm land.\n\nNow, this is where it gets unusual.  Almost on a nightly basis odd things would be observed both on the CCTV cameras, and visually by the guards on duty. (Myself included multiple times)\n\nSeeing unusual things on the CCTV cameras, like \"orbs\" or unexplained stuff in video footage can usually be easily chalked up to a bug flying around the camera or the lens getting dirty from weather/dirt etc.\n\nAround 3-3:30 am on a regular basis these instances would happen.   2 of the most notable instances are:\n\nThe Old Swing Music:\n\nWith the building layout, the recycling and garbage facilities located on the main level floor are closest to a retirement home next door.  There are no residential units on the first floor of this building.  Just the building facilities, which are always closed and locked at this hour.\n3:15-3:20 comes around one morning and I hear old styled Swing music (Think 1920's era) coming from what sounded like the recycling room.  As I get up to investigate the origins of the noise, it is like someone is turning the volume control down on a stereo.  As I walked closer to what seemed to be the source of the music, it got fainter and fainter to hear, eventually leaving no sound whatsoever.\n\nThis same music had happened numerous times, each time with the same result.   I initially thought it was coming from the old folks home next door, but then realized as much as older people do tend to get up earlier than most, 3am is a little TOO early for seniors to be getting jiggy with it.  Also from the building exterior no noise was able to be heard.   I was never able to figure out the origins of the music.\n\nThe lady in the Victorian era dress.\nThis one (thankfuly) only happened to me once, but I also had 2 other night guards report the same person.\n\nOne night again around 3am time slot, I noticed something from the corner of my eye near the Lobby elevator.  Looking up from the security monitors it was a Woman in what appeared to me to be a very unusual dress.  Not unusual for its design or anything, but the fact this dress simply was not a dress someone of our time would be wearing, the dress itself appeared to be from like the 1800's  It was a red Victorian styled era dress, where the dress even covered the woman's neck.  At this point I more asked if there was anything I could do to help this lady, who in return appeared to walk around the corner to the elevator doors, to which I looked on the CCTV system to verify the lady was in fact accessing the elevators.   The only problem was the lady once leaving my eye sight, never appeared on the camera system, and when I went to investigate was unable to determine where this person went.  All the camera footage shows is myself talking to apparently nothing, then getting up and looking around an empty elevator bank.  TO this day, again I have no explanation for this event.  But have had multiple other coworkers report the same woman on the buildings grounds in various locations.\n\n- Before anyone assumes I was fatigued or hallucinating from lack of sleep, I worked the night shift for well over a year and was well adjusted to being up at those hours of the night.\n\n\\\\EDIT:\n\nAs noted in the topic title, I have just never been able to explain these occurrences.  I never chalked it up to a ghost, nor lost sleep in any way for either of these instances.  One co worker however was not so lucky, whatever he experienced one night shift troubled him so much he outright refused to return to the site.",

I've worked security since i was 19 years old, Police academy certified training. The Company i work for deals with a lot of rough areas involving Heavy gang activity and Drug transactions. We work a lot of Section 8 properties and deal with a lot of crap, make frequent detentions for felonies, and for our safety. I've been threatened death, Assaulted, even shot at one night. I have lots of stories.)\n\nOne night last Summer i was working a shift with my Captain. While on patrol (roughly 2 am.) We saw an African american male gathering up twigs, paper litter, leaves Across the street from us. This male then sat the pile of what he was gathering against the wall of an apartment building and proceeded to light it on fire. Myself and my Captain double time it across the street, make the attempted arsonist step back,and we then stomped out the small fire.\nThe suspect could barely stand, had bloodshot eyes, and smelled heavily of alcohol.\n\n\"Sir, What the hell do you think you're doing? You can't just start a fire wherever you want.\" I said. \nThe suspect looked me dead in the eyes and said \"Man....(He then gave the longest pause in the world. I'm talking ten seconds here.).....You ruined my Experiment. \" My captain and i were floored and honestly struggled not to laugh at him. My Captain stepped forward and said\n\"Sir, do you live here\"\n\"No.\" The suspect replied.\n\"Ok, You need to leave the property then. Goodbye, Have a nice day.\" My Captain said.\nThe suspect smacked his lips at us very disrespectfully and became somewhat agitated.\n\"You can't make me leave!\" He spat at us.\n\"Sir! Leave now, or you're going to get charged with criminal trespassing.\" I said.\n\nThe suspect scoffed and staggered off of our property and stood in the middle of the empty street, drunkenly defiant. He then proceeded to call his Lawyer and put his lawyer on speaker phone.\n\n(Swear to god)\n\nThe suspect says \"Hey Jimmy, I'm on private property and these guards are telling me to leave! Like How the fuck can they do that tho? Like for real? It's private property. They can't Make me leave! It isn't public!\"\n\nThere was a long long pause from the speaker phone before the lawyer spoke.\n\n\"Alan, It's two something in the morning. If the cops or whoever are telling you to get off of the property then you need to get off the property immediately. do it now.\" The lawyer then hung up the phone.\n\nThe attempted arsonist then looked at us, drunkenly smug and then said \"Yeah, that's right bitches!\" And then walked away into the night. Leaving myself and my Captain slack jawed by the amount of stupidity we had just absorbed in that short of time.\n(The end.)",

I said yes and explained that she needs to park at the front of the building and check in at the front desk since \"This lot is for employees and guest parking is at the front of the building.\" She said \"I'm a guest\" and then stared at me for a moment. So I just repeated that she needs to park at the front of the building. \n\nSo she got an attitude saying \"Well it used to be that you can come in and just go around the corner to the credit union. And now you want me to go somewhere else and walk all around when I'm only going to be here for a few minutes.\" \n\nShe showed me her card, which told me she was a retiree of the company so I told her that she can go ahead and park here but she still needs to go to the front desk and check in there. This is standard procedure anyway when the front lot's filled and since she had the card, I was okay with sending her on up to the front desk.\n\nThis is where I made a mistake. Still with an attitude, she asked where the credit union was. I should have just said the front desk guard would direct her to where she needs to go. Instead, I (forgetting that the actual branch is on the first floor) said there's offices on the third floor and told her she still needs to go to the front desk to check in though. Really, really stupid on my part. \n\nI called the front desk guard a few minutes after she got in the elevator and told her what happened in case she didn't go to the front desk. That way it wouldn't blow back on me too much. \n\nThe front desk guard called the 3rd floor and found out that the lady apparently had just gone on up to the fucking 3rd floor and was super rude to the people there and started chewing them out when they told her to go to the first floor. \n\nSo that bothered me since it makes us look bad and I allowed her to come through against normal protocol so she wouldn't be inconvenienced. Which I realize was a mistake on my part regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo needless to say, I'm not going to let that ever happen again. ",

We couldn't pull up any close so Paul got out and hopped the fence to have a chat with the man, Paul didn't get very close to the man before he made a sharp turn and headed straight back to the vehicle. I'll always remember the bemused look on his face when he explained to us what he had just seen, so this hippy looking man, sat under the pyramid was  inside a circle of candles, next to a pile of his clothes... pleasuring himself. When confronted he responded \"I'm putting the energy back into the earth\". Instantly rumours spread across the site of a mysterious man, better known as the Druid with fluid.",

Throughout the night, people get ejected for various reasons, this one individual gets ejected because he's intoxicated and keeps trying to get bartenders to serve him more. He got kicked out, tried to come back, got kicked out again. So we walk him to the door, shove him in a taxi, tell him that he really should just go home and bid him good night.\n\nBout 20 minutes later our boss calls us to a part of the building that isn't related to the rave and is therefore closed for the night. Same guy was down there trying to pry open doors (with his bare hands). My partner and I go down there, I lecture him a bit, telling him that he's already got kicked out, and he was lucky enough not to be banned. I tell him to get off property and If we see him again tonight, we're going to arrest him.\n\nHe seems to understand, agrees, shakes my hand, and then walks down the street. We slowly follow, just making sure he actually leaves the property. Suddenly he turns and starts walking up to the building again. He's a pretty good distance away from us at this point, having almost left the property. I start running over to him, and he takes off, darts into some bushes beside the building. The bushes are on a hill that is quite steep, and the bushes are very thick with thistle and other pokey things. After another 20 minutes of searching, my partner and I decide we probably missed him going out and back down to the road, since unless he was calmly laying in hiding in the bushes he would have been spotted by now. he was too drunk to scale that hill. We call it quits and go back inside.\n\nA short time later, my partner steps out one of the entrances and round a corner to have a smoke. Then he radios me \"yugo, get your ass over here\"\n\nDude from earlier crawled out of the bushes onto the staircase/patio areas on the side of the building and was slowly sneaking his way back up to the main entrance. My partner runs down the stairs, I come out an emergency exit right beside the guy. He contemplates running for a moment, but he then gives up because the only way to escape us was back into the bush. We uneventfully arrest him. Dude is COVERED in scratches and bits of thistle and whatnot. I ask the guy if he wants to see the medics, he says no, now he just wants to go home.\n\nI search for his ID, He's got none on him. He's got a fat wad of cash on him though. A cop comes over, and we issue the guy a ban notice. cop gives him a trespassing ticket. And then we give the guy a choice, we shove him in a cab and he actually goes home this time, or he goes to jail tonight. He opts to go home",

        "text": "The company I work for is contracted to an office building. There are numerous security stations in this building and mine is at the entrance on top of the parking garage. \n\nMy job is to monitor the people entering and exiting the building, check for IDs and distribute temporary badges. That's pretty much it. After about 9am, there isn't much for me to do except stare at the parking lot until I take my lunch break.\n\nLast week, I was browsing reddit during a lull. There was no one around except for the 6 or 7 construction workers working outside my entrance. I heard a loud clatter and looked out my windows. My desk is surrounded by windows but with frames, glares and various structures outside, I don't have a full view of the parking deck. There are a couple significant blind spots. \n\nWhat I saw was the construction workers moving around outside the entrance and no body else. They moved their ladder around and I heard the noise again. So it was clear the noise I originally heard was the ladder. So I went back to reddit. \n\nLess than 40 seconds after I took my attention off of the windows, one of the employees swipes her badge and limps in. All she says is \"You must be reading something good because I just fell out there.\"\n\nShe said it with such a shitty and weirdly accusatory tone that I was caught off guard. I asked her if she was okay and she sort of scoffed and said yes. When she passed my desk I turned around and offered to get her ice and she said she was fine, in a clearly annoyed tone. \n\nSince that day, I've seen her entering/exiting the building a handful of times and each time she appears to consciously avoid eye contact and refuses to acknowledge my presence at all. \n\nThe way I see it, unless she fell directly in front of the doors or along the parking spaces to the left and right of the entrance, I wasn't going to have a clue that she'd fallen. \n\nAnd maybe I'm an asshole but if she fell and got back up within the 40 seconds my attention wasn't on the windows, then it would have barely given me time to react and go outside to make sure she was okay anyway. And whatever the circumstances were, it didn't call the attention of the half dozen construction workers who were closer to her and had better vantage points than I do. \n\nThe whole thing has bugged the shit out of me. She didn't report falling outside and she didn't say anything to the facilities team or my manager but I feel like she somehow thinks it's my fault that she fell down outside. It's annoying.",

        "text": "I work for an office building of mostly IT. Access control is my primary job but most days I'm just a jumped up front desk secretary. A *bad* one at that since us contracted security aren't privy to 90% of whats actually going on inside the office. \"No I don't know which room [Big Meeting] is being held and no I don't have access to a list of people running it\" kinda thing. \n\nThat mess is usually no problem. I can pass the buck to HR or the office admin, but now I might be sitting on a live grenade I have nowhere to throw. The employees here have finally, collectively, learned that they can completely bypass ALL of the access control rules and are no longer shy about doing so.\n\nOut of the buildings four entrances (all of which need an access card to open) my desk is completely isolated from the other three. Piggybacking and door holding has become the norm and recently employees are sneaking in guests and deliveries with increasing frequency. They fib and claim ignorance of the rules when I catch them red handed. Maybe they don't like \"Big Brother\" watching them or perhaps they don't like the hassle of a middle man. Either way it puts me in the hot seat.\n\nAs an \"outsider\" I don't have the power to scold them and the office management (guilty of this behavior themselves) wont punish. I'd bring this to *my* managements attention, but ignoring that I'd be admitting to not doing my job, they wouldn't dare risk upsetting our employers one way or the other. I'd be thrown under the bus and nothing would change. It sounds so very stupid but that's how things have been run on my account for the few years I've been here. \n\nCaught between the ol' rock and a hard place, my only option is to keep quiet and hope this never blows up. So you could say that I'm dealing with a lot of insecurity lately.  ",

My shift begins at 1500. It was not a last minutes call out or anything, they have known all day that the person on third shift quit. They never gave me any heads up so that I could bring coffee or mountain dew or anything. This is not the first time this has happened before. When I tried telling my supervisor that I couldn't as I had plans, he said that he didn't want to hear it and that I could call his boss. \n\nI would have exepct this boss considers telling him no as insubordination and will remove people from the contract.

        "text": "So the hospital I worked at had a very busy Emergency Room like most are. I was working as the Shift Lead During this Friday night, were our volume had been so high seating was non existent and people were sitting on benches outside. One of our regular pain med seekers came in as I was making rounds through the ER. He had just checked in with the front desk as I was walking out the front door to return to the Security Office to finish a report. \n\nI'm in the Security Office for 5-10 mins before I hear someone screaming outside. I go outside and begin to look around for the commotion be don't see anything. I start towards the parking garage where I find a man laying supine near the stairwell not responding to my shouting  (I think to myself damn it I'm not even finished with my first report). I start BLS first aid on the guy and checking for a pulse. He had a pulse and was breathing he was just passed out. I attempt to follow proper protocol and dial the in house emergency number but the spectralink phone isn't getting reception. I call the ER officer to get medical staff that I have someone down over the radio. \n\nThe ER Officer responds to my location with a ER Tech.  The Tech takes over and starts BLS where I left off and gives the individual a sternal rub and the individual comes to. He crys to the Tech he fell from the stairs and his ankle is killing him. The Tech calls the ER Charge Nurse comes out pushing a gurney. He gets taken in as a Trauma via the Ambulance Bay. We all meet in the trauma room, when the Patient Advocate shows up and asks me what happened. I explain where I found him and what he said happened. The Patient Advocate says that's funny he signed in 15 mins ago looking for a pain med refill and didn't like the 3 hour wait and left. \n\nWe figure he jumped off the stairs half way between the 1st floor and 2nd and hurt himself landing on the ground. I talked to him about it and he claimed he accidentally went over the side chasing a cigarette. I press him on the issue he had no car parked in the garage and had no real reason to be there. I end up trying to finishing his report at the front ER Desk while relieving the ER Officer when my jumper got discharged. The Trauma Nurse looks to me and said we called him a taxicab because he has no other way home make sure he doesn't steal our wheelchair. \n\nI go outside as he is trying to get into the cab. He asks for help so I get the cab door, he wanted me to pick him up. I explain that patient care is outside my scope of practice and I was just here to get the wheelchair. He asks me,  \"how do you think I'm  going to get in the cab, walk in? I told him he would have to figure out how to get in he did it with a 3 hour wait (looking back this might have been a real dick move but he was an a$$hole to staff while he was there in the ER when I was making rounds so I wasn't going to go out of my way for him). \n\nHe gets up out of the chair and crawls into the cab. He complained to me that they didn't give him \"real\" pain medication in the back when he first came in until the doctor seen him. He said he had two broken ankles and they wouldn't send him home with narcotics that he needed. They told him to see his primary care physician for that.  I told him sorry to hear that  and have a nice night and closed the door. \n\ntl;dr\nBe me working at a hospital. Guy comes into ER for narcotic pain killers. Doesn't want to wait 3 hrs to be seen and leaves. While writing a report hear a scream look for what caused it find him passed out from jumping off stairs of parking garage. He breaks Ankles from fall and is seen right away. Staff doesn't give him his way and treats him following all protocols which he feels delays his pain meds. Me being uncaring jerk doesn't help him either and watch him leave hospital crawling into cab with a prescription for ibuprofen. \n",

        "text": "My first job in security was as the overnight transport officer for a privately operated halfway house. From midnight till 8am I'd take the inmates to work and pick them up after, occasionally stopping for coffee, catnaps, and the odd drive thru run for my LT. and Dispatcher.   \n\nOne Monday night, I'm clocking in and checking out the van keys when  an inmate we'll call the Crackhead-Man [CHM for short] arrives on his bicycle and stumbles in trying to explain to me why he's 4 hours late coming back.  Policy at our facility is that if you're more than 30 minutes late back from your work-site and you don't call ahead, you are automatically whiz-quizzed and if you fail, you get sent back up the ladder to a higher security facility [e.g. \"real jail\"]. I just held up a hand to stop him and said \"tell it to the LT, my man. Four hours late makes it her problem\".  He shuffled over to the LTs desk and I left for my next drop-off.    \nWhile I'm out, I got a call from the LT to let me know that the local PD would be picking up CHM and taking him to his new [higher security] home before the end of the shift. Big shocker there...  \nWhen I returned about an hour later, I stopped by the holding area to check on CHM and noticed he wasn't on the couch. [The only furniture in the room] As I was passing through the main office, I asked the LT if PD had picked up CHM already. The exchange went something like this:  \n\nMe: PD must be having a slow night, hunh, boss?  \n\nLT: What are you talking about, 6?  \n\nMe: Well, they already picked up CHM, so I figured-  \n\nLT: Say what?   \n\nMe: Sorry, boss. I thought you'd stuck him in holding, what, did you send him back to his dorm? He can't *possibly* have pissed clean...  \n\nLT: *Duh*.  \n\nMe: So if he's not in the dorm and PD didn't come get him... \n \nLT: Oshit.   \n\n[I'm gonna pause here for a second and describe my LT. I love this lady, but pretty ain't in it. Picture Santa as a morbidly obese lesbian and you've pretty much got it. Moving on...]  \n\nLT heaved herself out of her chair said \"call the dorm officer and have him check CHMs room, just in case. You hop in the van and do a loop, see if you see him on foot, I'll check holding again just in case he's hiding [something he actually did have a history of doing] under the couch or something.\"   \nAt this point we're thinking he can't have gotten very far, he's shackled at the wrists and ankles after all.   \nLittle did we know....  \n\nI left and did my loop of the facility [no joy], the dorm officer checked in - no luck there either, but he noticed that CHMs bike was gone also.  The LT. and I were mulling that rather odd fact over when a police cruiser pulled up out front.     \n\nGuess who's in the back seat?   \n\nYup, our friendly neighborhood Crackhead-Man.  \n\nAs nearly as i can figure, it must have gone down something like this: LT. piss-tests CHM, he fails [duh], LT shackles CHM as is procedure and puts him in the holding room just off the main office. CHM waits untill LT is caught up in paperwork or a call from the Dorm Officer or something, then calmly stands up and walks right out the door, through the office and out to the parking lot [where his bike was still parked, but not chained to the rack]. He hopped on his bicycle and some how ***still cuffed at the wrists and ankles*** makes it *two and a half miles* before he falls off the bike and hits his head.  PD said they found him sitting on the curb, holding his head and bleeding. They weren't even looking for a fugitive at that point, they thought they were helping out a cyclist in distress....until they saw the cuffs, then [according to the officers that found him] the older of the two cops just smiled and said, \"hey, buddy....I think I know someone who's looking for you....\"    \nLT took one look and told PD \"we don't want him, he's all yours, fellas.\"  \nAnd thus endeth the Crackhead's tale...\n  \nTL;DR - Yeah, it's *possible* to bike in cuffs and shackles, but it sure isn't recommended.....",

Its why MC agreed to his demotion\"\n\nI slightly feigned surprise. \n\n&gt;Me:\"Wait...demotion? MC's getting demoted?\"\n\nSS picks up on my bullshit, smiles a bit\n\n&gt;SS:\"He had a meeting with the companies owner [small security company], and agreed that being a Shift Super wasn't in it for him.\"\n\n&gt;TSG:\"That's...the least of it anyway.

I knew his situation well enough. \n\nI'll wrap this up in a later story. Thank you all for your eyes. :) ",

        "text": "This is the story of possibly the funniest thing I've seen an arrested person do.\n\nAfter building lockup, myself and another security agent were chatting, walking around checking doors and stuff. A third agent was a floor above us in the office. A couple temporary contract guards (we use \"agent\" and \"guard\" to differentiate between our roles and training level) were patrolling the outside of the building as there is an active construction site out there. They only have a keycard for a staff door to use the bathroom, they can't open the front doors, which are locked as the building is closed.\n\nThe contract guards outside radio us saying that just inside the main doors, there are three guys who somehow got into the building and are wading in our water fountain gathering up coins. The two of us downstairs start running up there, but we are beat to the entrance by the agent who was in the office. He gets up there and announces that all three of these idiots are under arrest.  \n\nOk, I woulda just banned them and kicked them out, but fuck it I guess we're arresting them.\n\nSo we uneventfully arrest them, slap the cuffs on, read them their rights etc. Call the police, wait for police arrive.\n\nApparently the police in the area were dealing with multiple serious incidents, so we are sitting on this arrest for several hours. Thanks a lot (name of idiot agent who beat us up here)\n\nAnyway, all three of these guys are drunk but largely cooperative. Couple hours in one of them starts to get hungry.\n\nhim: \"man Im hungry\"  \ncoworker: \"are you diabetic?\"   \nhim: \"no im just fuckin hungry\"   \ncoworker: \"ok well I'm not taking the cuffs off until the cops get here\"   \nhim: *indicates bag of skittles he has sitting open next to him* \"can i eat my skittles\"   \ncoworker: \"well I aint takin the cuffs off\"   \nhim: \"that's ok I got this\"    \n\nDude then proceeds to flop over on his side and shove his whole face in the bag of skittles, scooping up a bunch and getting a whole bunch of skittles stuck to the side of his face. He did this several times. Even hours later when he was released by police, he walked out the door with skittles stuck to his face. Didn't even bother to wipe them off.",

To the point where, to the disbelief of me and TSG, MC was...\n\n*Conversation inside the guard shack while SS was reaming MC behind it, we could barely hear and see the conversation as it unfolded, but we could clearly hear one thing*\n\n&gt;TSG:\"Is he...fucking crying?\"\n\n&gt;Me:\"I do believe that is the sobbing of a broken man, yes.\"\n\n&gt;TSG:\"Seriously. I took my ass chewing like a fucking adult.\"\n\n&gt;Me:\"Don't know what to tell you. By the way, no hard feelings right? You know damn well I would be under the bus with you two on this one.\"\n\n&gt;TSG:*brofist* \"I know what I screw up, man. I really screwed up this time, I'm sorry for trying to have you go along with that. It was stupid. I'm man enough to admit that. I still can't believe MC's crying though...\"\n\n&gt;Me:\"Its MC dude. He's literally mentally stuck at the age of 9 trying to work his way around adult life at the age of [20's]\"\n\n&gt;TSG:\"Didn't even think he was that bad to be honest. Is what it is. Oh hey, someone's at the gate...\"\n\nI run outside and address the gate, meanwhile making sure to keep a sharp ear out for what SS was saying. I heard less of SS at this point and more of MC's sobbing. Almost made me feel...sad. \n\nSS then came inside the shack.\n\n&gt;SS:\"MC, gate duty, I have to brief these two\"\n\n&gt;MC:\"Ye...yes sir\"\n\nWe talk inside. With SS pretty much telling us that MC is on his last leg as a Shift Super. I was asked again to keep a and I quote \"Hawk Eye\" on MC's actions. \n\nAnd then a week or two later, things go right to shit. Its like there's a schedule for these sorts of things... \n\n...ahh I'm not going to be that guy and leave you guys hanging. \n\n**A WILD CITY OF HURR POLICE CAR APPEARS AT THE GATE!**\n\n**MC USED \"SPEAK TO OFFICER\"**\n\n**IT WASN'T VERY EFFECTIVE**\n\n**OFFICER USED \"VOICE OF AUTHORITY\"**\n\n**ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE!**\n\nSo MC just let two police cars on the premise to do what ever they want to on the property. Without calling anyone inside the plant. Without calling SS prior. (Which is procedure. We MUST speak to our site super prior to letting any cops on the premise. I would imagine that standard fair for just about every other damn security company that deals with property security). The police cars literally zoomed off to the rear of the plant...\n\n...annnnnnnnnnnnd I make a phone call after having a HEATED argument with MC about how he just broke major rules. \"SS WILL BE FINE WITH IT.\"\n\nLets see how fine with it SS was...\n\n&gt;SS (over the phone):\"**MC DID FUCKING WHAT?!?!**\"\n\nLoud enough that I could see MC's knees start to quiver a bit. \n\n&gt;SS:\"Hand the phone over to MC. I can't fucking believe this.\"\n\nI could almost hear everything SS said he was so loud. You could *FEEL* the rage through the phone. Eventually the cops left, they were apparently investigating a 911 dial-and-hangup from inside the plant. \n\nFucking still...\n\nI shall leave the aftermath for the next story. At least, giving me enough time to formulate it properly in my head. I'm glad some of you are enjoying this, so I'll keep doing it. :)\n",

        "text": "This happened at the same site as my last post, but a few months ago. The shifts worked differently then, and because of that I would occasionally get put on 12 hour shifts overnight, really just being on site to try and make sure nobody got in through the doorless doorways and messed with the equipment on site.\n\nThis was one such night. On this shift, I was just sitting at the front of the building most of the night, watching Parks and Recreation on my laptop and watching to see if anyone walked on site. Every so often I'd patrol a bit, and if I ever heard a noise I'd pause the show and listen more. Of course, I'd have seen if anybody walked on site: I could see both of the gates from where I was sitting, and there's no other way onto the site. Sometimes I'd see a skunk that lived on site (quite friendly, for a skunk. Just hid away from me if it ever saw me and waited for me to leave) and I saw a raccoon crawl out of the joint between two of the buildings, look at me, and then slowly back into the wall again once.\n\nSo, I'm sitting there watching, and all of a sudden I hear music. This freaks me out a bit, but whatever, I should probably go try to find it. I walk around the floor near where I am, and I can't find it. I go upstairs and I can't find it. I go down to the basement, and there's a big open room, unfinished, where the workers are storing a lot of materials and equipment.\n\nOne of the pieces of equipment is a radio that had an alarm set. I unplug it, take a breath, and continue with my night.",

Time for another rousing adventure in to the relm of The Manchild.\n\nThe time I really got to understand everyone's distaste of MC was after I completed my transfer to swing shift, and ended up working with MC. Unfortunately, I got the absolute brunt of his brutally childish behavior and mentality when he....he...\n\n...got a goddamn promotion. \n\nIt was only a month and a half before I moved to the swing shift at this plant, and he had achieved \"Shift Supervisor\" status because of the squrrially way our company went about giving promotions. This happened *REGARDLESS* of the site supervisor's objections. Whats even more frighting, is that we had long joked this would never happen. \n\nI have long since decided to not par-take in those kinds of jokes. Karma came around and smacked me on this one. \n\nSuffice to say (and initially surprising to everyone else) MC performed rather decently for the first few months as Shift Super. And then my transfer happened, and it threw a few wrenches in to MC's ways. \n\nUnfortunately for MC, I wasn't a push over. And, I had always, -always- reported to the Site Super before. It was requested of me that I continue to do the same, but for the time being \"Play ball\" with MC. \"Let him make his own bed, he will.\"\n\nSo he did. \n\nMC had a habit of arguing with me over what should and shouldn't happen on site, and how things were going to run under his shift. Unfortunately, many of his ideas directly conflicted with what SS had already set up 3 years previously as procedure (many of that was still relevant). It got to the point where MC and I would occasionally have yelling matches, and I'd be doing an almost daily report to SS on what MC did that day. This was going beyond dramafest right to critical mass. I found myself right in the middle of it. Because, I cared for my job. \n\nA couple of procedures that MC and I had multiple arguments over were the admittance of various semi deliveries. Specific types of deliveries we had to adhere to very specific rules on, others we just had to call in to the cold docks and let them know someone was here. Whenever we had an empty reefer come on to the lot with a lower than required fuel level, we were required to force the driver to drive off lot and fuel up. MC failed to do this several times which ended up in arguments between the two of us. \n\nThen there were the arguments of who to call when to let guests in. MC INSISTED on calling the Plant Safety Manager for issues that he had nothing to do with. This was also a guy who was heavy no-bullshit. So if you're talking to him when you shouldn't be, he's going to call your ass on it and then give SS a call. \n\nWhat really compounded the negative nature of my relationship with MC was his absolute distaste in doing any goddamn work. He had power now, so he could tell others to do work. I ended up doing a lot of ass-busting because of him and he ended up doing a lot of ass-sitting. Whenever there was work to be done, he'd tell me to do it and fucking laugh in an almost mocking tone. *That shit doesn't fly with me* \n\nMC and I had two talks before his reign of terror ended, both were loud, LOUD yelling matches with no one around to witness them besides our Turnstile Guard who was assisting us after the Turnstile closed (he had a two hour over lap). TSG was always a fan of not getting involved in these arguments I'd have with MC. Until the second argument happened where MC was claiming he did the majority of the work, which prompted snickering out of TSG and myself. Promptly followed up with TSG asking MC if he was delusional or just didn't realize that everyone else sees him sit on his ass doing nothing. \n\nAfter the second argument I called SS immediately and appraised him of the situation. The very next day SS decided to have a meeting between me and MC, with a discussion with TSG when he came in. MC tried to state that he did the lions share of the work, but I wasn't having that. It probably helped I gave detailed descriptions of what I saw him doing in the guard shack while I was out in the elements directing traffic. SS wasn't too pleased about this. MC earned himself a bit of time outside of the shack for a month and a half anytime SS was on site. I was also informed by SS that any time MC tried to tell me to do work, I was to reply \"You can't do it why?\" every time. \n\nBosses orders, right? Saying that felt way, way too good. And I got to say it a LOT. \n\nAfter all these procedural deviations and abuse of personnel, MC's position ended up on thin ice with the company.  Even more so when he made up a huge, HUGE lie to SS about one of our Turnstile Guards time of leaving. MC allowed this Turnstile Guard to leave early -without- premission from SS. This is major, major no-no. Not only did MC do this, but he lied right to SS on the phone. \n\n&gt;SS:\"Hand the phone over to FB\"\n\n&gt;MC:*grumbles*\n\n&gt;Me:\"Whats up, SS?\" (we were on some pretty lax terms) \n\n&gt;SS:\"Did the Turnstyle Guard for today leave at [time]\"\n\n&gt;Me:\"Mm, No. MC allowed him to leave 10 minutes earlier than that because of [reason]\"\n\n&gt;SS:\"Thank you for being honest.\"\n\n&gt;Me:\"Any time.\" \n\nI didn't know a phone speaker could get that loud after I handed the phone back. \n\nMC and the TSG eventually got the ass chewing of their lives and TSG BARELY got out of a write up since MC was the one to approve it. MC wasn't so lucky in that regard. \n\nThat's all for Part III this time around. Part IV is going to be some major, major shit going down. So stay tuned! ",

        "text": "So as a little background to this story, I used to be a Public Safety Officer in a mall. Yes I know Paul Blart been there done that now we can move on. So as a little insight into this story, the client who owned the property had an insanely strict code of conduct policy. A lot of the time, these COC violations fell upon us to use our better judgment to resolve the situation appropriately. \n\nIf any of you guys have ever worked in an environment like that it leads to a ton of face time with customers at all times. So this particular incident happened in July of 2014. I was as a green as they come in the field and I had just finished my introductory training. At this point I was on my own and no more FTO stalking me through the property. \n\nSo I'm out in the truck just chillen in one of the parking lots listening to the radio and doing my thing. Early in the shift, my partner and one of the officers had gotten into contact with a group of girls for just regular COC crap, (Sitting on the walls by the entrances) when they had eventually started to make a scene and my partner kicked them off property for the day.\n\n Pretty average day we used to get about 3 or 4 of those incidents a shift and it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Well I decided to go ride around and get some air moving in my car because the AC was broken and just happened upon the girls that had previously been asked to leave. So I stopped and just asked them to come over politely and asked them what was going on. If I recall correctly the events proceeded like this:\n\n\"How's it going today ladies?\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"Well I was listening to my radio a little while ago and heard that a group of girls matching your description was asked to leave the property.\"\n\n\"Hey we're not hurting nobody we're just sitting here.\" \n\n\"Yeah I get that, but my partner asked you to leave, and she wouldn't have without a good reason. That being said I need you and your friends to be leaving or we're gonna have a problem.\"\n\n(At this point my partner and another new officer come walking out of the door) \n\n\"Alright I told you once stand your asses up and walk the fuck off the property. If you don't you'll be charged with criminal trespass by the sheriff's office.\"\n\nSo this bickering between my partner and one of the girls goes on for about another 30 seconds or so. At this point I'm out of the car and standing to the side of the girl in question. Honestly I wanted her to take a swing, and I thought it was gonna happen, but these next ten seconds, oh my god these seconds are burned into my brain forever. \n\nMy partner: \"Alright I'm gonna go ahead and call a Code 8 (Call the cops).\"\n\nThe Girl:\" YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK THIS BULLSHIT! Y'ALL NEED TO GO GET SOME DICK ESPECIALLY YOU, YOU OLD CUNT!\"\n\nShe screams this in my partners face and I had to do everything in my power to not start laughing. I have never in my life, seen the OC spray almost come out for no good reason, but that nearly did it, I thought my partner was gonna go for it. So the girl backs down, and walks up out of the lot and off property.\n\n My partner calls us Code 4 and heads back inside. The other officer comes up to me we look each other in the eyes for probably less than a second, and just burst out laughing. I mean I thought I was gonna have heart failure I was laughing so hard. From that day on, and even now into the present day I have barely ever laughed that hard ever. I mean ever.\n\nAfter the all clear sounded, I went to finish the last 20 or so minutes of my exterior patrol. I go to drive around the perimeter road (Ring Road), and the song It was a Good Day by Ice Cube started playing in the car. That was the day I realized I was cut out for that job.",

        "text": "April of 2014. It was a fairly quiet day at my old job. I was working as a patrolman for a local security company. It usually just consists of driving from apartment complex to complex, locking up laundry rooms, pool gates, etc. I was still fairly new, so my FTO was riding with me at the time.\n\nAround 2300, we arrive at our second apartment complex. We are responsible for making sure nobody is in the pool when we lock up. When we walked up to the gates, we saw a group of 10-12 college aged kids just patrying at the pool. They were all fairly intoxicated, just having a fun time. If it was one of my days off, I would probably have been on the other side of the gate, having fun myself!\n\nI approached the gate and acknowledged them. I said something like \"hey guys! Sorry to break up the fun, but I have to lock up and whatnot. I need you all to hop out of the pool\". Most of them were perfectly fine with that... Except for one.\n\nHe shouted back, \"fuck you. I'll get out whenever the fuck I feel like it.\"\n\nWell, that was rude. His friends thought it was rude as well, saying things like \"John, shut the fuck up. He's just doing his job. Get out of the pool.\"\n\nIt went back and forth for a few minutes, between him yelling profanities at us, his friends begging him to just get out so they could leave, and us stating leave or we'll call the cops. John finally decides he's had enough and hops out... Only to start walking towards the gate. He opens the gate and gets too close for my comfort. I tell him to back up, as does my FTO. He runs back into the pool area. He grabs what looks like his towel and puts on his shoes. He walks back directly towards us and reveals he's carrying a heavy maglite flashlight. We immediately retreat back behind out patrol car and pull out our batons. My FTO radios our dispatch and tells them to send the police. All the while, John's friends are holding him back, telling him he's being stupid, leave us alone, etc.\n\nJohn is not having any of it. He charges me. I continue retreating around the patrol car, not wanting to get hit. He comes around the corner of the front left of the car and takes a swing at me. I jump back and my FTO goes to the other side of him. We have him between us. He turns around and smashes the flashlight into our windshield. The first hit doesn't do much, the second cracks the windshield.\n\nHis friends are yelling, we're yelling, he's yelling, it's just a mess. He turns toward my FTO and charges at him. I use the opportunity to charge him. I grab his arm and pull it as hard as I can to get the weapon away from him. I guess I pulled a little too hard, because the flashlight flew out of his hands, spun and went straight through the back of our cars' back window. It then bounced around inside and cracked the back left window as well.\n\nWe take John to the ground and put him in handcuffs. His friends start approaching us... It's 2 on 11 right now, we're seriously in trouble. Thankfully, they weren't angry at us at all... In fact, they wanted to help. One of them assisted in holding this guy down, while the others called the cops as well.\n\nP.D. finally arrives and takes him into custody. They take our statements, his, the friends, etc. They take him off to the drunk tank for the night and everyone goes back home. My FTO and I have to get the car towed back to the station and we were told to call it a night.\n\nThe next day, when I returned to work, there was the flashlight. It was proudly displayed on our wall at work, next to all of the other seemingly random pieces of things our boss had collected. We all had a laugh. Our boss then lectured us on how dangerous that whole situation was, try not to get into that again, etc. We all agreed we were lucky.\n\nI ended up quitting that job a few weeks later. I went back to fighting fires for the fire season. I still wonder if that flashlight is up on that wall still, and if the boss still tells new people about it.",

The original post was that of a retail worker getting hit by a bag of bagels seemingly from nowhere. This was my comment:\n\n\nI have a very unfortunate colleague. As security guards, we see a lot of crazy shit but this guy just seems to take it to the next level all the time. I'm pretty sure he invaded Poland in his last life or something and that karma is only now catching up to him. I wish I could tell you all the stories but I'll settle for the time he was attacked by a ghost.\n\n\nIn the city where I live, we have some old buildings that are known for being haunted. Most of the time we don't get that vibe, although I don't recommend watching horror movies before starting your night watch. One of these buildings is an old theatre where a former actress is said to haunt the balcony. So this colleague of mine is making rounds with another colleague. Checking that doors are locked are kind of second nature to us, so one of them walks across the room to check the door at the other end while talking, while my unlucky/lazy colleague stays put... below the balcony. Now, The Perfumed Lady is said to be a benign ghost but I doubt he felt that way when a pair of scissors flew from a nearby table with the pointy end in front, graced his thigh, hit the wall behind him and finally lay to rest on the ground. He never set foot in there again.\n\n\nNone of these two works there any more, nor do I, but I hear that other guards tell stories about mysterious events that takes place there. Lights flickering, the sound of footsteps getting closer, the smell of perfume...\n\n\nLet's hear some ghost stories guys!\n",

The only way to increase your paycheck is by actually getting promoted to a higher position. \n\nI work really hard doing extra paperwork, picking up shifts, staying over, and things that are above what I am required. When discusssing with my manager if I would be elligible for a promotion, he told me absolutelly not. \n\nWhen I asked why he told me that the client's associates thought I always looked mad and unfriendly. He said that I never try and talk to the associates. I responded that I always try and talk to them but ,seeing as how the only real intereaction is when they have to return temporary badges and they are ready to throw them on my desk and keep walking, they never seem to want to even respond with a simple greeting. My supervisor told me that it was my fault they werent talking to me and they thought I was unfriendly. \n\nIs it right to base raises or promotions on peoples perceptions, rather than actual merit.  \n\nThere are guards that don't do a single thing and they are thought to be the friendliest people, but they don't actually do their job. While I bust it and cover the slack and I get put down. What should I do ",

I'm only there on the weekends, since I have school, so I don't always know what's going on, but because of the way the shifts work I tend to know generally what's happening.\n\nA month and a half or so ago, one of the guards I relieve in the mornings told me about the new shifts they have during the week. Turns out that one floor of the building was locked down, and the only way in or out was signing in with security. I wasn't aware of the extent of this until three weeks ago, when I was told by the guy we (sort of) report to to patrol the building since there were two of us at the gate. So I go and patrol the building, and when I get to the floor that was locked down I see the extent of it: there is literally no access without having an access card, which we didn't have. Then I see the schedules posted on when they're locking down the rest of the building. The client wants us patrolling checking for water leaks and such, so I talked to the guy we report to and asked him if we could get access cards. He said he'd talk to the super.\n\nFast forward a week, and I ask him what the super said. He tells me the super said no. On Friday, I relay the situation to HQ so they're aware (I would have earlier, but there are... communication issues here).\n\nThen Saturday, I'm working the gate and the one guy who I talk to on site comes in. I told him last week about this ridiculous situation, so he tells me this week that the guards on Friday night had an access card. I call up the guy we report to, he tells me that yes, we do have cards now. A week ago the client refused to give us access, and now suddenly we have it.\n\nClients can make some strange decisions.",

        "text": "So: today's been fun so far. \n\n0800 start at the Hotel for my second day of DayShift in a decade and the fun began almost immediately. Around 0830 got a callout from the DM to remove a vagrant from the lobby. Pretty standard fare for a morning shift so far. Approach the bloke, all easy peasey lemon squeezy like, an immediately note that the guy is filthy (vagrant confirmed) with a huge egg on his forehead that's only formed within a few hours, already patched up by the look of it with a split in the middle. \n\nWithout prompting he starts the convo; \n\n'I know, I know: I'll leave in a sec just counting my money.' Pulls a bunch of fiftys from his pocket. \n\n'Very well sir, but If you are not a guest at the hotel you will have to leave as soon as you do finish please.' \n\n'Fuck off.' He mutters. Here we go. \n\n'No need for that sir, just doing my job.' I noticed he had finished counting. 'Door's this way sir.' Motion him to follow. \n\n'Not finished,' he slurs, 'piss off idiot.' I'm still smiling, internally cursing the bloke out. \n\n'Its pretty simple sir; if you are not a guest or staff here, you need to leave. Door's this way sir.' I motion again. \n\n'I ain't going anywhere til I'm ready.' *sigh* After 5 minutes of this banter bouncing back and forth I stoop over a bit, drop my voice down a touch with a hint of 'this is getting annoying' in my tone. \n\n'Chief, perhaps you are confused with that head wound of yours. I am not requesting you to leave, I'm *telling* you to leave. Now; Door. This way.' \n\nHe starts slagging me off, calling me pissweak, saying he could flog me easily (we are actually about the same size, I had noticed) and stands up. Takes a step towards me. I glance down. His hand is clenched, has his lighter in it to bolster the punch he was gunna throw. I smile again. Gotcha. \n\nI take a quick step forward and put all of my momentum into a double handed sternum push. Not strike, push. He splays out, lands on his back and skids a bit on the polished marble. I've walked around him and grabbed him in a Fish Hook (combo rear naked choke and half Nelson) and lifted him from his now sitting position, carrying him 10 metres or so out the door. Hissed in his ear 'That was stupid wasn't it? Now piss off or we get the cops down here.' I release him and give him a push to create some distance. I turn around to walk back inside, only for him to come at me again. Saw it in the door reflection. I've spun around, spun *him* around into a proper choke, held him til I heard the gurgle and pushed him away. Didn't say a word this time. He didn't try and follow me back in again either. \n\nReturn inside, DM has already called the cops, so I return to post, telling the DM to radio if he or the cops walk in. So I return to the gaming room, sit down and try to write the incident report whilst shaking from the Adrenaline. Got a paragraph in when I heard a few raised voices coming from the bank of machines to my left. Off I go again. \n\nAn older Greek fella and an equally aged woman were arguing. A staff member informed me she had complained as he was slapping the buttons (which admittedly can get annoying) and when she asked him to settle down he's told her where to go. \n\nI've politely asked him to ease up as well too keep the peace, and he's looked at me with contempt and said a phrase in Greek, involving the word '*mouni*'. Fun fact, my best mate is Greek and the first words he taught were naturally all the swear words. My response? \n\n'And for calling me a cunt, you can leave right now sir.'\n\nHe left, grumbling. I returned to finish my report. Right, sorted. Let the manager know I'm out the front having a smoke. Take my badge off, sit down and look around. No sign of the freak from earlier - or the cops for that matter - so I start typing this up for y'all on my phone while I have a cigarette. Finish up, walk back inside. Spot a guy in the gaming room straight away that looked like trouble. \n\nThink of one the Corey's back in the 80's, or Keifer from The Lost Boys. About a foot or so shorter than me (6'3) and barely legal, red flannelette over a black singlet, round sunglasses, a... swagger I guess you'd call it. Twirling a drumstick (dafuq?) around with one hand whilst he's slack-jaw chewing away on gum. Just something that told me he was gunna be a dick. Smile again. \n\n'Excuse me sir; could I ask for your id and that you remove your sunglasses please?' He goes for his wallet. \n\n'Why do I hafta remove me sunnies?'    \n*chomp-squish-chomp-squish-chomp-squish*\n\n'Because your face must be visible at all times in the gaming room for the cameras. ID please.' He takes them off, sneers. Fumbles with cards in his wallet. Looks back up at me. \n\n'What if a Muslim chick walks in here then?' Wat.jpg, then without missing a beat I reply \n\n'A woman wearing a Niqab or Burqa would **NOT** walk in here because - as far as I know - gambling is haram for Muslims. ID.' \n\nHe looks at his wallet. 'I can't find...' \n\n'Doors this way.' \n\nHe starts slagging me off, top of his lungs. DM comes barreling over. \n\n'Greed, I have the police in the foyer. You want them to attend here?' \n\nI smile at the DM. 'That depends on the gentleman here.' I turn to look at the smartarse. 'Do you want the police here chief?' I drop the smile and lean in. 'Or would you prefer I drag you out of the venue by your fucking nostrils?' He walks as well. Pity, my dander was right up.\n\nWhen I finished typing this, it was 2300. Only another 7 hours to go. \n\nYay.",

        "text": "A bit of background info first. I am a Revenue Protection Officer (ticket inspector to some) and my job is to ensure passengers have the correct tickets and they are sitting in the right place (seat reservations, 1st class etc).\nSo today I enter the first class carriage and there's one solitary passenger sitting there. I check his ticket and I notice it is a standard class ticket. Bearing in mind that there are half a dozen notices on the platform and inside the first class carriage regarding the fact that standard class ticket holders are liable for a penalty fare if they sit in first class, I explain to him that this is what I am now issuing him with. \n\n\n\"Oh come on blud! I ent' got a job. I'm on ma way to a job interview now!\".\n\n\nNow while I appreciate his effort to become less dependant on the welfare state, I still have a job to do. With that he produces an email on a smart phone the size of a small tv.\nSure enough, he is on his way to a job interview. At the top of the email, it has in bold letters:\n\n**YOU MUST BRING PHOTO ID WITH YOU**\n\n\nor words to that effect.\nHe claims that he has no money on him. I ask how he paid for his ticket. He said he borrowed \"some coins\" from a friend. I can tell that the ticket was bought with a credit or debit card. When I confront him with this, he claims to have paid the money into his bank account first.\n\n\nConvenient but vaguely plausible.\nSo I decide to issue him an unpaid Penalty Fare. This means I take his name and address and he has 21 days to pay, otherwise the railway company take him to court for fare evasion.\n\n\nHe gives me a name and address which doesn't match when I check the system (connected to credit reference and electrol roll data). The postcode doesn't match the road name and there is nobody living at the address with that name anyway. \n\n\nSo before I confront him with this, I ask if he has any ID on him. The bank card he bought his ticket with perhaps? \n\n\"Naa mate I must 'ave lost it\"\n\nAlso convenient, but even more vaguely plausible considering the ticket machine is about 20 feet from the platform.\n\n\"What about a passport or a driving licence?\"\n\n\"Naa I don't carry ID round with me\"\n\nHere in the UK, it isn't (yet) a legal requirement to carry ID with you. However, this was where I knew he had talked himself into a corner.\n\n\"Well, you might as well get off at the next stop with me because your job interview requires you to have photo ID on you - otherwise you can't attend the interview\"\n\nHe gives me a grim look, looks at the phone in his hand, which is still showing the email from his prospective employer.\n\n5 seconds of silent reading of the screen and he pulls a UK driving licence out of his front jeans pocket and passes it to me with a long sigh.\n\nSurely enough the name, address and even the town he gave originally is nothing remotely like his real name and address.\nSo I take a copy of his details onto the system, issue the penalty fare notice and explain he has 21 days to pay or appeal against it (plus the boring legal statement I have to read to him).\n\nAs I walked out of the carriage, he muttered some obscenity under his breath but I just ignored it and carried on checking the rest of the train.",

As you New Englanders know, snow is royally fucking us at the moment so nobody was going anywhere yesterday and the building is completely empty on Sundays anyways.\nBeing in a gigantic vacant corporate building for eight hours constantly walking around checking for fire or leaks can get boring and I start to go a little crazy while I'm doing it, which can provide some little known benefits such as practicing funny voices and accents (I'm great at a German and Irish accent now and perfected the Underpants Gnomes and a gobbling turkey yesterday). I would never do this with people around but since it's vacant I just talk to myself and sing to myself (tends to be Assassins Creed Black Flag sailor songs) and whistle and be strange in general.\nI digress. I was doing my rounds and walking around being strange as usual and I was pretty flatulent from (I'm assuming) all the drinking the night before so I'm basically propelling myself forward solely on methane. Anyways, I love farting so I'm letting them rip with gusto as, again, THERES NOBODY THERE. I'm just walking along farting up a storm talking to myself in a German accent and a big fart is about to come by so again, as I'm in a strange mood I take a running start and jump and land with both feet facing away from the opening of a cubicle thinking nothing of it and let a huge fart go, laughing to myself because how funny would it be if there was someone in there.\nTHERE WAS SOMEONE IN THE CUBICLE. I hear a gasp and so I turn around very fast with my jaw dropped and there's a middle aged woman in there staring at me eyes wide open, looking like I just shot a baby deer, and so I start apologizing profusely (in a German accent at first but I caught myself after the first \"sorry\") and she looks like she's about to vomit but she holds it in and couldn't stop laughing after that. Got away clean, but damn was I embarassed. Apparently she just came to pick up her laptop as today is a holiday and she had work to catch up on.\nTLDR: Farted on a lady in a German accent.",

Technically it's for a gaming room attached to the hotel, but y'know, cost cutting and all that. People get rowdy in rooms, vagrants in the lobby etc, I do my thing. The first is a rarity as it's a fairly upper market hotel, second is a constant cos it's warm/air conditioned.\n\nSo a few hours ago, I'm at post. Do a walk around and stick my head into the lobby. There's a bloke at the reception that's fairly animated in his body language, and quite damn drunk arguing with the ADM. Don't know how (at the time) but he had vomit on his *back*. Lovely! Make eye contact with the DM, he flags me over. The bloke turns around and he's got a decent gash above the eye - bleeding profusely - scuffed up cheek bone swelling quickly, and vomit everywhere on the front of his shirt.\n\nI shit you not, I had to suppress a giggle as this bloke talked as he sounded **exactly** like Arnie. Flat out 'Cmaaahn, get ta tha choppa!' Austrian accent. So read the italics in the voice of Arnie for added effect. \n\n'Damn sir, what happened here? DM, get some ice please.' \n\n*'Ive been ahsking Fa help fa an Owah!'* (in reality, little over 5 minutes. Very drunk) \n\n'Well I'm here to help now sir. Could you sit down over here please?' \n\n*'Noh, FARK YOUUU! HALP ME!'*\n\n'Sir, I'm trying to help. All I know right now is you're bleeding heavily, you've been drinking, and I need you to sit down so I can help you.' \n\n*'Noh, I'm fine! I just need HALP!'*\n\n'Which is what I'm trying to do sir.' I notice he was clutching a small towel, offered by staff to staunch the bleeding I presume. 'Could you at least give me the towel your holding so I can start administering First Aid before the Ambulance arrives?' (I could hear the DM on the phone to them.) he did not like that. \n\n*'DOHNT FARKING TOUCH ME! I need HALP!'* steps back, stumbles a bit.\n\n...\n\n'Very well sir, could you at least press the towel above your eye to staunch the blood flow?' Ice arrives. 'Or put this just here,' pointing at my own brow that would cover the cut and ice the swelling at the same time,' so we can control that bleeding and swelling?' \n\nHe just looks at me for a few seconds. \n\n*'Hoo da fark ah you?'* \n\n-sigh-'I'm Hotel Security sir, and also the person trying to give you First Aid so you don't look like a swollen bloody mess in the morning.' \n\n*'...I just want some halp!'* \n\nIn my minds eye, I see me shaking him by the collar like an abused redheaded step-son. I keep smiling. \n\n'Sir, you are a guest at this Hotel, yes?' He nods. 'Well as you are a guest, we have a duty of care to look after you if you are injured, which you obviously are. Does this make sense to you?' He nods. Progress! 'So if you don't want me to stop that blood flow, fine. I won't. You can refuse First Aid, that's your right. But please sir, for your safety, could you at least sit down until the ambulance arrives?' \n\nTen seconds clicks by, whilst he looks at me like a cat looks at it's owner; apathetic and contemptuous. \n\nHe sits. \n\nI step back, DM steps in to keep him occupied. The Assistant DM waves me out of earshot and informs me what had happened beforehand. \n\nThe ADM was outside having a cigarette when Arnie crosses the road. He remembered him from check in, little over an hour ago. Also remembered he was a bit tipsy, even then. So Arnie has wandered across the road and got his shoe caught in the tram tracks. Tumbles head first into the ground: right that explains the blood. ADM was already on the way over when Arnie vomits shortly after impact, rolling over as he does so. Okay, that explains the vomit on his back too. Took him in, got him a towel to staunch the now pissing out head wound, and clean himself up. DM makes the call for an ambo, ADM is trying to get Arnie to clean up. That's where I had walked in. \n\nAfter more of the same argument above, the Paramedics thankfully arrive. We scoot away a bit to let them work, I stay just within a few strides in case he gets nasty with them. They do their thing and load him on the stretcher. One of the Medics lets us know which hospital he's going to, as I'm mentally jotting down all this for my report later. \n\nHere's the kicker, and again I shit you not - as Arnie is getting stretchered out I could hear him call out plaintively - and I quote: \n\n*'Why is der vohmit on mah shirt? Who did this?!?'* \n\nLobby doors close, all of us piss ourselves laughing. I just hope for Arnie's sake that it was just the booze making him say that, and not a head injury. \n\n*fin.*",

Right after he leaves a huge drunk native guy \nwho we see time from time come in. He never causes us trouble\nbut when we start doing our jobs that conflict his fun (like \ndenying his friends for not having ID) he gets really aggrevaited.\nNow other doorman says \"Hey buddy, you're too intoxicated\nI can't let you in.\" Doormans 6'3 400lbs. Manager tonight is 5'10 320lbs \nI'm 5'9 250lbs. This guy is 6'3 at least 350 tops 400 but unlike \nmy bouncer buddy he's more muscle then fat so we were \nfairly intimidaited. He starts saying \"I'm not fucking drunk!\" \nwhile slightly wobbling and slurring his words. Manager steps in\nand tells him about how we'd get fined if we let him in.\nJust trying to reason with the guy.

I was planning on kicking the back of his knee and\nsqueezing what ever I could grab (Good plan eh?) Reason wasn't \nworking he starts yelling \"You're not letting me in because \nI'm Native!!\" I stiffle a laugh and walk in front of him and say \n\"Buddy, I'm native\" Now he's pissed he does not like\nbeing told he's wrong. He puts his hand in front of my face and says\n\"I didn't fucking ask your opinion\" and he appears to want to punch me\nbut my manager gets his attention again so I go back to my spot.\nNow another native from a table close by comes over and trys to bribe\nmy manager. (I don't like my race lol) Now a group of about 6 people walk in\nBuddy scans their IDs they sit next to the table where the other native was \nOne of them says \"If he punches a bouncer, I'm jumping in\" so a little fuck\nfrom the other table hears him and grabs the guys throat. He pushes him off\neasily but starts a lil shove match. So we deal with that. Drunk native goes sits\ndown at the bar were three regular girls talk to him. I keep an eye on him and\nseperate the two guys and then kick out the small guy. Native number two wants \nto fight this guy now too so he gets pushed seperate them. bring the white guy to a the door and his group. tell native2 to leave he tries to grab dude again gets pushed \ninto the wall cuts his head and we send him on his way. Now big native gets up...\nAND WALKS OUT THE DOOR!! Thanks to our regulars they were telling him to leave\nguys always end up listening to girls. Now he pushes the door hard and takes \ntwo steps and slips on the ice hitting his face Yay justice. (manager was about to \nsalt it. It was freezing rain for about an hour) Bought a round for the ladies \nLet the group stay he was just defending himself and turns out they were bouncers\nat another club in town. So we are like okay time for peace.... NOPE \n20mins later a regular flips a table sending drinks flying cussing out his friend \nwanting to fight him. I grab him send him out the back door. He tries to drive home.\nManager yells at him pays for a taxi. He gets in the taxi and they drive off. \nHe jumps out of the taxi down the road and gets back into his truck and drives home.\n\n\nThis was long as fuck so here... start of Friday the 13th big native potential problem\nthen fights almost break out due to him.

        "text": "So my last story was really well received in TFR. (The Iced Coffee Tragedy) so I decided to write a couple more as I remember them.   \n  \n**Background** I work in a nightclub. A nightclub oriented towards adult entertainment. I am at the front door in coatcheck. I take jackets and cover charge. I am usually the first and last face they see during their night out. This can be both a good and a bad thing. \n  \n**Story**\nThis happened on Friday around 7 pm. It was still early and there wasn't a lot of people in the door.   \nIn come two girls. Early 20th I would say. They're pretty quiet and giggly. Not a big deal. A lot of people are like that when they come in. They don't know what to do in a stripclub. Their nerves get the better of them.   \nOnce their ids get checked, they come see me at coat check and I take their jackets. So far so good. Then they pass their purses to the bouncer to go through. *this is totally normal in Canada. We check for weapons and narcotics and any contraband materials*   \nThis conversation takes place. B is bouncer. G1 is the first girl. G2 is the second girl.   \n*B is searching through G1's purse. He opens her cigarette carton to and pulls out a little tablet of lsd. He holds it up into her view.*  \nB: Have a good night.  \nG1: I'm sorry what?   \nB: I told you,  have a good night. I found illegal drugs on you. You're not coming in.  Have a good night.   \nG1: are you serious? Come on man! *all during this time she's giggling.  Thinking this is some kind of joke*  \nG2: come on. Let's just go.   \n*They walk out the door. They're out of sight for a few minutes then come back in*  \nG1: do you know [DANCERS NAME]?  \nB: of course I do. Why?   \nG1: well those were for her. She asked me to bring them in for her!  \nB: Well I still can't help you. I've confiscated this from you and I'm on camera. If im caught giving it back, as far as the law in concerned I'd be seen as a drug dealer. So no. Have a good night.   \n*They eventually grab their jackets from me and leave. The dancer that they were trying to bring drugs in for runs up the stairs. *   \nD: did you just kick out two girls?!   \nB: yeah they had drugs on them.   \nD:I asked them to bring it in for me!  \nB: then you're an idiot.  \n*She ran off presumably to call her friend that we just kicked out.*  \n*Both the girls that came in were banned for what I think it's probably the stupidest attempted drug deal I've ever witnessed..*  \n  \nI've seen many interesting things in what is coming up to be my fourth year working for this company. Let me know if you're interested in more! I will write them as I come up with them. \n\n\nTL;Dr: Girls try to bring drugs into the bar. Say it's for dancer. They get banned.",

        "text": "So this is slightly odd story but some of you can probably relate. Bit of a long story though, hopefully worth the read.\n\nA year after I ETS'd out of the army, I was working unarmed security at a pretty nice post, the headquarters of an oil and natural gas company. Tons of eye-candy worked there, amazing cafe with cooks who didn't give a fuck and hooked us up with legit foods on the down-low for free, cool guys to work with, not a bad gig at all.\n\nAs you contract security guys know, paid time-off is hard to come by. I had only been working there for 8 or so months at this point, so I had zero vacation days. I wanted to take a couple days off and go see one of my old army buddies in Florida who was on mid-tour leave from Afghanistan. So, I traded shifts with some of the dudes that worked there, they would split up three of my shifts (first shift, 7a-3p) and I would work some weekend/night shifts for them. Easy.\n\nHere is where I started to fuck up. The two and half days I spent with my army buddy were nothing but drunken debauchery. Up all night bar-hopping, trying to pick up chicks, basically making complete asses of ourselves.  All the standard stuff you see with army dudes. The final day there, I almost didn't sleep at all. He was going back to the 'stan in a couple days and we stayed up all night getting wasted and getting lap dances. I slept for forty minutes on the plane, with a shift in 4 hours. It is now 11a.  \n\nI ran home, showered and got into uniform and went to work for 12 hours, hungover as fuck.  I got off of work at 3a and passed out for 4 hours, with another 12 hour shift from 7a-7p.\n\nI was dead guys. If the Walking Dead needed an extra, I would have been perfect. Thankfully, no big wigs were around on the weekends because I was a zombie.  Come 5p, I had to do a round through the dock and check all the standard stuff you check, machine rooms, air handlers, whatever. \n\nI got down there and I'm so tired I started hallucinating.  You know that feeling between your shoulder blades when something is watching you? Had that going. Between the shadows and my caffeine and nicotine fueled exhaustion, I thought I was in hell and demons were chasing me. \n\nMan, I ran through that dock, keys and detex wand in hand, hitting my points while the demons/shadows chased me.  By the time I got back to the desk, I was panting and pretty freaked out.  All the creaks and groans of the building were so creepy by this point I didn't move until the next shift arrived.  I then passed out in my car for couple hours before I could drive home.\n\nMoral of story? I'm an idiot.  \n\n\nEdit for missed word",

When I was hired, I didn't have a security license so I applied through my employer.  \n\nI checked on it periodically for a few months but it was always \"pending\".  I notified my employer several times and they said they were working on correcting it as soon as possible.\n\nWell, I just checked the official government website for verifying a license in my state, and now the application has gone from \"pending applicant\" to \"application expired\" and my \"rank\" is \"failed applicant\".  \n\nIs this common?  I'm 22 years old and have absolutely nothing on my record that would cause problems getting this license.  I don't even have any traffic violations.  Never been arrested, nada.\n\nAny advice or other input?  I can't afford to be laid off until they get their shit together, so I'm actually pretty concerned about having to contact my employer to let them know.  I can't be out of work for a week or five while they fuck around.",

        "text": "A little background, I work armed patrol. Some of our accounts are income based housing for the elderly and disabled. Along with making regular stops during our shifts, we also handle calls for things such as disputes, assists, and welfare checks. Aside from having mental and physical disabilities, a lot of these people are also heavily medicated, which can make for some very interesting interactions. I've received calls about imaginary stalkers, the police shining laser beams into peoples windows for no no apparent reason, neighbors playing recordings of \"low volume, high intensity\" noise as an attempt to harass tenants for absolutely no reason at all. All in all, these people could be described as \"magical\".\n\nAnyway, one of our accounts that is income restricted for disabled/elderly is partially run by a Baptist church. Most of the residents are elderly African-Americans, and they are a very nice bunch who love to talk to us and are very nice people. On top of that, they really like having us around. However, they have one tenant who is a little different than the rest.\n\n\"Stacy\" (Name obviously changed) is a white woman who is 28 years old. Stacy meets the requirements to live in the community because she suffered severe head trauma which has left her with significant brain damage. Due to the demographics of the community she lives in, she doesn't have too many friends who live there (If any friends at all).\n\nThe whole Stacy saga started one night when my supervisor was making a usual patrol stop and was stopped in the halls by Stacy. Stacy said she had lots of \"security concerns\". They weren't really security related matters, mostly just her talking about how she had a \"condition\" and how she came to have brain damage. Being the nice guys we are, my supervisor told her that if she needed anything to give us a call and handed her one of our business cards.\n\nUsually when someone who provides a service in relation to their job, the phrase \"call us if you need anything\" means that if you need something in relation to the service provided, you call them for that and only that. If your plumber says \"I've finished fixing your toilet, call me if you need anything\", it can be implied that you only call your plumber back if something is wrong with your toilet. This doesn't mean call your plumber at 0200 just to \"talk\". I'm sure Y'all can see where this is going.\n\nAnyway, the calls from Stacy began innocent enough. They were usually for little things that didn't amount to anything, such as noise complaints for an upstairs neighbor who was watching Jeopardy too loud, or a \"suspicious\" vehicle in the parking lot that usually wasn't there by the time we made it there.\n\nStacy would also stop us in the halls during our patrol stops, and since we try our best to be nice guys, we would listen to her talk. We all figured she was pretty lonely living with a bunch of old people, so we did our best to be nice.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the calls started to become more and more frequent. She would call at all hours of the night to ask some really strange questions (Such as would it be safe to \"like\" your company's Facebook page). She would also give us stacks of business cards for her blog every time we came by (We still have a stack of these at our office). We figured that she just wanted to talk, so we kind of let it slide. We also found out she was super supportive of the military, after she found out that both myself and my supervisor are both veterans. Since my supervisor has family who works for the VA, we started to get calls from Stacy who wanted to donate stuff to the VA, which usually consisted of old People magazines and notepads.\n\nWe finally added her number as a contact in our work phone so that we could tell if she was calling when we were busy doing something else (We also do stops/calls for service in Section 8 housing, so we frequently get busy). One of our guys would answer her call, say hi, and then set the phone on the dashboard, and she would talk for about a half hour, none the wiser to the fact that no one was listening. I would usually put the phone on speaker, say “uh huh” every few minutes, and continue driving. My supervisor would just ignore her calls altogether.\n\nAfter about a month of Stacy calling us non-stop, I came into work and found an e-mail from our daytime supervisor saying that we needed to stop answering her phone calls. Apparently she started calling during the day, and would talk to our admin for about 45 minutes at a time. This didn't really deter her too much, and the calls soon turned into voice-mails, which were very long and drawn out, and usually ended with Stacy asking us to call her back. After a few days of giving her the cold shoulder, I was back at our office, wrapping up on the nights paperwork in preparation for shift change, when I get a phone call. Since I was in the middle of finishing a rather lengthy report, I didn't think to look who was calling on the work cell and it was Stacy. \n\nStacy began by asking why we weren't answering her calls, in which I responded that we were busy (Which was partially correct). She then went on to say that her counselor had become concerned about her infatuation with us. She said that her counselor felt that she was starting to overstep her bounds with us, and that she needed to back off and only contact us for immediate security concerns. She said that she was not acting inappropriate, and that we were very respectful, and that she didn't agree with what her counselor said. She told her counselor that we said to “call us if you need anything” and that she was holding us to our word. I told her that her counselor was just trying to help, and that she should probably listen to what her counselor was telling her, as a counselor is probably better able to help her deal with her issues rather than some sleep deprived security guard. This was obviously not the answer she wanted to hear. She then asked me to contact her counselor and explain that out interactions were not inappropriate. I immediately said that this was not a decision that I could make, and in an attempt to be nice, I told her that this was something I needed approval for. She then asked me to take down her counselors contact info so we could get back to him as soon as possible. Since this phone call already kept me at work 20 minutes after I was supposed to go off-duty and start my weekend, I told her to tell me the contact info, which I didn't take down. I wanted to tell her that it was probably not a good idea to tell her counselor that he was wrong, but I figured at this point it was useless in trying to communicate any sort of reason to Stacy. So I sent some e-mails to my supervisor to let him in on the conversation.\n\nAfter I came back from my weekend, I let our daytime supervisor in on the situation during the shift change. There were more phone calls in the time I was away, and we were given instructions that if we received any more calls from her, that we needed to tell her that if we continued to take calls from her that weren't job related, we needed to tell her that we could lose our jobs over using the work phone for purposes other than work. We figured that if we started using the threat of people losing their jobs, that she would back off.\n\nLater that evening, while conducting my nightly ritual of downing a pot of coffee in preparation of showing up to work, I get a call from my supervisor. I answer the phone, and he tells me he just had a conversation with the apartment manager of Stacy's apartments. According to the apartment manager, Stacy was involved with a similar situation with the local police. Our local PD has a mobile crisis unit, who deals with people having psychological issues, and they received so many calls from Stacy that the mobile crisis unit went as far as to file a no-contact order against Stacy stating that they would only deal with her if it was an actual emergency. It was then suggested that if we really wanted her to quit calling us, we needed to make her cry.\nSo my supervisor, who was finally fed up with everything, went and knocked on her door. He then yelled at her, telling her that we weren't a dial-a-friend service, that we could all lose our jobs over this, and that we were going to report her to management. My supervisor then told me she started to cry, do some weird breathing thing while crying, and then start crying and doing the weird breathing thing. She apologized profusely, and said that she always takes things too literally. My supervisor then went on to say that he just had to yell at a brain damaged person and now he will more than likely spend an eternity in the worst parts of Hell. This was then followed up with a notice from the management stating that if Stacy contacted us for anything other than an immediate security related issue, she could possibly be evicted\n\nSince then, we have only received one call from a friend asking to clarify our policies in regards to interaction with clients. Of course we saw right through this (Her friend refused to identify who she was calling for), and she was quickly shut down. So far we have yet to receive any calls from Stacy.\n\nTL;DR – Be careful when you tell people to “call us for anything”",

But for the longest time, whenever he was confronted for any reason, he would refuse to give his name and usually run off. This happened often, he really liked his drugs. Especially meth.\n\nOne day I was off duty taking a short detour on my way home so I could grab a coffee. I'm passing through a public square in front of our city hall and I spot him harassing some nervous teenagers. He's clearly hopped up. He's getting pretty aggressive. I put a call into the peace officers (like cops but unarmed. They do the security for our city hall, hospitals, and transit system) In the mean time, I decide to go talk to him to see if he'll maybe calm down while I wait for the officers to show up.\n\nIm talking to him, he stays aggressive but I keep trying to get him to either calm down or go away, he's just getting more agitated. \n\nAfter not too long, the peace officers show up. One of them is a very no-nonsense woman. First thing she says is \"Sir, what is your name?\"\n\nHe screams at her 'FUCK YOU\"\n\nWithout missing a beat or even changing her tone she goes \"alright Mr. You, you're going to have to come with us\"\n\nI almost burst out laughing. I told some other guard buddies this story, and in the space of a month everyone in the area was calling him \"Mr. You\". And even when he was (relatively) sober, he could never figure out why.",

Not really what I signed up for, I kind of liked my old sites where I could site in a cruiser and watch Netflix all night, but I thought this would be a chance to prove myself.\n\nAnd let me tell you, my work ethic prevented me from doing anything other than hard work out here. 4 months in the company, working 60-90 hours a week because no one else would work out here, and instead of getting praised and moved to something easier, I end up becoming supervisor of the damn place. \n\nSo fast forward to me pissing off an asshole trucker. When everyone goes home, there are still plenty of dedicated drivers and inbound drops from people who haven't even heard of this place before. Of course, it's my job to do all the paperwork for them. \n\nSome dedicated guys don't care. If I'm out on patrol (still gotta do something security wise) after hours, they'll just open the gate themselves and leave. Outbound? Not a big deal if they're just bobtailing. Inbound? Well shit. There's a lot of information I need.\n\nAs the truck breaks down and I have to walk all the way back to the guardshack, I see one owner operator run through the gate, trailer and everything. I flash my flashlight, but he just think honks. When he gets to the outbound gate, I get on his truck (so we can hear each other), and she shouts at me to get down.\n\nWith a stern, very bad day induced voice, I shout back \"What trailer did you bring in, what time, was it loaded, were there any tarps?\" He gives me some lip, but gives me the information. Now I just happen to have all the dedicated driver's phone numbers, the whole go above and beyond thing, and I have a good relationship with most of them. I text him \"Btw, you really shouldn't piss off the guy who watches your truck all night.\"\n\nWow. I'm an idiot. I was implying for him to imagine I wouldn't do anything if someone vandalised his truck (which has been a problem in the past), but of course he takes it as a threat and the rest of the conversation was him assuming I was going to vandalize his truck. Plus he has recorded evidence. Plus I'm putting my two weeks in anyways.",

I worked mall security for an outdoor facility that was in a pretty crappy part of town. This particular area was known for violence almost every night (made night shifts fun), addicts, homeless,  and most certainly.....prostitutes. \n\nThe company provided nothing but a radio, handcuffs, flashlight, and nitrile gloves for our duty belts, so we were pretty screwed if they had any weapons. I worked night shifts from 2100-0600, and went to school part time during the day. I was in the middle of the police academy at the time, and the area provided a plethora of learning opportunities when it came to criminal activity.\n\nThis particular shift I remember it being a little cold and it was a torrential downpour causing all the water runoff to seep into the underground parking structures. I was doing building lockups and store checks when I was dispatched to check the water pumps on the first floor of the garage. The overflow alarms were apparently ringing off the hook in the office. So I head down into the depths of filth, floor by floor and arrive down where the pump room was. No flooding, pumps working decently I radio back all clear and decide to have a look around the structure for any leaks.\n\nI round the edge of a corner pillar and I come upon a gentleman slumped against it, his arm outstretched and a needle still half primed with what appeared to be an oily black substance. After I gloved up, I attempt to wake him and get no response, I radio in that we need medical and police on the first floor, as well as any additional officers that were free to assist. After a frantic 5 minutes I finally get him to respond with a slurred \"what the fuck do you want?\"\n\nConversation is as follows.\n\nCactusBat: \" Hey buddy, I'm officer cactus with (outdoor mall place). You okay?\"\n\nHarry Hobo: \"I'm fine, go the fuck away\"\n\nCB: \"you were unconscious and breathing real shallow. What's your name?\"\n\nHH: \" NUNYA\"\n\nCB: \"Well, seeing as you are here...it's kind of my business. I've told you my name, what's yours?\"\n\nHH: \"Harry!\"\n\nCB: \"Okay Harry,  what's that in your arm?\"\n\nHH: \"I'm a diabetic, it's Insulin!\"\n\nCB: \"insulin? Are you type 1 or a type 2 diabetic?\"\n\nHH: \"Type 2!\"\n\nCB: \"Sooooooo....insulin is black, oily, and looks like it came out if an engine block?\"\n\nHH: \"It's a new formula!\"\n\nJust then, police and EMS arrived, as well as four of my coworkers. They checked him out, he was borderline overdose on heroin, had several low level warrants, and was taken to the hospital and later...jail.\nHope you enjoyed this story, it's my first time posting!\n\nAnd remember kids: heroin is now insulin!",

We'll call the warehouses A and B, which is pretty close to what we called them internally.\n\nAnyway, my shift this day was a morning shift, 0600 to 1400. I'm sitting at the security desk in warehouse A, monitoring the cameras and security system. After a couple hours, the cameras start going offline. Then the security system monitoring program goes offline. Since the \"servers\" for both these systems (the cameras are actually split between warehouses and on actual DVR servers, but the security system is just on a crappy desktop PC) are in warehouse B, I pick up the phone and call the guard who's at the desk there right now. The phone rings, rings, rings, then cuts off. I try calling again, but the phone is now telling me that it can't connect to that number.\n\nWell, this is weird.\n\nLuckily there's another guard at the desk with me, so I head over to the other warehouse. I walk in and ask what happened. The conversation went something like this:\n\nMe: What happened?\nOther guard: The power went out. I'm trying to get everything back up now.\nMe: Okay. Anyone still inside?\nOG: I don't think so, but there were a couple people here today.\nMe: Okay, I'll go patrol inside to make sure.\n\nSo I take a radio and make sure there's nobody inside the warehouse. While I'm inside I remember that my phone's in my pocket, and that we take any electronics that are brought in the warehouse and hold them for 24 hours... But whatever, I can deal with that later.\n\nI walk around the warehouse and notice that the emergency lights are still on and the warehouse lights are still off. As I walk around, the emergency lights start to go off but the warehouse lights don't turn back on. I radio the guard at the desk, get her to turn them off and back on. After a few minutes, they turn back on.\n\nI finish my patrol and there's nobody in the warehouse. I head back to the desk, but rush through the scanners and head back over to warehouse A to explain the situation and get the rest of my stuff; I decided to stick around in warehouse B to make sure everything gets up and running properly.\n\nBy the time I get back, the DVRs are running with a couple cameras offline. Our only contact for situations like this is the warehouse LP manager (our manager), so I get on the phone and call him. I also send out an email to our TLs and our Security Supervisor to update them on the situation. The LPM tells me to restart the DVRs and he gives me some troubleshooting steps for the security monitoring system. These don't work, so he decides to come in.\n\nI have a fair amount of computer expertise, so I start looking for any error messages or any other indications of why the server software won't start. It takes a while, because I can tell it to start and it will just silently refuse, but eventually I find an error message in Event Viewer.\n\n\"The warranty period has expired so the software will not start.\"\n\nMy response is \"...what.\" I tell this to the LPM, who has gotten here by now and is sitting in a nearby office working. He tells me that one of out TLs has seen the issue before and to call the security system company and get them to guide me through extending the warranty period, so that's what I try to do.\n\nTurns out that they only have three technicians working, none of whom are willing to do it over the phone. One insists that it's a problem for Installation, who doesn't work weekends, and the other two would only be willing to come on site and look at it. That was an unacceptable option, as it would have cost close to $1000 for something they could just guide us through over the phone.\n\nAt least the system itself was still working, so anyone who needed access to the warehouse could still use their cards to get in and out, but if anyone needed a temporary card or new card, then they're SOL. Have to wait for a technician to help get the system running again. Which is a bit of a problem, since the earliest a technician could help was Monday, and people worked in the warehouse Sunday through Thursday.\n\nBut by that point there was nothing I could do. I turned in my badge and notebook and headed home, ready to start the next job and go back to school.",

        "text": "So I worked security in a HUGE museum in the middle of nowhere. I know that sounds weird, but bear with me here.\n\n\n\nOur security system was a practical joke. It was 3 monitors made in the 80's, a computer that was assembled in 1996, and software that made the security guard we'll refer to as \"chuck\" (who is 76) look like he was 20. Now, chuck was like the unofficial \"head\" of security. We didn't really have a head of security, but he had worked there for like 40 years and basically ran the place. He was chill as shit though. Anyway.\n\n\n\nSo the museum had a special winter exhibit, which just ended a few months ago. I worked security, as most of our tourists come from Asia. Why? Idk, apparently glass sculptures are a huge deal. Anyways, this lady and her family were walking through an ''open gallery', which means all of the pieces are on open display. It's a room probably 50 feet by 50 feet, and we had three security guards watching this room. (This room was packed, so they added an extra guard.) this lady, and her family, in front of all of us, begin loading in these glass figurines and shit into their bags! we have cameras, so we radio in and ask if they can check it out, in case we are mistaken. NOPE they saw it to. Ok. So i politely walk up and explain that this art work is museum property. They deny it like the devil. I explain we have them on camera, and they need to return it immediately. Uh... hold on... what's this? you suddenly speak no english? NO ENGRISH? I was so sick of it that day, I seriously started fuming out of my ears. I told him he had one more chance to put it back and leave. He gave me some shpeal about how he paid, and it's a tourist company, yada yada. Dude, IDGA SINGLE F about that. I told him to come with me, he refuses. I just laughed and walked away. This family had shit in there bags, but I can't do much without getting into trouble. SO...what did I do? Nothing. I followed them, I pointed at him and told him he was going to be arrested if he didn't return it, he ignored me and continued through the museum (I couldn't believe it either.) Within 3 minutes the police were there, inside, looking for me. I got a call over the radio to look out for 2 officers coming into the west wing. I found them, guided them to the family, and they were all arrested for art theft or something. Apparently it's a huge fine, if not jail time. The officer asked me why I didn't do anything. I explain \"If that 100,000 dollar glass figurine of a ballerina broke, I can't afford that shit!\" at least he laughed.",

Today was different though.\n\nI work at a mall and there's a food court vendor currently under renovations. As I re-entered after an external patrol, I saw a bunch of boys about my age fake-punching the dry wall. After watching them continue for a moment, I thought I'd approach them and see what's going on. I decided to break the ice with a super lame joke. \n\n\"You break it, you buy it guys!\"\n\nThey all stared blankly at me.\n\n\"Uh,\" the fake-puncher says, \"I wasn't actually punching it.\"\n\n\"...I know. It was a joke.\" This is when things started to escalate.\n\n\"I WASN'T ACTUALLY PUNCHING IT, WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING US?\"\n\n\"Why are you being so defensive?\"\n\n\"WHY ARE YOU BEING SO ATTACKATIVE?\" Wut. \"MA'AM, YOU ARE CAUSING A SCENE.\"\n\n\"No I'm not? Calm down.\"\n\n\"MA'AM, LOOK AROUND. YOU ARE CAUSING A SCENE.\"\n\n\"Do you want a ban? Because if you keep harassing me, you're going to get banned!\" That's when their friend came over from a nearby vendor and I could tell he was pretty embarrassed about his friends' behavior. He attempted to explain that they were just getting food as the boys kept interrupting him to continue yelling at me.\n\n\"YEAH, WELL WE DON'T LIKE JOKES.\"\n\nI walked away, shaking. I wasn't sure if I was mad or what emotions were running through my head. I basically called over my other guards and explained what went down, headed back to the office, and promptly called my Dad (a police officer) to ask him if he's ever been yelled at by someone he was joking with on the job.\n\nAs much as I like to think that my confidence and assertiveness have improved dramatically over the past 6 months of working as a guard, there's always some incident where someone gets rude or yells at me and it still shakes me up.\n\nLesson learned, no more lame jokes with 20-somethings.\n",

        "text": "This is from a few years ago when I used to work mall, afternoon supervisor.  So it’s a Friday night, half way into the shift and we get a call about a fight outside of one of the anchor stores.  That store was already notorious for let’s say, interesting arrests with their budget LP staff.  I stop doing my paperwork and head out as I know it’s only a matter of time before I’ll get called to deal with it anyway.  Half way there I get a call that the on scene staff need a supervisor.  I meet up with the guy I’ve worked with for a couple years.  We go in, and there was an arrest which had turned into a fight but now had stopped.  I immediately know this is going to shit, as I see the LP.  Problem moron.  Big (6’4 approx 280), dumb, hyper aggressive, thought he had the powers of a police officer (we had issues with illegal search as well as false arrest with this guy) and hated me because I wouldn’t let him rough up some teenagers who were nonviolent in the past.  Two of my guards (one a newbie) were already on scene.\n\nSo I approach the scene, and the LP has this 90 pound soaking wet street kid in the front of the store (even though they normally held in the back) and two guards were between them, one facing the LP and one facing the suspect.  I try and lead the LP away to talk to him but he refuses to go, yelling and swearing at us for getting involved in “his arrest”.  I explain our call was for a fight, we were separating the two parties and he should call the police, we’ll wait with them.  My guard advises me, upon his arrival the LP had the suspect half his size by the shirt and was slamming him against the wall while the kid way yelling for help.  The suspect overhears and tells me the LP was beating him up.  Which of course sets the LP off who starts to try and push past the guards to get to the suspect, his arms reached out grabbing for him.  At this point we stop him and the LP tells us to get out of his store.  I tell him to get the manager (who I’m friends with, and said he thought the guy was crazy) to tell me and I would.  Otherwise I’m not leaving him alone with the suspect.  He goes off about his arrest and tries to push past us again.  This time we push him away, which starts an all-out brawl.  Guy grabs me by the neck, while I grab his thumb and twist to force his grip off, the other two guards rush him.  Which causes the suspect to see an opening and go to bolt.  My partner was standing support watching from the exterior.  He comes in and we grab the suspect, who is now freaking out and flailing.\n\nSo the scene at the moment is, two guards on the massive LP, and two guards on the tiny suspect.  We take down the suspect with ease and I look up and see the guards unable to take the LP down, they are trying their best, but they didn’t have many take downs under their belt and didn’t work together well.  My partner has his back to the LP while on the suspect as the LP tries to knee him in the back of the head.  I yell left, and my partner lets go and moves out of the way.  I drag the suspect away from the bawl (Honestly, I’m the smallest out of the 4 of us, I was best served on the suspect) as I see one of the guards get thrown off the LP, replaced by my partner.  The guard gets up and charges back in bull rushing and knocking all of them to the ground.  No one has cuffs.  Luckily Police bike unit hears fight going on and rushes the store.  3 guards swap off with 3 cops, but the LP keeps fighting, cuffs are applied to the LP and not the suspect.  LP keeps fighting and kicking after police have identified themselves repeatedly.  Took one of the bike guys getting up and drawing his tazer in line of sight of the LP to get him to stop (guy was nuts).\nWe get 4 more constables on scene and the LP is losing his shit on them for arresting him.  The cops start questioning all of us and figure out what happened.  Suspect is released as the cops want no part of the paperwork for a questionable arrest.  While I’m standing inside with the LP and waiting to go over what happened, Police officer asks me to go outside, the suspect wants to talk to me.  I go outside with the cop and the kid pulls a bottle of pop and a candy bar and gives it to me.   Admits to stealing and thanks me and my staff for saving his ass from the LP.\n\nShit ton of paperwork afterwards, the security company tried to sue me and my client ordered I not go back to the store unless emergency.  But the look of thanks on that kids face made my night.  \n\nTLDR: got into a fight arrested an LP who was abusing suspect",

        "text": " So three Irish men walk into a pub...  \n  \nI don't normally work Sundays but the usual bouncer had the weekend off. It's going slow and Im dicking around at the front when buddy (we'll call him Bear) taps me on the shoulder and points towards the main bar. A group of three guys were squared off agaisnt another two. Theyre swearing at the two I step in to squash it before anything happens Bear steps in pushes the three guys back (hes 6'5 400 lbs) I hold off the two. The guy tells me hes a professional fighter (actually amatuer cage fighter) and he wont fight a guy in the bar its all good (I believe him Our main bouncer is also a cage fighter These guys have class) So I tell him \"That's nice but these people like to fight fighters and try to prove something\" somehow these three talk Bear out of kicking them out so He decides to just seperate them. You three over there and don't come around them tonight. I say fair enough. They mosey on over to the other side of the bar. I walk back to the front and watch both parties. Seemed like it was working for about five minutes then they must have thought we forgot about them (seriously peeps think we retrds with the memory of goldfish) so they walk back over and start talking to them again this time all buddy buddy. Me and Bear watch them and sure enough theyre back to swearing at each other. I say ffs and seperate them. The biggest Irish guy of the three was saying they were rasicts. I let Bear talk to them and hes saying \"It's time to go boys finish your drinks and leave\" They talk him down again with the help of the two they wanted to fight because those guys just didnt care and said they wont bug each other. (Yep drunk logic) Of course they go at again but this time they really push cage fighters patience so he walks outside to cool down (told yah they good guys) Now Ive had enough and put my foot down and tell them to go and basically everytime they tried to talk I said No drink your drinks and lets go. Get them going out the back door because CF was out the front. Two of them want to take a piss before they go so I escort the other one out and (Bear stayed up front because we always need a guy watching the front unless its an emergency) our backdoor bouncer lets call Chad waits for the other two. They finish we show them the door but smaller irish dude has a drink we tell him finish it before you leave and his buddy takes this opportunity to start up with me \"You stupid spick you want to throw me out? \"  I laugh and think fair enough I kinda look mexican but I'm actually native (got a funny story for that too if you want it). \"See this line you cant get me pass it. Throw me out then. See what happens\" Chad whispers to me \"if you want it go for it I got your back\" I was furious now I have a super quick temper and this guy had his hands up at me but I have a lot of patience and told Chad to get Beard (our manager for the nnight hes 5'7 150lbs but hes a ninja legit) and Bear so he waves them over we dont have walkies only fridays and sat and they didnt see him apparently. now another manager from another bar was trying to leave and irish lad here decides to verbally assualt him and hes like oh fuck that and stands there and yells back at this guy Irish guy goes for thee ol haymaker Misses completetly hits the wall and buddy starts wailing on him I grab him but not his hands and let him get a couple more good ones and throw him off of the guy. after that I grab the Irish from the back hes trying to run after buddy Chad yells\"choke him out\" GLADLY get my right forarm on his neck and instead of locking the other arm under and grabbing the back of the head i clasp hands and give him a good wrench and hes asleep within seconds and Bear and Beard run over after the commotion Me and Chad drag him outside put him in the recovery position and he wakes up instantly. We go back inside. Now usually when a guy gets choked out they learn they cant beat you and go home Not this guy! he walks back in \"Whyd you do that!!\" Chad gets too close he swings and clips him on the cheek. FULL RAGE but Beard was closer he runs at the guy and grabs him This asswipe turtles and Beard throws him agaisnt the wall bashing his head agaisnt the wall too and i run in trying to get my hands on him and we throw him outside again after a couple words we tell him we re calling the cops and they fuck off. \n  \nP.S one of our regulars was there the whole time willing to help because they cool like that  \n  \nIrish lads pick a fight with wrong people ... twice... gets choked out then thrown out twice",

We have security every night.  \nafter 9 we start scanning everyones I.D (no matter how old you look we I.D  \nso you can imagine the comments we get)  \n  \nSo all our bartenders know this guy I'll call Paul  from basically childhood.  \nLast year he got himself banned for a year due to fighting however it was removed  \nafter six months but was on a short leash. This last month he has really been pushing the limit by pushing over chairs and almost getting into fights.  \n(we'd stop it before it esculated).  \nNow last night we had a three man team two watching the front door one at the back and we'd rotate every hour. Fairly slow Friday only had scanned in 230 people. Didnt have any instances so when we're bored we just dick around laugh at people dancing and say stupid things over the radio. Then we give last call at two and all hell breaks loose...  \n  \nFirst situatio: some drunk guy decides its a good idea to slam his cup on the table. Manager goes to talk to him (was a bouncer moved up to managment so really 4 man team) This guy starts telling him to fuck off and really wants to fight Rick but his friends calm him down and get him outside we follow to make sure they leave in a cab As soon as they get outside drunk guy turns to try and fight again Ricks totally down but the friend got in the way and pulled him into a cab  \n  \nSoon after another drunk guy and his friends start picking a fight with Paul and his friends We rush in and seperate the two parties. Drunk guy still yelling at Paul calling him a pussy and such telling him to fuck himself all that good stuff so we grab him and his buddies threw them outside and tell them to leave but good ol drunks dont like to leave and one of them keeps rushing in yelling at them to come outside and fight them and telling the other bouncers hes going to call more friends to come and kill everyone (we get death threats a lot and laugh them off Most people say they're Hells Angels) These guys wont leave and our waiting outside for Paul so we call the non emergency number for police and tell them that and they still decide to wait. Now it's 2:30 and we're kicking everyone else out The bartenders are trying to keep Paul contained and calm but one of his buddies decides to go outside causing the rest of them to go out And we watch as the sparks fly...  \n  \nPauls friend Doug tries to talk to the drunk guys wanting to fight and our precence watching them from the door momentarily keeps them from swinging but not calm each of them swearing at each other waiting for one of them to start the fight until a girl slaps Paul and he freaks \"I'll hit a cunt in her face!!\" (totally agree fuck that pussypass) he tries to attack her as his friends hold him off and thats when the officers arrive. Two of them hop out of their cruisers and seeing the situation they equip their gloves....  \n  \nTwo guys still swearing at each other decide to start pushing Paul gets in there And an officer jumps in seperates them but Paul pushes her off and starts to go after her the other officer is not having that whips out his tazer (at first I thought it was a gun but then the pointer showed up on Pauls chest)  \n \n\"Get down NOW!\"  \nDoug grabs Paul to try and stop him  Rick yells at him to get away Doug steps back  \n\"Do it you bitch!\" Paul screams at the officer  \n\"Get down!!\"  \nPaul rips his over shirt off to give the officer a better shot takes a step forward points his hand at the cop  \n\"BITCH\"  \nThe other officer gets behind Paul grabs his hand to slap cuffs on First officer puts the tazer away rushes towards Paul as he rips away from the lady now its a scramble between the three and Paul gets a kick in causing the male officer to land a haymaker (remember those gloves aint something to not factor in) Paul drops...  \n  \nPaul still struggling asks \"am i underarrest?\"  Wish he said \"AM I BEING DETAINED\" Sadly no..   \n\"Yes youre under arrest!\" slaps the cuffs on gives him a lil more brutality throws him in the cruiser.  \n  \nSlow night then people wanted to fight Called cops on the instigators ended up arresting bartenders friend.",

        "text": "After my last story, I didn't work for another week and a half? Why? Because I didn't get scheduled, that's why. I called scheduling every day during that time, and every time I was told that I would get a call soon. So much for that consistent 40 hour a week job I had been promised, eh? I don't think I hit 40 hours more than twice during my time working for this company, but enough bitching, let's get to the story!\n\nOnce again it's 10pm, the beginning of the graveyard shift. Today, I'm stationed at a parking lot where all of the show's trucks are being stored about ten blocks from where I was in my last story. I cracked open a can of sugar-free Rockstar and got to patrolling. The beginning of my shift was actually pretty exciting. There was a shoot going on, so there was lots of traffic in and out of the parking lot. I got to direct some traffic, tell some people that they couldn't park there, and occasionally give a random person directions (according to my training, my job was \"customer service\" and everyone I interacted with was a customer. I also just like helping people). \n\nAround 11:30pm, the first \"incident\" happened. I spotted a stereotypical drunk white dudebro (let's call him \"Chad\") walking away with one of the \"No Parking\" signs that we had set up along the curb. \n\nMe: Excuse me sir, would you please put the sign down?\n\nChad: Oh shit!\n\nChad begins to sprint away. Thankfully I notice his two friends (one male, one female) who were trailing a bit behind.\n\nMe: Excuse, your friend just ran off with a no parking sign. Could you please ask him to bring it back?\n\nChad's friends: Oh shit! Run for it!\n\nChad's friends then both proceed to each grab a sign and run away giggling like school girls. I sigh and radio it in to my boss. He tells me to go inform whoever is in charge of the site. I walk over to office/trailer, and who is there but the traumatized location manager from my last story! He recognizes me as I walk over to him, and he seems to be dreading whatever I have to say. I tell him of the theft, and his response is \"fuck it, we rented those, it's not my problem. Thanks for letting me know.\" He has the eyes of a man that has stopped giving a fuck.\n\nI head over to my backpack and start filling out incident reports. There is a surprising amount of drunk hipsters out for a Tuesday night, and there are a lot of people walking past the parking lot. An e-list rapper and his entourage walked past the site no less than 15 times in search of a club that would let their drunk asses in as the kept getting kicked out of clubs (they were bitching very loudly).The excitement did not pick up again until around 3am.\n\nAt this point, the shoot had ended and almost everything had been moved out. There were a few large trailers in the parking lot, and that was it. In one corner there was a small picnic tent and a grill along with some other cooking equipment, but my normal patrol didn't take me around the outside of that area. Out of boredom more than anything else I decided to walk around to the other side of the tent, where I found myself face-to-face with a homeless man that was sitting on the grill.\n\nWe just started at each other for at least 30sec before either of use managed to say anything.\n\nMe: Excuse me sir, I'm going to have to ask you to step off the premises. \n\nHomeless man: NO!\n\nThis was basically the flow of the conversation. The homeless man absolutely refused to do anything I asked. At one point I called for backup, and was told to \"handle it myself because everyone else is busy\". Eventually I convinced the homeless man to get up, and witch point he started walking towards me his his hands in his pockets. He refused to leave the property by the short route, and instead insisted on walking all the way across it. Oh, he was also completely insane amoung other things, he insisted that\n\n- I was not a security guard but a famous actor.\n\n- Me kicking him off the property was a government conspiracy run by aliens.\n\n- He was in fact a little girl named \"Fairy\".\n\nIt took me a solid 10 minutes, but eventually I was able to get rid of him. Immediately after that, a morbidly obese women wearing nothing but a yellow tank top and the largest adult diaper known to man rolled by on a scooter.\n\nThen my relief showed up two hours early because scheduling had fucked up again. \n\nThen one of my female coworkers needed my help covering her area for awhile as there was a homeless man across the street from her that had been staring at her and masturbating for over an hour.\n\nI didn't even realize it at the time, but that night might take the cake for most weird shit seen in a single shift. Thankfully, I never had to guard that parking lot again.\n",

        "text": "My first \"week\" on the job was only two days, as I finished orientation on Wednesday, and was scheduled for graveyard shifts starting Thursday and Friday night. I do not have a car, and as the day shift started to early for me to take the bus, and the swing shift ended too late for that, graveyard was my only option. \n\nMy first night on the job was pretty uneventful. One guy didn't show up for his shift, so one of my coworkers ended up working a double (16 hours in a row). I later found out that that guy was sent to a site 45min away because the dude in scheduling fucked up (a common occurrence), and had quit on the spot after showing up at an empty parking lot and being told he had to drive for almost an hour to get to the actual site.\n\nIt was the second night where shit got exciting. I had been assigned to the set of a TV show that shot locally, and I ended up guarding the prop cars because someone in props thought it was a good idea to leave the keys in the wheel well. I spent the first few hours of my shift eating some food my boss had brought me from the catering tent and telling people not to park on the block. About two hours into my shift, I smelled weed. The set and the prop cars were separated by a small park that was left open to the general public during shooting (the show wanted to maintain a good reputation with the public), and so I started looking for smoker because I though the site manager would probably be pissed if there was someone doing drugs so close to the set. I looked all over the park and I just could not find the guy. Eventually I radioed my boss about the situation, and he said he would come over and give me a hand. \n\nAnother ten minutes past, and he couldn't find the source of the smell either. Then the wind picked up, blowing towards us from the set. We looked over, and then it hit us: it wasn't anyone in the park. It was a crew on the set, blazing it while the cast took a meal break. \n\nThe next few hours were uneventful. Shooting wrapped around 1am, and the crew had finished carting most of the equipment away by 2am. There were a few stacks of electronics left for the morning crew, but aside from that everything was pretty much done. It was at this point that I saw a large black man that was not part of the crew putting something on top of one of the equipment stacks. I walked over to him.\n\nMe: Excuse me sir, could you please step away from the equipment? It's very delicate and my boss would kill me if it got damaged\". (Side note: my immediate superior was a chill bro and pretty much the only part of the job I liked. Seriously a good dude).\n\nLarge black man: I'M TRYING TO DO COCAINE OVER HERE!\n\nAt this point I should probably mention that I am not a large person. Think 5'7\" and 135lbs at most. On top of that, I hadn't been able to go to Judo or Muay Thai or lift more then 10lbs for a good chunk of the previous two months due to my appendectomy, so I was feeling even weaker than normal. I was still going to do my job though.\n\nMe: Sir, I understand that, I would just appreciate it if you didn't do it on top of the equipment.\n\nLarge black man: MOTHERFUCKER THIS COCAINE WAS EXPENSIVE MAN!\n\nHe then proceeds to wave a brown paper sandwich bag full of crack rocks at me. At this point my mind beings to crack. Part of me is terrified, part of wants to burst out into hysterical laughter, and the rest of me is not entirely sure this shit is actually real. I press on.\n\nMe: Look, if you don't leave I'm going to have to call for backup and file an incident report. And neither of us wants that.\n\nLarge black man: MOTHERFUCKER WHY YOU GOTTA BOTHER ME MAN.\n\nMe: It's my job.\n\nLarge black man: Fine. I'll take one hit and leave.\n\nMe: Promise?\n\nLarge black man: FUCK MAN, I said I'd go.\n\nThe dude lights up his crack pipe, takes a hit, and true to his word leaves.\n\nI breathe a massive sigh of relief. Then I noticed that both my boss and the location manager for the show had been standing on the curb 15ft away. Both had this thousand yard stare. I turned to my boss and asked if it got any worse then this. His response was something to the effect of \"Thankfully no.\"\n\nAfter that, the location manager came over and told me that \"I know we are paying you to protect this stuff, but it's all insured and not worth getting shanked over.\"\n\nAnd that was when I realized that I wasn't getting paid enough for this shit. Did I do the smart thing and quit? Of course not. I needed the work, and I had spent around $200 on training and transportation just to get the job at that point. I needed to at least recoup that with interest before I move on.\n\nTL;DR Film crews are full of stoners and you can in fact negotiate with crackheads.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nMy adventures continue: http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/2sfo4i/octopus_in_security_at_the_parking_lot_of_madness/",

I also applied for work at every single fast food place and convenience store within 10 miles of my house, but the security company was the first to call me back.\n\nI thought I was fucking awful in the interview, so I was shocked when I was immediately offered a job. Since I had traveled to another state for the interview and I was desperate for work, I accepted. Of course within 48 hours of signing, I got three calls for interviews from other places I applied at. Fate has a sick sense of humor.\n\nAfter signing the papers I had to take a drug test that used saliva rather then urine. I would later learn from a coworker that it didn't work as he had passed his while baked as fuck, but at the time I was a bit nervous as I was still recovering from getting my appendix out so I was concerned about opiates showing up (I had been off them for two weeks at that point, but I didn't know how long you could test for them). I passed the test, so I was told to come in for training on the following Monday.\n\nTraining was interesting and boring at the same time. I was the youngest person in the room by half a decade. One dude there was pushing 60. On top of that, I instantly understood how I got the job. The hiring standards were low. Really low. Some of the people there could barely read.\n\nAfter the first two days of training that I had to pay for, I had to wait another week for orientation because my background check hadn't cleared yet. After that, I was scheduled for my first shift.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nEdit: And the next one is live: http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/2sbb3c/octopus_in_security_the_first_week/",

I was coming on shift when I heard a call from our ED for a code grey in one of the unsecured bays . Wasn't my assignment but I was full of piss and vinegar at the start of shift and had no Pts in the secured bays so I decided I’d go see what the fun was.\n\nAs I enter the ED and round the corner to the far row of bays I can start to hear the shouting from the Pt. As I show up to the bay I see the other BHSO, my lead, and an Escambia County Deputy at the bay. So I quickly double back and grab the clear shield from our locker in case we’d have to do a physical intervention.\n\nAs I get back the verbal de-escalation isn’t going so well and you can tell the deputy we had wasn’t a talk-em-down type of LEO. This is the first time I catch site of our Pt and it’s a first timer and he is buck ass naked standing bladed toward the door just screaming profanities at our guys.\n\nThe deputy is getting rather annoyed at this point and drops the line “I'm about off shift and I don't need this shit from you”. This escalates our Pt and he starts screaming back \"You don't need this shit?\" several times before dropping into a squat and defecating into his hand. I immediately drop the clear shield and grab the handle for the bay door slamming it shut just as he lobs his steamy pile of feces in our directions splattering across the glass bay door.\n\nI pick up the clear shield as a couple techs show up to do the physical intervention. Deputy just cracks open the bay door and hit the guy with his taser and he drops like a rock. We are kinda shocked since this was first time they ever used one against a Pt, but our stack rolls in as does our intervention and restrains the Pt to the bed before moving him to the secure bays where later that night he attempted to cover himself in his feces before another physical intervention.\n\nTL;DR –Deputy pisses off Pt, Pt threw shit at us, Pt got tased.",

Good sized building, 7 floors worth of courtrooms, some admin. offices and a few holding cells for those awaiting trial.  The holding cells are where today's tale *really* begins...but I didn't know that just yet.  \nThe first sign of trouble was a call from the 4th floor reporting water leaking into a judges' chambers  [no bueno, they *hate* that].  I informed the JA that I'd have maintenance up there ASAP, as water damage in this climate is no joke.  No sooner had I hung up the phone when the fire alarm started sounding off with its \"this is not a drill\" alert and the display showed sections of the first four floors lighting up like it's Independence Day.  \n \n6isNotANumber: \"Well, *shit*...there goes the morning.\"   \n\nI spent the next couple of hours fielding calls from panicky judges, JA's and baliffs frantically requesting updates, meanwhile I'm trying to track wether or not the building is *actually* on fire [so far, my alarm panel just reports smoke in one isolated area and water **everywhere** below the 4th floor].  My supe has the crew out going room to room looking for anything that resembles fire and I'm in the office trying to simultaneously coordinate the search and calm the tits of everyone else that called [no small task seeing as everyone wants to know *exactly* what's going on **RFN** and I'm still trying to get a handle on things...]   \nThe squad has completed the building check- no fire, but now I'm getting reports that make it sound like a waste pipe broke. WTF?  Black, brackish, obscenely foul smelling water has now infiltrated over a dozen rooms in the building, starting from the 4th floor and going all the way down to the frakkin' lobby.   \n  \n6isNotANumber: *facepalm*  FML.  \n  \nThe BM is up on 4 surveying the damage [and out of cell coverage...I swear this building is actually a goddam Faraday Cage in disguise] when I finally get the call that explains it all...and it's a doozy.    \n  \nTurns out, one of the inmates in the holding cells had managed to get loose from his escort *just* long enough to bust the head off of one of the emergency sprinklers, partially triggering the fire suppression system and flooding the holding cels and [as of my last check] over a dozen *other* rooms as well.    \nHow he did it, I still don't know.      \nWhat I *do* know, is that they just left that fucker in his cell, ankle deep in funk until the cleaning crew finished the rest of the building.   \n  \nIf you live by the funk, you suffer the funk.\n  \nWhat's more, we later came to find out that this isn't the first time he's pulled this stunt [gotta love those repeat offenders!], he's actually done it on at least three previous occasions, one of which ended in a [temporary] escape. [No such luck this time, since both the doors that access the holding cell area were secured - good job, Courthouse Cops! Love those guys.]\n \nOddly enough, I was still receiving reports of a sewage leak from a few locations.  Well, TIL how the internal sprinkler system works.  Apparently, the water used by the system doesn’t circulate through the pipes, it just sits there untill called upon. Occasionally [read: every other year or so] the system gets flushed out and the water is replaced.  Our system hasn't been flushed out [that I'm aware of] in at least 3 or 4 *years*...     \n  \nMy brother D has a word for smells like this - F.A.M.  It stands for Feet, Ass, and Mayonnaise...and, in this instance, it's amazingly apt.\n  \nO my sweet zombie christ....I'm never going to forget that smell...in fact, I can still kinda taste it in the back of my throat....I'm gonna have to gargle some vodka or something when I get home.  \n  \nMoral of the story...well, there is no moral, unless it's \"remember to flush out your sprinklers now and then.\"\n  \nUntill the next annoyance, my friends!   \n",

        "text": "So, I guess this is as good a time as any. Writing this will keep me from working on anything profitable.\nI was...24? 25? Loading trucks, working concert security and going to school very slowly. I had just had my heart broken by a pale girl with a Polish name and was taking it very hard. My co-worker 'U' asked me if I wanted to help work the door at a private birthday party. Had to wear a blazer, full body frisks on men AND women (it was a 15th birthday party and the family had some gang connections, so guns were expected), working from 7 to 12: $100 cash at the end of the night. I said sure, anything to get my mind off the Polish girl. \n\nThe party was at a club in Palms. Back then, Palms was a very dangerous area (it's no great shakes now, but better) of Los Angeles. I looked around and the venue looked good with doors that were easy to cover and a nice foyer for doing checks. U was late, so i smoked and thought about pale skin and soft hips. Then I smoked some more.\n\nU comes roaring up in a sports car. Driving it is a tiny Asian woman with the biggest, darkest, thickest head of hair I'd ever seen. I mean, the hair just kind of moved independently of the rest of her. She turned to me and hit me with a smile. Wow. Great smile, about my age, a bit younger. And then she opens her mouth and with the plummiest British accent I'd ever heard, called 'Take care of my cousin!' and drove off with elan. \nWell.\nWho the hell was that?\nI asked U and it WAS his cousin. His dad had married an Indonesian woman and the families had been combined. I was fascinated - British accents were my Kryptonite- and asked him dozens of questions. She was going to school in the city, had come over with her younger sister, lived in the hills, was hilarious.\nThe party starts and I'm surrounded by drunk Mexican big sisters with their tits hanging out and asses bulging out at me. I'm being offered phone numbers all evening- and I'm just nodding and tucking them away, thinking about- do I even know anything about Indonesia? 'The Year Of Living Dangerously' was one of my favorite movies, but other than that, I was drawing a blank. Asian girls? I'd never even thought about Asian girls. Italians! Mexicans! The perfidious Poles, sure. But I don't think I'd even -\nand then I remembered 'Angel' the Korean girl I'd worked a few stands with. I'd walked her to her car once and she'd asked me to kiss her. She was afraid she was not a good kisser and asked if I would critique her technique. So we leaned aganst her car and made out for a few minutes. She was very grateful for my tips and we had a couple of review sessions after that first time.\n\nOkay, I thought. So I know about Asian chicks, right?\n\nThe evening winds down, we get paid. I ask U what he's doing after. He's going to spend the night at the cousin's house. I ask him for advice on getting to know the cousin. He says I should just come along with him and get something to eat. I thought that was a bit sudden, but U assures me: she'll be up, working on homework and watching TV, 'she never sleeps, man, she's like a vampire', he told me.\n\nWell, God made me with some very big balls and the heart of a lion, so I said sure.\n\nWe get to this house in the dark and it's a very nice house, pool in the back, very nice furniture (I remember noticing how much of it was leather, which to me at the time was inconcievably expensive). And there she is, sure enough, watching TV, doing some artsy homework and singing Stevie Wonder songs at the top of her lungs. She seemed very happy I was there and we chatted while U was changing. She showed me around and I realized that I could see the whole city from her backyard...which meant we were way up in the hills.\n\nU asked if we were hungry and we decided to go to Dennys, her still in her pajamas. We ate and flirted, with U offering up information as we went.\nU crashed hard when we got home. She turned the TV off and we sat and chatted in the dark. I think I brushed her hair back and that was it. We started kissing and ended up lying on a bed in the back of the house. Just kissing and then a few garments came off- but I was very very staunch about not going too far right now this instant; I think that made a good impression. \n\nEventually, I realized that I'd either be spending the night or making a graceful exit. I chose the latter with a lot of kisses at the door. Drove back to the room I rented from a gay alcoholic professor at my college (the house was also shared with 4 Asian exchange students, a HUGE body builder and the professor's boytoy).\n\nI wake up to an early call from U. \n\n'Man, what happened?'\n\n'Uh, I kissed her. Why?'\n\n'Well, you musta done a good job, man. She woke my ass up at 6, wants to know EVERYTHING about you. She gave me a list of questions. I'm not 'sposed to ask them, I'm, like, supposed to get the information out of you in a casual way.'\n\n'Yeah, no, fuck that. Read the list.'\n\nAnd it was all about my likes and dislikes, my past, future plans, etc. I laughed and told the truth. I was really into climbing rocks back then; it was somewhere below sex and above grades on my priorities then.\n\nLater I got a call from her. WHAT A GREAT ACCENT, I can still hear it now (she went to private school in Singapore, British teachers). She invited me over for dinner. I wore a clean shirt. I brushed my hair. \n\nI got there: she made spaghetti with three kinds of sauce (I guess she really picked up on U saying I was Italian) and a climbing video I'd never even heard of before. We watched it, finished about a tenth of the spaghetti (she made about three pounds of pasta, enough for twelve people!) and then the kissing started and events proceeded and back then, I am just going to say\n\n-I had muscles on muscles from climbing and loading trucks and the gym\n\n-I was remarkably flexible, and\n\n-I hadn't had sex in two weeks.\n\nSo, yeah. I made a good impression. I think I made six of them by the time the sun came up.\n\nAnd let me make this clear. I had NO IDEA she was from money. I was so far out of my depth, I didn't even notice the spare Mercedes in the driveway or the maid she had living with them or the expensive jewelry or the designer clothes. I'd been engaged to another rich girl before this, but it had been kind of a hassle, frankly (wow, and I am not typing that story now, it has nothing to do with working security).\n\nAnd this story has very little to do with working security, does it? But that's where it started. And that's how I ended up living in Jakarta for ten years. That's how I ended up starting my own company and living in a mansion and wearing bespoke suits.  The lesson of the story: if you think you're good enough for a millionaire's daughter,  you are. ",

Honestly can't remember the year, but neither can anybody else who was there.\n\nI was working aisles on second level, checking tickets and directing people to their seats. A Princess approaches me. Spotless tie-died sweats, very Westside bf. Probably heard that seeing the Dead would make her seem cool and would give her a mark to tick on her 'coolness' list.She tries to push past me with her hands full of drinks and refusing to show me her ticket. i stop her and that unleashes a flood of complaints: 'Oh, you think you're important, like I couldn't afford to sit here or something?' I smile and demand her ticket. When I see she's int the right section, of course, I smile and apologize. Complaining continues and gets a bit shrill. I ignore her.\n\nShe ended up getting up four more times for beer and I was consistelntly professional, asking for her stub. It got to be a game. I guess the sweats did it: tie-dye shouldn't be that clean. She went wandering off with her bf, glassy-eyed (I guess she dropped whatever was in her purse around the 3rd beer?), berating me to remember her the next tme she comes back,\n\nJust after she lurches away, two country boys come lurching up. High as kites, giggling and smiling and with a twang in their voices that I just had to like. They asked if they could sit down for a bit while they figured out how to move their own legs again. I got a whiff of them: wow. I asked about it. \n\n'Yeah, we've been hitching to get to the Dead shows. We rode all night in the back of a sheep truck.\"\n\nAh, that explains the smell, and the way they were shiny: they'd been rubbing up against filthy, greasy sheep! I smiled. \n\n'Yes, there are two vacant seats right down there. Make yourselves comfortable. I mean, REALLY, relax, rub all over those seats, guys.\"\n\nThey hooted with glee and proceeded to do just that for about ten minutes before I kindly booted them to their nosebleed seats.\n\nPrincess came back, eyes half-closed, sat down- and fairly slid to the ground. As I said, those boys were greasy. She was pretty much shiny when she got up, from her collar to her knees. Never said a word. i bet she had to burn those sweats when she got home.\n\nEDIT: I have to say that at Dead shows, there was a clear dividing line. Deadheads were 99% of the time calm and peaceful and FRIED OUT OF THEIR SKULLS. Just nice folks, taking care of each other and yearning to be with the band. The non-Deadheads, well, they came to point and laugh and snort and see what the fuss was all about. It got to the point where I hated dealing with people unless they were high. Frat boys and sorority girls looking to score acid. Uggh.",

        "text": "During college, mid80s to mid90s, I worked security in southern California. They tried to put me on desks and watching a beach full of volleyball nets, but eventually the company figured out I was good at concerts and the like. I didn't come to work drunk, I didn't take advantage of drunk girls and I wouldn't hit anyone unless it was absolutely necessary. Saw this sub and I'll drop a story here, maybe more.\n\nThe first night I had the job, I worked a Grateful Dead show in Long Beach. The StaffPro crew (us) sat with a bunch of frat boys who had volunteered to 'help out' to make money for the frat. I think it was the second night of the Deads' run there. (I wasn't a big fan, but I ended up working EVERY SINGLE Dead show i could, they were the only band I'd drive a long way to work. The crowds were amazing and you couldn't buy the stories you could tell later)\n\nThe Dead had a security chief who traveled with them and it was his custom to come out and talk to the security team in the arena before the show. He greeted us warmly, then talked about the special challenges we might face that night and how it was always best to be gentle with any fans who might be confused. Guy to the left of me rasies his hand.\n\nSecurity Head: Yes?\n\nGuy To My Left: Last night, there was a guy on the mezz stark naked, running up to things and pissing on them. What should we-\n\nSecurity Head: Ah, yes. What you have to remember is that in a case like that, the person's probably...reverted to an animal consciousness level and is marking his territory. Was he marking people?\n\nGuy To My Left: Well, no, but-\n\nSecurity Head: See, in that case, I'd just keep an eye on him.\n\nThe show itself was...unremarkable. I worked probably 20 of their shows and I'll be danged if I can remember one note of the music. I was watching the crowd, walking the mezzanine. Once I realized that no one was going to hurt anyone else, I relaxed and took it in. I remember seeing a couple, white kid and Asian girl, maybe 18, she was wearing a rather formal dress and he was in a blazer and tie. I have no idea what they had taken, but they had slumped so far down into their seats that I was afraid they'd slide onto the floor.\n\nAfter the show: we're clearing the rows and this 20ish guy is rather feverishly holding onto the backs of the seats and searching for something on the floor. I go over and tap him on the shoulder.\n\nMe: Sorry, but you've got to go, man, the venue's closing up.\n\nKid looks at me in utter panic.\n\nKid: Man, I've got to find my leather jacket! I can't leave without it!\n\nMe: Okay, okay...is this where you were sitting?\n\nKid: i think so.\n\nMe: When do you remember seeing it last?\n\nKid: High school.\n\nAnd with that, I'm guiding him to the doors. I turn and see across the emptying lobby of the arena a kid on a pay-phone. I walk over to advise him that he has to leave, but then i hear the conversation:\n\nKid: It's no good anymore, I wanna come home...No, I tried that and they wouldn't give me any money! I got robbed and I just want to...If I promise to go back to school, i can be good, I can...\n\nAnd I mean, I have a heart, so I let it go on for a few minutes...then I notice- the earpiece for the phone is not connected to the phone, the cable has been ripped clean out. So now HE's gotta go to the door and as I turn from him at the door-\n\nThere's Mister Bunny. He's a little guy, maybe 5 foot 6? Balding, mustache- and dressed head to toe in a pink fur bunny outfit, feet and everything. He had the head pulled back and the ears flopping down his back. He stopped and scowled at me.\n\nMe: Hey, Mister Bunny, you gotta go-\n\nAnd he fairly flips out on me, screaming-\n\nMister Bunny: YOU DON'T TELL MISTER BUNNY WHAT TO DO! MISTER BUNNY DOES WHAT HE WANTS, WHEN HE WANTS, HOW HE WANTS! YOU CAN GO GET FUCKED FOR ALL I-\n\nAnd there came two Long Beach cops; they just grabbed him under the arms and carried him away backwards as he kept pointing at me and yelling.\n\nFun night. Fun job, it changed my life. Ask nice and someday, I'll tell you how I met and married the millionaire's daughter.",

        "text": "I've worked in security for about 4 years now. I've worked in over 30 posts in two states. Here's just a couple of stories from one location. Sorry it's lengthy.\n\n&gt;I worked several shifts at a high-rise multi-million-dollar condo building with some really snooty tenants and friends of tenants. It wasn't my permanent post, but I filled in shifts there often. One of my duties included being posted at the downstairs lobby with a receptionist. This building's management had a very strict parking policy and one day here comes this elderly broad (not a tenant) who carried herself as if her poop smelled like Chanel No.5. You know the type. Anyway, she rolled up in front of the lobby in an immaculate Porsche SUV and just parked it there on the driveway. Parking definitely wasn't allowed there, so when she came into the lobby I let her know \"Good evening, Ma'am. Welcome. I need to inform you that there is no parking allowed in front of the lobby.\" She says, \"Even if it's a Por-sha?\" (yes I know that's the correct German pronunciation, but where I'm from, everyone without their head up their ass says 'porsh.' And this lady wasn't German.) So, feeling like a smart-ass I say, \"Especially if it's a por-sha. And just to let you know the outdoor parking next door to us is reserved by the bank that owns it, and it's checked quite frequently by a third party.\" It really was. No bull spit there. So she gets pissed, tries killing me with her contemptuous glare for a few moments, then storms outside to move her vehicle. When she comes back in, the man she was meeting had already come down the elevator to receive her. I let the guy know what happened and he totally understood, knowing the policy. Ms. Chanel and the man enter one of the elevators to ride up. As they enter she loudly says \"I don't know how you can deal with these fucking low-lives.\" And 'yadda yadda yadda' as the doors were closing. I couldn't hear the rest. I have poor self-esteem. I felt like shit, but whatever. Anyway the juicy part of this story was that she had a heart-attack later that night. I had to call 911 and escort the paramedics up to the 12th floor to have them save her. As far as I know she lived. \n\n&gt; Here's another one taking place at the same high-rise building. Not much of an incident, but a bit of an eye-opener for me. I was foot-patrolling the exterior of the building  and I see this old guy who looked like a bum: old print t-shirt tucked into tattered jeans, and wearing dirty off-brand sneakers. He definitely looked out of place for that area (we weren't the only multi-million-dollar condo building around, there were several.) What's more I witnessed him picking up stuff off the street and dumpster diving around the areas nearby. When I'm back at the lobby I see this same guy approaching the lobby entrance doors. These doors are always locked and you need a fob key or me pressing a button to let you in. The man had his own fob key! Before I get up to ask him where/how he jacked that fob key, the receptionist greets him like the Commander-in-Chief just walked in. I'm flabbergasted, but I keep my mouth shut. The guy greets us with a smile and rides up to the 23rd floor. Apparently, he was one of the richest tenants this building had. According to the receptionist, this guy walks/bikes everywhere and pretty much dumpster dives all day",

        "text": "This was several years back... I was part of a volunteer organization that ran a Haunted House attraction as a major fundraiser. The city said we had to have police there (usually off duty, moonlighting) in case someone needed to be arrested or shot. \n\nSo I'm stuck working my usual spot near one of the entry points of the property as part of our volunteer security force, there's about 8 of us sizeable guys who did this, and we had clear rules of engagement. All of us had worked security in one form or another at some point in the past. For me it was a strip club. Self defense only for a physical altercation (Thank God for Maglites and steel toed boots), and we all had radios to call for the badges to report anything suspicious. We also usually had visual contact with at least one other person. Other than that, we had those ever helpful black shirts with SECURITY screen printed on them.\n\nSo I notice this group coming in, and this guy had a filet knife out, like the kind you use for fish. He's telling his buddies that he's going to pull it on one of the actors in the house and scare them. Again, I'm 6'2\" and about 280, in a reasonably well lit area, with a SECURITY shirt on, and they walk right past me doing this.\n\nNow, I'm not going to take on 4 guys by myself with one known knife in the mix. I wait until they are out of earshot and get on the radio (we had headsets) to report what just happened, gave descriptions, etc. \n\nI watch in amazement as the 6 uniformed officers descend on this bunch with weapons drawn before they can reach the ticket booth. I'd never seen that bunch of cops move so fast. Also every other volunteer security guy wanted a piece of the action. \n\nOne guy gets away from the group and starts running my direction. I figure if he was armed he would have showed it by now. I pulled out my Maglite, ready to hit a homerun when he sees me and stops. I circle around a bit and tell him \"I'm just moving out of the way of the bullets in case you don't lay your ass down on the ground right now.\"\n\nNow that I had his complete attention, I got him prone and kneeled right between the shoulder blades with his hands interlaced behind his head. A cop got there a few seconds later to cuff him. \n\nThe officers asked me a bit later what I told him that made him stop, and they laughed like hell. It was a complete bluff, but that asshole didn't know it.\n\nI miss that place sometimes.",

My partner and I were at the locker grabbing our gear for the night and we planned where we were going to watch for the reported activity. \n\nHe climbed on the roof with the night binoculars and I laid down on the freezing cold ground with binoculars behind a bush at a distance to watch the door as people came in and out.\n\nAfter a while of me shivering, I noticed a guy come out and stand at the entrance. He kept stopping people and I saw them shaking their heads \"no.\" Shortly after that, a couple of kids pointed at me in the bush and then up to my partner on the roof. I called on the radio to my partner \"we've been made.\" How they found both of us I don't know but they did. I had no clue if he had a gun or a knife or what. He got on the phone to call someone. I got a tad bit nervous. I switched channels and called on the radio \"someone get those kids out of there, someone get those kids out there, someone get those kids out of there.\" Their mom was inside and soon someone came out and grabbed the kids, gripping their arms hard. They didn't look too happy. I wasn't either.\n\nAfter a few minutes, my partner called on the radio that a car showed up (it was behind a building that I didn't have line-of-sight to). The guy we were watching moved quickly to the car and it took off.\n\nOnce it was clear, my partner and I switched places and I sat up on the roof for a bit. It was a quiet night after that. And the complaints of drug activity stopped as far as I'm aware.",

        "text": "For awhile after college I worked as a security guard through a temp agency. It was pretty easy work, and you have to have a year of security experience before any of the big companies will consider employing you full time. One time I was called out to be a guard at a street fair, where one street was closed off and filled with two rows of vendors. My job was simple: stand near a baricade that blocked off the street and not let anyone drive through. At first I thought this was rather silly, since the street was barricaded with a a large black and yellow crossbeam. And yet...\n\nSUV drives up and parks directly in front of the crossbeam. The driver stares at it for about 30 seconds, the entire time I'm standing in front of it and staring back at him. Driver exits the vehicle, literally walks around me and starts to move the crossbeam.\n\n* Me: \"Sir, the street is closed. You can't go through here.\"\n* Drive(pointing to donut shop on other side of the street): \"But I want to go get donuts.\"\n* Me: \"Sir, there is a parking lot to your left, please park there and walk across, or drive around the fair to the other side.\"\n* Driver: \"I'll be real quick, I promise.\"\n* Me: \"SIR, the street is filled with people. You can't go through here.\"\n* Drive: \"They'll move, I'll go slow.\"\n\nEventually I convinced the driver to park in the parking lot and walk the 300 feet to the doughnut store. I chalk that one up to just a severe caffeine addiction and laugh it off. Just as he's driving off, another vehicle drives up. This one starts honking the horn at me and pointing at the barrier. I walk over to the driver side window.\n\n* Me: \"Can I help you sir?\"\n* Driver: \"Move the damn thing! I'm going through.\"\n* Me; \"The street is closed to traffic. You can go around.\"\n* Driver: (long string of threats and vulgarities).\n\nI casually walk over to the barricade and sit down on it, watching the driver yell and honk his horn at me. He eventually starts gunning his engine (In a car where gunning the engine is NOT intimidating). He eventually throws it into reverse and screeches off, flipping me the bird on the way out.\n\nThe rest of the day is uneventful up until near the end, when the fair is starting to close down as the fair is \"open\" until 6PM (as best I can remember). Someone drives up to the barricade at 5:55 and sits there staring at me.\n\n* Me: \"Can I help you ma'am?\"\n* Driver: \"They're not allowed to be here past six! Move the thing!\"\n* Me: \"Ma'am, the barricade will remain in place until the city removes it.\"\n* Driver: \"The fair is over at six so I am driving through here at six! If I hit something it's your fault!\"\n* Me: \"I understand ma'am, let me get on the radio to sort this out.\" I click on my radio and stand behind a large cement planter and speak in a 'presentation' voice to ensure she hears me: \"We've got a (color, make and model) sedan at the (streets) intersection, driver says that she plans to drive through the fair in five minutes even if people are still there. Requesting assistance. License plate (number), driver is a (description).\"\n\nAt this point the driver starts screaming at me from her window \"He's lying! He's lying!\" over and over, about a dozen times with increasing scream in her voice. As a police officer starts approaching the barricade from the fair side, she actually tries to make a run for it! She tries to make a sharp turn to turn around, clips a light pole and a bench on the sidewalk, and zooms towards the next intersection. The police officer gets on his radio and calls it in, and I hear sirens in the distance. They didn't need my statement since the officer saw the person do the hit and run. I didn't volunteer for fairs after that.",

The boss knows he doesn't. Our FOB keys show time stamps of our comings and goings during patrol. The shifts he works has enormous gaps of time showing no movement on his part whatsoever.\n\nMidway through a shift he'll go upstairs into the administrative offices. Sometimes he naps. Sometimes he sets up a video game system and plays games all night. Sometimes his girlfriend shows up and the two of them vanish for a few hours, most likely fucking in the conference rooms. Numerous times he's left a mess of pizza boxes and trash in people's offices for them to find the next morning. \n\nAnd the best part is you never know if he's actually going to show up for his goddamn shift. \n\nSometimes he simply doesn't show. No explanation. No heads up. His usual MO, however, is to wait until 3am the night before he's supposed to show. Then our phone will ring and some *friend of Bobby's* will be on the line who will state that one of Bobby's relatives is in the hospital and Bobby is at the hospital right now, and therefore he will be unable to come to work today. \n\nBobby's Grandfather has died 3 times this year. His grandmother has died twice so far, and then somehow been in the hospital post-posthumously several times. \n\nBobby never has the guts to make the call himself. Sometimes he forgets whether it's his Grandmother or Grandfather that's supposedly in the hospital. \n\nOver Thanksgiving his Grandfather died... again. He called off and I got called in. I saw him two days later after the supposed funeral (which was in *none* of the papers) I asked him how he was doing. He gave me a surprised look and said \"Huh? I'm fine. Why?\"\n\n\"Um, your grandparent just died.\"\n\n\"OOooh, yeah. That. Yeah, it's cool. Me and grandma weren't close.\"\n\n\"I thought it was your grandpa.\"\n\n\"Yeah, him either...by the way, I'm leaving early today to go to Denny's with my family. I hope that's cool...\"\n\nuh huh. Denny's with your family at 8pm... makes perfect sense.\n\nTonight at 3am our phone rings. It's another friend of Bobby's. Apparently another family member is in the hospital. Gee golly, he won't be able to make it in tomorrow morning (three hours from now)\n\nThe guy who called sounded stoned off his ass. Not a doubt in my mind that Bobby is sitting right next to him on a couch somewhere. We told the *friend* to have Bobby call in himself. \n\nTwo minutes later the phone ring. Yup, Bobby. He tells the *exact* same story he told us on Thanksgiving. Apparently his dead grandfather had yet another heart attack. \n\nsonofabitch. \n\nSo now we gotta call in someone on Christmas fucking day because this dipshit isn't responsible enough to cover his shift. Probably out drinking and getting stoned all night.\n\nFuck I hate people...\n\nMerry Christmas everyone. ",

        "text": "I work hotel security. This story is about Crazy Willy. He's a local homeless man who comes into my hotel every now and then. He's a white male in his late 50s, standing a mere 5'6\" tall. He's scrawny, but you can tell he's scrappy. This is the story of my first encounter with him.  \n\nI was off the day before I got to interact with him. He apparently had come into our hotel, and made a B-line to our fancy schmancy restaurant. He entered the dining room and proceeded to scream and give everyone the finger before he left and hopped the fence to our outdoor seating area to do the same. Then he jumps back over and heads on down the street before my coworker could respond (no one called us).  \nThe next day, I was patrolling when an older couple approached me, stating that there was a strange man in the lobby. Apparently they had been reading the paper in the lobby and Crazy Willy crept up behind them, whispering sweet nothings about drinking blood in their ears.  \nBy the time I got to the stairs, I see this guy heading toward the restaurant again and I pursue.  \nWhen I get there, the manager and a server have him stopped. I ask him to come outside with me. The conversation goes like this:  \n\n&gt;Me: sir, I can't allow you to enter our restaurant. Would you mind stepping outside with me to talk?\n&gt;CW: what? Are you having me arrested? Why are you arresting me!?\n&gt;Me: No one's getting arrested, sir. But you aren't allowed back in this restaurant. \n&gt;CW: why not? I'm meeting someone here. \n&gt;Me: do you not remember coming in here yesterday, harassing our customers?  \n\nAfter a few minutes of thinking...\n\n&gt;CW: ooooh, that was my brother. He's my twin. \n&gt;Me: yeah, and I was born yesterday. You need to come outside with me right away, or else you'll have to explain this to the police.  \n\nAfter this, he follows me through the lobby, talking to himself. Once we get outside, he gets right up in my face and says,\n\n&gt;CW: are you a Christian or a catholic?\n&gt;Me: (reaching for the pepper spray) That doesn't matter. You still need to leave.\n&gt;CW: it's in your blood, missy. I can smell it on you. That's why you a burned bitch!\n   \nCrazy willy then proceeds to dance across the street in front of traffic spouting shit about Jesus eating babies, etc. \nit was hands down my favorite encounter with a homeless person ever. And I've been fired by the Queen of England. \n\nLater, we found out that the shelter across the street for mentally ill adults called the cops on him for trying to break in. Turns out that Crazy Willy is even too crazy for this shelter. \n\nEDIT: I left one detail out about Crazy Willie. He also has a tendency to fire invisible arrows at people. And he recently invested in an imaginary shotgun. One day we watched him slay a dragon in the middle of the street. It was pretty impressive. We clapped, he took a bow, and ran on down the street. ",
