A campaign promise that can be checked off? \n\nSome 40 million people are overwhelmed with student loan debt, especially the interest part of the loan. Some have been paying for years, only to see their loan increase. \n\nThis is stopping a lot of young families from moving on with their lives, buying a home, etc. \n\nWhat more can Biden do as president to tackle student loan debt or is everything from here on up to congress to do something about it?",

But almost all politicians will say this until they’re ready to change their mind. Then, the world will act shocked. \n\nBiden has a stellar record to run on, if he so chooses to run again. But it’s March 2023, and it’s still super early to announce either way if he will run or not. \n\nSenator Chris Murphy, who’s usually a cordial and reserved senator always seeking to “work with those on the other side”, has come out swinging against republicans on their apathy over gun control. A senator like that doesn’t all of a sudden make waves without some reason to do so. Maybe he’s planning on running for president, maybe he’s not, we’ll see with time. \n\nThe age debate has been discussed to ad nauseam. I don’t know if that will be a deciding factor in whether Biden runs again or not. But there’s a million other reasons Biden may decide not to run again. \n\nWhat do you think? Do you think President Biden will run for a second term or bow out and pass the torch to someone else in the party?",
