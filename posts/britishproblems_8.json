Pressed the button and waited. Next along in the queue was a porter pushing an elderly lady in a wheelchair. And the queue really quickly built up behind us.\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that I typically rarely have much common sense, but today my common sense and general etiquette was to let the porter and the elderly lady into the lift before myself. \n\nI thought that would be anybody’s logic. But obviously not. Everybody who turned up afterwards piled in before us not really leaving much room for the wheelchair.\n\nI get a hospital environment is a pretty rushed place but I just couldn’t get over how rude most of those people were.
