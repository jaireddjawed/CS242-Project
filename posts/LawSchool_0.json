I have a 2:1 honours degree from a great conservatoire (top 10 in the world, 10% acceptance rate, ranked highest in its category by the Guardian etc etc) so am looking for a Masters conversion to then possibly go on to a PhD, and potentially a career in entertainment law. \n\nThis is a big jump for me and a totally new field so any advice is welcome! So far I‚Äôve looked at Kings College London, BPP, University of Law, UCL‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd really appreciate some ‚Äúinsider‚Äù knowledge on pros and cons of each of these, in particular which are most respected in the field, how to go about funding, apprenticeship/exams etc, any advice really! \n\nMany thanks all",

My firm just sent us a timeline for our summer, and there are several events scheduled that will bring all the summers together in the same office. However, all of these events will be in their east coast offices. One of these events is scheduled for the last week of our summer program. The event starts and ends before the week is over, so I'm imagining we'd fly back on the last day of the event and do the last couple of days of our program in our main office. I'm originally from the east coast, and I was planning to fly out to visit my family after my summer program ended, but given that we have required SA events on the east coast during my last week, would it be weird (or uncalled for) if I asked if I could just stay on the east coast to finish the rest of the week/program out (it would literally be two maybe three days)?",

        "text": "Hello, I‚Äôm not a law student but my GF is. \n\nShe‚Äôs currently a 1L and is (obviously) super busy all of the time. In her first semester I had a lot of empathy and understanding because it was a massive adjustment for her, even though I felt that my needs weren‚Äôt being completely met in the relationship. I brought this up to her and she acknowledged that, and said she‚Äôd do her best to prioritize me. A few months later, she‚Äôs still really busy, so I only see her once a week or twice if I‚Äôm lucky. I recently brought up to her again that I‚Äôm feeling a bit neglected, but this time she basically said that she can‚Äôt do much to change how often she sees me. \n\nI have had a sinking feeling in my chest over the past couple weeks that this is just what I have to deal with as her partner, because law school takes priority‚Äîand if I can‚Äôt handle it then we should break up. In our recent talk I floated the idea of maybe doing one less extracurricular (she‚Äôs currently doing 6 extracurricular, including mock trial), but she shot that down immediately, saying that she won‚Äôt drop anything to prioritize me more‚Äîwhich I understand to a certain extent, but it didn‚Äôt feel good to hear.\n\nShe has an internship over the summer across the country, so we‚Äôll be long distance for that period, so we won‚Äôt really be able to make up for lost time over the summer.\n\nI have very little confidence that our relationship will make it through 2L with things as they are currently, so I figured I‚Äôd come here for advice. \n\nQuestions for you all: Will things only get worse in 2L? If I can‚Äôt handle being a low priority for 1L should I just end things sooner before it becomes more painful than it already is?\n\nI love her more than I have anyone in my life and a few months ago I could see myself marrying her later on, but the relationship doesn‚Äôt feel sustainable as things currently are. I understand that she‚Äôs prioritizing school which is the best for her future but it seems that she can‚Äôt make more time for me, and my needs in the relationship just aren‚Äôt being met.\n\nIf you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you for reading. This has been weighing on me heavily so I wanted to get some advice from the perspective of law students. Thank you!",

I'll be graduating in the bottom 25% of my class with exactly a 3.0, possibly 3.1. On the one hand, I took the bar review course my school offers and I did fine, and I have an unofficial job offer in the public interest area I always wanted (they've never asked to see grades but don't make official offers without bar results), and I don't have any debt. But on the other hand, every time I think about my class rank I just feel ashamed and inadequate. I can't shake the feeling that I let everyone down, even though I never told my family how poorly I did during 1L. When I look around the office, I feel like everyone else is so much smarter and more accomplished than me because there's a 75% chance they did a lot better in school.

I already have two options in Italy (University of Bologna and Bocconi in Milan) and one option in Spain (Universitat Pompeu Fabra).\n\nThe university of Bologna is among the best in Italy and the law faculty offers a wide range of high-quality courses. On the other hand, Bocconi is the best Italian university in economics, and I'm particularly interested in the economic analysis of law, which is a field that Bocconi is well-known for. Plus, Milan seems to be an amazing city.\n\nHowever, I am a bit hesitant about Bocconi since the law program is relatively new. I'm not sure if it will be as comprehensive or well-established as the law programs at other universities. Nevertheless, I'm still inclined towards Bocconi due to its excellent reputation in economics and social sciences.\n\nI am also considering Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, which has a respected law faculty and an ideal location to explore the city. I‚Äôd rather live in Barcelona than in Milan or in Bologna. Besides, Pompeu Fabra is very recognized for its focus on economics and econometrics, and I would be able to attend classes of a dual degree program in Law and Economics. However, the University is not as recognized as Bocconi or Bologna.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of each university? What are the important things to consider when choosing between these options?\n\nThank you so much in advance for your help!",

        "text": "This is a question for all the experienced mooters out there. I'm including a link to a mooting scenario below. This took place at a UK university. It's a contract law moot surrounding promissory estoppel. Please give the scenario a quick read. But if you want a run-down, it concerns promissory estoppel where there was no contract to begin with. \n\nI was a respondent, representing the party who wanted to do the estopping. In the scenario, the only case referenced as an authority is Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1988). It's very helpful for the respondents, because it's a scenario where a party was estopped without a pre-existing contractual relationship. But it's an Australian case. \n\nI made the foolish decision of making this authority quite integral to our argument for the first ground. When it was my turn to step up to the podium, I was asked about why I was including an authority from Australia. I had an answered prepared basically saying that Australia is in the commonwealth and the law there operates similarly and while this case may not be binding on the UK court, it is highly persuasive. The judge told me he didn't care and that he didn't want me to use the authority. He only wanted to hear UK authorities.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, it only went downhill from there. I did have some UK authorities, but in those cases pre-contractual relationships existed. The judge wouldn't even hear my second submission and that was that. I needed the Walton case. \n\nSo my question is, if you were given this scenario and put on the respondents side and were told that you were not allowed to use Walton as an authority, what approach would you take? You can only cite UK cases. Because I'm completely lost and my two weeks of prep for this were pointless. \n\nKeep in mind, I am a first year student, so perhaps this is just my inexperience showing through. I know mooting is just as much presentation as it is substance. \n\nAny thoughts on the matter would be much appreciated. \n\nThank you. \n\nThe mooting scenario: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zs0nRzikVZOraHJWmoqoNOAVFj7V2dtJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zs0nRzikVZOraHJWmoqoNOAVFj7V2dtJ/view?usp=sharing)",
