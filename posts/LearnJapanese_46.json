        "text": "I posted this just now, but realized the original post was deleted.  I thought it was a useful discussion though: \n\nI was also taught when you enter to say しつれいします when entering and when leaving say しつれいしました、but when I moved to Japan I realized it’s not so black and white.  I decided to ask my wife (my wife is Japanese but I try to be very judicious about what/how many Japanese questions I ask her) to explain to me a bit more.  Here is my report:  If you are at your own workplace, you should say おはようございます when arriving and しつれいします when leaving for the day, the idea here being you are being rude for leaving when the your coworkers still remain at work.  I used to work at an Elementary school, and we would get a daily visit at the teacher’s room from the Yakult saleswoman.  She would say しつれいします when entering and しつれいしました when leaving, as this is viewed as more of an interruption of the work environment.  So the children would also say this when entering/leaving the teacher’s room.  You often hear しつれいします before people hang up on a phone call.  This is kind of like a polite way to say “well, I should be going now.”  I was also confused about things like a doctor visit.  Do I say おはようございます、or do I say しつれいします？Saying both seems like kind of a mouthful.   My wife said a variety of greetings would be natural here, so it sounds like it’s kind of a grey area even for native speakers.",

If it is the later, then it is gonna take ages since I search in Jisho and Google TL to learn the meaning and pronunciation. However, I do learn the core2k\\6k with pronunciation but without remembering the kanjis in it.\n\nPlease state your opinion on this.\n\nRegards!",

I would just like to get a clearer picture of what kind of goal I'm pursuing here.\n\nSpecifically, I want to know how people who passed these JLPT tests fare in the skills not tested by the JLPT, i.e., writing &amp; speaking. For example, would a person who has passed the N2 be able to write, say, an opinion piece? Would she be able to engage in daily conversations with no problem? \n\nI ask this in the context of having learned English as a second language. My experience was that writing skills came naturally when I was able to read well. However, speaking (especially in spontaneous settings) seemed to be an entirely different beast as it requires instantaneous comprehension of the interlocutor's speech PLUS instantaneous articulation of thoughts in a grammatically felicitous manner. It took me way longer to be able to confidently converse in English than to read and write it well. Should I expect a comparable situation for Japanese here? What have your experiences been like? よろしくお願いします。",

Since then, over a thousand people have downloaded it and a few have contributed code to the [Github repository](https://github.com/Pikamander2/japanese-characters). The updates include being able to change the number of answer choices and adding yōon like キャ, as well as some clearer feedback after picking a right or wrong answer.\n\nWith the start of a new school semester, I thought it would be nice to make a follow-up post. [Here's the link to it on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikamander2.japanesequiz), if anyone's interested. The app is completely free and open-source, has no ads, and doesn't require any permissions. It's also only 1.9M in size.\n\nIf you have any problems running the app or find any errors, please let me know and I'll try to fix them ASAP.",

From my understanding, the sentence means \"while doing X, I remembered various things\". I'm not sure why rowing a boat would cause anyone to remember more things than if they sat on a sofa or rode a train. Is this a disconnect in meaning or are there certain situations that aren't used with this grammar?\n\n2.（　　）たばこを吸わないでよ。\na. 歩いて\nb. 歩きつつ\nc. 歩きながら\n\nThe book lists the correct answer as C; I chose B. As far as I've found online and in the book, つつ and ながら serve the same function, so why is one more appropriate than the other?\n\n3. マンションを買うときは実際に（　　）、心配だ。\na. 見た上で\nb. 見て以来\nc. 見てからでないと\n\nThe book lists the correct answer as C; I chose B. The only examples I've found of this grammar point (online and in the book) include a negative clause at the end. From my understanding, the meaning of the grammar point is \"unless X is done, Y cannot occur\", so I'm having a difficult time understanding how this is being used with a non-negative clause and also understanding the meaning of this sentence.\n\nThank you so much for any help you can provide!\n\n",

It then takes your built word and then looks up the Jisho.org definition so the user doesn't have to leave the app to look up the built word.\n\nIf you wanted to look up the word 一網打尽, you could take the following actions\n\n1. Type in \"一”　into built word to start the chained query\n2. Look up 'hawser' (RTK1 Keyword) and click 'Add '網' to built word.'\n3. Look up 'utsu' or ’うつ’, click on 'Add 打つ to built word.' and delete the つ\n4. You can click on 'Search built word' at this point and the underlying Jisho.org API will complete the kanji compound for you if it's well known and defined in its dictionary.\n\nThere are multiple ways to lookup a word, but so far these tools allow the user to improvise and use whatever method they'd like depending on how much of the compound they already know.\n\nHiyoko Jisho is built on top of the Official Unofficial Jisho API, so all dictionary search results will be from [jisho.org](https://jisho.org). It doesn't have support for Jisho's awesome sentence parser yet, but you can at least look up the meaning of your kanji compounds.\n\n I've been using this app myself for a couple of months now and it has sped up my dictionary lookup times for kanji compounds  greatly and I wanted to share this with the community.\n\nAs a note, I have finished RTK 1 and 3 and am working through thecite's RTK4 , which are all covered by this application. I find that the further I get in my RTK studies the more useful this application becomes. I've also passed the N2 last year if you wanted a rough idea of who this is aimed towards, but I'm sure any learner could find a use for this application.\n\nI am currently using Hiyoko Jisho to get through some relatively tough-to-read games (碧の軌跡 and 閃の軌跡３) and it has been extremely useful for me thus far.\n\nI don't intend on monetizing this as long as jisho doesn't monetize their app, so it'll remain free for as long as possible.\n\n  \nHiyoko Jisho already meets my needs for kanji lookups and I am now sharing it purely so I can source ideas for how I can improve and expand it. Feel free to tear apart the app and let me know what needs to be fixed! \n\n(Note: I received permission from [LordQuorad](https://www.reddit.com/user/LordQuorad) to post this.)\n\n  \n",

In every Exercise section of Tae Kim he introduces a list of Kanji (along with vocab using those Kanji) that will be used throughout the exercise. I find learning the Kanji symbol and meaning to be pretty easy, my problem lies in that a lot of these Kanji (especially the beginner ones) have so many Onyomi and Kunyomi readings that it is hard to keep track of them all. I am fully aware that eventually I will have to know them all but at my level my question is this: \n\n\"When trying to learn new Kanji and vocab is it important to learn all(or as many as possible) of the kun and on readings as and when the Kanji are introduced? Or can you simply learn the symbol as well as the kun and on readings based on the vocab in that section and slowly accumulate readings? Is this a strategy that won't lead to problems in the future?\" \n\nA general answer is greatly appreciated but if anyone has used Tae Kim, then a specific Tae Kim answer would be fantastic! Also if anyone has any suggestions on invaluable learning resources to use then I would greatly appreciate that as well!",

        "text": "I'm still very early in my learning journey and recently got KKLC to start working on kanji. My approach has been to use an Anki deck where each book entry gets a card for the kanji core meaning and one or two vocab cards for its real usage and reading. I mark answers with *hard/good/easy* depending on answer time and with *again* if I get the meaning or reading wrong.\n\nThe first few weeks were fine but now I'm regularly having trouble remembering readings for vocab cards. I'll get it fine a few times in a row and then the longer wait until the next review will make me forget it, sometimes completely. Just yesterday I got my first leech (本日 which I keep remembering as ほんにち instead of ほんじつ) and I'm not even 100 entries in.\n\nMy first learning milestone is to be able to read something simple like Chi's Sweet Home or よつばと! without struggling too much and since remembering the meanings is usually not a problem at all, I've been considering just ignoring readings for now. This feels a bit counterproductive in the long run though, since I'm guessing this would severly hamper my future listening and speaking ability.\n\nShould I just power through and maybe change some Anki deck settings (which ones?) or is there a better way to handle readings? Would I cripple my future self if I ignored readings now?",

(This Japanese is also strange isn't it haha)}\n\nI knew the phrasing was awkward because I've never heard a Japanese person use 教えれる like that, but I was in a rush and that's what came to me. But then it seems my phrasing was beyond awkward, and like I want to fight??:\n\n***Yuka:*** その日本語変笑笑\n\nケンカ売られてる気分笑笑\n\n入りたかったら入れるよ！が正しい\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe conversation carried out and the night went good, but I'm a little baffled. I don't want to come across like I want to fight my friends! Please help my shitty nihongoes",

If that's right, 運転しながら音楽を聞きます。would mean, that a person only listens to music when driving a car, is that correct? \nAnd how often is this grammar used in real japanese? \n\nthank you in advance for your answer(s)! :)",
