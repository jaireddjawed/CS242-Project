And what is so special about the moving observer?\nI can easily imagine another scenario: one observer standing still on a train station, the other observer is also stationary, standing in some distance away. When the two lightnings strike, the first one sees them simultaneously, because they are the same distance from him, but the other observer first sees the lightning closer to him, then the further one. \nSo, for the second observer, the events happened at different times, even though he was NOT moving. \nSo what is so special with Einstein’s experiment?\nOf course, I miss something, what do I miss?",

Say for an object in empty space When space time is flat the geodesic path is simply a straight line on the time axis. \n\nThe existence of a mass causes space time to become curved this curvature causes the the straight line on time axis to deviate onto the x y z axis, thus causing the object to move towards the mass. The curvature is also why time ticks different on different altitude, because the grid for each time box that correspond to each space box is different at different radius from the mass.\n\nI have come across a few YouTube videos that says that gravitational time dilation is the reason why objects fall to ground. I don’t really understand that well \n\nAnd then there’s this YouTube channel named dialect, that says gravity is the wrapping of space time kinda like a sinkhole, and spacetime like water.

        "text": " \n\nEd Hartouni and his colleagues at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US found that ions (atoms with a net charge) behave differently in fusion reactions than previously expected. This may bring new insights into the future design of laser fusion energy. The research was recently published in Nature Physics.\n\nIn laser fusion experiments, a laser heats a fuel composed of deuterium and tritium ions (heavier isotopes of hydrogen that have one and two extra neutrons, respectively) to form a plasma from which fusion reactions take place between the ions. The energy from this reaction heats the fuel to a higher temperature, which creates more reactions, leading to a runaway process (thermonuclear combustion).\n\nTo further explore these reactions in burning plasmas, Ed Hartouni of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and colleagues measured the temperature of deuterium and tritium ions by analyzing the distribution of neutrons produced in fusion reactions. They observed many more ions with higher energies than past experiments with non-burning plasmas. They think this shows that the plasma behaves differently when thermonuclear combustion begins.\n\nThe realization of burning plasma is not only an important step in the long road towards fusion energy, but also opens the way to investigate unexplored conditions of matter. The results are sometimes unexpected.",

We could keep going, breaking atomic shells down and then breaking down the very elementary particles they're composed of. \n\nMy logic is that for any piece of matter, it must either have a non infinite density, and thus can be rearranged piece-wise into a smaller space, or it is infinitely dense, and thus has infinitely small volume (which would contribute to our task). The only limit is that matter can't occupy the same position in space (i.e. we are not aiming to \"compress\" matter, we are merely cutting everything up and fitting them together in a more space-optimized way). If we had access to infinite energy and time and could operate with infinite precision and certainty, and disregarding repulsive forces such as charges, could we then theoretically fit all of the pieces of the universe within an infinitely small point? Can we break an elementary particle down into smaller pieces with enough energy?",

        "text": "Maybe this is a bit of a philosophical question but I am curious if there already exists an explanation for this or if there is known litterature on this subject.\n\nSay I ask a question: when I turn on a lamp, why does it emit light? I can answer that by stating there is a metal wire in the lamp that gets so hot that it starts emitting light. A next question could be: why does the metal wire emit light once it gets hot. The answer would be because some things happen on the molecular level that causes the metal to emit light.\n\nThis can be generalised. I can ask: \"why A?\" and you can answer: \"because of B\". Then I ask why \"B\" and you can answer \"because of C\", etc. With each question we go a level deeper and we get a certain question and answer chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C\n\nNow obviously we dont have the answer to everything yet. However, we can assume that there is some scientific explanation for a lot of these observations, we just haven't found the answer yet but theoretically we could find the answer in the future.\n\nNow for each answer I can ask a new question resulting in a ever lasting question and answer chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D... However.... does this chain ever stop? Is there ever a question for which no scientific explanation exists? Are there questions for which it is impossible to find an scientific explanation even when given unlimited time to find one? \n\n\nBecause if this weren't the case, it could mean two things:\n\n1. There is a loop somewhere in the question and answer chain. There is literal circle reasoning going on at a fundamental level of our universe.\n\n2. The chain is infinite. Which I think is very hard to wrap my head around. Properties of a material can be explained by its molecules. Properties of the molecules can be explained by its atoms, etc. Each step we go to a smaller physical scale. If the chain is infinite it also seems objects can get infinitely small.\n\nAssuming if the chain is not infinite and there are some fundamental truths of our universe, do you think we have already found some? Like the speed of light? Or the planck length?\n\nLet me know what you guys think",

I am feeling stuck after researching on the internet for hours, and hoping you guys could help me. I am trying to understand how the asymmetric help the ball fly straight.\n\nOn the website, it written that it is due to two main factors, a lower lift and an  preferred spin axis. I understand that with a different weight repartition, the ball will spin in the prefered spin axis. However, I don't understand why the dimple distribution helps to lower lift in the ball when it spins in the prefered spin axis. I also don't get why a lower lift is a good thing, since when it is well directed it helps the ball go upwards, so farther.\n\nI have found lots on information on the reason why golf balls have dimples, but very few on asymmetric golf balls. If you understand, please explain this to me or redirect me to content that could help me. Any help would be very appreciated !\n\nThanks",

All but one of these caused optical errors before we built the observatory within budget and expectations,\" said Mike Menzel, Webb's principal mission systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"One of them was higher than our expectations and pre-release models; however, even after this event, our current optics are still twice as good as our requirements.\"\n\n To ensure that all parts of the observatory continue to operate optimally, NASA convened a team of optics and scientists from NASA's Goddard Webb team, telescope mirror manufacturers, the Space Telescope Science Institute, and NASA's Meteoroid Environment. A working group of micrometeoroid experts at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \n\nAfter a thorough analysis, the team concluded that the high-energy impact observed in May was a statistically rare event, both in terms of energy and in hitting a particularly sensitive location on Webb's primary mirror. To minimize future impacts of this magnitude, the team decided that future observing programs will be planned to stay out of what is now known as the \"micrometeoroid avoidance zone.\" \n\n \n\n\"A micrometeoroid hitting the head of the mirror (opposite the direction the telescope is moving) has twice the relative velocity and four times the kinetic energy, so avoiding this direction if feasible will help extend the delicate optical performance by decades.\" ,” said Lee Feinberg, component manager for NASA’s Goddard Webb Optical Telescope.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's impossible to observe these regions of the sky, just that it's safer to observe these objects at different times of the year when Webb is at a different location in its orbit. Time-critical observations (such as solar system targets) will still be performed in the micrometeoroid avoidance zone if required. This adjustment to the way Webb's observations are scheduled will have long-term statistical advantages.",

        "text": "Two of the most distant galaxies ever seen are captured in these Webb images of the outer regions of the giant galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These galaxies are not inside the galaxy cluster, but billions of light-years behind it. The galaxy at the top center of the image was extracted from the image on the left. It only existed 450 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy in the bottom center image was extracted from the image on the right. It existed 350 million years after the Big Bang. Both galaxies have been literally seen close in time to the Big Bang, which occurred 13.8 billion years ago. Compared to our Milky Way, these galaxies are tiny, only a few percent of its size, even the unexpectedly elongated one in the top center image. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, T. Treu (UCLA)\n\nJust days after it officially began science operations, the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has brought astronomers into the realm of early galaxies that were previously hidden from view by all other telescopes. Webb has now unveiled a very rich universe in which the first galaxies to form look very different from the mature galaxies we see today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResearchers have discovered two unusually bright galaxies that existed about 300 and 400 million years after the Big Bang, respectively. Their extreme brightness has puzzled astronomers. Young galaxies are converting gas into stars as quickly as possible, and they appear compressed into spheres or disks much smaller than our Milky Way. The beginning of star birth may have occurred just 100 million years after the Big Bang, which occurred 13.8 billion years ago.\n\n\"Everything we see is new. Webb is showing us a very rich universe beyond our imagination,\" said UCLA's Tommaso Truu, a co-investigator on one of the Webb projects. \"Once again, the universe has surprised us. These early galaxies are very unusual in many ways.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe results come from Webb's GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program (Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space) and the Early Release Science Survey of Cosmic Evolution (CEERS). Two research papers led by Marco Castellano of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome, Italy and Rohan Naidu of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian and MIT in Cambridge, MA have been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n \n\nIn just four days of analysis, the researchers spotted two unusually bright galaxies in GLASS-JWST images. These galaxies existed about 450 and 350 million years after the Big Bang (at redshifts of about 10.5 and 12.5, respectively), and future Webb spectroscopy measurements will help confirm this.\n\n\"A few days after Webb released his first data, we were surprised to find the most distant starlight Webb has ever seen,\" said Rohan Naidu of a more distant GLASS galaxy, called GLASS-z12, believed to date back to the Big Bang The next 350 million years. The previous record holder was galaxy GN-z11, which existed 400 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 11.1) and was identified in 2016 by the Hubble and Keck Observatories in the Deep Space Program.\n\n \n\n\"Based on all the predictions, we think we'll have to search much larger spaces to find such galaxies,\" Castellano said.\n\n\"These observations just make your head explode. It's a whole new chapter in astronomy. It's like an archaeological dig, and all of a sudden you find a lost city or something you didn't know about. It's a shock,\" said the fourth The name Paola Santini added to the authors of Castellano et al. GLASS-JWST paper.\n\n \"While the distances of these early sources still need to be confirmed using spectroscopy, their extreme brightness is indeed a mystery that challenges our understanding of galaxy formation,\" said Pascal Oesch of the University of Geneva in Switzerland. \n\nWebb's observations led to a consensus among astronomers that an unusual number of galaxies in the early universe were much brighter than expected. This will make it easier for Webb to discover more early galaxies in subsequent surveys of deep space, the researchers said. \n\n \n\n\"We've identified something really fascinating. These galaxies probably started coming together just 100 million years after the Big Bang. No one expected the Dark Ages to end so early,\" said Garth Illingworth of the University of California Santa Cruz. \"The primordial universe was only one percent of its current age. That's a small amount of time in the 13.8-billion-year evolution of the universe.\"\n\nErica Nelson of the University of Colorado, a member of the Naidu/Oesch team, noted, \"Our team was astounded at being able to measure the shape of these first galaxies; their calm, orderly disks questioned our understanding of how crowded, chaotic the first galaxies were. Formation in galaxies to understand the early universe.\" The disk was discovered so early because Webb's images are much sharper in infrared light than Hubble's.\n\n \n\n\"These galaxies are very different from the Milky Way or other large galaxies that we see around us today,\" Treu said.\n\nIllingworth emphasized that both of the bright galaxies the teams found had a lot of light. One option is that they could be very large, with lots of low-mass stars, like later galaxies, he said. Alternatively, they could be much less massive and consist of a much smaller number of exceptionally bright stars, known as Population III stars.\n\n It has long been theorized that they would be the first stars ever to be born, burning at extremely high temperatures, and consisting only of primordial hydrogen and helium; only later would the stars heat up heavier in their nuclear fusion furnaces Elements. Such extremely hot protostars are not seen in the local universe.",

        "text": " \n\nThe **most extreme objects in the universe** are **black holes**; they are so dense that **not even light can escape its enormous gravitational pull** once it is close enough to it. Now, that distance (more or less close) **varies depending on the mass of the black hole,** and it is what we know as the event horizon.\n\n**When an object crosses the event horizon** boundary, it disappears into the black hole. However, in 1974, the English physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that interruptions in quantum fluctuations caused by the event horizon resulted in a type of radiation very similar to thermal radiation. And **it is something that we could detect** (although now we are unable to).\n\n## But what if we could simulate it in a laboratory?\n\n\"We wanted to use the powerful tools of **condensed matter physics** to test the unattainable physics of these incredible objects: black holes,\" said study author Lotte Mertens, published in the journal *Physical Review Research*.\n\nNow, a team of scientists led by Lotte Mertens of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands has created an artificial black hole in a laboratory setting, and has discovered something astonishing to previous black hole experiments: **that they glow.**\n\nThe physicists created a kind of event horizon that interfered with the wave nature of the electrons, resulting in a temperature rise that matched theoretical expectations for an equivalent black hole system: **they succeeded in generating Hawking radiation.** The resulting Hawking radiation in the lab, particles created by perturbations in quantum fluctuations caused by the black hole's tearing of spacetime, manifested **as a visible glow.**\n\nDespite the lack of real **gravity** in the model system, consideration of this synthetic horizon provides important information about the physics of black holes. While it is not clear what these results mean for quantum gravity, the proposed model offers a way to study the appearance of Hawking radiation **in an environment that is not influenced by the wild dynamics** of black hole formation.\n\n \n\n\"This may open a place to explore fundamental aspects of **quantum mechanics** along with gravity and curved spacetimes in various condensed matter environments,\" the researchers write.\n\nUnderstanding black holes is key to unraveling the most fundamental laws that govern the cosmos, because they **represent the limits of two of the best-tested theories in physics:** the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as a result of deformation (a large scale) of space-time by massive objects, and the theory of quantum mechanics, which describes physics on the smallest length scales.\n\n \n\n## How is a black hole made?\n\n**To make an artificial black hole**, you 'simply' take a series of atoms (green) and vary the ease with which an electron moves between each atomic site (blue in the image). The different binding strength in the lower chain simulates the warping of space-time in the presence of a black hole. In essence, they used a \"chain of atoms in a single file to simulate the event horizon of a black hole.\" In this way, the amazing physics of black holes can be explored in a laboratory on **Earth**. Doing so allowed them to observe the equivalent of what scientists call Hawking radiation, in which particles are born from disturbances that occur due to the black hole's disruption in space-time.",
