        "text": "I am trying to solve a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for a 1D flow (along *Z*\\-axis) with several phases defined by different boundary conditions (their duration is set by the simulation time of the phase).\n\n**I have the following problem**: at the beginning I define initial conditions (constant values) for *t = 0*, which I put in the resulting vector of unknown parameters. Next, I implement boundary conditions for the first phase for *Z = 0* and *Z = L* and execute the ODE solver. The problem is that during time integration, the ODE solver overwrites the boundary values for *Z = 0*, which should remain constant.\n\nAfter looking at the ODE solver in detail, it returns a non-zero values for the time derivatives of the variables for *Z = 0*, thus \"changing\" the boundary values. Arguably, the time derivatives calculation is not done correctly and returns non-zero values for the time derivatives on the *Z = 0* boundary where the values are constant.\n\nTo \"fix\" this error, I have not found a better solution than to overwrite the time derivatives of the variables for *Z = 0*, after the ODE solver function has been computed, to zero values, thus achieving constant values at this boundary throughout all phases.\n\nPrincipally, the algorithm should work by defining the time derivatives only once at the beginning and then changing only the boundary conditions, in my opinion.\n\nWould you please have any recommendations on how to keep the boundary values constant in the ODE solver without overwriting the time derivatives within the run of the algorithm?",

Example: http://imgur.com/hTbWXBm it spins around to bring your groceries to the cashier. Now let’s replace the rubber mat with a mirror\nSo now instead of the black rubber matting bringing your groceries up to the cashier, it is now a mirrored conveyer belt. If you stood above it and looked down you would see a perfect reflection of yourself.\nNow let's say you were able to hypothetically turn up the speed so that the conveyer belt is spinning at the speed of light.\nIf you stood above the spinning mirror and you looked down at the mirrored surface which was spinning at the speed of light, what would you see? How would your reflection look? Would you even see a reflection? Would the reflection be blurred?\nThings to think about: Reflection takes a small amount of time. The time from my eye looking at the conveyor belt, to the image bouncing back to my eye is moving at the speed of light. Since the conveyor belt is moving at the speed of light, would this “shift” my reflection? So many questions...\nTL,DR – Cover conveyor belt with a mirror. Spin it so it’s spinning at the speed of light. Look down at conveyor belt, what do you see",

        "text": "I randomly stumbled upon this [PBS Space Time video about Quantum Immortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTZZUjnrbF8), where they describe a situation similar to Schrodinger's Cat where a scientist enters a box containing 100 particles, and if any of them decay while the scientist is in the box, he will die.\n\nThey go on to say that if the scientist gets out of the box alive, there is a very high chance that Many Worlds is right because the chance of survival in any other interpretation is very small. I don't understand that. Isn't the probability of the scientist being in the branch where he survives exactly the same probability of the scientist surviving if the Copenhagen interpretation was correct? The only difference is that in Copenhagen, those other branches where the scientist survives disappear (well, didn't exist in the first place).\n\n[Sean Carroll on Joe Rogan](https://youtu.be/JJwUd53-dZ8?t=79) also says that Tegmark says this is an argument for Many Worlds, and Wikipedia says 'it can falsify any interpretation of quantum mechanics other than the Everett many-worlds interpretation'.\n\nNow obviously this is a debated topic, but it just seems so obviously false that this is an argument for Many Worlds, I must be missing something?",

We put one electrode in a bowl of water and other one - above water, and watched pretty lightning happen, however one thing puzzled us - the electrode positioned above water (distance to water 0.5cm) creates a dip in the water underneath it. My first thought - ok, water is polar, I could understand that, and if i change polarity, I will get a \"heap\" - but that does not happen! We changed the polarity and we still get a dip under the electrode, not a heap - and I do not know, how to explain what we see. Can anybody help me with the explanation?",

We started the conversation by asking how Dr. Mather became the scientist he is today and go on to discuss the COBE project, the birth, and implementation of the JWST idea, including setbacks and issues that the project had to overcome, and how Dr. Mather felt on the launching day. We heard his personal opinion on some of the common questions like whether is Oumuamua natural, how tough would it be to settle on Mars, how the search for extraterrestrial life will proceed and why he is sure we’ve not made contact yet. We got an insight into what the next NASA telescope will focus on and learned about merging galaxies, habitable zone, potential signs of life forms, quasars, black holes, and many more.\n\n[Link for the full episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5IJ1HpPfZ1TCsdrCc85ctH?si=FafWlLJ9QVu6UmpnZ4CcCQ)",

My subject was related to LHC and, more precisely, to the ATLAS experiment. It was one of the best periods to work on this experiment: LHC working efficiently, a lot of new data from ATLAS to analyse, Higgs boson discovery followed by the Nobel prize. However, after ten years, I can finally say it was the wrong choice to become a good physicist. \"What is a good physicist anyway?\" you would reply. To explain it, I'll say what I've learned and what I wish I had known.  \n\n\n\\- Technical skills. I was on the experimental side. It means my job was to have a question about the detector or the physic and answer it with the data from the experiment. To do so, I had to use programming languages (c++, python) and many standard dev tools like IDE, VCS, and Linux OS. Also, it was data analysis, so a lot of statistics and a bit of machine learning were involved. Today we would say data science, but this term was not yet fashionable. Thanks to this experience, I was a complete developer while I didn't study IT.\n\n\\- Teamwork. ATLAS was something big. More than one thousand physicists at the time. So you had to work in a team. You had to meet your colleagues daily, synchronize the work, present and defend team results, and write papers together. I never was alone working. It has prepared me for remote work since most of my colleagues were from different countries.- Communication skills. Again, daily meetings and presentations with the team have taught me to communicate clearly. Writing papers and reports, teaching students, vulgarisation, and pedagogical presentation are other aspects that make you a great communicator.\n\n\\- Management, or being managed. My PhD advisor was directing and work/results oriented. It means that the how and the why were not so essential, but the results were. I had a weekly meeting with him so he could review my work. He told me if I was doing well or not. He put pressure on me to accelerate or reprioritize things.\n\n  \nOk, I'll stop there. Not bad, right? These are all critical skills for working in any company. I am very comfortable now in most work environments. I have an outstanding job with a good salary. It is a bright side of my life. \n\n  \nSo why, ten years after, do I come to Reddit and complain? Because I always had fuckin' love physics. It is a reason I love life. I think the human species have to understand nature by modeling it. Nature encompasses humanity, and the only fact that society can understand it is a gift. Moreover, human understanding is progressing with each generation, so it is not only a succession of individual contributions but a human achievement. From a human perspective, the History of physics is fascinating. Most of the physicists that have impacted their field had a life that was very inspiring for me. By 17, I read Einstein's biography. So I decided to learn physics. The idea, the methods, and the creativity were what exciting me. It is a way of life.\n\n  \nI'd like to have learned how to properly ask questions about nature and how to formulate them in a precise way. To be not too ambitious but still have exciting questions. To know the concepts to play with them, model or define them formally to construct a good model. More generally, I'd like to learn to start by having a good question rather than a good solution that needed a question. I d like to have learned to build a solution to a particular problem, and to construct it step by step. I also want to find an existing solution by doing a proper bibliography or assisting at conferences. I'd like to learn how to compare answers to problems and identify the best one. All of this is in the context of particle physics. In my Phd, the problems were already settled, the way to answer them was prepared, and the work was to implement the solution the faster as possible.\n\n  \nWhat I had missed is learning to, when you have a new idea, share it with your colleague and convince them of its quality. More generally, to start from a seed of an idea and develop it with a team to a complete solution.  \n\n\nI should develop other teachings that I miss here, but I've been writing this for too long. In conclusion, I learned everything essential to a successful career but didn't learn how to increase our knowledge about nature.",
