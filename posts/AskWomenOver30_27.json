        "text": "I (30f) and my friend (30f) have recently run into some issues that have caused us to stop talking. We use to consider each other best friends and grew up together went to prom together in each other’s wedding for god sakes I was her maid of honour not that long ago. However due to recent events and just life changes we’ve been seeing less and less of each other and in the end just growing distant. I feel shitty about it but half of me is ok to let go and move on and the other half of me wants to reach out and work towards a better friendship. What I want to know is what others assessment of this situation is and if I should just move on and respect that the friendship I once had has run it’s course.\n\n\nSome issues I’ve been faced with her\n\n1. She talks I’ll of all her close friends - calling them fat, idiots, hating on certain life choices they’ve made whether they are introverted or that she hates their husband or just tells me very intimate details about people she’s close with that I feel should be kept personal or are not things you should be judgemental of if they are close friends but then will make posts on Instagram about how much she loves them which has caused me to not really feel safe about what I tell her regarding my life \n\n2. I’m and introvert and she’s an extrovert it’s been an issue our entire lives but had thought she accepted I wasn’t the type that wanted to go party every weekend turns out she’s deeply hurt that I turn down those plans alot\n\n3. I do not like her newish friend group so whenever she invites me out with them I typically decline and it’s caused her to get angry\n\n4. I like most people have a hectic schedule and can only see my close friends once a month or sometimes once every other month and she has the expectation that I see her once a week or every other week and I live outside of the city so taking the train in can be a lot if it’s just for an hour or two \n\n5. We had a big fight because i didn’t stay long enough at her 30th bday - essentially I told her I’d meet her at the bar she was late and when I got there she and her friends were kind of being snooty towards me and she kept making negative comments about me and assured me if I had to. Go home early since I have to get the train home and that itd take me along time its ok to leave well I left and that’s when everything fell apart claiming I was only their for 30 mins when I was there for an hour and I felt like my presence was not wanted so I had plans to have her to my place the next weekend to celebrate her but that didn’t end up happening so we ended up in a huge fight\n\n\n6.  Our last argument was a month ago we met up to resolve things and felt we were on good terms but she continued to be cruel to me about certain things which prevented me from moving forward. The nail in the coffin was that I went out New Year’s Eve to one of my husbands friends parties it was a contentious issue and she hasn’t messaged me since because I typically turn down her parties as I don’t love the group she hangs around (I love her so prefer 1:1s to catch up) \n\n\nThe list goes on and on but when do you know when it’s time to walk away from a friendship and is what I’ve outlined serious enough to perhaps move on?",

        "text": "This woman has been around for a little over a year. She has kind of been a dud since day one, but apparently she hasn't done anything fireable so they keep her around. Also, the last person who was fired sued the organization and while she didn't win she got pretty far, so I think the director is probably hesitant to fire someone else right now.  She's constantly saying really insensitive things, she hasn't learned much about anything in the year she's been there, she's a manager and has generally made things on her team worse, and I don't know anyone in the building who likes her. \n\nI've been able to go for months without crossing paths with her much and only having surface level conversations, but recently we've interacted several times that have just made my blood boil. Last week there was a group meeting where she made a few people pretty mad, but someone else just happened to be worse, so her inappropriate comments are kind of being ignored. I was quiet during the meeting but afterwards when I was in my office my boss came in to ask if I was ok and I did not hold back. I apologized to my boss later and explained my feelings in a more professional and dignified way, but it is VERY clear to my boss that I cannot stand this person, and obviously that's not a good look. \n\nSo who here has some tips and tricks on how to keep calm and cool in the face of someone who you just cannot stand. Especially in the workplace when your natural reactions could negatively affect your future.",

But I actually don't want to climb the ladder and do the BS corporate politics anymore... don't have it in me to be fake and worship stakeholders who treat their workers like machines without feelings\n* Location: I have a great apartment but I'm over living in a tiny box / the stress of city life. I would be happy to move to a cabin in the woods or more reasonably live in a small town\n* Relationships: Those transient, surface level, one-sided friendships have become irrelevant and I want to spend time with family, my dog and build some more intimate connections. I even dread talking to some people these days because it feels very transactional. They're not actually kind or interested in mutual conversation. They just want to vent about their lives and feelings, gossip or say something to gain validation, stroke their ego.\n* Lifestyle: I don't want to buy the latest and greatest whatever it is anymore. I hate going out to bars, restaurants now... Kinda just want to do my hobbies, relax, enjoy the quietness of every day life, go for walks, drink a good cup of tea, bake some cookies, read a book.\n\nI feel like these are such drastic departures from a life that has taken time to build so I'm nervous to make changes. And also don't want to make the wrong choices like swapping one crappy job I don't like for another just for a change, or running to the woods and realizing I'm too isolated. I've had these feeling of my life being lackluster and exhausting for a while now but feel like I almost didn't notice until life slowed down and I thought about the routine instead of being in the routine.\n\nHas anyone felt like this? Did you make major life changes and then love/regret it? Should I just go for it, the whole 'leap and the net will appear'? Should I be wary of all these revelations at once or is this normal 'adulting'?",

I would obviously also help her with keeping the house clean and help her with the kids.\n\nBut you may ask: why i want to marry a traditional woman so much? It's because i grew up in a traditional marriage and i find them to be the best way to have a family and raise kids.\n\nI'm currently working, studying to get a Master in computer science and currently living with my parents (saving up to buy a house)\n\nEvery time i mention that i want a traditional woman i always get called bigoted or something similar.

Needless to say that's completely untrue.\n\nBut after over 6 months of constant search I'm honestly tired of searching and now I'm wondering: how many women would be willing to be housewife and have a traditional family? where should i search to find a traditional woman?",

        "text": "This is something that has been weighing on my mind for awhile and I'd like some perspective.\n\nMy best friend left an abusive common law relationship right before the pandemic. They had been together for 15 years and share a child, but her ex's drug abuse, inability to adult and overall narcissistic behavior drove her over the edge and I talked her into getting out. She did, and seemed to get over him fairly quickly (it was a long time in coming), but the custody situation remains a mess. She never asked for child support or did anything official through the courts. She did a good faith agreement that the ex has been terrible at upholding. Like he can't keep food in his house, brings in questionable roommates (like one who turned into a girlfriend that went after my friend and tried to get her fired from her job), can't keep the kid in clothes, is terrible with money, etc. My friend foots the entire bill while this guy floats in and out like snow. When she told me over brunch one day that his mother has been paying his mortgage while he has been unemployed and doing zero about it, I said \"he needs to get his shit together.\" She snapped back at me and said \"not everyone can be like you!\" And then she indicated that I'm classist. Classist for calling out a guy who comes from more than me that's currently acting like an asshat? No, thank you, ma'am. \n\nA little background: I have known the ex and his family since high school, longer than my friend, and I'm aware of his family situation-alcoholic dad and sweet, controlling, religious mom. My friend comes from a narcissistic family (like NPD level) family and is permanently estranged, but no addiction issues, nothing untoward, They are well-heeled people not afraid to use it against anyone who questions them. Both have run away from their controlling families and I empathize with their individual struggles because I also come from a controlling family, although one without money or community respectability (and now also permanently estranged). She and I had to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, while the ex rejected all family help when he was young because of too many strings (but did land himself a tidy job at one point doing IT for a major university with no degree), although I'm the only one who put myself through several degree programs (and solid career and financial success remain elusive). Ex chose to leave his cush field and never turn back, so it's not like he doesn't have skills. My friend has agonized over that one for a long time. \n\nCircling back to the brunch conversation, I was not looking down on him as a person (he and I are still friends), but rather exhausted by their custody drama and her inability to draw a hard line about his behaviors towards his child and not keeping a reign on his exes (the woman almost got him thrown in jail over a nasty fight and my friend was worrying about that, too.). I also was deeply offended because both the ex and I have had similar successes and I am currently struggling in my own career downturn. He comes from more money and support, but has chosen to be a downwardly mobile bohemian (they both are, actually). I don't have that luxury because there is literally no one to catch me and have a had to make a lot of hard economic decisions to keep myself afloat, decisions that my friend and her ex have not had to make because they have access to greater resources (she has stocks from her parents that allowed her to leave him). But I don't judge them for their chosen socio-economic status or that custody agreements tend to be naturally clunky, I just judge him for being a super bad parent and I'm starting to wonder about her for putting up with it. \n\nI just don't understand her reaction. It caused my gut to sit up and take notice. Why would she defend someone who has treated her so poorly to someone who's been her rock through all of this? Is she still in love with him? Did she just want me to agree with her and worry about his unjustified stupidity, too? Does she secretly like the drama? Does she know anything about me despite being friends for 20 years? How thick is our friendship, really?",

        "text": " I have a lot of uncertainty about my future and I am hoping this community can give me advice--all types welcome. Here are some facts:\n\n\\-I'm 34\n\n\\-I have a degree in interior design from a 4-year accredited school (small school nobody has heard of, though)\n\n\\-I have been working in a retail sales setting for a family-run business for a year\n\n\\-I recently asked for a raise commensurate with my experience--when I first started it was on an extremely part-time basis and I didn't think I would invest much time here, but turns out they really needed me, and still do. They have been trying to hire for 2 roles for months and have had no bites, and my workload has increased, as has my ability to perform.\n\n\\-I was given 1/3rd of the raise I asked for. I make an amount hourly that doesn't cover COL in the area I live in.\n\n\\-I do not have benefits or paid vacation but I am able to take basically as much time off as I want without real repercussions, other than my boss gets kind of pissy about it sometimes.\n\n\\-My boss is kind of a jerk.\n\n\\-I have close to $1mil in investments and liquid because my parents died and I inherited their money.\n\n\\-I don't have any older adults I can really call for advice, unfortunately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis job has been wearing on my mental health because I've realized I don't really want to be in this industry anymore. The hustle is real, and the payoff is low unless you really have a niche style that people are after, and I definitely do not. I got into this industry after my dad got sick and needed to use a wheelchair and I saw how difficult it was for him to get around. I wanted to design spaces for differently-abled people. Then my dad passed, then my mom got sick and I took care of her until she passed 3 years ago. Most of my 20's were spent taking care of sick parents, so the idea of getting into a job where all I'm thinking about is other people who have gotten sick or been injured is kind of depressing.\n\nMy questions is, is it stupid for me to work less hours here, or even possibly quit (or get fired for taking Saturdays off)? I have low self-worth but I feel like not getting the raise was a real slap in the face based on my sales numbers here, plus everything else I do to keep the business afloat. They did not offer commission. I'm just worried that if I start over in another career I'll never make enough to feel like I'm being fairly compensated. I might feel more fulfilled in another job, but I also won't be able to fuck off on vacation for a week anytime I want (most likely). I know I have a nice nest egg, but I worry about getting to 55 and realizing I have to keep working. Of course, I also live my life assuming I could die tomorrow/early because of my dead parent situation, so sometimes the worries about the future are pretty low on my list of concerns. Should I trust the universe? Maybe take some time off for more healing? At least tell my boss I'm not working Saturdays anymore so I don't feel like such a loser not being able to do much on the weekends with my friends?\n\nI need a parent or big sister and I just don't have anyone I feel comfortable talking to about this, mostly because of the whole nest-egg situation.

He has met all my friends and family (who live in another country) and we have spent all xmas + NYE + bdays together. Everything in our relationship is great except for the fact that I haven't met his family or ever been to his house. His excuses are:\n\n1. His family is toxic and he doesn't want me to meet them yet + he doesn't want to spend the little free time he has with his family. He only sees them for coffee about 1-2 times a month.\n2. He's dealing with his ex-girlfriend who is also co-owner of the house and after their messy breakup it is difficult to move out/ make her move out.\n3. He has an extremely stressful and demanding job which is his main reason for it being so difficult for him to make the necessary changes to leave his current house and to organise a good time for me to meet his family (who live in the same city as us).\n\nHe says that she is not living there anymore. That she and him does not want to sell yet because they are worried about losing money from the investment. But he doesn't want me to come over because it's disrespectful to have me over as it is technically still half her house. As me and him have spent all major holidays together for the last two years I believe him when he says they are not together anymore. But I know i might be wrong and only just hoping this is the case.\n\nMy friends and family think I should break up with him because of how upset its making me and that I feel I am being kept a secret. I am ashamed to even bring up my struggles with them anymore. So I come to you for help.\n\nMy main request is for advice on how to tell him that I am hurting and that I will break up with him if our situation doesn't change in the next month. I don't want it to be a threat or sound like a threat. I want him to understand that this is NOT because I don't love him or like him, ONLY because I feel like he is not being kind to me by excluding me from his life.\n\nI know I am being a doormat. I just want to have a good and clear conversation with him where I hear that he has understood me, so that if/when I break up I know I have tried everything. Please help me.

This fear is especially a big deal for me right now because next week I have an interview with an extremely impressive and attractive women. I creeped on her LinkedIn and she was far more impressive than me even when she had just graduated. I know you're not supposed to compare yourself to others like that but she was in clubs related to her major in school, had a few impressive projects, etc. In my school we only had 5 students in my major and no major related clubs for my major at that time, and I only have one impressive big project. How the heck can I impress her? I get nervous in interviews already, but it being a woman, and a woman I look up to is going to make it even harder for me. But I REALLY want this job, I would be doing exactly what I'm passionate about, I would have more women around than my current job (I really want close relationships with women even though they scare me), it's a hybrid role, they have great mentorship, a variety of projects, etc. I understand not being a good fit and it might not work out, but I don't want to sabotage myself because I'm afraid I'm going to say the wrong thing the entire time.\n\nPlease help women of reddit.

There isn't any green area nearby. \n\nBut like I said, I need to settle and for a few years, because I am on my own. And I am tired. I've got CPTSD and autism and I am weird like that. Noises matter, if I hear someone I get quiet. I shrink myself.\n\nThe living room is an open space and I don't feel safe in open spaces. All my life, I had maybe one rental that I liked. But it's different, because I was able to go outside. Not anymore. \n\nI also worry because I need to find a new tenant instead of me in the current place and the landlord is bitter and doesn't like me.

My last relationship was 8 years, married for 3, and while I don’t regret it, I recognize that I spent a great deal of time trying to make things “good” and satisfying so I didn’t have to deal with the fact that I made a bad investment (time, energy, emotion, etc.) We weren’t compatible and I had a gut feeling I didn’t want to get married but went through with the wedding anyway due to inertia. \n\nNow that I’ve moved on and am dating someone else, I’m at the crossroads on whether I should should be sticking or folding. It's kind of like gambling at an emotional casino .... instead of money its Emotion, Esteem, and Energy\n\n**What now?**\n\nIt can be very difficult to pull yourself out of the relationship black hole because you struggle to know who you are or what you are personally worth.\n\nSometimes we just want to have fun or don’t want to think too much about the future,  just for the experience,  and somewhere along the line it took its toll and you don’t know who you are anymore and you have become very numb. \n\nSometimes we make poor judgements about where to invest our emotional energy, but if we have an opt out moment, we can limit the damage to ourselves so that we can heal, move forward, and invest ourselves in healthier opportunities where we can reap the rewards.\n\nWhat was your opt out moment? Or Opt-in moment? was it the right choice in the long run? Can you share how those decisions impacted you as you got later into your 30s?",

Now it’s just me/us, entering into people’s ongoing lives. \n\nOf course we are in a new state, which has been amazing, but different. We went from a big city to a small rural location, so a BIG lifestyle adjustment. We both want to build healthy habits so we are even eating differently, and doing different hobbies. I don’t have any friends yet. I just started my new job this week, and I think I’m going to love it, but it’s different than what I knew for the last 5 years. One of the hardest things, which I didn’t expect, was we moved into a much bigger house. This has been making me feel farther away from my husband, which is silly because we are spending plenty of time together. The house also has had a few problems which have been overwhelming to deal with. And even more, we recently got married, so even my name is different.\n\nI think I’m just missing my comfort zone? I’m sitting here after dealing with a power outage this morning and a flooded basement tonight and wishing I was back in our small 1 bedroom second floor apartment, that I didn’t even like that much. \n\nMy husband is so happy here, and I’m so happy for him! And I’m also so happy for all the changes, I love everything that is happening. So that’s why it is kind of hard to understand or describe why im having a hard time.\n\nIs this a normal experience?

        "text": "I had a big argument with my neighbours. Perhaps, the biggest argument of my life where I was screaming, angry and said some hurtful things. So did they but to be honest, I don’t value their appraisal of me to the extent that their words would affect me. I suspect they feel similar but I’ve been unable to stop thinking about it and recoiling in shame. \n\nAltercation was about their dogs’ barking and I genuinely tried to settle it amicably. On reflection, my anger started to build up when they denied there was a problem at all. I felt very invalidated and frustrated. That set off me not being able to tolerate their dogs’ noise and coupled with an infection, I confronted them again and it became a public brawl. \n\nI have made steps to report to appropriate authorities about the noise but my brain is now telling me I blew things out of proportion and maybe I should have ignored the noise. Meanwhile, neighbours admitted to the police that they know their dogs can be “loud” bad are planning to have them trained in February; all I needed was this admission +/-an apology. \n\nMy feelings are bifurcated: \n1. I hate hate hate that I have neighbours that I won’t get along with. I hate that things will be awkward (we were never great before but exchanged smiles). I hate myself for losing my temper and not caring if I’m being filmed. I hate that I was accused of “harassment” when all I wanted to do was just sleep on my week off. Particular scenario that I ruminate on is me shutting my door twice when they came back to, in retrospect, provoke me so I could be filmed. I wish I’d carried on ignoring their knocks. I feel deeply ashamed of my actions and have toyed with the idea of apologising but i don’t know. \n\n2. I feel angry, too. Not at myself but at the people I reported to for not stepping in because the neighbours denied owning dogs at all to their landlord and estate agent. Despite this being a breach of their contract and the acknowledgment that their house is unsuitable for dogs, no one stepped in. Police told me “dogs bark, babies cry”; hopefully no one would leave their child to cry continuously for 2 hours. I feel frustrated that neighbours have said nothing will change and I just have to live with this. They’re tenants; I own my house. I regret buying that house and wish I made another decision. \n\nI am worn out (both physically and mentally) and can’t sleep.\n\nHopefully I can read about how I could have managed things better and also, how to move forward from you ladies. \n\nThank you.",

        "text": "I worked for a company full-time for 5 years in a specific role that was difficult and rare to find in the industry that I'm in. After 5 years I realized that the only way that I was going to get a raise and a promotion was if I quit and went freelance. When I submitted in my notice, my team members asked if they could hire me back as a freelancer. I loved that particular team so I said yes, and have been working with that company now as a freelancer for 2 years.\n\nSince going freelance, I've avoided large company meetings. Part of it is that I'm paid by the hour and I consider these meetings billable hours. But another reason why I avoid them is because these meetings are usually a chance for management to acknowledge people who are celebrating milestones like birthdays, anniversaries, and promotions, and in the 5 years I was with them full-time they would regularly forget me. I believe they acknowledged my birthday just one year out of the 5, and they similarly regularly forgot my work anniversaries. Until now, very few people remember that I've been with the company for as long as it's been founded. \n\nRecently I attended a meeting to support a coworker, who was presenting. Old feelings came up when management started giving out rings to people who have been with the company for 5 or more years. I didn't expect to get a ring since I'm now a freelancer, but old feelings came up and I ended up crying because of a ring that I didn't get. It felt like I was forgotten again.\n\nI feel really stupid for even wanting a damn ring because I don't even want the ring itself. I guess I just wanted some recognition for the years that I've been here. I ended up messaging one of the managers if I can get a ring-- no recognition, just the ring. I've yet to get a response, but now I feel stupid for even messaging that I wanted a ring.\n\nAm I being dumb? Are my feelings my own fault? Should I delete the message I sent that manager and disappear into my shame?",

        "text": "I’m in my mid 30s and I feel like my sex drive is off the charts. \n\nI got out of a bad marriage in my early 30s where we didn’t have a great sex life.  He had ED and we often went months without sex. In addition, he wasn’t very affectionate outside of sex and I need a lot of kissing, etc to enjoy sex. \n\nThere were also issues with attraction( honestly on both sides) as we met when I was literally a teenager and extremely thin and then over the course of years, gained some weight. \n\nI have a new spouse now and our sex life is great. 2-3x a week, maybe more if time permits.  He tells me I’m beautiful all the time and things are wonderful. \n\nBut, I have a few problems. \n\n1.  I want sex CONSTANTLY. We have sex and an hour later I want more. It’s to the point where I really feel like I need to talk to the doctor about what’s going on. But what do I say? “Hey doc, I wanna get railed all the time and it’s kinda distracting, what gives?” \n\n2. My spouse is dealing with low T which is affecting his sex drive and energy levels.  He is working on this with a doctor and I am fully supportive and understanding. This isn’t a case of mismatched libido, but truly a medical issue and one that he is addressing.  The problem is, I feel like I am thinking about sex more and initiating 99% of the time.  \n\nThis is messing with my self esteem/feeling attractive/desirable, even though I know it’s silly. I know my spouse loves me. But when he isn’t in the mood, I feel like I don’t turn him on. \n\nI want to talk about this but I want to be careful that I don’t come across as victimizing myself or blaming him or anything like that. \n\nAny thoughts? Anyone else experienced something similar?",

        "text": "TLDR; just a rant about feeling lonely and someone rubbing it in\n\nI am 31F and my grandmother is basically my family. Her opinions matter even though I disagree with majority of them but I normally can just quietly dismiss it and think about her being from another generation and raised in a different society. Worth noticing that I live in another country from her so the culture is different as well. By her standards I am a lost cause, by 31 you should have a husband and 2-3 kids.\n\nI can ‘quietly ignore’ all opinions apart from the ones about marriage and kids. She works in a place where there are lots of people her age and they constantly tell her how ‘their daughter moved to Germany and marries a businessman now’, ‘their son just moved to the UK 2 months ago, met someone and they are getting married’, ‘their niece is only 23 but already happily married and carries a third child’, ‘how much they enjoy raising grandkids’ etc. she tells them that i am married but no kids (because otherwise they would ask for pictures i guess). For the record, i have never been married nor do I think its in the cards for me. I dont have kids but she doesnt know that I’ve lost three pregnancies already and the chances of a live birth are slim. Someone at her work told her that ‘i must be sick since I am thirty and dont have kids, most likely i just cant have them’ and that they are sorry. Its intrusive and rude as hell and I was mad when she told me this but I cannot entertain that so I just shut it down. \n\nNow, today we had a conversation about me being single and it went like ‘so you decided to be alone right?’, ‘you know that we have 2 women in our family that never married and got left alone, so thats your plan?’, ‘did your ex (toxic and mentally abusive) texted you, maybe you can go back together (we ve been together for 11 years, i left)? Oh he didnt.. probably got married, why would he wait?’.. and a few more similar questions. \n\nI know she means well. I know she doesnt want me to be alone. But honestly i feel bullied and she doesnt get it. \n\nI am planning to do IUI with a donor next year (was saving for it for the past 3 years) but i started having doubts recently because  I want to share this experience (family building) with a partner, its not fair for the child to just have me (no family around or a big group of friends). I love my life alone but I want a partner, i want to share my mornings and evenings with someone, try to go through pregnancy together, raise kids, continue travelling, have sex, at least have someone to tell what I dreamt of last night - there is only so much i can do with/tell my friends!\n\nThis is why her words hurt. I want this so bad and she just rubs it in, the fact that ‘i decided to be alone’. I havent. I did therapy, antidepressants, got in a better shape, looking after my health, live alone, yet all I meet is unavailable taken people who want nothing serious. \n\nHow do i explain to her that dating now is a fucking waste of time and energy and I just dont believe in meeting anyone who can at least share 1 goal with me (building a safe and loving home for kids and ourselves, i know its a big goal)? Or how do i ignore these comments/questions from her?",

At a certain point I asked to stay the night because I wanted to spend more time with him and I also didn’t really want to drive so late. (I had already been very clear that I wanted to take things slow sexually) He said “You are more than welcome to stay but I might have a hard time respecting your boundaries.” He also kept telling me “I appreciate that you want to take things slow, but I’ve never waited this long to have sex.” And “I don’t necessarily need a strong emotional connection to have sex/enjoy sex.” \n\nI continued to stay because I felt desperate for love. Please don’t bash me in the comments. I know looking back that it wasn’t my most self respecting choice. \n\nThroughout the night he KEPT telling me how hard it was to respect my boundaries. We wound up making out and he said some conflicting statements like “I’ll respect your decision no matter what.” But continued to combine with how hard it was. \n\nI didn’t find it sexy. It didn’t make me feel comfortable or want to move forward. I felt pressured. I felt like he was ignoring my explicitly stated emotional needs. \n\nI left his house the next day feeling very crappy and anxious. And continued to feel as though his sexual desires were trumping my emotional needs. \n\nMy question - does everyone else see this behavior as disrespectful? Is there a reasonable justification for his behavior?",

As we were leaving afterward, he told one friend that “sometimes the crazy chicks can be a lot of fun.” I don’t remember the context of that statement, and I was right there on his other side so he knew I was within earshot. That kinda struck me as him not appreciating the stability we had.\n\nHis first ex was crazy according to him but he never elaborated on it or even talked about her unless I asked a question that happened to involve her in the answer (I wasn’t ever fishing for details, it just happened naturally once or twice). Personally that didn’t throw up any red flags with me because he was not constantly calling her his crazy ex or anything.\n\nHe was my first relationship so looking back now, it was a good experience but I let A LOT slide with him that I would never tolerate from my friends. Live and learn I guess lol. I just never spoke up because I didn’t want to be seen as a nag. Next time I don’t care, I WILL be a nag if it means setting and sticking with healthy boundaries for how I am treated.\n\nSo I would love to know.

        "text": "So my 40th birthday is in two weeks, and I'm dreading every day leading up to it. I have always hated birthdays to begin with, but this is one I've been feeling so much anxiety and sadness about and I'm really struggling. \n\nI was on the fence about whether or not I wanted to celebrate it, because I know I'll be a mess on that day. Throughout my 20s I had a big social circle and lots of girlfriends, and over the years my circle has gotten very small. Last year I cut out a ton of toxic friendships, which has left me with about 4 people - none of whom I'm as close to as my old friends. So about a month ago I tried sending out a group text to plan something for this, and everyone came up with excuses about doing something and no one seemed to really care. After a week of trying to rally people it felt like I was forcing them to celebrate this, and as I didn't even want to do anything in the first place, I just called it off. It made me feel even worse. \n\nI feel VERY behind in a lot of aspects, and turning 40 is just a huge indication of how little I have at this point. My circle of friends has gotten so tiny compared to where it used to be, so I don't have a lot going on outside of work - and I'm a very social person so this has been tough. Even though the women I cut out last year were bad friends in a lot of ways, I find myself missing them in times like this because at least they were always available to do something and I had way more going on socially. Second, I have always had a burning desire to get married and have children, but that seems to also be a thing that also will not be happening for me at this point as I've dealt with one failed relationship after another. I really feel outside of work (which I don't even care about that much) I have nothing.\n\nI see other girls celebrating their 40th birthdays with big trips with tons of friends, a husband, families, etc., and I'm struggling to get the 3 girlfriends I have left to go to a dinner I don't even want to do. I'm just feeling very alone, and the weight of aging and regret is really feeling heavy.",

It's a very noticeable change in fat distribution and has altered the way my clothes fit (though I have gained around 5 lbs during this period, it's not enough for this drastic of a change). I feel bloated most of the time now and some weeks I could probably pass as pregnant. I can now feel the fibroid, but at my last appointment, they confirmed it hadn't grown any larger. I haven't made any drastic changes to diet during this time and am fairly active.\n\nI'm wondering if perhaps I'm starting perimenopause or maybe my hormones have shifted. Or maybe the fibroid has grown again in the last year. Are there hormone tests that could be beneficial? Or has anyone had fibroid-related bloating and found a solution like probiotics to work for them? Has anyone gone through treatments to shrink or remove intramural fibroids and how did it go?\n\nI have an OB appointment coming up soon and want to make sure I ask the right questions, so I'm hoping for advice or thoughts from anyone who has gone through any of these symptoms.

For example if I complimented my partner publicly, my dad would cut down the compliment to make it seem less important, but with a laugh so it barely registers to me as a hurt. I was not criticized in the family, largely because of competing very hard to avoid it, I think. I am realizing this is so core to how I relate to men. I feel on some level I need to be kind of critical or competitive to connect with men, and I realize this has pushed many gentle people away. I am feeling really sad about how entrenched this is in my mind and how I relate to my (male) partner. I get so scared of rejection from him but ironically sometimes I provoke his withdrawal by being a little edgy. It hits at his own sensitivities growing up with a more overtly rejecting parent. \n\nI’m in therapy and find it helpful for working this through in the longer term. \n\nBut I’m wondering who else struggled with this… have you been able to change it? How have you learned to relate to your competitiveness in a healthier way?\n\nThanks so much y’all.",

In my 20s I was maybe more irritable before my period but nothing so black and white and definite as it is now. Curious if other women have noticed this shift in themselves after reaching 30.",

        "text": "I engage in a group activity where I see the same adults week after week. I got pretty close to one of the group members, and she came to my house for a party and I went to her house once to watch a sporting event just the two of us.\n\nShe has a desire to be my friend but then constantly pulls back. She invited me to watch a sporting event at a bar with her and her husband and then the next day, told me she didn't want to go because she didn't want to eat fried food and drink beer. She invited me to come over to play board games during Christmas week and then told me she couldn't, because she had another activity planned and couldn't handle two things in the same week. Similarly, she said she wanted to have my husband and me over to plan board games in February and then in the next text, she told me she's too busy during February. \n\nI invited people from the group activity to my house to watch a sporting event, and she told me that she didn't really want to come, because she would rather sit at home and watch it by herself. And then, she told me that she would come \"out of obligation,\" asked what she could bring, and I picked pigs in a blanket off a list of things she said that she usually brings places. And then yesterday, she sends me this long rambling text about how it's going to be too hard for her to bring pigs in a blanket and she doesn't know what to bring, and I got a little short and told her that I didn't care what she brought. I know if I picked something, she would just come up with some B.S. reason why she couldn't do it.\n\nI don't want to start drama in the group activity but at the same time, I don't want to engage with this behavior because it's hurtful and it's just too much to deal with. Everyone else that I invited, they said they either wanted to come or didn't, asked what they could bring, and that was it.",

        "text": "I (33F) think I am just needing a little reassurance here, that I'm not being totally spiteful in this situation. I've been dealing with a lot, so I realise I may be responding more emotionally than I would without recovering from an assault and my dog being in the end of life stage. My dog is my absolute world and the last year has been incredibly difficult, lots of ups and downs and now we're coasting into \"that time\".\n\nMy friend (32F) has constant marital drama, to the point where she called me up last weekend (on a Sunday late at night) to take her to her mum's because she felt unsafe. She asked me to help her get some help from authorities, housing etc, which I have but as usual she and her husband have made up and it's just \"good vibes\" from now. Except, this is happening more often than not and I'm tired.\n\nThe dumping of info on me has gotten to a point where I know in a social situation it'd feel difficult to be pleasant to her husband now - although not in my nature to shout/cause a scene. He has alluded to me being disruptive to \"norms\" since I left an abusive relationship 5yrs ago and turned my life around for the better, that I will end up alone (despite being a really lovely relationship for nearly 2yrs now). It's worn me down over the last few years as I think I'm the only one privy to the gruesome details. She won't tell her other friends because of the family image she portays being important to her and for her child's sake. Aside from that I do enjoy my friend's company, just sick of being a therapist.\n\nI am awful with wording things in the moment, but feel like I need to let my friend know that enough is enough and create some boundaries around that, without coming off like I don't care about her and her kid, because I really do. I wouldn't want her to end up in a dangerous situation and think I wasnt there for her. It's hard to keep seeing her so distraught. \n\nI  would appreciate some advice if anyone has any.",

        "text": "Remember that feeling we’d get as kids, when we’d grab a favorite toy or book, one that we loved until yesterday but today it just feels childish? It’s that feeling when you know you’ve turned a new chapter, or are growing up basically. Up to the age of 18-20 even, these feelings occurred so frequently, and then the frequency started slowing down. Now when the feeling comes up It’s bittersweet because it’s not a marker of growing up, but one of growing old. I don’t mind growing old, it’s a privilege tbh but I think I mourn the closing of a chapter.\n\nThe most recent time this happened to me was yesterday when a friend of mine whose much younger texted me asking if I wanted to go to a concert. The last concert I’d been to was a few months back and while I loved that artist I hadn’t enjoyed the concert experience. I realized I was done with concerts (open to a large open air festival, or a small bar with live music henceforth) and texted my friend saying no. Then I mourned the younger me who’d have loved to go, but I guess she’s no more.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to know if this is a common feeling, and if yes what was your moment that made you mourn the loss of a younger version of you.",

        "text": "\\*Very long post incoming!\\*\n\nI'm pretty introverted and I like my space. My home is my sanctuary and while I enjoy hosting friends and family for nice dinners, I don't really enjoy overnight houseguests.\n\nI should be honest and say that I have been diagnosed with anxiety and see a therapist twice a month. I can get very stuck in my ways and find it difficult to say yes to new experiences.\n\nMy husband is much more social than me and enjoys being around people. \n\nHe became Twitter friends a few years ago with a woman who lives in the US (we are in the UK) and she now comes to visit us multiple times a year.\n\nWe don't have a spare room at the moment so she sleeps on the sofa in the living room, something I find difficult as I can't really enjoy our newly-renovated living room while she's here (a first-world problem, I'm aware!)\n\nShe is a perfectly lovely person and I do like her. The problem is that she comes to visit so often, and her visits are very long. The last visit was 5 weeks long and the visit before that was 6 weeks long.\n\nShe typically comes two or three times a year.\n\nMy husband loves her visiting and always wishes she could stay longer and I know she feels the same. But I cannot stand it!\n\nI'm fine for the first few days or even a week or two, but after that I just find myself wishing she would go home. I want my space back and I want to spend quality time with my husband without someone else there.\n\nI've tried to speak to him about it, and he says it really isn't that much time out of the year. He says that it's really important to him that he sees his friend and that she needs to stay for a long time as she lives so far away.\n\nAnother issue is that she doesn't do anything by herself - we take her everywhere and plan the majority of her visits. It's becoming very expensive for me to do this multiple times a year and also draining - it's hard to always think of new things to do!\n\nShe does pay her own way so that's not an issue, it's just that all the outings and activities start to stack up.\n\nI should point out that they are not having an affair (long backstory but just trust me) and I have made it clear that the length and frequency of the visits is upsetting me. He said her visits could be shortened but I can tell it upsets him.\n\nI can't tell if I'm being unreasonable or whether most people would find this situation intolerable. I don't want to be the wife that stops him from seeing his friend as often as he wants, but my mental health is suffering. I'm also concerned that this is my anxiety talking and that the situation is absolutely fine and normal.\n\nI'm becoming concerned that this will be my life from now on unless I leave my husband which I don't want to do.\n\nShould I accept that choosing to be with my husband means that I need to deal with a frequent and long-term houseguest, or is there a way that we can compromise so that we're both happy?",
