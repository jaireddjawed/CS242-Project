It’s clear that my vocabulary is lacking, and I still need to learn a couple hundred more kanji.\n\nI was doing some practice questions for JLPT and for the following sections here is how I feel I do:\n\nListening: N3 is too easy, N2 is slightly too hard\n\nGrammar: N3 is too easy, N2 is too hard\n\nVocab/Kanji: N2 is too easy, N1 is slightly too hard\n\nThese are for getting 100 percent on a given section, and I’m aware you need less than 50 percent to pass at N1 so maybe I would pass the exam on the vocab front, but on the other sections I am only N2 at best. I’ve completed both Genki books and both Quartet books and am wondering where to go from here with passing the N1 in mind(I’m aware to become more proficient in general immersing is probably the best). My immediate goal is to pass the N1 as soon as possible as it will give me the confidence to start immersing in things that I would normally be too unskilled to understand. Also it would be nice to have the certificate as it opens up a lot of possibilities in Japan.\n\nThank you in advance for advice!",

I mean you all know that, right? This was entirely voluntary and you *paid* for the pleasure.\n\nAnyways, I sat N4 today and hopefully it went well. And I got to thinking about what's next. N3 is jammed into that cavernous gap that used to exist between the old L3 and L2, trying to make it a little less daunting to make that jump up. That being said despite existing for a decade there doesn't seem to be a massive amount of choices for studying, and I was hoping some of our more elite learners could give some pointers.\n\nSo far I've seen an Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese, Tobira, and Quartet recommended relatively often, with Quartet being the newest of those and actually released after N3 became a thing.\n\nMy questions - is Quartet good as an ebook, or is it better physical? I've seen that it might not be enough by itself for N3, so should I use the Shinkanzen Master to fill in the gaps (and would a combination of these be enough for N3)? Or do you have other recommendations instead - what worked for you?",

But if my goal is reaching fluency, then this isn’t it. Like I go through the textbook with my teacher on iTalki, then we do a couple of exercises, but a week later I can’t remember those grammar points. \n\nI tried watching more anime, and hearing some of the grammar did help, but I feel like I need a way to retain it that isn’t just hoping to hear it on my favorite shows. \n\nI’m thinking of maybe (after taking a rest since I’m seriously exhausted from today’s test haha) trying to write my own sentences with each grammar point, then asking her to check. But if you guys have better tips I’d really appreciate it! \n\nFor now, I’m looking forward to taking a break and focusing on conversation practice with my teacher. \n\nI also need to vent just a bit: I’m kind of a perfectionist and I’m used to going into tests super prepared. This time, I didn’t get to review as much as I needed to because work seriously piled up over the past few months. From now on, I’m only taking the JLPT in July because at least then I won’t have to balance the influx of holiday-related work AND reviewing for the test.",

        "text": "First off I hope that this post belongs here. It didn't seem to fit in the pinned daily question thread, but I may be wrong.\n\nSo I'm at a point in my Japanese language studies where I feel like I should potentially be branching out, but I seem to hit an immediate wall everywhere I turn. This isn't a \"discouraged\" post at all, but rather a question on how best to proceed and advice from anyone more learned than I.\n\nI don't feel like an *absolute* beginner anymore, but I'm still very much a beginner. I'm cruising on my vocab and general low-level grammar studies with a combination of Genki and Wanikani. The same as I have been doing for about 6 months. I'm almost lesson 11 on Wanikani and going to finish Genki 1 in about 2 weeks. About 1100 vocabulary words or so. Again, I understand that this isn't anything above beginner level, however I feel like I should start branching into reading or speaking in order to better solidify the vocabulary and grammar that I'm learning, as I have somewhat of a tenuous grasp on a lot of the concepts I learn.\n\nMy issue is this: in reading graded readers for practice for instance, I find that level 0 is not much more than a vocabulary test, as I often don't recognize words, but they are not difficult grammar wise. Once I try reading material that seems to test me on grammar, I can't understand *most* of the words being said, so it's not too helpful as I can't understand enough of the context.\n\nFor anyone that has experienced this same issue, is it best to keep grinding vocabulary to build that base before moving onto reading? Is reading something that really should be jumped into head-first? I would like to avoid having a glaring weakness in my language studies if a year or so down the road, I realize I haven't been developing in the way I should have been. I'm content with working the same as I have been, but I have a nagging feeling that I'm neglecting some areas that I'm not sure about. I understand that YMMV, but I feel like I've been making good progress and would hate to see it start to dwindle, or have such a weak spot that what I'm learning isn't really applicable.\n\nAny help/advice would be much appreciated!",

        "text": "Today I asked a native speaker about a sentence containing the causative form of する and was surprised to learn about a different nuance than what I studied. The word appeared in this technical sentence: 通知部は、基地局に対し、パラメータをドローンに送信させるための指示情報を通知する**。**\n\nI always thought that a noun with the particle に　appearing in front of a causative verb is the noun being forced/made to perform the action of the verb. For example, 「お母さんはお父さんに虫を食べさせる」(Mum makes dad eat a bug) . Therefore, I read the sentence like this: “The notifier notifies the base station of instruction information that *makes the drone transmit the parameter*.”\n\nHowever, the native speaker said that in this case, 送信させる doesn’t mean “make/force to send” but simply “send” in a regular, transitive sense. That is, he translated it as: “The notifier notifies the base station of instruction information *about sending the parameter to the drone*.”\n\nI can see how this makes more sense in the given context, but it made me wonder why the causative is used at all if it doesn’t have the typical causative use.",

        "text": "Hello there!\n\nI have something from my JLPT 5 materials that I don’t understand. \nI have 2 templates for some grammar rules and I can’t comprehend the difference. These are the templates: \n\nP に N が あります / います \n\nNは P に あります/います\n\nI see that they are different in structure but for the translation, I get the same thing from the examples in my book, which makes me confused. \nHere are my examples of how I understood the previous templates:\n\nつくえのとなりにいすがあります\n\nいすはつくえのとなりにあります\n\nFrom what I got, they would both mean: ‘’There is a chair next to the desk’’.\n\nCan someone please help and explain it or tell me as exact of a translation as possible for my example or any other example used for both templates so I can understand exactly the difference between the 2 and when to use which. \n\nThank you!",
