I have an Avenger Hurricane my wife bought me in 2018 and it has been a favorite but I always overlooked the traditional stainless Avenger as something that looked like an outdated model.  I have seen someone wear one and now find them attractive with a leather band.  Which would you get if you could pick either one. Best I can tell on the grey market the Navitimer is about $1,600 more expensive.",

I also wanted Omega seamaster 300 but 42mm is a bit too big for my 15.5cm wrists, and I was afraid I’d regret like 10 years later. The money I will be spending is part of my late father has left me, and I have decided to buy a good watch from and pass it on to my kid, so I don’t want to buy something I might potentially regret..\n\nI know it really is a matter of taste but I went to AD and checked both of them, and they feel equally great to me, maybe I am leaning a bit towards railmaster because of the dial.\n\nPlease give any thoughts if someone owns one or both.\n\nI will be replacing with NATO or leather straps time to time when I end up buying either of them.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I looked at vintage Smiths, but the ones with the cool pointed second hand seem to be over my budget. Thanks for any tips.",

I found an Omega DeVille through an online vendor here in the Netherlands and she really liked the look of it. However, I am completely new to vintage watches and have little idea what to pay attention to. Of course I want to avoid the cat in the proverbial bag and was wondering if you have input on this listing:\n\nhttps://www.chrono24.nl/omega/omega-de-ville-ladies-watch--id27591338.htm\n\nI am setting some budget apart for servicing and I am able to meet with the seller and see the watch in person before buying. Some questions I have: Would you ever consider buying vintage pieces through these channels from vendors like this? How much would servicing typically cost on watches such as this? Any things to look out for when I see this piece in person? Any help or input would be much appreciated!",
