Here’s a few examples of songs I like, could anyone let me know what genre/genres these count as? \n\n“I’m glad there is you.” Julie London \n“Land of 1000 dances” The Walker Brothers\n“Born too late” The Poni-Tails\n“Stars of the midnight range” Johnny Bond\n“You’re my world” Cilla Black \n\nAlso, if anyone has any music suggestions for bands of this genre/genres that are German, please let me know :)",

You know how when you listen to a song for the first time, if you like it, something will click. You could like the delivery of the vocals, the lyrics, or the production. With the genres I like, something about a song will click for me, and its usually 1 of those 3 things or multiple. With slow songs nothing at all clicks. It's like my brain just doesn't get any enjoyment from it lol. Slow songs are good background music for me, but could I sit down and actively listen to it? No. I wanna know, do you guys ONLY enjoy slower or faster paced music? Or do you enjoy both?",

The song is moving, so I recommend you take some time to listen to it when you need to clear your mind and relax.\nI am normally releasing it on International Workers’ Day, but I wanted to give you early access for some time. You can listen to it [here](https://youtu.be/wNbeCrTfUBk).",
