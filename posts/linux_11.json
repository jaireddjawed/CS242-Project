        "title": "Using INCRON to Monitor Files",
        "author": "SaxonyFarmer",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/117h5v6/using_incron_to_monitor_files/",
        "text": "I have recently installed INCRON to trigger a script when a file is saved in Dropbox from outside my PC.  Here are my experiences and some tips:\n\nInstallation was quick and easy.  Do a search to find specifics for installation on your distribution.  \n\nI modified a control file to permit my id and root to create tables (akin to crontab).  I added my id and 'root' to '/etc/incron.allow' using 'nano' (use your favorite editor).  \n\nI created a table to control which files and folders INCRON will monitor.  This is much like 'cron' with a command (incrontab -e) to create and modify the table.  See the online guides for specifics on changing the editor it uses and the specific format of the table and triggers.  Here's a simple example of my table to monitor a file in my preferred cloud provider, Dropbox:\n\n/&lt;my home&gt;/Dropbox/apps/WahooFitness/   IN\\_MOVED\\_TO     /&lt;my home&gt;/Scripts/FITProc1.sh\n\nThis line tells INCRON to monitor a specific folder in my Dropbox folder and when a new file is moved into it, start the script '[FITProc1.sh](https://FITProc1.sh)' (a BASH script that runs a Python program among other tasks).  \n\nTIP:  I found the info in [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/incron-command-in-linux-with-examples/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/incron-command-in-linux-with-examples/)\n\nto be very helpful!!!   I found this when I could not get a simple test script to execute when something was added to the monitored folder.  I created this test script to make sure what I wanted to do would happen and this test script wasn't triggering.  I eventually setup monitoring for all events and then saw which events were being triggered when I copied a file to the folder and then when the external device (a bike computer) did the same.  When the file was moved from Dropbox to the folder on my PC via the Dropbox daemon, a expected 'write' event was not happening.  This is how I found Dropbox was moving the file so I triggered on this event (IN\\_MOVED\\_TO).\n\nTIP: INCRON would tell me my test script was being started (seen by 'sudo systemctrl status incron' and in log messages) but I wasn't seeing any expected results (a message file in '/tmp' and emails).  Research found the site I mentioned above and their experience said that INCRON was not able to write to the system-wide '/tmp'.  I changed my script and Python program to use /&lt;my home&gt;/tmp and I saw the expected results when a file was added to the folder.\n\nSo far, I am happy with the results using INCRON.  When I finish a bike ride, my bike computer uploads a file to Dropbox via the iPhone app and within a minute or so, I have the results from the Python program started in the script sent as text messages and in my email inbox.  I can also see this when I issue the 'status' command shown previously.",

But before I start deep diving and possibly reading any outdate information or watching things that may confuse me. I figured I would ask here. Now I did do a search in here to try and find some new post that may be asking the same stuff but a lot of it may be outdate. \n\nSo far I’ve watched a small series from User NetworkChuck on YouTube and it’s been helpful for the most part. I’ve been able to grasp most the information along with following along while using Hack the Box’s online simulator. That being said, I am looking for more information to get me on the right track. \n\nAre there any recommended books that people would recommend (Linux Bible, etc.)?\nAny other YouTuber’s who discuss Linux that’d you recommend?\nAre there any Linux Distributions or online simulators that would be recommended for someone new looking to practice and follow along?\n\nI’ll be honest I’m more of a hands of person, so that has me a bit worried about buying a book because tend to be a little difficult in holding my attention. But I am really wanting to commit some time into this and see if this is indeed a career path I would like to pursue. \n\n\nIf you read this all and have any advice for me, thank you for your time.

It works like a charm for me. I spent today writing verbose Readme file for it, So if you have interest in some vault like setup , which can be scripted easily to open what you want, or just easy peasy vault which opens and ask you what you want to do, do try it out.   \n\n\nFeatures \n\n1.  Creating Vaults with Password or Keyfile\n2.  Adding Multiple Passwords or Keyfile\n3.  Deleting Multiple Passwords or Keyfile\n4.  AutoClosing all mount points on exit \n5. Toggling on and off  a AutoOpen Keyfile ( basically when keyfile is present at said location, you won't be prompted to enter password or choose keyfile , it will auto-open)  \n\n\nThanks for your interest, Script lacks comments, but i have chosen good variable names (helps me too)",

        "text": "Hello, Fedora user here. I have run Linux exclusively on my desktop and laptop for 3 years. However, I still on the verge of \"Is desktop Linux mature enough?\" \n\nThe good: I can legitimately do anything I want. I love that my whole Gnome DE has a color scheme which I love. I can configure my laptop to run nearly fansless with decent performance and most importantly I found the gnome workflow is miles, miles ahead of any other DEs or operating system. As a privacy junky, I choose Linux too. All in all, Linux introduced a lot of new and cool things to me, things that once I know it, I could never go back\n\nThe bad: since those corporate capitalists, Linux has some issues that bother me alot, though I have not run into serious issues like glitches, system bork. In my mind, I always has the worry of \"are all of my hardware working as intended, are the drivers all there, are they even good?\" As we all know, AMD power management still sucks (6.3 please save me!). Scaling sucks, Wayland sucks for some people. Even hardware acceleration on the browsers is not working with most distros and on chromium.....I rather die. Software has \"cope\" Linux support, like the ass Brave browser has weird UI as supposed to what it should look like when you font is larger than 9 which all distros have 11px font. Not to mention the slow, insignificant development of DE compared to the kernel. So even though, the Linux kernel part is great, it it still quite bad on the desktop. Some people say their system work perfectly, others claim you are better of with windows because there are something that will never have driver in the kernel. The fear of a great app just randomly being unmaintained and left completely too. Honestly, one can go on and on about the issues or stuffs that lack in Linux.\n\nThe take: I am just in this wierd dilemma of choosing an OS. One is spyware but it works, one is miles better at things that it is good at but ages behind most others. I mean what do I choose? live without those \"new things\" I have just discovered and or breakdown and eventually return to Windows because of the time wasted on making a simple thing works? \n\nThe other question: can I please, in my life, enjoy the life when Gnu/Linux have it all. 2050 Maybe? \n\nAnd I'm talking about relatively new hardware, like from 2019 or newer. So let settle this, Gnu/Linux on desktop and laptop. Yay or nay?",

        "text": "# Linux is not Windows\n\nMy goal with this post is create some clarification on what Linux is and why most software that people demand doesn't run on Linux. Yes, it is rant, because I'm tired of seeing this debate continue on.\n\nLet's create some context first.\n\n## What is an Operating System (OS)?\n\nAn Operating System (OS) is a type of software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer. It provides the basic foundation for running applications and managing computer resources, such as memory and storage. The operating system also provides the user interface, which allows users to interact with the computer. Examples of popular operating systems include Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\n## What is a Kernel?\n\nA kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is responsible for managing the resources of the computer, managing hardware, managing the execution of user programs, and providing an interface for user programs to interact with the hardware. The kernel is responsible for providing basic services for all other parts of the operating system.\n\n## How does a Kernel differ from an OS?\n\nIn comparison to an operating system, the kernel is a more low-level component. While an operating system is responsible for managing the resources of the computer and providing an interface for user programs, the kernel is responsible for managing the execution of user programs and providing an interface for user programs to interact with the hardware. Additionally, the kernel is responsible for managing hardware and providing device drivers for hardware components.\n\n## What is a Linux Distribution?\n\nA Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and [1], often, other components such as the GNU tools, additional software, a package manager, and other components. It is typically distributed in the form of a Linux-based operating system, although some distributions are also available as live CDs or as certain types of pre-installed systems. Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS.\n\n## How did Windows come about and gain the majority market share?\n\nBill Gates bought QDoS from Tim Patterson for a measly fee. Gates already had a contract set up with IBM, but couldn't meet the contract deadline. Patterson was offering his OS for sale and Gates jumped on it. Patterson later sued gates for misleading him and leaving out the fact that he had a contractual obligation/deal with IBM. IBM manufactured most PCs back then and once DoS was presented to them, it was end game.",

        "text": "Hey Linux community!  \nI'm working on a book about NixOS and I am in extreme need for your feedback. I'm posting this here instead of the NixOS subreddit because I want to hear from outsiders. I think the NixOS community is missing the mark with stuff that's too hardcore for the average person. Think of it as an \"outside-of-nix\" survey. There's already a \"NixOS survey\" with little purpose for our case, since I would want to target people outside of NixOS - those make the majority and are the ones who would ensure the healthy growth of nix ecosystem given the opportunity to get better with nix.  \nI want to emphasize that this book is about NixOS, not just nix. There's a lot of confusion around the name \"nix\" and I believe we need to make it clear that NixOS is a complete operating system. My goal is to help people get started with NixOS without needing PhD or reading hardcore research papers. I want to show them how to build a workstation that Just Works (TM) and give them a solid foundation to grow from. It just bugs me how much the developers focus on theory. I want to showcase learning by doing, and make it relevant for everyone.  \nThe book currently finds itself in the form of numerous drafts (counting in the low hundreds), and I plan on sharing them on my blog as (not so) short tutorials. Check out the latest one here: https://drakerossman.com/blog/how-to-convert-default-nixos-to-nixos-with-flakes. Once they're refined, they'll become the chapters of the book.  \nI'm hoping to publish the book in the next 3 months, but I need your help to make it happen. Your feedback is extremely important to me and it will help me identify and cover the missing parts. I've submitted an article to track the progress of how the book's going: https://drakerossman.com/blog/practical-nixos-the-book. I've also got a newsletter on my website, so you may want to subscribe for updates.   \nMany thanks!",

I've been using ZFS for years now.\n\nI just find it weird I can [view unique snapshot file versions](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm), and restore them immediately if I want to, or [view them as a `diff`s against the live file](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/blob/master/scripts/bowie.bash), while others go digging through backups, or don't because that's a pain.  That others make preventative copies, and I just say \"YOLO\". Why?  Because snapshots are cheap.  Why not [take automatic, non-periodic snapshots](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/blob/master/scripts/ounce.bash), before you edit any file on my system?  I don't have to wait hours to calculate `rsync` deltas, I just [send](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/8/zfs-send.8.html) the 4KB that changed.\n\nI can't get over this attitude of \"I don't need all that/ZFS\", combined with \"Why are backups so hard? And why do they take so long?\", \"I really could use a version of this file I had 3 days ago\", \"I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping my `tar` solution doesn't break.\"  \n\nAre you guys stuck for some reason?

New in `httm` version [0.22.0](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/releases/tag/0.22.0):\n\nNILFS2 is a very interesting log-structured filesystem which appears to take continuous snapshots.  That is -- you can simply stop the filesystem's GC and rollback, or mount the filesystem at any transaction point.  \n\nThis feature was so interesting to me, it served as inspiration for [ounce](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/blob/master/scripts/ounce.bash), a wrapper script for httm which give you no mental overhead, non-periodic dynamic snapshots.\n\nBut NILFS2 also offers traditional snapshots and `httm` now offers NILFS2 support. I've had a lot of fun playing with NILFS2 and the only thing missing for me is a snapshot automounter.  OG NILFS had one (?) and NILFS2 should have one too!  \n\nPlease, please, please, get on that Linux people/NILFS2 enthusiasts!
