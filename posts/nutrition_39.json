And I just got done listening to it today.\n\nIf any of you have Libby or even audible, I HIGHLY recommend this. It literally gives a broad and in depth overview of the history of food from the beginning of humanity to now.\n\nIf any of you have been struggling with changing your diet or trying to eat healthier but can't figure out how, this book explains so much. It answers so many questions you probably didn't even know you had about how our food system became what it is today. And if it seems broken and screwed up, that's because it is. And this is book explains how it happaned.\n\nMy main take away from it is don't feel guilty. We were all literally born into a system that has problems. All we can do is our best when it comes to trying to eat right.",

No \"will make you hard for hours\" no \"I can remember so much better now\". With sku's named \"Brain\" and \"Heart\" and \"Eyes\", these branded supplements will only contain ingredients that have been researched and tested by ESTABLISHED institutions (think Mayo Clinic or Rockefeller University.) Now, when you or I go to Walgreens to get our supplements, out of the hundreds of vitamins on the shelves with the multitude of fancy names and pseudo benefits and wild packaging (and, lets face it, never in aphabetical order), we can just look for the black and white labeling with the simple name of the bodypart that needs support like the ones mentioned above or \"Hair\" or \"Skin\" (lots of possibilities.) \n\nI have a business plan for this. I am looking to do one of two things: 1) Sell the domain name (so that you, the owner, can take this idea and run with it on your own with no websites to redo or corporate name or type changes to be made.) 2) Consult on the build out.  The Industry needs a company like this.",

        "text": "Hey everyone! Today is World Soil Day and I wanted to take a moment to talk about the importance of soil and how it affects our daily lives.\n\nMany people might think of soil as just dirt, but it's actually a complex ecosystem that supports plant growth and is home to countless microorganisms. In fact, one teaspoon of soil can contain more microorganisms than there are people on Earth!\n\nBut soil is not just important for plants and microorganisms. It's also crucial for our food production. Without healthy soil, we wouldn't be able to grow nutritious fruits and vegetables or raise healthy livestock. In other words, our food supply would be greatly diminished without healthy soil.\n\nAside from its role in food production, soil also plays a key role in our environment. It helps to filter and clean our water, reduce air pollution, and regulate climate. Soil also acts as a natural carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide and helping to combat climate change.\n\nSo as we celebrate World Soil Day, let's remember the many ways that soil supports our daily lives. And let's take action to protect and preserve our soil for future generations.\n\nHappy World Soil Day!",
