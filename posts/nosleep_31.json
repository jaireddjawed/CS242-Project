        "text": "I Took The Benedryl Challenge, I Met The Hat Man\r\n\r\n…And I dunno if he’s a friend or a foe. \r\n\r\nMy name is [----Redacted----], but you can call me D, and I had a spinal laminectomy surgery back in 2019. The surgery was a success, but there was already a severe amount of damage done to my spinal cord. Enough damage that the stenosis left me paraplegic – I can’t walk or put any pressure through my legs. I have very little movement or sensation in my lower body, so every minute of every day is spent in a wheelchair or in a hospital bed. I took my mobility for granted, often joking that my main goal in life was to never work again. I’ve achieved my goal, but I’d give anything to take it back. It’s the single biggest regret, not taking better care of myself, living a mostly sedentary life. I completely blame myself for my condition, and I feel like a burden no matter what everyone tells me. Because I don’t have any family who’s able to care for me, I’m somewhat forced to stay in a nursing home until a better arrangement can be made. The food here is strictly for nutritional purposes. It's definitely not gourmet, the taste is super bland, and everything comes out of a bag or from a can. I mean, most of the time it’s edible, but it's often unidentifiable on the worst days. Luckily, on the rare occasions that I have some spendable income, we are allowed to order take-out, which is nice. \r\n\r\nI have a room to myself, which I’m very grateful for. Some of the more elderly folks here have to share a room – their memories are failing, so they hardly even realize they have a roommate. I’ve made friends with some of the staff, and I’m one of the longest tenured residents here. I’ve been here longer than the majority of the staff. There’s a horribly high turn-over rate. The level of care here leaves something to be desired, but every time DHEC visits, they’ve done just enough to pass inspection, its frustrating for sure. Being understaffed and underappreciated causes a lot of call-outs, leading to confusion when it comes to scheduling. The employees who do show up are often responsible for more residents than they’re legally supposed to have. Every day, I take an ungodly amount of medications, with my med-pass starting at 9 am and going on periodically until 9-10pm. There’s too many medicines to name here, but to sum it up, I take a pill to help me sleep, one for depression/anxiety, a blood thinner, and an ‘as needed’ narcotic pain tablet, among many, many other, less significant meds. \r\n\r\nAs time goes by, I play video games on the big screen TV that my best buddy (and only real friend) set up for me, watch my streaming services and horror movies on my laptop, or watch sports on the facility provided 24 inch TV that’s mounted on the wall. It’s not too bad, but I get insanely bored a lot of the time. I constantly feel isolated and lonely. I have a healthy fear of becoming institutionalized due to being monitored around the clock. I feel like it could be happening without me really realizing it. I’m in my late 30s, but I feel like a mix between being a baby or an elderly invalid. However, I do occasionally get ‘care packages’ from friends and family who aren’t close enough to visit. They send me snacks, cash-app money, Doordash, or Ubereats meals. The best is when they send me gummie edibles or disposable THC pens. Ya see, I suffer from chronic insomnia, and the weed really helps me to relax and hopefully fall asleep. So, sorry for the incredibly long introduction, but I think it’s important to get a feel for what my day-to-day life is like. As if that first part wasn’t scary enough, here's why I’m writing all this today. \r\n\r\nBeing like any other bored elder-millennial, I get into the trends only kinda, way later than everyone else. I was watching YouTube videos, TikToks, and scouring Reddit when I wandered across a video and a subsequent post about the Benedryl challenge. In absolutely no way am I recommending that anyone attempt this, had I thought it through a little more, I wouldn’t have even considered trying. Essentially, this challenge is to take enough anti-histamine pills until you black out and start feeling a sort of high. But for me, it was supposed to be like a way to hallucinate, or kinda trip, y’know. It's just a lot cheaper and easier than LSD, or ‘shrooms. I kept researching and saw some rather terrifying reports of people hearing voices, seeing shadow people, or becoming overwhelmingly paranoid. Then the absolute worst claim of all was sightings of an enormously tall, shadowy figure wearing what could only be described as a hat and long coat, with red, or yellow piercing eyes. No other discernable features or characteristics, just an all black, wispy, floating shadow. These sightings were almost always accompanied by a tremendous feeling of deep dread. Some people claimed that the Hat Man approached them and told them things. Ranging from clairvoyant and helpful to inspirational, all the way to the other extremes of threatening, hateful, and haunting. Maybe even reminding you of a terrible event from your life.\r\n\r\nThere were mixed reports of seeing the Hat Man even after the trip was over, and they were lucid again. People claimed to have recurring dreams of new encounters with the Hat Man. Ya know how sometimes we watch disturbing things out of sheer curiosity, like wanting to look away, but rubbernecking at the car wreck as you drive by – if that makes sense. That’s how I felt about seeing the Hat Man. It seemed really fascinating but totally horrifying at the same time. So, I started planning a way to get my hands as many pills as I could. Again, I absolutely do not suggest doing this, I want to be very clear. So, I can ask for and receive over-the-counter medicines pretty much whenever I need them. Ya see,  every day, or every other day I’d ask for a Benedryl, and because I have very sensitive skin, I get it with no questions asked. I’d pretend to take the pill and slip it into a baggie I kept in a book bag next to my bed. After I saved up around 12 pills, I felt like that was enough for a try. I had seen where some people were taking like 20-30, sometimes even more at one time. I was not dedicated enough to try that many at once. I just figured if they didn’t work, I’d just save up more and try again. So the plan was, on that coming Friday night, I’d have the on duty nurse put a Benedryl into my night meds to make a grand total of 13 at one time. I’d take my regularly scheduled medications and then pop the extra Benedryl once the nurse closed my door. \r\n\r\nI passed that day by flirting with a hot CNA who works here. She is big time into ghosts, demons, and other paranormal stuff. She likes to tease me by telling me how an old lady passed away in my room and how, during the night shift, they see and hear unexplainable things in the hallways. I was becoming increasingly nervous waiting for my night time med-pass. I took a THC gummie and a few puffs from my weed pen to try to calm myself. The nurse finally came and dropped off my meds. It was go time. I took everything at once with an entire cup of water. I tilted the bed into a more comfortable position and continued watching old reruns of the ‘X-Files’ until the medications took effect. It wouldn’t be too long, maybe 20 or 30 minutes before I started to feel everything kicking in at once. As the tidal wave of chemicals hit my brain, I felt the darkness start to envelope me, slowly pulling me under. I could still hear the sounds from the TV buried in the background, but my ears were flooded with the roaring noise of my blood rushing through my body and my steadily calm heartbeat. I felt like I was awake, but I knew that couldn’t be true, I was STANDING in a world of blackness. It was difficult to wrap my head around what was going on. I was free to walk around and explore this vast unknown darkness that was all around me. \r\n\r\nI walked around exploring a bit, I saw some shadowy figures huddled together whispering to each other. They paid me no mind as I walked by. I could hear disembodied screams and footsteps all around me. I swear I could hear the voice of the hot CNA I mentioned earlier. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him stalking me, the Hat Man. He was darker than everything else. Like I was looking into pure darkness, then seeing this entity, his silhouette was a darker shade, if that makes any sense. The Hat Man was darker than anything else in this place. Here’s the other strange thing, I didn’t have to ask if he was the Hat Man. It was like, I just knew, y’know? He approached me slowly, and I could feel his eyes boring holes right through me. I don’t think I’ve ever been more terrified than I was right then, but I felt frozen, completely unable to move or run away. He then ‘spoke’ to me, but it wasn’t like audible words, it was more like his voice being echoed into my head, like how you think to yourself, only these weren’t my thoughts, and definitely not in my voice. The Hat Man’s voice ranged from deep and soothing like James Earl Jones to a gravelly and demonic rumble. He would first speak to me using the soothing voice. \r\n\r\n“I know why you’re here” \n\r\n“That’s good, because I don’t” – I thought back. \n\r\n“Its true what the hot CNA told you. People have died here.They do stare at you while you sleep. But not you, no, you won’t die here, you have other things to do.”\n\r\n“Uh…\" well, uh, what’s that supposed to mean?” I asked, starting to feel threatened.\n\r\n“I think you know what I mean. One day you’ll get to leave here.” \n\r\nHappily surprised, I asked, “Really, how long until I get to leave?”\n\r\n“It doesn’t work that way, I tell you, what I want you to know.”\n\r\nGetting slightly annoyed, I said, “That’s some bullshit.” This is when I got the first taste of the haunting demonic voice.\n\r\n“No need for expletives, you’re invading my home, remember?”\n\r\nAn embarrassed, “Sorry,” was all I thought out.\n\r\nHis voice had returned to the soothing one, only it felt like a put on to try to calm me down.\n\r\n“I can’t tell you everything up front. That’ll ruin the fun.” \n\r\n“OK, so now what?” Was my reply. \r\n\r\nHe changed the subject abruptly and began telling me about upcoming events – rather natural, or man caused - horrifying occurrences, unspeakable things, that were to take place over the next few months, years even I’m choosing not to go into details here, I do believe in speaking things into existence, and I don’t want any of that being held on my conscience. Just know, it's some awful shit, but basically, like things that already happen every day, so it’d be difficult to pinpoint the accuracy of the predictions. His reddish eyes then sharply narrowed, and I felt like if he had a mouth, he’d be smiling. But it felt really evil, I dunno how to describe it, but it wasn’t natural, I mean shit, none of this was natural, but you get what I’m saying, right? His last message is the one that really frightened me more than anything else.\n\r\n“Since you decided to visit my world, I may, on occasion, visit you in your world.” \r\n\r\nThe next thing I remember was waking up. I groggily grabbed my phone, although I didn’t really need to. It was daylight outside, and I had slept through breakfast. I calculated it up, I was out for like 10 hours straight. But I did not feel rested at all. My mind was hazy, still struggling to comprehend what I had just experienced. Five nights later, the Hat Man would visit me for the first time on this plane of existence. I was watching TV and listening to some music on my phone. My earbuds flooding my ears with the sounds of ‘Voodoo Child (Slight Return)’. It was pretty late, around the time when I’d start to drift off to sleep. Suddenly, his demonic voice cut through the music in my head…\n\r\n“I visited Hendrix, once. Ironically, the night before he passed. I tried to warn him of his impending death, but he ignored me. He accused me of not being real. He said I was ‘Killing his buzz, man.’ “\n\r\nHe imitated Hendrix’s voice with the last part to a scarily accurate impersonation. \n\nI ignored it the best I could.\n\r\n“I could tell you how you die.” He continued. \n\r\nThis piqued my interest a bit, “Is that so?” I responded. \n\r\n“Yeah.” There was a long, uncomfortable pause, “Buuut, I’m not gonna.” He teased me. \n\r\n“Why are you here, then?” I asked. \n\r\n“Do you not remember, I told you I’d visit you in your realm some day, and I can do whatever I want.” \n\r\nI didn’t respond, just focused on trying to fall asleep, but it seemed as if he was still here, just staring at me. It felt like hours, I laid there awake. Until, when I woke up in the morning, not even remembering falling asleep. I wanted to get more accounts of this entity and hopefully figure out how to make stop. I read a post comparing the shadow realm to liminal spaces like that of the backrooms. It's like it exists everywhere and nowhere at the same time. I stumbled upon a blog called, ‘The Hat Man Project’, which detailed several encounters with this entity. The overwhelming majority being negative and off-putting. These stories dated from the mid 2000s up to and including stories from this year. After thoroughly scaring the shit out of myself, I started doing my best to ignore those feelings and not think about that stuff anymore. \r\n\r\nMy reprieve from the Hat Man would only last a few nights, maybe a week later, my night meds were just starting to lull me into a sleepy state, I was relaxing, watching a basketball game on the TV. \n\r\n“The Lakers are going to lose, y’know?”\n\r\nI was now wide awake, a chill running up my spine, only I couldn’t see him, just hear him. \n\r\n“Not now, dude, I’m sleepy”. Was all I remember muttering. \n\r\nFor the record, the Lakers did, in fact, lose the game. This was very quickly becoming a nuisance that I had absolutely no control over. I drifted off into an inky black darkness, a whirlwind of shadows. Strange voices then surrounded me. The voices were hard to make out, but it was like taunting me, “He’s gonna get you, you’re gonna die there.” Being repeated over and over in different tones, maybe even different languages. Next, I felt a countless amount of hands touching me, scratching, pinching me, shaking me, groping me. I swear one of those bastards even poked me in the eyes – three stooges style – You get me, right? I felt my heart racing like it might beat right out of my chest. \r\n\r\nI woke up in a cold sweat, still heaving for air. Without a doubt, it was the most frightening experience of my life. It was still mostly dark outside, I checked my phone, it was 6:03 in the morning, and the sky was just starting to brighten. Were you aware, that there’s been as many as 400,000 reports of seeing the Hat Man since the internet has been recording written experiences, but none that I read seemed as intense, or petrifying as the one I just had. It took a few days for me to fully get over what happened that night. I still can’t really think about it without getting a terrible case of goosebumps. It didn’t really help that, I always feel very isolated here, especially at night. My room at the facility is pretty close to the same layout of a decently priced hotel room. There’s a counter with a shelf, a drawer, and a cabinet. There’s a microwave on the counter and a mini fridge underneath. I have a full bathroom with a drain on the floor, making it basically a showering area with a shower head and emergency call button on the wall. There’s a small closet, a dresser built into the wall, a nightstand, and a couple of chairs for visitors. The bathroom area had an light that was always on, and on several occasions, the bathroom door was left open for a little extra light to help the staff to see when they come in to empty my catheter, or take vitals without having to turn on the bright overhead lights. \r\n\r\nSo one night, that cascade of light coming from the bathroom just felt off. There was a slight electric feeling in the air, and an unusually cold breeze stirred around. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a black silhouette pass by that wedge of light leaking from the bathroom. Before I could turn my head to get a better look, the shadow was gone. You guys know how you can feel a presence even if you can’t see it. That’s exactly how this was. The feeling never really left, I just became used to it, I guess. When I drifted off to sleep, I sunk directly into a dream. I was walking through a suburban housing community, and every house was very similar in size and shape. Equally distanced street lights peppered the sidewalks. It felt like an idyllic place to live, probably upper-middle class, if I had to guess. The lawns were all neatly kept, bushes, and trees appeared to be immaculately pruned. The moon looked enormous in the clear night sky, not a cloud to be seen. Suddenly, every front door on every house opened at once, and slowly, but steadily, the home's occupants shambled out into the quiet night. \r\n\r\nThey walked out to the edge of the sidewalk and gazed up to the moon. In unison, they began to scream an ungodly howl – unlike anything I’d ever heard before, not animalistic, just haunting. At once, every person started to gesticulate. It somewhat resembled the jerky and erratic movements of that little girl in ‘The Ring’ movie. This was beyond unnerving, how just minutes earlier, this place was so peaceful and unassuming. I tried to hide, as to, not draw their attention, I ducked behind a tree, and inadvertently snapped a limb, causing the entire community to look in my direction. Their heads all tilted to the side, and their jaws started to come unhinged from their cheeks. They began to shuffle towards me, repeating, “Get the interloper.” Over and over again. I hadn’t even noticed that the moon was no longer in the sky. Now, it was nearly pitch blackness engulfing me. Just then, a wispy mist cut between the approaching crowd and myself, slowly evolving into a wall of this kinda cloudy darkness. Out of the cloud stepped the Hat Man, and as soon as the people laid eyes on him, they stopped dead in their tracks. \r\n\r\nThe Hat Man raised his arms in a threatening gesture, and the crowd quickly dissipated back to their houses. I didn’t know whether to feel relieved or even more panicked. He didn’t turn to me. It was like shifted himself, front to back to face me. His eyes, like lasers burning directly into my soul, he sort of floated towards me. Are you guys familiar with the idea of the ‘uncanny valley’, it’s like seeing something that’s almost human, but only not quite. That’s the eerie feeling I got looking into the Hat Man’s eyes. I was frozen in place again, unable to move, no matter how much I tried. He kept moving towards me, and just before he could touch me, he vanished, and I abruptly woke up. I was back in my bed at the nursing home, shaking uncontrollably. A cold sweat soaked my pillow. I glanced at my phone. It had only been a little more than an hour since I had fallen asleep. It would be the last wink of sleep I’d get that night. I pulled up my laptop and continued watching old episodes of the ‘X-Files’ until morning. It’s like a comfort show to me, oddly enough. The first rays of the morning sun greeted me like an old friend, and I felt safe again. \r\n\r\nThe last and most recent experience came just a few nights ago. I was just doing my thing, watching TV, and there he was, in the corner just behind me. I only noticed when I saw his reflection on the TV screen. As soon as I was aware of his presence, I felt my chest tighten, and a nervous feeling came over me. The Hat Man started to speak to me.\n\r\n“Hello friend.”\n\r\n“Friends don’t stalk each other, and scare the shit outta them” – I thought. \n\r\n“Clearly you’ve never seen ‘Scare Tactics’, that’s literally the premise of the show.” – His voice leaned towards the evil, demonic one.\n\r\nHe was right, “Fair enough” – I admitted.\n\r\n“But why me, don’t you have other people to terrify?” I asked.\n\r\nHe made a kind of laughing sound, “I do. It’s just your turn.” – The evil voice continued. \n\r\n“What can I do to make you leave me alone?” – I thought. \n\r\nAgain, he made the laughing sound, “You came uninvited into my realm, and that gives me permission to attach to you. You can’t get away from me. And like I’ve already told you, I’ll visit you whenever I see fit. The only thing you can do is get used to it.” \n\r\nThe weight on my chest became heavier, tightening around my heart. I did my best to ignore it again, and after, who knows how long I fell asleep. And that’s it, for now.\r\n\nI may post further updates on future encounters, depending on how interesting and scary they are.",

        "text": "\n\nTo set the tone, I always hated the town I lived in. I moved there alone when I was 18 for college and quickly regretted it. It was a decent sized town but full of not decent people. Nearly every gas station was robbed frequently, there were shootings in broad daylight, robberies, you name it. \n\nWell for the first 3 years I lived with roommates on a side of town that wasnt awful, but it was sketchy. So when I was making decent enough money I moved out on my own. \n\nThe house was tiny. Maybe 500 sqft if that, super old and poorly built. It was just me living there so I didn't mind how small it was - but what originally sold me was that it was in the middle of nowhere. It was surrounded by a bunch of fields and some wooded areas with only a few houses nearby.  Considering I hated being in the town due to the continuous paranoia of getting mugged or shot, I loved the idea of living out there. \nSo at the beginning of July I moved in. Everything seemed super swell minus not being able to get good internet. A month goes by and everything is still swell to me, and I decided to get a dog to keep me company. He also loved the place, and spent long amounts of time lounging about the yard and trying to convince the nearest neighbor to walk over and pet him. (Important later)\n\nRoughly 2 months into living there I started to notice things out of place. (Something to note is that an old roommate of mine was using my spare room as a storage space until he got moved himself, so he had a key but was never there. He just kinda popped in once every other week to grab something and usually let me know beforehand. ) \nBut I'd come home to my kitchen chair being pulled away from my table, or a bowl in the sink, things like that. They were such small things I wrote it off as my roommate swinging by or just stuff i was forgetting. But then my dog developed this crazy bad separation anxiety. Up until now he didn't even care when I left, he'd just lay on the couch and chew his toys. He never barked, never did anything weird. However, all of a sudden he began acting really awful every time I tried to leave. He'd literally cram his body through the door as I was  closing it, screaming and barking and wouldn't stop until I came back in the house. He didn't want me to leave him there alone. At all.  \n\nI couldn't afford a kennel for him yet so I decided one day that I'd put a movie in while I was out, thinking maybe the sound of people talking might keep him calmed down. I only had to finish one task up at work and knew I'd be home early, so I put in a copy of Hamlet. I know, boring, but I chose it because the copy I have is 5 hours long. I knew it would be playing when I came back. \n\nFlash forward 3 hours, long before Hamlet should have been over but when I walked in the door not only was the movie not playing, but the TV and the xbox were completely off.  \nI immediately called my \"roommate\" and asked if he had been over, and he wasn't even in town. I explained the tv situation to him and he shrugged it off as the tv powering off when it idles for awhile. \nEven though this is true, there are several reasons I know this isn't the case. \n1. It wasn't idling. A 5 hour movie was supposed to be playing. \n2. Even if it had shut off, my Xbox wouldn't have. I have left it on by accident for weeks I was gone out of town or whatever and it was still on when I came home. Always. But it was completely powered down this time. \n\nThe weird thing is none of my stuff was missing and the door was locked when I entered. I eventually convinced myself that it was something weird with the Xbox or whatever and shrugged it off. That is until my dog started acting even weirder. Remember earlier I mentioned he used to play with the neighbor? Well all of a sudden if she even walked by the house while he was out he'd start yelping and running at me away from her. This was incredibly weird to me, and made me incredibly cautious of her. \n\nI put some cheap alarms on my doors, (the kind that go off when the door is opened ) and slept with my pistol handy. The second night the alarms were on my doors I was woken up by the one on the back door going off.  I flew out of bed with my pistol, trying to convince myself that I was about to shoot some intruder, but once I got to the door it was shut and there was nobody there. The alarm had been knocked all the way across the room. The door would have had to opened for it to be chucked like that. It couldn't have fallen off and landed there.\nSomething else weird, the door was locked. But not the way I had locked it. I always locked the knob AND the deadbolt, but upon checking my lock after this, only the door knob was locked. \nThe police wouldn't do much as I had no witnesses, no lead, and they didn't have much to go on. \n\nNeedless to say I changed the locks. I didn't have any noticable problems inside after that, but later found out that the \"close neighbor\" that my dog hated had previously lived in the house I was renting, and the locks had never been changed. \nI have no way to prove my theory but it's pretty obvious she had a key and was coming and going as she pleased. Why though I can't figure out. Nothing of mine ever went missing. \nThe most unsettling part for me though is that she had tried to come in at night until the alarm scared her off. How many times has she been in my house at night while I was asleep....and why???",

        "text": "When I was about 15, my family of six lived in an extremely small rented house. A brief on how my house was that it had two bedrooms upstairs and a bathroom and downstairs a small guestroom. With kitchen and a basement door.. Due to lack of rooms me and my 3 siblings were forced to share in one room and my parents on the other one.\n\nBeing the eldest I would easily get pissed whenever I was tired of my siblings I would sleep downstairs. One night I am lying on the couch I had pushed the couch to the window wall and watching the sky through the window.. Scrolling through my phone my dad had gifted me the last Christmas,this incident took place in march or april as far as I remember then a face shows up in the window illuminated by a lighter. I freeze, and the face goes away. I’m pretty relieved, thinking it was maybe our druggie neighbours...seeing if my parents were still awake as soon as I tried getting up from my couch the face shows up again. I tried and wanted to scream but when I tried I was not able to, not even a sound. The person looked at me and knew immediately i was seeking for help, and wasin distress he hurries  to open the window but as it was locked he sprints towards the front to break the door. \n\n\nAs he started banging at it he was pushing so hard that by the force of it one can easily say that the lock won't stay on for more I took the opportunity ran upstairs and started screaming and calling my dad! My parents as soon as they saw me immediately knew something was wrong, but my dad was sharp enough to hear the bangs of the door he bolted to our room and was able to get the baseball bat and as soon as he shouted at the guy to stop banging the door he managed to break into our house, being dark downstairs we couldn't figure out where he went... But it was for sure he was not in the guestroom, my dad without caring about his safety gets downstairs.... By this point I was instructed by my mom to get into our room with siblings she made sure our Windows were locked, blinds down and locked from outside, I don't know what happened after that but their were a lot of shouts and screams from my dad, after 10 minutes we could here the cops car pulling in front of our porsch, they were able to catch the guy and arrest him my dad was later escorted to the hospital as he was bruised, later known that the guy tried to stab my dad but in a tough fight my dad injured his right arm, its from that day I have gained a lot of respect and appreciation for my dad\n\n\nBut this is something which I've even dreamt of sometimes",

        "text": "After confirming that Jeremy was indeed out cold, Aleksei swung him over his shoulder and carried him out into the snow, where he unceremoniously dropped him. Casimir had warned the employees not to approach the house for a while. We didn't want them to get caught up in the fight that was sure to ensue. The three of us waited on the porch, eyes trained on the motionless body of our wayward brother. \n\nThe Leshy started smoking a pipe (no idea where he got that from), I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes and Cas was typing away on his phone, lifting his head every five seconds to check on Jem. All of a sudden, he readjusted his grip on the device and slammed it onto the floor. I jumped, and Cas took a step back, staring at the phone with wide eyes. \n\n\"What the fuck!\" he whisper-shouted. \"I… I didn't wanna do this!\"\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"I didn't wanna do this! I just… suddenly… got, like, an *impulse*, I don't even know—\"\n\n\"The Bies,\" I said quietly.\n\n\"It's here,\" Aleksei confirmed, tucking his pipe away. His voice was low and stern, the look in his eyes steely.\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\nMy brother and I spoke at the same time when we realized that Jeremy had *moved*. His limp body has been pulled up into a sitting position, his legs below him, his head tilted back to gaze heavenward. His eyes had rolled back, leaving only white and sore red. Slowly, he drew himself up, his movements resembling those of a puppet manipulated through unseen strings. I stared at him with bated breath, needing a moment to get a grip on myself as my heart began to race. Jeremy staggered to his feet, looking kind of like a zombie from a movie. His eyes came back down to focus on us, the glare from within them intense, unyielding and absolutely murderous. \n\n\"Well, this is… alarming,\" Cas muttered, suppressing a nervous chuckle. I could tell he was just as stricken with fear as me.\n\nGritting my teeth, I sucked in a deep breath, bracing myself. \"Alright, let's move while he's still dazed! We can't let him get the jump on us. If either of you feel him in your heads, drop all weapons and get as far away from me as possible,\" I hurriedly instructed, assuming the most commanding tone I could muster.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Cas replied. He grabbed his cross necklace from the windowsill behind us, hastily looping it around his neck, then reached for his gun. \n\nI checked myself. Cross was there. I had my knife. Go-time. \n\nI lunged at Jeremy's unsteady form, and he thankfully didn't react right away, allowing me to knock him down and sit on his bare belly. The Bies let out a furious howl that sounded all too human through my brother's throat for comfort. I sank the blade into his skin, just deep enough to carve, and hastily jagged it down his chest to form the first couple lines of an upturned pentagram. Unfortunately, I didn't get much further than that. Not-Actually-Jem pushed me off, growling as he threw himself at me and began to tear at my hair, limbs and dress in a frenzy. My grip on the knife was unrelenting, and I swung it at him a few times until he grabbed my arm and pinned it down.\n\nAleksei descended upon the possessed man like a hawk, grabbing him and dragging him off of me before flinging him to the ground, sending him sprawling into the snow. I jumped to my feet, and, coughing and panting, pounced on him once more. Aleksei held him down for a few seconds as I placed the tip of the knife in the spot where I'd left off. The pentagram was almost finished, there was just one line missing, two dots yet unconnected. That's when I noticed Aleksei was starting to squirm. \n\n\"Fuck! No, no, stay with me!\" I shouted.\n\n\"It's trying to get in!\" he yelled back at me, looking more distressed than I'd ever seen him before. His eyes were wide and terrified, his jaw clenched, and he was gripping Jem's arms with a panicked, white-knuckled force.\n\n\"I'm almost done! Please, just… stay with me!\" \n\nHe cried out, a mix of a growl and a scream that reared his head back, but he didn't let go, and I drew the final line, deeper than all the ones before. Blood sprayed out as I yanked back the knife. Aleksei's eyes cleared up immediately, like the sky peeking out from behind bursting clouds. I wasted no time in pulling him to his feet. \n\n\"Stand back!\" I heard Casimir holler from behind us. \n\nI hastily moved aside, bringing the Leshy along with me. I didn't even have the time to turn and look at my brother before the gunshot rang out. Blood spattered, further tainting the snow, and Jeremy's writhing body fell still. \n\nCasimir was standing a few feet away from us, his gun still raised, his shoulders trembling. It was like he didn't dare lower his arm yet for fear the possessed man would come back to life. There was no chance of that, though. The bullet had entered Jeremy's skull at an odd, sideways angle. I couldn't bear looking at it for long. My whole body was shaking, and I felt compelled to stumble over to Cas and throw my arms around him, almost not caring that he was still holding a weapon. He immediately dropped it, fully embracing me and even pulling me up to my tip-toes to bridge our height difference. He cupped the back of my head and buried his cold face in the crook of my neck, inhaling deeply as I did the very same. His smell calmed me—not his cologne or the scent of my fabric softener he'd obviously used on his sweater, but the fragrance that laid beneath it all.\n\n\"Is that *Little Brother* by Calvin Klein?\" I asked with a faltering chuckle. \n\n\"What?\" he pressed out, snickering slightly in-between sobs. It was only then that I realized he was crying.\n\n\"No matter.\" \n\n\"You're weird.\"\n\n\"So are you.\"\n\nWe pulled apart, only for Cas to take a surprised step back, gaze trained on something behind me. \"Whoa,\" he uttered. \"Fi. Look.\"\n\nI turned around only to find that Aleksei, once more in his true form, had grown to easily seven times his size. His antlers branched into the skies as though they were trees of their own, his huffing snout sent forth clouds of warm breath as big as my head and each of his paws was the width of a tree trunk. Without warning, he wrapped a wooden claw around me, picking me up to hold before his eyes. They were shining like twin stars. For a moment, we just stared at each other. It felt like my heart was overflowing.\n\n\"How're you feeling?\" I asked, a tentative smile tugging on my lips. \n\nHis voice rumbled like a thunderclap. *\"Excellent. You've done right by me, heiress. I'm… grateful.\"*\n\n\"I had to,\" I replied by way of explanation. Daring a glance below, I saw Casimir looking up at us in awe. I kicked my feet a little; it felt like I was flying.\n\n*\"I did not force your hand,\"* the Leshy argued. \n\n\"Of course not. But I still had to. I mean, it's *you.* You're my home. You're everything.\"\n\nHe gently sat me back down in the snow, then laid down to get on eye level with us. He reminded me strangely of a resting fawn. *\"I have not felt this good in a long time,\"* he admitted. *\"What do you intend to do now, Fiona?\"*\n\nIt took me a while to get over his use of my name and the fact that he seemed to be willingly awaiting instructions. Not being out of my mind, I refrained from mentioning it. Standing a little taller, I allowed a smirk to creep up on my face. \n\n\"Now I'll make Tom Hayes wish he never crossed my path.\"\n\nIt's moments like this that I'm thankful to have my loyal senior employees. Knowing that Gus was currently making his rounds, I called him and explained that I was about to rely on him regarding an unsavory task that needed instant completion. He didn't even question my reasoning when I asked him to knock out Tom Hayes and bring him to me. \n\n\"Smart,\" Cas commented. \"He's not gonna get suspicious of another guard approaching him. Though I don't know if it truly would have made a difference—he seems a bit dense.\"\n\n\"Exactly why he's probably not the one who's been planning for all of this to go down. Maybe the Bies even has something to do with this. I mean, it *is* a very inconvenient coincidence for all these problems to come up at the same time,\" I thought aloud before turning to the Leshy. \"After I'm done with him…\"\n\n*\"It'll be my turn to exact justice as I see fit,\"* he completed my sentence. \n\nI smiled thinly as he turned to disappear beyond the treeline, his cheerful humming ringing out over the meadow. Casimir cleared his throat. \"God, I'm glad,\" he muttered mistily. \"I wish we could sit back and relax for just a minute after this.\" Looking down at the lifeless body of our brother, he let go of a ragged breath. \"I can't believe this.\"\n\n\"I know. That, uh… that was a great shot, though. Just by the by.\"\n\nHe gave me a wan smirk. \"Thanks. So… do we keep him lying around here, or…?\"\n\nI started. \"Right! We need a box! Shit, where do we get—\"\n\n\"I called my coffin guy earlier. He owes me a favor… He'll be here in an hour or so and drop off something for us.\"\n\n\"You have a coffin guy?\"\n\n\"I have a guy for everything, sis. Cars, suits, ill-gotten documents, gossip that can be used for defamation… I'm very well-connected, I'll have you know.\"\n\nWe returned inside where we were joined by Gus after just a few minutes. Strong as an ox, that guy. He was carrying Tom Hayes with ease, slung over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. \n\n\"Help me take him down into the basement,\" I ordered, and Gus grunted, following me down the stairs. In the basement, he dropped the unconscious man on the floor.\n\n\"There you go, Boss. Do I wanna ask?\"\n\n\"I know you do,\" I replied steadily. \"Don't worry, though. I'll tell you all about it sometime.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a tilted head before treating me to a crooked smile. \"Sure, Miss Novak.\"\n\nHe turned and went back outside where Cas was waiting to send him off with a coffee. This left me alone with Tom. I took the time to bind his wrists and ankles together using zip ties, then I sat down beside him and started to shake him by the shoulders. Getting him to wake up was rather difficult. At first he didn't respond at all, but he eventually began to stir and moan. When I gave him a final slap across the face, his eyes flew open, darting around in confusion before settling on me. They widened in horror when the veil lifted. \n\n\"Shit.\" \n\n\"Yeah, that about sums it up,\" I replied, nodding in agreement. \"Your situational awareness astounds me.\"\n\n\"I-if you hurt me, I'll kill the white rabbit!\" \n\nI frowned. \"Tom, I already have it back. I'd be taking a huge risk pulling this stunt otherwise, don't you think?\" \n\nHis lip quivered. \"No… no, how'd you…\"\n\n\"Somebody retrieved it for me. How do you not know the rabbit's gone? Where were you keeping it?\"\n\n\"I wasn't! H-he was. I just… I didn't have it. He did, all along. I don't even know shit about souls, I just wanted to make some cash!\"\n\n\"I pay you enough, why betray me?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I dunno. It was cash.\"\n\n\"So you're saying somebody hired you?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Okay, Tom. How about you just tell me everything.\"\n\n\"I'm not supposed to.\"\n\n\"Tom, I have literally kidnapped you and am holding you prisoner. Whoever hired you can't help you. Your job right now is to convince me not to kill you,\" I explained slowly, holding his gaze. \"And to hurt you less.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't do that!\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? Just a sec. I think… it's around here somewhere…\" I held up a finger, then turned on my heel and started rummaging through the boxes behind us. I had thrown a lot of my old stuff down here, including some things I used to use back when I was with Jacek. These items were of too much sentimental value to throw away, but keeping them in my room wasn't an option anymore as looking at them caused me pain… a different kind than what they were intended for. Whirling back around, I held up two thin, long black objects, one in each hand. \"What do you think? Cat o' nine tails or riding crop?\"\n\nHayes' jaw dropped.\n\n\"Come on, I'm giving you the choice here,\" I encouraged him. \"Or I've got other stuff, too, if you'd prefer.\"\n\nHe just started screaming. \n\nI sighed deeply. \"This isn't getting us anywhere, Tom. Talk. It's as easy as that. I don't wanna have to resort to this. It's no fun if the other person's not into it.\"\n\n\"Fine! Fine, okay! Jesus! You're crazy!\"\n\nI smiled, lowering the whips. \"I'm listening.\"\n\n\"Okay, so… This guy came up to me one day. Completely outta nowhere. He just showed up at my apartment. And he told me to post a bunch of shit online about the woods, and to set up cameras and upload videos, too… He gave me this weird-ass cage with the rabbit inside. There were a bunch of symbols on it. Some kinda spell to keep that thing from running off. Anyways, he made me keep it at my place to watch and said I should use it as leverage if you ever were to find out.\" \n\nThe words spilled from his lips like water from a broken dam. I kept a close eye on his face. He seemed to be telling the truth. \n\n\"Anyways, after you called us in to talk about the cameras, I wrote the note, and then I kinda just didn't know what to do for a couple days… I was getting nervous; I was afraid you'd find out or… or *something*. I kept second-guessing everything, and then I ended up calling that man. I got him to take back the rabbit and store it elsewhere, cuz I had a feeling you might try to get to it. And that's basically it.\" He looked up at me with wide eyes, awaiting judgment. \n\n\"Who was he?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"The man, dumbass! Who was he? Didn't he give you a name?\"\n\n\"John Smith. Obviously fake, but I didn't care. I just took the money he handed me when he came over.\"\n\n\"What's he look like?\"\n\nTom thought for a moment. \"In his late sixties, I'd say. Tall, kinda built. Bit of a bird's nose. Green eyes…\" He trailed off. \"That's all I got, really.\"\n\nFor a moment, I didn't say anything. Then, I turned around once more to look through some other boxes. I finally produced an old photo album which I leafed through, stopping at a specific picture taken several years ago. I fished it out to hold in front of Tom's face. He craned his head to examine it.\n\n\"Could that be him?\" I inquired, my throat bone dry. \n\n\"Yes! Yes, I-I think so!\" Tom nodded eagerly. \n\n\"Okay,\" I said calmly. \"Then I guess we're done here.\" I grabbed Tom and dragged him to his feet, forcing him to half-stagger, half-crawl up the stairs. Behind the basement door, Cas was waiting for us, his laptop at the ready. We took Tom by the arms and carried him over to the couch where we had him sit down. My brother cut his hands free, then shoved his laptop into his arms. \n\n\"There. Log into your accounts and delete *every* single thing you ever posted about us. In fact, delete the accounts, too,\" he commanded. \n\nNot in the mood for backtalk anymore, Tom went straight to work. Meanwhile, I went back downstairs to tidy up the mess I'd made in the basement, bringing the photo album with me upon my return. It took Tom Hayes an hour to wipe his social media clean of the crap he'd been spouting. When he was done, Cas cut his ankles loose, too, and Tom sighed in relief.\n\n\"Can I go now?\"\n\n\"Hayes, you're responsible for several deaths. It's because of you that the safety of our property and the creatures dwelling within it was compromised,\" Casimir said slowly, each word rolling off his tongue with grave emphasis. \n\nUnderstanding once more forced its way into Tom's features. \"Wh-what are you gonna do to me?\" \n\n\"Nothing,\" I answered plainly, helping him up. \n\n\"Am I fired?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Just get back to your spot and walk your route.\" \n\nHe eyed me with suspicion, but still moved to walk out the door. I followed, stopping on the porch to look after him as he headed for the edge of the forest. He didn't make it very far. Before he was halfway across the red meadow, a massive shape parted from the trees and gigantic, branch-like claws descended on the now screaming man. He tried to run, but it was useless. The Leshy closed his hand around him, lifting him into the air not unlike he'd done me. There was nothing gentle or careful about it this time, though. The wood-demon threw his head back, opening his mouth before dropping the squirming man down his maw. A crunch of bone, a spatter of blood to color the snow. A cry of pain and panic breaking off abruptly. \n\nThat was the last anyone ever saw or heard of Tom Hayes. \n\nI returned into the house with a long, soft sigh. Casimir was waiting for me on the sofa, long limbs stretched out, one hand in his hair. \"I took care of the body while you were downstairs,\" he announced. \"But we're gonna have to dig a pretty large hole pretty soon. I don't think Jeanette likes sharing her stable with a coffin. Has Hayes been… dealt with?\"\n\n\"The High King of the forest has exacted his revenge,\" I muttered grimly, feeling rather like the narrator of a creepy old fairy tale. \n\nCasimir nodded. \"Alright then. I'm dreading to ask, but we both know I have to. So. What did you find out?\"\n\n\"Tom really *was* hired by someone.\"\n\n\"Someone we know?\"\n\n\"Someone who hates me.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nI dropped down beside him. \"Dad.\"\n\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1095w2g/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_freak_deer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a5ij3/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10b1dy9/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cac2n/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10dbk6i/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_devil/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ebyr1/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_sauna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fa2ec/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h64is/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_aleksei/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 18](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10i0d0p/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_when_shit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10jbwml/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10k7aqw/im_a_software_engineer_and_ive_never_seen_cables/",
        "text": "As a software engineer, I had seen cables that ranged from as thin as a quarter of an inch in diameter to thicker than the width of my thumb. I had also seen red ones, blue ones, green ones; almost every color of the rainbow. I had never seen cables like the ones I saw that day. \n\nAlso, I had met many cable installers (aka cablers). Most of them had chill, laid-back, and friendly attitudes. Others seemed to care more about their work but managed to have small conversations with customers to maintain professionalism. The cable installer my company hired that day did not have any of these traits. \n\nI didn't need a degree in psychology to know this guy didn't run on the same operating system as the rest of them. When the rest of his face sat in a neutral position, his eyes still had a certain excitable spark behind them. It was as if his mind could never rest. \n\nAlso, his arms and legs seemed beyond his control. They seemed to pull him in different directions against his will. I noticed this most when I shook his hand and it seemed to push mine forward toward the cable room behind me. \n\nHe also wasn't very sociable. I greeted him and he greeted me. I told him my boss wanted me to watch his work. He said that was alright. Then he moved past me into the cable room. Most professionals, I believe, wouldn't have acted like this. \n\nHis behavior didn't bother me, however. I welcomed it. When my boss told me to keep an eye on the cabler (apparently there had been a case of someone slacking off), conversations were the first things that my mind began to dread. \n\nThe second was having to give up the pleasure that I felt while coding for a few hours. I could get so 'in the zone' that I could go hours into overtime without looking up. All the world would just slip away. I'd forget about my problems like the fights I'd have with my wife about staying at work late, heh heh. \n\nThe cabler seemed to have the same attitude as me about his job. The man dropped the boxes he had carried into the cable room with rhythmic thunks. He then pulled out all the cables and made thwapping sounds as he slapped them onto the floor. It took him three minutes to get them all out. In another few minutes, he had plugged over 50 cables. All the while, I caught a blissful look on his face. \n\nAs he worked, I got a good look at the cables. They seemed to have diameters of about half an inch thick. That was the only normal feature about them. Color-wise, they all had patterns like stripes and polka dots on them. Shape-wise, they seemed to naturally hold curves rather than laying straight. This made the cable network look like a chaotic mess. \n\nBy the time I realized this cabler could be a fraud and/or prankster, the man had already plugged in a few hundred cables. As I went over to confront him, that's when I noticed it. The cables were moving on their own. They made snake-like jerking motions back and forth. It seemed as though they wanted to free themselves from their plug-ins. \n\n\"Um, sir,\" I said. \"Should they be doing that?\" \n\nThe cable installer turned to me and then looked where I was pointing. His eyes grew wide and his hands shot forward. Each grabbed a handful of the cables. Unfortunately, the speed of the motion only resulted in him freeing these cables from their plugs. Their freed ends began convulsing wildly, stabbing the air and throwing themselves about. Many of them scratched the cabler's skin and caused it to bleed. As the flurry of cables continued, I just managed to notice that the drops of blood disappeared each time a cable end dropped down.   \n\nSoon, one of the cables managed to orient itself so that when it hit the cabler's skin, it pierced right through it. The cabler grunted and let go of the cables. He tried to pull the cable out. Under his fingers, I saw the sections of the cable bulge and shrink. It was drinking. \n\nMore cables plunged into the cabler's arms in rapid succession. Ones that had fallen to the floor pierced his legs. The moment that they stabbed him, they began drinking. \n\nI swore and rushed forward. I grabbed the cables attached to each of his arms and yanked at them, but they wouldn't budge. As I continued to try, some of the still free cables turned to me and began stabbing at my arm. I dodged them for as long as I could, but one managed to dive into my wrist and straight through the bone. \n\nI let out a wail, let go of the other cables, and tried to free my wrist. The cabler reached forward and tore the cable out of me, leaving a bloody hole. Then he pointed to the door. \n\n\"Go,\" the cabler said. \n\n\"But-,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't worry about me. This is my job. And I love it.\" \n\nI crept backward because his statement had bewildered me. As I did, more cables freed themselves from their connectors and made beelines for the cabler. As they all began piercing his flesh, he didn't make a sound. He sank into a sitting position, laid back until his shoulders hit the floor, and sighed. With my heart in my throat, I rushed to get my boss. \n\nBy the time we got back there, the cables and cabler had disappeared. They couldn't even find any trace of either of them on the security footage. All that they saw was me, looking and reacting to seemingly nothing. \n\nIt was deemed that I had had a nervous breakdown and, to my horror, I was given two weeks' leave. When I tried to use the bloody hole in my arm, which somehow remained, as proof of my sanity, they dismissed it as a self-inflicted wound. \n\nDuring those two weeks, I spent a holiday in the warmth of a tropical sun and amongst the beauty of tropical flowers. While I was there, I thought a lot about the incident. The day I got back to work, I handed in my [two weeks' notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/frerkinghorrorstories/)",

        "text": "It all started a few weeks ago. I would be fast asleep and suddenly, my phone would ring. I would groggily pick up, only to hear silence on the other end. I thought it was just a wrong number or a prank call, so I didn't think much of it. But then it started happening every night, at exactly 3am. I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching me, it was always at the back of my mind and I couldn't help but feel a knot in my stomach every time my phone rang.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I would just let it ring and go back to sleep. But then the caller started to say things. Things that made my blood run cold. They would say things like \"You're just getting home from work, aren't you?\" or \"You're in the kitchen, making yourself a sandwich.\" How could they possibly know that? It's like they're watching me. Every time I heard their voice, my heart would race and my palms would sweat. I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching my every move.\n\nI started to feel like I was being stalked. I changed my phone number, but the calls still came through. I even unplugged my phone at night, but they still managed to get through. I don't know what to do. I'm scared to be alone in my own home. I've even started sleeping with a baseball bat next to my bed, just in case. I couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched and I couldn't help but feel like I was going to be attacked at any moment. It was affecting my work, my relationships, and my mental health. I was constantly on edge, and every time I heard a ringtone, my heart would race and I couldn't help but feel a wave of anxiety wash over me.\n\nI've tried to talk to my friends and family about it, but they think I'm just being paranoid. But I know what I'm hearing and I know it's real. I don't know who is doing this to me or why, but I just want it to stop. It's affecting my work, my relationships, and my mental health. I just want to feel safe again. I just want to be able to sleep peacefully without the constant fear of someone watching me. The feeling of being stalked and harassed was overwhelming and I couldn't shake it off. It was a constant battle and I felt like I was losing. The fear of the unknown and the constant unknown calls was eating me from the inside and I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI started to investigate, trying to find out where the calls were coming from. But every time I tried to trace the call, it would be untraceable. It was like the caller was always one step ahead of me. I tried to change my number again but it made no difference. I even went to the police but they couldn't help me either. They told me there was nothing they could do unless the caller made a direct threat to me.\n\nThe calls continued, and they became more and more frequent. They were no longer just at 3am but at all hours of the day and night. I was starting to lose my mind. I couldn't focus on anything else. I was constantly thinking about the caller and the calls. It was affecting my work, my relationships, and my mental health. I was becoming more and more isolated and paranoid. I couldn't trust anyone. I was scared to tell anyone about the calls, fearing they would think I was crazy.\n\nEventually, I couldn't take it anymore. I was at the end of my rope. I was  \n\nabout to snap. I decided to confront the caller. I stayed up all night, waiting for the next call to come through. And finally, at 3am, my phone rang. I answered, and a voice on the other end said \"You're awake, I can hear you breathing.\" I was shaking with fear and anger. I screamed into the phone \"Who are you? Why are you doing this to me?\" But there was only silence on the other end. I couldn't take it anymore, I hung up the phone and broke down in tears.",

        "text": " \n\nI spent much of my childhood growing up in a grand old house nestled in the countryside. It had been in my family for generations and held a special place in my heart. However, as I got older, I began to notice strange occurrences happening within the walls of the home. At first, I dismissed them as nothing more than creaky floorboards and the wind blowing through the old windows. But as I grew older, the occurrences became more frequent and difficult to ignore.\n\nOne summer, when I was visiting the house as an adult, I decided to spend the night alone in the house. I was curious to see if I would experience any of the strange occurrences that I remembered from my childhood. As I settled in for the night, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. I chalked it up to my imagination and tried to ignore it.\n\nBut as the night went on, the feeling of being watched became stronger. And then I heard it, a faint whispering coming from the hallway. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but as the whispering grew louder and more distinct, I realized it was a voice. But not one that I recognized - it seemed to be coming from nowhere and everywhere at once.\n\nI quickly got up and walked towards the hallway, but as soon as I stepped out of the living room, the whispering stopped. I searched the entire house but found nothing. I assumed it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, so I returned to the living room and locked the door. But the whispering started again. This time, it was coming from inside the room. I couldn't see anyone but I could hear the voice as clear as day. It was then that I noticed something even more unsettling - the photos in the album had started to change. Faces that were once smiling were now twisted in terror, and images that were once peaceful now showed signs of destruction.\n\nI knew then that I had to leave the house. I grabbed my things and fled into the night, never looking back. I've never returned to that house since, but the memory of that night still haunts me to this day.\n\nAs I reflect on the events of that night, I can't help but wonder if there was something sinister at play within the walls of my childhood home. I've never shared this experience with anyone before, but something about that house still draws me in. I can't shake the feeling that whatever was there is still there, waiting for me to return.\n\nAfter this experience, I started to research the history of the house and the land it was built on. I found out that it was built in the early 1800s and it has been passed down through generations of my family. I also found out that there were rumors of strange occurrences and ghostly sightings in the area. But what really caught my attention was that the land where the house was built was once a burial ground for an indigenous tribe. I couldn't help but wonder if the strange occurrences and ghostly sightings were connected to this history.\n\nI contacted a local historian and he confirmed that the rumors were true. He also told me that the tribe believed that the land was sacred and anyone who disturbed it would be cursed. He also mentioned that a few members of my family had died under mysterious circumstances over the years.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder if the curse was real and if it was responsible for the strange occurrences in the house. I knew then that I had to find out the truth. I decided to return to the house and try to uncover the mystery.\n\nI went back to the house on a dark and stormy night, armed with a flashlight and a camera. As soon as I stepped inside, the feeling of being watched returned. I could hear the whispering again, but this time it was louder and more distinct. I could feel a cold breeze, even though all the windows and doors were closed. I knew then that something was different this time.\n\nI started to explore the house, trying to find the source of the whispering. I walked through each room, taking photos and videos, hoping to capture evidence of the strange occurrences. As I climbed the stairs to the second floor, I heard a loud thumping noise coming from one of the bedrooms. I slowly opened the door and found nothing. But as soon as I turned to leave, I felt something cold touch my shoulder. I quickly turned around, but there was no one there.\n\nI was about to leave the house when I heard a voice calling my name. It was coming from the basement. I hesitated for a moment, but my curiosity got the better of me. I opened the door to the basement and started to descend the stairs. As soon as I reached the bottom, I saw a figure standing in the corner. It was a woman with long dark hair and a traditional indigenous dress. She was holding a baby in her arms and crying. I couldn't move, I was paralyzed with fear. I could see the pain and sadness in her eyes. I knew then that she was the ghost of a mother who had lost her child.\n\nI quickly realized that the house was built on sacred land and that I had disturbed the spirits of the tribe. I knew then that I had to leave the house and never return. I quickly gathered my things and fled into the night, never looking back.\n\nI've never shared this experience with anyone before, but I felt compelled to tell my story. I hope that by sharing it, others will understand the importance of respecting the land and the spirits of those who came before us.",

        "text": "I stared at the bill [Jacque gave me last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j6j47/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_actually_made_my/) the entire bus ride home. I couldn’t comprehend what this meant. Do our custom clients know about Eleanora? Can they sense her somehow, or better yet, communicate with her? I might have finally found a way to speak with her, and walking into work today, I think she knew. In the stairwell, I felt like the walls were watching me. It wasn’t necessarily threatening, just a feeling I’ve never had before. I paused for a moment, considering an idea I had thought about late last night. I wanted to see if I could simply talk to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Eleanora?” I whispered, barely loud enough for even me to hear. A chill ran down my spine, and I heard the building creak, as if it was an old house getting hit by wind. I knew this had never happened before, and I felt like she was trying to speak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, this moment was quickly ruined, as the door opened and Corey strutted in, barely noticing me before running into me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh, good morning Harper!” She looked around, then eyed me suspiciously. “What are you doing just standing in here?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I thought I heard someone walking in, and here you are!” I replied, trying not to sound sarcastic, before quickly turning around and finishing the three story climb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was *supposed* to be just Patrick and me today, but of course, Ms. Corporate still won’t leave. I said a quick hello to him as I clocked in, and he seemed to beam at the sight of Corey. I rolled my eyes, knowing full well why he felt so comfortable and happy around her, but I couldn’t explain that to him. I wasn’t sure what would happen if I told him about what she can do while he’s under her control, but I didn’t want to find out. I simply faked my best smile at them before heading to the floor to open. The appointment board caught my eye on the way out, and I felt my heart skip a beat. This was the perfect opportunity to find out if our custom clients knew about Eleanora, and if they could communicate with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKoro was coming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow listen, I don’t necessarily trust Koro. I’ve worked with him a few times since my first custom fitting, and he’s cool, but I can not get a read on that guy. Maybe it’s the lack of facial features, or the lack of face, but I don’t know if he is fond of me or not. I think he has fully forgiven me for my initial reaction to him, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he will answer any of my questions. Regardless, if anyone is willing to break some rules, it’s Koro. He’s the kind of guy who isn’t afraid of consequences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was lost in my thoughts all day, just waiting for closing time. I didn’t even notice that a client was staring in my face, trying to ‘politely’ ask me if we had any more sizes in the back (we never do, don’t bother asking). Patrick seemed to notice I was distracted, and pulled me aside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey, you okay, kid?” He asked, and the sincerity in his voice broke my heart when I noticed the foggy look in his eyes. She had her grips on him, and I didn’t know how to stop it. I wondered if Daniel was the same way, and why Sam wasn’t, but Patrick was growing more concerned the longer I stayed in my thoughts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I’m totally fine. My cat just got sick last night, that’s all. Just a little distracted.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe seemed to believe me, and mumbled the classic Patrick half-assed apology before telling me to get it together. I tried to focus, and finally the day ended. I just about sprinted to lock the door before setting up for Koro’s appointment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright gang, I’m heading out,” Corey said, giving us both a wave. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Harper!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Actually, I’m off tomorrow,” I said, trying not to rejoice in front of her. She gave me a glare, before repeating herself, more stern this time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will see you tomorrow, *Harper.*”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Okay, see you tomorrow.” I quickly looked away, trying to avoid watching her face melt into that disgusting scowl. Looks like my day off just got canceled. Fantastic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard the door close behind her, and Patrick looked at me concerned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’ve been here a lot lately, why don’t you go home early tonight? I’ll handle the appointment.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“NO,” I basically shouted, clearly throwing him off guard. “I mean, no, it’s fine, I’m excited to see Koro. Actually, if you’d like, you can go early! I heard you telling a client about a certain big date later, and I know you’d love extra time to prep,” I teased. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Just for that, I am going to leave,” he said, trying to put on an angry face, but he was clearly excited. It was good to see some genuine emotion from him, and I hoped some time away would loosen Corey’s grip on him. He came out with his bags, and said, “Are you sure you’re good here alone? I know Koro can be… tricky.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swallowed the knot that had been forming in my throat since this morning. “Nah, he’s a good guy. I’ll be fine, go have some fun!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gave me a quick pat on the back before basically skipping out the door. I wish I could’ve enjoyed that image of him for longer, but I had other things to do. I needed to figure out the best way to slyly ask Koro what he knew without angering him (an almost impossible job in my mind).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about thirty minutes of stressing over every possible outcome, I heard the elevator ding. Out walked Koro, wearing a slightly translucent forest green three piece suit with matching top hat, which he set on top of the coat rack as he entered the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good evening, sir,” I signed, trying to keep my hands from shaking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good evening.” He looked around, and signed, “Just us tonight?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeeling fear creeping up my spine, I began to regret telling Patrick to leave. I had never been alone with Koro before, and I quickly realized how fucking stupid I was for doing this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes sir, I hope that’s alright.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paused for a moment, and I could feel him studying me. I avoided eye contact, keeping my gaze on his transparent hands instead, and finally, he signed, “I would prefer we do my fitting before you begin your questions, if that’s alright with you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy jaw dropped, and my eyes snapped to his face before I quickly looked away, embarrassed. It seems I’m not as sly as I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes, of course, sir. I apologize.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No need,” he signed, then took off his jacket and hung it below his hat. “I’m surprised you haven’t asked me sooner. I was beginning to think you were truly stupid.” I flinched at his insult as he walked in front of the mirror, adjusting his vest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“My apologies. We can start now if you’d like. What are you looking for today?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got him fitted for a burgundy tuxedo, and a matching bowtie and complimentary pocket square. He opted for a black tuxedo shirt, which I respect, but decided against the black top hat, which I found disappointing. After all was said and done, he sauntered in front of the couch and motioned for me to sit down. I obeyed, and felt like a little kid at school with this creature, my teacher, towering over me. He adjusted his jacket, then signed, “I will warn you, I am only going to answer questions I choose. I’m not going to hold your hand through what is being asked of you. I am simply indebted to your friend, so it is only fair I give you a helping hand on her behalf. You may proceed.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought carefully before starting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Is your friend Eleanora?” He corrected my fingerspelling (which he often does, and I deeply appreciate) before answering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes. That was a stupid question, but you may continue nonetheless.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why are you indebted to her?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“That is none of your concern, girl.” I could tell I upset him, so I tried to quickly move on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How do I help her?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will not answer that.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt anger flutter in my stomach, before quickly composing myself. “Who are the voices we hear when we are in her world?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Finally, a good question,” he started, and I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes. “Those are lost souls, people who have been taken prisoner by your company. Employees who were deemed unfit or unable to complete their duties, and were sent to travel the vast ocean of her reality. When she returns home to rest, they take refuge in her walls, finding some peace within.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How many are there?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Too many.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought about this for a moment, then remembered a question one of you asked in my previous post. “How long has this company existed?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Very good. The owner of this business has existed for longer than even myself, but she did not start this venture until 100 years ago. It started innocently, a being looking to live a life that would be viewed by you humans as productive. She really enjoyed what she did, I believe, until the war. When the economy crashed, this shop was threatened with bankruptcy. She made a decision to start investing in a different demographic; those like me, who seek the fashion of humans, but for pleasure, not necessity. She knew of Eleanora’s sentience by then, and was able to barter an agreement: keep the humans separated from those like me, who may seek to harm them, and she would keep Eleanora clean, organized, and inhabited. Soon after the war, she found herself needing to expand her business, since she could no longer make all of the fabrics and clothing on her own. Now, here we are.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a moment to process all the information he had just told me, but I could tell he was getting impatient, so I quickly asked, “Who is the owner?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will not answer that.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Where is the warehouse?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t know the answer to that. I have never been, I have no reason.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Is Corporate a being like you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paused for a moment. “She is. Not like me, per say, but a being of greater power than you, yes. I would advise you to stay away from her. She does not have anyone’s best interest in mind, least of all Eleanora.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Does Daniel know about Eleanora?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt relief wash over me. He wasn’t lying to me. Suddenly, I thought of something I hadn’t considered asking. “Is Sam like you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paused for what felt like an eternity. I thought I had signed it incorrectly and he didn’t understand, so I began again, but he put up his hand for me to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will not be answering that.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Fair enough,* I thought, but quickly moved on, hoping I hadn’t upset him. “Is there any way for me to speak to Eleanora directly?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Very good. You can, but only while she’s in her natural habitat. You must wait until the next visit, and when you hear the voices, you must go to them. You will find her in a form you can comprehend. Be warned, it may be hard to find your way back, and Eleanora waits for no one. Do not get lost.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, he walked over to the coat rack and placed his top hat on his head. “You now have all the information you need. Do not ask me these questions again. If I am asked, I will deny having given you any information. Good evening.” He tipped his hat to me, and left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stayed there for a long time, thinking about everything he had said. It was too much to process. I don’t know where my head is at right now, but two things are for sure - I need to learn more about the warehouse, and I need to be there during the next trip to the other side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j6j47/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_actually_made_my/)",

        "text": "I've posted this story once before, but in light of events and memories that I'd forgotten, I've added another 2,000+ words (for a total of over 6,500) in hopes of shedding more light on the reality I was forced to experience. Please, I beg of you, please find me. This could be my last chance.  \n\\-Cereal  \n\n\nWhen a tragedy happens, it's the most peculiar thing. There is no music to build tension. There is no foreboding, ominous presence. There isn't something stitching together inclinations that maybe anything else aside from the ordinary is ever going to transpire. The moment it does, however, the moment a cataclysm rears its foul maw and bares its fangs of grief, it comes and goes in the blink of an eye. It quickly leaves only the observers and survivors to witness the wake of its unpredictable rage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first day I witnessed him, my mother had just passed away. I was 17 when it happened, nothing more than a background character in a school full of similar souls. I remember it was a cold day in November, and there was a buzz among the students for the 4-day weekend we were granted in light of Thanksgiving. We were all eager to leave for the break but this prospect hung in the shadow of semester finals which stood between us and our reprieve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom worked as the English teacher for juniors, situated on the lowest floor of the school. The walls that edged her descending stairs were clad in exposed water and gas lines. They sat with a stark contrast against the concrete. The stairs were made of that weird rubber or maybe vinyl that all together led to a classic prison presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my science class that morning, working in a small team with my best friend and some girl we used to know. Our assignment for the day? I couldn't tell you, I can't honestly recall much else of that day except that we were working on our finals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything that ensued happened so quickly. It was awesome in the way that it was awe-inspiring, but the awe was for the abject fear that followed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I recall, we were wrapping up the evidence needed for our report when, without introduction, my ears popped like I had rolled down the window in a fast-moving car. This was immediately followed by a jarring rumble that shook the whole classroom and a deafening, concussive force that stole the breath from my lungs. A shower of water followed immediately after because the fire alarm was triggered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swiftly arose from my desk and my chair shot backward. It clattered with a startling force against the table behind me. We abandoned our finals where they were and exited down the aisle between our desks with a surprising amount of order. I noticed the piercing fire alarm as our teacher wasted no time and directed us out of the classroom. We followed orders with a deep and uncertain silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were orchestrated by the teachers like frightened animals, herded towards the nearest exit. Down the hall and to the left, downstairs to the lower level, and then outside. When I rounded the corner with my mothers' classroom coming into full view, I was greeted by a conceptual nightmare. I was suddenly and firmly frozen in place. My heart seemed to stop, and yet it was beating harder than it ever had before.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother's classroom door, blown off its hinges, lay against the opposing wall in a splintered heap. The space between the door and frame was filled with an enraged inferno, desperately and forcefully bellowing from within. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was the observer who was now left to bear witness to this wake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what I thought when I ran into that fire. I don't know if I thought I could save her like some invincible superhero or if I was simply running in because I needed to. I don't know. I broke through the wall of flame and smoke, and immediately after the door frame the fire was no longer burning. I descended the staircase in a manner fitting of an infant, erratic, frantic, and without coordination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost my footing halfway down the stairs and fell with abandon, but I was lost in adrenaline and hardly noticed, regaining my balance on the last few steps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was almost cold once I reached the bottom step. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard someone crying in the room. Even though it was almost pitch black inside the veil of smoke, a small window lit the desk where my mom would sit. The person who was wailing in apparent agony was across the room, however. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI broke out in a nervous sweat as I began my search, guided by the sound. I was gagging at the smell of burning flesh and hair. It didn't take long for my eyes to dilate to the darkness and return my gift of sight. I still wish they would have failed me just that once. The images seared themselves deep into my psyche. Burnt bodies and their wayward limbs littered the floor. Some were smoldering like paper as a thin line of bright red crawled greedily up the blacked skin and turned to ash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCatastrophic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisgusting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat mouth-watering feeling crept over my tongue as it does when you're about to throw up. I heaved at the site, barely managing to hold it down. Through a power only granted to me in the \"fight\" of \"fight or flight\", I averted my attention to the crying again coming from an overturned desk in the opposing corner of the room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"That has to be my mom.. she's still alive!\" I so naively thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached for the desk, almost tripping over the chest of a less fortunate classmate. I also heard new alarms, carbon monoxide, and dioxide detectors that survived the detonation. I wish I had listened to my gut and left the scene to the imagination, but I didn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was almost to the desk when I looked down at another body. This one was slightly larger than the rest. It didn't take long for me to understand that this was my mom. She was missing the right side of her face, her eyes showed a milky white, and her jaw was slack. She had no arm.. or leg. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother was dead at my feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crying erupted from behind the desk again, with no audible words.. just sobbing. I left my mom's side to help this person, the shock keeping the crippling sadness at bay. It hadn't fully dawned on me at this point that no one could have survived this disaster. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crying filled my head the closer I got. I was hearing it with my ears, but also my thoughts. It blocked out the sounds of the various alarms that were screaming at me to get out.. it was like I was lost in a daydream in which the crying was the focus. It blocked out everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached the desk and tentatively peered behind it. I focused on an illuminated figure curled up in the corner. He had blackened skin like the rest of them and almost no hair. He trembled, facing the corner of the wall, his body lightly convulsing like it was being electrocuted, arms held out beyond its sides with its hands limply hanging from the suspended forearms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"HEY,\" I yelled, \"We have to get out! There's a gas leak!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe figure didn't respond. I thought maybe the explosion damaged his hearing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached over to him and grabbed his hand. He stopped crying when our skin touched. The trembling mostly stopped too. He slowly started to turn his head toward me. It limply followed his neck in quick little snaps as it turned.. then I saw his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeathery skin stretched across his bony skull, and his wide eyes were like my mother's, a milky grey and white. Browned teeth showed through a slacked jaw with no lips. A withered nose sat broken upon his face. He was naked, displaying the leathery skin that continued down his nude frame. Some of the skin was sloughing off at points of stress from which an infected-looking, foul-yellowed fluid oozed forth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at him in shock, his body jerking and heaving... he shuttered as his head rocked like a newborn to face me. I looked into his eyes as he took a rattled, strained breath.. and bellowed a sound unlike any I'd ever heard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, that's not the right way to portray this sound. The sound created a feeling inside of me that wasn't exactly mine. I was forced into a feeling of absolute grief. Pure pain. I felt absolutely and completely overwhelmed with guilt unlike any I had ever known. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI threw myself back from the desk and fell upon my mother's corpse. A cloud of ash rose from her smoldering body and washed over my face as I gasped. I inhaled my mother's ash. I vomited on myself as I rose to my hands and knees to crawl away, tears streamed forth like a ruptured dam that threatened my existence. I crawled and then ran once I found my footing. I ran out of that room through the fire. I ran through the school. I ran out passed my classmates. I kept running. I ran and ran and ran until my legs couldn't carry the weight of my body and my experience anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust keep running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police found me collapsed in a local park. I remember the cold, crisp grass caressing my face, leaving behind wet stains from its melting lash in the throws of my despair. I thought I would have at least run towards home. Instead, I ran in the opposite direction. The officer that found me sat with me in the field for a while and just listened to me sob. He didn't offer me any words of advice, nor words of encouragement. He didn't rush me even when we both were shivering to our core once the cold seeped through our skin and lay with our bones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fell asleep in that field, wishing the air would escape my lungs and never return. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so tired. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI awoke when the officer drove me home. The following year, though eventful, passed by in a blur. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remained in my mother's home for a short while at the mercy of my aunt and uncle who were awarded temporary custody of me. I was offered a life insurance payout that was locked in a conservatorship. I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, however, so I'll thank my stars because my aunt didn't take my money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe pulled out the settlement as soon as it was released to her and gave me a big stack of cash. It was too much for a 17-year-old to have while attempting to remain a responsible member of society. I was also quickly awarded emancipation in light of the funding. I soon began to fuel an addiction that left the hole in my soul full of even more regrets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother few months passed by in the blink of an eye, probably because I was strung out. I was always riding a line between high and barely conscious. As anticlimactic and foreseeable as it was, I overdosed on heroin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was found by my aunt in my home, she didn't deserve to see what I had become. She was too good to be exposed to my filth. I was watching some nature documentaries when I decided I wanted another hit. I set my band, found a good vein, and pumped my body full of liquid bliss. Was it my 5th hit? 6th? More than I'd ever done before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rush came on hard. Too hard. I instantly lost my balance and collapsed on my couch, head swimming. I had passed out like that and vomited in my stupor. I think I was dying at that time. I vaguely remember my aunt's scream once she walked through the front door. I'm sure I looked just like the death I was longing for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was put through rehab and then on suicide watch once the story came to light. My therapist thought that what I saw in my mom's classroom was a manifestation of my mind, like something I created to personify the hell I was experiencing at that time. Over the next several months, I began to feel like a waste despite everyone's best efforts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy weeks turned into months, and progress became a slow burn on my road to emotional and mental recovery. No matter what I was taught, what tools I was provided, and what mental gymnastics I performed, I kept sinking deeper and deeper. The craving for substances kept its sick claws locked tightly around my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next year, I found myself clinging to a reclusive lifestyle. I had dropped out of school and became a shut-in. My life became a blur in the face of this newfound depression. I traded one vice for many more, watching porn and gaming all day, loathing my existence late into the long and lonely nights. Even in sleep, I was plagued. I had such vicious night terrors, unrelenting and boundless in their pursuit of my rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt my emotional lowest, I stopped caring to meet my basic needs. My body was constantly utilizing kyphosis to keep me alive. I was a vile wreck, becoming the personification of that which was my mind. I was a mirror of my mentality. I was losing the battle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you want to know the truth about depression? It's not some \"woe is me, I'm sad\" bullshit. Depression is the opposite of happiness. Happiness is proactive and engaging. It has to be created and earned to be nurtured and it will grow on its own. Depression is everything happiness is not. Depression comes from stagnation. Depression isn't cured and isn't wanted. It's torn into being, whether you had it from birth and sat on the genetic time bomb, or it was thrust upon you against your will. Depression is the absence of emotion that we innately use to protect ourselves. \"If I can't feel, I can't hurt.\". It's the absence of feeling the desire to care. It is apathetic. Dark and abysmal. Alone and unafflicted. I can't care to eat, I can't care to meet new people, I can't care to shower or brush my teeth. I can't care to keep up with living. I've learned and lived this hell. I hope you never have to, too. If you are? I know it's hard to care, but please talk to your friends and family, or ask someone for help. People will be there for you, you just have to find them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I digress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life started a journey in a new direction, birthed from the ruptured, hemorrhaging existence that I unknowingly came to find comfort in. It was so simple, that spark. I laughed. Not like a chuckle or a little nose smirk. A belly laugh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound was foreign to my ears. I was confused but oddly excited. I was so proud of myself. Soon after that, I went from a reanimated corpse to an animated individual. My new addiction was growth. I chased this feverishly. I built myself up and created a barricade that could withstand the deluge of my mind, I calmed the rancor that consumed me without fail. I regained control. One step at a time, hand over hand I crawled a feeble yet indomitable ascent up that mountain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew I had to depart my home to continue my emotional development. Without a second thought, I left my home to my aunt, packed up, and moved out to Florida.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHells waiting room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlorida was great for a short time. I lived in a small vacation cabin by myself in the Everglades. I established myself as a transfer student waiting until next year for my college courses to begin. This was a lie, but one I found some solace in telling. I didn't have to tell it often as no one lived around me for miles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy lot was on private property which was owned by a pleasant couple who were never home. A dense and humid forest enveloped my establishment. This was a treat for me because it gave me time to confront my introspections and ultimately contributed to my road to recovery. Sure, it was the same reclusive lifestyle but here I was free. Also, something about 80f in winter was better than I thought it would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe forest surrounding me was beautiful, lush, and vibrant. You could frequently hear the birds sing, and bugs whine late into the evening as the sun departed the sky and lay to rest beyond the western horizon. It was a welcome change from the stark nights of my hometown. I would even go fishing occasionally at an ocean-fed creek just a few minutes from my house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was exactly what I had wanted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life was mine again. The memories of that night, though painful, were easier to experience. I was nearly able to say \"I'm happy.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil I heard that crying again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe uncontrollable sobbing returned nightly as the sun passed, leaving me alone to face this manifestation.. or creature. Entity. The wailing filled my nights until I was no longer able to sleep. I could only rest during the day. The day was safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few times a week, his lonely howls would penetrate the thin walls of my home. I thought maybe the crying was just a relapse of depression.. like PTSD in soldiers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it kept getting closer.. every week the sound would get louder. I would lay awake and find myself begging for it to stop. I would listen to it and focus on it as if I was going to find some words within the rattling gasps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It was the same way it was in that school. It filled my head and blocked out everything. It forced me to feel a torrent of forgotten pain. My barricade was fracturing. My rancor was waking up. My war returned with a windfall that left me breathless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI broke so quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n So quietly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike sand in the palm of my hands, my joy slipped away through my fingers. My laugh died in my throat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night, I awoke from a nap that turned into full-blown sleep. It felt like I was awoken by something, though it was silent outside. I looked at the time, 1:26 am.. the middle of the night.. but no crying at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quickly got up and looked out of my bedroom window. Nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Maybe.. it was just a raccoon trying to get into my trash,\" I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I made myself some coffee to help keep me awake through the night. Coffee had become the only thing I would drink. I made some food.. well.. canned salted potatoes with a hint of chicken dumplings and brought it back to my room. I sat down and addressed my fears as I had tried to do on silent nights prior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately, I'd been convincing myself that maybe I'm witnessing him because I hadn't gotten over the events of that day. Maybe it was a symbol of the worst day of my life, a catalyst upon which my normalcy lay flayed in some blood eagle like fashion. Maybe it's just that my subconscious had unintentionally held onto what could have been and manifested as that in my day-to-day life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became foolishly bold at this rationalization and told myself to go open the front door like that was going to make the fear end. I figured if I had confronted the atrocity and saw that there was nothing there, I could also make it all go away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI set my food and coffee down as I arose from my seat and shuffled to the front door. There was no crying tonight, it was just calm and peaceful. I placed my face in front of the window on the door as I had been every night before, honestly not expecting to see too much aside from an eerie shadow. But there it was, staring through the little glass window back at me. Face-to-face. Separated by not even half an inch of glass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn eruption of screams washed away the silence and shook my house. My kitchen light showed through and illuminated his face. It's a face I can never forget. His jaw was chattering, gaping, and closing between breaths. As he exhaled, a sticky fog clung in Rorschach patterns to the otherwise unblemished glass. His eyes stared straight ahead at nothing as though he was lost in the grip of indefinite madness. He quivered again as he took several slow, unsteady steps backward and crouched on the ground just feet from my door. He was real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed at him out of reaction. It was guttural and primitive. There were no words I could offer my emotions to appease this sickening sensation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was angry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was scared. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was sick of not sleeping, not having MY life! I moved across this god damned country to get away from THIS and here it was, huddled up near feet from the only comfort I had left. This was some sick fucking joke my brain was playing on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" I managed to yell, my voice cracking as I started to sob. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE!\" my voice sounded more like a caged dying animal, unrefined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt kept screaming outside of the house as it rose to its feet again. Standing upright, it walked in slow and sporadic movements back towards my door.. it arched awkwardly backward like the abdominal muscles lost the ability to keep the torso upright, tearing the skin as it leaned. Yellow liquid again seeped from the wounds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE\" I yelled again with a level of emotion I hadn't felt in years, but my plea fell on rotted and deaf ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt reached my door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had rehearsed this moment in my earlier days of coming to the forest. Over and over I would think about what I would do to end my maddening reality. I didn't want to kill myself though, so I had made this \"thing\" the effigy upon which my mental decline rested, and that which should be eradicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my panic and on instinct, I grabbed at the fire axe hanging above my table and mechanically threw my body at the thin door that separated us.\n\nA wordless and loud scream of fear, disgust, and hatred erupted from between my clenched teeth when I crashed through my door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat thing was hit by the door, the force unapologetically colliding with it. It fell backward, and a feral gasp emitted from the bottom of his throat. I was going to kill it now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"kill it.\"\n\n\"Kill me.\" \n\n\"Candle\"\n\n\"KILL\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe words echoed on an asynchronous loop inside my mind.\n\nI fell down the steps as my unbraced momentum carried me forward, flailing as I fell to the unforgiving earth. I found myself on my feet before I even processed that I even fell. But then I was face to face with it, its breath was too hot, too sticky. The smell of rot and decay filled my nose. I recoiled in fear at the smell and close proximity. I backed up until I was pressed against the wall of my house. I lost my nerve. I wasn't strong enough. I wasn't capable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt then screamed and heaved and shook in front of me.. its milky eyes still looking beyond me.. hands outstretched. And with the scream, courage returned to me, rage returned to me. It was the same as it was all that time ago in the school. I was feeling something that I wasn't actually feeling. It was my feelings, but I wasn't the one feeling them. It's so hard to explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI embodied these feelings though, and let them wash over me, and consume me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"kill\" The word was on repeat in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sprung forwards and swung my ax with a primal scream, burying the blade deep in its side. The feeling of bone deflecting the axe upwards was a sensation I still haven't forgotten. Blood and other fluids spewed from the wound. It took a few sideways steps in retaliation against the momentum of my assault. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt stopped crying, shaking.. even breathing. Time froze as he finally looked at me. I was rooted in place by my fear. We stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. Our eyes locked. That foul breath returned with a vengeance. Nothing happened beyond that, we just stood there. I willed my bones to thaw. My mind, once racing in terror and fevered rage, was now feeling... pride? No.. it was something else, but a victorious emotion nonetheless, I think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't notice he had reached out and gently gripped my arm, only becoming aware of it myself once it started to speak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I never.. meant to.. scare you..\" he said in this torn-up voice, struggling between shallow breaths \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm sorry.. this has to.. happen to.. you..\" it said\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts eyes welled up in pain while it clutched at the axe in the new laceration with his ragged hand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Please... kill... me...\" He wheezed, the words forming inside of my head but also reaching my ears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took the ax with its other hand and brought the blade to its neck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Kill me... candle... kill. NOW!\" The final word sounded like an explosion in my head as it put its hand on my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything went black for a fractured moment once I swung my axe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly I felt like I was falling through space, a void. The air around me became cold as the wind whipped past me. I descended without limits, it was nauseating. I started shrieking in utter confusion and terror. Down and down, faster and faster I fell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Did I die?\", \"Is this death?\", \"I'm dead.\", and other thoughts of my probable end dominated my courage. I didn't want to die yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the distance, far below me, was steadily expanding light. Fresh tears streamed from my eyes, making it hard to tell how far away it was, how much longer I had until I would be halted by the ground. It was coming up fast though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slammed my eyes shut and screamed, this time in defiance to the face of my inevitable death. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to live. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to live. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI curled into the fetal position and braced every muscle in my body, anticipating my brutal ending. Seconds later, I collided with the floor with a soft and gentle thud, like I fell off a couch. A meek squeal departed with my pride in tow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI uncoiled my limbs and lay there for a time, paralyzed by the fresh confusion and exhaustion. Was that death? Was I still alive? I was aware at the least. I took note of what I felt under my hands and I noted that I was on a hardwood floor. I opened my eyes or tried to. If I did open them, it was too dark to see anything. Completely black. I rolled over to my back, extending my arms as far as I could. I didn't feel any walls. I then reached my unseen hands towards my face.  Am I blind? Do I have eyes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dirty, sweaty hands met my open eyes with more force than intended. It burned.. A lot. My eyes were definitely open. At least I still had eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI chuckled lightly to myself, tears still falling, and I let out a weak, triumphant sigh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess at this point, I fainted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI awoke sometime later to an unfamiliar hallway, but at least there was light this time. I glanced around from where I lay on the floor. I was in a hallway. Old, deformed dark wood floors stretched into the endless dark in either direction. A thick layer of dust rested upon the handles of 2 doors on either side of me. Each door was illuminated by its own candle, and small shadows danced in the wake of the curling white paint. Aged red and gold ornate walls framed the hall, and they too stretched uninterrupted, out of sight. The air was still, thin and cold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pushed myself to my feet, taking a reflexive breath as I did, but my lungs didn't work, I couldn't pull in the air. It was unnerving, but I was too shaken to be scared by something like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith an unexpected amount of acceptance, I thought to myself \"Maybe I really am dead, and maybe this is limbo or something.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow standing, I sauntered over to the door on my right, brushed off the collected dust, and tried turning the bronzed knob. It didn't budge in the slightest. I turned around and tried the other door, and the same thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've heard of death being like that, the dead person has to wonder about the realm until they can finally rest their soul. If there's nothing to be learned? Well, then it's purgatory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing well aware of the probable circumstance, I initiated my walk down the hall into the dark. Slowly, the light faded in the distance behind me. I kept roaming for hours, dragging my right hand along the wall as I went. I wandered without casualty into the endless darkness. I noticed I wasn't getting tired or hungry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must be dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this is all there is, I don't want it. Just nothingness? That's a reality the Gods abandoned long ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to jog in an attempt to keep my composure, the thought of turning around was tangible but not obeyed. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new light split the darkness from behind me. I was so startled that the sharp and icy pain of fearful surprise caught my chest. I tensed, flailed, and tripped over my own feet with a breathless yelp. Smooth as gravel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI rolled out of it with unexpected grace and I turned around, launching myself backward. I went careening toward my unexpected prize; like the light would disappear if I didn't get to it fast enough. Once I reached the light, I desperately grabbed at the handle of the nearest door to stop my momentum. The handle remained absolutely solid and didn't flex in the slightest as it stopped me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ignorance of my reality was breaking. I couldn't actually be dead, could I? I wasn't safe. I wasn't ok. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI seized the knob with both hands and gave it everything I had to open it. I rammed my shoulder into the door, pulled on it, hit it, kicked it, and pleaded with it. Nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fell back and collapsed against the door, kneeling and burying my face in my folded arms. The tears then came again because I didn't know what to do. I couldn't go anywhere. It was pointless to move on. I was stuck here. This was my punishment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI rolled over to my side, hugging my legs close to my chest and I simply.. just.. stopped trying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lay there curled in a ball for months or maybe it was years. I didn't move an inch according to the layer of dust that blanketed my body. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStagnant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was stagnant yet again. So what? I was done with this. I was done fighting for my right to live. I was done trying to escape my apparent destiny. I was so sick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself beginning to rot as I lay there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut some small voice spoke from deep within me. A voice that told me to keep going. Reasoning that said, \"Why? Well, why not?\". It nagged at me relentlessly. My will to stay still grew stale with time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, I caved and I began to stir. My bones creaked and cracked in response to the small, beckoned movement. My skin ripped and every muscle in me screamed a retort with every twitch, but I moved. I wanted something different because that couldn't be all it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took some time, but I found my way to a sitting position. I was freshly motivated to keep trying, but my body still held tight to my folly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMove.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, a new light ruptured the darkness, but it grew brighter and brighter. This was the brightest thing I'd ever seen. The endless walls were now fully clad with old white doors and their furiously burning candles. I shielded my eyes from the exposure and recoiled from the heat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlancing through my fingers, I saw something else I'd never seen before. The end of the hallway. Out was there. The continuation was there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fire was lit in my soul. I forced myself to stand, using the wall as a brace to accommodate my feeble legs. There was so much pain but I went from a shaky shuffle to a stiff speed walk. In hindsight, I'm sure this was a nightmarish visage. At that moment, however? At that moment I never wanted anything more than to reach the final door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran with everything I had, which wasn't much. I felt like I was baking alive as I proceeded. I also noticed each door had a number as I glanced at my surroundings, and they were going up.\n\n37, 39, 41, 43\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut again and ran as fast as I could. Blinding light tore through my eyelids with a spectacular white-out brightness. Searing pain gripped my every nerve. Maybe I should have at least checked how far away the end was because I hit the wall with a solid thump, breaking my nose and the ricochet threw me to the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery candle extinguished except the one for the door in front of me, #158. Endless darkness returned behind me so I focused on the door and that last lit candle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCandle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCandle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe word bounced around my mind with an unwavering significance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA familiar, strained voice pierced my mind. \"Kill Candle.\". His unforgettable ragged voice rang out from the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA low rumble began to form in the distance and grew steadily ever louder. Something was coming and I knew it to be nothingness. I felt it deep in my bones. A fallible end. A hard stop. A fear unlike any I'd ever known stabbed at my stomach. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI clasped the door nob, hoisted myself up, and twisted. Nothing, it didn't move in the slightest. The rumbling was closer. I tried turning the other way and it still didn't move. What little composure I had left was dwindling. I shook the door as the rumble began to reach a clamorous crescendo that I couldn't withstand. It was right behind me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPanic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI yanked frantically on the door, and a muted scream escaped my mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Kill. Candle.\" The words thundered over the approaching roar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImpending doom and action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was shaking the door with everything I had left when it finally dawned on me. Kill the candle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI smothered the flame with my bare hand and the door finally swung open but of its own accord. It was like I had defiled an airlock because I was suddenly and ruthlessly sucked into the chasm beyond the door, thrown into the void yet again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cacophony ceased behind me and I felt as though I was being slung across the universe at an impossible speed. I spun and flailed out of control. I was yet again no longer in control. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, as quickly as it began, it stopped. I was suddenly standing outside of my house and instantly observing a perplexing moment frozen in time. I saw myself, not the conscious me, but the other one that remained on Earth from the moment I was ejected into the hallway. I saw myself standing there with the axe in mid-swing, the blade was just beginning to connect with that thing's neck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took an unsure step forward and I was immediately flung back to that body. I melded with him and became reunited soul and bone. Time also resumed and I felt the axe carry out its intended purposes. A tear, in reality, came birthed from its arc and I was yet again quickly forced through the sieve of reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA jarring blackness blanketed the world and my axe hit something solid, metal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was dead quiet, but I smelled a familiar mustiness that reminded me of high school. Instantly my vision came rushing back, accompanied by intense vertigo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my mother's classroom. Bewildered, I looked to my left and saw her, and she saw me. I glanced over my shoulder, the entire class was staring at me in horror. I looked back to my hands in reaction to the sudden attention, the strangeness of the situation momentarily lost on me. I then noticed that the axe was buried in the gas line, and an audible hiss was apparent in the silence. I looked back to me and upon her desk sat a single burning candle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Candle the candle the candle candle candle candle The Candle-- I let go of my axe without allowing time to think, and sprinted towards the desk to put it out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I was too late. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe classroom ignited; It shook the entire foundation... I was blown into the wall and fell limply behind a desk. My body was blackened from the blast, and my bones were broken, but I held on to my consciousness. I don't know how but I was moving toward my mom before I knew it. My mom just laid there torn to pieces but still alive. I crawled the best I could to her side... my body in shock. I reached for her hand but instead found a severed limb. Reaching out her remaining arm, she found mine, gripping it the best she could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Mom!\" I sobbed \n\n\"Mom... I'm sorry!\" I cried over her; \"I'm so sorry, Mom!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was looking at me when she tried her best and spoke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I.. love you...\" She whispered, trying her best to smile. Then, her grip lost its force and her hand slipped away as gravity took a stronger hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI collapsed again, laying my head on her searing shoulder while flames lept from her burning clothes and scorched my wetted eyes. I couldn't have cared less then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt bile rising in my throat again once the whole picture was almost clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't kill the candle. I failed. I had another chance and I failed. Yet again.. for the 158th time.. I failed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't deserve to hold her. I needed to get away. I dragged myself to the corner of the room, behind a desk. My arms hung at my side, covered in my mom's blood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to touch anything... \n\nmy hands.. \n\nme. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI killed my mom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shook in the corner, and my otherworldly scream of pain and sorrow shattered the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone spoke from behind me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"HEY' he yelled, \"We have to get out! There's a gas leak!\" and he grabbed my hand. I turned towards him and realized he was me.. and I.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew I had become the nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand he ran.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been several days since then. I write this with what little autonomy I have left. I beg you to please search for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me what I must do.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel the grasp upon my self-control beginning to wither. This persistent and overwhelming compulsion to find \"me\", the me that isn't this wretch, is becoming all-consuming.. and I don't think I can hold myself back for another day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to break this cycle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe needs to reach the candle.",

He really thought he was funny, that bryon, but he was not.  If he wasn't one of the directors of land lads leases, i'd tell him that, I thought.  \n\n \"an anonymous source\" he said with finger quotes to the laughter of most of those feather-brained idiots in the room.  \"has brought to our attention a supposed 'murder' committed on the premises of the bush track we leased out to the public. \" he rolled his eyes and grinned.  \"I supposed we should take a look, eh?\" there was groans of annoyance from the board members. \" come on, don't be a bunch of whiners!\" he joked.  \"I'm sure it will be a good laugh\".  He turned on the video.  \n\n \n\na red-haired girl grinned at the camera.  \"hello, and welcome to my channel!\" she said, giving one of those fake little giggles.  I disliked her instantly.  \"I'm destiny, and this was my brother, william!\" she trilled.  The darker haired boy next to her sighed wearily.  \"please leave me out of this, Des.  He muttered.  \"anyway, she said, with a pointed looked at her brother, \"I went here today, cause, as you know, i'm very excited to learn about my family history! and guess what? her voice dropped to a theatrical whisper.  \" my ancestors house- was right over there!\" the camera swung over to the right, and i saw an old house with peeling, dark grey paint in the middle of the bush.  \"ready to go inside, kids?\" she gasped, stepping into the house, her brother reluctantly trudging along behind her.  \"I know I am!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nafter that, the video became terrifyingly bizarre.  \n\n strange noises seemed to have came from the walls in the background of destiny's  chatter, harmless objects seemed to have moved in the corners of the screen, edging closer and closer towards her and william.  Destiny didn't notice, but her brother looked uneasy, his eyes flitting towards the walls and backed to the door.  Then at some pointed, as though signaled by some unknown leader, objects began to move.  The movements were small at first, a rust-coated toaster falling towards them, bowling balls rolling slightly near them on the floor, but slowly increased until the footage cut to them being chased by a monstrous cupboard.  Destiny was screaming and crying, while william dragged her towards a room, which was empty expect for an old television.  The front door had disappeared behind them.  They dashed into the room and william slammed the door shut behind them.  “I think we’re safe,” he panted.The tv turned on.  And a blurry faced appeared in the middle of the static.  “I hate to disappoint you, but you’re not. ”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“w-what do you want?” destiny sobbed,  pouting in terror. \n\n “isn’t it obvious? I want to play a game,” the face said in a calm, clipped voiced.  “I’ve been bored for so long, but since you’ve seen my face now a quick game’s a good game!” it- no, he (I felt very certain that the creature was male) grinned.  “my turn!” with that, a filthy mannequin dropped down from the ceiling-\n\n and crushed william’s neck.  \n\n \n\ndestiny screamed in horror and tore past the mannequin out the broken window. \n\n the video then cut to destiny limping through the woods.  The mannequin tutted at her.  “you’re being a bad sport,” he said, sounding slightly irritated.  He continued to tore effortlessly through the wood towards her, his long legs eating up the distance between him and her in seconds.  In a last, desperate attempted for survival, destiny ducked behind a tree.  “this is it,” she said softly and sadly.  “I just wanted to say- thank you to all my subscribers for supporting me. ” the camera fell to the ground when the mannequin started to beat her.  I turned away then, unable to watch.  She screamed for a long time before it was quiet.  When i looked up, the video ended. \n\n \n\nI glanced around the room.  My co-worker's faces were as white as sheets.  Then the icy silence broke into a storm of sound.  I stared at the screen blankly, my heart pounding.  I someone said something about shutting the bush walked down but this idea was quickly dissimissed. Eventually ted noticed my shock.  He kindly (but firmly) told me to take the rest of the day off.  \n\nToo shell-shocked to argue, I walked out of the meeting room with my backpack in my hand.  But as i did, something at the back of the room caught my eyed.  A face appeared on the screen of the older tv.  And winked.",

        "text": "I love watching ghost hunting shows, to the point where I bought an EMF reader a while back for funsies. I’d been dying to go ghost hunting, and my perfect opportunity finally arrived!  \n\nMy friends and I caught wind of an abandoned children’s insane asylum about 2 hours away that wasn’t patrolled by police or security, so it was easy to sneak into. We planned our excursion for Friday night, and I could barely sleep all week I was so excited. The drive there was smooth and we got super stoned while jamming out to music to make the time pass. We pulled in a few minutes shy of midnight and ran excitedly to the building.  \n\nMy heart was pounding with anticipation as we entered. The building had 5 floors, and the bottom level looked like a frat house. Graffiti lined the walls and empty beer cans littered the floor. It was kind of lame, so we decided to head to the 4th floor. You see, the 5th floor of the asylum was where the most mentally ill children were kept, so we figured let’s just get closer to the good stuff.  \n\nIt’s dark. Much darker than the 1st floor. It feels colder too. We start slowly walking down the hallway and I think to turn my EMF reader on. It crackles and crackles but reads nothing. We’re peeking in rooms as we walk down a hallway. There’s old, dusty medical beds, forgotten medical equipment, random garbage. We come to what looks like used to be a dining area, and suddenly I hear a beep! I pull my reader out of my pocket, adjusting the volume when we hear a faint children’s giggle come through. We all froze, staring wide-eyed at each other and just as I looked down, a red kick ball came rolling slowly past us.  \n\nA couple of my friends started panicking, but I had to see the 5th floor. I urged them forward and it’s a decision I’ll regret forever. We make our way up and through the halls. These rooms are different. The medical beds have chain and leather restraints still attached. The air is thick, like it’s almost hard to breathe. We make our way to a corridor and find the old building’s elevator. One of the group, my best friend, walked over to it with me to check it out. The doors were missing, so we curiously looked inside the open elevator shaft and the elevator itself looked to be way down at the bottom level.  \n\nI started to feel dizzy, so I took a step back. A sudden cool breeze hit the back of my neck but after that, everything went black. I came to on the floor with my friend’s pale, horrified faces looking down at me. I broke out in a cold sweat and stared at them, confused. “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?” one of them shouted. I noticed that someone’s face was missing and looked towards the elevator shaft. Instantly, I realized what happened. I pushed him. I pushed my best friend down the elevator shaft. I felt the blood drain from my face and just as I felt like I was about to vomit, it all went black again….",

        "text": "I don't remember the exact moment it all started happening, but I remember the first time I noticed.\n\nI'm not a fan of the dark (sure, laugh all you want at the 25 year old man being afraid of the dark, but it is what it is) so I'm pretty much always home before sundown. I work the morning and/or day shift happily since I'm always in bed by 11:30 tops. I don't usually wake up during the night, but lately I had been getting up almost every night. Not a big deal, right? I'd just get a glass of water or something and fall back asleep.\n\nThen I heard it. I remember I didn't even think much of it, too. \n\nDogs.\n\nJust a bunch of dogs barking, it sounded like every dog in the neighborhood to be honest. It had to have been over 30, and it sounded like they were coming from every yard. \n\nThen, just as suddenly, they all stopped. One minute to the next, every dog stopped their incessant barking and howling and the entire neighborhood was silent again. I turned on the hall light and went to the living room to check on Pickles (named him after Pickle Rick lol) and he was curled up on the sofa. I didn't hear any barking inside my house, which is weird, right? What dog just doesn't join in on that kinda frenzy? \n\nI just went back to sleep and didn't think much of it.\n\nNot until the barking woke me up again, and again the next night, and again after that. \n\nI wasn't too angry about it, just confused. \n\nIt became a bit of a red flag that next Saturday. I took Pickles with me on a jog after work around the neighborhood and ran into Brock, the guy who lives in the house behind me. \n\n\"Hey, man, hey Pickles,\" he grinned down at my dog. He liked corgis and sometimes let Pickles into his yard to play with his two. \n\n\"What's up, Brock,\" I said, motioning that it was okay for him to give Pickles a little attention. \n\n\"Nothing much, thankfully. Almost done fixing up the room for the twins.\"\n\n\"Nice, nice. Hopefully your granddaughters don't get spooked with all the barking lately,\" I commented.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know, all the barking at night. Your dogs definitely aren't innocent, but it's no biggie,\" I joked.\n\n\"My dogs don't bark at night. They sleep in the bedroom with me and Jane.  We've never had a barking problem.\" His lips were a firm line, obviously not appreciating my \"accusations\" or whatever.\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" I raised my hands in surrender. \"Maybe your boys are innocent, but they must be some of the only ones. The barking's woken me up for like a week already.\"\n\nBrock gave me a once over, his eyes boring into me with that kind of intensity only veterans can manage. You know, that dead-eyed look where it feels like they're stripping you and checking for bombs.\n\n\"I haven't heard any barking, son. You take care,\" he muttered, continuing his walk and brushing past me.\n\nThere's no way a dude with his history wouldn't be a light sleeper, so if he hadn't been woken up, how was I? I slept through a twister back when I lived down in Omaha. He could have been messing with me, he's a weird guy like that. Still, it left me unnerved.\n\nI didn't work the next day so I decided to stay up late for a little WWE marathon. \n\nI stayed on the sofa, Pickles nuzzled in my lap and a cold one in hand. As the sun kept dipping closer and closer to the horizon, I turned on the lamp on the end table. The warm, yellow glow was good enough to keep the room from being too dark.\n\nI was taking turns scrolling on my phone and watching takedowns on my TV when the barking started again. God, it was even louder than it had been last night, and I rolled my shoulders in discomfort. \n\nI peered down at my phone and noted the time.\n\n2:37am.\n\nBy 2:38, the barking stopped. Pickles hadn't even moved off my lap, much less howled along. \n\n\"How the fuck did you not hear that,\" I murmured, giving his head a little pat. He licked my hand.\n\nI set him down on the cushion beside me and went to turn on the room light. I pushed the blinds apart to sneak a look outside, maybe see some dogs running around.\n\nNothing. The neighborhood was empty, not a living soul in sight. \n\nWeird. \n\nI went to sleep a little while later.\n\nThis cycle of waking up at night kept dragging on, and each time I found it harder and harder to fall back asleep. It just felt... off. Like, all of it was extra dodgy, because I tried to casually mention the loud ass barking to a few more neighbors and each time, no one even knew what I was talking about. I obviously couldn't ask him, but I feel even Pickles would have looked at me like I had three heads if I did.\n\nI started checking my phone every time that godforsaken barking woke me up, and each time it began at 2:37 in the morning and stopped at the exact second the clock hit 2:38. \n\nThe next day I had off work, I decided I'd wait at my window to see if any dogs come out. I figured they had to be nearby since the racket was just so close and loud. \n\nAt 2:36, I muted my TV and held the blinds open again. The minute hand chugged on and like clockwork, the first dog began howling. With a sound that intense, you'd think it was sitting in my front yard, but no. Just like the last time I had checked, the neighborhood was deserted, but the noise was getting ridiculous. The gruff barking and the piercing howls made my skin prickle. If I were in a movie, the hair would stand on the back of my neck or something.\n\n2:38 and it all came to a halt.\n\nI sighed and went to grab the melatonin I had bought and headed for bed. It took what felt like two hours to get to sleep.\n\nI tried this again, but using my phone to record and send to my group chat (just so I didn't feel crazy anymore). I started recording at 2:37, right after the first dog went off, and this is when the second (third?) red flag hit me. The streetlight flickered abruptly and died, making my view outside pitch black. I grimaced, but stayed at the window. As soon as I stopped recording, my phone flashed white and then turned off. It took like 10 minutes to get it on again and when I did, the video was just gone. Not in my gallery, not in the trash, nowhere. It was like the video never existed.\n\nI spent the next night at my friend Patrick's house. I think at this point it was muscle memory or instinct or something, because I jerked awake at 2:37 anyway. I heard a single dog howl and that was it, but nothing as close or loud like it was at my house. I finally got a real good sleep for the first time in half a month and I really didn't wanna leave, but I had to go back for Pickles. Plus I still had a mortgage, so.\n\nLike you'd all expect, it happened again the very next night, 2:37 on the dot.\n\nI felt like I was alone in hell, no one else in my stupid neighborhood was hearing this, I couldn't catch it on camera, and the streetlight hadn't been fixed so I wasn't gonna leave the house and check it out. \n\nShit really hit the fan when I heard a bang at my door. It sounded like someone, or something, rammed itself against the door. Just once, but that alone kept me up the rest of the night. \n\nThe next night, amidst the screeching and howling and barking and awfulness of it all, I heard scratches, both at my front and back door. Like the dogs were trying to get in. I didn't sleep that night either. \n\nMy eyes were always bloodshot, the bags under them such a deep brown that they made my eyes look even more sunken in. I'd never had such dark bags, it looked like my face got all hyperpigmented. I couldn't be assed to keep up with taking care of myself because I always felt exhausted. I got written up at work for sleeping on the job, but I could only find solace in quick naps during the day.  \n\nI felt the drag taking its toll over me so quickly. Even my bones felt sore and tired, but the closer to 2:37am, it was like someone shot me up with straight caffeine. \n\nIt just kept getting louder and louder and fucking louder. That one minute, that one fucking minute, just made every day feel like torture. My hair started falling out. I remember I couldn't even bring myself to feel sad when I saw the clump of black curls piled up on the shower drain. I lost my appetite and now my clothes hang off my body unattractively. \n\nI couldn't bring myself to *care.* \n\nThe only thing on my mind, twenty-four hours a day, was that one minute where piercing dog barking and howls would flood my ears, now accompanied with the sounds of dogs whining and trying to force their way into my house. \n\nTwo nights ago was the worst one. I kept thinking it couldn't get worse, and yet it did, every damn night.\n\n2:37. \n\nIt sounded like they were in my walls. *Inside* my house. I laid there, staring at my ceiling with my eyes glazed over. The dim brightness from my wall plug-in light kept me from being engulfed in the darkness, but it almost didn't matter. The scratching was relentless, it sounded like sharp claws were close to breaking open the drywall right behind me. My bed shook a bit, like the wall was pushing against the frame, and I choked out a sob. \n\nThen my back door swung open, I could hear the handle smack right into the wall with a cracking sound. God, the noise... It sounded like the dogs were right in my ear, so loud I couldn't even hear the different barks and howls, like it was all just one buzzing sound bouncing around in my skull. \n\nSomehow, I heard nails (claws) scraping against my floor, and I squeezed my eyes shut. They got in. It had to be at least 10 different dogs running around in my house, towards my bedroom.\n\n\"Get out,\" I gasped, eyes still firmly shut. \"Get out, get out, get out of my fucking house, *get out of my fucking house*!\" I was screaming at the top of my lungs, the words stung my throat like bile from how much force I put into them.\n\n2:38. \n\nSilence.\n\nPickles. \n\nI bolted out of bed, stumbling over the blankets until I managed to scramble into the living room. \n\nHe was awake and okay, but he looked at me with a little tilt in his head, like he was confused why I was yelling and running to him. I took sharp, shaky breaths until it didn't hurt to inhale anymore. I turned towards the backdoor and then I had to throw up.\n\nIt was open. The handle had broken into the wall, leaving a cracked hole where it smashed into it. There were a few deep scratches, claw marks, on my floor and some dirt. I kept Pickles' claws trimmed, so it wasn't my dog for sure. I scooped him into my arms and held him tight to my chest, the tremors running through me feeling like a seizure. I slowly made my way to the door and closed it. I tried to lock it, but the handle was broken. I pushed a chair in front of it and went to my room, Pickles still in my arms.\n\nI locked my bedroom door and put him on the bed. I wasn't gonna be able to sleep, but he still could. \n\nYesterday, I called a locksmith to replace the handle and I pointedly ignored the claw marks, especially  the four thin lines on the outside of my bedroom door. I also ignored the warped look in my walls, like something was close to ripping them apart. \n\nLast night, I got the gun out of my safe and put it on the pillow beside me. \n\nI didn't even bother to sleep, I just spent the entire night with my knees up to my chest, eyes open and staring at nothing. I could hear Pickles snoring softly at the foot of my bed. My mom always told me it was dirty to have a dog in your bed, especially one that sheds like he does, but I didn't care anymore. He needed to be with me. \n\n2:36.\n\nI let out a shaky breath, my mind racing. I'd have to shoot a dog. I've never even used a gun on anything but bottles in the backyard at my brother's house. I'd probably have to shoot more than one.  Fuck, there'd be blood in my bedroom. Pickles gonna freak out, he's never even heard a gunshot. \n\n2:37.\n\nA lone howl sounded outside my window and I gripped the gun tightly, hot tears slipping from my eyes. The barking was insufferable, right there in my ears. There was growling, a rabid and hungry noise that I could feel right behind me. The scratching started again, I could hear them in the walls, seconds from breaking out. The door blew open too, the hinges popping off easily. The footsteps were heavy and fast, and an innumerable amount of claws were at my bedroom door. I could hear the thin wood waning under their weight.\n\nThe barking was in my head, I could feel slobbering and saliva hitting the sides of my face and I gasped out a sharp cry. \n\nMy night light went out. \n\nI was trapped in the blackness, and I felt my stomach drop. I was confined, the space around me closing in, keeping me trapped in a tightening space where I was lost. \n\n I couldn't even hear the dogs anymore, it was a steady ring in my ears, so painful it felt like blood was going to start trickling out any second. I grabbed my phone off my lap and turned the flashlight on.\n\nThe dog in front of me was a monster.\n\nIt stood over my legs, with long, black, matted fur and a long, thin snout. It was big enough it could have been a wolf, but it was unmistakably a dog. Its ears were pointed, the snarl on its face inches from mine. I felt a wet drop of its drool land on my skin. The expression on its face was enough to kill, I could feel my entire body shaking as I stared into its red eyes.\n\nThe eyes are burned into the back of my brain, red eyes brighter than flames, but they flickered the same way. The smell of it was foul, so bad I could feel my insides churning. It stank like a corpse, like a dead animal left to rot in the summer sun. \n\nIt barked, barked right in my face, sending an assault of thick and sticky drool all over my face and the simmering heat of its breath singed my nose. The creak of the springs in my mattress as it leaned forward, closer, was gut wrenching. \n\nIt barked again, and the sheer power in its bark made my ears ring. I felt dizzy just listening to the sound, an earsplitting burst that was encouraged by the flurry of other dogs still howling away. \n\nIt opened its snout wider, sharp white teeth glistening in the light of my phone. I was done for. I knew this beast of a dog was going to snap my neck in two and-\n\n2:38.\n\nMy flashlight went out. The smell, the sound, the weight of it over me was gone. I gasped in short, painful breaths, a deep stitch forming in my side. I was sweating badly, my sheets and clothes practically glued to my skin. \n\nI turned on my flashlight again and pried my fingers off the gun. I was so afraid I didn't even think to use it. I forgot it, honestly. \n\nI shined the light in my room, noting the chips in my walls, the holes, the scratches on the floor and on my door, which hung open ominously. I turned the light towards the foot of my bed.\n\n\"Pickles,\" I croaked, nudging him with a toe. He didn't move. \"Pickles.\"\n\nI fell getting out of bed, my legs about as solid as jello. I smacked my wall until I hit the light switch and trembled the way over to my dog.\n\n\"Pickles,\" I whispered, touching his soft fur with delicate hands. I picked him up and felt every nerve in my body scream in pain when his neck rolled loosely. Deep, bloody teeth holes all over it. \n\nI stumbled over my own feet and promptly threw up, the burn in my throat barely rivaling the heat from my tears.\n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do now. Pickles is gone. I buried him in the backyard this afternoon and now I'm just so fucking empty. I should have done something different, but what? What the hell can I even do. My best friend is gone. I know what got him. And I know it's coming back tonight.",

        "text": " I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place sure to never get any business. No human business, that is. Laura isn't a fly anymore, but we didn't exactly make progress. Jo came into the shop to see me (I don't know if she still wants to eat me though). In short, a lot of weird stuff happens. If you want to get caught up, or start at the beginning, then go ahead and check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) out.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nI still have the doll. In fact, as I am writing this, it is sitting next to my computer. Oh all the wishes it could grant me, all at a price that I wouldn't have to pay. Selene knows about it now, but just her. She advised me to keep it secret as there are many out there that might want to take it from me. That might seem like an easy solution, but how can I let it go on good conscience? Giving it to someone else would be no different than making a wish myself.\n\n\"Make a color that no one has ever seen.\" I mumbled as the burning sensation became too much to bear. That wish kept it busy for a while.\n\nIf you are wondering why I still have the doll, seeing as I said the Eye of Gold destroyed it, then make sure you are[ caught up.](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/108jn6s/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) If you are upset at how long it has been since an update, then I apologize. I am pretty shaken by the entire thing, as I think it is fair. We haven't seen John since he took Dan's place (it seems that *typing* John won't summon him). The store is fixed and back to normal, albeit a bit strange since Richard is working in the kitchen.\n\nOh yeah. Dan left. It only took a few days before he was gone, off to find the wife that didn't remember him. He hadn't forgotten her, however. Hadn't forgotten the years they spent together, nor the wedding that those years had led to. I really wish him luck, but I know what John said. Payton had no idea Dan existed and, if it were so easy to make her remember, I doubt John's words would have been so dire in his recounting. Dan was entirely unhelpful and unwilling to discuss the time he spent with Rykar. I tried getting answers out of him regarding Amber and her candles, but he was a closed case.\n\nSpeaking of; I don't appreciate Amber selling candles inside. Most of the time she is at her table next to the drive thru, not a bother to us inside. But occasionally she comes in to check on her little stand near the front door. I get a wink, maybe she'll come over for a flirty chat. I'm sure it is all to get me to buy a candle, but it all seems so genuine. She really does seem sweet. That is good for business, I guess.\n\nAnyway, we saved Em. She is awake now and even working. So we saved Em, lost John, and also lost Dan again. Richard wanted to be pissed, but when he heard that Selene was all part of the plan, he got quiet and kept his frustrations to himself. That was interesting, considering he was the owner. Perhaps he had so much trust invested in Selene that none of it mattered, or he didn't have the energy to deal with his store's manager. Either way, we were spared his wrath for the moment.\n\n\"I read your story.\" I sat down with Selene. She had begun to hang out in the lobby near her office door, keeping it open just in case the light turned off.\n\nShe smiled, but her face reddened. \"Oh yeah? Aren't I a great writer?\"\n\n\"Did all of that actually happen?\"\n\nSelene shrugged. \"Mostly. Maybe I embellished a little.\"\n\nShe was in too good a mood for me to spoil. I wanted to know about the hand thing, the deal she had made with Amber. It was identical to the one I struck with Rykar, flaming hand and all. Were they the same race? If that was the case, why wasn't she evil like Rykar? And, for that matter, was Rykar evil? Obviously he must be, considering he took both Dan and now John as slaves. I don't know and I didn't think it right to ruin a good day with hard questions.\n\n\"It was good.\" I honestly thought it was. \"You almost got killed.\"\n\n\"Eh, I was fine.\"\n\nThat was true. \"Seems like we both had a bit of recovery.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nAnd that was the extent of our conversation. The remainder of my break was spent in an awkward limbo, one in which we both mentioned something inconsequential and nodded about it. I found myself back on my shift, failing at both small talk and interrogation. I also screwed up, by the way. As you will remember, I mentioned 'my deal with Rykar' when I was recounting how we saved Em. Well, Selene read that. She hasn't pressed as hard as I would have expected, but she is very cautious. Selene only asked me once and I said I couldn't tell her. Multiple of you have said I should come clean, but coming clean won't help me break the deal; it will only make her trust me less and currently I am low on friends.\n\nThat bitch Heartmin came in again. This time we made her order without the two minute time frame, thank god. After she left, however, came the reason for this update.\n\n\"I can't see anything outside.\" Em said as she refilled our water dispenser by the door. The front of the store was a massive window and she was right, I couldn't see anything at all. Sure, it was night, but the light in the store and parking lot let us see what we needed to.\n\n\"Huh.\"\n\nBarrow went to the drive thru window. \"Same here. Selene?\" He went around the counter and into the lobby.\n\n\"Yeah?\" She didn't sound interested, as usual.\n\n\"It is pitch black outside.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" We'd interrupted something, apparently. \"It is night. That isn't new.\"\n\nBarrow, unaffected by her irritation, gestured at the glass wall across the lobby. \"No, I mean we can't see anything at all.\"\n\nFinally, she looked towards the window. \"Well that isn't right.\" Selene stood from her seat and approached the barrier that kept them from the dark. \"I've never seen this before. Unless...\" Moving to the other lobby (yes, there are two separated by three doorless frames) she grabbed the front door. \"Stay back, please.\"\n\nWhen we stepped away, she cracked the door open and looked down. \"Oh...\" She mumbled, then let the door shut gently. \"So, this isn't good.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Well, first of all, don't open any doors to the outside. Even the drive thru.\"\n\n\"What about customers?\"\n\nShe swallowed. \"We don't serve anything here.\" We waited for her to elaborate. \"And our main customer base won't find the cafe. Maybe? I don't know how this works exactly.\"\n\n\"Where are we, Selene?\" Evangel, who worked in the kitchen that day instead of Richard, was sure to stay near the kitchen and not take any risks.\n\n\"Var'lovya.\" I've never heard of that, but Selene explained its meaning. \"*Var* means 'eternity,' or for something to happen forever. *Lov* means 'aimless path.' This is the endless path. This is the void.\"\n\nA starless sky, like an overcast night. It was somehow deeper than that, as if my eyes could perceive an endless space. I could see nothing for all of eternity, a depth that consumed my mind the longer I stared into the abyss. Endless, yet there was nothing to see. Without bounds, but not one thing existed there with us.\n\nI still think about it, mostly at night when my eyes are shut. There is a darkness that is so great that your mind starts to place things within it so as to make up for its incapability to process it. I saw a face floating there in the depths, one that materialized into someone I once knew. Not them, I could not look upon them. But once my mind knew that, it was not able to bring forth a different image. The haunting visage of a woman with black hair came and went so rapidly that I could not appreciate her face, was fainter than even my memory of her.\n\nThen Em grabbed the door.\n\n\"Hey, don't go outside!\"\n\nShe pointed towards the void. \"My father...\"\n\n\"He isn't there.\"\n\n\"But...\" Her eyes were locked in the darkness. \"I can see him.\"\n\nSlowly Selene removed Em's hand from the door. \"He isn't there. No one is. *Nothing* is.\" She put herself in front of the door, barring our way out. \"There is nothing out there for any of us. This is our anchor, this store is our only way home. We are sailing through the abyss and *will* land. If anyone leaves, there will be no way home.\"\n\n\"How did we get here?\" Evangel did not come any closer. \"This isn't in the rules, but you know about it. Why isn't it in the rules?\"\n\n\"Because I've been here before. Not while working here as Richard's manager. We *shouldn't* be here, I don't even know how this is possible. What I *do* know is that we can get home if we just stay here. It might take time, but it will pass.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Barrow asked.\n\n\"Experience.\"\n\n\"Hey, what is this about?\" Another voice asked.\n\nRight, we had customers in the sitting lobby. \"Just a spill, don't worry! Go enjoy your meal!\" Selene tried.\n\nBefore the lights went out, I counted three cars aside from the employee's. That would be trouble.\n\n\"A spill?\" The well-dressed man challenged. He pointed outside. \"That does *not* look like a spill. What, did you spill ink all over the store?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" That wasn't going to work, so Selene sighed. \"There is an issue with the lights and it isn't safe outside. Please just stay here and stay calm.\"\n\n\"So you're locking us in?!\"\n\nA younger man, possibly a student of some kind, came in response to the commotion. \"We are locked in?!\"\n\n\"You know what? You are welcome to leave if you like!\" She snapped. \"Fall into an endless abyss for all I care! But don't let anything in!\" Selene crossed her arms and stepped aside. \"But not my employees. No, you all stay back!\"\n\n\"What is all this about?\" A young woman also joined the fray. \"Did you say we weren't allowed to leave? Also, why is it so dark? I can't see my car!\"\n\nAnd finally the last of the customers stepped out of the bathroom. An elderly man with a slow way about him. He was very tall, looming over any of the rest of us. Grandfatherly, I'd say; he made me feel somewhat comfortable just by being around.\n\n\"What's this then?\" He mumbled. \"Pretty dark outside, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You're all human?\"\n\n\"What do you mean *human*?!\" The business man growled, moving towards the door. \"You're all morons! I was an idiot to even come he-\" He opened the door.\n\nIf it weren't for his grip on the door, he would have tumbled into nothing forever. After a cry and a struggle with the hanging door, he managed to get himself inside with our aid. No one tried to open the door after that.\n\n\"What...\" He trailed off. \"Where... what is this?\"\n\n\"Again, are you all human?\" Selene asked.\n\n\"Y-yeah.\" The young man answered. The others gave nervous nods.\n\n\"That is unusual.\" She was right. Normal people were somewhat uncommon at the Drowsy Spectre. Four of them as our *only* customers were even stranger. But it would make the night easier, so I wasn't complaining.\n\nSelene lifted her head. \"We aren't connected to any actual power. The fact that we have any light at all is-\"\n\nEverything went dark. Thanks Selene.\n\nThump. What was that?\n\nSeconds of darkness followed before a flashlight clicked to life in Barrow's hands. \"Glad I have this.\"\n\n\"I have my phone.\" The young lady, as promised, flooded the area with her phone's flashlight. \"My battery isn't full, though.\"\n\n\"Same.\" The young man pulled his out. \"I'll save it.\"\n\n\"I'll be saving my battery, thanks!\" The well-dressed man backed towards the sitting lobby. \"And I suggest we all keep away from each other.\"\n\nThere was someone missing. \"Where is the old guy?\" Yeah, that was a rude way of putting it, but I was on edge.\n\nBarrow's flashlight swept the floor until it found something wet. That wet trail led the beam towards the kitchen, where the elderly man lay in a dark pool. Yeah, he was most certainly dead and that pool was most certainly his own blood.\n\nSelene grabbed Barrow's arm. \"Make sure *she* doesn't go out the door!\"\n\n\"He's dead!\" The young man cried out, stating the obvious.\n\nAnd, just to be certain, Evangel checked. \"Yeah. No pulse.\" She lifted her head as Selene approached. \"I didn't hear anything... why didn't we hear anything?\"\n\n\"I heard a thud.\" That was all I could offer.\n\n\"Who cares what you heard!\" The business man growled. \"A man is dead! Someone murdered him and we are all trapped in here with whoever did it!\"\n\nIt looked like I got myself into a classic murder mystery. Well, not very classic seeing as I was floating in a void. You know, that should scare me, shouldn't it? Now that I think about it, I wasn't as frightened of the spider lady either. When you see impossible things every day, I guess you become more intrigued than frightened. I don't know if that is a good thing. Certainly it can't be, seeing as I was curious rather than shocked when we found the dead elder on our cafe floor.\n\n\"It could be any of us.\" Evangel took a step back. \"Anyone could have done it!\"\n\nThe young man screamed. Barrow's flashlight found that he was fine and well. \"Sorry... sorry I am just a bit on edge right now, okay?\" He'd backed into a chair.\n\nSelene stood up from the body and turned off her phone flashlight. \"His eyes are gone.\" Her face remained cast-down. \"Dammit... dammit! How is this possible?!\"\n\n\"What aren't you telling us, Selene?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" She waved me off. Rude. \"But Evangel is right. He didn't trip, lose his eyes, and slit his own throat. Something did so rapidly when the dark came.\" Barrow still barred the door. \"Hook, don't turn off that flashlight. When the lights go, the void comes in.\"\n\n\"Didn't plan on it.\"\n\n\"First order of business is to get everyone in one place. Done. Next, what are your names?\"\n\n\"Rick.\" The business man replied. \"And I am quite done with all of this. What sort of drugs did you slip in me, huh?!\"\n\n\"Believe me, no one would want to drug you.\" She ignored his heated face and addressed the screamer. \"And you?\"\n\n\"Jack.\" The sudden attention drove him a step back, as if the question were a test he might fail.\n\nThen there was the last one, which did not wait to be called on. \"Maggie. Is this some kind of fucked up dream?\" She covered her mouth. \"Sorry, that just came out. Are y'all-\"\n\nSelene didn't care. \"You're fine. And all of you claim to be human?\"\n\n\"Claim to be?\" Rick challenged. \"How is that a claim? It is a fact.\"\n\n\"Not here it isn't.\"\n\n\"Well how do I fucking prove it to you, huh?\"\n\nSelene sighed. \"That is the question.\" Then, she placed the burden on me. On me! \"What do you think?\"\n\nI don't know anything! My only response was a shrug and a mumble. Only, I did have an emergency out. The doll in my jacket. I felt for it, but it was not there. \"Uh, there is a problem.\" I whispered to Selene.\n\nWith everyone staring, she leaned in. \"*What?*\" She was a bit harsh.\n\n\"The doll is gone.\"\n\n\"Do you need the doll to wish?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\n\"Something you'd like to share with the rest of us?\" Maggie pryed. \"Something we should know?\"\n\nEm joined Selene and I. \"I'm better now.\" She lifted her arms. \"Look, I am getting goosebumps. Literally. Look at my arms.\"\n\nAs promised, her hair was on end. \"Well you did almost walk into the void.\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Just thinking about it. See!\" Again, her arms had not changed. \"It is weird out there.\" She crossed her arms. \"Who's that?\"\n\nWas she gone, mentally, the entire time? \"You missed the dead guy?\" Selene asked, confused.\n\nBarrow stepped away from the door, bringing his flooding flashlight closer. \"You feeling okay, Em?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She crossed her arms. \"I'm just a bit confused is all.\"\n\n\"What do we do?\" He addressed Selene. \"You said we'd make it back if we waited?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Selene scratched her arm as she did when she was nervous. \"But how long will that take? This place doesn't like time.\"\n\n\"Doesn't *like* it?\" Rick interjected again. \"Make some sense! You still haven't told any of us why you'd ask if we were human!\"\n\nSelene snapped. \"Because not everyone here is, you dumbass! Shut up and let us think! We are trying to get you home without losing your damn eyes!\"\n\nClearly unaccustomed to being addressed in such a way, Rick was forced to back down slightly. Though I could see clearly on his face that he'd have more to say soon. My phone was at sixty percent, so I turned on the flashlight. I didn't want to rely on Barrow for my life, not with his inability to feel anything. Truth be told, I thought that would go away when I took the doll but he hadn't shown any signs that it had. Then again, perhaps it would just take time for him to adjust. I don't know; maybe I will bring it up with him.\n\n\"Are you human?\" Maggie asked.\n\nThat was a question Selene hesitated to answer. \"I didn't kill the old man, if that is what you are thinking.\"\n\n\"Who did?\" Jack stood away from the rest of the group, but he had his own flashlight on. He was listening. \"How do we find out?\"\n\n\"Who is packing?\" Barrow asked. They all glanced at each other, clearly asnwering his question. \"Then I am the only one.\" He revealed a weapon holstered at his belt. \"If this thing isn't human, this might not work on it. But it will work on the rest of you.\" The lack of emotion in his tone was intimidating, but I did not fear Barrow. They probably did.\n\nBut Rick found his voice. \"I don't feel comfortable that a stranger has the only gun when there has been a murder!\"\n\n\"So what, you think you should have it? None of us know you.\"\n\n\"I know how to shoot!\"\n\n\"Yeah, shoot us.\" Selene countered. \"That's probably what you want to do, huh?\"\n\nToo many eyes on him, Rick became nervous. Nervous meant more anger. \"Back off! I didn't move! I was in the same spot when that fella turned on his flashlight. Besides, how would a gun help me take out someone's eyes?!\" He lifted his fingers. \"No blood, either!\"\n\nEveryone else raised their hands, including me. Clean fingers. No one clawed out the old man's eyes and there was no way to clean up that fast.\n\n\"How do we know it was someone here? Selene said that the void could come in if the lights were off. Maybe something snuck in from out there?\"\n\nSelene considered my suggestion. \"It would still be here if that were the case. But...\" She moved to the other lobby. \"But the door is open.\"\n\nThe second lobby, meant for dining in, had a door of its own. Usually it was locked, but we had to bring some new tables and such after the disaster a few weeks back. Turns out we forgot to lock it back. And it was open. It doesn't close right, you see, so you have to give it a good pull. A customer must have come in through it and not realized it didn't close easily.\n\nSo it was left open for anything outside to enter.\n\n\"Well that puts us back to square one.\" Selene crossed her arms. \"If something came from the void, it has no power in the light. It is, effectively, one of us. But that flashlight might fail before we get home. Our phones too.\"\n\n\"We should pool them all together.\" Maggie suggested. \"So we can ration them. So no one wastes battery on themselves. Rick here has been trying to call people this whole time.\"\n\nIt was true, Rick had been dialing and texting ever since Selene shut him down. \"My phone, young lady. Mind your own business.\"\n\n\"This *is* our business!\" She explained. \"Not dying!\"\n\nWhile they fought, Selene joined in, Em grabbed my arm and pulled me behind the counter. \"I found your reddit thingy.\"\n\nThat wasn't good, but it was only a matter of time. \"And?\"\n\n\"You really remember everything we say?\"\n\nI was pretty good at that. \"Apparently.\"\n\n\"I read about the doll.\" She started, then lowered her voice. \"And about the deal.\"\n\nThat was *very* not good. I shouldn't have written about that. In fact, I might have to edit it out. \"Sshh!\" Em was already quiet, but who knows what magic ears Selene had! \"You can't tell here! I have to find a way to break it first!\"\n\n\"Obviously.\" She crossed her arms. \"Look, mister. I want to be your friend, okay? I know I screwed up but you have to understand that it was my father. I'm not trying to make excuses but I have nothing without him. So... so this is my offer. I'll keep your secret, and we are friends.\"\n\nI already forgave her *and* saved her life. But I liked Em. She had a way of lightening a dark mood, even if it was by her own confusion. \"Don't tell anyone.\" But could she be trusted with such a task? Also, what if Barrow read it too? \"About any of it. Not even the story.\"\n\n\"Dealio.\" She held out her hand. \"Shake?\"\n\nI stared at that hand. Something made me hesitate. I saw myself looking at that mirror, at the goat-headed man within. Hand outstretched, ocre fire engulfing. What was a deal to a pixie, and what sort of binding was I making? I had only to be her friend, and she mine. She had to keep my secret. What was one more bargain?\n\nSo we shook on it.\n\n\"Can you wish us out, though?\"\n\nThat's right. She knew I still had the doll. \"Did you tell Barrow?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No sir, mister. It is a secret now.\"\n\nEm was a bit too loud, but then Evangel approached. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Wait for Selene to make a decision.\" Em answered. \"As always. She said she knows about this place and all that.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nWith no further progress being made, we found ourselves huddled into our own respective groups. Well, some were loners. Selene and I sat in one corner, Barrow and Em nearby. The customers remained in the light of Barrow's strong flashlight, Evangel sat as far as she could from the front door. Selene and I were far too close to the window, she needed to see if anything came from the deep. I was torn. I feel most safe next to the person with strange magic powers, but also the least safe with only a glass barrier protecting me from infinite nothing.\n\nThere is a certain dread you get when looking up into space when there are no stars. When the street lights are too bright, the city drowns out the night sky. It is only black, endless and empty. Some fear tight spaces, but I cannot stand the thought of an endless expanse. It drew my eyes like the depths of the ocean, full of a terrible mystery that made my body ready to scramble away. I was far too alert, fully aware of every beat of my heart, of every second and how many there would be if I were to swim in the black.\n\nEventually I could not bear to look at it, nor even glance into the depths. I stared into the shop, whose corners were barely lit by Barrow's powerful light. I couldn't fall asleep with a murderer on the loose and there was no sign of who (or what) had killed the old man. Despite the danger, though, my eyelids were getting heavy. I felt safe with Selene, safe enough to close them even though I knew it wasn't wise.\n\n*Knock knock*\n\nMy eyes shot open. I knew I hadn't been asleep long, I'd only just shut my eyes. Had it been part of a dream? No, I hadn't been asleep long enough to have one.\n\n*Knock knock*\n\nAgainst my head I felt the vibrations, knuckles on glass. There was a face there, I could feel it. Something stared with such an emptiness; no malice, no anger, not even curiosity. There was just a presence that knocked, one that was simply watching.\n\nIt wanted only to be witnessed.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\nI saw Maggie across the room, she was looking in my direction. Past me. Finally, she made eye contact and shook her head. She had no color, so much so that I could tell in the white light Barrow provided. Her eyes were nearly out of their sockets with terror. \"Don't\" she mouthed and shook her head once more.\n\n\"Hey.\" Came a whisper from behind, from through the glass. So tender, so close. \"Hey, are you awake?\"\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n\"Knock once for yessss.\" A little thump as something pressed itself against the window wall. \"You have the sweet thing that make’st real. Is not my face pleasing? Will thy see it?\"\n\nThe voice was so thick, so wet, so full of the desire to simply be seen or heard. Again, Maggie shook her head, placing a finger to her mouth.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n\"On four a deal we shall strike. You like deals, I know. Four knocks, and I shall tell you who bled the man. Four knocksss.\" It licked the window slowly. \"Like honey is the deal we shall strike. Like a gentle kiss, I shall tell you, and you shall look upon me. Four knocks, and gaze sweetly upon me.\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nShould I look? Maggie was shaking her head no rapidly, whispering to look away. The others seemed to be sleeping too, no one was keeping watch.\n\n*Knock*\n\nWhat was one more deal? At this point I'd signed away pretty much all of my freedom. All the thing was asking for was to be seen, why was that a bad thing? Maggie was sweating, raising her voice from a horse whisper. \"Don't look!\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nSo close, the fourth knock. I would look, I decided. Surely I had seen worse at the shop and out in the woods. Even if I hadn't, every record was meant to be broken, right? Maggie rose to her feet, waving her arms, but she did not want to wake the others. \"Don't look!\" She risked it, then took a step forward. \"DON'T LOOK!\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nMy body tried to hold me in place, but I forced it to move. I couldn't breathe, not knowing that something terrible was waiting for me. We had to know, though, if we wanted to survive. Why did I move so slowly? Because I suddenly didn't want to look. After all I had seen, I became afraid. Goosebumps that would make Em proud sprouted across my arms and every hair reached to escape the face behind the glass. No, my body didn't want it and neither did I.\n\nBut I turned anyway.\n\n\"STOP!\"\n\nMaggie's shout woke up Barrow, and failed to leap to his feet. He kicked the flashlight and the beam vanished into his jacket, which sat by his side. Darkness, a void.\n\nBut I could still see out the window.\n\nTeeth. It was only teeth. Canine, feline, human. Horse, cow, tusks of pigs. They weren't even lined up to look like a face. Moisture dripped from them, smearing the window and sizzling the glass with such acidity that would likely melt my bones.\n\n\"Am I not seen, and am I not real?\" It cooed with no mouth. The teeth ground together, but that was not the source of the voice.\n\nI hear the chitting writing this. Thousands of teeth vibrating with excitement, with sheer joy at just being looked upon. I knew at that moment that the desire was not innocent, no. I knew that I'd granted some terrible wish in some way.\n\n\"Can a friend be a mask?\" It chittered. \"Can salt hide underneath something so sweet? Two are not who they say, one loves the juice that beatsss.\" I could not back away, not even when it pressed against the glass. \"A name, it is-\"\n\nFinally Barrow got a grip on the flashlight, which had only taken seconds. I was pulled away from the face in the commotion and finally heard screaming. There was a struggle that I missed when the face pulled me into its gaze (or lack of). I wanted to throw up, to pull out my own teeth. They ached, as if they did not belong. No, they were mine! They ARE mine.\n\nMaggie was on the ground, halfway to the kitchen, and Evangel stood over her with one of Amber's glass-contained candles held high over her head.\n\nOnly it was not Evangel. It was that damn goblin.\n\n\"Bilgoth.\" I stuttered, thinking he was dead. My tongue touched my teeth. *Disgusting things*. \"It was *you*?!\"\n\n\"You killed Evangel?!\" Selene grabbed a mug from behind the counter discreetly.\n\nBilgoth, despite knowing the skin costume of Evangel was no longer working, did not release Maggie. \"No, I didn't! I told you I don't kill!\"\n\n\"Sure looks like you do.\" Barrow had his gun ready, steady with the flashlight. \"Drop the candle and release Maggie.\"\n\nTwo masks, the teeth said. One had been removed. \"I didn't kill no one you dumb bitch!\" Bilgoth snapped. \"She just came at me! Didn't realize I weren't human!\"\n\n\"He leapt on me the moment the light went out!\" She cried. \"Get it off of me!\"\n\n\"Put her down, goblin.\" Barrow warned again.\"\n\nA tense hesitation followed. Barrow didn't pull the trigger, but Bilgoth did not immediately release Maggie. All it took was the slightest movement of Barrow's finger for the goblin to let go of both. He held out his arms, surrendering. \"I didn't kill no one.\"\n\n\"How are you even alive? I thought Richard got rid of you.\" Seeing as Barrow had a gun, Selene put down the mug.\n\n\"Well apparently he did a bad job.\" The goblin chuckled. \"Cause I am still breathin. But I ain't killing. That ain't none of my business.\"\n\nSelene motioned for Maggie to move. \"Get away from it.\"\n\n\"No.\" Barrow moved the gun in Maggie's direction. \"No one moves.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nLook, you know at least I survived since I am writing this. Call it part one, cause there is plenty more. I'll have the rest for you in a few days, but I didn't want to post too much to chew. Sorry about the long wait on this one, things have been hard on me lately. I reached out to some family and, well... John was right. They don't know who I am. It wasn't as if I was close to them, or ever spoke with them at all. But they would at least know my name and who I am! I guess the knowledge that I had some sort of connection with someone was a comfort, even if I never used it. That is gone now...\n\nWill you all forget me too? I need to keep writing updates so that never happens.",

        "text": "I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place sure to never get any business. No human business, that is. Laura isn't a fly anymore, but we didn't exactly make progress. Jo came into the shop to see me (I don't know if she still wants to eat me though). In short, a lot of weird stuff happens. If you want to get caught up, or start at the beginning, then go ahead and check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) out.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nI still have the doll. In fact, as I am writing this, it is sitting next to my computer. Oh all the wishes it could grant me, all at a price that I wouldn't have to pay. Selene knows about it now, but just her. She advised me to keep it secret as there are many out there that might want to take it from me. That might seem like an easy solution, but how can I let it go on good conscience? Giving it to someone else would be no different than making a wish myself.\n\n\"Make a color that no one has ever seen.\" I mumbled as the burning sensation became too much to bear. That wish kept it busy for a while.\n\nIf you are wondering why I still have the doll, seeing as I said the Eye of Gold destroyed it, then make sure you are[ caught up.](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/108jn6s/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) If you are upset at how long it has been since an update, then I apologize. I am pretty shaken by the entire thing, as I think it is fair. We haven't seen John since he took Dan's place (it seems that *typing* John won't summon him). The store is fixed and back to normal, albeit a bit strange since Richard is working in the kitchen.\n\nOh yeah. Dan left. It only took a few days before he was gone, off to find the wife that didn't remember him. He hadn't forgotten her, however. Hadn't forgotten the years they spent together, nor the wedding that those years had led to. I really wish him luck, but I know what John said. Payton had no idea Dan existed and, if it were so easy to make her remember, I doubt John's words would have been so dire in his recounting. Dan was entirely unhelpful and unwilling to discuss the time he spent with Rykar. I tried getting answers out of him regarding Amber and her candles, but he was a closed case.\n\nSpeaking of; I don't appreciate Amber selling candles inside. Most of the time she is at her table next to the drive thru, not a bother to us inside. But occasionally she comes in to check on her little stand near the front door. I get a wink, maybe she'll come over for a flirty chat. I'm sure it is all to get me to buy a candle, but it all seems so genuine. She really does seem sweet. That is good for business, I guess.\n\nAnyway, we saved Em. She is awake now and even working. So we saved Em, lost John, and also lost Dan again. Richard wanted to be pissed, but when he heard that Selene was all part of the plan, he got quiet and kept his frustrations to himself. That was interesting, considering he was the owner. Perhaps he had so much trust invested in Selene that none of it mattered, or he didn't have the energy to deal with his store's manager. Either way, we were spared his wrath for the moment.\n\n\"I read your story.\" I sat down with Selene. She had begun to hang out in the lobby near her office door, keeping it open just in case the light turned off.\n\nShe smiled, but her face reddened. \"Oh yeah? Aren't I a great writer?\"\n\n\"Did all of that actually happen?\"\n\nSelene shrugged. \"Mostly. Maybe I embellished a little.\"\n\nShe was in too good a mood for me to spoil. I wanted to know about the hand thing, the deal she had made with Amber. It was identical to the one I struck with Rykar, flaming hand and all. Were they the same race? If that was the case, why wasn't she evil like Rykar? And, for that matter, was Rykar evil? Obviously he must be, considering he took both Dan and now John as slaves. I don't know and I didn't think it right to ruin a good day with hard questions.\n\n\"It was good.\" I honestly thought it was. \"You almost got killed.\"\n\n\"Eh, I was fine.\"\n\nThat was true. \"Seems like we both had a bit of recovery.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nAnd that was the extent of our conversation. The remainder of my break was spent in an awkward limbo, one in which we both mentioned something inconsequential and nodded about it. I found myself back on my shift, failing at both small talk and interrogation. I also screwed up, by the way. As you will remember, I mentioned 'my deal with Rykar' when I was recounting how we saved Em. Well, Selene read that. She hasn't pressed as hard as I would have expected, but she is very cautious. Selene only asked me once and I said I couldn't tell her. Multiple of you have said I should come clean, but coming clean won't help me break the deal; it will only make her trust me less and currently I am low on friends.\n\nThat bitch Heartmin came in again. This time we made her order without the two minute time frame, thank god. After she left, however, came the reason for this update.\n\n\"I can't see anything outside.\" Em said as she refilled our water dispenser by the door. The front of the store was a massive window and she was right, I couldn't see anything at all. Sure, it was night, but the light in the store and parking lot let us see what we needed to.\n\n\"Huh.\"\n\nBarrow went to the drive thru window. \"Same here. Selene?\" He went around the counter and into the lobby.\n\n\"Yeah?\" She didn't sound interested, as usual.\n\n\"It is pitch black outside.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" We'd interrupted something, apparently. \"It is night. That isn't new.\"\n\nBarrow, unaffected by her irritation, gestured at the glass wall across the lobby. \"No, I mean we can't see anything at all.\"\n\nFinally, she looked towards the window. \"Well that isn't right.\" Selene stood from her seat and approached the barrier that kept them from the dark. \"I've never seen this before. Unless...\" Moving to the other lobby (yes, there are two separated by three doorless frames) she grabbed the front door. \"Stay back, please.\"\n\nWhen we stepped away, she cracked the door open and looked down. \"Oh...\" She mumbled, then let the door shut gently. \"So, this isn't good.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Well, first of all, don't open any doors to the outside. Even the drive thru.\"\n\n\"What about customers?\"\n\nShe swallowed. \"We don't serve anything here.\" We waited for her to elaborate. \"And our main customer base won't find the cafe. Maybe? I don't know how this works exactly.\"\n\n\"Where are we, Selene?\" Evangel, who worked in the kitchen that day instead of Richard, was sure to stay near the kitchen and not take any risks.\n\n\"Var'lovya.\" I've never heard of that, but Selene explained its meaning. \"*Var* means 'eternity,' or for something to happen forever. *Lov* means 'aimless path.' This is the endless path. This is the void.\"\n\nA starless sky, like an overcast night. It was somehow deeper than that, as if my eyes could perceive an endless space. I could see nothing for all of eternity, a depth that consumed my mind the longer I stared into the abyss. Endless, yet there was nothing to see. Without bounds, but not one thing existed there with us.\n\nI still think about it, mostly at night when my eyes are shut. There is a darkness that is so great that your mind starts to place things within it so as to make up for its incapability to process it. I saw a face floating there in the depths, one that materialized into someone I once knew. Not them, I could not look upon them. But once my mind knew that, it was not able to bring forth a different image. The haunting visage of a woman with black hair came and went so rapidly that I could not appreciate her face, was fainter than even my memory of her.\n\nThen Em grabbed the door.\n\n\"Hey, don't go outside!\"\n\nShe pointed towards the void. \"My father...\"\n\n\"He isn't there.\"\n\n\"But...\" Her eyes were locked in the darkness. \"I can see him.\"\n\nSlowly Selene removed Em's hand from the door. \"He isn't there. No one is. *Nothing* is.\" She put herself in front of the door, barring our way out. \"There is nothing out there for any of us. This is our anchor, this store is our only way home. We are sailing through the abyss and *will* land. If anyone leaves, there will be no way home.\"\n\n\"How did we get here?\" Evangel did not come any closer. \"This isn't in the rules, but you know about it. Why isn't it in the rules?\"\n\n\"Because I've been here before. Not while working here as Richard's manager. We *shouldn't* be here, I don't even know how this is possible. What I *do* know is that we can get home if we just stay here. It might take time, but it will pass.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Barrow asked.\n\n\"Experience.\"\n\n\"Hey, what is this about?\" Another voice asked.\n\nRight, we had customers in the sitting lobby. \"Just a spill, don't worry! Go enjoy your meal!\" Selene tried.\n\nBefore the lights went out, I counted three cars aside from the employee's. That would be trouble.\n\n\"A spill?\" The well-dressed man challenged. He pointed outside. \"That does *not* look like a spill. What, did you spill ink all over the store?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" That wasn't going to work, so Selene sighed. \"There is an issue with the lights and it isn't safe outside. Please just stay here and stay calm.\"\n\n\"So you're locking us in?!\"\n\nA younger man, possibly a student of some kind, came in response to the commotion. \"We are locked in?!\"\n\n\"You know what? You are welcome to leave if you like!\" She snapped. \"Fall into an endless abyss for all I care! But don't let anything in!\" Selene crossed her arms and stepped aside. \"But not my employees. No, you all stay back!\"\n\n\"What is all this about?\" A young woman also joined the fray. \"Did you say we weren't allowed to leave? Also, why is it so dark? I can't see my car!\"\n\nAnd finally the last of the customers stepped out of the bathroom. An elderly man with a slow way about him. He was very tall, looming over any of the rest of us. Grandfatherly, I'd say; he made me feel somewhat comfortable just by being around.\n\n\"What's this then?\" He mumbled. \"Pretty dark outside, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You're all human?\"\n\n\"What do you mean *human*?!\" The business man growled, moving towards the door. \"You're all morons! I was an idiot to even come he-\" He opened the door.\n\nIf it weren't for his grip on the door, he would have tumbled into nothing forever. After a cry and a struggle with the hanging door, he managed to get himself inside with our aid. No one tried to open the door after that.\n\n\"What...\" He trailed off. \"Where... what is this?\"\n\n\"Again, are you all human?\" Selene asked.\n\n\"Y-yeah.\" The young man answered. The others gave nervous nods.\n\n\"That is unusual.\" She was right. Normal people were somewhat uncommon at the Drowsy Spectre. Four of them as our *only* customers were even stranger. But it would make the night easier, so I wasn't complaining.\n\nSelene lifted her head. \"We aren't connected to any actual power. The fact that we have any light at all is-\"\n\nEverything went dark. Thanks Selene.\n\nThump. What was that?\n\nSeconds of darkness followed before a flashlight clicked to life in Barrow's hands. \"Glad I have this.\"\n\n\"I have my phone.\" The young lady, as promised, flooded the area with her phone's flashlight. \"My battery isn't full, though.\"\n\n\"Same.\" The young man pulled his out. \"I'll save it.\"\n\n\"I'll be saving my battery, thanks!\" The well-dressed man backed towards the sitting lobby. \"And I suggest we all keep away from each other.\"\n\nThere was someone missing. \"Where is the old guy?\" Yeah, that was a rude way of putting it, but I was on edge.\n\nBarrow's flashlight swept the floor until it found something wet. That wet trail led the beam towards the kitchen, where the elderly man lay in a dark pool. Yeah, he was most certainly dead and that pool was most certainly his own blood.\n\nSelene grabbed Barrow's arm. \"Make sure *she* doesn't go out the door!\"\n\n\"He's dead!\" The young man cried out, stating the obvious.\n\nAnd, just to be certain, Evangel checked. \"Yeah. No pulse.\" She lifted her head as Selene approached. \"I didn't hear anything... why didn't we hear anything?\"\n\n\"I heard a thud.\" That was all I could offer.\n\n\"Who cares what you heard!\" The business man growled. \"A man is dead! Someone murdered him and we are all trapped in here with whoever did it!\"\n\nIt looked like I got myself into a classic murder mystery. Well, not very classic seeing as I was floating in a void. You know, that should scare me, shouldn't it? Now that I think about it, I wasn't as frightened of the spider lady either. When you see impossible things every day, I guess you become more intrigued than frightened. I don't know if that is a good thing. Certainly it can't be, seeing as I was curious rather than shocked when we found the dead elder on our cafe floor.\n\n\"It could be any of us.\" Evangel took a step back. \"Anyone could have done it!\"\n\nThe young man screamed. Barrow's flashlight found that he was fine and well. \"Sorry... sorry I am just a bit on edge right now, okay?\" He'd backed into a chair.\n\nSelene stood up from the body and turned off her phone flashlight. \"His eyes are gone.\" Her face remained cast-down. \"Dammit... dammit! How is this possible?!\"\n\n\"What aren't you telling us, Selene?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" She waved me off. Rude. \"But Evangel is right. He didn't trip, lose his eyes, and slit his own throat. Something did so rapidly when the dark came.\" Barrow still barred the door. \"Hook, don't turn off that flashlight. When the lights go, the void comes in.\"\n\n\"Didn't plan on it.\"\n\n\"First order of business is to get everyone in one place. Done. Next, what are your names?\"\n\n\"Rick.\" The business man replied. \"And I am quite done with all of this. What sort of drugs did you slip in me, huh?!\"\n\n\"Believe me, no one would want to drug you.\" She ignored his heated face and addressed the screamer. \"And you?\"\n\n\"Jack.\" The sudden attention drove him a step back, as if the question were a test he might fail.\n\nThen there was the last one, which did not wait to be called on. \"Maggie. Is this some kind of fucked up dream?\" She covered her mouth. \"Sorry, that just came out. Are y'all-\"\n\nSelene didn't care. \"You're fine. And all of you claim to be human?\"\n\n\"Claim to be?\" Rick challenged. \"How is that a claim? It is a fact.\"\n\n\"Not here it isn't.\"\n\n\"Well how do I fucking prove it to you, huh?\"\n\nSelene sighed. \"That is the question.\" Then, she placed the burden on me. On me! \"What do you think?\"\n\nI don't know anything! My only response was a shrug and a mumble. Only, I did have an emergency out. The doll in my jacket. I felt for it, but it was not there. \"Uh, there is a problem.\" I whispered to Selene.\n\nWith everyone staring, she leaned in. \"*What?*\" She was a bit harsh.\n\n\"The doll is gone.\"\n\n\"Do you need the doll to wish?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\n\"Something you'd like to share with the rest of us?\" Maggie pryed. \"Something we should know?\"\n\nEm joined Selene and I. \"I'm better now.\" She lifted her arms. \"Look, I am getting goosebumps. Literally. Look at my arms.\"\n\nAs promised, her hair was on end. \"Well you did almost walk into the void.\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Just thinking about it. See!\" Again, her arms had not changed. \"It is weird out there.\" She crossed her arms. \"Who's that?\"\n\nWas she gone, mentally, the entire time? \"You missed the dead guy?\" Selene asked, confused.\n\nBarrow stepped away from the door, bringing his flooding flashlight closer. \"You feeling okay, Em?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She crossed her arms. \"I'm just a bit confused is all.\"\n\n\"What do we do?\" He addressed Selene. \"You said we'd make it back if we waited?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Selene scratched her arm as she did when she was nervous. \"But how long will that take? This place doesn't like time.\"\n\n\"Doesn't *like* it?\" Rick interjected again. \"Make some sense! You still haven't told any of us why you'd ask if we were human!\"\n\nSelene snapped. \"Because not everyone here is, you dumbass! Shut up and let us think! We are trying to get you home without losing your damn eyes!\"\n\nClearly unaccustomed to being addressed in such a way, Rick was forced to back down slightly. Though I could see clearly on his face that he'd have more to say soon. My phone was at sixty percent, so I turned on the flashlight. I didn't want to rely on Barrow for my life, not with his inability to feel anything. Truth be told, I thought that would go away when I took the doll but he hadn't shown any signs that it had. Then again, perhaps it would just take time for him to adjust. I don't know; maybe I will bring it up with him.\n\n\"Are you human?\" Maggie asked.\n\nThat was a question Selene hesitated to answer. \"I didn't kill the old man, if that is what you are thinking.\"\n\n\"Who did?\" Jack stood away from the rest of the group, but he had his own flashlight on. He was listening. \"How do we find out?\"\n\n\"Who is packing?\" Barrow asked. They all glanced at each other, clearly asnwering his question. \"Then I am the only one.\" He revealed a weapon holstered at his belt. \"If this thing isn't human, this might not work on it. But it will work on the rest of you.\" The lack of emotion in his tone was intimidating, but I did not fear Barrow. They probably did.\n\nBut Rick found his voice. \"I don't feel comfortable that a stranger has the only gun when there has been a murder!\"\n\n\"So what, you think you should have it? None of us know you.\"\n\n\"I know how to shoot!\"\n\n\"Yeah, shoot us.\" Selene countered. \"That's probably what you want to do, huh?\"\n\nToo many eyes on him, Rick became nervous. Nervous meant more anger. \"Back off! I didn't move! I was in the same spot when that fella turned on his flashlight. Besides, how would a gun help me take out someone's eyes?!\" He lifted his fingers. \"No blood, either!\"\n\nEveryone else raised their hands, including me. Clean fingers. No one clawed out the old man's eyes and there was no way to clean up that fast.\n\n\"How do we know it was someone here? Selene said that the void could come in if the lights were off. Maybe something snuck in from out there?\"\n\nSelene considered my suggestion. \"It would still be here if that were the case. But...\" She moved to the other lobby. \"But the door is open.\"\n\nThe second lobby, meant for dining in, had a door of its own. Usually it was locked, but we had to bring some new tables and such after the disaster a few weeks back. Turns out we forgot to lock it back. And it was open. It doesn't close right, you see, so you have to give it a good pull. A customer must have come in through it and not realized it didn't close easily.\n\nSo it was left open for anything outside to enter.\n\n\"Well that puts us back to square one.\" Selene crossed her arms. \"If something came from the void, it has no power in the light. It is, effectively, one of us. But that flashlight might fail before we get home. Our phones too.\"\n\n\"We should pool them all together.\" Maggie suggested. \"So we can ration them. So no one wastes battery on themselves. Rick here has been trying to call people this whole time.\"\n\nIt was true, Rick had been dialing and texting ever since Selene shut him down. \"My phone, young lady. Mind your own business.\"\n\n\"This *is* our business!\" She explained. \"Not dying!\"\n\nWhile they fought, Selene joined in, Em grabbed my arm and pulled me behind the counter. \"I found your reddit thingy.\"\n\nThat wasn't good, but it was only a matter of time. \"And?\"\n\n\"You really remember everything we say?\"\n\nI was pretty good at that. \"Apparently.\"\n\n\"I read about the doll.\" She started, then lowered her voice. \"And about the deal.\"\n\nThat was *very* not good. I shouldn't have written about that. In fact, I might have to edit it out. \"Sshh!\" Em was already quiet, but who knows what magic ears Selene had! \"You can't tell here! I have to find a way to break it first!\"\n\n\"Obviously.\" She crossed her arms. \"Look, mister. I want to be your friend, okay? I know I screwed up but you have to understand that it was my father. I'm not trying to make excuses but I have nothing without him. So... so this is my offer. I'll keep your secret, and we are friends.\"\n\nI already forgave her *and* saved her life. But I liked Em. She had a way of lightening a dark mood, even if it was by her own confusion. \"Don't tell anyone.\" But could she be trusted with such a task? Also, what if Barrow read it too? \"About any of it. Not even the story.\"\n\n\"Dealio.\" She held out her hand. \"Shake?\"\n\nI stared at that hand. Something made me hesitate. I saw myself looking at that mirror, at the goat-headed man within. Hand outstretched, ocre fire engulfing. What was a deal to a pixie, and what sort of binding was I making? I had only to be her friend, and she mine. She had to keep my secret. What was one more bargain?\n\nSo we shook on it.\n\n\"Can you wish us out, though?\"\n\nThat's right. She knew I still had the doll. \"Did you tell Barrow?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No sir, mister. It is a secret now.\"\n\nEm was a bit too loud, but then Evangel approached. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Wait for Selene to make a decision.\" Em answered. \"As always. She said she knows about this place and all that.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nWith no further progress being made, we found ourselves huddled into our own respective groups. Well, some were loners. Selene and I sat in one corner, Barrow and Em nearby. The customers remained in the light of Barrow's strong flashlight, Evangel sat as far as she could from the front door. Selene and I were far too close to the window, she needed to see if anything came from the deep. I was torn. I feel most safe next to the person with strange magic powers, but also the least safe with only a glass barrier protecting me from infinite nothing.\n\nThere is a certain dread you get when looking up into space when there are no stars. When the street lights are too bright, the city drowns out the night sky. It is only black, endless and empty. Some fear tight spaces, but I cannot stand the thought of an endless expanse. It drew my eyes like the depths of the ocean, full of a terrible mystery that made my body ready to scramble away. I was far too alert, fully aware of every beat of my heart, of every second and how many there would be if I were to swim in the black.\n\nEventually I could not bear to look at it, nor even glance into the depths. I stared into the shop, whose corners were barely lit by Barrow's powerful light. I couldn't fall asleep with a murderer on the loose and there was no sign of who (or what) had killed the old man. Despite the danger, though, my eyelids were getting heavy. I felt safe with Selene, safe enough to close them even though I knew it wasn't wise.\n\n*Knock knock*\n\nMy eyes shot open. I knew I hadn't been asleep long, I'd only just shut my eyes. Had it been part of a dream? No, I hadn't been asleep long enough to have one.\n\n*Knock knock*\n\nAgainst my head I felt the vibrations, knuckles on glass. There was a face there, I could feel it. Something stared with such an emptiness; no malice, no anger, not even curiosity. There was just a presence that knocked, one that was simply watching.\n\nIt wanted only to be witnessed.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\nI saw Maggie across the room, she was looking in my direction. Past me. Finally, she made eye contact and shook her head. She had no color, so much so that I could tell in the white light Barrow provided. Her eyes were nearly out of their sockets with terror. \"Don't\" she mouthed and shook her head once more.\n\n\"Hey.\" Came a whisper from behind, from through the glass. So tender, so close. \"Hey, are you awake?\"\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n\"Knock once for yessss.\" A little thump as something pressed itself against the window wall. \"You have the sweet thing that make’st real. Is not my face pleasing? Will thy see it?\"\n\nThe voice was so thick, so wet, so full of the desire to simply be seen or heard. Again, Maggie shook her head, placing a finger to her mouth.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n\"On four a deal we shall strike. You like deals, I know. Four knocks, and I shall tell you who bled the man. Four knocksss.\" It licked the window slowly. \"Like honey is the deal we shall strike. Like a gentle kiss, I shall tell you, and you shall look upon me. Four knocks, and gaze sweetly upon me.\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nShould I look? Maggie was shaking her head no rapidly, whispering to look away. The others seemed to be sleeping too, no one was keeping watch.\n\n*Knock*\n\nWhat was one more deal? At this point I'd signed away pretty much all of my freedom. All the thing was asking for was to be seen, why was that a bad thing? Maggie was sweating, raising her voice from a horse whisper. \"Don't look!\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nSo close, the fourth knock. I would look, I decided. Surely I had seen worse at the shop and out in the woods. Even if I hadn't, every record was meant to be broken, right? Maggie rose to her feet, waving her arms, but she did not want to wake the others. \"Don't look!\" She risked it, then took a step forward. \"DON'T LOOK!\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nMy body tried to hold me in place, but I forced it to move. I couldn't breathe, not knowing that something terrible was waiting for me. We had to know, though, if we wanted to survive. Why did I move so slowly? Because I suddenly didn't want to look. After all I had seen, I became afraid. Goosebumps that would make Em proud sprouted across my arms and every hair reached to escape the face behind the glass. No, my body didn't want it and neither did I.\n\nBut I turned anyway.\n\n\"STOP!\"\n\nMaggie's shout woke up Barrow, and failed to leap to his feet. He kicked the flashlight and the beam vanished into his jacket, which sat by his side. Darkness, a void.\n\nBut I could still see out the window.\n\nTeeth. It was only teeth. Canine, feline, human. Horse, cow, tusks of pigs. They weren't even lined up to look like a face. Moisture dripped from them, smearing the window and sizzling the glass with such acidity that would likely melt my bones.\n\n\"Am I not seen, and am I not real?\" It cooed with no mouth. The teeth ground together, but that was not the source of the voice.\n\nI hear the chitting writing this. Thousands of teeth vibrating with excitement, with sheer joy at just being looked upon. I knew at that moment that the desire was not innocent, no. I knew that I'd granted some terrible wish in some way.\n\n\"Can a friend be a mask?\" It chittered. \"Can salt hide underneath something so sweet? Two are not who they say, one loves the juice that beatsss.\" I could not back away, not even when it pressed against the glass. \"A name, it is-\"\n\nFinally Barrow got a grip on the flashlight, which had only taken seconds. I was pulled away from the face in the commotion and finally heard screaming. There was a struggle that I missed when the face pulled me into its gaze (or lack of). I wanted to throw up, to pull out my own teeth. They ached, as if they did not belong. No, they were mine! They ARE mine.\n\nMaggie was on the ground, halfway to the kitchen, and Evangel stood over her with one of Amber's glass-contained candles held high over her head.\n\nOnly it was not Evangel. It was that damn goblin.\n\n\"Bilgoth.\" I stuttered, thinking he was dead. My tongue touched my teeth. *Disgusting things*. \"It was *you*?!\"\n\n\"You killed Evangel?!\" Selene grabbed a mug from behind the counter discreetly.\n\nBilgoth, despite knowing the skin costume of Evangel was no longer working, did not release Maggie. \"No, I didn't! I told you I don't kill!\"\n\n\"Sure looks like you do.\" Barrow had his gun ready, steady with the flashlight. \"Drop the candle and release Maggie.\"\n\nTwo masks, the teeth said. One had been removed. \"I didn't kill no one you dumb bitch!\" Bilgoth snapped. \"She just came at me! Didn't realize I weren't human!\"\n\n\"He leapt on me the moment the light went out!\" She cried. \"Get it off of me!\"\n\n\"Put her down, goblin.\" Barrow warned again.\"\n\nA tense hesitation followed. Barrow didn't pull the trigger, but Bilgoth did not immediately release Maggie. All it took was the slightest movement of Barrow's finger for the goblin to let go of both. He held out his arms, surrendering. \"I didn't kill no one.\"\n\n\"How are you even alive? I thought Richard got rid of you.\" Seeing as Barrow had a gun, Selene put down the mug.\n\n\"Well apparently he did a bad job.\" The goblin chuckled. \"Cause I am still breathin. But I ain't killing. That ain't none of my business.\"\n\nSelene motioned for Maggie to move. \"Get away from it.\"\n\n\"No.\" Barrow moved the gun in Maggie's direction. \"No one moves.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nLook, you know at least I survived since I am writing this. Call it part one, cause there is plenty more. I'll have the rest for you in a few days, but I didn't want to post too much to chew. Sorry about the long wait on this one, things have been hard on me lately. I reached out to some family and, well... John was right. They don't know who I am. It wasn't as if I was close to them, or ever spoke with them at all. But they would at least know my name and who I am! I guess the knowledge that I had some sort of connection with someone was a comfort, even if I never used it. That is gone now...\n\nWill you all forget me too? I need to keep writing updates so that never happens.",

        "text": "I thought Daniel would be happy to hear [we had a solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10c9o7e/how_to_survive_college_the_most_awkward_family/) to the scratching at his door.  I mean, Maria certainly was.  She was acting like the problem was already over and done with once I explained what I’d found out.  I left out *how* I got my answers - I just said something vague about having connections in the folklore department.  I didn’t need to worry.  She was so focused on the solution that she didn’t even care about where it came from.  I barely stopped her from texting Daniel right there.\n\n“I should tell him in person,” I said.  “This is not an easy thing we’re asking him to do.”\n\nShe considered for a moment, her enthusiasm slightly dampened.\n\n“I suppose so,” she said reluctantly.  “But he shouldn’t have any trouble doing it, right?”\n\n“Do *you* think you could kill a monster?”\n\nOf course, she said.  If it was her life on the line.  Hadn’t she managed to throw the insecticide on that thing with no problems?  I mean, she *did*, but I feel like Daniel’s trial wouldn’t be so simple.  I doubted he could just walk up to that larva without it noticing him.  It wouldn’t be a trial otherwise.\n\nAlso Maria is, uh, not exactly a realist about anything, but especially her own capabilities.  I’d tell him myself, I insisted.\n\n (if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/)) \n\nI texted Daniel and asked if he’d meet me at the student union.  I’d found a solution to the scratching problem, I said.\n\nHe made time to meet me immediately after my text.  I hustled over to the union and found him already there, waiting for me at one of the small tables against the wall in the cafeteria area.  \n\n“So?” he demanded as I slid into the chair and dropped my backpack on the ground.  “What do I do?”\n\nI told him.  He had to kill it, I said.  It likely didn’t matter how, but I couldn’t be certain of that.  We’d figure out how to get him a weapon of some kind - fire, maybe, or something blunt.  Heck, we could probably even drive to the nearest large town and find an outdoorsy store and get him a gun if he wanted to try that.  I was talking fast, trying to think of ideas to make this whole situation sound better, because Daniel’s face was turning ugly the longer I talked.  He was breathing in short, angry huffs and I began to feel like the situation was spiraling out of my hands.\n\nI expected him to be upset.  I did not expect him to be angry.\n\n“I just, go in there,” he said, his words clipped, “with that - that *thing* \\- and kill it?”\n\n“Yeah.  That’s it,” I said hopefully.\n\n“That’s *it*?  You said it was ignoring you and Maria because you weren’t its prey.  But I *am*.”\n\n“It’s probably best to assume it’s going to notice you.”\n\nI was trying to be careful with my words.  I didn’t want to spook him by speaking in absolutes.  I think we were long past that point, though, because he stood up, throwing his chair back as he did and it toppled to the ground.  He stood there, towering over me, and I shrank in my seat.\n\nPeople were staring.  Weren’t they staring?  They heard the chair fall.  I didn’t want to look.\n\n“That’s it?” he shouted.  “That’s all you’re going to do?”\n\nHis yelling was starting to attract attention.  I gestured for him to sit back down and hopefully lower his voice in the process.  He did neither.\n\n“You say you want to help but then you just foist something like this off on me and that’s *it*?  I bet you’re just going to go back to your dorm, congratulate yourself on a job well done, and sleep soundly while I’m off having to deal with this - this *bullshit!*” \n\nThen he glanced around, perhaps realizing that he was making a scene.  He teetered for a moment and I tried to think of something I could say to salvage this situation for him.  But the words were caught in my throat, I was frozen in place, and then he was turning and walking away and the moment was lost.\n\nThe room was unnaturally still for a moment.  I could hear whispering all around me.  I wanted to sink into the earth and die.  That wasn’t an option, so instead I grabbed my backpack and bolted for the door, keeping my head down and trying to pretend all those stares and all that whispering wasn’t about me.\n\nI cried as I walked.  I could send him a text, I thought.  Apologize.  But what would I even apologize for?  There wasn’t anything I could do.  These creatures didn’t follow the rules I was familiar with but there *were* rules and this was one of them.\n\nHe had to be the one to kill it.\n\nI called Maria.  Yes, this is how upset I was.  I called her.  Speaking.  Over the phone.\n\nShe was his friend before I was (if I ever counted as a friend), after all, and ran the Rain Chasers for a year which meant she had some kind of leadership skills, right?  Maybe she could talk him down and we’d figure out how we could support him.\n\nIt took a little bit to get the whole story out, on account of the crying and general incoherence.  Maria was patient and eventually she had a rough understanding of what happened.\n\n“Okay, I’ll talk to him,” she finally said.  “I figured he’d be excited by the news but I guess I should have thought about how he’s really freaked out by all this and he’s not sleeping hardly at all.”\n\nOf course.  He’s trying to stay up so he hears the scratching and then he’s probably having trouble falling asleep after that, considering he’s facing a horrific death and all.  I tried to swallow the lump in my throat.\n\n“Tell him I’m sorry,” I said.\n\n“I am not doing that.  He shouldn’t have yelled at you.  You’re trying to help.  We both are.  Don’t contact him and let me take care of this first, okay?”\n\nMaria can actually be really insightful when she stops a moment to think.  She’s kind of like my opposite in that regard, I think.  I overthink to the point of paralysis, she doesn’t stop to think to the point of recklessness.  But I can keep from making stupid decisions in the moment and Maria can handle things when she’s given the space to think it through.\n\nI guess that’s teamwork.\n\nI know I sound all rational while I’m writing this, but I promise you, that was not the case in the moment.  I was still a mess when I hung up the phone.  That whole overthinking things bit?  Yeah.  It felt like my brain was working overtime to come up with every horrible scenario, mostly about Daniel’s gruesome death after he peeled all his skin off with his fingernails and how Maria and Cassie and the like four other people I vaguely know on campus all hate me for not saving him.\n\nI wasn’t so preoccupied with my thoughts to not notice that it was starting to sprinkle.  The damn rain.  Feels like it falls every other day now.  I immediately turned and started walking briskly back towards my dorm.  I didn’t care to return to the student union, not after Daniel caused a scene.  I could surely get back home before the rain turned dangerous.\n\n“You’re pathetic,” a voice whispered from all around me.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat.  I broke into a jog, holding onto my backpack straps to keep it from bouncing around on my back.  My dorm was on the other side of campus.  I didn’t know how long I had before the flickering man could attack me without breaking the rules.\n\n“I got away from you twice now,” I replied, panting.  “What’s that say about you?”\n\n“An *infuriating* situation.”  \n\nThe voice sounded like it was right next to me.  A raindrop fell on my cheek.\n\n“One I intend to remedy.”\n\nIf I couldn’t make it to the dorm in time, there were always the steam tunnels.  Those could get me all the way to my dorm without being out in the rain.  I only needed to find an open building, of which there were many to choose from.  I veered to the nearest door.  I didn’t know what building this was, but it was a flat one-story building that looked like it might be a mixture of offices, administrative, and perhaps a few classrooms judging by what I could see through the darkened windows.  The door was unlocked and I ducked inside, pulling it shut behind me.\n\nI waited there a few minutes, clutching the handle to hold it shut, waiting to make sure that the flickering man hadn’t gotten inside with me.\n\nHe hadn’t.\n\nHis fists slammed against the glass.  His face was mere inches from the pane, leering down at me with a broad, malicious smile.  He clenched his fists, spreading his fingers out and sliding them down until his palms were opposite mine, separated only by the thin sheet of glass.\n\n“You can’t avoid me forever,” he murmured.  “You’ll slip up at some point.  You’re only human, after all.”\n\nI swallowed nervously and stepped away from the door.  He wasn’t trying to get in.  Didn’t it hurt him to leave the rain?  He seemed content to taunt me from outside, where he was close to the rain.  He stood under an overhang, but he only needed to take one step back to return to it.\n\nExcept.\n\nExcept the laundry lady said I needed to make him angry enough to break the rules.\n\nOkay.  I could do this.\n\nI kicked the door.  Kicked it open right into his face.\n\nI heard a crunch that I can only hope was his nose.  I certainly didn’t stick around to find out.  I was already off and running through the building in search of the stairs into the basement while he howled with pain and rage behind me.\n\nThe door to the building banged open.  I skidded around a corner.  These buildings tended to have similar layouts on the inside.  Stairs leading up or down were usually in the middle or the far ends.  Sure enough, at the end of the hallway, I saw a battered metal door, a stark contrast from the rest of the doors in the hallway.  That had to be it.  I hit it at a run and plummeted down the stairs, running down them as fast as I dared.  At the bottom of the stairwell was another door.  No basement.  Just the steam tunnels.  I took a breath and shoved it open.\n\nThe dim fluorescent lights greeted me.  The tunnel was silent save for my ragged breathing and the faint hiss of steam in the pipes.  I carefully pulled the door shut behind me, heart pounding, hoping that the flickering man was still searching for me upstairs.\n\nA hand shot through the gap.  Fingers closed over my wrist and then he shouldered the door open and stepped through.\n\n“That was *rude*,” he hissed.\n\nBlood coated his face.  I *had* broken his nose.  I can feel satisfied about that now.  I broke his damn nose!  Go.  Me.\n\nBut at the time, I was nothing but pure panic, jerking in his grip like a rabbit trapped in a snare.\n\n“I can’t kill you right here and now,” he said grimly, “but maybe I can bend the rules a bit.  What do you think?  Worth a try?”\n\nHis grip tightened.  He turned, holding the door in front of him open, and he tugged at my arm.  He was going to drag me out there.  Out into the rain.  Force whatever condition that constituted a violation of the rules to occur so that he could kill me without getting in trouble with the administration.\n\nI didn’t know what else to do, so I went limp.  Just let my knees buckle and I collapsed to the ground, my legs weak and my shoulders trembling.  The flickering man retained hold of my wrist, but he turned back and stared down at me in exasperation.  I stared dumbly up at him, pushed past the point of being able to think.  I just… *sat there*… not able to cooperate, not able to fight.  \n\n“I am not above carrying you out there,” he threatened.  “Don’t think I’m not.”\n\nSomething warm brushed over my ankles.  I glanced down in instinct.  It felt like every movement I made was sluggish.  Like time was slowing down.\n\nSteam.  It was seeping up through the ground.  It was already curling over my ankles and climbing to the top of my thighs.\n\nBut that shouldn’t be possible, some distant part of my mind was thinking.  I was sitting on concrete.\n\nSharp pain lanced through my elbow.  My body jolted in response, but my knees remained locked and my legs refused to cooperate, leaving me sitting sprawled on the ground as the flickering man tried unsuccessfully to pull me to my feet.  He swore, torn between abandoning his prey and the temptation I presented, right there in front of him, so close to being rightfully his.\n\nIn the end, his anger won out.  He swore at me.  He called me some things that wouldn’t have felt like an insult - food, livestock - but the contempt he hurled them with felt like knives, all the way down to my bones.  I stayed stubbornly silent, shaking with passive denial.\n\nFinally, he stepped half over me, his back against the steam tunnel walls in his attempt to get behind me in this confined space.  He stooped, hooked his hands under my armpits, and pulled.\n\nInhuman strength.  I was unceremoniously hoisted into the air.  This time, I fought back.  I jabbed backwards with an elbow.  He shifted and it went harmlessly past his head.  A pity.  I was hoping for the satisfying crunch of it landing in his already broken nose.\n\n“I have *never* had to work this hard for a meal,” he said.  “*Never*.”\n\nHe sounded more offended than angry.  How *dare* I make this difficult for him.  The *nerve*.\n\nHe looped his arms under my armpits and dragged me backwards towards the door.  I remained dead weight, lifting my feet off the ground and kicking at his shins.  The back of my heel impacted against his legs and he grunted at the impact, but otherwise seemed impervious to the pain.\n\nThen the steam took form in front of us.  A face peeled out of the vapor, mouth open, hair billowing around it to fill the hallway.  It reached out with a hand, fingers sharp like needles, and it let out a screech like the whistling of a tea kettle.\n\nBehind me, the flickering man shrieked.  And in panic, he shoved me straight at the steam ghost.\n\nSearing heat enveloped me.  It stole the air out of my lungs.  I couldn’t breathe.  \n\nThe only way was through.  I stumbled forward, covering my face with my hands.  Tendrils of steam wrapped around my arms and legs like fingers, then slid off just as quickly, like ropes of hair.  They tugged on me, pulling me this way and that, and I stumbled blindly in the steam.  I didn’t dare open my eyes or take my hands away from my face.  I could feel the heat searing into the back of my hands.  I felt like I was drowning, my lungs aching for air.\n\nThen the steam gripped my elbow, tugged, and slipped away just as quickly.  I stumbled in the direction it had pulled and my head hit against one of the overhead pipes.  There was a flash of heat, I jerked away, and staggered into the opposite wall.\n\nThere.  Something to guide myself with.  I kept one elbow against the wall and ran forwards, heart hammering, the roughness of the brick tearing into the cloth of my shirt.  It didn’t matter.  I barely felt it.  I plunged through the heat and the damp, blind, suffocating, and then cool air struck my face.  It enveloped me like a fall breeze and I knew I was through.\n\nI removed my hands and opened my eyes.  The tunnel ahead of me was clear.  I whipped around to look behind me.\n\nThe steam was dissipating.  It wafted across the floor like a morning mist, burning away with the rising sun.  The door leading out of the tunnels was hanging wide open.\n\nThe flickering man was gone.\n\nI didn’t wait around any longer.  I turned and ran down the steam tunnels, as fast as I dared, until I found my way back to the basement of my dorms.\n\nYes, I’m okay.  Keeping my face covered was the right move, because only the exposed parts of my skin got burned… which is just my hands.  They look like I scalded them with hot water and I’m putting aloe on them and it should be fine.\n\nThe flickering man is being careful though.  If the steam ghost hadn’t scared him off, he’d have carried me out into the rain just so that he could stay within the rules.  I don’t think this is going to be as easy as the laundry lady made it sound.  He’s not some stupid creature of instinct and hunger.  We’re locked into this game now, waiting to see who slips up first.\n\nI don’t feel good about my odds.  I’m up against an inhuman creature, something that’s older than me, stronger in every way, and who has the advantage of knowledge on his side.  I thought the laundry lady asking for me to do this with her meant that she believed I was capable of it, but now I’m wondering… what if she was just looking for someone convenient?  The devil himself said there’s nothing special about me, I just happened to be someone with the right background and in the right place for him.  \n\nWhat if it's the same thing with the laundry lady?  And if I fail, then she simply tries something else?\n\nI can’t back out.  The only thing I can do is keep going forward.  That’s the only way left for me.  But I’m not the only person with no options left.\n\nI’m going to let Maria talk to Daniel first.  He needs to calm down first.  Then I’ll have a talk with him myself and tell him that it’s not right and it’s not fair what’s happening to him.  But the only way he can go is forward and when he’s through, when it’s done and he’s out, we’ll be waiting for him on the other side.

        "text": " I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place sure to never get any business. No human business, that is. Laura isn't a fly anymore, but we didn't exactly make progress. Jo came into the shop to see me (I don't know if she still wants to eat me though). In short, a lot of weird stuff happens. If you want to get caught up, or start at the beginning, then go ahead and check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) out.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nI still have the doll. In fact, as I am writing this, it is sitting next to my computer. Oh all the wishes it could grant me, all at a price that I wouldn't have to pay. Selene knows about it now, but just her. She advised me to keep it secret as there are many out there that might want to take it from me. That might seem like an easy solution, but how can I let it go on good conscience? Giving it to someone else would be no different than making a wish myself.\n\n\"Make a color that no one has ever seen.\" I mumbled as the burning sensation became too much to bear. That wish kept it busy for a while.\n\nIf you are wondering why I still have the doll, seeing as I said the Eye of Gold destroyed it, then make sure you are[ caught up.](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/108jn6s/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) If you are upset at how long it has been since an update, then I apologize. I am pretty shaken by the entire thing, as I think it is fair. We haven't seen John since he took Dan's place (it seems that *typing* John won't summon him). The store is fixed and back to normal, albeit a bit strange since Richard is working in the kitchen.\n\nOh yeah. Dan left. It only took a few days before he was gone, off to find the wife that didn't remember him. He hadn't forgotten her, however. Hadn't forgotten the years they spent together, nor the wedding that those years had led to. I really wish him luck, but I know what John said. Payton had no idea Dan existed and, if it were so easy to make her remember, I doubt John's words would have been so dire in his recounting. Dan was entirely unhelpful and unwilling to discuss the time he spent with Rykar. I tried getting answers out of him regarding Amber and her candles, but he was a closed case.\n\nSpeaking of; I don't appreciate Amber selling candles inside. Most of the time she is at her table next to the drive thru, not a bother to us inside. But occasionally she comes in to check on her little stand near the front door. I get a wink, maybe she'll come over for a flirty chat. I'm sure it is all to get me to buy a candle, but it all seems so genuine. She really does seem sweet. That is good for business, I guess.\n\nAnyway, we saved Em. She is awake now and even working. So we saved Em, lost John, and also lost Dan again. Richard wanted to be pissed, but when he heard that Selene was all part of the plan, he got quiet and kept his frustrations to himself. That was interesting, considering he was the owner. Perhaps he had so much trust invested in Selene that none of it mattered, or he didn't have the energy to deal with his store's manager. Either way, we were spared his wrath for the moment.\n\n\"I read your story.\" I sat down with Selene. She had begun to hang out in the lobby near her office door, keeping it open just in case the light turned off.\n\nShe smiled, but her face reddened. \"Oh yeah? Aren't I a great writer?\"\n\n\"Did all of that actually happen?\"\n\nSelene shrugged. \"Mostly. Maybe I embellished a little.\"\n\nShe was in too good a mood for me to spoil. I wanted to know about the hand thing, the deal she had made with Amber. It was identical to the one I struck with Rykar, flaming hand and all. Were they the same race? If that was the case, why wasn't she evil like Rykar? And, for that matter, was Rykar evil? Obviously he must be, considering he took both Dan and now John as slaves. I don't know and I didn't think it right to ruin a good day with hard questions.\n\n\"It was good.\" I honestly thought it was. \"You almost got killed.\"\n\n\"Eh, I was fine.\"\n\nThat was true. \"Seems like we both had a bit of recovery.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nAnd that was the extent of our conversation. The remainder of my break was spent in an awkward limbo, one in which we both mentioned something inconsequential and nodded about it. I found myself back on my shift, failing at both small talk and interrogation. I also screwed up, by the way. As you will remember, I mentioned 'my deal with Rykar' when I was recounting how we saved Em. Well, Selene read that. She hasn't pressed as hard as I would have expected, but she is very cautious. Selene only asked me once and I said I couldn't tell her. Multiple of you have said I should come clean, but coming clean won't help me break the deal; it will only make her trust me less and currently I am low on friends.\n\nThat bitch Heartmin came in again. This time we made her order without the two minute time frame, thank god. After she left, however, came the reason for this update.\n\n\"I can't see anything outside.\" Em said as she refilled our water dispenser by the door. The front of the store was a massive window and she was right, I couldn't see anything at all. Sure, it was night, but the light in the store and parking lot let us see what we needed to.\n\n\"Huh.\"\n\nBarrow went to the drive thru window. \"Same here. Selene?\" He went around the counter and into the lobby.\n\n\"Yeah?\" She didn't sound interested, as usual.\n\n\"It is pitch black outside.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" We'd interrupted something, apparently. \"It is night. That isn't new.\"\n\nBarrow, unaffected by her irritation, gestured at the glass wall across the lobby. \"No, I mean we can't see anything at all.\"\n\nFinally, she looked towards the window. \"Well that isn't right.\" Selene stood from her seat and approached the barrier that kept them from the dark. \"I've never seen this before. Unless...\" Moving to the other lobby (yes, there are two separated by three doorless frames) she grabbed the front door. \"Stay back, please.\"\n\nWhen we stepped away, she cracked the door open and looked down. \"Oh...\" She mumbled, then let the door shut gently. \"So, this isn't good.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Well, first of all, don't open any doors to the outside. Even the drive thru.\"\n\n\"What about customers?\"\n\nShe swallowed. \"We don't serve anything here.\" We waited for her to elaborate. \"And our main customer base won't find the cafe. Maybe? I don't know how this works exactly.\"\n\n\"Where are we, Selene?\" Evangel, who worked in the kitchen that day instead of Richard, was sure to stay near the kitchen and not take any risks.\n\n\"Var'lovya.\" I've never heard of that, but Selene explained its meaning. \"*Var* means 'eternity,' or for something to happen forever. *Lov* means 'aimless path.' This is the endless path. This is the void.\"\n\nA starless sky, like an overcast night. It was somehow deeper than that, as if my eyes could perceive an endless space. I could see nothing for all of eternity, a depth that consumed my mind the longer I stared into the abyss. Endless, yet there was nothing to see. Without bounds, but not one thing existed there with us.\n\nI still think about it, mostly at night when my eyes are shut. There is a darkness that is so great that your mind starts to place things within it so as to make up for its incapability to process it. I saw a face floating there in the depths, one that materialized into someone I once knew. Not them, I could not look upon them. But once my mind knew that, it was not able to bring forth a different image. The haunting visage of a woman with black hair came and went so rapidly that I could not appreciate her face, was fainter than even my memory of her.\n\nThen Em grabbed the door.\n\n\"Hey, don't go outside!\"\n\nShe pointed towards the void. \"My father...\"\n\n\"He isn't there.\"\n\n\"But...\" Her eyes were locked in the darkness. \"I can see him.\"\n\nSlowly Selene removed Em's hand from the door. \"He isn't there. No one is. *Nothing* is.\" She put herself in front of the door, barring our way out. \"There is nothing out there for any of us. This is our anchor, this store is our only way home. We are sailing through the abyss and *will* land. If anyone leaves, there will be no way home.\"\n\n\"How did we get here?\" Evangel did not come any closer. \"This isn't in the rules, but you know about it. Why isn't it in the rules?\"\n\n\"Because I've been here before. Not while working here as Richard's manager. We *shouldn't* be here, I don't even know how this is possible. What I *do* know is that we can get home if we just stay here. It might take time, but it will pass.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Barrow asked.\n\n\"Experience.\"\n\n\"Hey, what is this about?\" Another voice asked.\n\nRight, we had customers in the sitting lobby. \"Just a spill, don't worry! Go enjoy your meal!\" Selene tried.\n\nBefore the lights went out, I counted three cars aside from the employee's. That would be trouble.\n\n\"A spill?\" The well-dressed man challenged. He pointed outside. \"That does *not* look like a spill. What, did you spill ink all over the store?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" That wasn't going to work, so Selene sighed. \"There is an issue with the lights and it isn't safe outside. Please just stay here and stay calm.\"\n\n\"So you're locking us in?!\"\n\nA younger man, possibly a student of some kind, came in response to the commotion. \"We are locked in?!\"\n\n\"You know what? You are welcome to leave if you like!\" She snapped. \"Fall into an endless abyss for all I care! But don't let anything in!\" Selene crossed her arms and stepped aside. \"But not my employees. No, you all stay back!\"\n\n\"What is all this about?\" A young woman also joined the fray. \"Did you say we weren't allowed to leave? Also, why is it so dark? I can't see my car!\"\n\nAnd finally the last of the customers stepped out of the bathroom. An elderly man with a slow way about him. He was very tall, looming over any of the rest of us. Grandfatherly, I'd say; he made me feel somewhat comfortable just by being around.\n\n\"What's this then?\" He mumbled. \"Pretty dark outside, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You're all human?\"\n\n\"What do you mean *human*?!\" The business man growled, moving towards the door. \"You're all morons! I was an idiot to even come he-\" He opened the door.\n\nIf it weren't for his grip on the door, he would have tumbled into nothing forever. After a cry and a struggle with the hanging door, he managed to get himself inside with our aid. No one tried to open the door after that.\n\n\"What...\" He trailed off. \"Where... what is this?\"\n\n\"Again, are you all human?\" Selene asked.\n\n\"Y-yeah.\" The young man answered. The others gave nervous nods.\n\n\"That is unusual.\" She was right. Normal people were somewhat uncommon at the Drowsy Spectre. Four of them as our *only* customers were even stranger. But it would make the night easier, so I wasn't complaining.\n\nSelene lifted her head. \"We aren't connected to any actual power. The fact that we have any light at all is-\"\n\nEverything went dark. Thanks Selene.\n\nThump. What was that?\n\nSeconds of darkness followed before a flashlight clicked to life in Barrow's hands. \"Glad I have this.\"\n\n\"I have my phone.\" The young lady, as promised, flooded the area with her phone's flashlight. \"My battery isn't full, though.\"\n\n\"Same.\" The young man pulled his out. \"I'll save it.\"\n\n\"I'll be saving my battery, thanks!\" The well-dressed man backed towards the sitting lobby. \"And I suggest we all keep away from each other.\"\n\nThere was someone missing. \"Where is the old guy?\" Yeah, that was a rude way of putting it, but I was on edge.\n\nBarrow's flashlight swept the floor until it found something wet. That wet trail led the beam towards the kitchen, where the elderly man lay in a dark pool. Yeah, he was most certainly dead and that pool was most certainly his own blood.\n\nSelene grabbed Barrow's arm. \"Make sure *she* doesn't go out the door!\"\n\n\"He's dead!\" The young man cried out, stating the obvious.\n\nAnd, just to be certain, Evangel checked. \"Yeah. No pulse.\" She lifted her head as Selene approached. \"I didn't hear anything... why didn't we hear anything?\"\n\n\"I heard a thud.\" That was all I could offer.\n\n\"Who cares what you heard!\" The business man growled. \"A man is dead! Someone murdered him and we are all trapped in here with whoever did it!\"\n\nIt looked like I got myself into a classic murder mystery. Well, not very classic seeing as I was floating in a void. You know, that should scare me, shouldn't it? Now that I think about it, I wasn't as frightened of the spider lady either. When you see impossible things every day, I guess you become more intrigued than frightened. I don't know if that is a good thing. Certainly it can't be, seeing as I was curious rather than shocked when we found the dead elder on our cafe floor.\n\n\"It could be any of us.\" Evangel took a step back. \"Anyone could have done it!\"\n\nThe young man screamed. Barrow's flashlight found that he was fine and well. \"Sorry... sorry I am just a bit on edge right now, okay?\" He'd backed into a chair.\n\nSelene stood up from the body and turned off her phone flashlight. \"His eyes are gone.\" Her face remained cast-down. \"Dammit... dammit! How is this possible?!\"\n\n\"What aren't you telling us, Selene?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" She waved me off. Rude. \"But Evangel is right. He didn't trip, lose his eyes, and slit his own throat. Something did so rapidly when the dark came.\" Barrow still barred the door. \"Hook, don't turn off that flashlight. When the lights go, the void comes in.\"\n\n\"Didn't plan on it.\"\n\n\"First order of business is to get everyone in one place. Done. Next, what are your names?\"\n\n\"Rick.\" The business man replied. \"And I am quite done with all of this. What sort of drugs did you slip in me, huh?!\"\n\n\"Believe me, no one would want to drug you.\" She ignored his heated face and addressed the screamer. \"And you?\"\n\n\"Jack.\" The sudden attention drove him a step back, as if the question were a test he might fail.\n\nThen there was the last one, which did not wait to be called on. \"Maggie. Is this some kind of fucked up dream?\" She covered her mouth. \"Sorry, that just came out. Are y'all-\"\n\nSelene didn't care. \"You're fine. And all of you claim to be human?\"\n\n\"Claim to be?\" Rick challenged. \"How is that a claim? It is a fact.\"\n\n\"Not here it isn't.\"\n\n\"Well how do I fucking prove it to you, huh?\"\n\nSelene sighed. \"That is the question.\" Then, she placed the burden on me. On me! \"What do you think?\"\n\nI don't know anything! My only response was a shrug and a mumble. Only, I did have an emergency out. The doll in my jacket. I felt for it, but it was not there. \"Uh, there is a problem.\" I whispered to Selene.\n\nWith everyone staring, she leaned in. \"*What?*\" She was a bit harsh.\n\n\"The doll is gone.\"\n\n\"Do you need the doll to wish?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\n\"Something you'd like to share with the rest of us?\" Maggie pryed. \"Something we should know?\"\n\nEm joined Selene and I. \"I'm better now.\" She lifted her arms. \"Look, I am getting goosebumps. Literally. Look at my arms.\"\n\nAs promised, her hair was on end. \"Well you did almost walk into the void.\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Just thinking about it. See!\" Again, her arms had not changed. \"It is weird out there.\" She crossed her arms. \"Who's that?\"\n\nWas she gone, mentally, the entire time? \"You missed the dead guy?\" Selene asked, confused.\n\nBarrow stepped away from the door, bringing his flooding flashlight closer. \"You feeling okay, Em?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She crossed her arms. \"I'm just a bit confused is all.\"\n\n\"What do we do?\" He addressed Selene. \"You said we'd make it back if we waited?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Selene scratched her arm as she did when she was nervous. \"But how long will that take? This place doesn't like time.\"\n\n\"Doesn't *like* it?\" Rick interjected again. \"Make some sense! You still haven't told any of us why you'd ask if we were human!\"\n\nSelene snapped. \"Because not everyone here is, you dumbass! Shut up and let us think! We are trying to get you home without losing your damn eyes!\"\n\nClearly unaccustomed to being addressed in such a way, Rick was forced to back down slightly. Though I could see clearly on his face that he'd have more to say soon. My phone was at sixty percent, so I turned on the flashlight. I didn't want to rely on Barrow for my life, not with his inability to feel anything. Truth be told, I thought that would go away when I took the doll but he hadn't shown any signs that it had. Then again, perhaps it would just take time for him to adjust. I don't know; maybe I will bring it up with him.\n\n\"Are you human?\" Maggie asked.\n\nThat was a question Selene hesitated to answer. \"I didn't kill the old man, if that is what you are thinking.\"\n\n\"Who did?\" Jack stood away from the rest of the group, but he had his own flashlight on. He was listening. \"How do we find out?\"\n\n\"Who is packing?\" Barrow asked. They all glanced at each other, clearly asnwering his question. \"Then I am the only one.\" He revealed a weapon holstered at his belt. \"If this thing isn't human, this might not work on it. But it will work on the rest of you.\" The lack of emotion in his tone was intimidating, but I did not fear Barrow. They probably did.\n\nBut Rick found his voice. \"I don't feel comfortable that a stranger has the only gun when there has been a murder!\"\n\n\"So what, you think you should have it? None of us know you.\"\n\n\"I know how to shoot!\"\n\n\"Yeah, shoot us.\" Selene countered. \"That's probably what you want to do, huh?\"\n\nToo many eyes on him, Rick became nervous. Nervous meant more anger. \"Back off! I didn't move! I was in the same spot when that fella turned on his flashlight. Besides, how would a gun help me take out someone's eyes?!\" He lifted his fingers. \"No blood, either!\"\n\nEveryone else raised their hands, including me. Clean fingers. No one clawed out the old man's eyes and there was no way to clean up that fast.\n\n\"How do we know it was someone here? Selene said that the void could come in if the lights were off. Maybe something snuck in from out there?\"\n\nSelene considered my suggestion. \"It would still be here if that were the case. But...\" She moved to the other lobby. \"But the door is open.\"\n\nThe second lobby, meant for dining in, had a door of its own. Usually it was locked, but we had to bring some new tables and such after the disaster a few weeks back. Turns out we forgot to lock it back. And it was open. It doesn't close right, you see, so you have to give it a good pull. A customer must have come in through it and not realized it didn't close easily.\n\nSo it was left open for anything outside to enter.\n\n\"Well that puts us back to square one.\" Selene crossed her arms. \"If something came from the void, it has no power in the light. It is, effectively, one of us. But that flashlight might fail before we get home. Our phones too.\"\n\n\"We should pool them all together.\" Maggie suggested. \"So we can ration them. So no one wastes battery on themselves. Rick here has been trying to call people this whole time.\"\n\nIt was true, Rick had been dialing and texting ever since Selene shut him down. \"My phone, young lady. Mind your own business.\"\n\n\"This *is* our business!\" She explained. \"Not dying!\"\n\nWhile they fought, Selene joined in, Em grabbed my arm and pulled me behind the counter. \"I found your reddit thingy.\"\n\nThat wasn't good, but it was only a matter of time. \"And?\"\n\n\"You really remember everything we say?\"\n\nI was pretty good at that. \"Apparently.\"\n\n\"I read about the doll.\" She started, then lowered her voice. \"And about the deal.\"\n\nThat was *very* not good. I shouldn't have written about that. In fact, I might have to edit it out. \"Sshh!\" Em was already quiet, but who knows what magic ears Selene had! \"You can't tell here! I have to find a way to break it first!\"\n\n\"Obviously.\" She crossed her arms. \"Look, mister. I want to be your friend, okay? I know I screwed up but you have to understand that it was my father. I'm not trying to make excuses but I have nothing without him. So... so this is my offer. I'll keep your secret, and we are friends.\"\n\nI already forgave her *and* saved her life. But I liked Em. She had a way of lightening a dark mood, even if it was by her own confusion. \"Don't tell anyone.\" But could she be trusted with such a task? Also, what if Barrow read it too? \"About any of it. Not even the story.\"\n\n\"Dealio.\" She held out her hand. \"Shake?\"\n\nI stared at that hand. Something made me hesitate. I saw myself looking at that mirror, at the goat-headed man within. Hand outstretched, ocre fire engulfing. What was a deal to a pixie, and what sort of binding was I making? I had only to be her friend, and she mine. She had to keep my secret. What was one more bargain?\n\nSo we shook on it.\n\n\"Can you wish us out, though?\"\n\nThat's right. She knew I still had the doll. \"Did you tell Barrow?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No sir, mister. It is a secret now.\"\n\nEm was a bit too loud, but then Evangel approached. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Wait for Selene to make a decision.\" Em answered. \"As always. She said she knows about this place and all that.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nWith no further progress being made, we found ourselves huddled into our own respective groups. Well, some were loners. Selene and I sat in one corner, Barrow and Em nearby. The customers remained in the light of Barrow's strong flashlight, Evangel sat as far as she could from the front door. Selene and I were far too close to the window, she needed to see if anything came from the deep. I was torn. I feel most safe next to the person with strange magic powers, but also the least safe with only a glass barrier protecting me from infinite nothing.\n\nThere is a certain dread you get when looking up into space when there are no stars. When the street lights are too bright, the city drowns out the night sky. It is only black, endless and empty. Some fear tight spaces, but I cannot stand the thought of an endless expanse. It drew my eyes like the depths of the ocean, full of a terrible mystery that made my body ready to scramble away. I was far too alert, fully aware of every beat of my heart, of every second and how many there would be if I were to swim in the black.\n\nEventually I could not bear to look at it, nor even glance into the depths. I stared into the shop, whose corners were barely lit by Barrow's powerful light. I couldn't fall asleep with a murderer on the loose and there was no sign of who (or what) had killed the old man. Despite the danger, though, my eyelids were getting heavy. I felt safe with Selene, safe enough to close them even though I knew it wasn't wise.\n\n*Knock knock*\n\nMy eyes shot open. I knew I hadn't been asleep long, I'd only just shut my eyes. Had it been part of a dream? No, I hadn't been asleep long enough to have one.\n\n*Knock knock*\n\nAgainst my head I felt the vibrations, knuckles on glass. There was a face there, I could feel it. Something stared with such an emptiness; no malice, no anger, not even curiosity. There was just a presence that knocked, one that was simply watching.\n\nIt wanted only to be witnessed.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\nI saw Maggie across the room, she was looking in my direction. Past me. Finally, she made eye contact and shook her head. She had no color, so much so that I could tell in the white light Barrow provided. Her eyes were nearly out of their sockets with terror. \"Don't\" she mouthed and shook her head once more.\n\n\"Hey.\" Came a whisper from behind, from through the glass. So tender, so close. \"Hey, are you awake?\"\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n\"Knock once for yessss.\" A little thump as something pressed itself against the window wall. \"You have the sweet thing that make’st real. Is not my face pleasing? Will thy see it?\"\n\nThe voice was so thick, so wet, so full of the desire to simply be seen or heard. Again, Maggie shook her head, placing a finger to her mouth.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n\"On four a deal we shall strike. You like deals, I know. Four knocks, and I shall tell you who bled the man. Four knocksss.\" It licked the window slowly. \"Like honey is the deal we shall strike. Like a gentle kiss, I shall tell you, and you shall look upon me. Four knocks, and gaze sweetly upon me.\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nShould I look? Maggie was shaking her head no rapidly, whispering to look away. The others seemed to be sleeping too, no one was keeping watch.\n\n*Knock*\n\nWhat was one more deal? At this point I'd signed away pretty much all of my freedom. All the thing was asking for was to be seen, why was that a bad thing? Maggie was sweating, raising her voice from a horse whisper. \"Don't look!\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nSo close, the fourth knock. I would look, I decided. Surely I had seen worse at the shop and out in the woods. Even if I hadn't, every record was meant to be broken, right? Maggie rose to her feet, waving her arms, but she did not want to wake the others. \"Don't look!\" She risked it, then took a step forward. \"DON'T LOOK!\"\n\n*Knock*\n\nMy body tried to hold me in place, but I forced it to move. I couldn't breathe, not knowing that something terrible was waiting for me. We had to know, though, if we wanted to survive. Why did I move so slowly? Because I suddenly didn't want to look. After all I had seen, I became afraid. Goosebumps that would make Em proud sprouted across my arms and every hair reached to escape the face behind the glass. No, my body didn't want it and neither did I.\n\nBut I turned anyway.\n\n\"STOP!\"\n\nMaggie's shout woke up Barrow, and failed to leap to his feet. He kicked the flashlight and the beam vanished into his jacket, which sat by his side. Darkness, a void.\n\nBut I could still see out the window.\n\nTeeth. It was only teeth. Canine, feline, human. Horse, cow, tusks of pigs. They weren't even lined up to look like a face. Moisture dripped from them, smearing the window and sizzling the glass with such acidity that would likely melt my bones.\n\n\"Am I not seen, and am I not real?\" It cooed with no mouth. The teeth ground together, but that was not the source of the voice.\n\nI hear the chitting writing this. Thousands of teeth vibrating with excitement, with sheer joy at just being looked upon. I knew at that moment that the desire was not innocent, no. I knew that I'd granted some terrible wish in some way.\n\n\"Can a friend be a mask?\" It chittered. \"Can salt hide underneath something so sweet? Two are not who they say, one loves the juice that beatsss.\" I could not back away, not even when it pressed against the glass. \"A name, it is-\"\n\nFinally Barrow got a grip on the flashlight, which had only taken seconds. I was pulled away from the face in the commotion and finally heard screaming. There was a struggle that I missed when the face pulled me into its gaze (or lack of). I wanted to throw up, to pull out my own teeth. They ached, as if they did not belong. No, they were mine! They ARE mine.\n\nMaggie was on the ground, halfway to the kitchen, and Evangel stood over her with one of Amber's glass-contained candles held high over her head.\n\nOnly it was not Evangel. It was that damn goblin.\n\n\"Bilgoth.\" I stuttered, thinking he was dead. My tongue touched my teeth. *Disgusting things*. \"It was *you*?!\"\n\n\"You killed Evangel?!\" Selene grabbed a mug from behind the counter discreetly.\n\nBilgoth, despite knowing the skin costume of Evangel was no longer working, did not release Maggie. \"No, I didn't! I told you I don't kill!\"\n\n\"Sure looks like you do.\" Barrow had his gun ready, steady with the flashlight. \"Drop the candle and release Maggie.\"\n\nTwo masks, the teeth said. One had been removed. \"I didn't kill no one you dumb bitch!\" Bilgoth snapped. \"She just came at me! Didn't realize I weren't human!\"\n\n\"He leapt on me the moment the light went out!\" She cried. \"Get it off of me!\"\n\n\"Put her down, goblin.\" Barrow warned again.\"\n\nA tense hesitation followed. Barrow didn't pull the trigger, but Bilgoth did not immediately release Maggie. All it took was the slightest movement of Barrow's finger for the goblin to let go of both. He held out his arms, surrendering. \"I didn't kill no one.\"\n\n\"How are you even alive? I thought Richard got rid of you.\" Seeing as Barrow had a gun, Selene put down the mug.\n\n\"Well apparently he did a bad job.\" The goblin chuckled. \"Cause I am still breathin. But I ain't killing. That ain't none of my business.\"\n\nSelene motioned for Maggie to move. \"Get away from it.\"\n\n\"No.\" Barrow moved the gun in Maggie's direction. \"No one moves.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nLook, you know at least I survived since I am writing this. Call it part one, cause there is plenty more. I'll have the rest for you in a few days, but I didn't want to post too much to chew. Sorry about the long wait on this one, things have been hard on me lately. I reached out to some family and, well... John was right. They don't know who I am. It wasn't as if I was close to them, or ever spoke with them at all. But they would at least know my name and who I am! I guess the knowledge that I had some sort of connection with someone was a comfort, even if I never used it. That is gone now...\n\nWill you all forget me too? I need to keep writing updates so that never happens.",

        "text": "If you’re seeing this, me and my colleague are probably already dead. I’m a dog trainer in training and work more often with smaller breeds. The family had me and my co-worker come over, she said to not turn your back to the boat. They have a boat in their backyard near a trailer. I asked why, and the mother said that I don’t need to know yet.\n\nOk.. red flag already. She just wanted me to trust her about always one of us facing the boat. But, we just  went along with it. She also wanted us to make sure that the dogs didn’t go anywhere near the boat either)\n\nThey were taking a business trip with their kids as well for the week. They wanted us to train their dogs over the week with new tricks.\n\nMy colleague was showing me how to use treats for dog training, and how to get them to heel. She wanted me to try, and I kept facing the boat till she walked over to face it as well. We had to describe to each other in detail what was happening since we couldn’t look away.\n\nThe first three days were good. But, something strange happened on the fourth day. The boat moved. I didn’t think much of it, while my co-worker told me that I shouldn’t be so lenient about it.\n\nWe did what we usually did. Kept an eye on the boat and trained the dogs. But, I saw a shadow move behind the boat.\n\nNow, we had to walk backwards to get to the house, till we touched the door. And make sure all the dogs were inside by 10:59 P.M., and couldn’t go out till 4:59 A.M. They have 14 dachshunds. So, we barely made it occasionally.\n\nBut, as I was saying, there was a shadow behind the boat, and it moved. I asked my colleague to check it out. One of the dogs was near the boat and got a scratch. It wasn’t a big one, but I worried more than I should’ve.\n\nThe fourth day was creepy. But, today, five was even worse. I let my guard down. I let one of the puppies get near the boat. There was a huge scratch along her back. It wasn’t deep, but it was bigger than the day prior.\n\nWe made sure she was alright. Which was my fatal mistake. I walked to my colleague, who was across the yard. I quickly looked at the boat again. There was a tall figure by it. It was tall, a pale color, and I couldn’t see his face. There were two fishing rods stuck on his hand. I yelled to my co-worker to get the dogs inside as I ran to the house while getting their attention. \n\nYou can’t outrun him. He has accurate aim and he got me at the back of my shirt. My colleague got the dogs inside but tried to rescue me. And that was her fatal mistake.\n\nWe were both reeled in like fish. Instead of letting us go, he tossed us in the boat. The figure soon put the boat in its original spot, as all of her bones were crushed during transportation. I was lucky enough to get out, with only my legs and arms harmed.\n\nI saw the family come to the backyard when they returned. They didn’t bother to check inside the boat. Instead, they smiled crookedly. And, they left me in the yard.\n\nIf you find a house with a boat in the back yard, keep an eye on it until it’s out if site. Unless you want the same fate as I did. Or worse.",

        "text": "I showed up to Ethan’s mom house to find Lauren sitting on the front porch waiting for me.\n\n“Lauren… how are you?” I asked with genuine concern.\n\n“I’m fine. I honestly have no idea how this all spiraled so out of control.” She shook her head. “I took a brief girls trip and by the time I came back Ethan was,” she held up her hands as if to say she had no idea. “He was in jail! Like, how?”\n\n“He said he stabbed you. What happened between you two?” I asked.\n\nShe looked shocked. “Stabbed me!? He gave me a hug goodbye and said he was going to have his own boys night and made some corny joke about Jack Daniels being the other guy. He didn’t hurt me, not at all.”\n\n“I don’t know how to tell you this but, there was blood in your house.” I tried to spare her the detail of just how much blood.\n\n“I know. It was there when I got home so I called Ethan’s cellphone and his mom picked up and told me everything. I hired cleaners but I’m staying here for a while.”\n\nWe talked for a short while longer. She told me how she and Ethan had no problems, he had no history of mental illness or blackouts, and she has no idea why he would say that he stabbed her.\n\nSadly it would still be weeks before we ever got the blood results back. But for now, we have no victim… dead or alive. \n\nEthan could have slaughtered a pig for all we know. But for now, we had enough to get him out of jail. \n\nHe came over to his mom’s house once he was released and after a long embrace with Lauren, I headed to the front porch to talk with Ethan once more. \n\n“Ethan, what happened man?”\n\nHe bent over and rested his hair in his palms. “I wish I knew.”\n\nHe repeated to me the same story he told me earlier. He thought someone broke into his house to kill him and it kept jumping between Lauren’s face to someone, or something, else. \n\nWe won’t know for a few weeks, or perhaps months, whose blood was in that house. And even then, if the DNA isn’t in our system then it will remain unknown. There’s no crime for holding a knife in your own house though, right?\n\nI don’t know what the hell went on that night but Ethan only had one final thing to say to me. Gathering his thoughts he said, “Just take a look at your essay. It’s stuck with me all these years.”\n\nSo I walked out to my truck, grabbed my essay, and we sat together watching the rain roll in on the chilled January night. \n\n*It happens to everyone, just in different ways. Some of us will simply experience deja vu as we eat our morning cereal while others will experience life-changing phenomena, but we all will experience an echo at some ping or another.\n\nIn 1842, Julius Robert Mayer discovered the Law of Preservation of Energy. More simply put- energy can neither be created nor destroyed.\n\nE=mc^2\n\n Albert Einstein discovered that mass and energy are interchangeable. This means that everything- including humans- are energy stored in mass particle form. Therefore, humans may neither be created nor destroyed. So where does our energy go when our hearts stop pumping red fuel throughout our veins?\n\nIt’s simple really, we become a higher existence of energy. Much like a potato has the ability to light a bulb, in the right environment, we have the ability to light a room as well.\n\nEchoes are generally harmless as they are simply residual energy. I say generally, because at times, there can be a glitch. Think about your grandmother’s favorite lamp. It has hand painted flowers wrapped around a glass base. You have to find classic incandescent bulbs since it won’t even work with fluorescent. When you reach for the cord it’s a creamy eggshell color, although at one time it was white. As you turn the dial to click on, you have to stop at precisely the right click or else it shuts right back off if you flip it too far.\n\nSure, this lamp is well loved and beautiful n I doubt, but it only survives and lasts under the most precise conditions. The right bulb, the right flick of a switch. But one day, even as you do everything right, the bulb blows a fuse and poof- it’s broken.\n\nSometimes our world has a glitch. Maybe we didn’t use the right bulb that day or we neglected to turn the switch just right. That’s when you can hear the voice whispering softly into your ear that something is wrong and you need to follow your true path.\n\nMy mom had a friend who almost went to college but instead she became a hair dresser. Everyone gave her such a hard time but all she could say was that she did what she knew she was meant to do. Sure, people thought she was a hippy or took an easy way out, but when she became a six figure hair dressed with the perfect husband and kids meanwhile their other friend went to college only to wind up divorced and an alcoholic- who’s to say we can’t hear our own paths?\n\nThere is another type of glitch, though. One more sinister. Sometimes we listen just perfectly and we do everything exactly to plan, but a fuse is still blown. Maybe there was a leak in the electric box out of our control, or a storm came through. These glitches are unpredictable and can manifest echoes.\n\nUnexplained phenomena such as UFOs, Moms magically lifting cars, or even perfectly sane people committing murder, are a result of this life as we know it counteracting a glitch in the parallel. It’s when deja vu hits the hardest.\n\nBut sometimes our déjà vu moments can be echos. Echos of history, echos of energy, or even echos of vibration. Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, so where does it go? It’s in a loop. And sometimes, those loops crinkle like a garden hose.\n\nI’ve seen it happen, you know. Well, not yet, but I know I will one day. And I’ll use this essay to prove it.*",

        "text": "I passed by the old cemetery today. God, the fact that it's still there is enough to make me shudder. It's all there.\n\nIf you're reading this, there's a chance you might be my son. If that's the case, then I have three things to say to you. First is that I'm truly sorry for what you're about to read. Your old man isn't the hero you think he is, nor was he a good man back in the day. I need you to know that I am in no way, shape, or form proud of what I'm about to tell you about. If it were possible to get a do-over, you best damn believe I would.\n\nIf you're anybody else, then while I would tell you the same thing, I could really care less as much about what you wanna make of me once this is all over with. Bottom line, son or no, understand both that I've made a lot of wrong decisions in my life, that they've come back to haunt me, that I can no longer live with them, and that... Well...\n\nI know exactly where I'm going...\n\nI was 17, about to be 18 when all of this was first put into motion. About as old as you are now, Noah. I  walked home from school every day, and the cemetery sat right along the outer edge. Hallowed Stone, \"Place of peaceful rest\". That's what the sign was supposed to say. Over them, though, were the words *\"We are The End\"*, spraypainted in yellow letters. Those words may as damn well have been what was engraved into the sign anyway, though. Would've made a lot more sense -- anybody that had been laid in those grounds is anything *but* \"peaceful\".\n\nWhatever \"peace\" that'd been had in that place died years before, with the first girl. 17-year-old, Samantha Reynolds, found buried in a shallow grave after apparently been Y-sectioned and relieved of all her internal organs. She'd been missing for almost three weeks by the time they'd found her. The neighborhood and the city as a whole went into an uproar. Every night for at least the next month and a half after that, I remember seeing constant reports of the manhunt for Samantha's killer until finally, attention was detracted from her at the discovery of another missing person.\n\nThis time it was a 12 year old boy, Levi Edmunson, supposedly nabbed on his way from school. Just like Samantha before him, panic ensued until he, too, was found flayed alive and buried in a shallow grave. Then, before the media would even have a chance to really catch wind of any of this, another little boy went missing, then an adult woman, and so on and so forth. Each time, too, you guessed it, each and every one of them were found the exact same way Samantha was. They became more and more frequent an occurrence, too, with new bodies being found just about every other day for the next three months.\n\nI can also remember the watch parties that were formed because of what was going on. My own folks -- your grandma and grandpa, Noah, even took part in it at one point, taking shifts standing at the gates at nighttime one some weekends. No matter what, though, no one, either guarding Hallowed Stone itself, or whether they were one of the countless groups that decided to make rounds around the neighborhood, could find who it was or keep people from disappearing. Everything went straight to Hell, though, when it was the pastor's daughter that disappeared. Her case was special for a couple reasons.\n\nThe first was that she, unlike the former victims, wasn't nabbed off the street anywhere. No, she was abducted, straight from her house. The other thing was that, not only was she in her house, but she wasn't alone. She was supposedly throwing a slumber party or something with two or three other friends when they got her. At least one of the other two were killed and the other was in critical condition when they found her, but she was alive. That was the first time anyone was able to get a lead on the guy doing it, described as a tall, young looking guy, thin, with pale skin and pitch black eyes. She said he moved so quickly that she couldn't ever tell where he was until he was right up on her.\n\nPeople searched for this guy and the daughter for over a year, with the body count continuing to pile up. Neither, however were ever found, which was also the biggest difference in this particular case. She was, for whatever reason, the only one that *wasn't* found in the cemetery. The killer himself was named by the evening news as \"The Demon of Hallowed Stone\". By that point, though, people in the neighborhood were more than content to just move out. By the Summertime, there was hardly a third of the residents that lived there from before. That, of course, meant that there was hardly anyone to really hang out with, which led me to wanting to spend time in the cemetery.\n\nNow, understand that it was mostly so I could visit my aunt. I wasn't one of those punks you hear about that liked to sacrifice animals or do stupid shit like that in graveyards. Again, I was just lonely, and I missed my aunt. So, there I was, just trying to sit by her gravesite when I remember hearing a rustling noise coming from the trees of the nearby woods that surrounded it. I looked up and saw nothing at first. The second I turned away, though, I heard it.\n\n*\"Come with us, Hank...\"*\n\nFrom the way it sounded, I couldn't tell where the hell it was coming from.\n\n*\"Hank... Come with us...\"*\n\n*\"Join us all, Hank. Join us in the...\"*\n\n\"Hank!\" My head snapped back to the gate. Standing there was momma. \"Get your tail outta there right now!\" I did a quick double-take between her and the forest before running over to her. She snatched me by my hand and dragged me to the car. \"You mind telling me just what in God's name you were doing in there?!\"\n\n\"I was just sitting with Aunt Rosa, Mom.\" I remember replying sulkily.\n\n\"In there?!\" she shrieked, \"For God's sake, Hank, do you not pay any fucking attention?\"\n\n\"Mom, I was just fine, I do this all the ti--\"\n\n\"The hell you do!\" I stopped trying to argue then. That was twice she'd cursed at me in a conversation; a tell-tale sign with that woman that it was best for my future that I just shut the hell up and say \"Yes ma'am\" and roll with the punches. She told me to get in the car and she sped us the rest of the way home. That whole thing ended with me being told that I was grounded for two weeks and that I was no longer allowed to walk home from school. I'd have to take the bus from now on, which sucked because the kids were obnoxious morons. The rest of that night had my mind divided with two big questions.\n\nFirst, of course was just how much was I about to hear it from my old man when he got home, you know how that goes, but second, funny enough, was wondering if Momma hadn't just saved me. I started to think of the voices themselves. Particularly at how many there seemed to be. I could hear the voice of both a man and a woman, soft and almost one with the wind. With this, I wondered, *had* I actually heard people whispering at all?\n\nIt wouldn't have been *that* far fetched if I was just imagining it, right? All alone in a quiet cemetery, never even mind the fact that it was place like \"Hallowed Stone\", with it being as windy as it was, AND the fact that Momma had been calling out to me. Could that have been it, then, could I have just been misinterpreting Momma's voice for something else?\n\nEither way, both questions would be answered. The first one was almost immediately when I heard the old station wagon pull into the driveway and he came in. Ironically, I feel like *he* heard it from her more than I had because for about 5 minutes, I heard the two sort of shouting at each other. I couldn't tell whether they were actually *angry* with each other or what. I just pulled the blankets over my head until everything went quiet again. For a moment, all was still until I heard a light knock on the door.\n\n\"Come in.\" The door opened slowly and in stepped my old man. I sighed and said, \"Hey Dad.\"\n\nHe sighed and said, \"Hey there, buddy.\" There was another brief moment of silence that weighed down the air in the room. We both looked at each other with the same awkward expression. \"So... Do anything fun today?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Not really, unless you'd count being bawled out by Momma.\" He sighed again.\n\n\"Yeah, so I hear.\" He sat down on my bed. \"I know you miss your aunt. I do, too, trust me. If it were anywhere else and circumstances were different, I wouldn't have a single care in the world if you wanted to go see her every day from dusk to dawn, but your mother has a point. It ain't safe.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. Not because I was mad at him, of course, but because, liked it or not, I knew he was right. They both were, essentially. As well as this, though, this also had me thinking about the whispers back in the cemetery again.\n\nWas I actually hearing someone calling out to me from the woods? For what purpose?\n\nDad patted me on the back and said, \"I love you, son. You know you can talk to me if you need to, right?\" I nodded and he left. I laid back in my bed. The house was quiet after that for a while, and that was when I heard it again, coming from the back of my mind, or at least, that's what I thought.\n\n*\"Hank... He's waiting for you...\"*\n\nIt was distant at first. Deep and trancelike, too. Then it came closer and lighter, sounding more like a woman's voice.\n\n*\"He waits for you, just like the rest of us...\"*\n\nCloser and closer, coming from all around me in my room, it felt like. More voices joined in, all repeating more or less the same phrase; men, women, and even *children*, I noticed. None stood out to me, though, more than one in particular.\n\n*\"Come back, Hank. We're waiting for you. I'm waiting for you. Come back to the cemetery.\"*\n\n*Aunt Rosa?*\n\nI shot upright in my bed and swung my head everywhere, breathing heavily. Nothing. An empty, dark, quiet room. I hesitated for a second before getting up and going to my window. Now, this next part is, in a very screwed up sort of way, kind of funny, if only in a morbid way. I was more than half expecting to see absolutely nothing outside my window except the parked cars in the driveway, blanketed by the night sky. A sort of wishful thinking, you could say.\n\nIn that vein, it just seems a little \"funny\" to me, I guess, that, seeing two hooded figures standing outside the house, focusing their gazes right up at my bedroom window, like they were expecting me, that this caused me to instantly seize with terror. One of them, I saw, was staring up at the window with these unnatural red, slitted, sort of snake looking eyes that pierced through the darkness. It was the only feature I could distinguish from either of them. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I thought about running to Momma and Dad, but then I wondered what would happen then? This belief was then solidified when, after rapidly blinking a few hundred or so odd times, they were gone.\n\n*Huh?* I rubbed my eyes. They weren't there anymore. There was absolutely no sign of them, where they'd gone, or that they'd even been standing there at all. Then again, *had* they been standing there? The question of how much of this wasn't just my head popping a few screws loose on me returned. Just like before in Hallowed Stone, as well as a few seconds ago for that matter, I couldn't help but start to think that this was all just my overall loneliness and want for my Aunt Rosa acting out through my subconscious or something like that. Something psychological, you know?\n\n\"Psychological\" or not, though, I was scared shitless all the same, not helped by the return of the whispers. I couldn't see anybody, in or outside of the room or the house, who was doing it, but they were there, somewhere, goading me back to Hallowed Stone. That night, I spent in my room, declining to even come out for supper, something I only ever did when I was either sick or *extremely* tired and fell asleep early from an all-night study binge (That's right, Noah, your old man used to actually have a bit of book smarts, too). I'm sure this raised concerns with my folks, but fortunately, I guess they either weren't in the mood to talk to me, or they just knew I wasn't *actually* going to tell them and they decided they'd rather save their breath over a bullshit answer. Can't say I blame them.\n\nAll that night, I could hear them, faint and distant, but there. It wouldn't be until that next morning, around maybe 4 or 5:00, give or take, that I could *actually* get any kind of sleep when they all suddenly just dissipated. Just like the figures standing in the driveway just \"Dissipated\". Vanishing into thin air.\n\n*Like they were never there at all.*\n\nI was lucky, though, that the next day was Saturday, so it's not like I had to actually wake up for anything. It was almost Noon when I did wake up for the day. Also funny, I guess, was the fact that I had absolutely no memory at first of what'd happened the previous night. I remembered the incident in the cemetery, sure, but as far what I saw or experienced in my room afterwards, there was nothing. Well, except for maybe Aunt Rosa's voice as well, which still just faintly rang in my ears, *\"We're waiting for you, Hankie...\"*\n\nI went into the kitchen for breakfast. Momma was in the middle of cracking the eggs for the standard \"breakfast O' champions\" for every Saturday morning in my house, growing up: Six-egg omelets, sausage patties, and homemade waffles with a glass of sweet tea. I sat down at the table and started pouring myself a glass of sweet tea when Momma turned around and asked, \"How'd you sleep?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Alright, I guess.\" She nodded. The look on her face gave it away that something was up, that there was something she was alluding to. She continued cooking the eggs while I looked outside of the window at her right. It looked as peaceful as ever, and yet, for some reason, that gave it a sort of foreboding feeling to me. I looked back to Momma. Her face was chiseled in a mixed state of worry and concentration.\n\n\"I-Is something wrong, Momma?\" I asked. She didn't say anything at first, so I asked again. This time, she glanced at me and then back to the pan. \"I do something wrong?\"\n\nShe sighed. \"We'll talk in a moment, Hank. Let's at least get breakfast down us first, eh?\"\n\n\"O-Okay...\" I went back to my glass of tea. Dad walked in only a couple seconds later and asked her something about \"Have you heard anything more about it yet?\" or something like that, to which I, of course, asked, \"About what?\" Momma then glared at Dad, darting her eyes back and forth between me and him.\n\nHe looked at me and awkwardly went \"Oh...\", inhaling sharply.\n\n\"Like I said, we'll talk about it in a minute, okay? Breakfast is almost ready, come sit down.\" Dad sat at his end of the table while Momma plated the food and set the table. We said grace and for about a solid five or so minutes after that, the three of us ate in complete silence. In that time, I watched Dad and Momma pass awkward glances between themselves and me. Finally, I sat down my fork and asked what was going on.\n\nDad sighed and replied, \"Son, when you were in Hallowed Stone last night, did you maybe see somebody? Talk to anybody?\" I shook my head. \"You sure?\"\n\n\"Sweetie, it's okay, I won't be mad.\" Momma chimed in, \"But we need to know.\"\n\n\"No, I promise. I was just visiting Aunt Rosa's grave like I had been.\" I looked at them. They looked skeptically back at me. \"What? Did something happen?\"\n\n\"Well, somebody was here last night, in the neighborhood and at the house.\" My eyes swelled.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"Yeah, the uh...\" He paused, squinting and snapping his fingers, \"Reynold's boy up the street went missing late last night.\"\n\n\"T-Trey?\" I shuddered. \"Trey Reynolds?\" He nodded. \"When? how?\" He shrugged.\n\n\"That's not all, though.\" Momma said. \"Someone was here last night.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" She looked over to the door that led to the garage.\n\n\"This morning, your father and I found your name spraypainted on the car.\" That was when my heart stopped beating altogether. My body was a statue, fixed upright and perfectly still in my chair. \"That's why we need to know, Hank, if you were talking to anybody, anybody at all, in the cemetery last night.\"\n\nI looked her dead in the face and, mustering every bit of strength I could, I declared as sincerely as I could that I hadn't said anything to anyone in Hallowed Stone that night. I could tell from the looks on their faces that they weren't *entirely* convinced. \"Momma, I *promise*\\-- no, I *swear,* I WASN'T talking to anybody in the cemetery last night!\"\n\n\"What about any of the other times you mentioned?\" asked Dad.\n\n\"No. I told you, I only ever went alone and I never spoke to anyone.\"\n\n\"And no one's ever tried to talk to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You notice if anyone's been following you?\" I shook my head. Looking back, I think I might've actually started making myself dizzy from how much I'd been shaking it. That, and just how frantically my fucking heart thundered in my chest. My thoughts were in a cyclone, with every worst imaginable scenario playing out simultaneously, all flashing in my head.\n\nI imagined the figures in the driveway from last night, staring up at me. Waving at me. Goading me.\n\n*\"Come join us, Hank...\"*\n\n*\"He's waiting for you, Hank.\"*\n\n*\"We're all waiting for you, Hank...\"*\n\nI thought of Aunt Rosa's voice again. Why did it sound like her? It couldn't actually *be her*, could it?\n\nMy thoughts then further derailed, thinking about Trey. Now, Trey was known to sneak out at night sometimes. Especially if there was a party being talked about at school that weekend at somebody's house -- which there was. So, okay, yeah, that *could've* explained that, except then why hadn't he returned home?\n\nIf you're not my son reading this, you're probably thinking he just got too wasted to walk back home again, right? I would have agreed with you, except then how could he have been taken?\n\n\"Trey, are you sure he's missing? I mean, there *was* a party last night and--\"\n\n\"We know, and so did his folks.\" Dad said. \"The Satton's house, right?\" I nervously nodded my head. \"Yeah, folks said he'd already called and said he was comin' home about two or three hours before they reported him.\"\n\n\"Have the cops been called? Has anything been found?\"\n\nHe sighed and replied, \"Yeah, but they won't really be able to do anything until tonight, when he'll have been gone for a full 24 hours.\" He let out a dry laugh. I could feel myself starting to hyperventilate. Dots started connecting and the world began to spin.\n\n*Last night... but that was also when...*\n\nI looked to the door to the driveway. It didn't take a genius to realize that they must've nabbed him before or after they came to my house. They either had to have seen him walking by, as his house was close by to mine, or them being there must have been a message to me, sort of a fucked up \"We got one of your little friends, Ha, Ha\" type of thing.\n\n*\"We're waiting for you, Hank...\"*\n\n\"Hank? Hank?\" Dad's voice faintly cut through the Halestorm that was my mind. I felt him start to shake me, \"Hank!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I looked back to him and Momma, startled. They matched my look of confusion and anxiety with ones of growing concern. \"You okay, bud?\"\n\n\"Um... Y-yeah... Yeah, I...\" I was interrupted by a knock at the front door. The three of us at once snapped our heads in the direction of the front door. We all exchanged glances at one another before Dad got up and went to the door.\n\nA couple seconds later, I heard Dad call out to the kitchen, \"Hank, It's for you.\" I hesitated for a second before slowly standing up and trudging Zombie-like to the living room. Dad stood in the doorway, in front of my friend, Nolan Peters.\n\n\"Hey dude!\" he exclaimed. \"Wanted to see if you could hang out for a bit.\" I looked at Dad.\n\n\"Oh... Well, I mean, I'd *like* to, but I'm kinda grounde--\"\n\n\"Oh go on.*\"* Dad said, grinning sightly. I looked at him, eyebrows raised. \"Go on, have fun.\"\n\n\"B-But what about--\" He waved his hand.\n\n\"It's fine, I'll handle that, you just go and have fun, buddy.\" I grinned and went to the door. before reaching the door, though, Dad stopped me by softly taking my arm and said \"Just stay away from Hallowed Stone, okay?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" He winked and let me go and me and Nolan bolted out across the yard. We were halfway down the road leading away from the house before we slowed down.\n\n\"So, what've you been up to?\" asked Nolan.\n\n\"Nothing, really.\"\n\n\"Hey, so, what were you about to tell me earlier at the door, anyway? Something about you being grounded?\" I looked at him.\n\n\"Yeah, what about it?\"\n\n\"Well what for?\" I scoffed.\n\n\"It was nothing, dude. Momma got pissed at me when she found me in the cemetery.\"\n\n\"You were in Hallowed Stone?\" he asked, sounding for some reason genuinely confused.\n\n\"Yeah, and? Dude, I'm *always* there.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Dude, what the heck, you never brought me along?\" He delivered a slight, playful punch to my shoulder. I just stared confused back at him.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, I mean, what if you saw the Black-eyed man the cops have been lookin' for?\" My heart started to quicken, though I kept walking, not wanting to let it show.\n\n\"Okay, and?\"\n\n\"And you would've caught all that *without ME*, your best buddy?\" I was given another playful punch in the shoulder for this, this one albeit noticeably harder than the last.\n\n\"*Sor-ry,\"* I replied sarcastically, \"If it makes you feel any better, I haven't seen any \"Black-eyed people\" or anything like that.\" I paused for a second.\n\n*At least not while I was IN the cemetery...*\n\n\"I've just been visiting my Aunt Rosa. She was buried there.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, I remember that now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well anyway, Momma caught me out there last night and was PISSED, so I was--\"\n\n\"Hey, you hear about Trey last night?\" I paused again. The shiver was a bit more noticeable this time when it traveled up my back.\n\n\"Y-Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"I was actually *at* that party last night, man.\" he exclaimed. \"I saw him there, too. I remember seeing him leave when I was.\"\n\n\"Where did you see him go?\"\n\n\"Back toward his house, why?\" I didn't answer. The feeling was eating away at me more and more. Trey's house was just a little way down the neighborhood from my house, and only a few feet from Hallowed Stone itself. I realized in my head that, if my prediction of events was right, it would've been nothing at all for the \"Black-eyed man\" and who or whatever the hell else was with him to snatch Trey, drag him away to God only knew where, and then be there at my house like they were.\n\n\"What time?\" I asked shakily.\n\n\"Uh... I-I don't know, maybe like...\" He grimaced, rubbing his forehead and inhaling sharply. \"Maybe like, 12, 1:00, something like that, why?\" I shook, remaining silent. I saw him look over at me. \"Dude, are you okay? You look like you're about to have a heart attack.\"\n\nI looked at him. I didn't know what to tell him. He was my friend, sure, but I didn't feel like telling him what I saw last night was a good idea. I didn't want to lie to him -- I don't like lying to *anyboody* \\-- but I had the bad feeling that if I did tell him, especially given his reaction earlier when I told him about how I'd visit my aunt there in Hallowed Stone on a regular basis, \"without him\", that he'd try and talk me into going there on some search for the \"Back-eyed man\" or something. \"I-I'm fine, it's--\"\n\n*\"Hank!\"*\n\nI swung my head around behind me. It sounded like whoever it was was hurt or running from something, crying for help. I couldn't see anybody, though. \"Hank?\" Nolan asked, \"You okay?\" I didn't answer.\n\n*\"Hank! I need you!\"*\n\n*What the hell?* I thought, swinging my head now in the other direction. Again, no one there. I began to feel Nolan nudge my arm. \"D-Dude?\"\n\nI lightly batted his hand away, sighing, and said, \"Yeah, yeah, dude, I-I'm fine, just...\" My eyes opened to see Nolan frozen in place, face white as a sheet, staring at the space to my right. \"You okay?\" I asked. This time, *he* was the one that didn't answer. I slowly turned around to see, to my utter terror, three hooded figures standing on the other side of the street across from us.\n\nFor a moment, the five of us stood, staring at one another. Suddenly, the one in the middle raised their arm and pointed at me. My heart pounded harder and harder at this. *Why is he pointing at me?!*\n\n*\"Hank, come with us.\"* From the corner of my eye, I saw Nolan turn and look at me.\n\nI could hear the woman's voice from before say, *\"Hank, we need you!\"*\n\n\"Dude, do you know them?\" I looked at Nolan. He could hear them, too. I shook my head and looked back to the figures. The figure in the middle took two steps toward us, hand still outstretched. I saw his hand turn over into a gesture like he wanted something.\n\n*\"Take my hand, child.\"* I heard in the deep voice. I backed away, seeing him continue toward me.\n\n\"Wh-Who are you?\" I managed to stutter out. He stopped, about midway into the road in between the other sidewalk where the others were and my side with me and Nolan.\n\n*\"Take my hand, Hank.\"* he said, his arm somehow seeming to stretch further and further out toward me, despite his body not moving at all. My eyes darted back and forth between Nolan and the other two figures. *\"Take my hand, join us, Hank. He waits for you.\"*\n\n\"Wh-Who?\" This was when he started taking steps toward me again, and I started backing away again.\n\n*\"He waits for you, Hank. He waits to be completed. He will have us all.\"*\n\n\"Who? What the hell are you talking about?\" Nolan exclaimed, stepping in front of me. The figure turned to face him, dropping his hand. \"Look, whoever you and your little group of weirdos are, just go away and--\"\n\nHe got no further when the figure then removed his hood and revealed himself to be a bald man with gaunt, ghostly white skin and two marbled eyes sunken in their sockets. Nolan and I both instantly went breathless in fear. A smile stretched across the man's face, spreading so unnaturally wide that I'd sworn I could see the skin actually tear itself wider and wider across his cheeks, exposing black, diseased looking gums and jagged, shark-like teeth.\n\nHis arm raised again and his eyes refocused to me. \"Come, Hank, It's time to join us.\" His voice was somehow amplified with the removal of his hood. I felt a growing surge kicking through my legs to take off behind me, but for some reason, I couldn't move. My body was telling me to run like Hell, but my mind was telling me to stay put. He crept further forward.",

        "text": " \n\nThe road crew was coming back in for the day. Those are the inmates that are allowed to go out pick up trash, cut grass, or any other kind of menial task the government wants done for free. When I was first hired as a correctional officer, I was surprised to learn that most of the inmates loved being on the road crew. Kitchen was boring. Being a rock man, or custodian was under too much supervision. The road crew was the top of the line. The officers that drove the trucks had the most seniority and they were the most lenient. They were coasting towards retirement. You could kill another inmate as long as they didn’t have to do the paperwork. It was as close to freedom as these inmates were going to get in a while. They would scour the grounds for half-smoked cigarettes and if they found any, the officers didn’t mind letting them smoke, even though it was forbidden. What could it hurt? The one thing they couldn’t do is to bring any of that nonsense back to the facility. \n\nI worked at the Thompson correctional facility on Evergreen Drive. It was a medium security facility. These inmates were 11/29’ers or prisoners convicted of misdemeanors. They weren’t your rapists and murderers. They could still contribute to society if they turned it around and a good deal of them were likeable fellas. In most cases, they behaved because they didn’t want to lose their current sentencing and get sent state-side or to the penitentiary. This was especially true of the road crew. It was a gravy job and no inmate wanted to ruin that. \n\nWhen their shift was over and they were done for the day, those inmates had to be processed back into the facility. They had to be counted and strip-searched. I absolutely hated the strip-search. We usually processed them through one of the four solitary confinement cells that were out in front of pods A and B. You’d close the door and they would hand you their clothing one by one, starting with the shoes. You’d pull out the soles of the shoes and check the bottoms. Then you’d pull the socks inside out and shake them. Same for the rest of their clothing, including their nasty sweaty underwear, which I never touched. I’d have them do it for me. Finally, I’d give me that last humiliating command: “Squat and cough,” like some projectile was going to just shoot out their rear-end. I would give the command but I never had any intentions of taking a closer look. If they wanted whatever they shoved up there that bad, then they could have it. Some guards had a saying, “In your ass, it’s a pass.” And I never had any issues with that until Charlie. \n\nCharlie was a smaller inmate. I think he was barely over five feet. He was mousey and very shy. You could tell he wasn’t a very smart man and he was mentally incapable of taking care of himself. You see enough inmates to know when someone really did not belong there. He wasn’t a criminal. He was a child. I always felt kind of sorry for him. He was destined to be a failure, to lose, to only achieve a certain level of sustainability in life, if even that. There were no Aces in the hole for him. He needed help. None of the other inmates messed with him though. He just didn’t have any friends. He was pitifully lonely. \n\nCharlie was a good worker and the road crew officers liked having him around. I think they felt sorry for him too and would let him sit up front in the truck with them. None of the other officers I spoke with knew what he was in for. If you liked an inmate, you didn’t bother looking up his record. I figure whatever he did it couldn’t have been that bad if it was a misdemeanor. \n\nIt was mid-August and the inmates were especially rank. Four of us officers were processing a hundred or so inmates. I saw that Charlie was next in line. I was half-heartedly going through these searches. I was just ready to get it over with. \n\n“Next.”\n\n“Hey Officer Gatlin.”\n\n“Hey Charlie. How was it out there?”\n\n“Nice, but hot.” \n\n“Yeah, it smells like it.”\n\nCharlie chuckled, but would not look up. He never looked up. I never really looked into his eyes. I searched through all his clothes and there was nothing unusual.\n\n“Alright, Charlie, squat and cough for me.”\n\nAt this point I usually don’t even pay attention. I turn my head and listen for the cough. When I hear the cough, I tell them to get dress and go to their pod. This time was different. For the first time in my career, something fell out and hit the floor. It sounded like a coin and I could hear it wobble before it came to a standstill. I looked down to see a bronze coin about the size of a silver dollar. Engraved on it was a woman dressed like a Greek Goddess in a toga holding a skull in one hand and a snake in the other. The snake was biting her in the arm and blood was trickling down and pooling around her feet. I surprised myself how close I had move to see what was on the coin. It had grabbed my attention and I was focused on the coin until I noticed how ridiculous Charlie looked. Naked and crouched down like a humanoid bird laying an egg. \n\n“Are you kidding me!!! What in the world are you thinking?”\n\n“I’m sorry Officer Gatlin. I saw it on the side of the road. It’s so pretty.”\n\n“You know we can’t allow this. I’ll get in trouble. You’ll get in trouble.”\n\n“Please. I need it. It’s good luck. It will protect me in here.” \n\nI shouldn’t have done it but I let him have it. I figured it would be like a fidget toy or something and soothe his anxiety a bit. \n\n“You can have it but you can’t let any other inmate see it or find it. You better not talk about it to anyone, even another officer. Is that understood?”\n\n“Yes sir. Thank you. Thank you very much,” he said and I although I couldn’t see his entire face, I could tell he was smiling. \n\nLieutenant Adams asked me to work a double that night. I agreed. What else was I going to do and plus I needed the money. It’s an easy gig. Most of the inmates are asleep on third shift.  This was physically the easiest job I ever had. You made a round every hour and recorded the time in your log. Simple, of course until some mayhem went down.\n\nIt was still second shift when I discovered Charlie in the bathroom. It was just after dinner and we had already collected the trays. Charlie had brought his tray into the bathroom and chunked into the trash. He was at the sink washing his new coin. \n\nWhat are you doing? I told you not to have that out in the open and why did you throw your dinner tray in the trash?”\n\nHe didn’t respond. He didn’t even look up from washing his coin. He just ignored me and I hate that more than anything. I’d rather be cussed than ignored. \n\n“Alright, give me that damn coin.”\n\nI snatched the coin from his hand and put it in my pocket. He looked up with a sullen and angry face, an unrecognizable face. He looked different. He walked toward me and put his hand in my pocket. I was caught off guard. You should never let an inmate get that close to you but it was Charlie. I didn’t expect his brashness. I let him have the coin but decided I was going to blast him with pepper spray to teach him a lesson. I grabbed my spray in one smooth fast motion. This was the first time I had ever used it and I admit I was looking forward to it. We could do this thing in the bathroom and no one would say anything. It wouldn’t hurt Charlie that much and he was too timid to tell anyone. I could run the showers to dissipate the spray like the inmates did to get rid of the smoke smell from their cigarettes. I pushed down the nozzle and gave him a healthy blast to the eyes, but he just stood there eyes wide open. Now I was forced to keep spraying. If this wasn’t effective, he would never be intimidated by it and I might have to resort to other not-so-friendly procedures.\n\nHe never blinked and I never stopped spraying until the bottle was empty. We stood there looking at each other, neither one making a move. I was thinking about what I should do next but I was kind of stuck. I couldn’t call the other officers with the pungent spray still lingering in the air and him flashing his shiny new toy. They would know that I had used my pepper spray and would want to know why. Charlie would throw me under the bus and tell them that I had let him have the coin, but worst of all they would know that this small pitiful man had got the best of me. \n\n“Just put that coin away when you’re done washing it!!” \n\nThe rest of second shift was uneventful. I did several more rounds. Charlie was laying in his bunk staring at the ceiling with his right hand in his pocket rubbing what I knew to be the coin. He never moved or took his hand out of his pocket. \n\nThird shift was lights out. The inmates cleaned up the recreation room, had their showers, and went to bed. I was a pretty lenient officer. If any of the inmates weren’t ready for bed and they still wanted to talk, I would let them go to the bathroom and hang out there as long as they were quiet. I would bend the rules if they were willing to work with me. I did my first several rounds of third shift and everything was quiet. There was no one in the bathroom. I guess everyone was too tired to stay up later than usual and I was glad. I always worried that one of the other inmates might start complaining about the noise and then I would have to contend with some drama and the accusations of favoritism.\n\nAt one in the morning, I did another round. To do a round you have to walk from the guard station and into the recreation room which is a separate room in front of the living quarters where all the bunks were. At one side of the living quarters was the bathroom and showers. I would usually go first into the bathroom then walk around the bunks. This time though I was curious about Charlie. I was getting nervous about him filing a complaint about the spray and I wanted to invite him into the restroom. I was going to apologize but he wasn’t at his bunk. I decided that he must already be in the bathroom and I would have a chance to talk to him. \n\nI went through the door of the bathroom and I could hear one of the showers running. I walked past the toilets and to the last shower stall. Charlie was sitting on the floor, legs spread out and blood all around him. He was naked and chewing on his left ring finger. Laying on the ground in between his legs were two of his fingers he had already gnawed off from his hand and next to his detached fingers was the coin. I noticed that any blood that touched the coin seemed to be immediately absorbed. \n\n“Squat and cough Officer Gatlin,” he said and then started laughing, flashing his blood-stained teeth. He held his hand high and I could see that a new greenish finger was growing in place of his missing index finger. He smiled and chomped down on his ring finger, swinging his head from side-to-side like a dog trying to dislodge a piece of meat from the bone. I heard the bone snap and he pulled away his head tearing one last string of flesh away and spitting his finger to the ground. \n\n“Code Red! Code Red!,” yelling without realizing I hadn’t even grabbed my radio yet. \n\nI ran out of the bathroom and fumbled for my radio. When I got to the recreation room Officer Devon in the pod across the hall had already heard me. He had pulled his radio out and was calling for a Code Red. I could see that other officers were entering my pod. \n\n“Gatlin, where is the code.”\n\n“In the bathroom!”\n\n“Then why are you out here,” screamed Officer Devon. \n\nI turned and followed the other officers into the bathroom and already they were calling for the restraint chair. \n\n“Charlie is hurting himself. Get that damn chair up here now,” I could hear another officer yelling. I was frozen at first. Two of the other officers had grabbed him by the legs and were dragging him away from the running water. Charlie lunged at Officer Devon and bit into his forearm. Devon screamed and starting punching Charlie in the face. Lieutenant Adams came running into the bathroom and pulled Devon away. I finally jumped in and grabbed Charlie by his wrist. By that time enough officers were on top of him. The put the spit mask over his head and shoved him in the chair, restraining his hands and feet. All this time Charlie was laughing. \n\nWe all stepped away to gather our senses. It was a collective shock. We were trying to get a mental grasp of what was happening. We heard an unrecognizable sound but then again who would know what a growing finger would sound like. A green finger had sprouted through the mangled flesh of Charlie’s middle knuckle and then the other came through his ring finger. We all stared it- the human hand with three alien fingers, those being much longer than Charlie’s original fingers. It was a startling mash up of demon and man, the metamorphosis of which was not quite finished. He tapped his fingers on the arm of the chair as if waiting patiently to resume his grisly transformation. \n\n“I want my coin Gatlin,” said Charlie. His voice was different. It was deeper and full of malice. \n\n“What is he talking about?”\n\n“Lieutenant, I don’t know.” My lie immediately betrayed me. I couldn’t help myself but I looked right at it. The Lieutenant walked over to pick it up. \n\n“Don’t touch it!!!”\n\n“Gatlin, you’ve got some explaining to do.”\n\n“I can’t explain this.”\n\nThe Lieutenant thought better of it and told me that it was my responsibility to clean up the mess and to get rid of the coin. Everyone was to fill out an incident report but before we did we were going to meet and discuss the appropriate details and which should be included and which should be omitted.  As the Lieutenant left the bathroom, I could hear him yelling at the inmates to get back to their bunks.\n\nThey rolled Charlie into the medical office and left him with the nurse. This was a minimum-security facility. There was no room especially made for suicide watch. If it ever got to that point, you called the psychiatrist and had him pump the inmate full of Haldol and shipped downtown and that was our immediate plan of action. I first had to clean up the biohazard that was pieces of Charlie in the pod bathroom. \n\nI had my latex gloves on but I didn’t feel one bit safe when it came to picking up that coin. I started first with the fingers. I picked those up and put them into the red biohazard bags. I was shocked to see no blood. Was it true? Had I really seen that coin absorb the blood? I didn’t know but I felt relieved that I didn’t have to clean up blood. The coin seem to shimmer and glow. I know it was all in my head but it stood out. It scared me. Where was this thing from? Where did he get it? I was scared too not just because Charlie was a monster but he was a monster with a personal vendetta against me. I was going to make it right, but he had changed before I had the chance. \n\n“Code Red!! Code Red!! Code Red!! Medical office! Medical office!”\n\nI hesitated. I did not want to answer that call. Who would blame me. I waited for a moment and then something just pushed me to go. I had to respond. I ran as fast as I could down the hall past the kitchen. I could see the other officers running from the opposite end but there was no excitement in their faces, not even a nervous anticipation of action, but a look of unadulterated fear. They didn’t want to respond either. We as a group turned up the hall leading to the medical office. Other officers were gathered outside the door but couldn’t get in. I could hear the buzzer but the door would not budge. I ran up to the window and peered inside. \n\nThe nurse was a big man. It was odd that he was a nurse and not an officer but even odder than that was that he was laying on his stomach but his neck was twisted so that he was looking up at the ceiling. His arms were broken and laid across his back. Charlie had climbed about five feet up the wall like a spider. His flesh was torn on various spots of his body. He had been biting off what flesh he could, revealing another body underneath. On the nurse’s desk was an eyeball. It was Charlie’s. Nothing alien had grown in his empty eye socket, at least not yet. \n\n“We’ve got to get in there and restrain him.”\n\n“No, we don’t,” mumbled Officer Devon. \n\n“Charlie, your coin is still in the bathroom.”\n\nI don’t know what possessed me to say that, but I think I wanted a resolution and I wanted it fast. Charlie turned his head far enough for me to see his other still-intact eye. \n\n“My coin. Yes, please.”\n\nFor a moment I thought I heard the old passive Charlie. \n\n“Get away from the door and go back to your pods,” I said. \n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“Early release Lieutenant.”\n\nWe all cleared from the door and walked back to our pods, well except for me. I went to the recreation room of the pod across from my assigned pod and waited with Devon. I radioed up to booking and told them that they were to buzz open the door to the yard when I radioed to do so. Devon and I just waited and watched. \n\n“We should go and get your inmates out of there and put them in this pod, don’t you think?”\n\n“Sure, if you want to, but I’m staying right here.” I felt bad but I was sure that Charlie was more concerned with escaping instead of hurting other inmates, or at least I hoped so. \n\nSoon Charlie came limping up the hallway. He looked like a calico cat that had been run over by a car. In some places he was a torn, bloodied, and battered human and in other places he had patches of scaly skin, not resembling anything from this world. He walked through the recreation room and disappeared through the dark of the living quarters. It took a while but eventually he came back out and stopped in the recreation room peering through the thick security glass. I walked out of Devon’s pod and walked towards the door that led out to the yard where inmates were usually loaded into trucks to work the road crew. \n\n“Buzz the door open.”\n\nThe door unlocked and I propped it open with a door stop. Charlie was watching me but wouldn’t move. I decided to walk back to Devon’s pod and go back inside. I wasn’t going to get in Charlie’s way. Looking through the security glass across to the other security glass where Charlie was standing gave me a strange sense that I was now his prisoner. I would never be able to not think about him, to not fear him. I was his prisoner. \n\nCharlie hobbled out of the recreation room. He made his way past the end of the pod and walked out the yard door and to freedom. I hurried to the yard to catch a glimpse of him and which way he would be going. I saw him scramble up the fence with ease and crawl over the top of the razor wire. The razor wire was clutching to his skin, but he didn’t care. It was as if he didn’t even feel it. He pushed his body over the other side of the fence and dropped to the ground. I could see that the wire cut him deep from his elbows to his wrist. He bled profusely, spilling out and falling to the wet grass. He saw me looking at him. He clutched the fence with his hands. \n\n“Gatlin, remember to squat and cough.”\n\nCharlie walked away. The monster was free. Laying on the pavement of the yard in front of the fence was a shiny coin.",

        "text": "[If you need to catch up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j0inm/every_christmas_someone_leaves_a_body_part_on_my/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHill was sitting in our kitchen within half an hour. He was hazy-eyed and chugging coffee as quickly as James could refill his cup, but he was alert for it being the middle of the night. I was working up the nerve to ask what was in this gift when he blurted it out unprompted. \n\n“It was a face,” Hill said, staring into his mug. “A human face. Just the face. Jesus, it was cut off clean with a razor.” \n\nJames cleared his throat. “I don’t think we need-”\n\n“Was it a woman?” I asked. Hill nodded. “Did she look like me?” \n\nHe took a shaky breath. “Probably. At one point. The…object was distorted, stretched. Like someone was playing with it for a few days after, uh, Christ. After.” \n\n“Did your officers see Nate leaving his house?” James asked.\n\n“No. I checked in and the guys in the car didn’t see a damn thing. Nate went to bed around eleven, lights out around midnight, and no sign of activity between then and when I got your call three or so hours later.”\n\n“He might have slipped out,” I suggested. “Given the cops outside the slip.” \n\n“Maybe,” Hill agreed neutrally. “I’m going to post a unit outside your place for the next day or two. See if our friend is going for a hat trick.” The detective stood up and drained the rest of his coffee. “I’m going to head back to sleep. If you two could come into the station sometime in the morning after nine, we can talk about next steps.”\n\nA round of quick handshakes and Hill was gone. \n\n“Good God,” I said, collapsing into a chair in the living room, “he sent a *face*. Skinned. Peeled. Some poor-”\n\nJames put a hand on my knee. “We’re going to get him this year. He’s slipping up. Remember, he said, ‘This is the year.’ He’s right, but not in the way he thinks. Nate will not be bothering us ever again.” \n\n“Do you really think it’s him?”\n\n“I don’t know. Maybe. Probably. Either way, *somebody* is out there and that same somebody is **done** scaring you.” James stood up. “Look, I know you’re not a fan of violence. I appreciate that. I *love* that about you. But after the box the other day, I…I went out and bought a gun.”\n\n“James.” \n\nHe held up his hand and then folded it down to two fingers. “A shotgun. Two barrels. Over and under, not side by side. It’s for shooting skeet. Or, you know, it can be after we’re done. For now, it’s for keeping us safe.” He looked at the baseball bat I’d left in the corner of the room. “I think it’s a good idea.” \n\n“Where is it?” \n\nJames walked over to the coat closet between the living and dining room. He rummaged around in the back for a moment, then pulled out a long gun with a pair of black barrels stacked vertically. The shotgun ended in a glossy wooden stock. James broke it open after struggling with a switch for a moment. He pulled a small box from high up in the closet and then walked over with the gun, which was opened on a hinge just above the trigger area. \n\n“It’s a twelve-gauge,” my husband explained, opening the box. Inside were rows of plump red cylinders that reminded me of rolled pennies. “These are the shells. All you have to do is load them in the barrels then close it.” He demonstrated, snapping the gun closed. “This is the safety. White means, ‘safe,’ and red means, ‘ready to fire.’ You point somewhere in the target’s general direction and pull the trigger. That fires one barrel. Pull it again to shoot the second. Then you press this lever-thingy to open it back up.” \n\nI stared at the gun as he extracted the unfired shells. “James, I don’t think I could ever shoot somebody.” \n\nHe nodded. “I hope you never need to. But I feel better knowing you can protect yourself in case things hit the fan. The gun will be in the closet–unloaded–and the shells will be on the shelf above.” James kissed me on the forehead. “Let’s go back to sleep.”\n\nWe took a slow drive around the neighborhood in the morning. James protested but I wanted to make sure the squad car was still observing Nate. It turns out Hill hadn’t posted a squad car; he actually set up two undercover units. James noticed them first and only because we were looking for cops. Two non-descript sedans parked at either end of Nate’s street, each car containing two very “police” looking men. You know the type: buzz cuts, bland suits, aviator shades. \n\n“You think they fell asleep on the job?” James asked, parking the car. “Let Nate slip out last night?” \n\n“Maybe they’re in on it,” I joked, chuckling until I saw a hard look on my husband’s face. “Oh, come on. They’re the cops.” \n\nJames tapped a finger on the wheel. “Yeah. You’re right. The cops never do anything wrong.” \n\nWe sat for a few minutes. It was early, yet, and the clouds had that shredded wool-and-cloth look that meant more snow was likely. The radio was playing faintly, some Christmas station. One song ended with me barely listening. Then *it* came on. \n\n*Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh*\n\n*Ah-ah*\n\n*… Last Christmas, I gave you-*\n\nI turned the radio off. I was shaking. \n\n“We should go,” James said, pulling out from the curb. “Let’s go see Hill.” \n\nI nodded, not trusting myself to speak. As we were driving out of the neighborhood, I glanced back down the street. Nate was standing on his porch watching us. For a second, I almost asked James to turn around but I decided I wasn’t ready to confront my old stalker yet. Not until we had proof he’d been tormenting me for the last decade. \n\nNot until I was sure he was my sick, secret admirer and giver of gifts.\n\nHill’s office was a lot like the detective who occupied it: basic, tidy, boring. The most interesting thing I observed was a collection of those bobblehead-type figures–funky something–sitting on a shelf behind his desk. Each of the little statues was from a popular horror movie; I recognized more than half even if I didn’t know all of their names. There was chainsaw butcher guy, dude in the hockey mask, burned-up finger claw fella, and maybe a dozen others.\n\n“Didn’t realize you were a horror fan,” James remarked, also studying the figures. \n\n“Huge,” Hill admitted. “Basically a horror and true crime junkie. My only vice. Other than all the other vices.” \n\nHe winked. I smiled back but felt a little uncomfortable, though I couldn’t put a finger on why. \n\n“I double-checked with my guys in your neighborhood,” Hill continued. “Nobody saw a thing. I’ve put a unit outside of your house but I can only justify keeping these folks on overtime for a few days. I’m going to pull them all back Saturday. Just a heads up.” \n\nJames was squeezing the arm of his chair. “And if Nate shows up after that?” \n\n“We’ll get him–*if* it’s him–eventually,” Hill promised. “I don’t plan on letting this gruesome gift crap continue for another decade, no knock on my predecessor.” \n\n“How did our case end up on your desk?” I asked. \n\n“I requested it after Jim retired.” \n\n“Why?”\n\nHill took a moment to answer. “Emma, James, I’ll level with you: I think what’s been happening to you is fascinating.” James raised an eyebrow and Hill spread his palms in a calming gesture. “Okay, not the best word choice but you see what I mean, right? Ten years of untraceable Christmas gifts, each box containing a body part. When he sends fingers the prints are burned off. Skulls come with the teeth removed to prevent identification by dental records. He even drains the parts of blood and pumps bleach through to clean them out.”\n\nI felt my stomach flip. “I didn’t know that.” \n\nHill was smiling, not looking at me. “It’s, I mean, it’s a little genius and *deeply* unique. Have you ever thought about selling your story?” \n\n“Excuse me?” James asked. \n\n“You know, a book deal. A podcast. ‘Sadistic Santa Claus and his Grisly Gifts.’ Something like that.” \n\n“That’s not really…I don’t really want to talk about that,” I said. I could sense James was about to get a harsher reply so I changed the subject. “Can you at least bring Nate in for questioning?” \n\nHill frowned, clearly wanting to go on the book sale topic. \n\n“Without any proof, there’s not a lot that will accomplish.”\n\n“Maybe he’ll crack under the pressure,” James suggested. \n\n“Is that what happened to get him to leave Emma alone the first time?” Hill asked. “Did you, uh, ‘crack’ him under pressure.” \n\nI saw James’ eye twitch. “I just had a talk with him.”\n\n“Just like that? And months of stalking and incidents stopped?”\n\n“Just like that,” James said, coldly. \n\nHill leaned back in his chair. “I’ve been looking through the files on that. Emma, you never actually *saw* Nate messing with your car or breaking windows, right?” \n\n“Yeah. Yes, *but* I did notice him following me many times after we broke up.” \n\n“And he would knock on the door and call at odd hours, correct?”\n\n“Correct.”\n\n“But–again–you never saw him or talked to him directly?” \n\n“What are you implying?” I asked. \n\n“Not a thing,” Hill replied. “I’m just getting my ducks in a row.” \n\nI stood up. “If you don’t talk to Nate, I’m going to.”\n\n“I wouldn’t recommend that, Emma. I really would not.” Hill glanced at my husband. “Both of you should stay far away from this man. Let us do our jobs.” \n\n“First time for everything,” James muttered. \n\nWe left Hill in his office sitting under his shelf of horror toys. The drive back home was silent without conversation or radio. As we pulled into the drive, James took a breath. \n\n“I agree with you,” he said. \n\n“About what?” \n\nHe gave me a long look. James had put on a little weight during our marriage but still had the scrappy, athletic vibe that drove me wild when we first met. His eyes were so blue they seemed painted on. And, at that moment, those eyes were colder than I’d ever seen them. \n\n“This ends this year,” James promised. “No more us being afraid to open the door every December. No more taking long trips knowing that the packages would be waiting. No more fear.” \n\nI felt a rush of love, primal love. \n\n“Okay,” I said. “But what’s the plan? We can’t just invite him over for coffee to catch up?” \n\nA little smile tugged at my husband’s lips. “Why not?”\n\nThe plan was a simple one: we waited until the weekend when the cops would be gone. I still had Nate’s number in my phone ten years later (though it was blocked). The gist was that James and I would invite Nate over to try to bury the hatchet. It was a decade after all the mess, after all. James figured that if Nate really was innocent, he’d be happy to clear the air and wouldn’t even know about the deliveries I’d been receiving. But, if Nate was behind it, how could he resist talking to me again in person? \n\nUnfortunately, Nate must have changed his number because my texts all bounced back. However, I was able to find him on social media, and just like James predicted, my ex was all too eager to chat. I made a completely fresh account with no information other than my name and picture for the exchange. Nate told me he’d actually been working up the nerve to contact me after seeing me in the neighborhood. He said it felt like fate that he ended up moving in only a block away. \n\n“I’m not saying it’s a second chance,” my ex said, “and I know you’re probably married, but maybe we could be friends?”\n\nI told him I think maybe we could and invited him over for coffee that same evening. \n\nNate showed up promptly at 9 pm freshly shaved and wearing a black blazer over a t-shirt and jeans. I recognized it immediately as his “casual formal” look from when we went on dates to nicer places. He even wore something like that to prom, like he was allergic to ties or suit pants. \n\n“Emma, you look amazing,” Nate said, accepting my handshake though I knew he wanted a hug. “You haven’t changed. Still a stunner.” \n\nI smiled. “And you’re still a charmer. Come on in.”\n\nI closed the door behind him and led him toward the kitchen. \n\n“Beautiful house,” Nate remarked, biting his lip. “Look, I just want to get it out there that I really appreciate you-”\n\nNate stopped when we got into the kitchen and he saw James standing at the counter, pouring coffee. For a second, I almost thought Nate would run.\n\n“What’s he doing here?” my ex whispered. \n\n“Well, we’re married.” \n\n“You married *him*?” \n\n“It’s good to see you too, bud,” James replied, setting three coffee mugs on the table. He patted a chair. “Have a seat.”\n\nNate didn’t move. \n\n“It’s okay,” I promised, taking his hand. “I told you I was married.” \n\n“Yeah, but you didn’t say to whom.” \n\nJames held up his hands in surrender. “I know you and I didn’t get along when we first met.” \n\n“No kidding.” \n\n“I’m here to make peace,” my husband continued. “We were practically kids back then. We’re adults now. Let’s bury it.” \n\nNate glanced at me, then back at the door. I figured he might be nervous to see James. I knew my husband probably confronted him harshly about the stalking but this was a whole different level. Nate reminded me of a rabbit who wandered into a doghouse. \n\n“Please,” I said, tugging on his hand. “We’re just going to talk.” \n\nNate reluctantly allowed me to lead him to the table. We all sat quietly for a moment, drinking our coffee. I saw Nate’s mug had a slight tremor. Eventually, he calmed down enough that I was ready to ask him straight out about the gifts. But James started before I could. \n\n“What are you doing in this neighborhood?” he asked, his eyes with that distant, icy look again. A blue sky threatening snow.  “I told you to stay away.” \n\n“I-I didn’t know this was where you lived. I swear. It’s a coincidence.” \n\n“You said, ‘fate,’ when we talked earlier,” I reminded him. \n\n“Fate?” James asked. “Like a love story?” \n\nNate kept opening and closing his mouth. “That’s not what I meant.”\n\n“You’re saying my wife is lying?”\n\n“No! No.” Nate turned to me. “I’m not here to try anything. I promise. I thought you just wanted to clear things up.” \n\n“Why did you stalk me? Why did you slash my tires? You made me feel unsafe, terrified.” \n\nNate shook his head. “I didn’t! I never did any of that. Okay–okay, I *did* follow you around a little after we broke up. But that was just me being lovesick. I never did any of the other stuff the police talked to me about.” \n\nHe sounded so convincing, so honest. It didn’t make sense. I decided to dive into the deep end.\n\n“Nate, have you been leaving…gifts for me every December? I’ve been getting *unusual* packages every year for the last decade.” \n\n“What? No. Of course not. I didn’t even know where you lived until a week ago. And, even if I did,” he looked at James, “I knew I was supposed to stay away.” \n\nJames drained the last of his coffee. “So it really was a coincidence you moved in down the street from us? Just bad luck?” \n\n“*Yes*,” Nate hissed. “I’m swearing to you, on my life. Random. Stupid. Chance.”\n\nJames nodded and stood up. “Could be but, personally, now I’m thinking it was fate. I knew when I saw you moving in a few weeks ago that this was going to be the year.” He walked over to the coffee pot. “Anybody want a refill?” \n\nNate was staring at me, his eyes pleading. There was a roaring in my ears. My pulse. Everything James said was clicking into place. He was humming as he poured another cup of coffee. \n\n*Hmmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmmm hmmmm*. \n\nI recognized the tune from the card and the car. \n\n“James?” I said. “You said you saw Nate move in weeks ago? Why wouldn’t you tell me that?” \n\nNate leaned forward and gripped my arm. “*Please*,” he whispered. “Whatever you think I did, don’t let him-”\n\n“James!” I screamed. \n\nHe moved so fast. One second he was at the counter, the next he was smashing the half-filled coffee pot over the back of Nate’s head. My ex screamed, his scalp torn up by the boiling liquid and broken glass. The scream was cut short as James wrapped a strong arm around Nate’s throat from behind in a chokehold. I stood up so quickly my chair fell but after that, I was frozen. Nate’s face was red, both from burns and from lack of air. I didn’t know what to do. Nothing made sense. \n\nThen my husband winked, forearm still slowly crushing the other man’s windpipe.\n\n“I told you this would be our year, Emma,” he said. “I’ve been waiting to tell you for so long; ever since the first time I saw you. But it was *so hard* to express how I felt about you.”\n\nNate’s eyes were going back into his head, his arms falling limp. I saw tears going down his cheeks. I looked over at James with his wide, hungry grin. That got me moving. \n\n“Where are you going?” my husband called out cheerfully. \n\nTwenty steps or so to the closet. A few seconds fumbling for the gun in the back including a false start grabbing an umbrella. A couple of heartbeats were spent struggling with the lever, all the while wondering if I’d feel James’ arm snake around my own throat. Two bright red shells like small firecrackers, one in each barrel. I swiveled with the gun to find James standing in the space between the kitchen and living room, Nate’s unconscious–or dead–body held in front of him. \n\n“I’m sorry I took so long to tell you,” James said, his grin a little softer now. “I followed you for months. Took care of the competition. Ya know, I even thought that once we were together it might be enough. I might be satisfied. But there was so much love it made me ill, overwhelmed me, tore up my guts. You ever see a puppy so cute you want to squeeze it to death? You know that feeling, right? That’s how I felt every time I looked at you, every morning I woke up next to you. I had to find girls just a little like you or maybe I would have needed to squeeze *you*.” He frowned. “I don’t want you to think I did anything with them inappropriate. I’ve always been faithful.”\n\n“You killed them?” \n\n“After I hurt them, yes.” \n\nI had a finger on the trigger but knew I’d hit Nate if I fired. If I *could* fire. It all seemed like a nightmare I would wake up from at any minute.\n\n“Why send me the…the *pieces*?” I asked, voice breaking. \n\nJames smiled like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “To show you how much I loved you. How much I thought about you. Constantly. And those girls, the ones that reminded me of you, how dare they, you know? How dare they act like they were your competition?” \n\n“That’s insane.”\n\n“Hey, don’t be mean. Honestly, can you think of a more unique gift? It doesn’t make you feel special?” \n\nBefore I could think of a reply, James suddenly shoved Nate towards me. I fired on reflex, blasting a red chunk from my ex-boyfriend's ribs. \n\n“Nate!” I shrieked, stunned. \n\nJames was on me before I remembered I had a second shot. I felt a heavy fist sink so far into my stomach that I worried it would push out through the other side. I folded up, not blacking out but seeing spots. For a long time, all I could do was try to catch my breath curled into a fetal position on the rug. I heard a ripping sound and then footsteps going back into the kitchen. James came back and stood just behind me. Music drifted to me from the kitchen, dreadful and familiar. \n\n*Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh*\n\n*Ah-ah*\n\n*… Last Christmas, I gave you my heart*\n\n*But the very next day, you gave it away*\n\n*This year, to save me from tears, I’ll give it to someone special*\n\n“You need some time to process this,” I heard my husband say from above me. “I understand. Don’t worry; I’ll be around. I’ll know when you’re ready.” \n\nSomething warm and heavy landed in the space between my arms and face. I kept my eyes closed but the smell made me gag. \n\n“This is *our* year,” James said, leaning down to kiss my hair. \n\nThen he was walking away, humming along with that song. I thought about the gun, about trying to stop him, but it hurt so bad just breathing. I found out later he’d cracked two of my ribs. It was a long time before I opened my eyes. It hurt so much to scream, the pain ripping up my side like a striking match. \n\nNate’s wet, purple-red heart lay on the floor inches from my face. I cried, and that hurt, too. My phone was in the kitchen and the music got louder as I crawled across the floor.\n\n*\"Merry Christmas, \" I wrapped it up and sent it*\n\n*With a note saying, \"I love you, \" I meant it*\n\n*Now I know what a fool I've been*\n\n*But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again*",

        "text": "Mom accidentally no-clipped into the back rooms when I was 13. I called to her from downstairs to request help with my math homework, but when I met her at the stairs, her left foot had slipped and she tumbled down each step. Bracing myself for the painful thud and moans of pain that her fall should produce, you can imagine I was quite shocked to find that her body had phased completely through the floor.\n\nI immediately called the police and attempted to explain the strange situation to the best of my ability, but they didn’t seem to take it seriously. Of course they assumed it was just a strange teenager prank calling them. \n\nHowever, I thought I heard a knock on my door within the immediate time after Mom’s vanishing, in which I foolishly searched the basement to see if she somehow would be there, right below the floor at the base of the staircase. I hadn’t fully processed the knock when I heard a crash and heavy footsteps swarming the upper layer of my house.\n\nLike any young teen would do, I hid to the best of my ability, which unfortunately happened to be in my basement closet. Despite my best efforts, I guess my muffled whimpering was still loud enough for the strange intruders to hear me, as the closet door had been yanked open after what was likely only a few minutes.\n\nStanding before me was a slim man in a pristine black and white business suit with a faded fedora shielding his eyes.\n\n“Hey kid, your mommy is gone. I’m sorry,” he responded in a sympathetic whisper upon recognizing my fear and confusion.\n\nHe ordered me to follow him, which my grieving mind allowed my body to do without resistance, and I sat down in the passenger seat of an unmarked car. Next to me sat another man, who gave me a subtle nod to acknowledge my presence.\n\n“Aw man, a kid saw it this time?” mumbled the man in the passenger seat, who shared identical attire to the man who had discovered me.\n\n“Unfortunately, yes,” replied the other man as he turned the ignition for his car.\n\nThe drive felt like a fever dream, but I recall brief pieces of the events following the drive, such as the slim man in the passenger seat nudging me out of the vehicle and ushering me into an unfamiliar building. He showed the secretary at the front desk what appeared to be some form of identification before I met my caretaker, Ms. Gertrude, who brought me into a bare room with four beds.\n\nIn the following weeks, I had a three hour counseling session with a team of medical professionals on a daily basis. Ms. Gertrude, who I considered to be a parental figure, would lead me to these appointments, which were located in isolated rooms on the opposite end of the orphanage, where no other children were located. In these meetings, the professionals explained to me that my Mom died when I was six years old, and that I lived my entire life in an orphanage. Furthermore, they claimed that any memories I had of my “Mom” beyond the weeks following my sixth birthday was simply a mental image of what I hoped my family was like. Therefore, at the conclusion of each session, I was provided medication to reverse the effects of what they referred to as “delusions.”\n\nI grew up in an orphanage, in which I believed for most of my life that I was both insane and had amnesia between the ages of 6 and 13. I was constantly fearful that a relapse would occur, so I kept a secret diary of significant events that occurred at the end of every week.\n\nAs time passed, boys my age would enter and leave my shared bedroom when they lost parents or were adopted. I was never adopted, and neither was another boy in my bedroom named Jack. Perhaps we were destined to be friends.\n\nJack and I had a few interesting similarities. We both believed that we had become orphans when our moms died shortly after our sixth birthdays. Both of us had periods of what the doctors claimed were “rogue spells,” in which our minds would wander and create idealistic scenarios in which we lived a joyful life. Our lifestyles were quite different though, as Jack embraced athleticism and fitness to improve his drained mental health, while I turned to research and learning. Despite this, we both stayed good friends during our time in the orphanage.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I became a freelance plumber while Jack had been accepted into a university with an athletics scholarship for football. For the past two years apart, we had little more contact than occasional messages through social media. That all changed four days ago when Jack sent me an urgent text message saying “We need to talk. Come over to my apartment now. I promise, this is life changing.”\n\nI originally intended to tell a joke in response, as he couldn’t possibly expect me to drive two hours to his apartment at 11 at night. I had a high-paying client that needed to be attended to the next day, and I could not risk missing out on such money. Before I could respond to his unreasonable demand, I looked at my phone to find that he sent another text: \n\n“It’s about our parents.”\n\nI wasted no more time and arrived at Jack’s apartment a little after 1 in the morning. I climbed the stairs to reach his apartment on the 3rd floor, and I knocked on his door. Only a few seconds passed before Jack swung the door open and ushered me inside.\n\nDressed in sweatpants and wearing a tight tank top which emphasized his muscular build, he directed me to his dining room table, in which he had a laptop sitting on the table.\n\n“Hey,” he muttered bluntly. “I think we’ve been lied to, man.”\n\n“Lied to?” I asked inquisitively. “What do you mean? We were both raised by single mothers who passed away when we were six years old.”\n\n“How?” replied Jack. “How did she die? Did they ever tell you? They never told me how my mom died.”\n\n“Well,” I pondered. “I’m not sure. I guess they just didn’t want to upset me, so they never did.”\n\n“Your mother didn’t die when you were six! I can prove it!” he exclaimed, slamming his fist on the table before turning the screen of his laptop around to reveal a message board of sorts titled *Backrooms to Earth.*\n\nI squinted at the screen to find a post from the profile *FindMyMatt*, which included the following:\n\n*Oh Matt, I’m so sorry that I haven’t been able to contact you. I’m stuck in a strange land that I’ve come to learn is known as the Backrooms. I’ve managed to seek refuge with the M.E.G community at Base Alpha, but soon I will be venturing further. Please do not seek to find me. I will find you. Do not worry about me Matt, and stay far away from the stairs,*\n\n*I love you so much,*\n\n*Mom*\n\nI was in disbelief, not knowing whether Mom had really written such a message. My jaw hung open before Jack impatiently cut me off.\n\n“Did she no-clip?”\n\n“What do you mean, Jack?” I responded puzzled.\n\n“Did she phase through something and disappear? Did she, Matt? I know this memory has been repressed by pills and propaganda, but think Matt! Think!”\n\nBy now, he had clamped a hand on both of my shoulders and was shaking my short, scrawny body like a ragdoll. As his coffee breath invaded my nostrils with a pungent odor, something in my mind just clicked. Marissa, Mom, had fallen through the floor of my staircase when I was 13.\n\n“Jack, she fell through the floor on her tumble down the staircase. I… I don’t know what happened to her.”\n\nJack fell quiet as his arms went limp. “My mom and I were going for a hike in the forest when one of her feet suddenly pressed through the floor. Not like a shoe sinking in mud or quicksand, but more like a shoe attempting to stand on a hologram. She completely lost balance and fell through. I remember my mom, Matt.” His recollection of such events appeared to puncture his soul as his eyes began to tear up.\n\n“I was doing research, and I think my mom and your mom have fallen into the Backrooms, man.”\n\nContrary to how one might expect a person to respond in such a situation, the cogs in my mind began to grind together, producing a crude, yet straightforward plan.\n\n“We need to go to the Backrooms,” I stated.\n\nJack’s eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets. “We can’t go! We’ll never get back, and we don’t even know if our moms are alive. Hell, the post by your Mom was 2 months ago! How do we know where she is now?”\n\nMy eyes laid daggers at the picture of an endless maze of yellow paper illuminated by the monotony of fluorescent lights, which acted as a crude logo for the forum.\n\n“I never knew what my purpose was in this world. At this moment, everything has been taken from me. My childhood began with only a single mom, who sacrificed everything to give me the life she believed I deserved. Then my Mom was taken from me. My family was decimated by the demons of chance, and so has my life. I don’t have any friends aside from you, I work an unsatisfying career, and though I make decent money, I’m not happy. I will never be happy. Do you know what would make me happy? Seeing my mom. I have nothing to lose, so why not take the gamble to see my mom again. My mom is my world, and I will find her.”\n\nJack stood stiff for a second before tears flushed down his cheeks.\n\n“Mom was my world too. I miss her so much. I know I need to find her,” he whimpered.\n\nFrom this conversation, we agreed to do the unthinkable. We would immigrate to the Backrooms.\n\nThrough researching various message boards, we prepared necessary tools and skills that would be needed to survive in the Backrooms. We each purchased large backpacks with a plastic reusable water bottle, some protein bars, and basic first aid supplies to minimize the chance that we would immediately die. We also brought portable battery packs and our phones to document our travels, and ask for advice if necessary, as well as string and markers to help navigate the large environment.\n\nIn terms of weapons, we determined that guns would be pointless. It may be difficult to find bullets to use, so we instead decided on purchasing bows and arrows, since we could retrieve and reuse all arrows fired. After much discussion regarding what was necessary, we determined that one compound bow and twenty arrows should be attached to each of our backpacks. Additionally, we knew that melee combat may be necessary too, so we settled on katanas for combat purposes, as they were relatively light weight, and appeared easy to use.\n\nFor the next week, we spent hours each day practicing our archery. Neither of us had much prior experience, but after relentless practice, we were confident that we could shoot relatively accurately.\n\nThe night before we attempted the no-clip, we added some last minute supplies, such as small flashlights, pocket knives, and tarps (if collecting water would be necessary). The next day, we returned to my childhood home.\n\n“How does this stupid thing work?” muttered Jack as he stomped his foot at the base of the staircase. \n\nThankfully, the house was far away from others in the neighborhood and appeared vacant, so entering it did not draw any unwanted attention.\n\n“It requires your entire body weight,” I stated matter-of-factly. “Well, I think your entire body weight plus some momentum,” I clarified. “My mom fell from the top of the staircase down to the bottom.”\n\n“Eh, alright,” concluded Jack defeatedly. “I guess there’s only one way to find out.”\n\nJack climbed up before flinging himself sideways off the top of the stairs. He grunted as his arm hit the wooden staircase multiple times before crying out in confusion as his body slid through the floorboards.\n\nSomething about the human brain prohibits the body from making actions that are known to be painful. The pinky on a human finger can be bit off like a carrot, yet no human dares to try because no human desires to see the consequences of such an action.\n\nAfter a few minutes of stalling, I convinced myself to just jump and think of the consequences later. Of course, I did jump backwards so my back could hopefully cushion the fall. Despite having my eyes closed, something about my fall felt unnatural. Perhaps it was due to the unusual length of time I was in freefall, or it could’ve been due to the impact of hitting the floor not hurting. I thought the surface I landed on would surely be rock solid, but my body felt as if it was landing on a damp, squishy cloud. As I opened my eyes to the painfully bright fluorescent light, I knew I was on Level 0 of the Backrooms.\n\n“Hey, Jack,” I called in a loud whisper, as to not immediately draw the attention of any potential monsters.\n\n“It’s fine, Matt,” replied Jack. “There are no other entities on Level 0, remember? There’s no need to be quiet. We just need to continue.”\n\n“Alright, I have a marker. Let’s get started.”\n\nAccording to my analog clock, it took us 13 days and 7 hours to no-clip to level 1, though it felt only like a few hours. We marked each direction we traveled so as to not get lost and attempted a no-clip together at every moment we felt the chance of doing so was probable. Obviously, our assessments of probability were often incorrect, but we eventually no-clipped together near a shaded wall that made us both uneasy staring at it.\n\nUpon phasing through the wall, we found ourselves in a settlement that contained the sign “Base Alpha” in large painted letters. Though the explorers and wanderers at such an outpost were initially startled by our appearance (and initially brandished swords in our faces), they seemed to find pity in our terrified faces and welcomed us with open arms.\n\n“Sorry,” muttered a man wearing a backwards baseball cap. “This place isn’t known to contain hostile entities, so you have to understand that we were startled by the arrival of two humanoids who were armed to the teeth,” he explained. “I’m General Frederick Sturgeon, head command at Base Alpha,” he exclaimed proudly before his expression shifted to inquisitive. “Wait, why do you have so much supplies?”\n\nWe attempted to explain our goal to General Sturgeon before he suddenly burst out laughing when we explained that we entered the Backrooms voluntarily..\n\n“I don’t know if you’re stupid, or crazy, but this place… the Backrooms… is worse than all circles of hell combined. This isn’t exactly a vacation spot.”\n\n“We’re not here for vacation,” Jack boomed. “We, Matt and I, want to find our moms. They’ve got to be alive. Well, Matt’s mom is alive, but mine must be too!”\n\n“You’re Matt?” asked General Sturgeon, obviously startled by such a question. “Marissa said she was looking for you. Did you stumble on her forum post on *Backrooms to Earth*? Oh jeez, she is not gonna like this.”\n\n“Why?” I demanded. “Why does she not want me here?”\n\n“Matt,” stammered General Sturgeon as he removed his cap. “She wants you to be safe. She only talked about you for the past several years. But…” he stopped talking, as if choosing his words carefully. “Her love for you made her mind go a bit… loopy. She and three other members of this outpost fell for the temptation of the Gabriel Family’s false promises. I really couldn’t stop her. She just left while I was asleep three weeks ago.” He began to choke on his words. \n\n“Matt, she’s planning on sacrificing other wanderers because she’s convinced that completing their blood ritual will bring her home.”",

        "text": "You may or may not have heard about the water park \"incident\".  Many people claim it was an accident, but i think it might have been caused by a poltergeist or maybe a creature of some sort! Here goes one of the worst water park days of all time. It all happened years ago of course at a water park.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was there in the \"lazy river\", as people called it, damn kids, always getting in my way of a relaxing pool time. Anyways there was this huge water slide, I would say twelve people would go down it at once, I wouldn't go down it if my life depended on it. Thing looks like it would fall apart any moment, which, eventually did happen and caused the \"incident.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was almost doing my 46 lap around the lazy river that day, when some more kids decided to jump on my tube and start splashing me. I was out of it  I couldn't even think, but, eventually they did. Oh man I hate those kids, Hope the water slide i was talking about breaks and they get hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I remember the exact time it happened, 5:53PM. I was just about to wrap up my day at the water park and i noticed a giant figure, honestly I wouldn't even call it that. But right as i saw it pass through of the supports of the water slide the entire slide came out crushing multiple people and injuring hundreds. I couldn't really breathe at what i was seeing. Really i was just so tired of those kids I really didn't even have the energy to be shocked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course the water park was shut down and we all had to go home, I didn't really wanna watch the news, I felt, kinda, tired to be apart of something like this. I hurridly came into the living room though when i noticed my son was watching the news about the incident. There was this beautiful reporter her name was at the bottom of the screen showing \"ALLISON REPORTING TO THE SCENE OF COLLAPSED WATER SLIDE AT AMUSEMENT PARK\" I couldn't believe what I was seeing how, could, I-I do, such a thing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't wanna kill hundreds but i just wanted to have some peace alone. I turned the TV off and put my son to bed and went to bed my self. Earlier that night, I woke up to, voices, well in my head, Is this whats is like when you kill? Voices of the  people? I decided to go to another water park. It was dark, it was windy, very windy. Almost to the point where I couldn't stand. Yeah right that had to been the cause, just wind right? I laughed a little at that thought, knowing I was gonna be caught eventually, as the voices got stronger I realized, maybe, Loosing the bolts of THIS slide is not such a good idea. Ah i thought maybe them kids will be taught not to mess with old people on the lazy river.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking about those past times maybe, I really should't go to another water park tonight, I mean, I do plan on going and loosing the massive bolts. It gives me joy in knowing i did good for the world, getting rid of those kids. I hope this is a lesson to all of you out there, that, first, never mess with old people at water parks and never, ever, go down a water slide.",

        "text": "So, a few days ago I had a really bad dream that I thought you guys would like it \n\nFor starters, it was a bit of a heavy day, but I managed to get a good night watching some Netflix and all that stuff\nBecause it was already pretty late, I ended up sleeping somewhat fast in my bed, hoping I get a good dream to forget all the stuff that happened in the morning, and I really thought that was what had happened at first \nThe dream began this way:\n\nThe sky was clear and blue, the sun giving a beautiful golden light, and to make everything better, I was with my girlfriend in what I can only describe as the best date we ever had\nWe were under a big tree shadow at the top of a little hill just outside the city, giving us a great view of all the cars and houses bellow us\nBut, something was off\nI can't really tell you what it was. It was more of a feeling than anything\nThen it happened \nThe sky started to darken as if we were in midnight, the hill began to fall and the city ignited in gigantic flames with an explosion as loud as thunder right besides me\nWhat once was my girlfriend had been transformed and twisted into a tall, slim and pale creature, with its eyes being switched to dark holes and it jaw missing from the rest of the head, exposing the inner parts of its throat\nThat was, I thought, something definitely worthy of a demon from a really scary movie \nThat _thing_ was staring at me, observing me, like a predator looking at his prey in those documentaries you watch at the TV \nEven before I process what was going on, I started running. Running like I could never stop, and I think I really couldn't \nAnd that terrible thing continued running after me. It ran like an animal on all fours, using its arms and legs in a primitive, animalistic way. But the semi-human appearance would never let my eyes mistake it for any animal\nI ran away as fast as I could for what seemed like days, weeks, heck maybe even years\nSuddenly I found a place that looked like it was safe\nIt was a small cluster of mountains that had only one entrance/exit. Right in the middle there was a clearing that gave me the sensation that that thing wouldn't follow me here\nHowever, right when I entered it I felt like there was a knife going right through my chest, it was like being betrayed by my own mind\nI _knew_ that if I didn't leave that cursed place really really fast, I would die right then and there\nI tried escaping, I tried running, and I tried to go to that exit from before, but it wasn't there anymore. It was like I couldn't remember where it was\n\nStrangely, I heard the voice of a little boy, saying \"What are you looking for?\" Right behind me\nI slowly turned around only to see something weirdly dread\n_It was a boy_, however he had a face covered in a black smoke, his hands were dirty with some black-looking powder. His clothes were like those old ones you see in photos of England in the 18 hundreds with children that worked in factories. His skin was pale, giving a big contrast with his all-black clothes\nHe stared at me with his head tilted slightly to the left, making him look a bit curious\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, but deep down I already knew the answer \nHe spoke in a tone as if he was almost saddened by those words: \"Our time is over\"\n———————————————————————————————————\nBeep beep beep\nI heard my alarm go off for the third time. I had pass wayy too much from my time to be wake\nThe dream was still in my mind, what was strange, since I usually forget my dream right when I wake up, being a nightmare or not\nThen the word get out of my mouth, without even I wanting it, and I know very well what they mean\nThey are the name of that being, the name of that demon, the name of that horrendous god\n\"Nightmare\"",

        "text": " \n\nHello everyone,\n\nI am posting here because I am in need of some advice. Recently, I went on a camping trip to a secluded campground in the middle of nowhere. I was excited for the adventure, but what I experienced there has left me feeling confused and unsure of what to do next.\n\nWhen I arrived at the campground, I was surprised to find that I was the only one there. I had expected to see other campers, but there was not a soul in sight. It was May and right in the middle of peak season for the park. However I was thankful to have the privacy and I shrugged it off and set up my tent, eager to start exploring.\n\nAs I hiked through the woods, I stumbled upon a strange box that was locked to a tree. It was made of old, weathered wood and had strange symbols etched into it. I tried to open it, but it was sealed tight. I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something sinister about it. I felt something calling me to open it, something dark and dangerous.\n\nAfter returning to my camp and making some dinner I decided to go check out the lake by my campground and watch the sunset. When I got there I noticed the water level had dropped significantly and the shoreline was now much further out than before. The water was murky and the smell of rotting vegetation filled the air. As the sun began to set, I thought I caught a glimpse of something in the water. At first, I thought it was a piece of rotted wood that was exposed by the receding lake level. But the more I looked at it I kept thinking it looked like some kind of deformed creature. it was far enough that I had to squint to see it, and when the wind blew I swear I saw it reach out as if it was beckoning me. But without my glasses I couldn't be sure. I felt a sense of confusion and uncertainty.\n\nThe sun set and I returned to my campsite but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched. At this point I still hadn't seen a single person since I arrived earlier in the day. My campfire burned low and I was too scared to go into the woods looking for more wood so I crawled in the safety of my tent. I tried to sleep, but I kept tossing and turning, my mind racing with thoughts of the strange box and the possible creature in the lake. The darkness of the night seemed to be closing in on me, making me feel trapped and suffocated.\n\nThe next morning, I quickly packed up my things and headed back home. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that I had missed something important. About a half hour into my drive home it hit me that in my haste to pack up, I had forgotten my favorite zippo on the picnic table at my campsite. after a little debating I decided to go back to the campground to quickly grab my lighter.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found that the campground was now bustling with activity. There were other campers, rangers, and even a small store I hadn't seen before. There was no way I was in the same place, the store was almost in eyeshot of my camping site. There were tents pitched on either side of the site I  was at. I figured I must have come back a different way and ended up in a different part of the park. That would explain the store and the people, but as I was turning away the light glistened off something on the picnic table. my stomach knotted up as I realized it was my lighter. There was no doubt this was the exact spot I had been. I walked up to one of the rangers and asked if they knew anything about all my people and when they arrived. The ranger looked at me with a confused expression and said, \"What are you talking about? most of these people have been here since yesterday.\" His eyes shifted and he walked away and got into his truck and drove off. I really got the sense that he was lying to me. I grabbed my lighter and hopped back into my car and sped back to my house.\n\nI am now back home, but I can't shake off the feeling that something is really wrong at that campsite. I don't know if I saw a creature or it was just my imagination. Why was that creepy box locked to a tree in the woods and does it have anything to do with this? I feel like I'm losing my mind. I need some advice on how to cope with this and how to figure out what really happened.",

        "text": "I have a guys’ night with my two best friends, Paul and Serge, that’s been running since we were in our 20s. \n\nOver the years, we’ve traded the PBR for nice wine and the cheap cigarettes for cigars, but the idea is basically the same: we get drunk and talk shit until we get tired and then put on a movie or play video games. Then Paul and I go back to our families, and Serge goes back to his single life.\n\nWe’d been drinking for maybe an hour when I started to feel funny. Not drunk, but actually kind of hyper, like I had a million thoughts racing through my head that I needed to tell someone.\n\n“It’s hitting you,” said Paul. \n\n“I must be losing my tolerance,” I said. I barely drank these days. Too busy with two kids at home and my wife finishing nursing school.\n\nPaul smirked a little. “Not the alcohol,” he said. “The other thing. The thing I added to the decanter. *In vino, veritas!*”\n\n“What the hell are you talking about?” Serge asked, starting to look edgy. \n\nPaul held up a small vial. “Well, I can’t pronounce the actual name of the thing, but it’s basically truth serum. Got it from one of the lab techs in my office. Crazy stuff. It actually works. Also kind of makes you feel like you’re on speed, which is kind of a bonus.”\n\n“This is bullshit,” I said, getting up from the couch. “I’m out of here.”\n\nSerge watched Paul with angry eyes, trying not to say anything. In all our years of friendship, we’d only had a handful of deeper talks. \n\n“Come on,” said Paul, blocking the door. “What’s the problem with a little truth if you’ve got nothing to hide.”\n\n“You want the truth, dude?” I asked. “How about I’m pretty fucking upset that someone I consider to be a friend decided to drug me against my will. Now get out of the way. I’m gonna go sleep this thing off.”\n\n“Not until you tell me if you’re sleeping with Jess,” he said, suddenly much more serious. \n\nI rolled my eyes. I realized it was taking all my willpower not to launch into a long tirade. I was holding in my words like they were piss after a long car ride. They needed to come out. \n\n“Just… just answer me man,” he said, and I could tell he was close to either throwing a punch or breaking down in tears. I’d seen him do both plenty of times over the years. “I just want to know if it’s true. I remember you telling me all the time how hot she was back when we first started dating.”\n\nI tried to bite my tongue. I tasted blood, but it did no good. I *had* to answer him, regardless of the consequences. \n\n“Jess is a trainwreck,” I told him. “She totally ignores your kids, and she treats you like an ATM. I guarantee you she’s cheating with someone, but it’s definitely not me.”\n\nFor a second, everyone was quiet. Then Paul came in for an awkward hug.\n\n“I’m sorry,” said Paul after a few seconds. “I should have known you would never. I mean–shit. I’m sorry. You guys want to dust off the Genesis, maybe go a little retro? I… I’m really sorry. I”\n\nHe started reaching in the cabinet under the TV to look for some of the older consoles.\n\n“I’m a serial killer,” said Serge, all of a sudden. “It’s the first time I’ve said that out loud. I guess I’m not *exactly* sure what I am. I don’t have any kind of particular method. I’ve been doing it since I was in high school. I just look for opportunities. Like my first guy I did: he was just standing on a vista, looking out over the mountains. And I just pushed him off. And I felt like kind of calm release in me for a few minutes after I did it, a kind of peace I’d never felt before.”\n\nPaul and I stared at him, trying to register if what he was saying was real.\n\n“You’re joking,” I said. “Tell us you’re joking.”\n\n“When I joined the army, I thought maybe I could kind of channel it, you know? Kill a few bad guys and feel good about myself. And what happened? Two years of sweating my ass off in the desert. Not in Iraq. Not in Afghanistan. In fucking New Mexico. Not a single whiff of combat. I killed a hitchhiker and two cadets over the course of my time there.”\n\nAs he spoke, he pulled out a hunting knife. I remembered mocking him when he bought it, calling him a mall ninja. Now, I wondered how many people he’d killed with it. My heart was thudding in my ears. I looked around the room for any kind of weapon, but all I saw were XBox controllers and wine glasses.\n\n“Now it’s starting to get worse,” he said, his eyes cold, the knife shaking in his hands. “It’s like I can’t be alone with anyone without thinking about how easy it would be to choke the life out of them. I leave these bars with women, and I wonder if anyone would be able to remember my face if the cops came around asking questions.”\n\n“I’m scared,” said Paul. “I’m really, really fucking scared right now.”\n\n“You should be,” said Serge, trying not to meet his eyes. “I wish you hadn’t given me that drug, Paul. I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel like my life is pretty much over now. I don’t like killing people I know. It’s the easiest way to get caught. And you guys are my best friends. The only people I care about in the whole world.”\n\n“I’m terrible at keeping secrets,” said Paul, unable to contain himself. “I’ll call the police as soon as I leave this room. You know how I am.”\n\n“I know,” said Serge.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, Paul picked up his wineglass and tried to smash it against Serge’s head. He missed completely, tumbling over the couch. I almost wanted to laugh. But then I looked down and saw the knife sticking out the side of Paul’s head. Serge had stuck him right in the temple. \n\nSerge removed the knife in one swift motion, even as Paul’s body continued to twitch involuntarily on the floor. Serge was crying now as he wiped the blood from the knife with his shirt.\n\n“Look what you made me do,” he said, looking down at Paul. “Idiot. I should have known he’d try something like this.” Then, he looked over at me, tears streaking down his face. “Now what?” he asked.\n\n“I can’t die,” I said. “Think of my girls.”\n\n“I know,” he said. “I know. But I have to kill you. I have to.”\n\nHe took a step toward me, and as I did I looked down and saw this last little glimmer of life in Paul’s eyes. As Serge tried to step over him to get to me, Paul grabbed his foot, and Serge tripped. \n\n*Run,* Paul mouthed. \n\nAnd I did. As I tore out the front door and into the dark street, I heard Serge screaming behind me, *“I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!”*\n\nIt’s been about a week since everything went down, and I just got back from Paul’s funeral. The whole time, I was looking over my shoulder, waiting for Serge to show up. Maybe he was there and I just didn’t see him.\n\nAt night, I check the locks a dozen times, and watch the feeds from my new security cameras on my phone. So far, so good.\n\nBased on what Serge told us that night, he’s not prone to taking crazy risks. He called himself opportunistic. But maybe that’s what scares me the most. Because when he yelled out that he was going to kill me, he was still on the serum. He was telling the truth.\n\nAnd I know someday, I’ll be standing on the curb, waiting for a bus or an Uber, and I’ll suddenly feel a pair of hands behind me, pushing me forward to my doom. \n\nWhen I get these dark thoughts at night, I sit up in bed, sweating and holding my knees, and my wife tries to hold me and tell me it’ll be okay. She brushes her hands softly against my hair, and says, *They’ll catch him, baby. You’re going to be here for a long, long time with me.

        "text": "(First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/109lb0u)\n\nAfter Sunny moved into my place, I got worried it might be too cramped with the two of us. My other bedroom was only slightly bigger than a closet. It had enough space for a bed and a dresser. Not much else. Turns out, Sunny didn’t need a lot of space.  \n\nInstead of sleeping in a bed, he bought a large glass bowl. I had no idea what it was meant for until I knocked on his door to ask if he wanted me to make breakfast that day. When he didn’t answer after a few loud knocks, I got worried., I opened the door hoping I wasn’t invading his privacy to see the glass bowl full of a transparent liquid with an orange orb floating in the middle. His species lost their shape as they slept. So, I didn’t even need to buy him a bed before he moved in. \n\nI also got worried he might be bored staying inside all day. Sometimes he would put on a ring that made him appear human to hit up the thrift shops for clothing. The disguise bothered him making it hard to stay out for very long though. He described the magic making his human appearance made him feel as if he was wearing a full-body wet suit that was about two sizes too small.\n\nOne day before I left the house for work, Sunny met me by the door wearing nicely ironed dressed pants and a buttoned-down shirt. He didn’t care about what gender the clothing was made for. He just wore whatever he wanted. He looked very nice in the outfit and I didn’t realize why he might have dressed fancy for a reason.  \n\n“I'm going to work with you today. I have an interview.” Sunny told me as he held out my snack for the day.\n\nMy stomach dropped at the words. I knew he was bored being cooped up all day, but I didn’t think Sunny delivering mail was a good idea. He cried if he needed to move a spider out of the apartment. I didn’t think he could handle any dangerous monsters one might come across on the job. He noticed my expression and corrected himself.\n\n“I’ll be in the sorting room. They’re lacking help in that area and want to hire more people just for that job. They hope I can replace someone who can spend time in the field instead.” He told me.\n\nThat made more sense. I’ve done a few shifts in the sorting room. It was one of the safer jobs someone could get. And there would be monsters Sunny could make friends with. I doubted he wanted to spend all his time with me for the rest of his life. Sunny explained Rufus gave him a cheap phone to keep in contact. He and Max sent messages and had been the one to arrange the job idea. I didn’t have a clue when the idea was even suggested.\n\nWe went to work together. I needed to show Sunny the way to the sorting room before starting my shift. We made the short trip to the large open room filled with packages and letters. It was pretty hectic that day. I worried a little that this job might be a bit much for Sunny right off the bat. He might get too overwhelmed with so many people around.\n\nBelizas noticed us right away and came over. I’ve never seen her do any work in the sorting room. She just showed up to bother people. A sly grin came across her face seeing the person I brought with me. She and Sunny hadn’t met yet and I didn’t know what to expect.\n\n“I heard you got one of those creatures. I didn’t think you were the type. Are you having fun living together?” She said in a suggestive tone with arms crossed.\n\nI knew Belizas acted annoying but that comment got me pissed at her. I wasn’t even this mad when she ate my arm. Sunny’s face fell and I got in front of him to snap at her.\n\n“Don’t you dare imply that sort of thing about Sunny. His species might be used like that, but that doesn’t mean you can assume things about all of them.” I said, face getting a bit hot.\n\nHer face fell into an uneasy smile. It wasn’t often someone got angry at her for the stupid stuff she said.\n\n“It was just a joke.” She replied trying to defend herself.\n\n“It wasn’t funny. It was rude. You should apologize to him.” I said, still a bit heated.\n\nA few creatures stopped working to watch this exchange. I knew I was embarrassing my roommate but I held my ground. Belizas scratched the back of her head, fidgeting trying to get out of what she needed to say.\n\n“Sorry.” She said in a small voice. Her face cleared up ready to move past the whole thing. “When are you going to have another sleepover? I want to try to punch a ghost in the face again. I think I messed up last time because I didn’t punch hard enough.”\n\nI wanted to correct her saying that really wouldn’t work. Max came over making us focus on him instead of Belizas’s impossible goals. He stopped near Sunny unaware of what kind of conversation he walked into.\n\n“I’ve been assigned to show Sunny around today since I already know him. I’m pretty sure he’ll get the job after the interview today so we’ll be hanging out.” Max explained.\n\nSunny relaxed a little now that he knew he would be around someone he trusted. He tensed up again when Max reached over to hug Sunny and pressed his face against a transparent cheek. He honestly loved hugging the slime boy because of the squishy feeling. I understood why he liked it but I found myself frowning again. My roommate looked uncomfortable. He did like giving out hugs so Max might not understand Sunny might not feel like being touched without any warning.\n\n“Max, you should ask Sunny if you can hug him first. He might not like being suddenly grabbed.” I told him.\n\nMax pulled away, feeling a bit embarrassed he wasn’t aware of that fact. He apologized and Sunny forgave him right away. My roommate mouthed a small thank you in my direction. With that settled, I wondered what my day would hold.\n\n“If you’re going to be with Sunny today then who am I going to be working with? Is Belizas going to be my partner today?” I asked.\n\n“No way. Unlike you losers, I got a hot date. See ya!” She sharply said.\n\nBelizas walked backward a few steps showing off what I assumed to be insulting hand gestures. She tripped over her own feet and I turned back to Max ignoring her cries of pain from landing on her elbow wrong.\n\n“You have someone waiting for you in the meeting room. I think you’ve met before. We need to get started so we’ll see you at the end of the day.” Max said turning to leave.\n\nHe offered Sunny a hand instead of just reaching over. I watched them leave wondering if Sunny would be alright. He was pretty shy when in a room with more than three people. I just needed to trust him and if it turned out he couldn’t do this job then we would both start looking for something else that suited him better.\n\nI found my way back to the Zero room. Two people waited in the room for me. I slipped the usual gift over to Max’s step-sister and then looked over at my partner for the day. We had met before but rarely spoke. It was my understanding he worked as a supervisor in the sorting room. He looked like a mummy. His entire body was covered in aged wrappings over top of shrivelled flesh. A set of glowing blue eyes shine in empty sockets. His mouth was exposed, showing peeled-back lips and a mouth full of needle shape teeth. He wore a uniform jacket over his wrappings and nothing else. I hated to admit it, but the combination made him look a bit stylish.\n\n“This is An’k. He’ll be working with you today.” Susan said gesturing to the other monster. Or was her name Sara?\n\nI took the small box from her ready to head out. My partner for the day didn’t speak. He just took the lead with his long thin legs. With his appearance, I should have expected what kind of place the delivery would take us. He opened the door and I needed to block my face with my arm from the hot wind blowing in puffs of sand.\n\nI followed behind into a hot orange desert. Sand as far as the eye could see. When I adjusted to the intense sunlight, I saw a clear sign this dessert wasn’t normal. The blue cloudless sky wasn’t empty. Massive upside-down pyramids floated, some with newer white blocks and others nearly corroded away. I stopped in my tracks; mouth open at the sight. My shoes sank to the ankles in the sand. The sun would have cooked me alive if I wasn’t wearing my uniform. An’k gave me a few moments to take everything in.\n\nI tried to start moving again finding it difficult. Each step a chore. He took a few steps forwards and then needed to stop and wait for me. My shoes filled with sand I knew would track and stay in my apartment. I struggled like that for a few feet until An’k gave up waiting. He walked over and easily picked me up. I let out a yelp of surprise as he tossed me over his shoulder to swiftly start walking toward the only pyramid on the ground. His feet crossed over the sand leaving no footprints behind.\n\nThe entire walk felt mortifying. At least he didn’t say anything or call attention to needed to carry a weak human. It didn’t take long for us to arrive at a stone doorway. A heavy slab sealing the entrance An’k opened by placing a palm inside an indent. An almost mechanical click came from the stone. Instead of it opening in any way I expected. The entire slab flickered away as if it was a hologram.\n\nWe walked inside and I got put down on the even stone floor. The door came back behind us cutting off the sunlight. It took me a few minutes to adjust to the low light. The main room we just walked into had a ceiling so high I couldn’t see the top. Massive stone pillars lined the room with small torches set into the stone. An’k walked over to take the simple metal torch with a flickering blue light at the end. Again, I expected the light to be fire, but it flickered in a digital-looking way. Each movement of An’ks hand left behind stray pixels for half a second.\n\nWe weren’t in Kansas anymore, that was for sure. I let him lead the way deeper into the darkness. So far so good. We quickly covered the distance of the large dark room. I felt a chill in the air that my uniform didn’t keep away. Every time I hoped for an easy job, I never got my wish.\n\nI followed An’k into a long hallway with countless doors on each side. Most of the doorways were blocked by stone. The open rooms were so dark it wasn’t possible to see what was inside. When we passed by the dark openings, a faint whisper of air followed behind us. I refused to turn my head to try and find the source. I just focused on our footsteps and not the other hints of other sounds in the dark.\n\nFinally, my co-worker stopped in front of a door. He opened it and wasted no time going inside. I regretfully kept on his heels. The room was large but then narrowed off into a tight hallway with only our blue light showing the way. In some spots, I needed to walk sides ways to get through. The rough stone walls pressed down on my chest through my uniform. I needed to cut back on Sunny’s cooking if I had more jobs like this. Another sound came from behind us that I did my best to ignore. A crunching mixed in with scuttling. I didn’t like it. It put my nerves on end making me think I might step on something unpleasant.\n\nWe arrived in a bigger room with three more doorways on the other side. An’k hadn’t even looked at me since we started walking. I knew he wasn’t a big of a talker and even doubted he knew English. He paused and raised a hand to make me stop moving. We might not speak the same language but could communicate. I followed his gaze upwards seeing nothing but blackness.\n\nThe sounds I heard in the hallway grew louder. At first, I thought my eyes adjusted to the dark, but then I realized the dark started to move as the sounds grew louder. I wasn’t able to see what crawled on the ceiling. An’k suddenly grabbed my wrist to drag me along. I didn’t need much encouragement. A let out a scream when a thing thudded on my shoulder. I got a look at it before it fell off. A massive centipede came falling from the roof. I heard more insects falling to the ground behind us. A scarab-looking bug fell after the centipede and I needed to shake that one off. The bastard went right for my ear. I bet it wanted to eat my brain in the easiest way possible.\n\nAn’k had no issue running through the long tight stone hallway. I kept up with him but suddenly the space got too enclosed. I struggled to fit through, but my chest refused to budge. An’k’s hand slipped off my wrist for a second. He turned back to pull on my arm without any luck. He took the box we needed to deliver from my hand he pulled on to tuck it under his arm. After a few wasted attempts to free me, our eyes met. I knew exactly what he was thinking.\n\nWhen I first met Max, I asked why mailmen worked in pairs. He joked that you just needed to be faster than your partner. An’k could finish this job if he left me behind. The bugs would be slowed down by eating through my body. My uniform was unable to protect me from that fate.\n\nI wanted to be mad at him. He gave the idea some thought and I knew he regretted his choice. My pulse raced at the thought of being eaten alive, but what could he even do? I gave him a nod, bracing to watch him leave me alone in the dark.\n\nHe took a few steps down the hallway, torch in hand. Then made a sound of frustration and came back to me.\n\n“I’m stuck, I don't think-” I started.\n\nHe took my hand and I felt an odd pull in my chest. It was as if all the air left my body. With some effort, he slammed his palm against the wall, and the stone shifted, collapsing into sand. He then yanked me forwards just in time to get away from bugs nipping at my heels. He needed to half drag me down the rest of the hallway. \n\nWe stumbled out into another large room. The torch dropped from his hand as he used both to keep me on my feet. I hadn’t recovered from whatever he did before. Countless bugs came swarming through the hallway opening, crawling up towards the ceiling in a hoard. We needed to keep moving but my legs shook too much to even take a step.\n\nAnother pull came from my chest. An’k guided me to my knees and stood behind me. His blue eyes blazing in the dark and his hands outstretched. One of the stone pillars collapsed into sand but it didn’t all drop to the ground. Instead, the sand turned into a sea An’k guide along with his hands. The hoard of bugs made their move. So many of them jumped down in an attempt to devour us. The sand An’k created slammed into their bodies, blasting them against the hard walls. No matter how many he crushed in that way, more kept pouring through the hallway and he was running out of sand.\n\nI didn’t know what he took from me to use his power. I didn’t know if I even had much left in me for us to fight. His hands came down on my shoulders as cold phantom hands started to root through my chest looking for something. I wanted to fight against it but knew I needed to give him anything he wanted to keep us both alive. A flash of a memory came. One of Max and Sunny laughing about a stupid joke only they understood. The hands grabbed a hold of the light feeling that memory produced in my chest and pulled it out.\n\nI looked up just in time to see An’k make two sweeping motions of his arms. A rumble came that overpowered the sounds of the insects. From around us came a sea of sand that flooded the entire room beside the small space where we stood. It all pushed through the small hallway opening fully pushing back the dangerous bugs to where they came from and killing a great deal in the process. The sea of sand was so powerful it cracked the stone around the hallway door.\n\nWhen the sand settled An’k wavered on his feet but still stood. I looked around the room now covered in a foot of sand and the hallway was completely full. For some reason, a rush of excitement came through me. I stood up, face flushed to take An’ks thin hands.\n\n“That was awesome!” I said in a tone Max might have used.\n\nMaybe we’ve been working together too much. I quickly let go of my co-worker's hands knowing I made him uncomfortable.\n\n“Awe... some...?” An’k said, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nI've never heard him speak before. I almost thought he couldn’t. I nodded and repeated myself.\n\n“Yeah, you’re awesome. Like, really cool, you know?”\n\nThat wouldn't make much sense if he didn’t know English. I think he understood the concept of the word. For a moment, his face held some pride under the wrappings. He quickly composed himself again so we could keep moving. Thankfully, we did not come across any more bugs. Only a few traps like arrows barely missing my face because An’k pulled me out of the way in time.\n\nThe room where we needed to deliver the box was the largest one yet. Unlike the other empty ones, this one was filled with organized boxes of gems stones and gold. Most stones carved in the shape of some sort of insect. I expected some of them to start crawling around because they appeared so real. The room was bright from the blue flames reflecting off all the precious stones.\n\nA creature walked around when we entered. It looked sort of human, similar to An’k. The creature was at least eight feet tall, bone thin, and dressed in layers of tattered wrappings. A golden large headpiece covered most of the creature’s face. Out from the back wriggled what I saw to be long centipedes shining like jade flowing down the monster’s back. An’k walked right over and handed over the box. The cardboard looked very out of place in this room. The creature quickly signed the delivery paper and he and An’k started to quickly talk in a language I didn’t know. Both of their voices were low and raspy.\n\nThey didn’t speak for very long. An’k made short work of creating a doorway back to the Zero room which made me very happy. The tall creature gestured for me to come over to it. My stomach flipped but I thought it would be rude to refuse. He grabbed a bag that looked to be made of woven golden threads then turned to one of the boxes to start filling it with gold scarabs. He handed me the overfilled bag and I nearly couldn’t carry it. I didn’t know what to say or how to act. Creatures didn’t often just give out gifts like this.\n\n“Um, awesome, thank you.” I said unsure if that was the correct response.\n\nAn’k nodded so I guessed I was in the clear. I gave the creature another thanks and followed my co-worker through the door back to the office. The trip was not overly long but I still felt worn out. We reported in and found out we didn’t have another job for the day. Time was weird when we worked. It might have only felt like an hour or two but we’d been gone for an entire workday.\n\nI wanted to see if I could find Sunny but he found me. He and Max came into the room because they knew what time I would be back at. I’d placed the bag of golden scarabs on the floor unsure of what to do with them. If I sold them, Sunny would not need to live in a cramped room anymore. But it felt really weird to sell a gift. I thought about how much my father needed the money as well, my will wavering.\n\n“I'm so jealous you guys got to go on that job! It’s a bit dangerous though so most people don’t like to take the assignment.” Max said, his tail slightly wagging.\n\nAll jobs were good jobs to him.\n\n“An’k was awesome. He pretty much didn’t need me.” I told them. \n\nAn’k had a bit of pride on his face for a few seconds. I think he really liked that compliment. I turned to Sunny because I could see he had something he wanted to say but was too shy to do so.\n\n“You got the job, right? How was the day? Did you make friends?” I asked him what made my roommate brighten up.\n\nHe told me about how much Max helped him out and how he really like Gary, the pile of moving mushrooms in the sorting room. I didn’t know the mushrooms had a name. We quickly got caught up on the day’s events. I noticed Max kept looking down at the bag I brought back.\n\n“Can... I have one of those...? Or maybe two?” He asked when he got caught staring.\n\nThat was odd of him. Max never asked for money. I didn’t think he was even concerned about it. I handed over two golden scarabs and his face turned into a smile I’ve only seen him have when I hand him food. Then both bugs went into his mouth with a loud crunch\n\n“I rarely get to eat these!” Max said very happy over his little treat.\n\n“They’re honey scarabs.” Sunny explained when he noticed my confusion.\n\nWell, there went my rich lifestyle. I handed a bug to Sunny who happily ate it. And then to An’k who also got excited about the treat. They all said the bugs tasted great but I wasn’t ready to try one just yet. An’k needed to get back to the sorting room to work, and I asked him to take the bag of scarabs to share with everyone working. I let Max and Sunny take a few more before he left.\n\nI nearly died yet again, but at least I made a new friend. Since I didn’t have another delivery job, I wanted to head home. Max tagged along with us to mooch a meal. He loved Sunny’s cooking as much as I did. I swore I wanted to cut down on overeating but in the end, we all ate so much that we couldn’t move much after dinner. We put off the dishes until tomorrow morning. Max didn’t feel like heading home so we made a blanket fort for us all to sleep on the floor.  I don’t care if we were all adults. Sometimes you just need to make a blanket fort with friends after a long day.\n\nAside from the desert of sand I brought back from the job, and nearly getting eaten alive the day wasn’t too bad.",

        "text": "When I was a teenager my parents divorced. Nothing special. Happens all the time. My dad was quick to put distance between my mom and me, moving a state away. Though he had the legal right to see me once a month, he opted not to deal with the drive. Instead, I stayed at his house for a month each summer.\n\nIt wasn’t my favorite time of the year. He lived in a small Midwestern town where I knew no one and had little to do. I spent most of my time riding his old bike along the decommissioned railroad tracks and skipping rocks through a muddy creek. The only portion of the whole affair I looked forward to was the drive there and back.\n\n\nAbout midway between my mom and my dad, on a lonely stretch of highway that cut like a scythe through the golden fields of wheat, was a truck stop. Not just any truck stop. This was the *World’s Largest Truck Stop*. Even as a teenager, I doubted the veracity of that claim. How could *anything* in the Midwest be the largest of something? Surely there was nothing so notable in this vast, rusted land.\n\nBut it *was* big. There was a laundromat and a bar and a dentist. There was a massive store that stocked a massive array of glittering chrome truck accessories. It had rows of audio books and an entire wall filled with wolf and wizard shirts. I always begged my dad for one on the way back. And that’s how I ended up with a small collection of hyper-detailed wildlife and fantasy tees.\n\nOf course, there was also an enormous public restroom. There must have been at least twenty stalls. Despite it’s tourist-baiting pedigree, this truck stop wasn’t particularly well-kept. There was a thin veneer of grime over everything. The floors were constant swirls of dirt and red gravel. The bathrooms weren’t much better: there were always pools of still water on the wall-length counter-tops and collecting in corners. And no one ever seemed to locate the garbage, leaving their crumpled paper towels strewn about the floor where they blew around like tumbleweed.\n\nNaturally, like any grungy bathroom, there was a wide variety of graffiti coating the stall walls”. \n\nThere were the old classics like “Jesus Saves” (and underneath, “But he can’t save me from gas station burritos.”) and “I hate vandalism.” A “Hail Satin” scribbled around a crude pentagram (and I don’t think they meant to worship the fabric). And every manner of dick you could ever imagine. Big ones. Short ones. Veiny ones. Girthy ones. Stick figures with penises for heads. Or penis guns. And on and on. \n\nWhen I went out to my dad’s that first summer, I was firmly engrossed in my “edgy” phase and was eager to add my own infantile message to the rest. I picked a middle stall that was relatively devoid of art and wrote directly on the door at eye-level, so that anyone sitting down would immediately see my chicken scratch. That was prime real estate.\n\nAt the time, the thing at the forefront of my mind was a bully at my school: *Arnold*. He was the type of person who would go out of his way to find me during a passing period, just so he could knock the books out of my arms. The type of person who deliberately aimed at heads in dodgeball, and whipped his throws as hard as possible.\n\nWhat a prick.\n\nSo I took out my black Sharpie and wrote my own classic: “For a good time call Arnold at [Phone number redacted].” Like a truly resentful ball of angst, I put his actual home phone number.\n\nThen I was gone and forgot all about it until the end of my month with my dad. On the way back, I used the restroom and recalled what I had written. Of course, I was excited to see if my lewd message had attracted any replies. Back then, bathroom wall graffiti was like a sort of cringe-inducing public square: a place for all manner of perverse and childish discourse.\n\nBelow my message, in red ink was a reply: “I called but no one answered.”\n\nI chuckled to myself. Back then, I really did hope that someone had called him. He deserved nothing less for his cruel behavior.\n\n I could have left things there, but I couldn’t help my desire to egg things on. So, I wrote something I greatly regret: “Why don’t you give him a visit? He’s always happy to have company. [Address Redacted].”\n\n***\n\nWhen the school year started, I didn’t notice that Arnold wasn’t around until one of my friend’s pointed it out to me. It was a welcome relief. We figured that his parents had moved east to one of the larger cities. Our town was midsized but slowly dying. It wouldn’t be the first or last time we loss a classmate to that long exodus. Jonesboro is a shadow of its former self these days, but that’s a story for another time.\n\nI didn’t think about Arnold again until the following summer, when I was once again on the long drive to my dad’s. We stopped at the *World’s Largest Truck Stop* and, after perusing the selection of salty snacks, I used the restroom. \n\nAs soon as I set foot on those cracked and yellowed square tiles, I remembered my stall door conversation. I quickly located that middle stall, locked the door behind me and sat down. \n\nThere was a new message, written in the same hand and with the same red marker: “Thanks for the tip. I got the best head of my life :)”\n\nSomething about the message unnerved me. It was just as crass and immature as anything you’d expect to see there. I mean, on the right-hand wall of the stall someone had scrawled the message “Jessica’s mom has huge tits” above a crude rendering of the apparent mother in question. I think it was the smiley-face that felt weird to me. Like it really was a genuine nod of appreciation. \n\nThat and the penmanship was oddly perfect. Whoever was writing those messages lacked the unsteady, jagged hand of everyone else. Their script was comprised of perfect lines and pristine curves. It seemed out of place next to the other harried scribbles.\n\nI don’t know what it was that possessed me, but I wrote again, just beneath their message, “I’m sure he’d do it for you anytime.”\n\nThat summer visit was another relatively uneventful one—aside from meeting my dad’s new girlfriend, who was surprisingly pleasant. Of course, I was too immature to appreciate her efforts then and spent much of my time brooding alone.\n\nOn the quiet ride home, we stopped at the truck stop once more. Back in the restroom. It was a little odd, but I got a little thrill wondering whether there would be a response and what it might be. When I sat down this time, though, I felt my stomach churn.\n\n“Arnold’s all used up. Need someone new. What about you? :)”\n\nThere was a clacking of metal in the stall next to mine. The unbuckling of a belt. I nearly jumped out of my skin. This time I didn’t write a response. It was starting to feel too personal. I booked it out of that restroom without looking back. I was in such a rush that I didn’t even snag the black bear shirt I had decided to grab for a souvenir. I locked myself in my dad’s truck and waited. Didn’t utter a word the rest of the way home.\n\n***\n\nIt was in October that a fisherman pulled a headless torso from the Sangamon River. It was that same month that I found out Arnold hadn’t moved. He had been missing for over a year. To people that cared, it was big news when he disappeared. But not a lot of people cared.\n\nThey never did find the head. Nor the killer. So, no one could definitively say it was Arnold’s body. I imagine it’s still sitting in a morgue somewhere, waiting for the final piece of the puzzle. Of course, I know it’s him. It has to be.\n\nAnd me? Well, I didn’t go back to my dad’s the next summer. I blamed it on his new girlfriend. Told him I didn’t want to be around them. I regret that too. But I couldn’t tell him or my mom the truth. I couldn’t tell them I wasn’t going back because—even if we didn’t stop at that truck stop—I was terrified of who might be watching me. Looking back, it seems irrational. But I realized later that the address I provided wasn’t even Arnold’s. Right house number, wrong street. And so I wondered how they found him. \n\nAnd, even more, I wondered who else I might have condemned…",

        "text": "It stinks everywhere. It's coming from downstairs but i can't even be up in ny room without being aware of it. Its numbing all my senses at this point. I run down holding my breath, catch some bread or something from the kitchen and dash back over here. Take a bite, gag, puke in the toilet. Its just the horrible smell. Its even in the food ffs. I quite enjoy food otherwise. I must eat afterall.  Yesterday's rotten spaghetti floats on the water, worm-like. \n\nIts 7pm. I'm so hungry. I feel faint. Guess I'll just drink water for dinner today. Again. I didn't want to bother the neighbours w the godawful stink so I blocked out all openings in doors and windows with wet cloth. I walk downstairs to do the usual spraying them with this baking soda and vinegar solution thing. I'm not sure it its working. I can't go out either. Awesome. \n\n\"I'm stuck in here with you. Do you hear me??\" I throw a small browning slice of apple left on the kitchen counter for god knows how long, at mum. It did a most delightful landing right in the gaping hole I perfectly carved out into her pot belly the other day. \"If only you could see how pretty you are now you'd never want to look like me again, mum. Or how I used to. You look like 20years younger! You are very, very pretty. The girls at school would agree.\"\n\nI wasn't always like this. I was so lovely. Daddy always said so. But when he was gone she fed me so much. And ate twice the amount. All that disgusting overfried burnt fat shit.  \"They say mean things to me at school mum!! Everyone is always looking at me!!\" \"If they look at you pluck their eyes out, ok? You look pretty my little sweet. Btw I  heated pizza for dinner. You must eat\". So I ate. I became gross like her. I honestly can't look at myself without punching my reflection in the mirror. Mum used to have no mirror in her room. But she has mine now. \n\n\"You were the problem. This was all you\" I say, sobbing between gulps of water now. \"You made me like this!!!\" I walk over to her and bare hand shove out handfuls of intestine onto the floor. It smells so foul i wanna die. I smear her face in all that black green red crap. I look at her reflection in the mirror i put on the other side.  \"You look just like the horrid shit you ate and fed me. CAN YOU SEE THAT MUM?! I lied, you'll never be pretty!!!!\" \n\nI sit down with the same kitchen knife now beside mum, holding her hand. It is soft, like when she was still here. \"I love you so much, I'm sorry, I'm sorry\" I hate myself so much. Sobbing, I grasp it firmly in hand. I need to do this now. I need to. My whole belly by now is covered in experimental jabs and scratches by my ameture self, not knowing how best to do it. I can't keep putting this off much longer you know? I just need to be strong now.",

        "text": "So I think I should start by telling you all that I’m just a normal guy in a dead end job and no real friends or family to brag about but my whole life changed a year ago and this is what happened.\n\nIt was a normal Friday evening and I was on my way home from work when I came across some roadworks that meant I had to follow a diversion round, it was pretty dark and as I was following the road I got a flat tire which is exactly what I wanted after a stressful week at work. I got out the car and started changing my tyre when I caught a glint of something shiny in the light from my iPhone, I went and looked and saw a single key so me being me I picked it up and put it in my pocket.\n\nThe rest of that evening was uneventful as I changed the tyre and made my way home. The next morning I got up just before midday and made my coffee and sat on my table, then I remembered the key and grabbed it to have a better look and see if I could find anything that would help me locate the owner. When I took a better look I could see it was a very old looking key with no real identifying marks so set it on the table whilst finishing my coffee. Later that afternoon I grabbed the key and purely out of boredom had put it in the lock of my basement door and turned it, to my surprise I heard the locking mechanism engage so went to open the door to see if it really had unlocked the door.\n\nAs I opened the door I stood there in utter shock and amazement, on the other side of the door was a vast city landscape not unlike the city I lived in yet with subtle differences here and there. I wish I could tell you I shut the door and didn’t think of it anymore but come on what person in there right mind wouldn’t want to see what in the world was going on. So I let my curiosity win and I stepped through the door grabbing the key as I closed the door behind me.\n\nThis city was beautiful and huge and so familiar so I stopped someone and asked them where I am which got me a weird look and a brush off which only afterwards I realised was because a sane person would ask where they were, so I decided to find a ship or newspaper stand to grab a paper and find out where I was from there. I found a newspaper stand and grabbed a local paper and was shocked to see I was in my own city yet it couldn’t be as there was stuff that didn’t make sense like shops that I had never heard of or buildings that I had never noticed before.\n\nBefore I would start panicking I thought to myself if this was my city then I could make my way home as I have done thousands of times from the city. I have to say that it took me longer than I would have liked to find my way home but when you see roads that don’t exist or signs that make no sense whatsoever you have to go on instinct. That aside when I finally got to my house I realised that I did t have my door keys on me as in my stupidity because I went through the basement door my brain decided they were not needed. Now luckily for me I get on really well with my neighbour and we actually have a spare set of each other’s keys in case of emergencies.\n\nI knocked on my neighbours door and a stranger answered so I told them who I was and if I could speak to the owner of the house as I had locked myself outside. This person looked me up and down and said if I don’t leave they will call the police, I tried to explain to them the situation again but they shouted something that made no sense “I’ve lived here for 30 years alone and the owner of the house next door is an old man who looks nothing like you so go or the police will be called”\n\nI decided I was either going crazy or something wasn’t right about where I was, I then remembered the key and thought why don’t I just go back to that door in the city and go through that back to my home. So I made my way back to the city and what felt like forever I finally found the door I came through. I put the key in the lock and before I turned it I noticed something that knocked me clear off my feet in shock. I caught a glimpse of a TV in a shop window of the president given a speech but this wasn’t the president I knew, this wasn’t even a politician I recognised. This made no sense but I wanted to go home so I turned the key and ran through the door and slammed it shut.\n\nI took a deep breath then looked into the room properly when I dropped to my knees in disbelief, this wasn’t my house I was now in some store with people staring at me as I brushed away a tear from my face. A nice woman came up to me and asked if I was ok to which I said I was fine just felt a bit under the weather. I got up and asked her if I could use the bathroom to which she happily agreed. Whilst in the bathroom I used the key on the door again and looked through and to my utter amazement I saw a vast landscape where the rest of the store should have been, I closed the door and took the key out to get a proper look at it but just as before it looked like a normal old key.\n\nI put it back in the lock and opened the door again to help get my head around what I saw but noticed this time there was a living room on the other side. I closed the door again and reopened it and to my amazement a completely different landscape once again. It then hit me that each time the door opened it was to somewhere new. So I opened it one more time and walked through not knowing that this time I wasn’t alone.\n\nThis time I was in a busy shopping mall so I decided to walk around and try and make sense of what was happing when I was grabbed and dragged into an empty room by something, I was screaming for help and slowly came to realise this room had no doors and one big mirror. I was sweating and trying to rack my brain for a logical answer when suddenly a man dressed in a black suit said to me “it’s not often we come across your kind messing with things they don’t understand but I will make this as clear as possible. You will not leave this room alive before telling me everything you know about that key!”\n\nI felt a wave of fear envelop me as I looked at him, it was then I realised he wasn’t a man or even human but I couldn’t quite put my finger on what it was. You see it was the same shape as a man and was wearing that suit but it’s face was all fuzzy and not the fun kind. Have you ever had your TV on a channel not picking up a signal and you get that weird black and white static well that’s the best I can describe it’s face because whatever it was my brain clearly couldn’t comprehend.\n\nWhilst in the room with this thing I tried my best to answer any questions it posed to me all the while trying to figure a way out of this hell. One question I do remember as I found it odd yet strangely informative was. “From what we can tell you originated from dimension zeta456 and somehow have ended up in dimension Omega249, How have you managed to cross dimensional boarders without prior authorisation?” It then hit me in that question that this creature has no idea about the key so I started to answer as best I could whilst casually feeling the outside of my pocket, I was in shock the key was still there, in fact everything was still in my pockets including my very phone on which I’m writing this.\n\nI tried not to show my excitement as I answered more questions, that was until it grabbed me and started stabbing me with what I can only describe as some sort of knife but unlike a normal knife this thing had lights and a display. The creature managed to stab me 3 times all along my left arm before I grabbed the weird knife thing and ran towards the window and thrusted the blade into the bottom left corner shattering the glass. I noticed the mall on the other side and leaped over with blood pouring down my arm and dripping on the floor.\n\nI managed to find a door and quickly inserted the key and particularly jumped to the other side, I then continued for maybe another 20 times of opening the door jumping through, closing, reopening and then running through. In my mind I was putting as many dimensions between me and that thing as possible. I say 20 times but it could be more or less I really can’t remember as I wasn’t thinking straight from the shock of what had happened and the pain in my arm. Once I stopped walking through the last door I decided I had to try and get medical help for my arm so started to walk through the tiny village the last door had brought me to.\n\nI managed to see a few people so asked where the nearest hospital or doctors office was to which I was fortunate enough to be directed just a couple of streets away. Once I got to the doctors office I walked in and by this time the blood had soaked through my clothes and was clearly visible, the receptionist quickly messaged the doctor who came out and rushed me into a room with a hospital looking bed and medical looking equipment. I say medical looking as this was certainly not any equipment I recognised from my dimension but regardless I needed help so thought nothing of it.\n\nThe doctor started patching me up with this strange device that stitched the wounds together with nothing but little laser lights, I was amazed but kept calm as I needed this quite badly. Once all was done the doctor asked me some basic questions like my name and address and any medical history. I lied as best I could and was desperate to find a way out as I still wanted to put more doors between me and the creature as possible. I asked the doctor if I could use the bathroom quick to which he looked at me puzzled, I rephrased my question and this time said I needed to pee so could he point me in the direction of the toilet. The doctor still confused from my question stood up and asked if I had also hit my head.\n\nAt this point I was so confused but anxious to get away that I decided to run and as I was running through the village it was then and only then after I saw the doctors face to my question that I noticed the village had no food shops anywhere. I stopped running after about 15 minutes and approached an elderly looking woman and asked where I could get something to eat and drink, but to my amazement the same look of confusion covered her face as it did the doctor. I tried to ask her how they survive without eating and how do they get energy. I wish I hadn’t asked because it was at this point the lady laughed and said “silly child trying to confuse an old woman, I will show you how we get our energy.”\n\nThe woman then looked to the sky and to my horror her face opened to reveal a huge looking flower, I gasped and looked on in disgust but also curiosity. It was when I was looking at her that I noticed something in the background something all to familiar yet more terrifying that the strange flower lady. The creature that grabbed me was watching me and slowly walking towards us, I ran but this creature kept coming and seemed to always keep up yet always walking. I quickly opened a door and ran through but this dimension held horrors to which I will never recover all whilst also running from this creature. Little did I know how drastic my life would change after our second encounter.",

        "text": "  \n\nI didn't realise until years later why my father had been trying to kill me so desperately when I was only eight years old.\n\nIn fact, I mostly forgot what had happened. Or at least, I tried to.\n\nOnce in a while, for no reason at all, a memory of his sudden hard push on the swing would come back to me, so vivid that I could feel his hands on my back, as strong and sharp as that day we were in the playground together. I remember how my tiny body was flung up high high high into the blue sky, higher than it had ever been, leaving the swing as gravity tugged my arms, swooping in an arc and then falling, tumbling by the green leaves and grass and sunlight. I remember thinking I had turned into a bird.\n\nThen the terrible thud as I hit the spongey playground gravel.\n\nThen I heard my dad calling me \"Are you ok? Jennie?\"\n\nI staggered to my feet. “I’m ok dad!” I called, not wanting him to feel upset. He had seemed upset recently.\n\nI saw the look in his eyes. I didn’t have the words for it then, but they were sparking angry. I knew he was hoping I couldn’t get up, but I was only eight, and I didn’t know what to do about that.\n\nOr, I remember that time when I was pedalling around on my first bike in our driveway. It was such a pretty shiny red colour, covered with Cinderella stickers- I loved it so much. It must have been very soon after I fell from the swing. I looked up from, and saw our car backing in on me.\n\nI realised I’m going to be squished, just like the roadkill we saw when driving out of the city, like a squashed bloody pancake with fur sticking out. I flung myself off my bike. The car ran over my pretty red bike with a horrible crunching sound of metal, I could feel the whoosh of the tires as I lay on the driveway, barely five inches away.\n\n\"Jennie! Jennie! Are you ok?\" My dad rushed out of the car towards me, and paused when he saw the mangled bike while I got up. I saw that same look as when I fell from the swing- those burning angry eyes and then, I felt fear flicker deep in the pit of my stomach. I remember first feeling sad about my bike, but then more afraid than sad.\n\nAfter he tried to drown me in a crowded city swimming pool, I knew I had to do something.\n\nI didn’t understand why – he was generally a nice normal daddy, and he had promised me he would get a new red bike, just like the one he had accidentally crushed with our car. But then the swimming pool happened.\n\nMe and my dad had this little game in the shallow end - he would stand with his legs far apart, I would swim under the water and swim through his legs, and come up on the other side. I loved doing that- I could swim back and forth through his legs a hundred times!\n\nAnyway, I swam through once, came up to the surface laughing with happiness at accomplishing this, dove back down, peered through the blue stingy chlorinated water at his legs standing wide apart, went through, and he brought his legs sharply together, gripping my sides tightly, squeezing and squeezing.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night, sweating, remembering the feel of his legs pinning my sides, holding me down in the water.\n\nI scrabbled and pushed at his legs with my hands trying to make him let go of me, but when he didn’t I opened my mouth and bit him in the calf, sinking my sharp new teeth into his hairy flesh as deep as I could. He twitched and loosened his grip, and in that same instant I slipped out and up, gasping and spluttering.\n\nWe looked at each other through the bright blue pool waves. We didn’t say anything. I looked down, and I could see the dark trickle of blood by his legs.\n\nWe left the pool.\n\nI knew he wasn't going to leave it chance and accidents anymore. And I knew he was running out of time.\n\nI never found out the exact nature of the business my dad was in- but I knew he had to kill me because of his business. He was talking a lot, loudly into his laptop, “the project has to start” “we need the money” “luck is on our side” and then promising he would \"get it done\", and I knew \"it\" meant killing me.\n\n“I understand” I heard him say. “I will. By the end of the week.” And I knew he meant I would be dead by the end of the week.\n\n“And you’ll hold up your end?” he asked into his laptop. “the investment…our project? Yes, yes, I know, I’m not doubting you.”\n\nYears later, I was studying Greek Myths at high school and learned about Agamemnon and what he did to his daughter and realised that was why my dad was trying to kill me. To win something. He had to kill me, to make his business succeed.\n\nAfter the swimming pool, I told my mom. She didn’t believe me at first. She looked at me with horrified eyes- “Jennie- what are you saying? About your own dad?”\n\n\\-“Go look at my bitemark on his calf” I replied. She fell silent.\n\nThat night, I heard her moving about in the landing outside our bedrooms, just at the top of the stairs. I opened my door a bit, and saw her carefully placing my Lego pieces in a row right on the top stair. Then she went back in their bedroom.\n\nI waited. Soon after, Daddy came out of their bedroom. He stepped on the lego, gave a small shriek and tumbled down the staircase.\n\nMom came out of the bedroom.\n\nShe was carrying the iron.\n\nShe went downstairs.\n\nI crept out and looked down through the banisters, and watched my mom give a short swift bash with iron to my Dad’s head, as he was lying on the floor trying to get up. Immediately he fell back and his legs were still. Mom bashed his head again. Then she began coming up the stairs.\n\nWe looked at each other. And then we went each to our own bedrooms.\n\nI honestly don’t remember much about what happened afterwards, just feeling good that no one was trying to kill me to make their business succeed.",

        "author": "DarkSire1",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10jj9tl/the_puppet_show/",
        "text": "I once lived in a quaint, quiet town in the rural U.S., up until the events I’m about to recount for you. Something you have to understand is that this town didn’t really have much public entertainment. So, whenever a circus or play came to town, we would all flood to it, glad just to have something to do.\n\nI lived with my son, Drew, who was just 7 years old at the time. His interests came mostly from what he saw on the old box television in our living room. For this reason, they changed almost every week. One day it was monster trucks, the next it was some cartoon. \n\nOne crisp fall evening, I was out at the market with Drew when a burst of color on a nearby wall caught my eye. I walked over and read the plastered piece of paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puppet Show!**\n\nAll are welcome!\n\nFree of charge!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was instantly interested. There had never been a puppet show here before. We had our fair share of circuses and traveling magic shows, but never a puppet show.\n\nDrew, who had just begun learning to read and write, sounded out the words on the poster. “Puh…pit?” he said slowly.\n\n“Yeah, Drew. Puppets!” I said. “Do you want to go see them?”\n\nThe little boy’s face lit up when I said it, and he nodded excitedly.\n\nThe show was scheduled for that evening, 7:00, at the long neglected outdoor community theater on the edge of town. \n\nLater that day, after I had put away the groceries, Drew begged me to take him early. I guess he thought that maybe he could go backstage or something and meet the puppet master, or masters. I finally broke, after much pleading from him.\n\nIt was around 6:00 when we arrived at the theater. It had gotten colder, and there was now a cold breeze. Luckily, we had brought our jackets.\n\nThe theater was small, maybe big enough for three or four actors on the stage at a time, with twenty or so chairs haphazardly arranged in front of it. Someone had spent quite a bit of time using sandbags to weigh everything down, which was good, as the wind had picked up significantly now.\n\nThe only thing different than normal when we got there was the small puppet theater which was set up on the stage. There didn’t look to be anybody around. Not even a puppet master.\n\nDrew and I took our seats, close to the stage so we could see. I felt him tug on my arm after a minute of sitting.\n\n“Daddy, can we go say hi to the puh-pits?” he asked eagerly.\n\nI looked up at the puppet theater on the stage. Still, it didn’t look like anyone was there yet.\n\n“Drew, I don’t think-”\n\nSuddenly, a strange, jaunty tune began to play from the stage. It was quiet, and it sounded faraway, but it immediately caught both of our attention.\n\nLights on the puppet theater began to turn on, one by one, some appearing to have difficulty doing so, turning on and off, and, finally, back on again.\n\nThe music stopped once all the lights were on. All was quiet, except for the whistling of the wind.\n\nSuddenly, a pink hand puppet rose up on the stage. It was a sock painted pink, with buttons glued on for eyes and… was that real blond hair?\n\n“Hiyah kids! I’m Mia! Who wants to see some puppets?” The voice that came from the puppet was squeaky and high pitched, and there was a strange undertone to it.\n\n“Me! Me!” cried Drew. I was too confused to say anything, but I couldn’t place my finger on it.\n\nThe puppets began acting out a play. Mia was joined by Jonah and Randy. The puppet master had to switch hands pretty often, but the switches were barely noticeable and almost seamless.\n\nJonah and Randy were both, as it seemed, fighting for Mia’s love. It was obviously superficial and made for children, but again, I felt like something was off. Maybe it was the cheerful way they all talked. Or the almost too realistic hair on all of them.\n\nDrew was loving the puppets. He was loudly laughing at the funny parts, and actually crying at the sad parts. I remained confused. Why was I so unsettled by these puppets?\n\nThen, things began to get strange. Some of the lights on the puppet theater began to flicker.\n\nMia had grown tired of Jonah and Randy. It might have been my imagination, but I think I remember her, in her same cheery voice, remarking about how ‘ending it all’ might be the easiest way out. Maybe she was talking about ending the relationships with the other puppets?\n\nThen, out of the blue, the play took a dark turn. All of the puppets were on a walk together, making their jokes in their happy voices, when Mia pulled out a knife.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a setup for another joke. But then, I leaned forward and got a look at the knife. It wasn’t a prop. It was a kitchen knife, glistening in the theater’s flickering light bulbs.\n\nDrew began laughing at this, like it was another one of their jokes. I remained frozen, paralyzed in confusion and fear.\n\nMia took the knife and plunged it into Jonah’s back. The puppet convulsed forward as Mia took it back out and stabbed it into Randy.\n\nThrough the torn sock fabric, I could see the skin of the hand within. Blood poured out of both of the stabbed puppets as they continued convulsing on the ground.\n\nAt this point, Drew was laughing so hard, I thought for sure that we weren’t seeing the same thing. The scene was covered in blood now. The hands or feet which were in the blood-soaked puppets had retreated downwards, leaving the puppets sitting in the pool of blood.\n\nMia was laughing, but something was wrong, so unnatural, that I wanted to rip my ears off. Drew just kept laughing. He seemed to be genuinely enjoying the show.\n\nSlowly, too slowly, both Mia and Drew stopped laughing. I was sitting there in complete silence, in shock at what I just saw.\n\n“Well, who wants to be my new friend?” Mia called out towards us.\n\nDrew clapped and yelled out, “Me! Me!” and began running towards the stage.\n\nI got over my horror, for only a second, as I grabbed him by the shoulder and yanked him back as I stood up. But, he did something that shocked me.\n\nHe made a face at me, then pushed my hand off and ran to the stage.\n\nI couldn't move as he climbed up onto the stage.\n\nI couldn’t move as he got into the puppet theater.\n\nI couldn’t move as Mia told him that he was going to wear a mask for his puppet.\n\nI couldn’t move as I watched my son, my own son, act out a puppet show perfectly.\n\nAnd I still couldn’t move as the show ended tragically, with Mia putting her knife into the mask which had my son inside of it.\n\nAnd I didn’t move as a man in a dark robe packed up the theater, with my son still in it, and walked down the path out of town.\n\nTo this day, I mourn my son. I wish I could have moved that day, but I was so frightened at everything I was seeing. \n\nBut the fear did not go away. I still fear that the puppet show will go to another town, or worse, visit me again. That man is still out there, running his twisted horror show for all to see...\n\nFree of charge.",

Something you would find at a abandoned house.\n\n\n  \"I'm with you man I don't think I've ever seen that door there before\". Jeff says. \n\n\n  I let out a deep breath trying to calm myself down as I unclench my fist. \"So I ain't crazy there is a litteral door right there on the stairway?\" I ask him again.\n\n\n  As if to proof my point he goes up to the door and taps on it. \n\n\n  \"You think I should call the contractors or the bank?\"\n\n\n  As Jeff was just staring and studying the door he looks again at me. \"Maybe the contractors\" \"I don't know man\". He says this generously. He knows how pissed I am amd is trying not to make me make a fool of myself.\n\n\n  \"Well I'll guess I will call the contractors tomorrow then. Thanks man sorry if i sounded angry on the phone\". I tell him as we head to the door. \n\n\n  \"It's cool man. I'd be angry too of I found another door in my house\". He then heads back to his house on the left. \n\n\n  I shut the door as I'm now feeling relaxed. I wonder how Sarah would react to this whenever she gets home? She would probably react the same as I did. Good thing she went out for groceries and i came back from the book sale at the Barnes and Noble. \n\n\n  Before I lock the door I write a note and put it on the front door for Sarah. \n\n\n  I then go up the stairway with a now existing door on it which I'm still confused about. As I get in the warm shower I start thinking of after dinner to see what was inside it. You hear alot of crazy stories of people finding another person living in their house.\n\n\n  When Sarah comes back from the store I show her the now there door. She says that she agree's with me and ask me the question i was hoping she'll ask. \n\n\n  \"You want to open it?\" She looks at me smiling with them daring eye's of hers. \n\n\n  I smile at her as if to say I accept her challenge and reached my hand towards the doorknob and open it. My heart beating with anticipation. As my hand turns the doorknob it stops halfway. \n\n\n  I frown as i realized it is locked.\n\n\n  I look at my wife and ask her if she has seen a key that we don't have kind of like the door. She shakes her head no. \n\n\n  Sarah then tells me that she is going to get ready for bed and kisses me on the chick playfully. As I watch her go upstairs I then turn my attention back to the door.\n\n\n  Why is it locked? Why did we just now notice it if it has been here before? \n\n\n  I then hear my wife holler at me from upstairs to go to bed. As i go up I take one last look at the door that seems out of place and then go upstairs. \n\n\n ***************************************\n\n\n  Knock, Knock, Knock.\n\n\n  I hear the knocking while I was sleeping and got up. \n\n\n  I look at my wife to see if she was also awake but she isn't. I then get up and go out into the dark hallway and look with my heart beating down the stairs.\n\n\n  Knock, Knock, Knock.\n\n\n  I hear the knocking but this time it sounds a bit louder. I then went down the stairs and look through the keyhole of my front door. I see no one there. \n\n\n  My heart suddenly starts beating. It's the feeling that you get when someone else is inside your home. \n\n\n  I grab a kitchen knife from the knife stand and search the house. I see nobody except me and my wife. I raise the knife down as I feel a bit relieved but the hairs on my body are still standing up. \n\n\n  KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!\n\n\n  I jump as I hear the knocking again except it's louder than the other ones. I then pay my attention towards the door that just appeared yesterday. My heart beating as I hear the new door shake as the knocking continues.\n\n\n  KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!\n\n\n  I drop the knife in my hand as I suddenly start shivering. My body moving uncontrollably as I walk towards the banging door. \n\n\n  Why isn't Sarah awake? I think in my head. \n\n\n  My hand moving with a force that isn't my own touches the doorknob and starts to turn. I smile remembering that the door was locked because there was no key to it. \n\n\n  With my heart beating like it was going to come out of my chest and my body feeling tense the door somehow opens up. \n\n\n  My heart drops as I see a endless plane of shadow in the room. It looks like it could go through miles. \n\n\n  With the door still creaking open one of my feet take a step foward. I realized that I'm being drawn into this infinite realm of darkness.\n\n\n  Sarah! Sarah! My mouth trys to move but it can't. \n\n\n  Why ain't she getting up? I say to myself inside my gead as I feel like I'm going to cry. My left foot then follows the right one and the cycle continues. \n\n\n  It feels like time is moving slowly as I am walking. Like I'm going towards the Green Mile. \n\n\n  My eye's are beginning to swell up. I take what I think is my final steps in and the door slams shut with a loud BANG! I then feel the force leave my body as I cry out in fear. \n\n\n  I then hear Sarah shouting my name as I look towards where the door had been. \n\n\n  \"Mike! Mike!\" She yell's worried about me. \n\n\n  I scramble towards the door and yell back at her. \"Sarah! Sarah honey can you here me!\" \n\n\n  \"Mike! Where are you?! Where is that door?!\" \n\n\n  I slump down on the floor of darkness as I realize that the door is no longer there. I continue to hear my wife yell for me as she is banging on the spot the door used to be. \n\nWith nothing else too do I cry myself to sleep. \n\n\n  If you are wondering how I'm typing this I found my phone in my pocket. I'm going to send this message to anyone I can in hopes of fimding me again. There should be more people here. Should be more doors. \n\n\n  Sarah my darling if you are one of the people reading this I love you and i will get back too you. \n\n\n  As to the people that are not Sarah, if you one day notice a door that isn't there before. Wait till nightfall. When you hear the banging coming from your new house addition please open it. ",

        "text": "I'm going to be honest with you, I'm pretty sure I'm going to die in a log cabin in the middle of Canny Valley, in a bed with a brown stain on the sheets, that is growing surprisingly fast as I look down at it. To be fair the stain was there before I got the large gashe in my stomach, with pieces of branches and dirt in my hair. And branches through my stomach..Hole? \n\nI'm going to say hole. Though my stomach is the worst injury I have, it's far from my only. I'm pretty sure my left leg is broken along with my right arm. There goes my night of fun for a few weeks. Well it might just be the rest of my life if things don't get any better. Liz is telling John to keep pressure on my stomach while Maddie tries to comfort Ken.. His freckled face is being covered by his hands while his brown hair comes down just adobe his ear… I don't like seeing his cry, somehow that makes me feel worse than the already life taking pain I'm in right now. \n\nJohn tried to take my phone out of my last good hand but I weakly moved it out of the way making the amazing sound of my best airplane noises. The wrinkles on his face from years of a life not lived so well. His nose moved as his green eyes rolled bad he shook his head. Then he gave me a look that could only be. \n\n\"Really kid?\" Or \"You're a dumbass\" knowing John. It was both. \n\nElizabeth reached over to grab a bottle of alcohol. Unfortunately it was the burning the shit out of your cut kind and not the \"I forgot what it's like to be human\" kind. You're probably wondering why the hell am I spending time making this when I'm basically bleeding to death and to be honest..\n\n I don't know.. \n\nThe urge Just kinda came over me as Ken placed me in the bed. I'm rambling, but in my defense the pain is.. How do I put this.. Fucking awful. Like the worst type of pain that a person can feel without passing out. And the only reason I'm not passing out is because if I do I just might not wake up..\n\n I should probably start from before I got this whole in my chest and before I woke up to the sound of my alarm going off in my ear over and over. I thought about tossing the damn thing across the room when I remembered that I actually wanted to get up this morning. Because I started my new job today. It was a rather new experience for me. \n\nI'm the newest member of the Canny Valley National Park, a place full of a bunch of weird and messed up stuff. Canny is a place both in the middle of nowhere and also full with more people then you would realize. Canny is named after the explorer and first manor of the town. Nathan J. Canny ``discovered\" this place nestled between a mountain range with two being on opposite sides of each other with the valley in the middle. Thick woods circle the town to the point where you can walk 10ft without running into a tree.  Hell, one day Mr.Willson had a redwood fall on his shed. The damn thing shocked the whole town when it fell. It took them a full week to move the thing, but at least now Mr.Willson is enjoying the new all wood Workshop in the back of his yard. The river Stic flows through part of the town until it all runs together in Lake Aster. \n\nI started working here after I graduated from highschool about 4 months ago. College was an opinion but I lost all motivation for anything that had to do with school after the pandemic made us all couch potatoes. Now I'm not from Canny myself. Originally I'm from the city but there's only so many buildings you can look at, draw and count before you go insane. Writing helped a lot for a bit, just random things that come to my mind and working on that great American novel every housewife swears she's on the verge of. \n\nThings didn't get much better until business started opening back up. On my way around applying to every job in a 5 mile radius via a mix of walking, biking and a very socially distancing bus ride, I stop for lunch at a coffee shop a few blocks down from my place. I walked inside passing a table with a man and a woman both giving the \"we're trying not to make a scene\" face. One obviously came here to break up with the other.\n\n I hated the tension that came in waves from them so I quickly made my way to the front counter. I was in line with a number of overly normal looking people. A couple of college students that looked like they were straight out of a night of red bull, over-thinking and a mess of late papers. There was a woman with a stare that gave out the, \"This line better move before I get the manager\" vibe. And I didn't want to be around that nightmare. \n\n\nWhen I got to the front of the line I just ordered a mocha and took a seat on the side of the restaurant near a window. I was enjoying my cup of coffee while I reflected on the shear about rejection letters I would get over the next few days, when I saw something that caught my eye.  It was a help wanted sign. I walked over to the bulletin board that had a number of different posters on it. A few lost dog posters, a flier for something that called The way of Tytis ,which was probably a clut; promotional advertisements for new drinks coming with the change of the season ,No doubt reeking of pumpkin, and one of those 1-800 numbers that is no doubt a scam. \n\n\nIt took me longer than I felt comfortable emitting to actually find the help wanted sign I saw but I finally did, with a little help from him..\n\nWhat was I talking about again? It is very hard to remember what I saw while Liz pulls a branch from my leg. Now that's I sight you never see every day, and the most fucked up part about it that I can't feel a fucking thing down there. So just image you're pulling out a little splinter only to pull out a fucking log. That's the face I imagine I'm making right now.  Hopefully I'm just too much in shock to feel it but the alternative is VERY VERY bad. Yeah I don't want to think about that. \n\nFuck, I got a little off track there. Anyway the sign was for a new ranger for Canny Valley National Park. Now I've been a city box for most of my life. Hell, I barely know how to make a smoker let alone pitch a tent, but I have always wanted to be out in the great outdoors. The feeling of being discontinued from what country is doing what, who's cheating on who and whatever the hell Twitter is. So I took the flier. \n\nAfter a couple of hours I made my way home passing a few street performers, and nearly got hit by a bus. In my defense I have a big problem with going in and out of autopilot. When I was younger I wasn't exactly the best kid but to be fair my classmates were little assholes. Yes I was bullied but I did fight back. I once saw a group of girls throw our class hamsters out of a window. \n\n\nI really liked that little guy.. \n\nAnyway when I got home I talked to my mom about it, and gotta tell ya. That was like fighting in a war with to broken legs going up hill, the sun burning in your while hot oil is being poured down on you. Oh and there's bees everywhere. I understand all of her concerns, I really do. Being one of the only children my mom had me and my little sister was all she had left in the world after my father passed a few years ago. And it was honestly one of my main reasons for wanting the job in the first place. I wanted to make a lot of money by just making sure a few campers don't get lost in the woods. It doesn't sound too bad. Of course I knew there was more to it than that, but I never expected this.. \n\nAnyway let's just skip the part where I had to explain everything to my mom and my little sister. Trust me we'll save a lot of time plus the meds are starting to kick in and I really want to at least get to my first day here. When I actually took the time to look up where it was, of course not telling my mom I didn't look into the place before, but I couldn't find a location.\n\n I scrolled through the website for over an hour but didn't see any.  All the regular information and requirements were there. Name, age, social security, background, and a section that said now pier experience is not needed but basic first aid and search &amp; recurve skills will give you a higher chance of being hired. Under this it was a number to call the Ranger station for more information. \n\nI called the number list on the website and after not even one ring someone picked up. \n\n\"This is Madison with Canny Valley National Park Services, how may I help you?\" A kind female voice came from the phone along the side of papers moving.\n\n\n\"HI, I'm calling about one of your fliers. I wanted to apply for a park ranger position. \" I said with a bit more nervousness than I wanted. \n\n\"That's wonderful to hear. We've had the position out for a while now. We'd love to have you a part of our team here. May I have your email so I can send you the paperwork?\"\n\n\"Oh sure it's.\" Not telling you my email. \n\nShe went silent for a moment then I heard a notification sound from my phone. \n\n\"I just sent the email to you all the paperwork you need to fill out along with our employment requirements. I hope to hear from you again if you have any questions. You have a good day Michael. \"\n\n\"I'll make sure to call if I have any. You had a good day- wait, how did you?\"\n\nIt kind of freaked me out that she knew my name without me saying it and honestly it freaked me out even more when I sent in my application and got hired immediately. It turns out that Canny was just a state over, plus the city I lived in was right on the board of the two so It was only a few hours of driving. I told them I could probably just take a bus or plane ticket there but they inserted one of their rangers to come get me. Madison told me that they'd send John (one of their senior Rangers) to get me and that he'd be here next week.  \n\nA week later I was sitting in my living room with my mom giving me my hundredth hug. When we heard a knock on the door. I walked over and opened to see a tall middle aged man with salt and pepper hair. Now to say he was in good shape for his age would be an understatement because he was in good shape for any age. He wore a button up shirt with two pockets on the chest area, a lot with dark green pants and some wore looking hiking boots. \n\n\"Excuse me, are you Michael Goddson?\" \n\n\"Yeah that's me. John, right?\"\n\nHe reached his hand out to shake. I reached out my hand to return the gesture and reserved a handshake that was more gentle than I thought it would be. I invited John inside to receive the same interrogation that I received from my mom for the past week. She walked over to him and reached out her hand to shake his hand and pulled him down on the couch to sit next to her. It was really funny to see the look on his face as my small and petite mother pulled him down with no effort. \n\n\"So, Mr?\"\n\n\"Baker, but you can just call me John.\"\n\n\"Well it's nice to meet you John. I'm Katharine but you can call me Kat. Now I just have a few questions for you.\"\n\nNow when I say that my mom got this Man life story, I mean I now know exactly where he used to sit in the fourth Grade and how he still to this day doesn't like the crust on his sandwiches, or pizza. Plus the names of his three daughters, Susan (who was the oldest), Jessica (who was a sheriff's Deputy in Canny) and Mary (was actually my age, but was in Virginia for school.)\n\nAfter another hour of hugs from my mom, John and I were finally in his red 2019 Ford F-150 on the road headed out to Canny. \n\nI watched as the city fading away into open fields, summer in the Midwest was always nice to see. Back when I was younger my dad would take us out here for picnics. It was one of the memories that I hold on to tightly when I think of him. \n\nWe passed the field after a few for about an hour when I finally pulled my consciousness from wherever it goes when I space out and I sat up my seat and yawned.\n\n\"You're finally awake? I thought you'd sleep the whole trip to be honest with you. Most new people stay up all night nervous and end up passing out in that very seat you're in right now.\" \n\nJohn looked. Over for a second then hand me an energy drink. \n\n\"Flavour Blash X? I have never seen this brand before. What flavor is X even supposed to be grape?\"\n\n\"It's Cherry actually.\" He said with a smile that reminded me of the one my dad would get when showing him the art I used to make in school. I pushed the thought away as I drank some of the drink and it wasn't bad actually. It was actually really good and I felt a lot less sleepy. \n\n\"Oh. It actually is cherry.\" \n\nAfter about five more minutes, passing fields and listening to country music (that I hated but didn’t say not to be rude)  I decided to strike up another conversation to avoid  the awkwardness of being in a car with someone you don't know. \n\n\"So, how long have you lived in Canny?\" \n\n\"I've lived in the Valley my whole life. My family's been there since the town was founded and I never found a reason to leave. Well, except for a vacation with my family. \"\n\n\"Have you ever been to any other countries? I bet the culture shock can be a bit much for someone who's only lived in one place their whole life.\"\n\n\"Just because I'm from The Valley doesn't mean I didn't travel when I was younger. I've been to a number of countries in Europe and Asia and a few in the Pacific.\"\n\n\"I am not asking you to be a couch potato or anything but I didn't take the travel type. \" I said with genuine surprise in my voice. This guy has been all over the world and probably knows a couple different languages and decided to be a boring old park ranger. And I was going to comment when he beat me to it. \n\nHe let out a long sigh, one that held the air of someone tired beyond belief. He turned to look at me and as he did it looked as if he aged 10 years in a matter of a few seconds. \n\n\"Look Michael, you are a good kid and usually newcomers get cold feet around this time. This is the part where I tell you that this job isn't going to be easy..You have to give a hundred percent, hundred percent of the time. You never know when you will get the call to help look for someone who's gone missing in the woods. Of course it's not a big deal at first. Probably just a camper who got a little turned around on their way back from making friends with a tree. \"\n\nThe sun hit the sides of my eye as the earlier morning faded to noon and I started to sweat from both the heat and the nervousness from the dramatic shift in the conversation. \n\n“You look around for them for a bit; an hour turns into two, then three, then four, when you look up it's been a day and now things need to get serious. The family gets more and more worried and now you have half of the sheriff's department and most of the town looking for them. Day after day, little by little people lose hope and so do you. At a certain point your mind switches from looking for a person, to a body. Even then there are times where you don’t find anything; no person, no body, no clothes, no shoes, just nothing..”\n\nThe weight of his words fill the car and my mind with equal quietness and value. \n\n\"Now I'm not trying to scare you off, well maybe some little part of me is subconsciously but those are just the facts of it. If that's too much for you and you want to head back now there is no shame in that.\"\n \nI stayed quiet for a moment honestly thinking how to respond. I knew the job won’t be easy and I planned to take it as seriously as a person could but even after hearing that, I did consider giving up. \n\nThe four-laned highway slowly turned into two as the sprinkle of passing trees started to pour over into a thick forest that surrounded the car on both sides of the road. The forest stretched as far as the horizon, as two mountains guarded opposite sides of the valley. The sun hung longer in the sky just above the trunk leaving no shadows in its wake. I looked out the window still pondering his words until an idea came to mind. \n\n“How about this? Give me one month to learn and get used to the swing of things and if both of us feel like I can't handle it then I'll be on the first bus back to the city. Deal?” \n\nJohn made a face that was a mix of contemplation and maybe constipation? Anyway he took a turn that seemed to come out of nowhere and we headed down making the whole trunk bounce, which made me jump a little in my seat. And i'm not afraid to admit i might have yelp a like a lost puppy but you did fell of fast he had that turn to you can respectfully fuck off. John laughed for a minute. Before wiping the tears from his eyes and focusing more on the road.\n\n“I’m glad you’re getting a kick out of my fear.” I said, pulling myself back into my seat in my more comfortable pistons.\n\n“It’s not that, I just forget how that turn can take out of towners by surprise. I swear I could have one hell of a photo album of all the different faces and positions people have learned in after that turn. Then that yelp was just downright adorable. ”  \n\n“That yelp was just downright adorable! Can you just focus on driving please??” \n\nJohn laughed again and continued down the road for another few minutes as the dirt slowly turned from back to pavement. We continued down the road to see a building coming to view along with a sign that read “Welcome To CannyValley, Population” . Now I might have been seeing things well, not really what I saw but more of what I didn’t rather could see. For some reason I couldn’t read the population number and the weirdest part about that is even though i couldn’t read it; I knew it went up.",

        "text": "I've recently come home from being in the navy, living with my mom and my step-dad until I can get off my feet properly.  When I first saw, whatever the fuck this thing is, it was late November.  Thanksgiving had come and passed and that night I was cleaning some of the dishes we had.  I heard a loud thud outside the house in our back yard (we had a ¼ of an acre, and on our street it was the biggest yard until our neighbor bought the house next to them and demolished it) I stopped what I was doing and glanced outside, it was only sunset so I could still see the yard clearly, but nothing was out there.  I turned back to my dishes and a few minutes later I heard my mom walk in, followed by her horrific screech.  When I turned my step-dad and a few other family members had seen what had happened.  I followed my step-dads' and uncles' gazes to the backyard, even now I don't really know how to describe it.  It had a deer skull as a head, Glowing red eyes, and the body all contorted.  My uncle ushered everyone back into the living room and he grabbed a 12 Guage from the gun cabinet in the living room, my step-dad got his barreta M9 from his bedside table, I grabbed the AR we had in the gun cabinet, and my other uncle and cousin grabbed hunting rifles (Murica) and we ran outside.  The thing still stood there, dragging something along with it.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it was one of the neighborhood kids from down the street, mangled and bloodied.  My uncle shot first, piercing the thing in the leg while the rest of us had started to fire at it. The thing ran, and a few minutes later the police, firetrucks, and an ambulance showed up (small town, when something happens here Emergency responders always show up quickly.  The police put the five of us in cuffs and we sat out front of my house.  Everyone on the block was outside wondering what was going on as the poor kid was put into the ambulance, declared dead on the scene.  We were taken in that night, and questioned on what happened.  We gave them our story, but they didn't believe us.  That was until one of our neighbors (God bless her soul) had barged in and showed them a video she had taken.  We were held for a little longer (just till daybreak) and we were let go.  The next day was somber and quiet.  The family of the kid weren't home, the whole street stopped by our house asking what had happened, my step-dad yelling at them to go away before we returned to our peace, as much as we could get.\n\nIt went quiet after two weeks, the cause of death was best attack.  Bullshit. We know what we was, and others.  The next time I saw this thing was when me and a buddy were traveling around town, looking for something to do.  We had sat at the local park where the woods bordered the edge and a few houses and buildings across the street.  We were joking around and coming up with ideas we could do, until we heard a low growl.  We turned to the forest and saw two red eyes, staring at us.  My buddy looked at me and I just stared at it.  I glanced at my friend and we were thing exactly the same thing.  We ran, the car only a few feet from us and we hurled ourselves in the car and got the fuck out of there.  We didn't speak until we pulled closer into town, where my buddy asked \"What the fuck was that?\" And I honestly couldn't give him an answer.\n\nOver the span of 3 weeks more people had dissappeared, pets dead and livestock slaughtered.  The town was in a fit, demanding to know what was happening.  I'll keep everyone updated on what else happens here, but as far as I'm aware: the mayor knows, the police know, and there are rumors of FBI getting involved (which I don't believe, cause it came from the town coot).  Whatever that thing was, it's still out there, and if multiple bullets don't do anything against it, I'm not sure what will.",

It was not.\nPhase 3 started with people smelling a putrid smell coming from their neighbor's house.\nAt first they were just smelling, then came the sounds, screams all day long, and then, we were seeing.\nIt was a fleshy mess, people's skin was melting, rotting away, and they were becoming estremely aggressive.\nThey were like zombies, but all they wanted was pain, they were addicted to pain.\nWe started running for whatever those things were, cursing out pain 2.0.\nHumanity was at a loss, no lockdown could change anything, they tried killing them, but all they got were satisfied screams and much stronger abominations.\nThe weakest were devoured, the strongest survived for a few days, the smartest were the ones to survive, creating a society in places in which the abominations were at bay or non existent.\nBut fleeing from a place to another every few weeks would not work, the losses were too much for a prize too low. People were killing themselves in the hopes of eternal peace. We, the only ones who were mentally strong enough to keep on going tried to find a cure, but there is no cure to an addiction. We tried reaching out to the company that started it all, but we found out that any trace of that company disappeared right after the outbreak, together with every single packet of Pain 2.0.\nNow nothing much changed, there are still many abominations wandering in the road.\nNobody tries to get the morale up, they know it's useless. Everyone kind of accepted their fate, in a way or the other, some tried killing themselves, but they knew we needed them and made the wise decision to stay till the end.\nWe are very few survivors, and the others aren't picking up on the radio, so I'm writing this in my last moments, the door won't hold them for much longer.\nGoodbye.",

        "author": "greg0525",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10jfi4f/i_found_my_twin_brothers_diary_and_it_was/",
        "text": "I had always been curious about my twin brother's life, especially since he had passed away so suddenly. We were close growing up, but as we got older, we grew apart and I never really knew what was going on in his life.\n\nThe tragedy of it all was that he ended his life in the bathtub by slashing his wrists. The event so disturbed my older brother Carl and me that we could no longer live in our family house. We then moved out and got a shared apartment together while searching for job opportunities. This was only a short-term solution until one of us found a more permanent living situation.\n\nSo, when I found his diary hidden away in his room while visiting my parents, I couldn't resist the urge to read it.\n\nThe first few entries were mundane, detailing his daily routines and his struggles at work. But as I kept reading, the entries became increasingly disturbing. He wrote about strange dreams that he had been having, about seeing shadows moving in the corner of his eye, and about feeling like he was being watched.\n\nI found myself becoming more and more intrigued by this secret side of my brother. I was convinced that he had been experiencing something supernatural; a disruption in the fabric of reality. So I decided to go to my older brother Carl and try to get his help in unravelling the mysteries hidden in Tom's diary, but when I showed him the diary, Carl dismissed it.\n\nHe said that there was no point in delving any further into what our brother had written — that trying to understand it would only be tormenting ourselves with unfair expectations. He said we should just remember that our brother’s memory will live on in us and leave it at peace.\n\nTo tell the truth, he and Tom were never close to each other, they were like strangers. Tom barely spoke to him, and when he did, it was a stilted, uncomfortable exchange. His words were clipped and void of emotion. My twin and I shared a bond that Tom could never comprehend; it made him envious. I could see the resentment in his eyes every time we exchanged glances. I was not surprised that he was so judgemental.\n\nSomehow he convinced me and I also dismissed it as just the ramblings of a troubled mind. But as I kept reading, the entries became even more disturbing. He wrote about hearing voices whispering his name in the middle of the night, about feeling a presence in his room, and about waking up to find scratches on his body.\n\nI was starting to get worried about my brother's mental state, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to these entries than just the ravings of a madman. I had to know more, so I kept reading.\n\nThe final entry was the most chilling of all. My brother wrote about a dream he had, in which he was standing in a dark, foggy forest. He could see a figure standing in the distance, and as he got closer, he realized that it was his own reflection. But when he looked closer, he saw that the reflection had eyes that were black as coal and a mouth twisted into a sinister grin.\n\nThen I woke up in a cold sweat, with the feeling that someone, or something, was still watching me. Whoever had been tormenting Tom, now, it seemed, was after me as well. I was dreading the possibility of discovering what I was sure was lurking in my own bedroom.\n\nI lay in bed that night, feeling utterly terrified. I could feel a presence in the room with me, and it seemed to be growing stronger with every passing moment. I was sure that it was the same entity that had been tormenting my brother and I was sure, too, that it was coming for me. I wanted to turn on a light and run out of the room, but I was too afraid to move. I was afraid that if I did, this invisible force would attack me. So instead, I just lay there, paralyzed with fear, waiting for whatever was coming. Eventually, I mustered up enough courage to turn on the lights, but to my horror, nothing was there. \n\nI raced down the hallway and burst into Carl's bedroom. He was nestled in the sheets of his unmade bed, snoring softly. I shook him until his eyes flickered open.\n\n\"Tom, wake up! There was a figure in my room! I'm certain it was watching me and I was so scared!\"\n\nHe grumbled and groaned, not wanting to face reality.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" He asked in a daze.\n\n\"The figure and voices I heard in Tom's diary! They're after me!\" My voice trembled as I spoke.\n\n\"I don't believe this nonsense! Get a grip, there's no such thing as ghosts or demons!\" He rolled back over and closed his eyes, trying to go back to sleep.\n\nAt that moment I knew I could not count on Carl.\n\nI had to find out the truth by myself. I decided that if I wanted to understand what was happening, I needed answers and the only way to get them was to do some research. So, I started looking into paranormal activity and soon came across a number of stories about ghosts, spirits, and other mysterious entities. I started by reading books on the supernatural and soon became engrossed in stories of hauntings, poltergeists, and other strange phenomena. I learned about the ancient belief systems of different cultures around the world and their beliefs about spirits, ghosts, and demons. These accounts were both fascinating and terrifying at the same time.\n\nAmidst the mound of new facts, the evidence seemed overwhelming yet directionless. I needed to delve into Tom's past, something my parents might have kept from me. As I was mustering the courage the next morning to approach them, I felt a foreboding energy permeating my room again. \n\nMy hands trembled as I dialed my boss and spoke quickly, my voice rife with fear. After hanging up the phone, I grabbed my coat and rushed out of the house. My body shook as I rushed down the street, convinced the presence was following me. People stared with wide eyes at my frantic movements, heads turning to watch me as I darted around corners. I could almost feel its cold gaze on my back, urging me to go faster. Eventually, I reached my parents’ house, and slammed the door shut behind me.\n\nMy mum sighed and looked away as she spoke.\n\n'Tom was such a great kid, always friendly and outgoing just like you and Carl.' My mom said, sipping her coffee on the couch.\n\n'You can't just believe that cheerful and happy people randomly kill themselves without any motive!' I protested, demanding an explanation.\n\nMy mother exhaled sadly. She absently stirred her coffee as she continued.\n\n'Something did happen. In the weeks leading up to it, his behaviour was changing. He looked a bit more distressed.'\n\nI gasped in horror as she finished her sentence, unable to comprehend what she was saying. I thought about all of the strange occurrences that had been happening around my environment—the voices in Tom's diary, the figure in my room—and now it all made sense.\n\n'Tom had become obsessed with the supernatural prior to his death and even though he never told anyone about it, his behavior had changed drastically after researching these matters online and learning about different cultures' beliefs about spirits and demons.' my mom said.\n\nJust like me, I realized.\n\nAt that moment I also realized that Tom's curiosity had made him vulnerable to whatever entity had been lurking in our home—the same one I believed was still there waiting for me now.\n\n'Do you still have his research material?' I asked.\n\n'To be honest, it gave me the creeps, so we burnt them all with your dad.'\n\nExcept for his diary that you missed, I told myself.\n\nI thanked my mother for finally giving me some clarity and rushed out of their home with a newfound determination to uncover the truth behind these mysterious events before they could harm me more. \n\nThe night seemed to descend slowly, the darkness consuming everything. I was exhausted from the day's events, and eventually drifted off to sleep. Suddenly I awoke in a cold sweat, my heart pounding in my chest as I felt a strange presence in the room. I heard voices whispering in sinister tones, and a chill ran down my spine. I was alone in the house; Carl had gone to a party and I was truly terrified. I was sure something evil was lurking in the shadows, determined to take my life.  I could hear faint whispers, like muffled conversation, echoing off the walls. There was an undeniable sense of hostility, an aura of malice that hung in the air like a physical thing. \n\nI flicked on every light switch in the flat, my heart pounding in my chest. I heard the clatter of keys and Carl stumbled through the door, his breath reeking of alcohol. He made his way across the room, barely able to stand upright, and I rushed to support him.\n\n'Carl, I have something really important to tell you!' I said excitedly.\n\n'Did you see another ghost?' he slurred sarcastically.\n\n'No, it's worse! It's something in our house - it's hunting me! Just like it was hunting for Tom!' I said nervously as we reached his bedroom. He collapsed on his bed with a groan.\n\n'You're still hung up on Tom's death,\n\naren't you?' he said, his voice empty of emotion.\n\n'Why? You are not?'\n\n'Yeah, you both were connected while I was the outsider. I am not surprised you are still so devastated!' his voice was flat.\n\n'What? What do you mean by that?' I asked but he became quiet and fall back asleep.\n\nMy heart raced as I spun around to see the looming figure in the hallway. Its dark, gnarled silhouette glided towards me, and I stumbled back against the doorway. In a panic, I grabbed for the key on the wall, hands shaking as I tried to unlock the door but my sweaty fingers kept slipping off. I could hear the figure's heavy footsteps getting closer and I could feel its icy breath on my neck and all I could think about was getting out of there.\n\nThere was another door near the entrance, which led to the garage. When I looked at it, relief flooded through me when I saw it ajar. I darted through the opening, slamming the door shut behind me. \n\nIt was totally dark inside, but my breathing started to slow, and my heart rate decreased with each exhale. I closed my eyes in an effort to shut out the chaos and for a few fleeting moments, I let myself believe that I might actually be safe.\n\nThen it started again. I could hear a series of whispers coming from all sides. I felt a chill run down my spine.\n\nI nervously flicked the switch, and a single bare bulb flickered hesitantly to life. I scanned my surroundings, a wave of terror washing over me. Looking around desperately, I yanked open the cupboards, hoping to find some kind of weapon or tool to protect myself. All I found were a few rusted screwdrivers and a hammer, which belonged to our father. I never understood why he wanted us to keep those old tools but now I was very grateful to him.\n\nAs I rummaged through the toolbox, something unusual caught my eye. I scooped up a small orange bottle and brought it closer to the light. Tiny white beads sparkled through the thin, semi-transparent plastic and I knew right away what it was.\n\nIt wasn't an evil force that was chasing me. Nor a ghost. Nor a malicious phantom.\n\nIt was all in my head.\n\nThen I realized what was happening. My brother.\n\nFinally, I realized why he had acted so strangely towards my twin brother and me. His jealousy and hatred had evolved into a sick sentiment.\n\nHe had driven Tom to take his own life, and he seemed intent on doing the same to me.\n\nI crept past my brother's bedroom door, every nerve in my body on edge. I held my breath, not wanting to wake him up and face his wrath. I peered in and saw his small frame tucked in the blankets, unmoving, with a peaceful smile on his lips. I exhaled a sigh of relief, grateful he was still sound asleep. I hastily grabbed my things, not wanting to risk him waking up and finding me gone. I knew this could be the last time I ever saw my brother, and even though I knew he was a psychopath, I felt a twinge of sadness as I closed the door behind me.\n\nMy heart raced as I quietly made my way into the night and out of his life. Even though Carl hasn't seemed to notice me missing yet, I know one day I'll have to tell my parents what happened.",

        "text": " Fifteen years ago, my friends and I visited a winter carnival. It was bright and noisy and packed. It was wonderful and it was huge. There were rides, blinking and tooting as people went round and round or up and down, screaming and laughing. There were food stalls which smelled of salt and oil and sugar. There were heavily tattooed folks lifting things and moving them around or gathered in small groups smoking and chatting. There were families and young lovers and teens running amok.    My friends and I spent hours there: four twenty-somethings looking at the kischy things the carnies were hawking, eating until we were almost sick, and riding rides until we actually got sick. It was Heaven.     \n\n\n  Late in the evening, as we wandered the grounds, Susan stopped suddenly and held her arms out to the sides, stopping us as well. “Look,” she exclaimed as she pointed between a tent and a dart game, “there's an arrow in the path leading down there!” She turned to look at the other three of us, her black hair fanning out from the speed with which she turned. “Let's follow it! I bet there's something amazing down there!”      \n\n\n  “Naw,” said her boyfriend, Dave, reaching out to take her hand in an attempt to pull her away from the alley, “It's probably a staff marking. I doubt it's for the customers. Let's go over to the darts, I'll win you a stuffed animal!”   \n\n\n  Susan wasn't having it, though, and she insisted that we follow the arrow. She was one of those people who is a force of nature so it only took a minute for her to convince us that we should check it out. “I mean, maybe it will be nothing. Maybe Dave's right and we just find crew stuff but maaaaaybee,” she leaned forward as her eyes grew wide, “maybe it's something amazing.”   \n\n\n  Susan and Dave led us down the close alley between attractions. After only a few steps, the sounds and smells of the carnival dimmed until they were completely gone. Then we heard a soft violin and smelled incense. A few steps later, I looked between Susan and Dave to see a softly lit purple and blue stripped tent with a black awning under which glowed the yellow light of the candle illuminating the door. Susan turned to us and whispered, “See? Something amazing!” She was giddy and, before anyone could respond, Susan was through the door and there was nothing else to do but follow her.   \n\n\n  Inside the tent, it was warm and warmly lit by several candles. In the center of the tent was a low table covered in a cloth which matched the tent.  Sitting at the table was a gray haired woman with a long braid and a face full of wrinkles. We saw her look up an smile, showing off pearly white teeth and a dimple in her cheek. It was everything you imagine when you think of fortune tellers.  \n\n\n“Good evening, children!” The woman stood when my best friend, Leah, walked into the tent, “I'm glad you chose to follow my sign. I was hoping you would visit me tonight. Now, sit. Sit. I will read your futures. I will tell you three things which will happen before you die and, since you're a young bunch, I will tell you when that will be.”   \n\n\n  There were three chairs positioned near the walls of the tent and one across from hers at the table. I'm not a believer in fortune telling or those kinds of supernatural things, but the fact that there were exactly the right amount of chairs for us was a little unsettling.     \n\n\n  Dave, Leah, and I sat in the chairs on the perimeter and Susan sat in the one at the table. Of course she would go first; this was all her doing anyway. We watched intently as the fortune teller pulled out a thick deck of cards and asked Susan to cut the deck and then choose a card.     \n\n\n  “Oh! You picked the Princess. A very good avatar. I think your future will be bright.” As she read the cards, the fortune teller spoke of a broken heart, a beloved child, and a  large sum of money. I listened with a small smirk because the predictions were so generic and positive. This woman put on a good show, but no one knows the future. Then, she told Susan the date of her death: July 19, 2019. Susan nodded and thanked the woman, commenting that she hoped the money came before the baby as she took Dave's seat and he walked to the table to hear his fortune.   \n\n\n  The fortune teller looked him over and then held out her bony hand, inviting him to place his hand in hers. She lifted the glasses which had been hanging around her neck and slid them onto her ears as she leaned over his hand and nodded. She told him that his life line was strong but his love line was short. She looked up into his eyes with sympathy as she told him that he would find a fulfilling job working with his hands, would escape death once, and would die with a broken heart. His expiration date was November 03, 2020.   \n\n\n  I saw pull a piece of paper out of her purse and write something down as Dave walked back to Leah, switching places with her. She whispered “I wonder what generic thing she'll tell me” and then swaggered to the table where she sat as the fortune teller sat stirring whatever was in the mug beside her. The fortune teller asked Leah to hold the mug between her hands in the center of the table as she looked into it. I assumed, and Leah later confirmed, that it was tea and the fortune teller was reading leaves in the beverage.     \n\n\n  “Oh!” A smile slid up the fortune teller's face as she starred into the mug, “No babies for you, which is what you want, eh? You will travel all over the country and you will be happy,” She looked up into Leah's eyes, “I know you won't believe me, but you will be very happy until March 12, 2022.”  Leah sucked in a breath and then stood to trade places with me.     \n\n\n  I remember thinking that all of this was very well done but that it couldn't be real as I walked to take my seat across from the woman who asked my to put my head down on my arms on the table so that she could touch my head. I complied, thinking this was odd, and then a shiver ran down my spine as I felt  her fingers slide into my hair and trace slowly over my scalp.     \n\n\n  I heard my friends as they changed position, probably leaning forward to hear what my fortune would be as she began to speak softly.   \n \n\n “You will achieve your dreams. Three babies,” she paused as he fingers continued to move, “a loving husband, and you will be a teacher until,” I held my breath as she concentrated, “until February 01, 2023.” I let out my breath in a gasp because I realized how specific Leah and my fortunes had been. How could this woman have known? Maybe this really was real.   \n\n\n I think she heard that gasp and realized what I had concluded because she leaned close and whispered, “Don't worry too much, dear. He will take good care of those babies.” With that, she patted my hand, bid us good evening, and ushered us back into the night.     \n\n\n  When we got back to the carnival proper, Susan was stoked. She was bouncing on the balls of her feet, barely containing her excitement. “I know what we have to do, y'all! We should get tattoos of our expiration dates!” I was a little shaken up, but Susan's exuberance was contagious, and we headed to the closest tattoo place to get our tatts.     \n\n\n  We should have taken it more seriously.  \n\n  \n  Since then, I have stayed in my home town, living the beautiful life of my dreams as I watched my friends live the lives the fortune teller predicted: Susan had a man leave her at the alter, another join her there before giving her a beautiful girl whom she named after me, and then she won the lottery. She used some of the lottery money to buy a trip to Hungary to see where her ancestors came from. While there, her taxi was in an accident and she died on July 19, 2019.   \n\n\n  Dave became a carpenter. He loved every minute of his work and then went home to his beautiful wife and spunky son each night. In 2020, he died with a broken heart having lived just long enough to watch his family succumb to the pandemic which passed him over before he took his life on November 03, 2020.   \n\n\n  Leah and I stayed together the weekend of that funeral. We were scared because we had also been living the lives the fortune teller had predicted. She was single, free, and traveled often for work. She had seen every wonder of the continental US, been to countless zoos and museums, and was living her best life... and she might only be able to live it for another two years.     \n\n\n  It was the same for me. I had two children and another on the way, a husband who loved me passionately, and a classroom which brought me joy every day. We wracked our brains to try to remember the name of the carnival or the name of the fortune teller, thinking we would go back to her and see if she could help us somehow. We made all kinds of plans for our expiration dates, finally agreeing to making sure we were together on March 12 and February 01.     \n\n\n  I watched my best friend die on March 12, 2022. We were sitting at a coffee shop in a big city talking about how Leah's tattoo had been itching lately and wondering if it was psychosomatic as her date approached when a car drove by and opened fire. The shooter sprayed the front of the shop with bullets and one of them hit Leah in the head and killed her almost instantly. I watched her grimace and then I watched the light fade from her eyes as she passed.     \n\n\n  Well, it's almost my expiration date. I am a believer. I have a few days left and I am still frantically searching for the woman, or the carnival, or anyone who can help me. I've taken the rest of the month off so I can spend the days looking for a way out and the evenings enjoying my family and trying not to cry. I have written letters to each of them and post dated them to be delivered on February 02.     \n\n\n  I'm writing this last bit on my phone as I walk. It's fifteen years to the day since we had our fortunes told and the carnival is back in town. I didn't spend as much time here as I did when my friends were with me. I didn't eat myself sick or ride any rides. I wandered around looking for the dart game and the arrow on the ground until I found it. I'm standing at the top of the alley, my stomach churning at the thought of walking down and finding the tent.     \n\n\n  I don't have much hope, but my tattoo itches and I think I smell incense.",

        "text": "  \n\nFrank had gotten the news by mail. He remembered all too well how it happened. He was sent a small VHS tape through the mail from the MPD. They didn’t knock, they didn’t ring the doorbell, they just left the package on the doorstep. He didn’t know how long it had been there, but it couldn’t have been too long. When he loaded the cassette into the VHS player, it immediately started playing. The screen read in big bold letters *United States Department of Temporal Phenomena* with the phrase “time flies” in latin above it. To Frank this made no sense. The MPD had made emergency televised broadcasts before, both test and real. He didn’t know why they didn’t do it this time. But as he watched the video it became increasingly clear. Something unnatural was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The video described creatures capable of taking on human form. Capable of taking on his own form. Capable of using his own fears against him. Since then, it’s been almost 3 months. Frank almost never leaves the house. He only ever leaves to get food, and he gets enough to last him another month. Frank kept himself occupied throughout the months. There was almost always knocking at his door. In fact, when the knocking finally stopped, that’s when he would know it was safe to leave. That’s how he would know they had grown bored of him. While walking throughout the house, he kept his eyes down, never looking out the windows. There was almost always *something* staring back. He never turned on the tv, unless it was to watch one of his own VHS movies. He had a couple of old Disney movies that went to VHS, plus a couple of horror movies. Of course he could never watch the horror movies. Too risky, of course. He kept them around for old times sake, for the distant hope that things would go back to normal.

        "text": "  \n\nFrank had gotten the news by mail. He remembered all too well how it happened. He was sent a small VHS tape through the mail from the MPD. They didn’t knock, they didn’t ring the doorbell, they just left the package on the doorstep. He didn’t know how long it had been there, but it couldn’t have been too long. When he loaded the cassette into the VHS player, it immediately started playing. The screen read in big bold letters *United States Department of Temporal Phenomena* with the phrase “time flies” in latin above it. To Frank this made no sense. The MPD had made emergency televised broadcasts before, both test and real. He didn’t know why they didn’t do it this time. But as he watched the video it became increasingly clear. Something unnatural was happening. The video described creatures capable of taking on human form. Capable of taking on his own form. Capable of using his own fears against him. Since then, it’s been almost 3 months. Frank almost never leaves the house. He only ever leaves to get food, and he gets enough to last him another month. Frank kept himself occupied throughout the months. There was almost always knocking at his door. In fact, when the knocking finally stopped, that’s when he would know it was safe to leave. That’s how he would know they had grown bored of him. While walking throughout the house, he kept his eyes down, never looking out the windows. There was almost always *something* staring back. He never turned on the tv, unless it was to watch one of his own VHS movies. He had a couple of old Disney movies that went to VHS, plus a couple of horror movies. Of course he could never watch the horror movies. Too risky, of course. He kept them around for old times sake, for the distant hope that things would go back to normal. Of course, he knew this wasn’t going to happen, but he could always dream. He would normally put on a Disney movie whenever the voices started beckoning. Something to drown them out. Anything to drown them out. He carried his pump shotgun with him at all times in the house. *For protection* he told himself.

        "text": "I feel everything.\n\nThat's not only how it is right now, but also how I answered Nick's question. I'm obviously writing this from home; I just figured I should mention that this time. So, some time has passed since this happened. I'm kind of beaten right now, but I'm enjoying the luxury of taking a breather. Casimir is currently acting as a sort of pillow for me. I'm not usually this clingy but I need the support right now. That out of the way, let me try and tell you what happened down in hell. I hope I can make this at least somewhat comprehensible, because to be honest, I'm all over the place. \n\nNick took it upon himself to accompany me to the prisons. Walking beside him made me feel sick. Actually, just looking at him made me feel sick. I knew arguing with him wouldn't help the matter, so I kept my mouth shut, really boiling the blood beneath my skin.\n\n\"Aw, don't scrunch up that pretty little face,\" the Beast commented snidely. \"You'll have your miller back in a few days. Just be a good girl and do my bidding.\"\n\n\"You're not even gonna tell me where he is? Or what you want from me?\" \n\n\"That's a no to both those questions,\" he replied. \"But don't worry about Hettmann. Do you really think I'd dispose of my favorite servant because of a small spat? And you'll find out what I need you to do soon enough.\"\n\n\"If you're going to forgive him anyways, why the fuck would you hurt him?\" I hissed.\n\nThe Devil smiled thinly. \"My wrath is as fleeting as all my emotions. The trick is to really lean into them. I do so without reservation, just as everyone should. Jacek knows this. All my acolytes do. They're used to it, and they accept it willingly.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but it was futile. My mind was racing. I hadn't felt this confused and shaken in ages. Getting my soul back was what I'd always wanted, but I hadn't thought it would be so painful. Jacek having been torn from my arms had left me in utter turmoil, more so than I could have ever imagined. I tried to block everything out, tried to shut the sense of loss off behind that same milky pane of glass I had gotten used to ever since the rabbit had run off on me, but it was like the partition was unreachable. I was whole again, for better or for worse.\n\n\"Where are we going? Doesn't every hellsphere have a prison?\"\n\n\"Sure. But I don't want to give you just *any* prisoner.\"\n\nThe meaning behind those words instantly began to dawn on me. My heart, still pounding like a sledgehammer, dropped into my stomach. \"No,\" I said softly. \"Please, you're not seriously thinking of…\"\n\n\"Let an old man have his fun, Fiona. No backtalk.\"\n\nAll I could do was follow at his heel, feeling rather like a small dog. Out on the street, we didn't have to push and shove—everyone we came across instantly jumped aside, making way for Nick to stride through. I stumbled after him in the wake, struggling to keep up. We changed spheres via the elevator. This time, the security spider scuttled all the way into the corner, not saying a word the whole ride. When the *ding* announced our arrival, we stepped out into faintly familiar, green-tinged surroundings. \n\n\"Welcome to Envy,\" Nick proclaimed dryly, spreading his arms in a mock gesture of hospitality. \"Home to… well, just another kind of scum.\" \n\n\"My brother's an inmate *here*? Why?\"\n\n\"He'd be better fitted to answer that,\" the Devil replied, taking up his powerwalk once again. He led me all the way into the center of the sphere, where an absolutely enormous building loomed overhead. A giant slab of concrete, bigger than anything I'd ever seen before, frightening in its sheer size alone. Here, the crowds seemed to grow especially thick. I noticed a bunch of people standing at the sides of the entrance. The prison was heavily guarded, from the looks of it. Of course, none of them did anything to stop us. \n\nThe inside of the prison was much like what I'd expected. I've never been to a human prison, but you know what they show you on tv and in the movies. This one looked rather similar to that kind of thing, at least on first glance, except that it was obvious that nobody ever cleaned. The smell of vomit, blood and feces hung thickly in the air, and it took a lot of willpower not to gag. The corridor I soon found myself standing in was incredibly long, thousands of tiny barred cells lined up on either side, the inmates within them all in a row as if on display. Some cells were slightly bigger than others, but quite a few offered barely enough room for a person to stand in. I tried not to meet the eyes of any of the people we passed by, not the prisoners' and not the wardens', either. The one thing I couldn't ignore was the noise, though. \n\nScreams and wails filled the hallway, some loud and furious, the sounds of raving lunacy; others low, cracked and broken. Moans of pain, sobs and weeping. Pointless cries for help praying for mercy. I didn't want to imagine what the wardens spent their time doing in this hole. I was certain that a normal prison on the surface was probably like a daycare center compared to this. The Devil stopped one of the passing wardens—a curvy lady with green skin and a resting bitch face, dressed in red latex like a nightmare dominatrix—and demanded to be taken to inmate 10789, or some other such large number. She agreed demurely, taking us up several floors before stopping by a cell that looked vaguely familiar from the video I'd seen. I took a deep, steadying breath, trying to assume some semblance of composure. Nothing could have prepared me for the encounter that was about to happen, though. \n\nJeremy Novak was lying butt-naked asleep on the hard floor of his dirty, reeking chamber. His hair was matted and greasy, like he hadn't washed it in a year, and stubble lined his jaw. That was really saying something, considering neither of my brothers ever managed to grow anything more than peachfuzz in terms of facial hair. He stank of sweat, urine and pus; he looked severely malnourished and just overall three minutes away from death. I couldn't imagine how long he'd spent in this state. He was covered in blood, wounds in various states of healing littered his body. The streaks on his back made it seem like he'd been whipped while the marks on his thighs and arms spoke of burnings and electric shocks. The sight was very nearly too much to handle. \n\nNick entered the cell without hesitation. When I didn't follow right away, he grabbed me by the arm and flung me inside with such force that a sharp yell escaped my throat. This caused my brother to stir. He kicked his legs a little, groaning and letting out a whine that nearly broke my heart. Nick growled. \"Get up, you piece of shit!\" he barked, lifting his foot and stomping down on Jeremy's unmoving wrist. I gasped and Jem shot up, his eyes flying open.\n\n\"This is your big day, Novak,\" the Devil hissed, delight lacing his voice like poison. \"Today's the day you're getting out of here.\"\n\n\"What are you on about?\" Jem asked in a gravelly, broken voice. \n\n\"You've got a visitor.\"\n\nJeremy lifted his head, milky, dull eyes fixing me in silence. I couldn't speak, feeling a pang of empathy that nearly caused my stomach to turn. Somehow, I couldn't reconcile the idea of this man being a cold-blooded killer and the sight of my little brother in my head. I held his gaze, trying to fight the cold rigidity that had taken a hold of me. Then, to my utter horror, a grin unfurled on his lips. \"Look at that. The prom queen,\" he spat, upper lip lifted in a sneer. \"What the fuck are you doing in here?\"\n\nI swallowed thickly. \"I'm going to take you with me. I'll take you home, where I'll perform a dangerous ritual with you as a conduit, which you will not survive.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nNick sighed. \"Miss Fiona needs a casket for a spirit she's trying to get rid of. For the time you're up top, I will supply you with a corporeal form like you have it down here. You'll be able to move, feel, eat and drink. Think of how nice a break that'll be for you. Now, after she's killed you, your soul is gonna be taken back to me, and we'll stick you back in here where you belong. Sound good? Good.\"\n\n\"The fuck?\"\n\n\"Hey, bastard, nobody asked for your opinion. Follow your sister's orders and don't even think about running off, because I swear to you, I'll send Hettmann after you again,\" Nick hissed.\n\nI flinched at the mention of Jacek's name, and to my surprise, so did Jem.\n\n\"Alright! Christ!\" my brother cried out, pushing himself off the ground with a pained moan. His bones cracked and he winced as he shifted his weight onto his feet. He squinted at me with hateful eyes. \"Remember your little fuckboy, sis? You know, short goth guy, mean eyes, really deep, creepy voice? Imagine my surprise when he came to collect me. Damn small world, isn't it?\" \n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Well.\" Jem shuddered, giving a nervous grin. \"I'm not keen on seeing that shitstain again, let me tell you. Brutal little motherfucker; dunno what he’s compensating for.”\n\n“Will you shut up?” Nick groaned. “You’re giving me a headache. You only have one job, do it, come back, and do *not* get up to anything stupid.”\n\n“Copy that,” Jem muttered. \n\nNick grabbed both of us by the wrist, and before I could even process what was happening, we weren’t in the prison anymore. In fact, we had left hell altogether and were now standing in the middle of my living room, right in front of Casimir, who was typing away on his laptop. Our sudden appearance caused him to scream, scrambling out of his seat and ripping off his headset. “What the fuck?” he cried out, wild eyes darting between myself, our brother and the Devil. \n\nIt was weird seeing Cas again. I suddenly felt extremely warm and fuzzy inside, despite the obvious horror in his stare. I threw my arms around his neck almost as if on instinct, and he immediately reciprocated. It felt like a blanket being pulled around me. *Little brother.* I had held him before, but it had never made me feel *this* safe and comforted. This was pretty great. \n\n“Whoa,” he mumbled, pulling me closer. “Fi, what–what am I looking at, help me out here. Is that…?”\n\n“Hey, Cas,” Jem drawled, dropping down on the sofa.\n\nCasimir reluctantly let go of me, throwing our sibling a brief glance before going back to gawking at the Devil. Nick smirked back shamelessly. “You, Casimir Novak, are even more attractive in person,” he said, voice husky and vaguely threatening. \n\nCas’ brows furrowed. “Do we know each other?”\n\n“I know you. But don’t worry about that now. Keep enjoying life, Casimir. I’ll see you.”\n\nAnd in the blink of an eye, Nick had disappeared into thin air. \n\n“Was that the Devil?” my little brother inquired.\n\n“Yeah,” I replied breathlessly.\n\n“Jesus, what a creep.”\n\n“Look, I’ll tell you what happened later. Jeremy… The Devil had me take him for our ritual. We should get that over with.”\n\nI heard Jem snort from behind me. Cas merely stared at me blankly. “You’re saying we’re gonna kill Jem?”\n\n\n“I’m already dead, Cas,” Jeremy answered in my stead. “Don’t mean a thing at this point.”\n\nThere was it again, that powerful wave of sadness. I still couldn't believe this. This was Jeremy. My baby brother Jeremy, the same Jeremy I'd grown up with, the same Jeremy I'd played hide-and-seek in the barn with, the same Jeremy who I'd always done my homework with after school. Casimir appeared to be similarly affected. He looked on in confusion, his eyes wide and glossy.\n\n“I can’t–Fiona, we…” he stammered, his gaze helplessly flitting between us. \n\nI sighed deeply. This was exactly what I’d been dreading. I didn’t want to have to go into this, I didn’t want to think about what we were about to do. I couldn’t leave Casimir hanging like that either, though. I ended up sitting down with him and explaining everything, somehow managing to coherently stammer together what had happened to Jacek and what Nick had revealed to me before taking me to the prison. \n\n“So you got your soul back? I’m so happy for—” Cas’ voice trailed off when he saw the look in my eyes. “Fuck.”\n\n“I need to do this, and fast. I need to get everything sorted, I can’t… If I don’t see him again, if I don’t see Jacek again, I think I’m gonna die or something…” I confessed in a shaky voice, clenching my hands into fists to keep my fingers from trembling. \n\n“Okay,” Cas said simply. “Okay, we can… we can do this. Don’t worry. Everything’s gonna be okay.”\n\n“You just said okay thrice and I still don’t believe you.”\n\n“No, no, it will be, trust me. So… Jem. What do we do with Jem?”\n\n“Yeah, what do we do with Jem?” Jeremy echoed.\n\n“I haven’t seen you in so long,” Cas remarked, still in utter disbelief. “What the hell did you do?”\n\n“The princess told you already.” Jem gestured at me, lifting a haughty brow. “No need to get into the nitty gritty of things.”\n\n“Oh, you think?” Casimir shot back, shaking his head. “No, no, no, you’re gonna tell me what the fuck you did.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“You’ve been gone for years. You ran out on me, on all of us, you just vanished; and now, you’re apparently dead and also a serial killer?” Cas let out a soft gasp of incredulity, still shaking his head frantically. “Are you seriously blaming me for wanting to know what in God’s name happened to my brother?”\n\nJem shrugged. “Well, I offed a bunch of sluts, and that’s that. Nothing more to it, to be honest.”\n\nIt was hard to keep my composure at his words. Looking at him, I didn’t even feel like I was facing my younger brother, but a complete stranger. Jem regarded me with a strangely detached expression, like he didn’t care about seeing us at all. Like he didn’t care about anything. I suppose it made sense; he’d spent the last couple years incarcerated in the hellsphere of Envy, being consistently tortured. I doubt anyone would be able to muster up a lot of emotion after something like that. But he was still the same man who, while alive, had apparently committed a series of murders. I would be lying if I said I didn’t want to know what exactly had happened.\n\n“I know you want to ask, and you should know that I don’t want to answer,” Jem stated. “If you want a story about me, ask that prick Hettmann.”\n\n“Don’t talk about Jacek like that.”\n\n“Oh, come off it, you spoiled brat. Do what you gotta do and don’t waste my time.”\n\n“You have an eternity of torture waiting for you!” I argued in bewilderment.\n\n“I’d prefer the cell to having to look at you all day,” he growled.\n\n“How the fuck can you even say that? What’s wrong with you?”\n\n“Stop it, Fiona. Just stop. I won’t talk to you. I’d rather eat my own shit than talk to you.”\n\nI took several deep, steadying breaths. “Fine. So I guess there’s nothing left to say. Cas, where’s Aleksei?”\n\n“He stepped outside there for a moment, I’ll go get him,” Casimir offered, quick to stand up and make his way over to the door. When he passed me, I noticed that his fists were clenched to the point of his knuckles turning white. \n\nI swallowed thickly as I turned to avoid my other brother’s gaze. “I should get you something to cover up,” I remarked, moving to get up myself. \n\n“You do that,” Jem called after me as I went upstairs. \n\nI couldn’t stand staying with him for another second. \n\nI spontaneously decided to rifle through Casimir’s belongings for some clothes, making a mental note to ask forgiveness later. I found some sweatpants and a t-shirt, and just as I turned around, my breath caught in my throat. Jeremy was standing in the doorway, directly blocking my path. His lips were curled into a gentle, reassuring smile, which would have been a nice enough sight if it were to have reached his eyes. He lifted his head, tilting it to one side, then the other, considering me. \n\n“Hey again.”\n\n“Get out of the way,” I immediately said, puffing my chest out and fixing my eyes on his. I couldn’t let him see how much he was scaring me just by standing nearby.\n\n“In a minute. Fiona, I changed my mind. I do wanna share what I did after all.”\n\nI didn’t like his tone. My eyes flitted to his hand and I stifled a shocked yell when I spotted the knife he was holding. He must have gotten it from the kitchen. I instantly realized I’d made a big mistake; I should have never let him out of my sight. Fuck.\n\n“I wanna show you,” Jeremy said, almost sweetly, as he proceeded into the room. \n\n“Jeremy, drop that,” I warned him. “Don’t do anything stupid.”\n\n“What, you think I care? They’re gonna torture me down there anyways, might as well have some fun up here. Make it worth it,” he explained with a carefree shrug. \n\nI backed off, nearly tripping over my own feet. “Cas is gonna be back in a moment. He won’t be alone.”\n\n“That’s fine. A moment’s all I need, really.” Another step towards me.\n\nMy back was pressed up against the wall by now. \n\n“God, I actually dreamed of this, you know,” he whispered almost reverently as he closed the distance between us and lifted the blade to my neck, not cutting, just… caressing.\n\nI stared into his gleaming eyes, searching, looking for something I slowly realized was gone. “Why?” I breathed.\n\n“You actually have no idea, do you? You have no idea what it was like for us. I did the exact same thing as Casimir is still doing, you know. Well, not *exactly* the same, but I know he’d understand if he only admitted it to himself.” He dropped his arm, grabbing onto my skirt as if moving to lift it. I didn't want to see where he was going with this. In one swift movement, I tossed the bundle of clothes I was still holding into his face, then kicked him in the crotch with all my might. Jeremy cried out, dropping the knife, and I hurried to pick it up before boring towards the exit, slamming the door shut behind me as my brother howled in fury. At the very same moment, I heard Cas and Aleksei come back inside.\n\n\"Help!\" I shouted, straining to hold the door shut. Jem was trying to tear it open from the inside. \"Up here!\"\n\nCasimir was by my side in an instant, the Leshy on his heel. Aleksei was in his human form, coughing heavily as he dragged himself up the stairs, his powerful frame slightly hunched. Still, when I let go of the doorhandle and Jem came staggering out, the man with the cudgel was able to subdue him with ease. Chest heaving, I stared at my murderous brother, still naked, lying unconscious on the floor. \n\nCas gently placed a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1095w2g/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_freak_deer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a5ij3/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10b1dy9/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cac2n/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10dbk6i/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_devil/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ebyr1/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_sauna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fa2ec/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h64is/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_aleksei/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 18](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10i0d0p/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_when_shit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "I just needed a moment alone, a place where I would have peace and rest in my head for just a few hours. So, I went to the forest. I am pretty lucky, because there is a huge forest about 30 minutes from me and my girlfriend’s house. \n\nI walked for about an hour or two, so I was deep down in the forest. I took a moment to stand still and take in my surroundings. For the first time this week, I was truly relaxed. Everywhere I looked there were trees. I was surrounded by nature. Hearing nothing else than the chirping of the birds and the eternal sound of the wind rushing through the trees was refreshing and helped me to cope with all the things going on in my head. I haven’t seen a single soul in my two hour walk, which felt awesome but also a little disturbing, given the fact that I felt like I was being stared at the whole time. I touched my hip for a brief moment to feel the calming touch of my hunters knife and relaxed again. I have never hunted an animal in my entire life, but always took the knife with me for comfort and safety. I continued my walk and after half an hour I entered a little more open area and was stunned by the view. To the right and behind me was now the forest I just left and on my left side was a beautiful open field radiating green in the blazing sun. It  stretched for what looked like eternity. \n\nI was enjoying the view when all of the sudden I heard a faint panting like noise from behind me, and that’s when I saw him. A grey wolf, looking right at me, from only 5 meters away. My heart jumped and it cost me everything not to run away or draw my knife, which were definitely the worst 2 options. I tried to stay as still and calm as possible, while avoiding too much eye contact. I know wolves aren’t a direct threat to humans, especially not on their own, but I still felt drastically intimidated. I tried to take a moment to take in the situation, but I was so overwhelmed by the wolves appearance that my mind didn't quite work. *But at least I am still alive*, I thought. The wolf looked fierce and relentless, but at the same time wise and harmless. *He is probably just curious*, I told myself. *Just stay calm and you'll be okay.* The wolf had beautiful grey fur and light blue eyes. For a long moment I just stood there, observing the gorgeous creature, which was beaming with an expression I couldn't describe differently than calmness, power, pride and understanding. The wolf didn’t move a single muscle either. \n\nIt didn’t look like it was considering harming me, which I thought was a good sign*,* so I tried to do the same and show some respect. I was afraid of what would happen if I walked away. Also the wolf gave me some sense of calmness that I didn’t want to lose. Slowly, I lowered to one knee. Cautiously I reached my arm towards the wolf. It turned its head, as if considering. We stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, though it was probably only a few minutes. Then the wolf slowly started approaching me. *Stay calm, stay calm,* I kept repeating to myself.\n\nWhen he was about halfway my human instincts got the better of me and I met its gaze. It instantly stopped short and bared its teeth, giving a growl, a deep and menacing sound that reverberated through my bones and sent a shiver up my spine. My heart rate went skyrocketing. I immediately returned my gaze to the ground beneath me while lowering my head and somehow managed not to stumble backwards despite my fright. *Stupid kid, what were you thinking?* I said in my head. It didn’t make any more growls and continued its approach even more slowly and cautiously than before. Still looking down, I could tell it was right in front of me. I didn’t dare to move any muscle, knowing any small movement would be offending and would probably get me killed.\n\n*Why am I doing this?,* I thought. \n\nBut at the same time: \n\n*This is awesome!*\n\nThen something happened that I'll never forget. I felt the sensation of the wolf sniffing my handpalm. It continued doing so for a few seconds. That was when it must have noticed my hunters knife. I have know idea why it didn’t see it earlier, but it did now. It jumped back a couple meters, growling even more fiercefull than before, bearing its teeth once again. My head jumped up, and I followed its gaze to my right hip. *Now I'm in some serious trouble,* I thought.\n\nVery carefully I raised my left hand while trying to release the knife holder with my right. I was afraid of how it would look to the wolf, but I had to get rid of that cursed thing that just ruined everything. *Come on, come on, just get off my freaking belt.* Apparently the wolf interpreted my fidgeting with the knife holder otherwise. It suddenly jumped towards me with an astounding speed. My instincts took over completely and I wasn't in control when my hand took the knife out of its holder at an inhuman speed, pointing it forward. It felt like watching a movie, a terrible movie. I'll never forget the feeling of the skin of the wolf's chest giving way to my knife. Seconds later everything went black. I must have passed out because of the tremendous stress. \n\nSuddenly I woke up and when I opened my eyes, the wolf was laying on me. It wasn’t moving. Then I noticed the warm and wet flow on my right hand and realized what had just happened. A wave of noussia, disgust and anger surged through me and I threw the wolf off me, which cost more power than I expected. I looked to the wolf, to the beautiful deep blue eyes whose lights had gone out and to the grey fur which was soaked in red blood around its chest. I screamed. I cried. And I cuddled him. For hours on end, I stayed with him, crying in its fur. I have never felt more helpless. It sounds ridiculous, but in those few minutes I had been with the creature, I got more attached to him than I could have ever imagined.\n\nI must have cried for hours, because when I heard my girlfriend's voice, the sky was pitch black.\n\n“Johnny, Johnny”. My girlfriend’s voice. It sounded faint but still warm and comforting. I looked up. My girlfriend, the love of my life, was looking right at me, sitting next to me. She looked surprised and shocked about the scene she had arrived at. I threw my arms around her and a new wave of tears filled my eyes. But it did help a lot to have an acuel living being to cuddle again. Man, I love her. She told me she went looking for me since I wasn’t answering my phone and I had been gone for nearly 8 hours. After consoling me for at least 30 minutes I started telling her what had happened. She was shocked, but grateful that I was still alive. \n\n'I, I didn't mean to hu, hurt him.' I sobbed. 'I know', she said, pushing her forehead against mine. When I was a little more calm, she asked, full of empathy: ‘What would you like to do with him?” “I have no idea”, I admitted. Eventually we decided to carefully drag him into the forest and bury him under the leaves. After that we went back home.\n\nThat night, still being very upset, I fell asleep in my girlfriend's arms, the most comforting place in the entire world.",

        "text": "After [last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/), I was nervous to show up for work today, to say the least. I knew Corporate would be there today, and I considered calling out, but I decided against it. I was scheduled with Samuel, and I needed to see if I could get some answers out of him. So you can imagine my surprise when I showed up to find Corey talking to Daniel in the office. They both turned and smiled at me when I walked in, and I had to force myself to look away from Corey to clock in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good morning, Harper! Are you feeling better today?” Daniel asked, and I noticed he was sweating. Clearly, Corey’s present was making everyone a bit on edge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine. I thought you were off today?” I asked, trying to avoid Corey’s stare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh yeah, I’m not staying long, I just wanted to go over our numbers with Corey here.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’ve been doing quite well, Harper,” she said, and I could’ve sworn she was taunting me somehow. “For someone rather new, you show real potential.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thanks. I should get out there,” I mumbled, quickly running to the floor, where I nearly ran into Sam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good morning,” I said, looking up at him. He was visibly unsettled, and walked past me like he didn’t even know I was there. “Alright then…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started sweeping the floor, but I heard Corey’s loud laughter from the back. I was feeling nosey, so I decided to eavesdrop (don’t judge, I was tasked with learning more information, alright?). I stood in the fitting room closest to the curtain and listened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t get what the big deal is, Sam, I just asked. You don’t have to say yes,” Corey said, clearly sounding amused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’re not dragging me back down there. I’m doing great work here, and you know it. I mind my own business, keep my numbers up, and don’t make a mess,” Sam shouted, loud enough for me to hear it without straining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sam, relax, you don’t need to yell. She’s not transferring you, right Corey?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a tense pause after Daniel’s question, and I found myself holding my breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Not now. The warehouse is fully staffed at the moment, but I have a feeling we might be losing some employees soon. I’ll let you know if anything changes,” she replied threateningly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard footsteps approaching and quickly grabbed the broom and pretended to be sweeping. Sam walked out, not even noticing me, and began reorganizing the floor. Corey walked out shortly after him, smirking, and stood by the desk watching him. I snuck my way to the back without them noticing and caught Daniel packing up his things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Heading out?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, I gotta catch the bus,” he replied, clearly in a rush. I don’t know why, but I suddenly had a thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey, do you know Eleanora?” I held my breath, half expecting him to call Corey in and drag me away to some secret lair where I’d be tortured until I told them what happened last night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Who?” he asked, not even looking up. “Is that a client? What does she want?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, half shocked and half convinced he was lying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So you don’t know anyone named Eleanora?” I asked again, trying to get his attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe finally looked at me, and I could tell he was sincere, and also irritated. “No, Harper, sorry but I don’t have time for riddles. Was there an issue with something she purchased? Nevermind, just talk to me about it tomorrow. I’ll see you later.” And with that, he rushed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood for a second, processing this very brief but informative interaction. Daniel had no idea who Eleanora was, or simply didn’t know our building had a name. There is a chance he was lying, but I’ve seen him lie before, and honestly, he’s pretty bad at it. I didn’t have too much time to ponder this discovery, because Corey came bouncing in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Ready to work?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to stop myself from rolling my eyes, and I gave her my best fake smile and followed her out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were actually rather busy, and I didn’t get an opportunity to pull Sam aside until we were closed and prepping for our custom. Corey walked out from the office, bag in hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright guys, great work today. I’m heading out, but I’ll see you tomorrow, Harper!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, you’re coming back?” I felt how sharp this came out, and judging by the way her face began melting into a scowl, she felt it too. “I mean, you’re going to be here tomorrow? Is everything alright?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seemed she believed my feigned concern, as her face quickly returned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh yes, everything is fine, I’m just having so much fun working with you guys! It can get so boring in my stuffy office, it’s great to work with real people again! See you tomorrow!” She basically skipped out the front door and down the stairs, and her peppiness made me nauseous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“God, could she be any more fucking obnoxious?” I asked, mostly to myself, but Sam heard and snorted a little laugh. I snapped my head towards him, and he quickly composed himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need to understand how crazy this was. I’ve known this person for a whole year, and I’ve never once seen him smile, let alone laugh, if he wasn’t trying to charm a client. The fact that I actually made him laugh was progress if I’ve ever seen it, and I decided to take advantage of this opening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We have an hour before our custom, so I’m gonna have some tea. Want some?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe sat on the couch talking shit about Corey for an entire hour, and it was genuinely a good time. Sam is much less intimidating when he is smiling, and he seemed to appreciate my talent for pointing out the slightest fault in our boss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How can you not know the difference between chinos and fucking trousers? You are the head boss for a fucking clothing store, lady!” I said between laughs, and Sam cracked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I honestly don’t understand how she got this job in the first place. Well, I *know* how she got this job, but still. They should have looked into what she knows before what she can do.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked, trying to be nonchalant and sipped my tea. He suddenly got serious, and I could see him considering something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I know you’ve felt it. You have this sixth sense thing going on, so I know you’re not stupid. You can feel it when you look in her eyes, can’t you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded my head solemnly, and this confirmed my suspicions. She had some way of influencing people's thoughts and actions, either from eye contact or touch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Her tricks don’t work on the owner, of course, but she could sense Corey’s power from a mile away. That’s why she hired her. Corey can make any employee do anything she wants with the slightest touch.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, we have an owner?” This information was completely new to me. I mean, of course I assumed someone owned us, but I figured it was some corporation and we were a simple speck in their line of various businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wow, you don’t know a lot about this place, do you?” he laughed, and got up to clean his mug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quickly followed, desperate to learn more. “No, I really don’t, but I’d love to know anything you can tell me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe eyed me suspiciously. “Why?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This is my job! I’m here everyday, and I’d like to know what kind of company I’m representing,” I said, trying to sound genuine, but failing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe rolled his eyes. “It’s better if you just do your job and cash your checks. You don’t need anything else to be a good worker.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe quickly moved past me, but I wasn’t done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What about Eleanora?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe froze in his tracks, and slowly turned his head towards me. “What did you just say?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So you know.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe marched right up to my face and bent so we were eye to eye. “What. Did. You. Just. Say.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Eleanora,” I whispered, feeling fear tightening my throat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe rose back up, and examined me carefully. “How do you know her name?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swallowed hard, not sure if I could trust him. “I don’t know, I just do.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You shouldn’t be talking about her. It’s dangerous, especially with Corey around. Don’t bring this up again. I don’t want to be dragged into your shit.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, the door opened and our custom client for the evening, Jaque, sauntered in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you guys like to hear about my custom clients, and Jaque is one of the newer shoppers with us. He is technically my client, since I helped him the first time he came in a few months ago, so he has a preference for me. Most of the other clients I work with have been helped by either Sam or Daniel for years before I was around, so I just fill in on their days off. Jaque is one of my favorite clients to help because not only is he much less picky when it comes to colors and fabrics, but because he seems to be one of the more harmless clients I deal with. Jaque, of course, is a Mime. I know, it feels like a stereotype, but this guy is made for the Mime life. I know it’s because he is some sort of supernatural being, but it is still incredible to watch him do his thing. Watching him walk up an imaginary wall to get a feel for the mobility of the pants he wants to buy? For no reason other than to entertain me? That’s a real man. Seeing him in his face paint, checking his fake watch instantly brought me out of the panic attack I was about to succumb to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Jaque!” I said excitedly, and he over-acted being surprised and delighted to see me. He gave me double cheek kisses, then tapped his fake watch, acting annoyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I know, I know, I’m sorry. We were finishing up some stock stuff in the back. But we’re here now!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJaque glanced behind me, and I watched as Sam briskly walked out the door and left. Jaque and I looked at each other, and I put on my best *it’s fine* smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Looks like it’s just you and me tonight, sir!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe waved off my formality and pretended to put on a fancy coat, top hat, and walked around with an invisible cane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed lightly. “I see, time for a new suit?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was ringing him up, he looked around dramatically and slipped me a $20 bill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh, Jaque, I can’t-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe held up his hand, zipped his mouth shut and locked it, lovingly placing the pretend key in my hand. He gave me a warm smile before a giant gust of wind seemed to come out of nowhere and blow him out the door, giving me no time to refuse. I smiled at the bill in my hand, dotted with black and white paint, when I noticed tiny writing on the back of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She needs your help.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/)",

        "text": "It was the knocking that came first.  \nIt happened often, without rhyme or rhythm. Different days, different times of the day, the only thing that was the same was it only happened when I was alone.  \nThe first time, was during the middle of the day. I had been in the kitchen, chopping vegetables for the slow cooker, radio humming faintly as I worked.   \nThe knock was so loud, so unexpected that I had startled, dropping the knife out of my hands and letting it clatter noisly on the tiled floor.   \nBy the time I got my breath back and made my way to the door, I was greeted by no one.   \nI'd glanced around, eyes scanning for a parcel or something, assuming without much of a thought that it could be anyone apart from a delivery driver.   \nThere was nothing, I went inside with a shrug and forgot about it. Until it happened again.   \nThis was at night time, Ry had picked up a late shift so I decided on a bath and an early night in. I'd slipped into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin and was on the brink of falling asleep when I heard it again.   \nMy stomach turned, instinct telling me something wasn't quite right, but I shook my head and ignored it, telling myself that someone could be needing help, not to be so silly. gathering my dressing gown and pulling it tight around myself , I bound down the stairs. The porch light on, I asked who was there before opening the door. I have seen enough slasher movies to know the drill.   \nBut no reply came.   \nThe gut feeling came back, how odd it was that someone would knock the same loud knock, and both times there would be no one there. Once maybe.. But twice? And in the middle of the night?   \nMy house wasn't exactly rural, but the properties weren't close either, and it wasn't really the place where people walked around the neighborhood so late at night, especially to knock on the door and just.. Run away?   \nI brought it up to Ry the next morning, and he smiled into his cornflakes. \"I don't mean to make light of it babe, but in sure it was just a possum or some little punk playing practical jokes. Anyway, it mustn't have scared you too much, you were snoring like a freight train when I got home.\"  \nThe phone calls came next.   \nI would answer, and no one was on the other line. After a few moments of static silence, the line would go dead.   \nOne morning Ry asked me why the home phone was unplugged. I hadn't told him about the calls, too be honest I felt like he wouldn't have truly believed me, brushing it off like he did before. And I was right.   \n\"It's been such A stressful year for you, hasn't it my darling?\" his voice was gentle with pity. Pity for me, or for the situation I am in, I didn't know, nor do I ask. \"I think that sometimes when our minds are over worked we can end up seeing things not quite as they are,or even doing things that seem a bit.. Impulsive.\" he was referring to the arm chair, I wanted to scream. \"have you ever considered why it only happens when I'm not home? I'm not saying I don't believe you, of course I believe that you think..\"  \nI stopped listening and just nodded now and then. It didn't matter what he said, I knew he was not on my side.   \nAt work, I mentioned it to a few of my colleagues, as we sat around the smoking area during lunch. There was an awkward silence, eyes downcast avoiding contact as they took a drag of their cigarettes.   \nIt was Mel who spoke first, her voice soft with kindness.  \n\"I'm sure Ry's right. I'm sure it's just some bored and brainless teenage prankster, trying to entertain themselves over the school holidays. I know my nephews can be right little buggers\"  Mel's smile was warm, and I realized then that she almost believed me, while the others thought I was making it up.   \nIt shocked me for a moment, and indignation began to burn in my chest. First Ry and now people who see me every day at work don't belive me?   \nInstead I focused on how I felt grateful to Mel for lightening the situation, and returned her smile. I wanted desperately to say that it wasn't even school holidays, and my phone number wasn't listed so how exactly did a prankster teen aquire that? But there was no point, the fact she sort of believed me felt like enough. And, I realised I probably sounded a bit insane, so I didn't want to prove anyone right. It was better to keep things to myself for now.   \nLater as we all walked back inside to our desks, I mouthed a silent 'thank you' to Mel, who nodded her head in solidarity.   \nRy was away visiting family, and it had been impossible for me to get time off, so I was home alone for the week.   \nThe first nights were fine, no random knocks, no bumps in the night. I was beginning to have hope that Ry and Mel had been right, it was really just a bored kid or worse, I had some kind of mental break and I'd imagined it all.   \nOn the third day I got home from work and unlocked the front door. I had just been grocery shopping, my arms were full of produce in brown paper bags. One moment I unlocked the front door, and stepped inside the dark room, promptly tripping over something blocking the doorway, sending my groceries scattering up the hallway. I fumbled for the light switch, breathless and a bit winded from the fall. In the middle of my entry way, sat a massive lazy-boy armchair. Cream leather, plush. It must have cost a few grand, at least.   \nIt didn't make sense. I knew I hadn't ordered it, but Ry? Surely he would of told me if he was making such an expensive purchase.. But even if he didn't, how did it end up inside when I had been at work all day, and Ry was out of the state?  \nI pulled my phone from my jeans pocket, fingers trembling as I scrolled through my contacts and got to Ry's name.   \n\"Hey honey, I'm just at the fair, we've been on the dodgems at least 5 times, and you should've seen - \"   \n\"Did you order a lazy boy?\" my voice comes out harder than I expected and I wince at its harshness.   \n\"A what?\"   \n\"A chair Ry. A fucking lazy boy arm chair. Did you order it or not?\" I felt like an asshole but anxiety and fear was wearing my patience thin. Please say yes, please say yes, please say -   \n\"No.\" there was a long pause, \"look.. I know you're going through some.. Stuff, right now.. If you've spend some of the savings I'm not going to be mad, but there's no need to play games and make pretend. You know you can tell me anything. I'm worried about you.\"   \n\"I know Ry. I haven't been having a great time. But I'm okay, promise. Say hi to your mum and dad, okay. I've gotta go.\" I end the call before he can say anything else and close my eyes tightly. This does not make sense.   \nI leave the groceries where they are, not allowing myself to think, and take a glass of wine into the bedroom. I lay on the bed, staring at the TV without paying attention, sipping on the wine slowly.  \nI am drifting off when the knock comes. I jolt awake, the red wine tumbling out of my hands and onto my white bed cover. I rush down stairs, surprised I don't slip and fall, but not caring either. I need to get to the door before they go. I need to know who they are, who is doing this to me.  \nI swing the door open, and there is no one there.   \nDefeated, I close the door slowly, leaning against it for a long moment after I hear it latch and lock in place.   \nWith a sigh and the start of a headache, I turn to make my way back to bed, and out of the corner of my eye, I notice it.   \nA doll, perched lazily on the lazy boy, as if it had been there all along.   \nMy heart was racing, my legs felt like jelly. I did not want to, but I needed, more than anything, to go over and inspect the doll.   \nIt reminded me of the doll I had as a child, one that was lost a very, very long time ago.  \nThe phone starts to ring.",

        "text": "After [last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/), I was nervous to show up for work today, to say the least. I knew Corporate would be there today, and I considered calling out, but I decided against it. I was scheduled with Samuel, and I needed to see if I could get some answers out of him. So you can imagine my surprise when I showed up to find Corey talking to Daniel in the office. They both turned and smiled at me when I walked in, and I had to force myself to look away from Corey to clock in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good morning, Harper! Are you feeling better today?” Daniel asked, and I noticed he was sweating. Clearly, Corey’s present was making everyone a bit on edge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine. I thought you were off today?” I asked, trying to avoid Corey’s stare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh yeah, I’m not staying long, I just wanted to go over our numbers with Corey here.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’ve been doing quite well, Harper,” she said, and I could’ve sworn she was taunting me somehow. “For someone rather new, you show real potential.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thanks. I should get out there,” I mumbled, quickly running to the floor, where I nearly ran into Sam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good morning,” I said, looking up at him. He was visibly unsettled, and walked past me like he didn’t even know I was there. “Alright then…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started sweeping the floor, but I heard Corey’s loud laughter from the back. I was feeling nosey, so I decided to eavesdrop (don’t judge, I was tasked with learning more information, alright?). I stood in the fitting room closest to the curtain and listened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t get what the big deal is, Sam, I just asked. You don’t have to say yes,” Corey said, clearly sounding amused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’re not dragging me back down there. I’m doing great work here, and you know it. I mind my own business, keep my numbers up, and don’t make a mess,” Sam shouted, loud enough for me to hear it without straining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sam, relax, you don’t need to yell. She’s not transferring you, right Corey?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a tense pause after Daniel’s question, and I found myself holding my breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Not now. The warehouse is fully staffed at the moment, but I have a feeling we might be losing some employees soon. I’ll let you know if anything changes,” she replied threateningly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard footsteps approaching and quickly grabbed the broom and pretended to be sweeping. Sam walked out, not even noticing me, and began reorganizing the floor. Corey walked out shortly after him, smirking, and stood by the desk watching him. I snuck my way to the back without them noticing and caught Daniel packing up his things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Heading out?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, I gotta catch the bus,” he replied, clearly in a rush. I don’t know why, but I suddenly had a thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey, do you know Eleanora?” I held my breath, half expecting him to call Corey in and drag me away to some secret lair where I’d be tortured until I told them what happened last night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Who?” he asked, not even looking up. “Is that a client? What does she want?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, half shocked and half convinced he was lying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So you don’t know anyone named Eleanora?” I asked again, trying to get his attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe finally looked at me, and I could tell he was sincere, and also irritated. “No, Harper, sorry but I don’t have time for riddles. Was there an issue with something she purchased? Nevermind, just talk to me about it tomorrow. I’ll see you later.” And with that, he rushed out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood for a second, processing this very brief but informative interaction.

Corey walked out from the office, bag in hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright guys, great work today. I’m heading out, but I’ll see you tomorrow, Harper!” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, you’re coming back?” I felt how sharp this came out, and judging by the way her face began melting into a scowl, she felt it too. “I mean, you’re going to be here tomorrow?

Did. You. Just. Say.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Eleanora,” I whispered, feeling fear tightening my throat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe rose back up, and examined me carefully. “How do you know her name?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swallowed hard, not sure if I could trust him. “I don’t know, I just do.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You shouldn’t be talking about her. It’s dangerous, especially with Corey around. Don’t bring this up again. I don’t want to be dragged into your shit.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, the door opened and our custom client for the evening, Jaque, sauntered in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you guys like to hear about my custom clients, and Jaque is one of the newer shoppers with us. He is technically my client, since I helped him the first time he came in a few months ago, so he has a preference for me. Most of the other clients I work with have been helped by either Sam or Daniel for years before I was around, so I just fill in on their days off. Jaque is one of my favorite clients to help because not only is he much less picky when it comes to colors and fabrics, but because he seems to be one of the more harmless clients I deal with. Jaque, of course, is a Mime. I know, it feels like a stereotype, but this guy is made for the Mime life. I know it’s because he is some sort of supernatural being, but it is still incredible to watch him do his thing. Watching him walk up an imaginary wall to get a feel for the mobility of the pants he wants to buy? For no reason other than to entertain me? That’s a real man. Seeing him in his face paint, checking his fake watch instantly brought me out of the panic attack I was about to succumb to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Jaque!” I said excitedly, and he over-acted being surprised and delighted to see me. He gave me double cheek kisses, then tapped his fake watch, acting annoyed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I know, I know, I’m sorry. We were finishing up some stock stuff in the back. But we’re here now!” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJaque glanced behind me, and I watched as Sam briskly walked out the door and left. Jaque and I looked at each other, and I put on my best *it’s fine* smile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Looks like it’s just you and me tonight, sir!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe waved off my formality and pretended to put on a fancy coat, top hat, and walked around with an invisible cane. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed lightly. “I see, time for a new suit?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was ringing him up, he looked around dramatically and slipped me a $20 bill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh, Jaque, I can’t-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe held up his hand, zipped his mouth shut and locked it, lovingly placing the pretend key in my hand. He gave me a warm smile before a giant gust of wind seemed to come out of nowhere and blow him out the door, giving me no time to refuse. I smiled at the bill in my hand, dotted with black and white paint, when I noticed tiny writing on the back of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She needs your help.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/)",

        "text": "So, this happened around 1 month ago. I and my friend... let's call him Andrew, so we were on our way to some place Andrew wanted to show me. I was not quite sure if I would like this place, cuz the previous place Andrew took me to, I... um... I didn't quite like it. I just hoped this place was good.\n\nSo Andrew is my best friend. We are more like brothers. We too are pretty much the same, just that he is a little more healthier than me. We met 2 years ago, and our friendship was quite unexpected for both is us. Anyway, back to the story, we liked to go cycling together. We didn't usually have a destination in mind. We would just roam around until we found a spot we liked, and that spot would become our base for the next few weeks. We would just abandon the previous base once we found a better spot. A few days back, we had a spot which we called \"Wammy's House,\" which I still don't know why. Gradually we lost interest in that place and wanted a new base, and Andrew is like a roamer, so he found a place, and now wanted to show it to me. So basically we had online school due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the schools were closed. So the online teaching started in the morning and ended at 3 in the afternoon. We completed the study and in the evening, he came over to my place and we headed for the new place he had found.\n\n\"Bruh, this better be a good place, cuz I don't want my efforts to get wasted. Plus, I really want a place where I can lie down and relax, just looking at the sky.\" I said.\n\n\"You are sure to love this place. This is just like our first base, that river, but just that this one is even better.\"\n\n\"I hope so...\"\n\nAnd it really was a super cool place.\n\nHe took me through a lot of twisted roads and we finally ended up at a really nice river. It had large rocks at the shore, where we could sit and relax, while looking at the water. The place was so calm, silent and peaceful, I almost felt I would fall asleep there any moment. It was really nice.\n\n[The River](https://preview.redd.it/elo2p7j4oz171.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7e911318e9e066a1dfd76c65de0964240abd9a12)\n\n\"Man... this place... it's frickin' awesome!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Told ya.\"\n\nWe spent the evening there, looking at the water and talking about stuff. It really was awesome. When the sun set and it was dark, we left for our homes. It was certain. This place was our new base.\n\nWe started going to the river really often now. Almost daily. We would go there, sit, lie down, talk about stuff, and then come back. I really loved the place.\n\nThen, one day, another common friend of ours, let's call him Tim, he came over to my place. He is another best friend. So we watched Death Note for a while, and then Andrew came over. We played something for sometime and then decided to take Tim to the river. So we grabbed our bicycles and rushed to the river.\n\n[The river that day](https://preview.redd.it/u50zjqraoz171.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7de3731801012b8f631f279f62ead7c09163ffb3)\n\nToday, it was even more awesome. The water had backed away a little, giving us more place to sit and walk. Yet, the the further part of water was still super deep, but we didn't care. We just hopped from one rock to the other and reached the furthermost rock where we lay down and talked.\n\nI had brought my phone too, so we started playing some music and it felt super awesome. Then we started walking in the shallow part of the water, and soon we found weird things. Like broken earphones from someone, a broken phone case, and such other stuff. So we decided we would try to find something valuable. After sometime, Andrew yelled, \"Hey Ray (me)! I think you dropped your ring over there!\" I still had my ring in my finger, so I told him to quit it, but he said he saw a ring over somewhere in the water. He then pointed a place between 2 rocks under the water and I and Tim went over there to see what it was.\n\n[The place Andrew pointed out](https://preview.redd.it/5pu3x507oz171.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=516406d2985677d401f928270ce0df3753cc8bd8)\n\nThough not mine, there really was a ring in the water. I picked it up and looked at it. It looked ancient. It was made of some metal I didn't really know, and it had weird designs on its sides. It also had a blue gem sort of thing at the top.\n\nThere was something about this ring. I felt super awesome looking at it. And I wanted to try it out. So I quickly wore the ring in my index finger. Andrew and Tim backed off a little and Andrew said, \"Bruh are you out of your mind? You shouldn't wear such things. I mean, we don't know where it came from. It might be cursed.\"\n\nI started laughing. \"Bruh you seriously think this is cursed or something? Dang it man! I am taking this ring with me!\" I said, laughing.\n\n\"Ray, I think Andrew is right... I mean, not cursed, but I don't think you should take this ring.\" said Tim.\n\n\"C'mon now. You too? I am taking this ring. That's final.\" I said, putting the ring in my pocket. They both shrugged it off and we continued chilling out on the rocks. Then when the sun set, we went back home. I slept in a different room, so I was alone in my room at night. I looked at the ring once before sleeping. For some reason, I was attracted to the ring. I couldn't stop looking at the ring. That was when I started feeling uneasy. The dim light in my room made things even worse. I was feeling negative. I kept the ring away in my drawer. I felt a little better now. Something told me it was because of that ring, but I didn't seem to want to believe it. I really wanted to keep that ring. I kept thinking about the ring and soon fell asleep.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n*I was on the same spot where I had found the ring, just this time I was alone. No Andrew, no Tim. I felt strange. I was alone, but I felt like someone was watching me. I looked down and saw the ring in the water, and picked it up. Something went through me, tearing me up and I fell in the water, dead.*\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n*Man that was scary!* I said to myself as I woke up with a start. I checked the clock and it was 3:42 AM. I still had a few hours to sleep. I curled up inside my blanket and slowly started drifting off to sleep, until I noticed the little weight on my index finger. I turned on the lights and I saw the ring.\n\n*What in the frickin' world?!* I thought. I was scared. I had put the ring inside the drawer. Then how was it here in my hand? I kept thinking, and drifted off to sleep after putting that ring in the drawer again.\n\nI woke up next morning, again to find the ring in my hand. I was starting to get freaked out now, so after having a bath, I messaged Sam, who was another one of my best friends. He lived a little away from me, Andrew, and Tim, so we only met at school. Tim didn't know Sam as Tim was in a different school than ours.\n\n\"Bruh Sam\"\n\n\"Yeah sup?\"\n\nI explained everything to him and sent him pictures of the ring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhgng96eoz171.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7fcb0719a7de94d855cf4b96571778630759b7df\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrlb8b6eoz171.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=20c53d11b28af420a4ce040615bafedc197ccd87\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/abd1df6eoz171.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3367e112112a44d6113773a8605b43af3219df61\n\n\"Bro, if what you just told me is true, I think this ring of yours is possessed.\" replied Sam.\n\n\"Oh c'mon now... you too?\" I said, even though I knew what he was saying might be the truth.\n\n\"Yeah. According to what you told me, it looks like this ring is some sort of possessed object.\"\n\n\"I will just throw it away then...\" and just as I sent this, my drawer shot open, and the electricity went out. I was alone in the house, as my parents were out for work and my sister was out of station. I was terrified. This ring was definitely dangerous. I wanted to run away, but I couldn't. Something held my body back, and the next second, I fainted.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI woke up to find my mom sitting besides my bed. My whole body was paining, and I had a fever. I was pretty goddamn sure that this was because of the ring. Mom explained me everything. She opened the door lock with her duplicate key and found me on the floor. My condition was not very serious, but I wasn't feeling well, and mom was worried. I still hadn't told them about the ring. And I didn't want to. I was afraid they would not believe me. But then what could I do?\n\nI grabbed my phone and found a ton of messages from Sam. I suddenly stopped chatting so he thought I died or something.\n\n\"Hey Sam\" I messaged.\n\n\"So finally you are here... came back from heaven?\"\n\n\"C'mon I wasn't dead.\"\n\n\"Anyway what happened to you?\"\n\nThen I explained everything to him.\n\n\"Bruh I don't think you should keep this ring for too long.\"\n\n\"Yeah me too... Ima throw it away.\"\n\n\"No don't. Like you mentioned, whenever you kept it in the drawer, it came back to your hand, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah so what? Tell me fast. I am scared.\"\n\n\"Go back to where you found it and keep it there itself. Maybe it may stop following you.\"\n\n\"Yeah maybe that will work. But I am not in a condition to even get up from the bed.\"\n\n\"Tell Andrew. He will help.\"\n\nAnd so I messaged Andrew and he was like, \"HOLY CRAP! I WAS JUST KIDDING BOUT THE CURSED THING! IT ACTUALLY IS CURSED?!\"\n\nAnd so next day Andrew came over. I showed him the ring. He kept staring at it. Then we talked a little, and then he left with the ring. Little did I know that it was the last time I was gonna see him.\n\nNext morning, I woke up. To my horror, I found the ring in my hand. I was scared out of my wits. I shouldn't have had taken it. I should've listened to Andrew and Tim. But what horrified me the most was what came next. I called Andrew to tell him what had happened, but his mom picked up the phone. She was crying. I asked her what the matter was and she told me that Andrew had an accident. A truck hit him on the road the day before and he..... **DIED ON THE SPOT.**\n\n\"WTF\" I said and ended the call. I couldn't believe it. Andrew. My best friend. The one who always supported me and helped me in everything. He was no longer alive. He... was dead. And all because of this damn ring. I wished I never had picked it up. Andrew wouldn't have died. None of this would've happened. It was all my fault.\n\nI looked at the ring in my hand. Somehow I felt like it stared back at me.\n\n(To be continued in part 2)",

Anyway, back to the story, we liked to go cycling together. We didn't usually have a destination in mind. We would just roam around until we found a spot we liked, and that spot would become our base for the next few weeks. We would just abandon the previous base once we found a better spot. A few days back, we had a spot which we called \"Wammy's House,\" which I still don't know why. Gradually we lost interest in that place and wanted a new base, and Andrew is like a roamer, so he found a place, and now wanted to show it to me. So basically we had online school due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the schools were closed. So the online teaching started in the morning and ended at 3 in the afternoon. We completed the study and in the evening, he came over to my place and we headed for the new place he had found.\n\n\"Bruh, this better be a good place, cuz I don't want my efforts to get wasted. Plus, I really want a place where I can lie down and relax, just looking at the sky.\" I said.\n\n\"You are sure to love this place. This is just like our first base, that river, but just that this one is even better.\"\n\n\"I hope so...\"\n\nAnd it really was a super cool place.\n\nHe took me through a lot of twisted roads and we finally ended up at a really nice river. It had large rocks at the shore, where we could sit and relax, while looking at the water. The place was so calm, silent and peaceful, I almost felt I would fall asleep there any moment. It was really nice.\n\n[The River](https://preview.redd.it/elo2p7j4oz171.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7e911318e9e066a1dfd76c65de0964240abd9a12)\n\n\"Man... this place... it's frickin' awesome!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Told ya.\"\n\nWe spent the evening there, looking at the water and talking about stuff. It really was awesome. When the sun set and it was dark, we left for our homes. It was certain. This place was our new base.\n\nWe started going to the river really often now. Almost daily. We would go there, sit, lie down, talk about stuff, and then come back. I really loved the place.\n\nThen, one day, another common friend of ours, let's call him Tim, he came over to my place. He is another best friend. So we watched Death Note for a while, and then Andrew came over. We played something for sometime and then decided to take Tim to the river. So we grabbed our bicycles and rushed to the river.\n\nToday, it was even more awesome. The water had backed away a little, giving us more place to sit and walk. Yet, the the further part of water was still super deep, but we didn't care. We just hopped from one rock to the other and reached the furthermost rock where we lay down and talked.\n\nI had brought my phone too, so we started playing some music and it felt super awesome. Then we started walking in the shallow part of the water, and soon we found weird things. Like broken earphones from someone, a broken phone case, and such other stuff. So we decided we would try to find something valuable. After sometime, Andrew yelled, \"Hey Ray (me)! I think you dropped your ring over there!\" I still had my ring in my finger, so I told him to quit it, but he said he saw a ring over somewhere in the water. He then pointed a place between 2 rocks under the water and I and Tim went over there to see what it was.\n\nThough not mine, there really was a ring in the water. I picked it up and looked at it. It looked ancient. It was made of some metal I didn't really know, and it had weird designs on its sides. It also had a blue gem sort of thing at the top.\n\nThere was something about this ring. I felt super awesome looking at it. And I wanted to try it out. So I quickly wore the ring in my index finger. Andrew and Tim backed off a little and Andrew said, \"Bruh are you out of your mind? You shouldn't wear such things. I mean, we don't know where it came from. It might be cursed.\"\n\nI started laughing. \"Bruh you seriously think this is cursed or something? Dang it man! I am taking this ring with me!\" I said, laughing.\n\n\"Ray, I think Andrew is right... I mean, not cursed, but I don't think you should take this ring.\" said Tim.\n\n\"C'mon now. You too? I am taking this ring. That's final.\" I said, putting the ring in my pocket. They both shrugged it off and we continued chilling out on the rocks. Then when the sun set, we went back home. I slept in a different room, so I was alone in my room at night. I looked at the ring once before sleeping. For some reason, I was attracted to the ring. I couldn't stop looking at the ring. That was when I started feeling uneasy. The dim light in my room made things even worse. I was feeling negative. I kept the ring away in my drawer. I felt a little better now. Something told me it was because of that ring, but I didn't seem to want to believe it. I really wanted to keep that ring. I kept thinking about the ring and soon fell asleep.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n*I was on the same spot where I had found the ring, just this time I was alone. No Andrew, no Tim. I felt strange. I was alone, but I felt like someone was watching me. I looked down and saw the ring in the water, and picked it up. Something went through me, tearing me up and I fell in the water, dead.*\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n*Man that was scary!* I said to myself as I woke up with a start. I checked the clock and it was 3:42 AM. I still had a few hours to sleep. I curled up inside my blanket and slowly started drifting off to sleep, until I noticed the little weight on my index finger. I turned on the lights and I saw the ring.\n\n*What in the frickin' world?!* I thought. I was scared. I had put the ring inside the drawer. Then how was it here in my hand? I kept thinking, and drifted off to sleep after putting that ring in the drawer again.\n\nI woke up next morning, again to find the ring in my hand. I was starting to get freaked out now, so after having a bath, I messaged Sam, who was another one of my best friends. He lived a little away from me, Andrew, and Tim, so we only met at school. Tim didn't know Sam as Tim was in a different school than ours.\n\n\"Bruh Sam\"\n\n\"Yeah sup?\"\n\nI explained everything to him and sent him pictures of the ring.\n\n\"Bro, if what you just told me is true, I think this ring of yours is possessed.\" replied Sam.\n\n\"Oh c'mon now... you too?\" I said, even though I knew what he was saying might be the truth.\n\n\"Yeah. According to what you told me, it looks like this ring is some sort of possessed object.\"\n\n\"I will just throw it away then...\" and just as I sent this, my drawer shot open, and the electricity went out. I was alone in the house, as my parents were out for work and my sister was out of station. I was terrified. This ring was definitely dangerous. I wanted to run away, but I couldn't. Something held my body back, and the next second, I fainted.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI woke up to find my mom sitting besides my bed. My whole body was paining, and I had a fever. I was pretty goddamn sure that this was because of the ring. Mom explained me everything. She opened the door lock with her duplicate key and found me on the floor. My condition was not very serious, but I wasn't feeling well, and mom was worried. I still hadn't told them about the ring. And I didn't want to. I was afraid they would not believe me. But then what could I do?\n\nI grabbed my phone and found a ton of messages from Sam. I suddenly stopped chatting so he thought I died or something.\n\n\"Hey Sam\" I messaged.\n\n\"So finally you are here... came back from heaven?\"\n\n\"C'mon I wasn't dead.\"\n\n\"Anyway what happened to you?\"\n\nThen I explained everything to him.\n\n\"Bruh I don't think you should keep this ring for too long.\"\n\n\"Yeah me too... Ima throw it away.\"\n\n\"No don't. Like you mentioned, whenever you kept it in the drawer, it came back to your hand, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah so what? Tell me fast. I am scared.\"\n\n\"Go back to where you found it and keep it there itself. Maybe it may stop following you.\"\n\n\"Yeah maybe that will work. But I am not in a condition to even get up from the bed.\"\n\n\"Tell Andrew. He will help.\"\n\nAnd so I messaged Andrew and he was like, \"HOLY CRAP! I WAS JUST KIDDING BOUT THE CURSED THING! IT ACTUALLY IS CURSED?!\"\n\nAnd so next day Andrew came over. I showed him the ring. He kept staring at it. Then we talked a little, and then he left with the ring. Little did I know that it was the last time I was gonna see him.\n\nNext morning, I woke up. To my horror, I found the ring in my hand. I was scared out of my wits. I shouldn't have had taken it. I should've listened to Andrew and Tim. But what horrified me the most was what came next. I called Andrew to tell him what had happened, but his mom picked up the phone. She was crying. I asked her what the matter was and she told me that Andrew had an accident. A truck hit him on the road the day before and he..... **DIED ON THE SPOT.**\n\n\"WTF\" I said and ended the call. I couldn't believe it. Andrew. My best friend. The one who always supported me and helped me in everything. He was no longer alive. He... was dead. And all because of this damn ring. I wished I never had picked it up. Andrew wouldn't have died. None of this would've happened. It was all my fault.\n\nI looked at the ring in my hand. Somehow I felt like it stared back at me. This ring was dangerous.\n\n(To be continued in part 2)",

        "text": "I'm sure everyone has had an imaginary friend. Whether it be a little girl, a little boy. We'd always grow out of them and eventually they wouldn't visit as much.\n\nMine wasn't like that, tho. Mr Snuffles was not my first friend, I remember Carla when I was 5. She had curly blonde hair and ocean blue eyes. Next was Marc when I was 9. He preferred me calling him Mars tho, no biggie. I was into space at the time as well.\n\nThen came Mr Snuffles. He wasn't exactly like the typical imaginary friend, Mr Snuffles was around 11 feet tall. He had a pale and slender frame to the point you could count his ribs exactly. He usually took refuge in my closet or under my bed or on particularly bad nights he would watch me by the windows. But sometimes when I felt nice I would clear up the corner of my rooms full of clothes for Mr Snuffles. \n\nMr Snuffles never left my side. I've grown attached to him over the years, He talks to me now but in... inhuman whispers, mumbles and gurgles. But I can still understand what he's saying for some reason. It's like a universal language.\n\nMr Snuffles would stay with me when my parents were fighting, When I needed help with my homework, when mom and dad forgot to cook, Snuffles would make me close my eyes and bring me to the closet world. There would be a big long table full of delicious food. I would eat it with Mr Snuffles and even tho he had no face I could tell he was smiling. \n\nI've been to multiple psychiatrists, but all of them said Mr Snuffles was just a \"coping mechanism\". But I don't care, they all just wanna take him away from me. He never left me like dad did. He never drowned himself like mama. He even covered my ears when mom threw the bottle at dad.\n\nThey're all getting concerned now. As time passes I feel like Mr Snuffles is not so imaginary anymore. Maybe it's because I'm going thru a midlife crises, being in my 30's with an imaginary friend isn't really the norm.\n\nIm approaching my 36th birthday now. Mr Snuffles said he's going to have to leave soon. But I don't want him to leave, he's all I got in this cruel stupid world. \n\nI know one way I can be with Mr Snuffles. Maybe if I leave this world I can stay with him forever in his. Mr Snuffles is heavily against this tho, so I've not been thinking about it. \n\nBut today is different, I can't find Mr Snuffles anywhere. He's still here I know it. The bear jaw he gave me years ago is still sitting in the middle of the pentagram I drew for him so he could go to his world faster. \n\nWell it's too bad now I guess. Maybe he's figured out I'm giving him to the thing keeping him out of my room on those bad nights. Maybe he knows I'm good with that entity that's watching him from the windows but that doesn't matter. I've got all I need to go there and take Mr Snuffles back.\n\nOnce I give 3 imaginary friends to the Dreamstalker I'll finally be reborn into a normal happy family. I'm sorry Mr Snuffles but I've come so far and I won't risk it for you.",

        "text": "The last time I visited my friend’s apartment, it was raining. The apartment was on the 5th floor of a walk-up, and as I climbed the stairs I had to awkwardly lean against the wall of the stairwell for balance, as I was struggling with a heavy package I was carrying in both arms. When I finally reached the 5th floor I managed to open the stairwell door with my elbow, and my wet shoes made a squelching sound on the carpeted hallway floor as I walked to the apartment door. \n\nAfter setting the package I’d been carrying down beside me, I fished the key out of my pocket and unlocked the door. Picking the package up again, I stepped into the apartment. Before closing the door behind me, I flipped the foyer light on with my elbow, then walked in a bit further and did the living room lights as well. Only then did I close the door behind me. This done, I walked into the living room and set the package down on the coffee table. Although the sun still wouldn’t set for another hour, the rain and overcast sky made it as dark as the night would be. Although the lights in the living room were on, there seemed to be a lingering gloom in the corners and the dark hallway which led to the rest of the apartment. Despite this, though, there weren’t many complaints I could make about the space. \n\nMy friend’s apartment was always a treat to visit, even when my friend, the main draw of the place, was not there. It was airy and spacious, with high ceilings and a row of tall windows on one wall overlooking the river. It was one of those incredible old Victorian places, with the original molding and woodwork still in perfect condition and the wide planks of the hardwood floor dark and glossy. But the best part was the art. My friend has an extensive art collection, and really tasteful too. Some really beautiful Italian tapestries. When they were away, which was often, they would get any packages due to arrive shipped to my place and I would bring them into the apartment directly. With them not there to buzz the delivery guys in, packages would often just be left in the front lobby, where they often mysteriously went missing. It was a bit of a hassle lugging the bigger ones over from my place, but I didn’t mind. My friend always paid when we went out to eat, so I figured it all evens out. And I got to look at the art too–on this visit, as almost all my visits, after putting down the package I turned to study one of the tapestries hanging on the walls. I could’ve turned on more lights to see them better, but I wasn’t going to stay for long. They were better in daylight, and I wanted to leave in time to get a bubble tea before the shop closed. \n\nEven as I looked at the tapestries, though, I found my gaze drawn out those big windows, the darkness of the early evening shallowed and diluted by the glow of the streetlights. My friend must have had the windows double-glazed, because while I saw the rain falling and cars passing, the apartment was silent. It was the kind of silence that seems to almost be a sound, when a place is so still and empty that it almost creates a hum of static. Leaning forward, I rested my forehead against the cool glass and watched the street. \n\nAfter a few minutes my forehead started to feel a little numb from the cold glass. I was just lifting my head from the window when I heard behind me a whistle. It wasn’t a loud whistle, or long. It sounded like someone in one of the rooms to the back of the apartment had whistled the first note of a tune without continuing it. I immediately froze, and a deep sense of dread crashed over me. I listened sharply to try to catch the sound again, because it had been just quiet enough that I started to doubt if I’d actually heard it. But as I stood there unmoving, all I heard was the static silence, which seemed to somehow get louder. Unblinkingly I stared at the window, but now not at the scene outside, but at the dim reflection of the room behind me in the glass, but it was too dim to make anything out clearly. Standing there frozen with dread, I tried to parse the source of my fear. If there was someone in the apartment, I felt, perhaps overconfidently, that I could handle it. But that sound was something—uncanny.\n\nAfter hearing nothing for some number of minutes or hours, though, I very slowly began to turn. As more and more of the apartment came into my view, my fear grew, my heart beating and beating. Finally I saw the dark hallway which led further into the apartment, and although it was just how it had been it made me sick with fear to look at.\n\nSlowly, very slowly, I began to move across the living room to the foyer and apartment door, staring into the dark of that hallway, staring, staring, staring—at any second I expected a figure to appear, a figure or—something, to appear—when I heard it again, two notes this time, no louder than before, and I knew somewhere down that dark hallway, something whistling, something down there in the dark, whistling, there was—stumbling, I ran backwards out of the living room, through the foyer, arms feeling blindly for the doorknob and staring, never taking my eyes off that dark hallway as I practically fell out the door, slamming it, turning to run to the stairwell and practically throw myself down it, glancing back up the stairs at every turn to look for something up there, behind me, not sure if I heard that whistle again or the echo of my sneakers squeaking on the floor as I ran. As I flew out of the doors of the lobby and onto the dim street I became aware that there were tears streaming down my face. I didn’t stop running until I ran into the grocery store a few blocks away.",

        "text": "  \n\nMy friend and I recently moved out to a house in the country, it’s sort of in a neighborhood, but each house is on probably an acre or more, and there is a good amount of tree coverage around. The privacy is… nice. Anyway, earlier tonight, my buddy was in his room doing his homework, the dogs had calmed down for the night, and I was doing dishes while talking to my girlfriend. She and I were having some dumb discussion, I can’t even remember what it was specifically. She was talking about something or other, and then I hear these three knocks on a window. \n\nI looked out the window in front of the sink and I saw my buddy’s laughing face right up against it. He said, “Hey Sarah! The back door’s locked! Let me in! I took the compost out!” I almost moved towards the back door to unlock it, without thinking, but then I looked to my left, saw the full compost container, and then looked back at him. His face had dropped. I knew he never came in to get it. I ran into my roommate’s room and said, “Dude, I just fuckin’ saw you outside!” He looked at me, said “Stop fucking with me,” and went back to writing whatever. I said, “I swear to god I’m not fucking with you. Come to the kitchen.” \n\nWe walked in, the lights were still on, and it was still pitch-black outside. He had brought his gun into the back room, opened the door, and looked out. “Bro there’s nothing fucking out there.” But I know. I know what I saw. I saw “him” out there. I pulled my buddy in by the arm. I didn’t want him to spend time out there. At this point I was nearly shitting myself in fear. I mean, wouldn’t you? I just, I don’t know what to do. What would you? I have to leave the house again eventually. \n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen something off either, but it is the first time we’ve been sober. The other night we were quite a few hard ciders deep, watching a movie. I was half falling asleep and looked out the window to see a large white dog crouched in the yard looking in. I said “Oh my god! Hugo’s outside! Let’s go say hi!” Hugo is the neighbor’s dog, a large Great Pyrenees who is incredibly sweet and loveable but is not allowed to leave his fence a lot, understandably, so seeing him was a big deal. I got up as fast as I was able to, to get to the door five feet away. Once I opened it and looked at where the dog was, it was gone. This is a time difference of about 10 seconds, and there was no trace of him outside. It freaked us out, and then we let it go. *He* let it go. I haven’t. Especially not after tonight.\n\nIt may not be the same caliber as what happened tonight, not as serious, but both freak me the fuck out. I love my roommate. He’s my best friend in the whole world, and I’ve known him forever, but I can’t stay here much longer. I fear for both mine and his life.",

        "text": "Hello ya'll, i'll try and keep on track as best as I can.\n\nI work for an armed security company. We handle normal contracts along with the oddball contracts that nobody ever wants to pick up, which happens quite often. I've been working here for about a month now, and i've been encouraged by family and friends to share my experiences with you all. \n\nTo start this off, i'm no small girl, i'm 5'11 and grew up on a farm. After my parents kicked me out at the ripe age of 18, I had been bouncing from job to job for a while, going from blue collar to working in an office, taking calls and helping customers.  However, due to my supervisor being a dick over a comment i made to a rude customer, i was let go. It wasn't even that bad. After this,  I went on craigslist to look for a better job, when this offer caught my eye: \n\n\"Wanted: Nightshift Armed Security Guard.\nNeeding a reliable officer that can follow simple rules and be able to react to threats calmly.\nHours will be 5:30 P.M to 6:30 A.M. Monday-Friday. Overtime is 2.5x. Hourly rate: 35/hr. CALL: 889-332-8976\" \n\nI couldn't believe my eyes when i saw the ad, and i quickly called the number to schedule an interview. A tired voice picked up, and the call went as follows: \n\nMe: \"Hello, my name is Samantha, and i was wondering if the position for your nightshift security was still available?\"\n\nThe man introduced himself as James, head of security, then followed up with: \"Ah yes, we need a new hire, and fast. I have a couple questions before we get started, if you don't mind.\" \n\nMe: \"Go right ahead, i'm an open book\"\n\nJ: \"Question one, are you a felon or have a violent criminal history?\"  I replied to the negative, and he continued: \"Question 2: Have you, at any time, had or have panic attacks or any type of PTSD?\"\n\nI answered to the negative again. He said that I could come to the site for an in-person interview, and asked if i owned my own gun. I answered to the affirmative, and he gave me the address, telling me to go to a little grey metal shed near the building. \n\nJames seemed normal while i was speaking with him, so i didn't have any real suspicions until i put in the address on my laptop. It came up as an old nursing home, still semi-active. I asked if it was the right place, and he told me yes, that it was just a little run down due to no contractors being able to fix the outside. As we were wrapping things up,   he told me to be there a little bit before 5:30, as he did not want to conduct an interview past sundown. I thank him for his time and give my goodbyes, then end the call. Something just felt off though, so I decided to bring along my .45 just to be safe, in case this offer ended up like those craigslist stories. 5:00 rolled around rather quick, so i got ready and hopped in my car and started driving, thinking about what if it ended up being a ruse. Keeping my thoughts down, i'd resolved to just stick it out. I turned down a gravel path, looking around as i pulled up to the property after 20 minutes of driving. Fields of grass surrounded this place, the main building and a concrete parking lot being the only real civilization for miles. The nursing home was a bit more run down than it looked, the once proud red bricks now faded to a sickly pink, the windows dirty on the outside with vines growing up around them. It gave the whole property the impression of both rustic and ill-cared for. Looking sround some more,  I spotted a few beat up cars in the lot, the only newer one there had the security company's logo on the side. Waiting for a second, i took a deep breath,  got out of my car, and saw one of the nursing staff still in the building looking out at me through one of the filthy windows, staring as if surprised i came out there. \n\n\nI breathed a sigh, and made my way to the little grey building a little ways away. Once there i got this eerie feeling that maybe i should turn around and go home. However, i mustered up some courage, and I knocked on the door. The same voice that i heard earlier, rang out with a cold: \"Who's there?\"  I replied with: \"It's me, Samantha, your new hire\".  \n\nAfter a few minutes, the lock clicked open, the door swinging open to reveal a short and stocky man in a security guard's uniform. His beady eyes locked onto me as if trying to set me on fire. \n\nMe: \"James, right?\"\n\nThe man squinted at me, then nodded his head, motioning for me to come inside. I stepped onto the shed, and saw a table with two office chairs on either side, a monitor on the same wall as a window with a black desk underneath it. He pointed at an office chair and told me to have a seat.\n\nJames then placed a contract in front of me that read as follows: \n\n\"Dear employee, thank you for choosing T.S.S as your employer. Our number one priority is the customers we serve. Due to the nature of this occupation, T.S.S will be waived of all liability on the date signed below.  You will be paid 35 dollars an hour, non negotiable. Your overtime will be 2.5 times for every hour over 40 you reach. \n\nHours are: 5:30 P.M to 6:30 A.M, a total of 13 hours. Monday-Friday. \n\nCalling in sick is encouraged, as any slight in your perception could have dire consequences.\n\nIf this system is abused, you will be immediately terminated without investigation.  Other forms of time off must be made 2 weeks in advance except for; Loss of family member OR Loss of Signifigant other. This will fall under sick leave.\n\nThank you for choosing T.S.S, \n\n[REDACTED]\"\n\nI looked up at James, and found that his steel-like eyes were locked onto me, waiting with baited breath to see if i would sign.  I grabbed the pen out of my pocket, and signed on the dotted line.\n\nJames then snatched the paper from the table and filed it, briskly walking to his file cabinet, then a tall metal cabinet. He opened the creaking door, then started pulling a uniform out from it, it looking the exact same as his. A grey long sleeved service shirt, black combat pants, and a vest with the company's logo on the front and back.  He set my new clothes on the table in a small pile, along with a duty belt and combat boots.  Briskly walking over to the door, he tells me to put the clothes on, as he's out of time to leave. His worried expression being reflected in the black metal of the door. He looks back at me for a second, and says:  \"There's a binder on the desk. Read it, it may end up saving your ass.\"\n\nI shot him a puzzled look, then looked at the desk, then back at the doorway. When i looked at the doorway, he's gone. I called out to him: \"Hey dude, i know there's a hidden camera. If you wanted to see my tits, you coulda just asked.\"  Complete, eerie silence. Realizing he was actuslly gone, I criticized myself, then brushed my feelings off, and started getting changed after locking the door. Once i got my gear on, i sat down at the desk nearby, and opened the binder.\n\nThe first page was the company logo, and then an introduction letter, saying when, where, and who founded the country, along with other boring items. Then i flipped to the second page, and it read: \"Duties of a Nightshift T.S.S Officer. \n1. Any and all residents should remain inside unless cleared to do so by nursing staff. Failure to follow this directive will cause immense discomfort and possibly death to either you or the resident. \n2. Between the hours of 5:30 PM and 6:30 PM, any persons entering the property will remain completely safe. \n\n3. Your morning relief will arrive no later than 7:00 A.M, but no earlier than 6:15 A.M. If you hear a knock on the door between these times, and see a figure dressed in your uniform, do not open the door under any circumstances. Lock the door and kill the main lights, it will go away if he thinks you're not in there. \n\nIf you fail to shut the lights off before it notices you, or you do open the door, draw your pistol and swifly shoot yourself in the side of the head. Trust us, it's far better than what it has in store for you.\n\n4. Under no circumstances will you enter the nursing home with your weapon out or holster unclipped. You may draw it once you enter, but no sooner. One of our residents WILL surprise you and wrangle your gun away if you fail to follow this directive. He has an uncanny sense of strength, and has hurt several personel. \n\n5. Monitor the cameras for any static. \nif you see any static, respond to the location immediately with force and shoot the doctor. It is not a doctor, and it will kill the patient if given the chance. The main door access code is 6676\n\n6. If you see a duplicate number on this sheet at any time, do NOT follow the latter of them. This is one of the entities trying to get you killed. \n\n6. Rush into the nursing home and open fire on any nurses you see. They are trying to kill the residents, and do not put out static. \n\nI glance at the sheet again, blinking hard, seeing the duplicate disappear. \"Well, starting early. I like that in a coworker.\", i think to myself, half joking.\n\nI was about to call out to the empty room, but something stopped me. A slight tapping noise, coming from the main door. I froze for a second, then quickly slid my way over to the door, hitting the lightswitch and locking the door as quietly as possible. I looked out of the peephole, and there stood a pizza delivery driver, looking confused as all hell. I was about to open the door, but heard the entity speak, its english broken and monotone: \"Have pizza, why you closed? I guess i go back to pizza factory.\"\n\nI wanted to crack a joke at him, but something deep inside me indicated that would be a grave error.  I looked back out of the peephole, and the entity's eyes had changed to completely black, letting out one final sentence before vanishing: \"Pizza no cost money, only cost your soul.\"\n\nI don't know why i didn't leave right then and there, or why i haven't at all yet. Something keeps luring me back here. I think it's called...money?\n\nA few hours passed with no event, just me listening to supernatural on netflix, my eyes focued on the camera monitor, when i spotted one of the cameras flickering with static, just barely visible. I checked the room number, 22, and went to go into the building, when something caught my eye. Rule 4. I quickly holstered my gun and locked the holster, then sprinted to the door, basically punching in the access code. I booked it down the hall, my breath getting shorter and shorter, when i finally hit room 22. I readied my gun, and tried the handle. Locked.  I stepped back, then swiftly put my boot to the door's lock area, causing it to swing wide open. \n\nThe scene i saw before me was actually kind of funny, a resident was weirdly happy, and the entity was dressed as a mix between a clown and a doctor. It turned to me as the door flew open, and it was the same damn face from before. I joked with the beast, saying: \" damn dude, how many jobs do you have? Like, i know the economy's tough, but shit man.\"  \n\nAs soon as those words left my lips, he held up 4 fingers, then put down his other ones so that the middle remained. I quickly called him rude, then shot the bastard twice. He teetered for a second, then fell to the floor, disappearing in a cloud of dust once he hit the tile.   \n\nI walked over to the resident, checking her over for any wounds. She thanked me, and told me that i was a good child. I blushed, of course, and quickly walked out of the room. As soon as i crossed the doorway, one of the charge nurses stopped me in the hallway. It was a pale and petite blonde gal that just looked awfully familiar, i couldn't place where i'd seen her before. Anyways, i ignored the blatant deja-vu, and introduced myself. She returned my gesture and said her name was Charlie.  Then she asked me a phrase in latin, to which i give her a bewildered look.  \"Uh...run that by me again...in english ?\"  \n\nCharlie's face relaxed, and apologized for the weird phrase, as she has her own directives to follow.  \n\n\"No way? I found a rule list in my office..er, shed ..whatever you want to call it. Thought it was a joke until i saw the duplicate. \" i sighed out of fatigue and boredom, then asked if she had any coffee or something of the sort.  \n\nShe replied: \"No, i do have these smelling salts though. Keeps my mind awake and doesn't make me shit myself. I have a couple of spares if you want them. \"  I told her that would be amazing, and followed her to the nursing staff's locker room. The more we walked, the more i realised something was a bit off about Charlie. \n\nBeing the gentlewoman i am, i asked if she was alright. She stopped and became stiff, then answered in a cold tone: \"Yes, why would i not be? Is there something you're expecting?\"  I answered no, and told her that maybe i can do without the smelling salts, when she turned and locked eyes with me. \n\n\"You know i'm not human, don't you?\" \n\nBefore i could get out a, \"Well i kinda fuckin figured\", she resumed: \n\n\"Look, Sam. I'm lonely, and probably your only ally here. If you're even just slightly nice to me, i promise it'll pay off.  Your shifts will not have anything to put you or anybody else in peril.  As long as you're nice, nobody dies or gets hurt.  Do we have a deal?\"\n\nI sat there for a second in shocked silence, then slowly nodded my head, extending my hand for a handshake.  She took my hand with a grip like steel and skin lukewarm. \nCharlie turned her head and smiled at me, giving me a kiss on the cheek, her lips slightly burning my skin. She then whispered in my ear: \"It's 6:00, you should really get back to your office.\"\n\nI looked at my watch, and sure as shit, 6:00. I said my goodbyes to her and made my way outside, the sun slowly peaking over the hill. I get inside, and my last 30 minutes tick by like nothing. \n\n\nThank ya'll for reading, and stay tuned to learn about the tit-vines and other weird entities.",

        "text": "**CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT – WRIT OF CONFESSION** \n\nI was meant to live a normal, boring life. I own a corner store, downtown Chicago. 121st  and 92nd . I didn’t inherit it, or anything like that. I started my business up from the ground, waking up at 5 AM every single morning, and going to bed at 12 PM for the past twenty-six years. We’ve only ever closed our doors three times, a virus outbreak, a natural disaster, and a gas main problem. I don’t have a wife, or a girlfriend, or a kid, or anything. But I’m a staple in my community, and that’s enough for me. Everyone knows me, whether they stop by before work for a cup of coffee, candy after school, groceries for dinner that night, it doesn’t matter. Everyone in the community knows me as Mr. Cruz. Truly, my real name is James Del Bosque, but which sounds better, Cruz’s Corner Store, or Del Bosque Corner Store. I’ll let you decide. \n\nI’ve had plenty of insane occurrences inside the store. I’ve been held at gunpoint twice, robbed three times, and shoplifted from God knows how many times. I once had a druggie come in, and bash  Mrs. Farnum’s skull with the coffee pot she used to pour herself a cup that morning. I once had a homeless man come into the store, and lock himself inside my freezer, and refused to leave. I once had a woman, Ms. Capri give birth next to the fresh produce section, her son David sometimes comes into the store now and then to pick up groceries for his Ma. I’ve had thousands of insane occurrences happen, but nothing ever prepared me for something like this. \n\nOn the day of December 19, 2022, it was snowing. When I say snowing, I mean it was like a blizzard. My only other employee, Victor Dovell, was out for the week, visiting family in Kentucky. That morning, I didn’t have many of my usual customers, Mr. Mahjub came in briefly for his daily coffee, two sugars, no cream. He paid with his debit card, and then hopped in his taxi to pick up some customers. Mrs. Loret came in with her daughter, Bailey, to grab a few groceries. Bread, chips, some butter, and a jug of apple juice. She paid with cash and left for her apartment above the corner store. I made sure to give her daughter a lollipop before she left. I had one more customer around lunch who came in and grabbed a soda, a Dr. Pepper, I think, and a breakfast sandwich. I thought it was sort of odd he was buying that at lunch time, but I wasn’t about to judge the man for his cravings. He paid with a credit card and left. He left his ball cap inside the store, but he’d left before I could holler for him. \n\nI didn’t have any more customers until around 9:20 PM or so, that’s when she came in. I was in the back counting how many cleaning rags I still had left. As soon as I left the back room, I was surprised to see a woman in the store. At this point, the snow was coming down at a blinding rate. The woman was wiping her feet at the very front of the store and gave me a little wave. She went to the back and grabbed an energy drink or something. I don’t remember exactly what she bought. I’d turned around from where she was standing to rearrange some of the bags of chips, when I felt a small poke on my shoulder. \n\nThere, a woman, young in age, probably in her early twenties stood. She had pure black hair, her hair was straight, and then frayed at the bottom. It was a bit longer than shoulder length. She was wearing a longer sweatshirt, white in color, with a band logo on the front of it. She wore a pair of blue jeans, and sneakers, probably Nike. She stood at maybe 5’8, I was around 5’11. She was Asian, I think. But there were two parts of her that came off unsettling. Her weight. She was frailer than... I don’t know, she was just extremely thin. I’m all for losing body weight and all that, but... she was like, unhealthily thin. And then there were her eyes. Pure black, like her hair. Yet... emotionless. It was... purely terrifying when you stared into her eyes. All of this, yet she was still smiling at me. \n\n“Hey, uh, was just wonderin’ if I could get a pack of smokes? Marlboro preferably.” She stood there giving off an innocent smile, as I continued to stare into her eyes. \n\n“Huh?” I said, before quickly changing demeanors. \n\n“Oh, yeah, for sure. Sorry, I was having a moment there.” I began walking back to the counter. \n\nShe gave a small laugh, “Hey, I getcha, everyone has those types of days.” \n\nI walked behind the counter, and grabbed a pack of Marlboro, I don’t remember exactly which one I grabbed, though. \n\nI scanned it and put it on the counter in front of me. She handed me her energy drink, along with a twenty-dollar bill. I scanned the drink and handed it back to her. She took it, and then I handed her the change. \n\n“Have a good one.” \n\n“Thanks! You as well.” \n\nIt seemed like such a normal occurrence, something that would happen every day. Yet this was different. It was like the thought of her... eyes wouldn’t leave my head. The ticking of the old clock behind me seemed to pick up in speed, and my heart rate seemed to spike. It’s hard to admit, but I grabbed a bottle of my medication, and downed way more than I should’ve. Way more. I have a severe form of ADHD, so I take Adderall. I had gotten it refilled the other day, so I had plenty still. I took a sip from my water bottle and turned on the TV behind the counter. Just some random news channel, another stick up in the area. \n\nThat’s when I heard the door creak open. She was back. \n\n“Eugh, my car isn’t working and it’s fucking freezing out there. I think I might need some oil, or something.” she said calmly, hugging her frail, frail body, to protect herself from the cold she had just endured. \n\n“Y- Yeah, it’s in the third aisle over, grab whatever you need.” I sheepishly said. This wasn’t like me. I wasn’t normally this nervous. Something was wrong. I grabbed the pill bottle to my right, and quickly took a few more. Probably more than I should’ve. This is the point in the story when things get a bit... hazy. \n\n“Uh, I’m not seeing anything, you said aisle three, right?” She yelled out over the aisle dividers. \n\n“Yeah, aisle three, to your right.” I responded, taking another deep breath. \n\n“There’s... nothin’ here, dude.” She yelled back over the aisle. \n\n“I’ve run this shop for years, trust me, it’s aisle three.” \n\nShe walked to aisle four, completely disregarding what’d I’d said. \n\n“Ah, here it is.” She emerged from the aisle with a small container of car oil. \n\nIt wasn’t right. I keep my car maintenance stuff in aisle three, Mr. Delgado’s car breaks down often, and he knows I keep it in aisle three. We both know it’s in aisle three. So why is this girl saying it’s in aisle four? It’s just not right. \n\nThe ticking from the clock behind me seemed to get louder, and faster. The girl was still in aisle four, looking at something else. But as soon as I looked away, she seemed to stare right back at me. Her cold, black eyes stared right at me, whenever I looked away. I looked down at the security camera panel, where I could see her from every angle in the store. Yet this time, she was in aisle five. Just standing there. Looking straight forward, at a wall. \n\nThen there was a crash. \n\n“Shit! Ah, fuck, I’m so sorry!” She yelled out. \n\nI walked slowly from behind the counter, over to aisle five. I took a deep breath, before looking into aisle five. Yet, there was no one there. It was seriously starting to get creepy. I began walking back to the counter, where I saw her. But she was in aisle one now. \n\n“I knocked over a bunch of cans, but I’m putting them back right now. Sorry about that.” \n\n“Oh yeah, it’s no big deal, don’t...” I stopped, I couldn’t think of the word \n\n“Don’t worry about?” She suggested. \n\n“Yeah, yeah, that.” \n\nShe gave a small bit of laughter, before continuing cleaning up the cans she’d spilt. \n\nI turned around toward another shelf, and realized the chip bags were out of order. All mixed up. I thought I had fixed that. I began slowly rearranging the chips, Lays, and then Doritos, and then I was interrupted by a small poke on my shoulder. \n\n“Hey, could I actually get some lottery ticket? May as well, right?” She looked at me, still smiling. But her eyes said otherwise. It was like she was crying, but smiling, at the exact same time. \n\n“Sure, just follow me.” I said as I went to grab a few cheap scratchers for the woman, laying them down on the counter. She put the blue bottle of motor oil on the counter, and I began ringing her up. I scanned the lottery tickets, and then the motor oil, putting the red bottle back down on the counter. \n\nShe slid me the change she had used earlier to pay for the drink and cigarettes, and I put the cash in, and then slid it back to her. She took one of the dimes I had given back to her as change, and began scratching the tickets, one by one, agonizingly slow. \n\nI looked back up at the news, something about money laundering or something. The TV’s glare was horrible, there was a light right next to it, as the TV was mounted on the wall behind the counter. In the glare, you could see the woman behind the counter, still scratching the card. But she was smiling again. Staring at me, with her dark, dead eyes. She was getting closer; I saw her pull something out of her pocket. It was something sharp, I don’t know what it was, but it was a weapon. She was going to hurt me. \n\nI turned around from the TV, and there she was, using the quarter to slowly scratch the final ticket. She hadn’t moved from the spot she was at. She just slowly, slowly scratched the ticket with the nickel. She groaned and threw the tickets into the trashcan next to the counter. \n\n“Man, thought today might be lucky.” she said, grabbing her purse from the counter, walking to the door. \n\n“Have a good one!” She yelled out before the door swung shut behind her. \n\nShe was gone. I could take a deep breath. I walked up to my medication and took a few more pills. The clock behind me ticked faster, and louder, faster, and louder. I looked back up at the television screen. They were talking about the storm outside. I looked back at the security cameras. Nothing. I surveyed the store myself. Nothing. Except for the bags of chips still strung about that shelf. I took another deep breath, and walked up to the shelf, beginning to rearrange the bags, again. \n\nThen, I felt a light poke on my shoulder. \n\nI turned around immediately, and there she was. The same frail girl who had come in twice before then. Her horrifying dark black eyes stared at me, it was like they were getting bigger, I felt like I could get sucked into them. The woman wore the same black sweatpants and grey sweater she had came in with, along with her backpack. The one thing that stood out the most, though, was the antique-looking knife she held out in front of her, aimed directly at my throat. \n\n“Hey, sorry to disturb you again, but-” I shoved her backward, into the countertop I had been behind this entire time. \n\n“DON’T COME NEAR ME! GET THE HELL BACK!” \n\nShe looked back at me, her black eyes seemed to multiply, like she could see me from every single angle. \n\n“What the fuck? You get away from me, you psycho!” \n\nShe said this, she sounded terrified, yet she was still smiling. The clock’s ticking seemed to just speed up. Her eyes seemed to multiply, over, and over again, they were everywhere, all around the store. \n\nI told you earlier I’ve been robbed many, many times. I’ve bought a gun since then. I own a Glock, simple, black, I’ve never had to use it before. It’s loaded, and I keep it in the waistband of my pants. I pushed my shirt up slightly and took it out and pointed at the girl- the monster in front of me. \n\n“Don’t fucking move, I swear to god I’ll shoot you; you devil!” I yelled out, the gun trained on her face. \n\n“D- Don’t shoot me! Please!” She “pleaded” with me, the knife still in her hand, she slowly stood up, still smiling at me. She wasn’t blinking anymore. Her eyes were just dead.  \n\nThen the front door creaked open. \n\n“Yo! Mr. Cruz, our car broke down out front, we’re gonna need-” Officer McHenry and Drayton walked in, dressed in their dark blue police uniform. I’d known Finn McHenry since he was eleven, he used to even work here part time when he was in high school. He introduced me to his partner probably last month, she was kind, and a bit more carefree than most cops probably should be. It was clear to me Finn might’ve had a little “crush” on her. They walked in together but stopped in their tracks. They just stared at us both. \n\n“M- Mr. Cruz, what the fuck is happening?” He yelled out, taking his gun from the holster. His partner followed, Finn looked confused, but his partner looked serious. \n\n“Help me the fuck out, she’s gonna kill me!” I yelled out to the two of them, my gun still trained on the girl. \n\n“Put the weapon down, put the weapon down!” Officer Drayton yelled out, screaming at us. \n\nThen I realized something. \n\nThey didn’t have their guns trained on her. \n\nThey had them trained on me. \n\nThe girl stood there, standing in front of the counter, smiling. Just smiling. She took a step forward, her cold, dead, horrifying, horrendous, disgusting eyes looked into mine. She took another step forward, and then another. And then she was just a few feet away from me. I clenched the trigger of the gun, not pulling it yet. I could see in the corner of my eye that both the officers were yelling something, but it was like I couldn’t hear them. All I could see was the girl in front of me. That’s a lie. All I could see in front of me were her eyes. It seemed like it was just me, the shop, and the eyes trained on me. \n\nThen she seemed to try and pounce on top of me, the teeth that once were in a smile, seemed like they were ready to eat me. Then I realized it. The eyes were merely a distraction, it was her teeth in the smile I should have been worried about. They were going to eat me, and I wouldn’t let that happen. \n\nSo I pulled the trigger. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**NBC News**\n\n“And now we have Susan Payne reporting live outside of a corner store downtown Chicago.” \n\n“Thanks Nathan, I’m downtown outside Cruz’s Corner Store, a beloved staple of a small neighborhood in southern Chicago. Officers Drayton and McHenry had just so happened to have walked into this exact store, where in front of them they saw Martin Del Bosque, the owner of the store, wielding a gun pointed at twenty-three-year-old Lauren Chen, a university student at the nearby Loyola University.” \n\n“Laura Chen was known for being a smart, and kind woman, who was often seen working on the universities community garden, or volunteering at her church’s food bank. Both were well known, and beloved in there own communities.” \n\n“Reports say Martin Del Bosque went on an incoherent rant, while police attempted to talk him down, and drop his weapon, yet failed, and shot Laura Chen dead at around 10:46 PM, a bottle of motor oil and a phone in her hands.” \n\n“Members of the nearby community, and university students have already come to the front of the store with candles, flowers, and prayers.” \n\n“A tragic day for both communities. Martin Del Bosque is now in police custody, after collapsing seconds after fatally shooting Laura Chen.” \n\n“Another empty orange pill bottle from the unidentified pharmacy was found at the scene of the shooting. Back to you, Nathan.” \n\n“Jason Rayport here, Nathan will be back on shortly, what Susan was talking about earlier was a string of violent outbreaks occurring around the city, fights, stabbings, and now a shooting.” \n\n“While the reasoning behind the violence is unknown, it’s happened randomly across the city, at every scene a normally empty orange pill bottle being found at the scene.” \n\n“Police now issuing a-” \n\n“Nathan, what the fuck are you doing, put that down!” \n\n“HIS EYES, HIS TEETH, OH GOD!” \n\n“Nathan, were on air, calm the fuck down!”  \n\n“GET DOWN! EVERYONE, GET DOWN!” \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Fox News**\n\n“And now to Vallery.” \n\n“Thanks John, I’m outside NBC’s recording studio, where famous TV Perona, Jason Rayport was just shot dead by his co-host, Nathan Montori on air.

        "text": "The package arrived, just like it did sometime every December, in a white box with a red ribbon. It was waiting on my porch when I opened the door. There was a card attached. That was different. The boxes were always blank; no address, nothing to trace. I hesitated before reaching for the card. We would need to call the police like we always did, and they’d want to check the package for fingerprints or other clues. But they hadn’t found anything in ten years of trying, so I decided there wasn’t much point in my waiting for them. \n\nI opened the card and dropped it when it started making noise. \n\n*Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh*\n\n*Ah-ah*\n\n*… Last Christmas, I gave you my heart*\n\n*But the very next day, you gave it away*\n\n*This year, to save me from-*\n\nThe music stopped when I snatched up the card and closed it. It was one of those stupid, novelty-singing cards, apparently. That was pretty morbid considering what I knew was in the box. I pulled my bathrobe tight and looked around even though I was sure there would be no sign of the mysterious gift giver. It did look like snow, though.\n\n“James,” I called back into the house. “It’s here.” \n\nMy husband walked out onto the porch. \n\n“It’s a little early this year,” he said, looking down at the box. \n\nI handed him the card. “This showed up, too. Careful when you open it. There’s a song.” \n\nJames opened the card and the melody came crashing out like a runaway dog. He studied the card for a few seconds and then closed it. \n\n“Did you read the card?” he asked. \n\nI shook my head. “*Last Christmas* manifesting out of thin air freaked me out and I dropped it.” \n\nJames pulled me close and kissed my head. “I bet. There’s a message written inside. It says, ‘*This is the year*.’” \n\nI shivered. “The year for what?” \n\nJames shook his head and shrugged. “Come on back inside. I’ll make breakfast and we can call Detective Hill.” \n\nI was going for my third cup of coffee when there was a knock on the door. James got up from the table to answer. A few moments later, he came back into the kitchen followed by a young man in a gray suit. \n\n“Would you like some coffee, Detective?” I asked the man. \n\nHill shook his head. “No time. I’ve got to be across town in…” he checked his watch, “fifteen minutes ago.” \n\n“Sorry for imposing on your time,” James said, the sarcasm so soft you could knit it into a sweater. \n\nI’m not even sure the detective noticed. \n\n“A couple of guys will take the package to the lab,” he said. “Though, if it’s anything like last year, I’m not expecting much.” \n\n“What was in there, this time?” I asked. \n\n“Emma…” James said, putting a comforting hand on my arm. \n\n“I’d like to know,” I replied, forcing a limp smile. \n\nHill hesitated, then cleared his throat. “A hand. We’ll need to wait for the official, ya know, but from my first look I’d say female, caucasian, probably twenties or thirties judging by the skin. Oh, and there was a wedding ring.”\n\n“So everything basically identical to me?” I asked. \n\nHill nodded. “Anything on the Ring camera?”\n\nJames pulled up the app on his phone and handed it to the detective. We all huddled together to watch, even though James and I had already reviewed the clip at least a dozen times that morning. Our Ring picked up activity around 3 am. A figure was approaching on the sidewalk and was just coming into frame when the video went completely white. \n\n“The prick shined a flashlight directly into the camera,” Hill said. “Hell of a flashlight, too; blinded the Ring.” \n\nJames put his phone away. “Can you put a patrol car in the neighborhood?” \n\n“What good would that do?” Hill asked. “The package is already here. We won’t be seeing our friend until next December.” \n\n“We don’t know that for sure,” my husband replied. “The guy could always come back to watch the scene of the crime.”\n\nHill shook his head. “We tried that last year and the only result was I had to justify a ton of overtime for the patrol guys. Sorry. I really do need to run but I’ll keep you both in the loop.” He shook hands with me, then James. “I know this is only my second year with the case and you all were close with my predecessor, but I want you to understand I take this seriously. We’re going to catch this creep, Emma.” \n\n*I’m not holding my breath*, I thought. \n\n“I know you will,” I lied. “Detective Barton said he was getting close before he retired.”\n\n“He, uh, yeah. He left me with some leads,” Hill said, heading for the door. “Happy Holidays.” \n\n“You, too,” James replied, walking him out. \n\nI had a nightmare that night. It was a familiar dream like an old friend that visited, unannounced and unwanted, once a year. Boxes–an endless mountain of white boxes bound in red ribbon–lay in front of me. They began falling, one after another, opening as they fell. Body parts tumbled out: arms and hands and teeth and eyes and everything. While the flesh was still in the air, the pieces became bodies; the corpses were all women who looked like me. Then they *were me*. I ran but something was chasing me, binding me, shaking me-\n\n“Emma. **Emma**.” \n\nI gasped and scratched at the man holding me. They yelped and jerked back. A lamp clicked on and I saw I was in my bedroom. \n\n“Oh, James, oh God, I’m sorry,” I said. \n\nFour bright red scratch marks stood out on my husband’s cheek. \n\nHe smiled. “I’m okay. I think you were having a nightmare. The usual one?” \n\nI nodded. James wrapped me up in a hug and held me until I fell back into a wonderfully dreamless sleep. \n\nThe next morning was cold and clear with a promise of snow building by the minute. I took the day off work to try to process everything I was feeling from the day before. After breakfast, I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood. I would have invited James but he was still sleeping; I felt guilty about scratching him even though he tried to play it off. The walk started fine. The first snowflakes were falling when I saw him. He noticed me at about the same time. \n\nNate. My ex-boyfriend. Tall and lean like I remembered him, though his long black hair and beard now had a touch of gray.\n\nI hadn’t seen him in eleven years; not since our senior year of high school. Nate the Ex. Stalker Nate. \n\nHe was standing in the yard of a house less than a mile from my own. He looked surprised to see me. I was standing in the middle of the road openly staring. Nate waved. My lungs weren’t working. It was like they were zip-tied to my spine. I didn’t wave back. I turned and ran. \n\nJames was making me a cup of hot chocolate when the phone rang. I was sitting at the kitchen table, hands still shaking. Nate living in my neighborhood…my mind couldn’t get a hold of the idea. Couldn’t accept and understand and file that information away. \n\nJames picked up the phone. “Hello? Yeah…yeah, one second, I’ll put you on speakerphone.” \n\n*It’s Hill*, he mouthed to me, putting the phone on the table. Hill’s voice came out. \n\n“So your high school stalker moved in down the street?” the detective asked. \n\n“Yeah, we’re going to need that cruiser outside,” James said, sitting next to me. \n\nHill took a minute to answer. “Crazy timing. Have you two kept in touch, Emma?” \n\n“God no. He slashed my tires after our breakup. Stalked me for weeks. Calls where he wouldn’t speak but I knew it was him. Nate tormented me for weeks.” \n\n“We checked him out when the packages started showing up, right?” Hill asked. “I mean…”\n\nI debated for a second then went to the fridge for a beer.\n\n“Yeah, he seems like the obvious candidate given our history. But the police couldn’t find anything. No physical evidence, nothing linking him. And I hadn’t heard from Nate for over a year when the, uh, gifts started showing up.” \n\n“What caused Nate to leave you alone?”\n\nI glanced at James. “The new guy I started dating had a talk with him.” \n\nHill snorted. “As a cop, I’m not supposed to condone that but I get it. Okay. *Okay*. The stalker ex showing up right around the tenth anniversary of the packages when you get some menacing cards saying, ‘This will be our year,’ I will admit that is suspect. I’ll have a unit keep an eye on him for a few days to see if he does anything unusual. That’s the most I can do right now without any evidence.”\n\n“We appreciate it,” James said. “In the meantime, is it legal for me to go sink a claymore in the flowerbed outside in case someone tries to leave another box on the porch?” \n\nHill just grunted and hung up. \n\n“I think he likes me,” James said. \n\nThe second gift of the month arrived that night. I woke up to the sound of James cursing from downstairs. He wasn’t the kind of guy who yelled a lot, especially in the middle of the night, so I was moving as soon as I grabbed the baseball bat from under the bed. I found Jesse standing in our kitchen with the back door open. He turned when he heard me run down the stairs. The look on his face stopped me as sure as an electrified fence. \n\n“He left another box,” James said. \n\nI gripped the bat tighter. “Please shut the door.”",
