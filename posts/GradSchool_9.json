However, it is not my first choice and I do not know if I will be able to make it 5 years in that town as the location is very isolating and far from family. On the flip side, the professors are at the top in their fields.\n\nI would like to join the PhD program and then switch to a MS (with thesis) to get research experience and improve my profile for the next application cycle. Do you think this would cause any issues with the graduate school (burning bridges and such) ? \n\nJust to reiterate, I do not want to go 2 years on the PhD track and then master out, I want to make the switch to a MS as soon as I join (first or second week). Is this something that students do?  Thanks for the advice.",

It's been a hell of an experience in really showing me what grad school and academia can be like. Anyway I figured you guys would be best to ask!\n\nMy supervisor and I set deadlines through the last 2 semesters for me to meet, things like having literature review done, my proposal, etc. My next deadline is having my data analysis done this upcoming Friday (March 3rd) when we are supposed to meet next.\n\nIt's currently Sunday and I am already afraid I won't meet the deadline. I vastly underestimated how long everything from data cleaning to coding would take (R Studio) as this is my first time working with real data not in a controlled classroom environment. I have two midterms this Tuesday and Wednesday which are going to take away at least 2-3 days from my thesis work, and I'm afraid I still need at least a few more days to work on this.\n\nDoes it reflect poorly if I email her tomorrow (Monday) and ask for an extension to at least the following week? Is it normal for people to do this? I'm starting to feel guilty and like a slacker for not getting further on this than I am, and taking as long as I am. This thesis has kicked my ass more than anything else in my degree and completely caught me by surprise just how much work and labour is required in research. In many ways though, I'm happy for the reality check and experience from this!",

        "text": "I am looking to apply to some online MS programs for applied math. My top choice would be Johns Hopkins applied and computation mathematics online MS. This program is advertised as a \"part-time, online, engineering for professionals\" program.\n\n* The classes offered are relevant to a certain sector of the aerospace industry I am interested in.\n* Out of all the options, this would also be one of the best options to support a reasonable work-life balance with a part-time options\n* My employer benefits fully cover it; I only have to cover the taxes since the \"free\" tuition is treated as additional income. (Roughly 60k per year in income worth of taxes)\n* Addition to my previous point, unlike my other choices, my employer has a special deal w/ JHU where tuition is 10% off, so I'll actually have to pay the taxes for about 54k worth of additional annual income.\n\nI've highlighted my above reasons as to why JHU is my top choice. However, after looking around, I've heard that a lot of online grad programs are \"cash cow\" programs; they will admit nearly anyone in order to generate easy tuition revenue. My main concern as I've read a few times, is that these students in these programs may not get as much attention and resources as traditional students. A few comments here suggested that JHU's AAP program may be one of these programs. Wanted to know if the JHU's applied math online program is similar in this way too. If so, I may consider a different first choice.\n\nGraduates from these alleged \"cash cow\" online programs, how were your experiences? Were they much less selective? Did you get treated just as well as on-site students? Anyone with experience with the applied and computational math online program at JHU, can you give an insight on this?\n\nWhen JHU advertises this program as \"part-time, online, engineering for professionals program\", is this a red flag to look out for? Curious b/c there's not too much discussion online on this specific JHU program.",

        "text": "First time posting here but I (23 f) start attending grad school only in autumn. It is a program that lasts for 2 years however, I may have rushed into enrolling myself in one. Honestly, I received a lot of pressure from family members, friends, etc. It was almost expected of me to eventually do this so...I did. I found a program that seemed useful for the future and enrolled myself in it. The problem came when I realized that I did not like it at all. At first, I tried to ignore it by telling myself that I was just still burned out after graduating college and getting my BC degree, but then I realized that this feeling of misery was just a growing story. I did not enjoy any of the subjects, one of our teachers was bullying us for anything and when the exam sessions came, I was dreading studying and not in the way that all students do, but rather, I was simply not willing to work hard for it, because I couldn't help but feeling like I didn't want to be there and that I was making a mistake. Once again, I decided to keep going however I reached my wits' end last week when I realized that I no longer wanted to dedicate myself to this program and that this program is just not doing me any good. Frankly speaking, it didn't help that our teachers straight up told us that this degree would not be enough to work in the required field and that someone without a degree but official national testing, would be able to secure a job a lot easier than we would (for those who wonder, it's about translation/ and the job of a translator) so.. putting all of this together, I decided to quit and pursue something else. I decided to go towards a career path that fits me much better and if I somehow wanted to further my education, to do it when I find a program that I have an actual interest in honestly..it felt like I was doing the right thing, the pressure was suddenly off, I was feeling good for the first time in months and I was secure with this decision until a few days ago when guilt kicked in and..well the thought of my parents being disappointed in me..so I would like to ask. Am I doing the wrong thing? People who went through a similar change of mind, what did you do? Thank you for reading all of that and excuse my mistakes, English is not my first language.",

It’s a 2 year course and I’m in the 2nd year.\n\nMy deadlines are causing me anxiety, especially dissertation which is due on 29th September. The grade I get for dissertation will be counted as a double module, so there’s a lot of pressure. I get anxiety at night thinking about work and uni deadlines, and all the stuff I have to do the next day. \n\nMy uni have made this document with the ideal dissertation timeline, and it says we should get our literature review done by the end of February. It’s now the 25th and I’ve only done 900 words and I’m starting to panic.  I was even thinking about taking unpaid leave from work to try and finish my lit review. Annoyingly I have no leave left because I’ve had to use it for a uni field trip.\n\nI’m on track to finish the course- in the 8 assignments I’ve done I’ve got 2 distinctions (highest grade) 6 merits (middle grade) and 1 pass (lowest grade) But I’m not amazingly good at academic writing. In my undergraduate dissertation I didn’t do that well. I got 55% so a 2:2 grade, luckily somehow I still got a 2:1 overall for my degree. The pass mark for Master’s courses in England where I live is 50%. So I’m worried that I might not pass. Also I want to do primary research for my dissertation which is going to be very time consuming. Admittedly my undergrad dissertation was very rushed. I did the whole thing in 2 months including primary research. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for how to keep anxiety at bay? Yoga and meditation help me, but I have to be soo consistent with them. This morning I didn’t meditate and I think that might be why I feel anxious now.",

(note: I graduated with a 3.4 gpa)\n\nI feel like the last year was crucial to show my capabilities, network, and make sure my faculty mentor knew my academic and career goals. But that did not happen.\n\nAfter a year off, I now feel prepared to apply for Ph.D. programs but feel embarrassed about my academic performance and lack of active participation outside of completing assignments. I don't know that my professors would want to write me LOR's. I feel a bit lost and disappointed that I didn't just take a break during my MA until I was well enough to finish strong.\n\nAny insight on how I can go about applying? Am I possibly overthinking things? I also have zero research--my program focused more heavily on writing, grammar, and editing for digital media versus literature, critical theory, or rhetoric which I realized once in my program I wanted to focus on for my PhD.\n\nSomeone recommended that I consider doing a second Master's that is more focused on what I want my PhD to be in to be more competitive (obviously would still need LORs). I could then potentially try to transfer in with that MA, so I don't have to repeat MA-level coursework in a PhD. but I wonder if that's overkill or making things more complicated. \n\nThanks for any insight, I appreciate it!",

But I took responsibility for those mistakes and I’m trying to do the best that I can now (especially since the start of the year) despite some circumstances beyond my control slowing me down significantly. I’m all about taking personal responsibility. But apparently they don’t see it that way. Especially my mom. \n\nApparently she seems to think that all I do is waste time and goof off all day. Which is completely untrue. Sometimes I do need to walk away from my work from time to time because of how overwhelming it can be. But I don’t think she or my dad realizes just how difficult the past three years have been for me. I think that it mostly stems from the fact that they have never gone through this themselves. \n\nEven if I was to try and explain to them how hard it is and has been, mom would brush me off and say that she and my Dad have way worse lives than I do and that if I spent as much time working as I did complaining I would be done by now. Or that if I would just finish my project then I wouldn’t have to worry about it anymore, as if it is that easy. \n\nShe’s not exactly the most empathetic person in the world.

Someone even joked that the only reason I would be so uptight about it is if something \"illegal\" was on there.\n\nAssuming they're like 90% of the population my age, they probably spend time on some websites that are not professional/are adult, and some of that is saved to their computer, either in files or just accessible in internet history. Am I really that out of the box for being extra careful here? Personally I started doing this when I was an undergraduate because of several high profile cases of a professor accidentally sending out a link to an adult website in an email via copy/paste function-- it just seems like common sense.

I am a teacher currently working on my master's degree in a related field (online, asynchronous, 1 8 week course at a time). I am nearly done with my two-year program, and I was told by my advisor that I could complete my last seven credits over the summer, which is ideal since I won't be working at that time, but only if my grades were good as students typically only take 3 credits at a time. I made myself sick busting my butt to get straight As so I could secure this option.\n\nI took my previous classes in a somewhat unconventional order for work-related reasons. There are several other students in the same boat who were all also told they could complete their degrees over the summer, but we are just now being told that we actually can't complete our degrees this summer, not because the classes aren't being offered, but basically because we're not supposed to take the 7 remaining credits all at once. They are not prerequisites. It's more of a procedural/bureaucratic issue.\n\nI want to advocate for myself and put pressure on the university to let me finish those classes this summer. Not taking those classes will cost me money in delayed pay raises, and working full time while going to school and raising an infant has been detrimental to my physical and mental health. I don't want to be still taking courses in the fall when the new school year starts. Is this an issue I should take to the dean? Someone else? Who is my point person here?

But if I am expected to avoid the major hubs of student socializing, I'm worried I'll be similarly isolated to how I am now.

My advisor knows I've been struggling this semester but I havent gotten anything other than data collection done. I cannot bring myself to do any writing or reading or any kind of work. Im burntout and alternate between extreme depression and horrific anxiety. I know if I try and continue with trying to do my paper in addition to work and externals factors it'll just lead to frustration and disappointment for myself and my advisor. I already see myself acting in ways that are self destructive and i know i need to talk with my doctor about my medication and (likely) get back into therapy. That said, how stupid will it seem if I do withdraw for the semester? I think I need time where my paper isn't an added weight to my current stressors (which I do believe I also fixate on instead of doing the work I need to do) but I don't know how badly this could reflect on me.\n\nIt wouldn't be forever, I just need until the summer or fall semester to return to this work.\n\nI don't want to fish for validation- how bad of a decision could this be? I'm afraid the few people I've told are coddling me by telling me it's okay if i need to do this.",

My supervisor is a full professor who I have been working with as an RA for two years. She is nice and very supportive of my academic study.  I am always proud of having a chance to work with her. If there is anyone asking, I am not reluctant to say I work for her\n\nHowever, all of my good images of my supervisor collapsed when I heard several bad stories this afternoon. I had a talk with a professional staff who is an experienced tutor and used to work as TA for my supervisor. It turns out that my supervisor doesn't care about the well-being of her TA. She stuck to the deadline even when the TA was sick, had a meeting at midnight, and sent a bunch of urging emails.  All of three the tutors left her after a year. She used to make a student wait for hours since she forget about the meeting. There also has been a student under her supervisor filing a formal complaint. Honestly, I literally mentally collapsed when hearing that. It's totally opposite to what I saw about her. She is my role model, but it breaks down after those stories. I used to talk with her PhD students but I haven't heard anything like that (or they didn't tell me).\n\nI'm not sure how I feel right now. I learned a lot from her and actually going to have a paper as one of her co-authors (for the context, it very hard to have a paper published as an undergraduate in my field, so it's such an honor). But the stories came too suddenly. Is there anyone have the same experience? How do you deal with it?",
