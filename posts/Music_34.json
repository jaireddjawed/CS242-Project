        "text": "Although the first stage of Miley Cyrus’ career was carefully mapped out for her by Disney executives, she’s been hell-bent on being whoever she wants to be since separating from the Hannah Montana brand. The singer has affected a new striking skin with each album cycle, a process that’s helped keep her at the top of the pop world even when her music has lacked quality. 2013’s *Bangerz* was filled with gaudy neon lights and unmelodious hooks, *Younger Now* was a mild foray into country, and *Plastic Hearts* was Cyrus’ uneven love letter to the rock music that [shaped her](https://loudwire.com/miley-cyrus-freedom-rock-music-all-genres-spotify-rock-this/). \n\nOn her eighth studio album, *Endless Summer Vacation*, the thirty-year-old covers vintage dance-pop. She dials down the controversial antics to make the music the centre of attention, but it’s all so square and predictable. Pedestrian synth-laden beats hold back Cyrus’ quest to rediscover love and redefine herself. It’s pop music without the pop. Never has there been less of an incentive to tune into whatever Cyrus is doing.  \n\nThe singer has made worse-sounding albums, but *Endless Summer Vacation* is Cyrus' first release that is bland. It is cookie-cutter pop without pizzaz. You can even track down the geneses of so many of the album’s facets: The chintzy tropical accents on *Island* mimic a sound that’s recently brought Harry Styles stupefying levels of success, *River* is a clunky facsimile of Lady Gaga’s signature mechanical frenzy. Cyrus doesn’t even bother hiding that her overwrought chanting on *Muddy Feet* is inspired by pop’s most inordinate voice Sia, and just tacks her onto the back end of the song. \n\nAround a dozen names are given production credits, the list reads like a who’s who of pop purists yet no one injects their personality into the soundscape. The beats are consistently summery and run together smoothly; the pleasant plodding bassline of *Rose Coloured Lenses* leads into *Thousand Miles*, a country-pop ballad, without complication, but that plateau is precisely the problem. The unit creates an undisruptive, placid experience but the album would benefit greatly from having its layers defined more clearly to break up some of the gooeyness. When Maxx Morando finally takes the initiative to venture outside of the box on *Handstand*, its distortion is immediately ear-catching. \n\nAhead of the album’s release, Cyrus said that she had separated it into two parts, “The ‘AM’... where there’s a buzz and an energy and a potential of new possibilities,” as well as a ‘PM’ that embodied “slinky, seediness and kind of a grime but a glamour at the same time.” It’s an engaging theme that is limited by the lack of contrast in the production. The record’s second half does, in fact, house the more mellow moments (*Wonder Woman* and *Flowers (Demo)*). If you’re feeling extremely generous, you might describe them as slinky and glamourous, if you aren’t the words lethargic and dull will come to mind.  \n\nCyrus’ wonderful raspy tone, her greatest asset, is severely underutilised here. It’s only during a rip-roaring chorus on *Jaded* and a prickly, jubilant performance on *You* that Cyrus deploys it freely, flexing her vocal prowess. Elsewhere, she opts to colour inside the lines instead, further neutering notes of energy across the album. Cyrus spends the opening minute and a half of *Handstand* whispering with an unsettling metallic twang. As her voice briefly fades away, giving space for the acrobatic synths to blare, it feels like she might erupt on re-entry but she just goes back to the hushed delivery. She builds up so much tension yet there’s no real pay-off. \n\nThere are many parallels between the lyrical content of *Endless Summer Vacation* and *Plastic Hearts*. On both, Cyrus seems to be reframing her thoughts on romance, scrubbing away her wide-eyed naivety and replacing it with mature insight. There are lines like “I'm sorry that you're jaded/I could've taken you places/You're lonely now and I hate it,” from *Jaded* and “Don't wait for me/'Cause forever may never come,” from *Wildcard* that are expertly sculpted after Cyrus’ experience with a rocky marriage and divorce from Liam Hemsworth. It’s a sign that even though a fixed musical identity still evades her, Cyrus is growing more comfortable with herself. \n\nAs is, *Endless Summer Vacation* is the lackadaisical affair its title suggests it might be. There's a silver lining to all the stability, though: Cyrus' most turbulent, exhausting instincts are muted. There’s evidence that Cyrus is evolving, albeit slowly, and not just shapeshifting. While this album is too safe to strike a chord, should Cyrus continue to prioritise her tunes over promotional gimmicks, her next one may well be the sizzling, pleasure-filled experience she intended to make here.  \n\n*Endless Summer Vacation* \\- Miley Cyrus - 4/10",
