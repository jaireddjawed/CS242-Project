Something on the menu (that hopefully has protein and isn't garbage) that has a decent amount of calories for a decent price. Right now, I like the Beefy Melt Burrito at Taco Bell for $2.69 plus tax ($2.93 for me). 610 calories. \n\nSure, from a Frugal standpoint, it's still a huge rip-off, but hey, once in awhile, you have to allow yourself to skip cooking and give into the temptation for a guilty pleasure. If you can get something halfway decent for under $3, that's not too horrible",

        "text": "[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10th4kk/no_spend_feb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFebruary is over and I‚Äôm here to report how I did with my no-spend February. \n\nIn short - I could do better. \n\n* GOAL: Nothing extra at the grocery store. \n    * I have a $600 grocery budget (family of 4) and I know that is often excessive, especially because we have a deep freezer with food that needs eating. I ended the month having spent $444 for the month. I did pretty bad last night and bought a bunch of cookies/snacks‚Ä¶ but the good news was it was Aldi and they were not name brand snacks. \n\n* GOAL: No impulse buys from Costco. \n    * Almost a success. I caved last week and bought a single bag of Godiva dark chocolate hearts,  marked down after V-Day. I did well otherwise.\n\n* GOAL: Nothing ordered from Amazon, Target, etc. \n    * ALOMST a success. In January I bought curtains for the living room, and upon hanging them, realized I really did need a second set, so I caved and ordered them. (They went on sale days later, so I re-ordered both sets and will be returning the original order to save, I think $24.) \n\n* GOAL: No restaurant/fast food AT ALL.\n    * FAIL. But we did not spend much as most months. I had to work in office twice this month, and normally I pack a lunch, but I treated myself. I had a BOGO Bowl from Panda Express and ended up paying less than $4 for one meal, then I had a $4 off a plate at Panda Express, so the second meal was about $5. So, $9 on fast food isn‚Äôt awful, but it wasn‚Äôt my goal. My husband also took our oldest to Chipotle once as a reward for doing better in school. \n\n* GOAL: Try to convince husband to reduce the lunches he buys at work.\n    * SUCCESS! He was NOT happy when I mentioned this idea, but I was very proud of him. He spent $34 vs $69 in Jan, $104 in Dec, $119 in Nov, etc. If he can keep this up, it‚Äôll be great for our finances!\n\nObstacles I anticipated/results:\n* The furnace: Ended up having to pay $75 for a furnace tune up. I‚Äôm thinking we need a new furnace guy, because that seems steep. But what do I know‚Ä¶ \n\n* The Spring Break 2024 Vacation + Replacement Windows &amp; Doors: We went ahead with all of it. We made down payments for our 2024 Spring break vacation (due in full by December) and chose the less expensive option we‚Äôd been looking at. OH. There was also a deal with my credit card and I got $35 off when I spent $100 on that CC toward the downpayment. (Total payment $265.) \n* We also made down payments to two companies to replace windows (company 1) and our entry doors (company 2). Combined, that was almost $1,700. We will be paying the windows up front in cash in June from savings, the doors we financed at 0% financing for 18 months, meaning big payments starting in June because doors are friggen‚Äô expensive and we‚Äôre replacing 3. But we can make it work. \nOverall (when I deduct the vacation &amp; windows/doors because we planed to dip into savings for those) we didn‚Äôt do awful, ending with a surplus of $957 for the month. \n\nThings I learned: \n* I can keep the grocery budget lower if I try hard enough and don‚Äôt shop hungry (yeah, that happened one week too‚Ä¶) Meal planning is of course great, but I‚Äôm pretty bad about that and really need to do better. We typically have veggie loaded nachos once a week as well as a pasta dish another night. \n\n* Hubs is capable of spending less on lunches by bringing his own! (Okay, I knew this because he used to do it. But he fell into bad habits‚Ä¶ Hopefully he‚Äôs into better habits. I will also go back to NOT buying lunch at work 99% of the time.) \n\n* I don‚Äôt need to order everything that pops up on sale from my Amazon wishlists. There‚Äôs almost never a reason that I need something that quickly. I shall continue to watch for GOOD sales to pop up on those items I‚Äôm watching, and debate at that time how badly I need/want it. (I‚Äôm honestly not awful about this to begin with. I‚Äôm already frugal, I just want to be more!)\n\n* Now that I have curtains for my living room I should NOT need to make this purchase again! üòâ And I really should‚Äôve waited for a sale in the first place, Target always has a home sale to take advantage of at some point. I was afraid these curtains would be unavailable though. \n\n* Now that we have to make the payments on the windows/doors and vacation, we need to continue to keep costs down and probably re-evaluate the extra money we‚Äôre currently throwing at the mortgage principle right now. \n\n* Thank goodness we‚Äôre actually getting a tax refund this year, so we can throw that at these new payments. :)",

        "text": "I came to a couple of realizations lately and am trying to fit them together:\n\n* I want to spend less money. Like, a lot less. While I earn 2000 dollars US/monthly divided into biweekly payments - which is enough to pay the rent - I'm concerned that I don't see the numbers go up on my checking account, usually sticking around an \"average\". \n* I really don't like staying in, like, *at all.* My home is a place to eat, sleep, and work and I tend to crave getting out on my feet in the evening and on weekends. A large part of this is because this puts me in a situation where I'm around other people. \n* I use a gym (\\~ 50 US dollars/monthly membership) for exercise in the Spring and Fall and a public park pool (\\~30 US dollars/seasonal) in the Summer, which gets me out of the house and keeps me moving around\n* Not liking to stay in carries over to spending a lot of time in cafes/coffee shops in the daytime on weekends and days off. This obviously means money being spent. However, the main two coffee shops I go to have a strong sense of community attached (e.g. everyone in the neighborhood knows the owner and staff on a first name basis), which is a large part of the reason I go there. \n* One thing I'm aware I can do less frequently is going to bars/clubs - I've figured out one strategy is to treat these mainly as events spaces for the sporadic events (performances etc.) that I'm interested in, even if I might miss socializing with the other regular customers more often. \n* My main \"free\" events are Open Mic nights, group tabletop gaming, and Sip'N'Paint/Drink'n'Draw type events. I'm glad these are free of charge but since they are usually hosted at local businesses I sometimes feel compelled to spend money there to support the business with more than just my presence. \n* The public library is always a free option and while I enjoy browsing books, DVDs, etc. I usually go pretty stir-crazy there pretty quickly due to the quiet and lack of socialization. \n\nMy one issue with places like the gym (not free but gives a place to go) and the public library is that they don't really feel like they encompass a scene or a community that I belong to. \n\nWhat do other people here do when they really want to go places and meet people but don't care to spend a bunch of money? When I look at my social life it feels like it often depends heavily on transactional settings where paying money is expected.",

Unfortunately, after the second month, these were left untouched. Yes, $11.99/month sounds so much worse than $6.99/month, but if you don‚Äôt follow through after the first month, you just spent ~$84 instead of $11.99. Even if you forget to cancel it, you pay $24 instead of $84. \n\nMy own overconfidence cost me &gt;$300, so I figured I‚Äôd share in hopes that despite all our best intentions, sometimes a monthly approach is better.",

Using this card also gets you a nice discount on each gallon of gas, often 20-30 cents per gallon.\n\nI have the GetGo card linked to my PT job bank account and always ensure there's enough in the account to accommodate a few fill-ups.  And my higher, primary income account never gets touched for gas.\n\nI've been doing this for a few months and have experienced no issues to date so thought I'd share.  It's very easy to set up once you have the Advantage card.  I was already using the little keyring reward thing so it didn't take much to transition to the larger, regular card size item.\n\nWhat they didn't tell me at my first transaction, though, is that you have to scan the card for the rewards and then you swipe it through the CC machine to pay.  The first time I used it, they only scanned it and there was a messup on their end.  (I ended up with free snacks because of the confusion so it was a total win for me.  lol)",

So, at the end of the day, I only put the T-shirt in the laundry basket and the sweater goes back in the closet. And at the end of the week I only end up with a few dirty T-shirts which are much easier to wash than sweaters, who also tend to get damaged from over washing. I should add that I rarely wash my jeans in winter. When it rains, I just use a wet rag to scrub the mud spots from the legs.\n\nI've only tried this this winter because I mostly got sick of doing so much laundry each week but it's also a frugal approach I think. I do wash the entire clothing when it needs it but I don't have the whole \"I wore it once so it's dirty and needs washing\" mentality anymore.\n\nSo how about it? Good idea or am I just gross?",

I've already bought a waterproof mattress encasement for it, and seeing the pics of the bed, I could not see a single stain on it. The seller said she had to sell it cause they're making a long-distance move, and the mattress is two years old. \n\nI will be looking for bed bugs on it, but I'm wondering what other advice reddit could provide in terms of disinfecting it before I throw it in the mattress encasement.",

        "text": "Games are not necessary to buy, but there's lots of frugal ways to save money to buy games and get many hours of entertainment.\n\nFirst, always check the latest humble bundle. Recently the bundles have not been as good but you can get 2-3 good games for cheap. If I can play 2 hours of gameplay or more per dollar I consider that a win. There are monthly bundles and random game bundles throughout the month. There are other sites for bundle but they are usually lower quality games and aren't worth it in my opinion.\n\nSecond, I always compare prices on gg.deals, it lists tons of places to buy a game I might be looking at. It has it separated by official and grey market key sites and shows price history as well as lowest recorded prices so you can buy games at the cheapest price possible. Personally I am okay with buying from the grey market sites but you can still find good deals with the official stores listed.\n\nThird, utilize family sharing. You and a friend can go half in on a middle man steam account and just take turns accessing games so you can subsidize the price. Many games like Elden Ring or new releases/early access games are hard to find on key sites (only use official stores for big games like this) and the only real way to buy them is on steam at full price. Also check on steamdb if the game supports family sharing, Typically games with 3rd party launchers do not support it.\n\nFourth, gamepass. While I prefer to \"own my games\" on steam, gamepass can be a great way to play new releases or many games for cheap. Continue to make new Microsoft accounts or use the same link for the 1$ trials. I was able to use 1$ trials over and over again for almost a year. I used this to play atomic heart, since 60$ is a huge ask for a linear fps campaign.\n\nFifth, steam trading subreddits like indiegameswap. They have many rules but you an buy/trade games there and I have been able to gets lots of great games for cheap. Just read the rules and always do your due diligence since it is p2p trading/buying/selling.\n\nSixth, patience and research. Most games will drop heavily in price if you are patient. Plus, if you research the game you can get an estimate how much entertainment you can get from it as well. Many games will rotate into humble bundle after a year or two, or will start getting heavily discounted on keysites. For example most of the resident evil games can be bought under 10$ each now. I waited over a year for deathloop to appear in humble bundle, and not only has it had many patches since release, I got way better value for my patience. You generally do not need to buy games on day one.\n\nThere are obviously multiple less ethical options but this guide is focused on buying / accessing games in a legal way. üëç",

        "text": "My buddy told me about this deal currently going on (that I verified) that will save you a ton of money if you already plan on buying Zelda: TOTK on the Nintendo eShop for full price like I was. \n\nThere‚Äôs 2 parts to this deal: 1.) The Nintendo eShop currently has a deal where you pay $100 and get 2 game vouchers that can be used for any game within 12 months, including TOTK. That‚Äôs already a great deal in itself, but if you have a Costco membership or know someone with one, then‚Ä¶2.) Costco currently has a deal online where you can purchase a $50 Nintendo eShop gift card for $40 after savings (limit 2 gift cards).\n\nSo basically, if you have access to a Costco membership, you can get $100 worth of gift cards for $80 and use that $100 to buy the 2 game voucher deal. Essentially that‚Äôs like buying TOTK full price and getting any other game you want for $10!\n\n\nEDIT: Warning, do NOT try to buy more than 2. There is a strict disclaimer that 2 is the limit and orders are subject to cancellation (I believe only if you violate the terms). My buddy told me that he stupidly tried to buy a 3rd one to see if it would work, which they originally approved, then cancelled his order for all 3 cards. At the moment he is unable to repurchase them, but he‚Äôs going to try again later.\n\nSo fair warning, only buy 2!",

I think I‚Äôve gotten all of them but I‚Äôm sure there is at least one that I‚Äôm not thinking of.\n\n‚Ä¢I am going to ask for more hours at work, although I don‚Äôt make anywhere near the amount he made at his former job.\n\n‚Ä¢He is obviously going to start job hunting immediately. They say it is a labor market right now so I can only hope and pray that he finds something with a comparable salary to his last job.\n\n‚Ä¢We have some furniture and gym equipment from the move that we are going to sell. We‚Äôve been meaning to do that but we were just lazy about it.\n\n‚Ä¢He can empty out his 401k but it would come with a steep penalty and we don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs necessary yet.\n\nI‚Äôm currently wracking my brain trying to think of ways for us to save money so we don‚Äôt lose this house we just bought. We are generally frugal people as it is but we do spend on little luxuries (going out to eat, some impulse purchases etc). Yes, he could get a job right away but that‚Äôs not guaranteed so I‚Äôm trying to plan, plan, plan.\n\nThe location is Detroit, Michigan if that helps.",
