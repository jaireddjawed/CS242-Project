And by fixating on marriage as a balm for your gaping wounds, you can painfully wrong another. \n\nFolks must work on self-development without waiting for marriage to miraculously fix them. Go to therapy, get your health together, enroll in a rehab program now. \n\nOn a spiritual level, if you aren’t waking up for fajr now but gush about how you can’t wait for Mr or Mrs Perfect Muslim to gently sprinkle water on your face for qiyam... keep a cup of water next to you in bed so that you can drench yourself and WAKE UP. How can you rely on the appearance of a person who doesn’t yet exist in your life in this role to take responsibility for your worship? YOU wake you up! YOU be the worshipper you wish you could be! \n\nMarriage can be a great tool of self-improvement and can help us change for the best, with God's will. A blissful marriage is a great blessing from God and the creation and care of a family is a great act of worship. The right spouse can truly \\*help\\* (not be the end all) you find a sense of wholeness and healing and comprehensive support and sometimes a sense of loving even your greatest insecurities. \n\nBut you cannot expect that to \\*come\\* from someone else. That isn’t your spouse’s responsibility. You can’t want to get married so someone else heals you. God is the only One Who deserves that level of trust. \n\nWork on your relationship with Him, work on your own mental, physical, spiritual, psychological nurturing and become the type of person you want to marry. And be the type of person someone else would thank God for marrying.  \nby Sister Maryam Amir",

        "text": "Hi. Can anybody provide me with non-doctrinal arguments for why it is often said that 'God is Love'? As far as I see it, if God is the source of everything, then God must be the source of everything we call 'good', 'evil' and inbetween. Now seeing as the world isn't Eden (no, I don't want to argue the Fall with you), 'evil' shouldn't be that hard to see. Let us examine some of the sublimes of good, and some of the sublimes of evil:\n\nGood:\n* Familial love\n* Romantic love\n* Platonic love (if you're lucky enough to keep your friends, haha)\n* Visual beauty\n* Audible beauty\n* Sweet little things: the chirping robin, the postman who is always on time with your mail\n* Great majestic things: the windswept mountain peak, the church dome\n* Laughter!\n* Fun\n* Kindness\n* Etc.\n\nEvil:\n* Rape\n* Murder\n* Genocide (holocaust!)\n* Torture\n* War (Ukraine!)\n* Slavery\n* Sex slavery\n* Cancer (fairly common...)\n* Heart-attacks\n* Dementia\n* Alzheimer's\n* Starvation\n* Parasitism\n* Predation (from the victim's perspective, for sure, even if it is 'just an animal'! Hence 'sex predator')\n* Stalking\n* Decay (comes with life)\n* Death of loved ones or friends (comes with life)\n* Death of oneself (comes with life)\n* Relationship-breakdown\n* Anxiety (my gift from God)\n* Depression (the gift from God that the girl I like is currently struggling with)\n* Insomnia (knew a girl with this)\n* Delusion (I knew someone with this)\n* Epilepsy (my former friend's gift from God)\n* OCD (another gift of mine from God)\n* Suicidal tendencies from birth (read an article about a dude who was basically in and out of mental hospitals like a drug addict and rehab)\n* Other mental illnesses\n* Severe disability\n\nNow, how can you love God after all of that? ^\n\nA lot of these diseases, FYI, are genetic, which means they're part of 'God's design'.\n\nIf you can't come up with many things that would make you want to die, you're not thinking hard enough, haha. There's a hell of a lot of evil in this world. Lot of good! But a hell of a lot of evil too. Maybe evolution is to blame for producing such flawed biological beings as us and the animals and plants are. Maybe a lot if not all moral evil is actually natural evil. I'm not a psychologist nor biologist though, so I won't say that for sure.\n\nBut basically there's a lot of evil in the world's 'design'. And it's the kind of evil that is hard to argue around.\n\nNow, if you can conceive of something like 'Eden' or 'Heaven' existing, why can't you conceive of those existing right here, right now on earth? It did not have to be this way.\n\nSo my argument is that at the very least 'God'—whatever you want to call 'Ultimate Reality'—is not 'good', not 'love'.\n\nLike the Tao/Brahman/Ein Sof (I think).\n\nScripture references aside, I don't get how any monotheist can conclude from our world that God is 'good' or 'love' or 'perfect'. God it seems to me is just neutral; God just _is_, and is perhaps quite unknowable at that (apophatic theology).\n\nSo, from me to you, Bible etc. aside, take a look at the list I've produced for you, and tell me honestly how you can believe that the Ultimate Reality of this world, 'God' if you like, is either 'good' or 'love'? How can you love the God who attaches all these horrors to the condition of living?\n\nIt's often said that life is a 'gift'. I have one simple response to this idea—actually two:\n* Sometimes; and\n* Inside every cradle is a grave.\n\nAnd this, chaps, is why there are so many atheists/agnostics/irreligious/religiously confused (guess this one's me) people out there. If 'God' wanted more people to like 'Him', 'He' should have done a better job, if he is so wise and perfect, etc.\n\nI honestly think that Positivity Bias is what drives this whole God=good, God=love thing. I won't say God is evil, I'll just say that 'He' (or It/They, as I prefer) _is_.\n\nAnd that's why I don't worship God, and that's why I am still irreligious despite all my spiritual ideations, haha.\n\nJesus, for example, might be an surprisingly (to me) interesting ethical teacher, but his God I could never love. The world makes me angry. The only reason people need to do 'God's Work' is because God evidently isn't doing it 'Himself'.\n\nAnd FYI I don't believe in 'free will'. If materialism is true (which I think not!), then we are just the product of all the physical laws and the history of interactions of matter since the Big Bang. If theism is true, then we are the product of God's nature, and nothing can exist without God, so how could our 'will' be anymore 'free' than the rock is? It's an illusion—one which I am perfectly OK with for my life, but one which is terrible in theodicy. 'free will' is religion's get out of jail card.\n\nAnd on this note, if you know any religions which like Taoism don't believe God is good/love, etc., and which don't worship God I will be interested to hear of them because I'm religiously stranded, haha?\n\nIf you got to the end, thanks for reading.\n\nAnd I wish you all a good night :)",

This appears to be of her saying she was 6 at the time of her marriage. However, I've read that's been disputed, from additional things revealing she was much older, to the person who recorded this quote having bad memory issues and misspeaking.

As a teenager I would get offended by anyone speaking on their religious beliefs and I'd just want to say a bunch of nonsense about science proves that none of it is real blah blah blah. I'm now in my very early 20s (22 in march) and I've really changed my views on religion drastically, I'm still not religious myself however I'm really wanting to expand my knowledge on the topic and get a deep understanding into the religions people believe in. \n\nI realised my ways a few months ago. I'm not sure what changed but maybe it's just I want to be a better version of myself and I noticed that most of the religious people I've come across are super disciplined, well mannered and respectful people, traits that I've been lacking as of late. I'm well mannered however if I get somewhat angry all of that is thrown out the door to which I become a person I wouldn't respect. \n\nTo go out of your way and say your prayers, give your life to something that from a non religious person doesn't exist to me back in the day seemed so stupid but now I see it as such an honourable act. It takes an extreme amount of dedication in your life to do which you can't not respect. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe now that religion can be a great thing for the world to unite people together to make the world function in a happier society than it is today. The reason I'm still not religious myself is due to not feeling the belief, I can't force myself to believe in something it just has to come and show it's self in my life and if it does I'm more welcoming than ever 😌 Thanks for reading",

Therefore,  the sages instructed that the fetus that makes it difficult for the  child is allowed to cut the fetus with her mouth, either with medicine  or with the hand, because he is chasing after her and killing her, and  if he takes out his head, he should not be touched, there is no  repulsion of a soul from a soul, and this is the nature of the universe\"\n\nAnd it is from a Google translated version of this page.

        "text": "Hello! \n\nThe Han Dynasty of China and the Roman Empire are contemporaneous with each other and I know that both were originally polytheistic empires, however I can’t find much information comparing the two.  Overall I am better versed in Roman paganism than in Chinese folk religion.\n\nI know in Rome they worship the 12 olympians.  Rituals were public events and correct procedure was very important.  If a priest messed up the ritual would have to be restarted.  Refusal to participate in a religious ritual was tantamount to treason (which was why the Christians were prosecuted at first).  \n\nI don’t see an equivalent in ancient China for this? Did China not prosecute people for not participating in religious rituals? Or were the rituals much less organized compared with Rome?   Was ancestor worship practiced in Rome? I know in China it’s a major aspect and people burn paper money and incense to appease their ancestors.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, people (and government officials) would hold rituals to pray to certain olympians in times of drought, famine or bad weather.  Did the Chinese blame bad weather or drought on certain angry gods like the Romans? The Romans also practiced libation and animal sacrifice.  It seems like in China they didn’t do this? No animal sacrifices?  Did China have an equivalent to the 12 Olympians (where each god ruled over a certain domain)?\n\nRome also seems to have a very elaborate body of mythology (borrowed from the Greeks of course).  There are explanations for numerous things including sickness (Pandora’s box), winter (kidnap of Persephone), spiders (Athena cursing Arachne), echos (a nymph cursed by Hera), how Athens got its name (competition between Athena and Poseidon) and many more.  It’s also quite clear the relationships, infidelity and marriages between the gods and goddesses.\nIs there an equivalent in ancient China? I don’t see any gods have sexual relations with humans and I don’t know of any explanations for natural phonenoma on the level of the Greeks/Romans.\n\nIn Rome when they conquered other cultures they practiced religious syncretism.  They would identify foreign gods as one of the 12 Olympians or even fuse gods/goddesses together (like when Egyptian gods were combined with Greek ones).  They also called Thor Zeus and Odin “Mercury”.  Note that the Romans were not tolerant of the celts because they supposedly practiced human sacrifice.  When the Chinese conquered Korea and Vietnam did they do something similar? Did they Chinese gods mix with Korean and Vietnamese ones? Did the Han dysnasty chinsse stamp out human sacrifice in foreigners?\n\nSorry for the disorganized questions but I really want to get an overview of the religious beliefs and differences between Rome and ancient China.  I really appreciate any feedback you can give!",

All he’s ever known is water. Let’s say this fish is extraordinarily intelligent and even reflective, logical and analytical. He WANTS to believe in the terrestrial world, but just doesn’t see any proof for it existing. \n\nFurther beyond that, he cannot imagine the terrestrial world even if he wanted to. He is not equipped, nor has he ever experienced anything even tangentially similar to the terrestrial world. Tell the fish to imagine a grizzly bear (like telling a human to imagine an angel). \n\nTo the fish, a grizzly bear sounds like an absurd idea. Air breathing beings stuck to the floor, unable to float above it like in water, seems absurd. The fish needs proof, and other fish won’t be able to give him the proof because they’ve never seen a grizzly bear either, \n\n\nThis fish will be born, live and die having never experienced the terrestrial world, because he was not equipped in any way to do so. *but that doesn’t mean the terrestrial world doesn’t exist”. \n\nWe can extend this to the concept of heaven and a creator. We very well may not be equipped biologically to detect or interact with a spirit world/heaven/god himself. \n\nYou don’t need to believe in any specific religion, and I’m not supporting  or dismissing any religion either.

This is causing significant ecological, economic, and social consequences for the people who depend on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdil8cvzz3ea1.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=faf38ab37984ef7bfd003f0045641cb990977a62\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [TLDR: ](https://youtube.com/shorts/MglzNNP5B3A)[Facts About The Euphrates River In 50 sec](https://youtube.com/shorts/MglzNNP5B3A) &lt; &lt; (Video)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the most concerning facts about the Euphrates River drying up is that it is mentioned in the Bible, specifically in the book of Revelation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hp2377u604ea1.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35c75a2a084cfadce4fcd84c77755dffda152b70\n\nRevelation 16:12 states, \"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.\" This passage, along with others in Revelation, indicate that the drying up of the Euphrates River is a sign of the end times and the second coming of Christ. This is a significant concern for many people who take the Bible's predictions seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d2qpgs104ea1.jpg?width=1114&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1f73f718d01732e0b08504386dc2ae4480941eec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnl4hgs104ea1.jpg?width=630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=062b39311f255a099c1c287579f35830ccc0522d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84jbxbvb04ea1.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c7d85dc7c43e97f55b187a008ec13bb29dedb131\n\nIn addition to the religious implications, the drying up of the Euphrates River is also related to current conflicts in the region. Revelation 9:11 states, \"They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.\" This passage is often interpreted as a reference to a great conflict or war. In the current world, the region surrounding the Euphrates River is a source of tension and conflict between different countries and ethnic groups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ieajv7u604ea1.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bdd0ad461cff9e2d2b4e9a21cade3c8affe3fd12\n\nThe drying up of the Euphrates River is also causing economic and social consequences for the people who depend on it. The river is a major source of irrigation for crops and a source of water for industry and households. The lack of water is causing food shortages and economic hardships for people in the region.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [Do You Believe This Is An Omen Or Just A Coincidence?](https://youtube.com/shorts/MglzNNP5B3A)",

For instance why is it more likely Jesus was resurrected than Muhammad was visited by an angel or vice versa? I am drawn to a an animated worldview and duality, but also believe in good and evil as well as the existence of things beyond science or the secular understanding of reality.\n\nBelievers, how do you logically explain the existence of a specific diety and the corresponding scripture in your minds? I'm curious because I hope to eventually be able to believe myself, but accepting a specific religious truth feels more limiting and less logical than just being totally open minded to any possible existence or lack of existence of a higher power. I do not mean to be disrespectful, just genuinely trying to learn.",

Please feel free to disagree.  \n\n*Assumption (A)*\nSo God knows who will go to heaven given a starting condition for the universe. \n\n*Assumption (B)*\nGiven slightly different starting conditions, one could argue that the list of the ones going to heaven would be drastically more different. My thought process for thinking that is as follows:\n\n*B.1*\nI mean, in the first place, which sperm gets to enter the egg first is largely chaotic and could vary with the slightest change like the hour of reproduction. This would mean either a totally different person with a different soul being born, or the same soul in a different body. Both of these would, arguably, result in very different life experiences than had another sperm gotten to the egg first. \n\n*B.2*\nBut god chose one of these possibilities and as such, made a preference for that person to go to heaven or hell. \n\n*Conclusion (C)*\nThank you if you got to this part! Here is what I conclude from A and B:\n\n*C.1*\nPlease mark that I do think these people have logical capabilities to make their own decisions. And if that’s accepted as having free will, then I think that people have free will. \n\n*C.2*\nHowever, with the argument B.2, we can see that it is ultimately God who chooses who gets to go to heaven and hell. \n\nIs my thought process correct? Thank you everyone for your constructive feedback and pointing out my mistakes! Good day to y’all",

I was reading through an older Reddit post and saw someone say that they died from a heart attack (and got resurrected) and saw “the tree of life” and “a 3 eyed deer” (which one would assume is Eikþyrnir and Yggdrasil) and I just wondered if there’s any evidence like this for other religions, because usually people say they saw angels or heaven when they die for a few minutes.

        "text": "The Catholic Church interpreted and mistranslated the Bible. They persecuted anyone with different opinions and that’s why their interpretation was the main influence. Hypocritically the very basis of Christianity is faith. Faith has no preconceptions, it’s just simply trusting the universe. Yet the church forced their own preconceptions of God. \n\nThe popular Christian viewpoint is the Bible is a literal event. As if it actually occurred. It’s obvious though the Bible is an allegorical story. Using metaphors, and numerology to tell deeper philosophical teachings. Believing the Bible as a literal event is the same as believing Egyptian, or Greek mythology as fictional. Yet this type of thinking makes people completely miss the philosophical ideas.\n\nThe mainstream view is that by default we deserve punishment because we can’t live to the same standards as Christ. This interpretation is an impossible Gospel to fulfill. It institutionalizes guilt as a virtue. Having a single God influencing the world creates the separation of man and nature. In reality man and nature are interconnected. \n\nAlso the only way to salvation is through Christ. If that was true, that would mean God would predestine people to Hell. Most Eastern cultures were never exposed to Christ. \n\n“Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet. Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.” Napoleon Bonaparte\n\n“Hell” and “Heaven are metaphors for states of mind. For example, lust is a sin. Not because it’s necessarily morally bad which is how it’s usually interpreted. But because desire causes internal suffering.  Sins such as, envy, anger, greed, gluttony, laziness, and pride, all cause internal and external suffering. Which is the manifestation of hell. \n\n“Jesus Christ” was a manifestation of how to reach heaven/enlightenment through his wisdom and acts. Him dying on the cross is symbolic of faith. Trusting everything will work out and he will rise again. And acceptance of any suffering. \n\nIn the Bible it says we are “made in the image of God”. We have the “Holy Spirit” flowing throughout us. “The eye is lamp of the body”. “I said, “You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you;”. \n\nThese are all metaphors suggesting we are all God. That we are part of a collective consciousness. We are the universe experiencing itself. I mention this because it relates to ideas in Hinduism. \n\nHindus believe that everything is God. We are the universe experiencing itself for “divine play”. A “collective consciousness”, which the Bible describes as the “Holy Spirit”.  That’s why Hindus believe in reincarnation because we are all the same consciousness, having an experience. Our identities are constructs created by the mind so we can be fully immersed in the experience. Meditation is the process of removing your ego/identity and realizing that man, nature and the universe are interconnected and the same. \n\n\"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.”\n\nMeaning remove your ego and connect with God. Cross being symbolic of faith. Praying is self contemplation. If you have things going wrong in your life, contemplate and an answer will manifest itself. Our body is are temple or sanctuary. It’s not a physical location like a Church.  \n\nEvidence of a collective consciousness would be in nature. When animals are born they naturally know how to survive. We naturally learn how to walk. Nobody has to teach us, we just do it. \n\nFaith in Christ and you will be reborn again. \n\nPraying is supposed too be contemplation. If you sit and meditate on what you’re doing wrong in life, an answer will manifest. \n\nWhy does God allow Satan to exist? Satan is the metaphor for deception and Evil. If we are all God experiencing itself, than Satan would create conflict. Conflict would make the experience of life more interesting. \n\nEvidence that Jesus and Lucifer are the same is hidden in its numerology. \nJesus=74\nLucifer=74\n\nLucifer also means light bringer. Jesus says he is the light of the world. \n\nThese two figures are different manifestations of the human psyche. One can cause you enlightenment, “Heaven”. The other will bring you “Hell”.",

I enjoy talking to you guys about different theories on God, the afterlife etc. \n\nMaltheism is the belief that an evil deity or god exists, who takes pleasure from our suffering.\n\nI have a few questions regarding the maltheism. These are all hypothetical\n\n\n1. Could an evil deity or god take pleasure from our suffering, and send us to hell after we die? For its pleasure and desire. This deity enjoys our suffering\n\n2. Is an pure evil god or deity capable of good?\n\n3. Could an evil deity fool us or trick us with this life which has joy, beauty and happiness, only to send us to eternal suffering? \n\n4. If an evil deity or even God exists, would it be capable of being omniscient? \n\n5. Does animal suffering point to an evil creator? \n\n6. If hell is real, does that make God evil? \n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you guys think\n\nCiao",

And it shows that Satan and Demons are these destructive malevolent entities. They want to harm and destroy. \n\nSo here is where I’m confused. Someone told me to google the satanic temple and read the tenants and they all seem very, reasonable? \n\n1. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.\n\nThis doesn’t seem very…. Evil?\n\n2. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.\n\nNeither does this… in fact none of them do. So what the hell is going on? \n\n….The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n\n…. Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n\n\n…. People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n\n\n…. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.",

And in this movie a student named Josh enrolls in a philosophy class taught by an atheist professor. Said professor demands that his students sign a declaration that \"God is dead\" in order to pass the class. But Josh is the only one who refuses and the professor then requires Josh to debate him and make his case for why God is not dead. \n\nThe aforementioned statement \"God's not Dead\" is taken from a statement made by the philosopher Nietzsche who said in full \"God is dead, and we have killed him\". He expounds on this by saying that everything that was built upon faith is bound to collapse, to be summary. \n\nNow, if you as a theist were in Josh's position, what would you do?",
