        "text": "Mine happened when I had been delivering for about 4 months.\n\nIt had been an unusually busy Friday night, and I was taking the last delivery of the night, at about 12:30 am. It's 30 minutes after close, and I'm anxious to get this over with and go home.\n\nThis particular delivery was going to a lower-middle class condo complex, all first floor units. I make my way to the back of the complex, and knock lightly on the door (don't want to be too loud and wake the neighbors). Nobody answers. I knock a little louder, and then a little louder still. I'm debating calling the customer when a very disheveled, *very* angry looking dude wrenches the door open. \"What the fuck, I didn't order any pizza!\" \n\nI'm freaking out internally. I didn't mean to wake anyone up, but I confirmed with the guy, the address on the receipt was indeed his apartment. It turns out the pizza is for his girlfriend, who is in the pool. The pool, of course, is aaaaaaaalll the way on the other side of the complex. So, because I am a lazy shit, I get back in my car and drive over there.\n\nI arrive at the pool, and I spot two girls in the hot tub. As I walk closer it becomes apparent they are *very* drunk, and it takes me a couple tries to get their attention. I start out with my spiel, \"Hi there, your total is X, how are you tonight?\"\n\nThe first girl goes to get her wallet, while the second girl runs over to open the pool gate. Girl #1 declares that she has forgotten the money in her car. Girl #2, after some considerable effort with the gate, suddenly remembers how they got into the pool in the first place. They jumped the fence, of course, because it's after hours!\n\nFabulous. I briefly consider leaving when Girl #2 drags a plastic table over to the side of the fence. Girl #1 stumbles over to where I am, and asks if I could hold their cell phones and the rest of their beer while they hop the fence. Gotta have our priorities, y'know.\n\nGirl #1 goes first, successfully climbing over the fence and landing on the decorative rocks on the other side. Girl #2, however, is having a minor panic attack, and is afraid the rocks will hurt when she jumps on them. Girl #1 tries to reassure her, and offers to catch her as she jumps down.\n\nGirl #2, instead of swinging her body around the top of the fence and climbing down the other side like Girl #1, opts to stand on the top of the fence and balance herself with a nearby tree, then crouch and gently slide off from the top.\n\nThis goes about as well as expected. As she is sliding down into Girl #1's arms, Girl #2's tube top bikini catches on one of the metal bars of the fence, and she is left dangling, funbags fully out, from the fence for about 10 seconds.\n\nBoth girls are now freaking the fuck out. #1 is laughing hysterically and #2 is screaming and crying, it's now after 1 am, they're waking up the neighbors, and I'm contemplating suicide via broken beer bottle.\n\nThen Girl #2's bikini top snaps. She collapses to the ground with a pretty decent scratch on her back from the fence, titties still a-swingin' in the wind, and she proceeds to scream-cry at Girl #1 for not catching her.\n\nAt this point there are at least three neighbors who have come out of their condos to see what all the ruckus is about, one of whom immediately went back inside, leading me to believe this isn't a terribly uncommon occurrence here.\n\nGirl #1 picks Girl #2 up off the ground, and they run off into the ether to get the money for the pizza. I thought again about leaving, but I was still holding the girls' cell phones (and beer), and I figured if I left them at the pool someone would probably steal them, which I would likely be blamed for later, so I stayed put and made a quick call to my manager instead.\n\nAfter about 10 more minutes, the girls (with #2 now sporting a t-shirt) return with about $40, leaving me with a $15 tip. I asked repeatedly if they were sure they didn't want any change, and they replied it was the least they could do for making me put up with their bullshit. \n\nIt's now 1:45 am, and I finally return to the store, cash out, and head home.\n\nOne of the girls proceeded to call the store the next day and complain that I had refused to give their change back. \n\nSuch is life as a delivery driver.

I had a credit card receipt, and tried to call after her to no avail. \n\nSoon as she came outside she went, \"OH! You're with Domino's?! Why didn't you say something?\" I just told her to have a good night and went across the street to the correct house. I told them about the mistake and we had a good laugh about it. They even tipped me $10 and a full size candy bar! That house remains one of my favorites to deliver to. ",

I am back in school now in a close-by college town, and I don't find the wear and tear on my vehicle to be worth the trouble that I am about to lay out.\n\nAnyway, here we go. I have been pissed on by a customer's dog ($2 tip even though they saw it happen, and they laughed it off), I've been solicited for prostitution (with three long hunting knives laid out on a hotel table directly behind the customer), I was harassed multiple times a week by individuals either sexually or with vaguely harmful intentions, and was once actually surrounded by a group of men.\n\nI had a proudly self-proclaimed \"crazy\" manager (who was consistently volatile, and still is the last I heard) throw a pizza cutter full-force in my direction as I worked the oven.\n\nI also had a homeless 50 year old coworker that drove his ex's stolen jeep, and who was a drunk who spent his daily tips on bar tabs and hooker fuck sessions in the regional upstairs office of our shack of a building. Somehow, our female general manager was creepily sympathetic towards his violently shitty behavior, even though he consistently and openly complained about both how he hated women, and how he wasn't able to save up enough to afford a home of his own.  \n\nI had a another coworker who cheated on his wife with yet another coworker in the back room (making out on coke racks and in the walk-in) while the store manager again did nothing. I then watched that wife (also a coworker, 400 lbs., toothless and illiterate) open-mouth suck and maw the meat off our fatty, once-cooked chicken wings because I was too scared of losing my job to just tell her to fuck off while she followed me around the store smacking grease and saliva down her jowls.\nShe did the same another time while gumming at alfredo noodles...I nearly puked.\n\nWe had a possible pedophiliac coworker that was 50+ years manipulate himself into a 13 year old girl's home (she was home alone and her mother was PISSED.) I still feel like my general manager should have fired him on the spot based off of what I heard from another good manager friend of mine. \n\nAnd then there was one of our own that actually managed to last for years, who has had 12 women who have come out about his sexual harassment (cornering women into areas of the store with no cameras so that he could solicit sex; unblinking/constant eye contact and smiling as he watched women work, and general fucked up/sexual comments etc.) has been granted one of the most profitable stores in our state. He's probably making six figures right now.\n\nEveryone that I know who mutually knows him, and feels comfortable speaking honestly with me about him, fucking HATES HIM.\n\nThat's it.

We aren't asking for your parent's or your partner's or your friend's or any other random phone number you seem to want to give us.\n\nYou see, when we go to deliver your order, the phone number you gave us (or got auto-populated into the order because you called from that number) is plastered all over every sticker in the largest font possible.  So that's the number we're going to call first in the event of any problem.  Only if that number doesn't work are we going to search the box looking for a note; in tiny font, perhaps cut off because you included too many instructions that we most likely already knew, perhaps on a sticker that got pasted to some random location on the box because there's really only room for the real sticker and then the phone number on that sticker faded away from the heat.\n\nAn example.  You live in the dorm, and your parents want to send you a pizza.  So they go online and enter their phone number.  Then in the comments is says something like \"My precious angel is at State University, please call her at xxx-xxx-xxxx when you arrive at her dorm and she will come downstairs to meet you.\"  Let's decipher this on a what we need to know basis.  First off, you forgot to include which dorm your precious angel lives at.  Secondly, everyone thinks this is the first time we've been to a dorm and don't know the procedure.  Guess what? We make a living off delivering to campus, and have the procedure down pat.  All we need is a dorm name and a phone number, we got it!  Thirdly, that massive info blurb doesn't fit on our main label, here's what we end up seeing:  My precious ang.  That's it.  Then we have to search for that other label, printed in tiny font, at night to get the phone number we need (after we called you and woke you up.)\n\nWhat to do in the above situation:  When you are placing the order for your kid, use their phone number in the online ordering process.",

        "text": "Long time delivery driver/lurker here. First post. I've been delivering for a local bar/grill for longer than I care to admit, even to strangers. Most of my stories are too mundane or wierd to write down and post. But I got some decent revenge on a no tip the other night I think my fellow drivers will enjoy.\nIt was a decently busy Friday night and we got an order in about 9 pm or so going to the zoo. They were open late and running this holloween event for kids so there were little monsters and ninjas and moanas running all over the place. It took me a solid 15 minutes to make it through the parking lot to the entrance of the zoo. I made it up to the counter and, of course, nobody knew who ordered food. So I call the number they gave me and, of course, nobody answers. So now I have to find this zoo employee in a zoo at night. Among kids. \nAfter another 20 minutes of asking around I decided to give up. I made it half way to my car when a lady runs up to me and says she's been looking for me and she's the one who ordered the food. I was more than a little annoyed but I swallowed my sarcasm and politely gave her the food and she handed me a wad of money and said thanks quickly and walked away. The ticket was $54.19. I counted only 54$. Oh you bitch. Not tonight. I made my way back through the entrance and found her unbagging the food with the other people who obviously threw in. Now I've been doing this a long time. So I knew instantly what she had done with everybody's money. She paid me and kept the tip. \nI walked up to the group and let my anger creep up as I walked. By the time I got to them, I was almost quivering with rage. I think it gave me credibility because when I stormed up and barked out, \"You owe me 19 cents!\" she jumped out of her skin and turned a deep red and immediately grabbed for her purse to fish out some money. No questioning or arguing. She knew what she did.\nThe others reacted better than I could have hoped. They all slowly turned to her and asked what, exactly, she had done with the money the gave her for a tip, which was supposed to be around 15 dollars all together. This grown woman, probably in her 40s with a good stable job and the respect of her peers, had to fish 15 dollars out of her purse, all lumped together further damning her, and walk through the others standing there, and hand me the money without a word. I took it, gave everyone else a quick nod as I said thanks, and walked away.\nI turned around once and saw her standing there looking at her food as the others walked away shaking their heads. She was just standing there with her head down. Looking at the price she paid. \nI laughed all the way back to the store.\n\nHope you enjoyed my story, brothers and sisters. Drive safe. Make that money.",

It was just me and another driver working at the time and even though he was next in line to take it, he wanted to leave early to go do whatever, so he started on his sidework while I took it.\n\nSo I show up, ring the bell, knock three times and yell PIZZA GUY'S HERE as per instructions. I get invited in, drop the pizza off, and get treated with a $90 cash tip. I don't know if they were drug dealers or just super nice to me because I went to high school with them or what, but when I got back, the server who took the order playfully asked \"Did you do all the stuff he asked you to do\" and I was like \"Yea and I got a $90 tip\". Everyone was surprised, except for the guy who wanted to leave early!\n\nSo moral of the story - don't try to bust ass and leave early because you never know what the next delivery's gonna be like.",

She answers and says she'll meet me downstairs. \n\nSo I'm waiting in the lobby. I'm standing there waiting ten minutes when four men walk into the lobby (not from the main entrance but from deeper in the building): two are security guards, and two are men in suits. They're talking. I tune in enough to know that it sounds like they're reporting to supervisors about building security and whatnot. \n\nThen my customer comes down and stiffs me for all the waiting I did. It was not my first stiff of the day. In fact, it was a downright shitty day. I either got stiffed or $2 until the end. But I still went through my whole delivery routine with a smile on my face, and then exited gritting my teeth. \n\nOutside though, one of the men who was wearing suits came out after me. \n\n\"Excuse me, but I saw how you handled that customer and I was wondering if you were interested in a part-time job with my company.\"\n\nHe hands me his business card. He is the CEO of a local security company. I had been thinking about getting another job for a good long while.

You have your allowance.\" he comes walking up to me in the car as I'm about to drive off \"Here you go, my dad said I can't keep this. I'm sorry.\"\n\nI responded to him \"Your dad understands we aren't paid a liveable wage, and that tips make or break us. It's okay! Thank you so much, and tell your father I said thank you.\" ",

        "text": "Not a pizza delivery person, but I do have a pizza polemic to share from about a year ago.\n\nA few classmates and I ordered some pizzas for a party for the year 7 students we were prefecting for their school camp soon. I ordered the pizzas on the phone before one of my lessons started, or at least I tried to. It took about 15 minutes to order because the connection at my school is terrible and I kept getting put on hold for no good reason. Eventually I got the order through to them for four pizzas and asked them if they could deliver them at 1:10, which is when lunchtime at our school starts and when the party would begin. I called them at around 11:55, and I didn't want to call any later because I was in a lesson and wanted the pizza to get there on time.\n\nNow, some context: \n- The reason the language barrier was a problem is because the main language here is Chinese and I don't speak a word of it. \n- I ordered four pizzas: two margarita and two meat lovers. The pizzas aren't good quality but we order them all the time because they have a high discount for school orders.\n- At the time I also had very severe anxiety, depression and problems with self-harming that nobody knew about at the time.\n\nI spent my whole lesson before lunch terrified that I'd gotten the order wrong or that they wouldn't show up - I didn't want to let anyone down. So when lunch started, my three classmates went upstairs to entertain the kids and I waited at the school entrance for the pizza.\n\n1:15 - no pizza. No big deal. Was expecting a bit of a delay - that's why I called early.\n\n1:25 - I call them up to ask about the order. They put me on hold, transfer me several times and eventually say it's on it's way, no timeframe given. They may also have forgotten I made the order at one point but I don't remember exactly.\n\n1:35 - I call them again, same deal. At this point lunch is halfway over and a prefect (a friend of mine at the time) calls me to say that our dragon lady of a teacher is yelling at them for the lack of pizza. And it's started to rain.\n\nFinally, at 1:45, they call back to tell me the pizza will be there in 10 minutes, after repeatedly saying before that they'd call me back when they knew that the order was coming. They never did. I had to chase them up.\n\nAt this point I was nearly in tears, and just before the last call came I considered giving up and going to the disabled toilet to cut myself for the 3rd time that day. I might still have done that if it wasn't for one of my classmates coming down to check on me. Let's call him UF (Uber Friendo).\n\nMe (visibly agitated): 10 minutes. Finally, they called. It'll be there in 10 minutes.\nUF: Okay. We managed to keep the year 7s happy - (friendo prefect) is playing games with them.\nMe: Good\n...\nMe: I am so sorry. I called them beforehand and I followed up every 10 minutes but they didn't tell me anything-\n\n(I will never forget what UF said next - it's why he's an uber friendo, not just a regular one)\n\nUF: Hey, calm down. It's coming now. There's nothing else you could have done. You did all you could, and it's not your fault. Nobody's angry at you. You did everything you could, so don't feel bad about this, okay?\nMe: *nods*\n...\nUF: Come inside. Stop standing in the rain.\n\nEventually the pizza arrived, I wanted to die a little less and everyone else was happy. Yay.\n\nLe End\n",

        "text": "So this happened a few years ago when I was a driver for Dominos in Australia.  \n     \nI was doing the close shift, so I was driving the store’s car. It was a Toyota Echo. If anyone isn’t familiar with that, it was the smallest car sold by Toyota and was a tiny front wheel drive thing with no power.  \n    \nI head out on a delivery. It was two pizzas, a garlic bread and a coke and it was to a house that was on the border of our area and I hadn’t been to this street before. When I get there, it is an amazing street. It’s an incredibly steep hill that’s heaps higher than the rest of the suburb. The hill levels out and there is an amazing view all the way to the CBD in one direction and probably, on a good day, all the way to the bay in the opposite direction, but it’s night time, so I can just see the city lights.  \n    \nI find the house without too many worries and pull up on the street, with the car pointing back down the hill, so I can just drive straight out of the street, no messing around. The driveway is long…and dark. I can’t find the front door. The house has a strange curve to it, the path just follows the front of the house, there is ivy growing up the wall of the house and the curve just keeps going and going and going. No windows, no doors. What the fuck? Finally, I figure out that the house is a converted town water storage tank. COOL! Knowing that, I realise that the curve is actually a circle – pick a direction and follow it. Eventually I’ll hit a front door or a fence. If it’s not this way it’s gotta be the other.    \n    \nSo I finally find the front door and knock on it. After a while, a youngish guy answers the door and asks if I had any problems finding the door. “No,” I lie. He’s fumbling with change and seems very embarrassed. I can’t remember what the order cost, but we’ll say it was $30 for the sake of the story and all numbers are approximated. He says, “I thought I had more cash. I only have $20.” This is uncomfortable but has happened before. This is about 15 years ago, so I don’t have a portable credit card machine with me. I ask if he has a card. He can call the store, pay over the phone and then they’ll call me and let me know I can hand the food over. He says he doesn’t have a card. This is a **nice** house by the way. So now we’re in an uncomfortable position. Minimum order for a delivery is $15 and that gets you one pizza and a drink. I know all the coupons off by heart and $19.90 gets you two large pizzas deliverd. So I tell him I can leave the pizzas but I have to take the coke and garlic bread back. I know full well that the garlic bread is going in the bin, but I don’t know this guy and I’m not getting lectured by my manager because this dude ordered pizza before looking in his wallet which totally has a credit card in it because he’s an adult. He gets narky and asks why I can’t just give him the food for $20. I lie and say that if my till is down at the end of the shift it comes out of my wages. It’s a lie I’ve told a lot when people are 2 or 3 bucks short. I say the 2 large for $19.90 is the best I can do. Or he can take the one pizza and the drink for $15. He gets angry, tells me to go fuck myself and he doesn’t want any of it and slams the door.  \n     \nThis is great news because when I get back – these pizzas are for all of us to share.  \n    \n10 minutes later and I am back at the shop, I walk in the door and my manager, who is early 20s and pretty cool, is waiting for me and goes, “What the fuck happened on that delivery?” I don’t quite understand how she knew anything had happened, so I just explain the situation – they didn’t have enough cash, I offered what I could, they said no, so I left. She tells me that the person had called the store FURIOUS and said that I had abused the shit out of them, refused to give them the pizzas *for no reason* and then opened the boxes, threw the pizzas on the road and then did *the biggest burnout they had ever seen* **over** *the pizzas and all the way down the street.*” I just point at the two pristine pizza boxes I just set down and say, “These pizzas? I did a burn out, in the *echo* over these pizzas?” She has a look and can see the pizzas clearly don’t have tire tracks through them. Looks back up at me, and goes, “They’re fucking crazy. They *believe* you threw them on the ground.”  \n    \nThe address was black listed and we refused to delivery to them ever again.  \n    \nI still think about that delivery every few months. I still have no idea what they were thinking. I don’t understand why they ordered pizza if they really had no money. I don’t understand how they had no money given where they lived – even if they were house sitting, the kind of person the home owner would get to house sit them wouldn’t be scratching for their last 30 bucks. I don’t know how they thought lying about something I could physically prove didn’t happen would do anything. If they had of said I just abused the shit out of them or that I was racist or sexist or something they may have been believed, but to give such detail about the pizzas on the ground, burnouts in car that can’t do burnouts (although a story for another time is how I learnt to do 360s in the echo in the rain). I just don’t understand what they were trying to  do or how they thought it would work.",

        "text": "I've recently started driving for Pizza Hut. Used to do so for Papa Johns, but honestly - Pizza Hut is just better for me in every way. Minimum wage is garunteed while on the road, and I feel like the people that order with this company is better. But today... Man. Today was a *day*...\n\nOne of my deliveries saw me going to a nearby neighborhood. This one seemed really easy. 24$order for a single 'dinner box.' I go up to the door, ring the doorbell. No answer. Knock once. No answer. Knock again. Finally get someone to come to the door. \n\nAwesome. Taller gentlemen answers the door, and I smile and do my best to give my usual service. He seems a bit quiet, but honestly. I'm just the delivery guy. So I pass him the pizza, and let him know the total. \n\n\"Alright, let me get your money.\"\n\nHe turns and steps away. Slams the door in my face. Locks it. Honestly. I have the benefit of the doubt with people. I wait a few minutes - before I knock to try and get his attention. \n\nNo answer. Yeap. I have someone trying to stiff on paying after taking the pizza. So I walk to my car to get my phone, call my boss, ask what the best method here is. \n\nThey tell me simply to call the police. So I do so. Awesome. They're dispatching an officer. \n\nA few minutes pass by, and a car is pulling into the driveway. Oh, this is good to see! I don't know these people. As they pulled up? The door quickly opens, and the guy drops the pizza box on the porch. \n\nI walk up, and call out to them to let them know what happened. \n\nSomeone here ordered a pizza - locked the door without paying - I've called the police. She goes inside to talk to the guy that ordered. \n\nThe one that pulled up was the landowner. An extremely kind woman with her (I assume) husband and daughter as they had pulled up. Appearantly she had allowed the person who ordered to live there while he was going through a difficult time in his life. She was ready to pay for the pizza. And we were working on getting things taken care of. \n\nUltimately, the police *do* pull up, despite trying to cancel the dispatch. The police hear the story, and they try to address the young man. He's a 19 year old male. They're trying to tell him you *can't do this* and it's against the law. They even mention he's very close to going to jail. But the kid just doesn't care. He ignores them, messing with his phone and just shows disregard, saying 'I don't care. Just take the pizza back.\" \n\nUltimately, I think he basically got evicted. He leaves after getting told to leave. The landowner ultiamtely winds up paying for the order and taking the pizza - even commenting that 'they were going to order pizza tonight anyways.' and even makes sure I get a nice tip for the time lost. \n\nIt... just was a weird situation. I feel bad for the kid, despite what happened. It hits close to home - my own older brother got thrown out a number of times. And this guy just didn't seem to know what it was like having people care about you and your well being to help you improve. \n\nFor some reason it's unnerving. I didnt' feel good about this delivery at all. I didn't feel like there was anything I could do to help. Even saw the kid still walking as I drove away. It makes my heart sink a bit thinking about it. ",

        "text": "So I was on shift for my store and we have a fairly large delivery radius especially when going to the west of the city. The further you go west, the less developed the city becomes. It's a lot of un lit roads and trailer parks without paved roads that extend into heavily wooded areas. I had a delivery to a very small trailer on the very edge of our radius.\n\nHere is my tale of how not to deliver the pizza\n\nStep 1. Don't read the delivery sticker thoroughly \n\nStep 2. Forget the sodas (two 2Liters of Coke)\n\nStep 3. Miss the turn off and get very lost on one way dirt roads in pitch black. Search the area for 15 minutes before finding an even smaller dirt path leading to the lone trailer at the end of the road.\n\nStep 4. The one thing to do correctly, call the customer and confirm you are at the right place.\n\nStep 5. Turn off car and take keys out of fear you will lock yourself out of the car.\n\nStep 6. Lock car.\n\nStep 7. Realize your headlights were the only source of light and unlock the car and restart it so you can see.\n\nStep 8. Customer asks where the sodas are so you leave to the nearest gas station to pick up drinks. This gas station is halfway back to the store.\n\nStep 9. Find out the station only has warm 2 Liters. \n\nStep 10. Struggle once again with finding the address.\n\nStep 11. Repeat steps 4-7\n\nStep 12. Forget what just happened in steps 5-7 and lock yourself out of the car \n\nStep 13. Call your girlfriend to bring your spare keys so you can get into the car\n\nStep 14. While waiting get called by the homeowner asking why you haven't left. Explain to them how stupid you are.\n\nStep 15. Girlfriend will arrive after a 20 minute awkward wait.\n\nStep 16. Find out your car will not unlock while it is on and running.\n\nStep 17. Pop open your trunk, push down the back seats and shamefully crawl into the front seat to turn off the car and unlock it.\n\nStep 18. Drive your peeved girlfriend back to the house\n\nStep 19. Explain why a 25 minute delivery took nearly 90 minutes to your boss.\n\nTL;DR delivery gone horribly wrong all because of easily avoided mistakes at every turn",

The only difference was I had a new driver with me who was still training, and they require new drivers to go on three runs with current drivers to see how it's done. So the two of us walk up to the door and a guy answers, pays, etc. Finally he puts the pizza down and starts talking to us.\n\n\"You guys ever think about joining the Army?\"\n\nWe weren't sure what to say. I told him I was focusing on finishing my degree, but I don't remember what the trainee said. The guy continued talking to us about it, the benefits, etc.\n\n\"It pays better than pizza delivery!\" he said. I just thought to myself \"I hope it does. Otherwise we've got a problem.\" But I didn't say that. He handed us his recruiter card and told us to think about it and give him a call if we were interested. He was nice enough but the whole exchange was just a little awkward.\n\nWe got back to the store and I slapped the recruiter card on my GM's desk. He was former Army. He looked at it and looked at me and was like \"The hell is this?\" I told him what happened. He got irritated. He said \"I don't need someone taking my workers. Look at me u/Juball. Don't join the Army. I don't recommend it.\" He said he was going to call the guy and talk to him but I don't think he ever did\n\nNothing too crazy, but overall I just thought it was a funny story and it's one of the few that sticks out from delivering.",

I decided to go ahead with the interview because I called the closer location to see if they had at least seen my application, but they let me know their hiring manager is on vacation for a few weeks, and I'm wanting a job sooner rather than later. So I'm wondering what my odds would be if I wanted to transfer to the closer location after the farther one gets a few more drivers.",

        "text": "Me and some of my coworkers disagree on this, so I feel it appropriate to ask the community: Do you prefer taking cash or credit deliveries?\nPersonally, I prefer cash deliveries. I work for Pizza Hut, and once in a while, I forget to dispatch myself for deliveries. If it's a cash order, then it doesn't really matter, but if it's a credit order, and I forget, my boss usually makes me go back to get a signature. I also end up with less pens the more credit orders I take, since sometimes the customer keeps them, and I don't notice. I also sort of feel like I'm more likely to get stiffed if I'm taking a credit order. On a (ex. 23.44 order), a stiffer would probably give me 25 dollars if it's a cash order and not ask for change, but on a credit, they just sign their name, and leave the total/tip blank. I find that it's very rare that I get an exact change payment in cash, but not that rare for people to sign the receipt without filling out anything. \n\nBut that's just my experience. Occasionally, a customer will ask which us driver's prefer, and since I don't want to speak for all of us, I'd like to hear your preference, as well as the reason why. \n\nAnd also, if you deliver for a place that actually has drivers use a credit card scanner, I would like to know what that's like, and how it differs from having the customers sign receipts.

They always pay cash. Never once on a card, and they are very strict about NOT receiving a receipt. \n\nThis business is very obviously an illegal gambling den. The building is part of a smaller strip mall that is all owned by 1 family. There are signs and  advertisments on every door, except for this one. Walking in the front door you  immediately see tons of video poker machines, slot machines, and various other electronic gambling machines.\n\nToday I was the one elected to take the delivery. I bagged up the order and drove down to the business.\n\nWhen I got there and parked, I noticed a police officer standing by the door I was to deliver to. I thought that was odd because I never see Police around this area.  As I walked to go inside the police officer put his arm out and told me not to go inside. One of the owners came outside and told me to go into the convenience store 2 doors down to collect payment. Shortly after he said this, about 15 to 20 people came pouring out of the door to the den. Most of them were upset, but one lady was screaming at the owner, \"What about my 5 dollars?! Y'all owe me 5 dollars. This is insane!\"\n\nI went into the store to get payment and the guy seemed super super nervous. I walked back outside and there were now 5 police cars and 2 K9 units in the lot, the gambling den was getting raided. And the owner was in tears talking to the cop that stopped me.\n\nDrove back to the store and shared the good news.\n\nThen posted it here",

If the cause of the lateness was not slow delivery, but some other factor such as it came out of the oven late, same question. \n\n4. What was the hourly wage and driver fee around this time?\n\n5.

Fully embracing my new life as a middle-aged, separated woman, I changed into a caftan, opened another bottle of chardonnay, turned on the TV, and ordered some delivery. My order consisted of salad, a side of grilled chicken breast, and a couple other non-pizza items. So continuing to get toasted on white wine, I settled in to wait for my food. A little while later, I heard the crunching of tires in the driveway and got up to open the door. I noticed that the delivery driver had both a red pizza bag, which presumedly contained my hot, non-pizza food, and a separate brown paper bag for my cold stuff. When the delivery guy reached the door, he held out the red pizza bag to me. My brain thought, \"Oh, he's handing me the wrong bag,\" but I swear, it was like my brain couldn't communicate to my hand in time, and I reached out and took it from him anyway. Then we both stood there for a few seconds staring at each other, the Jamaican delivery driver with the paper bag of food and the Real Housewino with the red pizza bag. Cue the mutual mumbling, \"Oh. Ha. Uh. Yeah. This is yours. Heh. Oops. Sorry,\" as we both awkwardly exchanged bags. It was kinda nice to know I wasn't getting toasted alone.",

Sundays the company I worked for had more chefs come down because we would get so busy, and because of this they would have me do deliveries on the beach.\n\nNaturally it's a lot of walking and there's a ton of people around, but I'm sticking in the same domain the entire time and see reoccurring faces.\n\nOne couple, probably late 40s, had been talking to me as I'd walk by them and seemed pretty inebriated. They eventually ask me to place an order.\n\nThey asked if we served alcohol and I said no. Then they ask if we had any frozen drinks that would mix well with vodka or fireball. So, my suspicion was confirmed-- they're drunk. The beach I worked at prohibited drinking, not that it's that important of a detail.\n\nAnyway I place their order, then come back to them with their food. I notice in the woman's bikini bottom is a $20 sticking out. The guy pulls me over and in a creepy, whispering tone goes\n\n\"Here's $5, but that's the rest of your tip down there. If you pull it out with your mouth you can have it.\"\n\nUh no thanks. There's people around everywhere and I think $20 is a bit too low for me to degrade myself publicly. Still got the $5 so whatever.\n\n   ",

        "text": "I'm a delivery driver for Domino's in Vancouver, BC. Finding a place to park is a huge pain in the neck because almost every block is filled with parked cars. One day, I was delivering to an apartment. As I arrive, I was scanning the side of the road for an empty spot. Eventually, I spot a taxi zone and I thought to myself \"I'll only be here for 3 mins.\" I pull over into the taxi zone and quickly ran into the building to make my delivery. 3 min later, as I was exiting the building, one person walking by shouted \"Quick before they tow your car.\" As I step on to the street, there was a bylaw enforcement officer walking away and I noticed there was a parking ticket on my windshield. I was fined for parking in a reserved area. Ticket was $60. Almost half my pay was gone that night. (This happened last month).\n\nToday I was on a delivery to the same neighbourhood mentioned above. This apartment was only one block from where I received my parking ticket. With nowhere to park, I turned on my hazards and parked in a \"No Stopping\" zone. The road only had one lane but wide enough for cars to pass each other. The delivery instructions said \"Buzzer broken, call on arrival.\" I call the guy and tell him to meet at the front entrance. While waiting for the guy, a police cruiser driving by looked at my car for a second then left. Both times I had my topper on.\n\nEDIT: Both times, I was parked on a city street. Just to clear up any confusion.",

Is there anything that you have used to keep your energy levels up that you'd recommend, preferably from experience? \n\nTL;DR I work late hours, and get bogged down after a while. What, if anything, have you used before to keep your energy levels up? \n\nAlso, yes, I know energy drinks exist. I'm looking for any other possibilities, or the most effective energy drink at least.

And, noticing the water coming from the sky, said \"Oh, sorry about that\". He then goes over to the spigot by the door and starts turning it clockwise, as if to turn the precipitation off. Now, turns out he had a sprinkler on earlier, and mistook the drizzle as his fault for half a second. But it was still pretty funny to watch a guy try to turn off the rain with his own personal  faucet.  \n\nHe may have been slightly drunk to be fair; when I handed him the receipt he put it in his pocket before realizing he was supposed to sign it.\n\nEdit: On second thought the receipt thing may be unfair, since he may have thought that it was just the customer copy.",

        "text": "I'm not a driver anymore, and I was only a driver for about 3 years, and really, I enjoyed it. But sometimes I really wonder why the fuck I ever became I driver because it never really suited me.\n\nShort but relevant background- I'm female, mid-twenties, so when I became a driver, and when this story took place I was early twenties. I live in a small city, and had worked at one of the big 3 at the time. I also tend to be a bit of a nervous wreck.\n\nSo, on to the story!\n\nI'd been delivering for probably a month or so. The manager had seen where I was going to and mentioned that the person I was delivering to was someone she knew (which admittedly made me nervous as I wasn't confident in my people skills. I was sure that if I messed up, the person would get back to my manager and rat me out. I had yet to figure out that my managers just didn't give a fuck). Anyway. I get there, I deliver the pizza, all is well in the world.\n\nI get to my car. It's locked. Sometimes when I get out I lock it out of habit by hitting the lock on the door. Okay, no biggy. Search for my keys. Not in my pockets. Starting to panic a bit. I look around the street a bit. Nothing. Okay, crap.\n\nAnd what's worse? Not only do I not have my keys, I left my phone in my car, too, and my windows are rolled up completely. It's middle of the night, and I'm a few miles away from the store and even further away from my house with the spare key.\n\nWell then. With no small amount of embarrassment, I trudge back up to the customer's porch, and scare the over loving shit out of her as she's about to open the screen door (to her, it looked like I popped out of nowhere). I explained the situation, and she lets me borrow her phone, so I call the store. The only solution they'll offer me is to call my emergency contact, my dad. He doesn't answer, so the store calls the customers phone back. They tell me and gives me my dad's number to try (because I don't know it). I try calling a few times, hoping he gets the idea that someone is, you know, trying to *reach him*, the problem is, he's near 60 and super paranoid about any number he doesn't know so he refuses to answer. \n\nFinally, the customer offers to give me a ride to my house to pick up the spare, which I take because hey, she's a friend of the manager, right? And the how the fuck else am I supposed to get back to the store because they're not helping.\n\nThankfully, my house isn't far away, and the spare is where I thought it was (Honestly I wasn't sure). We got back, got my car unlocked and I thanked her. We went on with our night and I went on to continue locking myself out of my car once every few months or so, but always made sure to have my phone on me.\n\nThere. My embarrassing story. I don't know what reminded me of it today but I thought I'd share.",
