        "text": "So, a little bit of background first.\n\nI'm currently employed as the sole security researcher at a relatively small MSSP/MSP/security consulting firm working in their SOC. I was promoted to this position roughly 7 months ago and was promoted from a security analyst position. I've been with my current employer about a year and a half and I have to say I've enjoyed most, if not all of it.\n\nHowever, I just got done with my monthly one-on-one check in with my boss and he gave me some feedback that kind of has me troubled (in a good way). See, he told me that he didn't feel like I was really engaging in my role as a researcher and that I was sort of squandering my potential by only focusing on being a good SOC security analyst and to be honest, I have to agree with him. I mean, since I was promoted I haven't really done much in the way of research. Sure, I've done some stuff here and there, but nothing really major. Probably the biggest things I've done so far are simply automating a portion of our C2 infrastructure and using PowerSploit to make getting a reverse shell setup a little bit easier and subsequently make our engagements more effective. But other than that, I really don't have much to show for myself as a security researcher. I certainly don't have certs either. I only have the Sec+ plus a handful of vendor specific certs. I guess it's just hard for me to get out of that security analyst mindset and get into the mindset of a researcher. Part of it though I think has to do with not being given the opportunities to grow as a researcher, not being give the opportunities to work on the really interesting stuff like malware analysis and reverse engineering.\n\nAnyway, do you guys have any advice for becoming a better security researcher? In terms of things I'm already doing, I just recently within the last day or so setup a lab for re-learning pentesting with the help of Georgia Weidman's Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking. I'm also being more active on my blog/website and am trying to keep it up to date with my various side projects, even if they aren't directly related to my role as a researcher. So, I'm preferably looking for advice on things that I can do to show my worth as a security researcher. Doesn't even have to be a project, could just be something simple like a behavioral change. IMy boss has already given me some advice and he said I could really improve just by communicating more about what I'm doing or working on, basically becoming more engaged in my work as a researcher.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I believe that the problem code is on the lines where welcome is concatenated with the username and newline character, and that I should be able to overflow welcome somehow, as strcat does not check buffer sizes. However, I'm struggling to actually do that. As far as I can tell, strncpy is used correctly on both username and password and the null character added correctly. As such, both username and password are correctly truncated at 19 characters and strcat works correctly.\n\nCould anyone give me a few hints/pointers as to what I'm missing out on?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated and thanks very much in advance!",

Whats the limit? - Any other suggestions?",

        "text": "Hey everyone! So you might remember me, but I posted about my first OSCP exam about 8 months ago. Since then, I have failed the OSCP 5 times. 3 of those times I live-tweeted as I went. On all my attempts I have made between 50-65 points, and put up a good fight! My next attempt, #6, is on 4/20 in 6 weeks.\n\nI wanted to post here after running into another PWK student who was also now gearing up for their 6th attempt, to kinda give my perspective. I have been \"hacking\" since I was a kid, doing CTFs and writing/modifying exploits. In that time, I have learned a lot of habits and have developed dependencies that really, REALLY hurt on the OSCP. The exam is specially crafted to try and put you into a mindset that, up to now, I've hardly even tried. I miss Metasploit, and Burp Pro, and Empire, and all my various vulnerability scanners and tools. I miss my dumb cheesy custom scripts and SQLMap and all the good stuff I've made into my usual daily diet. It's exhausting going from my day job where I can use these things, to an exam environment where I can't.\n\nRegardless, OSCP has been amazing. I've learned more about myself than about Infosec, and feel it is teaching me to be flexible (something I SUCK at). I want everyone trying the exam out, and failing, to know that it doesn't mean you won't thrive in the infosec world. It just means you need to grow more, and learn more, and become BETTER. A certification does not a hacker make, nor does it tear down what being a \"hacker\" means in someone who is one.\n\nI got &gt;30 machines in the labs manually, low priv on others. I've done vulnhubs and Hack the Box and read blog after blog, and continue to fail. And that's ok. Every attempt shows me another weakness in myself and my techniques to improve. Plus, I now have around 18 unique exam machines under my belt. Eventually, they'll run out of new ones to give me :)\n\nDon't give up. Try Harder, Try SMARTER. If I have to take this exam 20 times, I know it will be better for me in the long run to learn how to work under pressure, in limited circumstances, and not in the CTF world of cheese. Good luck guys! And, wish me luck too... I am gettin' a bit sleepy here!",

I'm graduating college with a BS in a field I have no interest/ability to pursue. I've been doing extensive research in several fields, but more towards IT, namely infosec. I've probably romanticized the field because of pop culture and have no idea what it fully entails. The community seems amazing, job outlook is great, and it's a cool techy job! Not just a job, a career! A career in which I won't be limited by physical restraints (health stuff etc etc)! I really, really enjoy the idea of having a craft I can take home and improve upon and sharing that with a community. From what I've pieced together, the best way to approach this career is to: \n\n1) Get some certs and find an entry level help desk job OR computer repair tech job(comptia A+, network, security)\n\n2) build a computer from parts to booting\n\n3) learn a language (python or powershell) and learn how to script\n\n4) contribute to open source projects/make a git hub/ make a blog\n\n5) Network (go to meet ups, b sides, and conferences) \n\n6) Join a couple of CTFs (and see if I know anything about anything)\n\n7) Start applying for entry level positions?\n\nI'm a total novice in anything computer related. Does this sound like a good path? I'm residing in California, so I'm concerned that my unrelated BS would disqualify me because of the competition that comes from living in a major city. There's an online post bach two year comp sci program which runs 20,000 USD, but the price is steep and it is out of state (CA does not do post bachs *often) and I would not get a chance to network with peers/meet recruiters.\n\nThank you for your time!",

This was hard enough, as a problem with many of those phones is they go into a boot loop. Luckily, thanks to a modified boot image, I was able to keep mine working. However, flashing SuperSu and NetHunter was difficult as the custom recovery which I had installed (TWRP) was not modified. And would sometimes crash. Anyway, I got it working in the end. Using an app called FlashFire to install NetHunter once SuperSu was working.\n\nI should really just get to my question.\n\nOn the Pwnie Express Community Editions web page, there is a download of the Android Open Pwn Project \"bullhead\" image. Has anyone successfully tested this on a Nexus 5x? Is it suited for it? Because mine needed a modified boot image, will this go into a boot loop? And lastly, how do I flash it (as TWRP crashes a lot of the time and I don't want to erase my hard work)?\n\nThank you.",

Thinking about security, and the fishing e-mails to which elderly and other vulnerable people typically fall prey. Instead of teaching them to type the address into the address bar, could they ensure they are on their bank's landing site by inputting the IP address?\n\nEven if they were on a compromised machine with some kind of redirect malware, would that be diverted by confirming IP instead of domain name? \n\nI know that doesn't ensure private communication with the bank, that's a broader question I'm not asking.  I'm just wondering what I don't understand, because if it's as simple as it seems, then that would have been a widespread solution introduced in the 90s.\n\nWhat am I missing?  \n\n\nUPDATE: It would have worked to use IP addresses, but because they were never employed as a security measure, IPs are not static like phone numbers, and trust certificates need not include an IP, only a url.\n\n\n**TL:DR**  It could have worked, and was a terrible missed opportunity for elderly banking customers who commonly fell prey to fishing emails and popups.",

However, when I install symantec and kaspersky to computers, non of them are possible. First, they do not allow you to call powershell. I excluded my stager from scanning engines so I was able to get my first agent. However, these products also prevents VMI executions so laterally spreading was not possible. As far as I know, symantec and kaspersky are popular products for enterprises. So, what red teams are doing in this situation? Are they asking whitelisting from the customer during test or something else?\n\nMy second question: I heard that core impact is a very successful post-exploitation product. Does core impact has ability to bypass products like symantec and kaspersky or does it still need whitelisting? ",
