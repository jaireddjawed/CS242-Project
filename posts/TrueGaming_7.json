        "text": " \n\nOkay, let's think about this for a second.\n\nDevelopment costs are up. Pokemon Violet had issues because of low quality staff. If we pay more money then Gamefreak will improve the game by quite a bit, and when you think about it, the game is already a fantastic value. Like 400 pokemon? That's amazing. The original only had 150! That's over a 200% increase in value alone!\n\n70 dollars is actually quite cheap for a videogame these days, when you start to factor in other costs like additional game passes and cosmetics, 70 dollars is actually a bargain! Most other games would charge an arm and a leg just to unlock pokemon. You would have to pay 5 dollars per pokemon, and at 400 pokemon that's $2,000! What a steal!\n\nOriginal N64 games were 60 dollars, so we've been riding the gravy train for far too long and need to pay our fair share. Now that I think about it, games could be 80 or 90 dollars and still be a fair value. Heck,even 100 dollars is a fantastic value if you include all the pokemon from both versions.\n\nPeople will say 100 dollars is a lot of dough, but actually not really! Avatar 2 was 20 dollars for 3 hours of entertainment and considering you're getting hundreds of action packed hours of gameplay, it's almost criminal to be paying the hardworking developers such a meager sum of money.\n\nThe developers deserve a raise, and the fans need to start carrying their own weight.\n\nLet's do the right thing, and start paying what Pokemon is really worth.",

        "text": "I love strategy games and have played them since the 90s. Starting with AoE2 I've played many games including other classic RTS like Aoe1, 3 and 4, AoM, Empire at War, Battle for Middleearth and Cossacks. But also city and castle builders like Anno and Stronghold. Not to mention Total war games and, more recently, especially Paradox games.\n\nOut of these types of games, Paradox Grand Strategy games seem the most complex to me. They have many different interrelated systems, many in depth mechanics and the barrier of entry is quite high. \n\nIn contrast, a game like Aoe2 seems fairly basic: most people can probably learn the fundamentals and beat the medium AI quickly. The systems are relatively simple and there is usually no trade off or limiting factor: for example, economically, you just want more of everything asap (villagers, technologies boosting gather rates etc). The only concern is balancing everything over time, but that mostly applies to multiplayer (eg not overbooming, making enough military). Ultimately, all the complexity in AoE comes from the Real Time and Competitive factors: you have to perfect every little thing, even though the basics are obvious. \n\nAnd yet in discussions people sometimes tell me it is a very deep or complicated game. So moving away from these examples I am wondering: How do you generally measure a strategy game's complexity and depth? How do they relate to each other and to the difficulty of learning a game?",

For example all of frost punk can be played with a \"greater good\" mentality and you'd never necessarily feel evil, but some of the stuff you do with that mentality does seem pretty screwed up.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, there's quarantine circular, that doesn't provide necessarily evil and good options, but you always get a gut feeling of which is which, before you more carefully consider the implications. This game's choices don't affect much of anything, apart from the exploration of the direct consequences, leaving you to pick what you genuinely think is right.\nShould all moral games strive to this design?\n\nSo with all this in mind, should the evil option, or any moral choices provide tangible gameplay benefits with no drawbacks? What about with story drawbacks? But then what about the people that optimize the fun out of a game, they'll always choose the evil option with no matter what. Can you do anything to provide any choice without people optimising it?",

FPS games lend themselves well to highlights because doing something impressive seems relatively straight-forward (sometimes) like a guy walking into a room and killing 4 people stylishly, it just kind of seems obvious how to craft the highlight.\n\nWe have some members in the group that play fighting games but our editors aren't as experienced making content from fighting games.\n\nOur question is what is a good thought process for making fighting game highlights?\n\nHave you consumed fighting game highlights before?\n\nif so what stood out to you?\n\nAre there some key things to look out for?\n\nAre there good examples you have seen that worked really well?\n\nWhat is it about some genres that makes them better suited to highlights as opposed to others like fighting games and RTS?\n\nI know it will obviously depend on the game and all that but just looking for some general insight.\n\nThis would be a big help for us so thank you in advance.",

        "text": "I see posts about skill based matchmaking mostly in reference to call of duty and a subset of players that want to be able to own noobs and not be forced to play people of their skill level. That's not what this post is about.\n\nWhile it's absolutely the case that some games are improved by SBMM; Dota, counter strike, chess, fighting games etc. There are also games that where the player experience is changed for the worse when SBMM is added. The main categories of online games where the addition of skill based matchmaking would cause a reduction in game play experience in my view, are elimination based games. These are games such as the auto battlers Super Auto Pets and Team-fight tactics, and any battle royal game like pubg or apex legends. \n\nOne reason for this is because in elimination games, the difficulty scales based on how far into the game you get. The early game is easier than the late game because at the end of the game you are only fighting those who haven't been eliminated. There is also inherent variance, which leads to some games ending quickly and others going to the end game. \n\nWhen I played pubg for the first time, I didn't win a game for about a month. And why would I? There were 100 other people in the game. There was no expectation that I should win a match. And not winning was not causing me any problems because winning wasn't my goal when I entered a game, getting as far as I could was. So you can imagine how much my heart was pounding when I had crawled my way into a final circle after my buddies died and then I stood up and killed the 2 remaining members of the final squad. It was incredible, and that moment couldn't have happened if I had been playing against a lobby of other people who had never won a match for that whole month. \n\nI play a lot of Super Auto Pets. It's a auto battler where (in arena mode, the main mode) for each battle you are matched against a team that other people have played recently. These are not actually other players playing at the same time you are. You fight random teams of the same round until you run out of hp or get 10 wins. This game has no SBMM and in my opinion it wouldn't benefit from it. It could easily choose to match me against teams that I will beat every time, and the game would become meaningless. Similarly if it chose teams I would lose to, that also removes the meaning from the game. The point is that I'm beating random teams. I have to be better than the average player (and or get lucky) that day to win. \n\nI don't want to get too broad with the scope of this discussion, but if you are someone who believes the difficulty of games such as elden ring and sekiro changes the way the community works, then you might see a connection here. Everyone who played pubg was playing the **same** game. A win was a win, and it was hard to come by. Everyone who plays Super Auto Pets plays against the same average team quality when they queue, so everyone is able to engage in the discussion on the same level. \n\nIf you compare to dota. Whenever someone makes a post on truedota2, saying \"I think faceless void is op this patch\" the first comment is. \"What mmr are you playing at?\" because unless they know the poster is close to their mmr, their experience with a hero means little for their games. Dota requires SBMM but for games that don't require it, why split the player-base needlessly?\n\nA win is never guaranteed in a game like this. You go in with a 1 in 10 or 1 in 100 chance of winning each time. I believe everyone playing the same difficulty in a game like this creates a community that can all talk together because they are playing in the same lobbies, seeing the same strategies, and working just as hard for their wins. SBMM isn't required like it is in dota or counter strike because you don't need to win to play. I played pubg every day for a month and didn't win and I had a great time. I won battles, I just never took the chicken dinner. I similarly had to take a week or so learning Super Auto Pets before I got a 10 piece.\n\nYou may disagree for a few reasons. Maybe you think that new players should have a chance to win, I think that's a reasonable opinion and there's room for some games to be like that and others to be like pubg was when it launched. I think what bothers me is the reductive discussion around SBMM that says that it's absolutely a benefit to new players to not play with the good players. I fundamentally disagree that that's true for all or even the large majority of players, and I think it re-contextualizes all wins as conditional. Yes you won, but in bronze so don't feel too proud or anything. Your first win is dampened, and then each following win is harder until you can't win anymore. Where is the feeling of progress there? It's not like a game with 2 even sides where you would expect to win half your games. \n\nI can definitely see why some elimination based games would benefit from a ranked mode, but I don't think there is no benefit to a random pool style matchmaking for these games. \n\nI'd love to hear others thoughts on this. Especially those who still play battle royal games as I haven't since early apex and then a bit more apex a year later.",

It feels like a chore to move, it's so frustrating there are mobile that have more fluid movement than this game. That's a game killer for me if the movement is clunky and I get frustrated moving in the game, with that DAMN horse ( god he's so BAD to move around) than I ain't enjoying the game.\n\nNow some may say you play this game for the story and the cutscenes. Lol go watch a movie then. This is first and foremost a videogame the gameplay should be the main focus and the rest is extra.\n\nCombat was ok I guess (repetitive) .\n\nUI is horrendous.\n\nSo much hype for a nothing sandwich",

        "text": "*Running is the fun*\n\nThat's what I kept telling myself throughout my playthrough of Heart Machine’s *Solar Ash*. I have been a huge fan of their work since *Hyper Light Drifter* and I looked forward to their next project. Life happened and I finally managed to get through a playthrough during the Steam Winter Sale. I almost 100%’d the game in what took me 7 hours of play. At the end of it, I cannot help but feel empty about it and not in a good way. \n\nFirst, I’ll get the positives out of the way. The game is a visual masterpiece and every screenshot is wallpaper worthy. I have a whole album of them. It is very reminiscent of Breath of the Wild, but with a more neon flavor. The game also ran spectacularly well, they went with Unreal this time rather than Gamemaker. I also really enjoyed the structure of the game. The game’s central hub is like Hyrule Field from *Ocarina of Time*, but it’s a field of clouds. This hub connects the other sections of the game which are themed differently. The music by Disasterpiece is again amazing and I will be listening to it regularly.The best thing about Solar Ash is the movement. Gliding across the clouds of the planet was the funnest part. Getting on all platforms in one go or getting a great boost jump was *very fun*. I will not spoil the boss fights, but the bosses make the game shine. They fully realize the concepts of *Solar Ash*.\n\n\nNow to the problems. \n\nWhile the movement is fun, there is a lack of player expression. There is only the option to dash and boost. You can boost jump, but that depends a lot on the terrain you are on. I felt really limited at times during some sections of the game and wished that they took their concept further. I kept thinking about how Mario was the long jump or wall jump. I wish I could have seen something similar. The game’s “puzzles” are platforming gauntlets that have to be done in a certain amount of time. They can be fun, but I was left frustrated because 99% of them are so easy that they were done in one single try. There’s no sense of challenge here. There are enemies but all of them die in around 4 hits and only serve to hinder the player during these gauntlets. They feel like fluff in a game that’s already super short. \n\nThe story of the game is one big metaphor for dealing with trauma. I have nothing against that, but the way it was presented was ineffective. The game lore dumps you constantly and it isn’t interesting at all. The environmental storytelling is there and it’s great however. The voice acting in this game was not needed at all and really breaks the pace of the game. I try to skip the lines I have already read and there is this glitch where you hear two pieces of dialogue at once causing them to overlap. Most frustrating, were the audio logs you can find. These provide a lot of context on what's happening, but it forces you to listen to them standing still. Why couldn’t I glide across the world while listening to it? The voice acting in this game can range from average to poor. Characters stand still while talking but the actual dialogue spoken is overacted. \n\nHeart Machine did something special with *Hyper Light Drifter* . It was a game that that encouraged exploration and determination because that game was *difficult*. And I am not saying that difficulty is all that matters, but it plays a big part of it. I never felt like I was becoming better at playing *Solar Ash*. I always felt like I was going through the motions and exploring the world. The only time I felt excited was during the boss fights. I got this on sale, but I cannot fathom paying 40 dollars for this game because this game lacks depth and content. I do not come into games with expectations. But I really did feel surprised throughout my playthrough. Did anyone else have a similar experience?\n\n\nTl;dr: Game is good but half baked. Only buy during a sale.",

So a random crackhead with a baseball bat might be stronger than a heavily armed police officer. \n\nNot only is this unrealistic and illogical but it also effects gameplay in other ways. You can't determine the strength of an enemy just by looking at them an enemy that looks weak could actually be strong because there is a number 20 floating by their head \n\nThe real question is: why does it need to be like that? The game has a perfect setting to include enemies of wildly different strengths that actually make sense. Stronger enemies could have better weapons, better armour, better augmentations. Wouldn't that make more sense?",

Please take a look!\n\n*Yuma Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\\_Will\\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)\n\nAs a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and complex moral/narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.\n\nI encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above.

        "text": "I'm really getting tired of hearing the common narrative that devs are being forced to put their games on last gen and are not able to take full advantage of PS5 and XSX. The easiest counter to this claim is to look at the best looking games out--all of them run on a ps4. The Last of Us pt. II, RDR2, God of War Ragnarok. All of these games run on a base PS4, and well, and they are arguably the best and most realistic looking games out there. This isn't because of graphical power or whatever the fuck, it's because they are made by the best developers. You think if Ubisoft shit out the next Assassin's Creed game onto PS5 only then it would suddenly look better? \n\nMaybe this has been said many times before, and I welcome any examples that disprove what I'm saying. IDK I just think that the expectation for fidelity and good graphics and \"next gen\" experiences is misplaced. If Rockstar can make RDR2 look as good as it does on PS4 then saying that a game being released on previous gen is being \"held back\" just isn't valid.",

        "text": "Driving in Cyberpunk is simply just awful. Honestly, I'm downright shocked that a game which had one of the biggest budgets in gamming has driving this bad. Where did that budget go? Paying for Keanu Reeves? What's the point of having Keanu Reeves in your open world game when you can't even get around the open world because the driving is so bad. I get that this is the first time CD Project Red have included cars in a game but surely they could have gotten help from some of the best racing game devs. I mean did they even ask? Did they just decide to build their car mechanics from the ground up? Whatever they did, the result is a complete catastrophe. The driving is ten times worse than games that are more than a decade old. \n\nHere's a list of what I hate about the driving in Cyberpunk:\n\n* The vehicle sounds are terrible. Most of the cars sound the same and that sound is painful to hear. Its the most bland generic monotone diesel generator sound that you can probably find on a site for free sound effects. Shameful. \n* The handling. What the hell went wrong with the handling? I feel like I'm driving on ice. There's no grip whatsoever. Every time I try to make a turn, the rear of the car gives and I end up spinning. That is unless you take the corner super slowly. And it takes forever for the car to stop after breaking. Just feels like driving on ice. \n* The car damage model is worse than PS2 games. You can be driving at full speed and crash head on into a concrete wall and the only thing that will happen is your front bumper falling off. There's very minimal visible damage to cars. You can tell barely any development time was put into this. But in a modern game this is unacceptable. Especially since PS2 games like Vice City have more visible car damage than Cyberpunk. \n* The cars just feel like they don't have any weight to them. When you hit a small rock while driving, the whole car starts flipping over multiple times. It's funny the first few times but gets very annoying later on when you're just trying to get to your next mission. \n\nI could go on but I'll stop here. CD Project Red should be ashamed of themselves. They've built cars that look nice but are multiple generations behind in terms of gameplay. Furthermore Night City is not a fun city to drive in, too many long stretches of road followed by sharp 90 degree turns. They clearly didn't test their city design to see if driving around it would be fun. For a game where cars and driving play such a huge role, it's a shame such little effort was put into it.",

Discovering Amnesia in 2012 (and by extension also discovering my first survival horror game that had first person view) was like discovering a game that I had been waiting all my life to play. First person view is more immersive. Not being able to fight back is scarier. I’ve never understood how a third person view can be scary, which is what Silent Hill seemed to use. Did lighting technology need to catch up to the visions that developers Red Barrels (Outlast) and Frictional Games (Amnesia) had ? Was it not possible to develop Outlast and Amnesia before 2010?\n\nLastly, and yes I’ve been living under a rock and yes I know there’s “better” graphics out there, Outlast has my favorite graphics and “feel” of all time. I love the way you can see your own body when you look down. I love how picking up objects and opening doors is animated. I love how your hands show up when crouching or walking up against a wall. I love the way the character moves throughout the environment. The feel. The immersion. I so wish more games had the same “feel” and “look” as Outlast. Where are these games? Are there mods of Outlast out there? I find myself thinking up of new creepy environments and backstories using the Outlast “engine” all the time. I honestly also would love to play a open world game with no enemies where all I do is walk around and explore (but this game HAS to have Outlast caliber first person interface and graphics).

Somehow, a like 13 year old Yasha was able to play these games with their ASCII art and even find a great deal of charm and aesthetic appeal to their ascetic, stripped-down art. In my experience, tilesets which try to backport graphics into these games always look significantly worse than the ASCII because they are incredibly busy and devoid of animation (because the games don't support animation) which just looks even more artificial and fake. I love great spritework in games, from the extremely well-drawn sprites of Blazblue, Street Fighter 3, and other fighting games, to the lavish animations of something like Metal Slug or Freedom Planet 2, but sptires *need* animation or they just look silly frankly.\n\nThese games also frankly would not be what they are without ASCII. The sheer amount of content in NETHack or Dwarf Fortress would be impossible for their small devteams (in the later case ONE person) to create assets for if they had detailed art. [Look at how many creatures there are in DF. This is an infeasible amount of unique sprites to create (as shown by the Steam release taking like 4 years to come out with an entire team who did nothing but crank art out (and make the UI worse than before but I don't have time to talk about how keyboard-driven UIs are vastly superior to tortuously elaborated mouse-driven UIs)](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Creature)\n\nDwarf Fortress is now on Steam with an official tileset and I am actually going to go joker mode over people now falling over themselves to praise it for \"finally having graphics!\" when it ALWAYS had graphics, and quite pleasing ones at that.

        "author": "Enraric",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10379hz/character_builds_as_roleplaying_vs_character/",
        "text": "Lately I've been thinking about the ways different RPGs approach the idea of character building, and the purpose of character building in different games. I've realized that there are two different functions that character building can serve in RPGs - character builds as roleplaying, and character builds as challenge.\n\nWhen character building is an aspect of roleplaying, the game is designed to accomodate a broad diversity of character builds. Building your character is less about trying to find the strongest possible build and more about expressing the identity of your character or your identity as a player. Objectives can often be completed in a variety of ways, depending on a character's strengths and weaknesses. Some builds may be better in certain scenarios than others, but ultimately all builds are meant to be capable of completing quests and finishing the game. \n\nWhen character building is an aspect of challenge, all builds are not meant to be equally viable. Your build isn't an expression of your character's identity; building your character is about making them as strong as you can. It's possible to make \"wrong\" build choices that make the game unequivocally harder across the board, in all situations. When faced with a tough challenge, you are not supposed to figure out how to overcome the challenge with the build that you have; you're supposed to go back to the drawing board and revise your build (assuming build revision is possible).\n\nI've outlined these two functions of character building in RPGs as if they were discrete positions, but in reality they are the ends of a spectrum. All RPGs lie somewhere between these two absolutes. Even when developers intend for builds to be an aspect of role playing, some options will be better than others, as no game can be perfectly balanced. Your character's build in Skyrim is meant to be an expression of their identity, but it's hard to deny that stealth archery is the most effective approach in most scenarios. And even when developers intend for builds to be an aspect of challenge, there is usually a spectrum of strong build options that the player can choose between based on what appeals to them. Part of the challenge of the SMT and Persona games is building a strong team of demons (it's possible to build your team \"wrong\" and end up with a completely gimped team), but there is a long list of demons and many ways to build a strong team. And there are RPGs which lie closer to the center of the spectrum, where certain aspects of your build are expressions of character identity and certain aspects are meant to be changed to suit the challenge at hand. In Elden Ring, weapon investments are permanent and you have a limited number of stat respecs, but you can easily swap around your weapon infusions and physick tears to suit the challenge at hand (e.g. infusing your weapon with fire and using the physick tear that boosts fire damage when facing a boss that is weak to fire damage).\n\nThinking about different approaches to character building this way has helped me understand why I like the RPG systems in some games more than others. My natural inclination is towards character building as an aspect of roleplaying, and I have a hard time adjusting to games that make character building an aspect of challenge. When I first played vanilla Persona 5, I said to my friends \"I wish I could just pick personas I like and stick with them, like in Pokemon.\" Though I didn't understand it at the time, I was expressing my preference for character builds as roleplaying. The persona fusion system in Persona isn't objectively bad, but it's not an approach to character building that I like or that I naturally jive with. Thinking about RPG systems in terms of roleplaying vs challenge has helped me understand and explain why I like certain RPG systems more than others.",

This is a super long time for a game to be made, so it’s no surprise that we don’t get many high quality, AAA games. What do I mean by “high quality”? Basically, a game that is masterfully crafted, feature complete, and has an adequate level of polish. \n\nMost games I see coming from the mainstream industry are lazily produced, copy and paste, iterative sequels that rehash the same structure from before. These are the games we typically wait a couple years for. These are your Assassins Creeds, your Call of Dutys, Battlefields etc. \n\nBut the High Quality games that go bold and don’t rehash a bunch of stuff take like 6 years minimum to come out. These are super ambitious sequels and brand new IPs. \n\nSo I gotta ask the industry “why the hell does this stuff take so long now?” It seemed like 10-15 years ago we were getting industry defining sequels and daring, innovative new IPs on a bi-yearly basis. \n\nHasn’t the technology for making games only gotten more efficient and fast than it’s ever been before? Dont we have some of the most amazing software and toolkits available that would embarrass those of a decade ago? And why is the development time need to make something other than a lazy, buggy rehash perpetually increasing in length?\n\nI would’ve thought the efficiency of our tech that we use to make games scaled with the complexity of games we create, resulting in dev time not increasing very much. At this point I have to think that games have gotten harder to make but our tools haven’t gotten any easier of faster to use. Because what else would explain this?",

This time the criticisms aren’t coming from the usual white bigoted crowd, its coming from an audience of Asian-descent (diaspora or not) English speakers, a lot of whom are outside the US. It becomes very clear to the Danmei crowd, how the rhetoric is very pro-watering down and erasure of other people’s culture, how it is very white and very America-centric (what about the English speakers outside the US?), how it treads on xenophobic talking points. The prof JP localizer isn’t too keen on footnotes, but the Danmei audience accepts such, and points out how such footnotes are commonplace be it in ENG fantasy novels, or in translation of novels from other languages. They see the insensitivity to such talking points.\n\nWhy did this Prof JP localizer join the convo anyway? Because the person’s mutuals didn’t like the localization style of the preview of the work done translator as hired by the publisher of the then about to be published Danmei novel.

To the critics, it all looks like what it is, white people whitesplaining to a Chinese person. https://twitter.com/theflotilla/status/1445271808337403904?t=i9KtSnzHq6Mc8oOU5x7roQ&amp;s=19\n\nWhat has come after this? Seems like the localizer has decided that the very Asian very non-white Danmei crowd is toxic and crazy and rabid, and their mutuals still thinks that the translation done is trash. To the Danmei crowd well, the translated Danmei novel became an NYT best-seller. https://twitter.com/theflotilla/status/1497816783557963778?t=Wq3UShoLKpk-N9y6esV_Ug&amp;s=19\n\nWhat does it all say? American English people have gotten used to the very flattened way of consuming JP media. JP media has been assimilated as something that can be consumed by the white audience in a way that caters to them, without much need to expand cultural horizons. Foreign items and words are too distracting, very “keikaku means plan”stuff, therefore it must be converted to American equivalents, so as to equalize how a native JP consumer would consume the original JP work. Maybe spice it up here or there, to cater American tastes. But the thing is, JP and US culture has many differences, and not every JP cultural thing has a handy US equivalent. There can never be a perfect “American” equivalent. And what is there to say on the dismissal of the original author’s intent in favor of the tastes of Americans?\n\nIt’s all very US-centric really, but the Danmei situation show how insular the American JP to EN localization scene has become. Not to say that such lengths to erase foreign culture is non-existent in other types of localizations in other territories, but it seems like the US JP localization scene has established this type of, culturally erasing standard as the “best” way a localization is done.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/102uz5h/are_games_that_incorporate_multiple_playstyles/",
        "text": "# Are games that incorporate multiple playstyles (the right way) inherently better than one-note games? \n\n*^(Disclaimer: I say \"the right way\" because not all games execute multiple playstyles correctly. Some games fail at making all playstyles balanced, which can be to the argumental advantage of one-note linear games. However for this discussion I'm really only talking about games that do both open-gameplay and linear-gameplay)* ***^(correctly)****^(, in order to focus the conversation towards the objective technical definition of a good game. This isn't Red Dead 2 vs Fruit Ninja or whatever negative example someone might want to mention.)*\n\nI was looking at the Steam awards' results today. I don't want my point to seem like I simply dislike any of the games that won this year\\* but while I can recognize the games' beauty, I can't help but wonder why there wasn't a single winning game that literally focused on depth. And I **literally** mean literally.  \n\n\nFirstly, I'm surprised that so many AAA games won the *Steam* game awards in the first place, but I guess my favorite games aren't as popular as I thought, y'know? I've definitely been a little too under a rock to really keep up with the newest games from the past year, but these results alone make me ask: Are we beginning to run out of benchmark games in the AAA industry? I feel like I can only rely on Rockstar and Bethesda to repeat themselves when they take their time to release something so innovative that we get more games trying to be like it for the rest of time. I would mention Nintendo but Steam and Nintendo are barely a thing.   \n\n\nSecondly, **I DO NOT MEAN TO DISS ANY OF THE GAMES THAT WON** but I think it's easy to reach a consensus that most of these games are objectively what should be defined as \"one-note\". The Last Of Us is relatively a very one-note game and it's one of my favorite games of all time. Let me exemplify what one-note games are...  \n\n\nLook at some of the winning games that can be summed up with one note just from the title. What's Hitman about? You practice the job of a Hitman. What's Spider-man about? You do Spiderman things. Everyone knows what Spiderman things are. What happens in God of War? You fight as the God of War. I don't really need to fill in many blanks to describe the *main gameplay*, right? You do hits as a man, you play as Spiderman, and you participate in war with gods. These games may all have fantastic stories but having a lot of story is not the same as having a lot of playstyles.   \n\n\nThese are one-note games. Especially when compared to -- I'mma be *that* fanatic for five seconds -- Games like Fallout New Vegas. The main character can be a jazzy smooth-talking scientist but that's not the ONLY thing he could ever be. It's always up to the player. That entire series actually marries \"linear story-based aesthetically-fun gameplay\" with \"unpredictable emergent functionally-fun gameplay\" almost perfectly. Almost.  \n\n\nWhat do you do in Rimworld? You can choose to begin as a lone survivor stranded rummaging on a treacherous lost and empty island, only finding scraps that you need to make last through each Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter. YOU CAN ALSO BE a cult-like society of 200 hedonistic nudist psychopaths who worship weed and sex but also have their own educational system and royal government that trades with other developed civilizations all over a giant explorable planet. You can choose most of any possibilities between those two choice and beyond. It's not a one-note game.  \n\n\nWhat do you do in Streets of Rogue? It takes place in a city where YOU CAN BE ANYTHING from a zombie or stand-up comedian, to a cop or doctor, to a gorilla or an alien, or a vampire, or a hobo! Bartender, mobster, crip, celebrity's bodyguard with his own wage. Plus the game chooses to allow you to experience the story itself, rather than tell a story to you. You can see how this game allows the player to be more than just *one* thing, right? You can even be all of those characters at once, if you want to cheat. It's the best rogue-lite of the past decade imo because it's the only one where you don't just endlessly empty out rooms of hostile NPCs. It's not a one-note game.  \n\n\nOf the three AAA award-winning contemporary video games, how many of them have cheats or cheat codes *just as another option for gameplay*? Y'know what I mean? Forget I even brought cheat codes up. Not even indie games really care about cheats as much as mods these days.  \n\n\nI'm sure I could have fun with any of the winning games\\*, but only for so long until it turns from an unpredictable game to something I've already done before, head to toe. And if we can dive out of the Steam room for just a sec, it's relevant to mention that the zeitgeist of the general videogame fanbase seems to prefer games specifically such as Apex, Fortnite, Far Cry/Dying Light/Assassin's Creed/Battlefield, Spider-man, Hit-man, Pac-man, Call of Duty 17: Army Man... These are all *technically* very one-note games compared to games with as many notes as an hour-long symphony. I blame capitalism for the success of all the games I just listed.   \n\n\nI know both styles of games are fun in their own right. Sometimes you just want to play a linear game, maybe even episodically. I know. I'm just curious as to what you would say is closer to the perfect video game: Linear-story games or open-story games?  Because to me I would say the more options you have in a video game, the better. You never hear people say Smash is the greatest game of all time unless that's the only game they play lol. But I guess nuance could explain that even a seemingly-simple game like that has many different playstyles due to the vast character selection.  \n\n\n# TL;DR\n\nPersonally, I think games like Skyrim and Minecraft are inherently even better than games such as Elden Ring where technically the only activity you're encouraged to do is kill most of everything you see. In my opinion, the perfect game allows you to do *literally absolutely anything* you want. But I enjoy both types of games! I just want to hear other people's agreements or disagreements with me.   \n\n\nLike, I'm not gonna change my mind on what makes the best video game but I'll definitely hear other perspectives and take them into account when I endlessly search through Steam sales for that one perfect game.  \n\n\n^(\\*i'll admit I'm very salty about Cyberpunk's winning category. The Labor of Love award? That game promised one of the most freedom-based game mechanics, then released a buggy mess, and then fixed only most of the super-obvious bugs to distract us from the fact that they never fixed any of the promises. That's the opposite of loving labor. In terms of player-choice, Cyberpunk is the antithesis of it's company's previous game, The Witcher 3. In my very personal opinion, Cyberpunk 2077 should've won the \"biggest disappointment since No Man's Sky\" category. Fuck that game, fuck it's cliche story and fuck it's shitty law pursuit system. I hate money. /rant)",

        "text": "So I have a mostly arbitrary nit picky question that I'm curious about. Video game generations are technically defined by the introduction of new hardware but in conversation the games that come out on that hardware are also classified as part of that generation. \n\nGeneration gaps are usually pretty simple because big console manufacturers have released their products within a year or 2 of each other. Nintendo threw a big wrench in that by starting the 8th generation with the Wii U and then releasing another console with the Switch over 3.5 years before their competitors were ready to put out another console. This puts the Switch in a weird middle zone where it has the hardware of an 8th gen console or weaker, but is still competing with 9th gen consoles multiple years into the generation. \n\nWhen we look back at the best games of the 8th and 9th generations how do you think these Switch games, specifically the ones that have come out from 2021 onwards, should/will be classified? This question probably isn't relevant right now but if Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gets even close to the quality of BOTW I think it will be a question for years if it should be on a best of 8th gen or best of 9th gen list.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/102sldn/fixing_god_of_war_ragnarok/",
        "text": " \n\nI will start with outlining that factors that built into my hype for this game.\n\nMY KNOWLEDGE OF RAGNAROK IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY:\n\nIn Norse mythos, Ragnarok is a great battle that sees the death of Odin, Thor, Tyr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki. Its name means \"The Twlight/Destruction of the Gods.\" After an exceptionally long winter, many long imprisoned beasts and gods break free. It is stated in the Poetic Edda that \"the life blood of fated men will be sated upon, homes will be painted red, the sun will turn black, all weathers will turn treachorous. Brothers will fight and kill each other, sisters will defile kinship, no man will have mercy.\"\n\nThree gigantic beautiful roosters respectively warn the Dead, the Giants, and the Gods that Ragnarok has begun. Due to prophecy, everyone knew this day would come. Heimdall blows his horn and the battle is on. Everyone heads to the fated location of Ragnarok...\n\nOdin rides his might horse Sleipnir with an eagle helmit and his mighty spear Gungnir in his hand and will lead the enormous army of Asgard along with all the Gods and the brave einherjar to the battlegrounds of the Vígríðr plains, which are an immense hundred leagues in each direction.\n\nYggdrasil shudders and groans as the Jotunn come from the east, led by the mighty Jotunn Hrym and his legion of Frost Giants. Loki, at this time, was imprisoned in Hel for killing Baldr, and has had painful venom dripping on his head day in and day out, causing him such pain that his convulsions and ange cause earthquakes. When the horn is blown, he is so angry that he finally manages to break free. He arrives at the battleground too, and joins on the side of the giants against the Aesir, leading an army of all of Hel's dead, including the gigantic Watchdog of Hel, Garm. Likewise, Fenrir and Jormungandr also break free and join Loki and the Giants.\n\nThe immense movements of these bigger than life beings cause natural disasters the world over and the waters of the oceans begin to rise.\n\nAfter endless fighting, the battle reaches its pinnacle. Thor defeats the gigantic serpent Jormungandr in a fight which lasts an age. Thor takes nine steps away from the massive beast, only to be felled himself by the poison he had suffered during the fight. Odin takes on Fenrir from the seat of his mighty horse and is swallowed whole, causing Frigg great sorrow despite their misgivings, as she had already lost her son Baldr. Tyr and Garm, locked, as well, in an endless struggle, die fighting each other. And likewise, Loki and Heimdall mortally wound each other. Ragnarok ends with gods and beast alike killing each other, before in a final blow, Surtr destroys everything and everyone. All Nine Realms are bathed in the fire of Surtr.\n\nAnd yet, from this... the world will rise again, cleansed and fertile. The few surviving gods meet and the world is repopulated by its human survivors. Surtr is not seen as a villain, but rather, the arrival of prophecy. Such bloodshed was wrecked on those plains that Surtr saw fit to end it all. And in the end, Surtr's actions paved the way for a better world to come.\n\nMY LOVE OF KRATOS' GREEK BACKSTORY IN 1-3:And what of Kratos' backstory in Greece?Well, it's quite a task to list all of his victims, so I will just provide a link:[https://za.ign.com/god-of-war-1/118842/gallery/every-god-kratos-has-killed?p=1](https://za.ign.com/god-of-war-1/118842/gallery/every-god-kratos-has-killed?p=1)Can you imagine adding a world-ending psychotic murderer like Kratos to the Norse mythos of Ragnarok? I was so hyped!!!\n\nOTHER FACTORS:With the PS5 allowing for bigger and better graphics, gameplay, and haptic feedback than ever before, and with so few true next-gen games taking advantage of the software, it was time.\n\nIt was time for God of War: RAGNAROK!!!!!!!!!!!!Two of the greatest world ending tales ever told SMASHED together!And so what happens when you smash Kratos and Ragnarok together?\n\nWHAT WE GOT:A 30 minute expedition through a dirt trench with repeat enemy types, a mask that was added to the mythos and then removed without any explanation of what it was or what purpose it was added to the story (a Chekov's gun that went unfired), and two end-game boss battles with zero set pieces taking place in the same muddy rainy pig sty in front of an old hut.\n\nWHAT ARE SOME WAYS WE COULD DELIVER ON THE HYPE:Well, it's not as easy as saying \"This is how we fix it.\" Rather, I thought perhaps I'd just share some off-the-top-of-my-head ideas of how God of War 5 could match the insanity that was the first three games and the hype that 2018 had promised.\n\nSOME IDEAS OF WHAT BOSS BATTLES COULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE:\n\n\\*NOTE: In this version of the game, Loki was trained with a spear in between 2018 and 2022's games, as any Spartan would teach their son how to use a spear. To quote Kratos \"All boys of Spartan heritage learn to use a spear, it is the first thing they learn.\" Also, keep in mind that the version of Ragnarok I wrote below seems immense because it SHOULD BE. It should not be an hour long frolic in the mud, it should be half a game if not an entire game dedicated to an insane world-ending battle. It is RAGNAROK. If you do not believe me that Ragnarok should be incredibly exciting, I beg you to read up on what happens in the Norse rendition of the event.\\*\n\n1. As Kratos, you and Loki are fighting einherjar on Jormungandr's back while you can see Jormungandr's head in the distance fighting what looks like lightning (you can kind of see it is Thor and his Hammer flicking through the skies). You are making your way towards its head but the constant movement of this gigantic beast are throwing you around. You are thrown at times from one massive part of the snake up into the air, perhaps wrestling momentarily with a flying Valkyrie in the air, before crashing down on the snake again; this time closer to your goal. However, as you are nearly there to help Jormungandr take down Thor, Thor manages to put his hammer into Jormungandr's bottom jaw and throw himself upwards, snapping the serpent's head in half, killing it. Mimir and Loki yell in horror! \"No... This cannae be. The prophecy said that Jormungandr would kill Thor!!\" Thor lands in front of you and you realise that, whatever this change in fates means, you must now fight Thor. As you take a step towards him, Heimdall flits in front of Loki and throws him to the dirt. Kratos, turns to Loki \"I trust you. Take care of this. You're ready!\" Loki nods, and Heimdall laughs: \"Ready for death, maybe.\" Meanwhile, Thor and Kratos have an immense lightning and frost filled battle that takes them across the skies. Down below on the plains, you can see incredible battles underway, including Tyr and Garm. After a long, set-piece riddled painful fight, you land back in front of the dead serpent, and when all seems lost, through teamwork, Kratos and Loki manage to pull one of Jormungandr's venom soaked fangs out, push Thor into a wall and slam the fang home. Heimdall shrieks annoyingly \"NO! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!\" Thor leans into Kratos and tells him to take care of his daughter, and then smiles and says \"It was a good fight.\"\n2. Kratos is incapacitated from his fight with Thor. Loki and Heimdall have at it. I actually liked the fight we had with Heimdall in the game we got, so I'd just do that, but instead have it so that Loki was trained with a spear in between 2018 and Ragnarok and have him fight Heimdall instead. Loki would eventually win. But then as they walk away, Heimdall, with his last breath, might do something that would make it SEEM like Loki had just been poisoned or mortally wounded or something as well. As this was prophecied, Kratos thinks that this is Loki's death about to happen. This would cause Kratos to go absolutely berserk. Enter Odin on Sleipnir\n3. Fighting an all-powerful Odin on his eight-fucking-legged monstrous badass flying horse, Sleipnir. Imagine having to dodge 8 gigantic giga-chad horse legs while a giant golden spear is smashing down on either side of you. Finally Kratos knocks Odin off the horse and climbs onto it and stamps around, pulling at its reins, killing a bunch of enemies himself, before pulling it down and breaking a few of its legs before slamming Odin's spear into its belly.\n\nMeanwhile, Odin's eyepatch has come off in the fight, and he looks up and has an imposing glowing eye. His knowledge has afforded him great magic. He floats up in the air. You're fighting massive amounts of mobs while he's raining down fire and wind and lightning. That would start a second fight with Odin where he's flying in the air above the plains using the powers that his knowledge have gifted him. At some point during the fight, Kratos' axe is entrapped somewhere and Odin does something that means you can't retrieve it despite calling for it. Kratos is forced to rely on his blades like the good old days. However, at some point, he see and picks up Mjolnir. With Thor's blessing, Kratos is worthy of the hammer. It would have the same fight buttons as the axe and be immensely powerful and able to shoot lightning. The fight rages on.\n\n4. In the interim, Loki is visited by Angrboda who is riding Fenrir, and they manage to help Loki heal. Perhaps Loki (Who is suppsed to be a Trickster God, after all) had managed to hide some aspect of himself in one of those orbs which hides your soul. After all, he learned from Brok and Sindri that souls are in four parts and you can live without one of them. That is to say, Atreus dies, but Loki lives on. Loki, now fully healed and with all of his powers of godly trickery unlocked, sees his father and Odin fighting, and continues some other epic battle, perhaps helping Garm fight Tyr, before meeting up with his father and having an epic conclusion to the Odin fight. Perhaps Odin becomes a gigantic bird-like beast due to his almost unparalleled magic ability and you manage to tear its wings off. A decrepit Odin crawls away before being eaten by Fenrir.\n\n5. The only boss battle left would be Surtr. Loki would have spent ages begging Kratos not to let Ragnarok happen as he knew that Surtr would purge it all. So perhaps there's a massive fight where Kratos is basically fighting what is essentially a gigantic volcano man, jumping from falling rock to falling rock to reach its head. But then Loki, who has realised what the prophecies really truly wanted, tells Kratos to let the Nine Realms fall. Kratos, who had spoken with Athena during the game, has had visions of what is left of Greece and is panicked. He begs his son not to let it happen again. But Loki tells Kratos \"Trust me... It is time for a new age.\" Kratos trusts him.\n\nWe watch as Yggdrasil and the Nine Realms are consumed by fire. But that's not the end... (Continued down below)\n\nSOME IDEAS OF HOW YOU COULD RETAIN KRATOS' AND LOKI'S CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHILE STILL HAVING THE GAME BE EXCITING:\n\nI totally understand that people have been saying \"Kratos should not be his angry old self anymore because he's supposed to be developed.\" However, I don't see those as mutually exclusive. You can have Thor be a sad drunk who mistreats his family still, but just have him, on his death bed, beg Kratos to be better than he was. Kratos doesn't have to be a pacifist. Odin is an unforgivable genocidal mad man. Kratos sees in Odin what Kratos himself used to be, a war-hungry genocidal maniac whose actions caused the deaths of his own loved ones. Except unlike Kratos, Odin does not see the death of his loved ones as a hurdle or a negative, but rather, just steps on the way to his own personal greatness. Why should Kratos feel ANY compunctions whatsoever with brutally ending this egomaniacal god's life?\n\nIn the end, yes, perhaps Atreus spiritually dies. But Loki lives. Once it's all over, Kratos would tell Loki \"You are ready, my son, to be who you were always meant to be.\" Loki would smile \"Thanks to you, father.\" Loki, the trickster he is, would have gotten around even Ragnarok, to be the only god who manages to live through it outside of Kratos. Loki might then help to rebuild a world from the ashes of Ragnarok so that it is a better place, with his father's aid of course. Unlike what happened to Greece, Kratos would want to stick around and not let the world fall into disrepair this time.\n\nThe endgame could be Kratos and Loki helping to build a better world from the ashes of the God's petty squabbles. Thus the story closes in a way that fulfills the idea of \"Being Better.\"\n\nFrom the fires, a beautiful world of rolling green plain and blue waters awaits the humans, no longer ruled by capricious gods.\n\nAnd guess what, that gives both Kratos AND Loki some motive to go to other worlds to free them from their terrible gods in the next games.",

        "text": "I´m well aware that latest with the rising popularity of the souls games the difficulty of games is quite a hot topic among gamers that´s being/has been discussed very frequently. Still I would also like to give my opinion on that as I have not been reading that one too often and never before anything impacted my personal gaming experience like what I´m going to try to describe now.\n\nTo come straight to the point, it´s about difficulty setting in games. I´m sure we all agree on the purpose and the positive aspects of giving gamers the change to adapt the challenge of games to their needs so that as many people as possible can have fun with respective games. And before anyone is going to accuse me of anything in the comments: No, I´m not speaking out for removing these options in games - I´m only talking about my personal experience and don´t think that I´m setting the standards or speaking for majority of gamers. I would be only interested, simply out of curiosity, if anyone else has a similar experience.\n\nI am having serious issues with playing games that come with difficulty settings and it has become a major factor for me in my decision if I´m even going to play a game or not. Let me explain: It starts already at the very beginning of the game, when I am about to choose the difficulty setting. In most cases, I have no idea what to select. Of course, in general you could say go for moderate or hard when you are experienced with that specific genre and take (very) easy mode in case you do not play video games that much. But still, I have no solid basis for deciding at the beginning, of how exactly this games measures difficulty or even how harder difficulties impact the game later on (classic example by larger enemy health bars for example). So why would I be even put in such a \"stressful\" decision right at the beginning (again, my personal view only).\n\nOk, you could say in many games I can still change it throughout the game. Yes, but in my case this ruins the experience even more for me. Easiest to explain by an example: I played God of War Ragnarok recently. A game that I have been very much looking forward to and also here I have to choose a difficulty in the beginning. I go for moderate difficulty as I want to have a challenge but a \"fair\" one, basically as developers intended the game to be. Now after the first two hours or so in I´m getting the feeling that the game feels too easy - e.g. no real tactics/strategy required in combat, I can pretty much do what I want and win. Now I´m starting to think: Is this maybe just the beginning of the game that´s supposed to be easy and will it get harder? Or maybe not and I am \"wasting\" my first experience with one of my most anticipated games this year because the combat is not satisfying enough for me this way?\n\nOk I think, then let´s simply try out turning the difficulty up a notch I mean that´s what it´s there fore after all right? But after doing that and getting into the first combat situation I´m playing a completely different game: Even smaller enemies get really spongy and deal massive damage, I die around 10 times in a row at the same encounter, I need to completely adapt how I play the game to win but not in a good way if you know what I mean, it feels like I almost need to cheese them from a distance and run in circles to have a winning chance. And there I begin to think again: This should not be my experience as well with God of War, after all I´m - yep - a God of War.\n\nSo I go back to normal mode again and it´s unsatisfying as well - far too easy. And I´m constantly left with the feeling after every encounter if I should now turn it up again - it seriously ruined the game for me.\n\nImportant to mention that this is not game specific for me, just one of the recent examples, I´m having the same issue with nearly every game that comes with difficulty options. Most recent one is chained echoes - exactly the same thing: I started at moderate, in the beginning it was easy and at some point I start thinking it gets too easy, I´m missing the challenge. I turn the difficulty up and it gets really frustrating real fast.\n\nI think this is the reason I love the souls series so much or maybe even that much, that i has spoiled other games for me. Here I know exactly that the whole game was to be designed for one difficulty setting, everything fits together for me. I know exactly that I have to get better at a boss fight by mastering the mechanics and not ask myself if the game design get´s flawed in case I am playing on a \"wrong\" difficulty setting.\n\nSo is it just me with this problem? Would be very interested to hear your opinions on that.\n\nThanks for reading through all of this in case you did :)",

        "title": "\"Naturalistic Dialogue vs Stilted Dialogue\" - Difference between West and Japan",
        "author": "Termi855",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/101sxn7/naturalistic_dialogue_vs_stilted_dialogue/",
        "text": "Recently I watched the video \"Final Fantasy VII Remake (dunkview)\" from videogamedunkey and at some point I pondered about the question: what is **good dialogue**?  \nHe uses four examples in his video about FF7 Remake for what is good **voice acting**:  \nUncharted 4, Firewatch, God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2. All of these games have been lauded a lot by the public and critics alike, which makes it unsurprising that their voice acting has been praised. And while they certainly share multiple attributes, the most important one is that all these games seem to be decidedly for a western audience and focus on naturalistic dialogue, a quality videogamedunkey also praised in his video about The Last of Us (by the argument of interruptions definitively being an element of naturalistic dialogue). \n\nBut I am starting to question myself, if dialogue and voice acting are getting thrown together. Especially if the intention of how dialogue needs to be presented is culturally different enough that it leads to the situation that the West directly criticizes voice acting, despite being just unfamiliar or disliking mannerisms of the actual dialogue.   \nI also want to formulate the definitions:  \nStilted dialogue is dialogue which would not be used in everyday life.   \n\n\nA concrete example from the Final Fantasy VII video: he criticizes the anime grunting of Cloud Strife as bad voice acting (technically it should be bad dialogue, but it gets a little unclear there as the video is more for entertainment and less for \"education\").   \nWhile I get the idea, and he is not exaggerating the amount of it being used within the game, it serves a purpose to characterize Cloud as emotionally distant and is quite effective at that:  \nAt first, it functions as a barrier to any interaction he has, even if you would want to hold a conversation, at one point he will just resort to these sounds which drown any interactions.   \nAlso, it ties directly into his self-perceived soldier image. A soldier needs to be cool, strong and always has to be above the situation. Him grunting implies that everything is beneath him.  \nLast but not least: He does not have much to communicate about as he is a relatively uninteresting character who has no real interests in anything beyond his next paycheck.  \nHim then starting to talk more and grunt less, showcases how he grows as a person.   \nAnd here is the thing:  \nI can not really say that it is bad dialogue as it serves a clear purpose, has a good interpretation and is technically a great version of \"show me don't tell\".   \nAnd FF7 does this repeatedly, another example:  \n\"You know I can't do that.\"  \nAt first these words get uttered by the turk Rude who interacts with Aerith and Cloud to explain why he needs to fight them. He is a paid gangster who does dirty jobs, if the need arises.   \nWhile this role sounds cool, the idea gets pushed to its limit as the turks are extremely confident in their abilities but play their role a little too straight that it borders on being ridiculous.   \nAnd Rude is the most severe case of that: tall, dark and handsome, trying his hardest to be mysterious and cool.   \nIf you have played the original, this is only somewhat true. Relatively speaking, he is shy and hides behind the facade, but can back it up with actions and a good heart.  \nThe remake continuity even implies that Rude was already a guest at Aerith's home and on a name basis with them.   \nWhen Rude loses the fight and gets pulled from the arena, he orders Aerith to stay home and safe.  \nWhich gets mockingly answered with \"You know I can't do that.\". Leaving Rude puzzled and at a loss of words for the first time.   \nThis tells a lot about their respective relationship as relatively friendly and Aerith gets to have a comedic moment that needs quick wits. Also, it makes Rude more human and less of an emotionless killing machine that he tries to present himself as.   \nAdditionally, it references the role of Aerith over the course of the original FF7: destroying that armor of untruths Cloud tries to tell himself to create distance from others. Just like Rude does in this specific situation.   \n\n\nThese are two examples I think are important to reference from Final Fantasy VII Remake as the dialogue itself is perfectly fit to serve a specific function. While it is stilted and overexaggerated, it is hard to call it bad, if there is so much analysis to it. And all in all FF7 Remake has been positively accepted by the JRPG community but less by some western fans. Of course there could be many reasons for this problem, and I am not knowledgeable enough on Japanese culture to give more reasoning than: They like overexaggeration to make a point.   \nThis overexaggeration can lead to a high information density or stylized actions and reactions which then provide entertainment value.\n\nHerein lies somewhat of an issue: I have yet to play the other games that have been listed at the beginning of this rant and this makes a comparison difficult.   \nBut I think the core argument I am trying to make is that there is a naturalistic dialogue elitism in the western hemisphere which then leads to devaluing well written but stilted dialogue which serves its purpose. Reducing dialogue to being good, if it is naturalistic seems unhealthy.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/101p8l0/the_consumables_rant/",
        "text": "Hi everyone, this is a topic that maybe has been discussed at length without me noticing but it actually seems to be something that either only I and maybe a few other people have an issue with or something that is actually more annoying than people realize. I'm talking about \"Consumables\" in games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor \"consumable\" I'm defining any item the game provides you in order to receive a one time bonus. This goes from your average health potion to items that change the gameplay for a brief amount of time; really it can be anything as long as the effect is temporary, one time and tied to an item.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with consumables (or rather the reason why I think they are problematic) is that I think they are used mainly or entirely as a crutch. Let me explain:\n\nIn most situations the reliance on consumables really stifles and even ruins gameplay systems. It feels like even in the most well designed systems you are only as good as how much stuff you're able to carry and how much preparations you make.\n\nThe most egregious example of this is the fact that many games' combat or challenge is reliant on the fact that you can recover your health with consumables turning every encounter at max difficulty as a chugfest.\n\nOther games give you so many different consumables that you'll be carrying them around everywhere and either hoarding them until the right moment or just trivializing things with the right consumable.\n\nThey are more often than not things that actually limit design rather than expand it. They force designers to think that every player has easy access to consumables and thus they need to consider that when making the combat and other gameplay systems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost I'd like to see many more games simply do away with them altogether. Not every game needs a way to recover health in combat; you can make a very cool and exciting combat system this way.\n\nCase in point my favourite way to play Yakuza 0 is without every using consumables. That game's combat system turns entirely on its head that way, especially at maximum difficulty.\n\nSuddenly every hit matters instead of simply chugging down items to increase health and the \"heat meter\" which suddenly becomes an interesting mechanic since not every move is available at any \"heat level\" so you have to learn how to manage it instead of just hopping into the inventory.\n\nThis is basically impossible in many if not all of the \"new\" Yakuza, including the Judgement series, because the devs have designed the game with heavy amounts of consumables in mind making avoiding all hits an impossible feat. The over reliance on consumables makes the devs make encounters more deadly because players have access to crazy power buffs and health regeneration.\n\nI feel that these kinds of games would benefit more from not having consumables and making the player improve by engaging with the combat mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen in games that don't want to (or don't need to) do away with consumables I would urge developers to seriously consider what impact each and every consumable has in your game. If you just want your players to have every possible crazy scenario possible then sure go ahead but adding consumables \"just because it's cool\" or \"because every other game in the genre has it\" is not really a good reason to have them. \n\nAlso keep in mind the availability of the consumable; making a very good consumable very rare might seem like an obvious idea but it basically makes the player paranoid about using it instead of keeping it for \"tough encounters\". On the flipside making them too abundant trivializes most encounters.\n\nAn example would be Morrowind which made levitation potions (or magicka potions for levitation spells) so easy to find and make that you could be spending the entire game in the air if you wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think a good idea on how to make a consumables system is The Witcher 3's (I mean it's a good direction to aim for, not necessarily a good system by itself).\n\nIn the Witcher 3 (and the Witcher 2 aswell) the need for potions and oils and bombs is known in advance because once you know you have to deal with a certain monster then you make the consumable you need and the entire fight is designed around using the consumable. There's no need to hoard it in case you need it and they have very specific uses instead of being general improvements and bonuses. There's also the toxicity mechanic which limits the abuse of potions. \n\nStill I think there was too much reliance on consumables for healing and that the ingredient hunting for consumables gets tiresome easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion I simply believe that too many games have consumables in them because \"you gotta have'em\" instead of having a good reason to have them. Make them work and design them *into* the systems rather than making them something that works *in spite* of the systems.",

        "text": "Now i will preface this by saying i absolutely love New Vegas. In fact, it's one of my favorite games of all time, right up there with Prey (2017) and the Dark Souls games. I love the story, i love the characters, i love the amount of choices you get in completing even the most basic of quests, i love how much the RPG mechanics and skill cheeks play into the gameplay, it is simply an almost masterpiece. However one aspect that i always found lacking and this feeling got amplified times 10 after i played Fallout 3 and 4 is the fact that the open world, as in the Mojave dessert is so lifeless and boring. is it the worst open world of all time? No, i don't think so. Is it the worst open world out of all the open world Fallouts? By a country mile and here's my 2 main reasons: \n\n1. The dessert itself looks unapealing and unexciting - Now, don't get me wrong here, dessert open worlds can work when done well (The Mad Max game for example) but this is not one of those times. Maybe it's just me but i found the archaic bombed out, utterly drained out of life wasteland of Fallout 3 and the different biomes and climates of Fallout 4 way more intruiging as an overworld in general. Fallout 4 especially excells in this. It's as if the game is tempting you at every corner to wander off and see what you can find. That sense of wonder and a feeling of \"Ooooh, what's that over there?\" is just not present in New Vegas. Well, except the Strip but that's only one\n2. Aside from locations tied to quests not a single other location is even remotely interesting to explore - This is my personal biggest problem with New Vegas's open world and i think even the biggest New Vegas fans would have to agree with me. Like think about it, besides the quest related locations, what other place in New Vegas is even remotely memorable? On the other hand. Fallout 3 has the Nuka Cola factory, Hubris Comics in DC proper, Evergreen Mills, The Deathclaw Sanctuary, Fort Bannister to name a few. Fallout 4 as well has a ton of good places like the Libertalia though i'm not as familiar with 4 as i am with 3 as i haven't finished it",

It's not that I don't enjoy them, I do, it's just that I'm constantly thinking \"when is this gonna end\" or \"what should I play next\" and I never just end up enjoying the game as much as I would otherwise. \n\nIt's seriously hampered my ability to enjoy things (while this specific post is about video games this problem happens with all forms of media in general) im constantly worried about the next thing or FOMO, or if my friends have already played it I think \"well what's the point of playing if they've already done it\" it feels like im constantly playing catch up when im playing and im just playing for the sake of completing everything. I just wish i could plag and get invested and not be thinking about what comes after again. and play for the story or gameplay again, seeiously i cant even enjoy games stories because of this problem of constantly looking for things i mightve missed or catching up. Any advice on how to fix this?",

        "text": " \n\nHi. I liked to rely on Metacritic user score as a 'source of truth' for game quality - and, doing this in the last 10 years, I was pretty happy with results. Most of my all time favorite games (Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate 2, Deux Ex, Persona 4 Golden, Nier: Automata) all oscillate around 9/10 user scores, so it nicely matches my impressions. Unfortunately, something has changed in 2022.\n\nI see more and more games that are either 'average' or 'good', suddenly getting extremely good user scores. Examples:\n\n[https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/steelrising](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/steelrising)\n\n[https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/tales-of-arise](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/tales-of-arise)\n\n[https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/omori](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/omori) (this one actually deserves a high score, but maybe not so high)\n\nSteelrising was basically rated as a 'decent / clunky Souls-like', and it sits on 8.7. Tales of Arise - many people complain about reused assets, story going down to drain in last 1/3 of the game, and it sits on 8.6. Omori - I liked the game, especially the ending part, but it's rated higher than Planescape: Torment at this point. All the games are pretty recent releases.\n\nSo, straight to the point: is anybody aware of any changes Metacritic did in the last 2 years that are suddenly over-estimating games user score? Should I stop using it as a source of truth?\n\nTL;DR: Metacritic user scores seems to be overrated in the last 2 years and it would be great to know the reason.",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nI understand that this post might be more appropriate for the designated *Sonic Frontiers* subreddit, but, if isn’t too much to ask for, please bear with me; it has been challenging for me, even when I’ve really tried to be respectful and transparent, to simply convey opinions in the sectors of Reddit where the more volatile of the *Sonic the Hedgehog fan base* reside— I hope I can connect my expressed thoughts to a larger conversation of gaming.\n\n**Contextualizing my Preferences**\n\n- Alright, when to the comes to admittedly arbitrarily made separation between more open-ended, exploratory video games and those that are more structured and linear, I ultimately prefer the latter for its more controlled, engaging sense of fun, whereas I generally find myself caught between either boredom or feeling overwhelmed by the former.\n\n- Because of my gameplay preferences, I was initially feeling doubtful that the emphasis on exploration that *Sonic Frontiers* publicized wouldn’t mesh well, which is okay as video games do not HAVE to cater to my preferences, but after having played the video game itself on and off after having been generously gifted it during the holidays, I have been pleasantly surprised.\n\n- Now, from what I understand, that the *Sonic the Hedgehog* franchise in general has been levied the stigma of being the best, most prominent “mediocre” franchise in the industry that serves as a decent distraction next to the “actual titans of gameplay design”, but I sincerely feel that *Sonic Frontiers* - even if it’s just potential - has very strong ideas that, if further developed and worked upon, can contribute significantly to gaming in general.\n\n**Cyberspace Levels**\n\n- Alright, the more sophisticated and mature of YouTube analysts on Sonic video games have described that essential *Core Tenets* of Sonic gameplay are *Speed*, *Platforming*, and *Exploration* (which may technically be more applicable to the classic, 2D games, but I think there’s still interesting potential to be found in seeing how the *Core Tenets* theoretically manifest in 3D Sonic — I’d recommend the following YouTube channels for a more in-depth analysis into the *Core Tenets* of Sonic: [theKazeblade](https://youtu.be/xLJSRJfZkRk) and [ShayMay](https://youtu.be/-AK3n-srj5E)).\n\n- As far as the *Core Tenets* for *Sonic Frontiers* goes, I understand that the game emphasizes a reinvigorated approach to the *Exploration* tenet, but something I have admittedly been yearning to see a bit more of in *Sonic the Hedgehog* video games is an emphasis on the *Platforming* tenet; I feel that *Sonic Frontiers*, for the most part, at least makes a commendable effort to include more involved platforming.\n\n- It’s not my intention to stroke myself over my own Reddit content— I mean to hopefully  use a constructive allegory by linking a response to a post of mine on the designated subreddit for *Sonic Frontiers* that [encouraged me to rethink how I perceive the game’s Cyberspace levels](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicFrontiers/comments/zx23o8/my_first_impressions/j1yj438/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) by seeing Sonic’s floaty aerial physics as something to take advantage of; thanks to the response’s input, the Cyberspace levels have now come to make for my favorite parts of *Sonic Frontiers*, not only for their more contained, structured gameplay, but also how there seems to be more trust put into the player to take advantage of the Air Boost ability of Sonic’s to strategically make jumps and cover extensive airtime, making for a truly engaging platforming experience in itself.\n\n**The “Mini Levels” in the Open Zones**\n\n- The component of the gameplay of *Sonic Frontiers* that has made for the most pleasant surprise for me has been the presence of the “Mini Levels” (the floating arrangement of the platforms, springs, grinding rails, booster panels, etc that are scattered within and throughout the Open Zones) as they provide me with the structured, controlled, and arcade appeal of  platforming gameplay.\n\n- Given their abundance, I IMMENSELY appreciate how these “Mini Levels” provide for a mostly optional alternative to a given process of getting from point A to point B without being overwhelmed by the disorganized landscape or bored by the more monotonous form of travel; maybe such has already been the case in more open-ended, exploratory video games that I have yet to realize, but I sincerely feel that *Sonic Frontiers* really has something going for it with this idea of “Mini Levels” as an alternative form of exploration.\n\n- I’ll try to use a theoretical, alternative version of *The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild* (BOTW) as an example of the potential application of the “Mini Levels” of *Sonic Frontiers*; I know that BOTW already has its signature Shrines serve as “fast travel waypoints”, but what I feel would be especially neat is if the Shrines themselves were all interconnected with each other to form a technologically advanced, interconnected, and structured underground  labyrinth with traversal puzzles and combat as an alternative to the more open air exploration of Hyrule Kingdom on the surface.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "\nFor the last few years I've made a little note of every game i played in my journal I played and gave it a quick gut feeling score out of 10 to look back on at the end of the year. \n\nThis year i decided to put it on Google Sheets so i could share it here and hopefully discuss any and all placements that [Heres my 2022 results.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-12L1UblZ_x9kRQJ22PWkdch2ilnHywoBJ8KN2Ag2PM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\nSince the 1-10 system can be pretty vague here's ROUGHLY how i would describe each numerical score.\n\n10- Damn near Perfect: The kind of game that sticks with you. I dount ill ever forget playing it and cant wait to play it again \n\n9-  Amazing: Some mild nitpicks but extremely enjoyable and impressive \n\n8- Great: Plenty to enjoy but enough flaws that I can see why some might not\n\n7- Very good: Fun while it lasts but not much to gush about. \n\n6- Good: Enough good that I can see the appeal but just didnt quite click with me\n\n5-Average: Not bad, a decent timesink but kind of forgettable \n\n4-Interesting: Needs some polish. Good ideas and could be on to something if a sequel improved it\n\n3- Disappointing- Playable but the Cons VASTLY outweigh the Pros\n\n\n2- Frustrating.  SOME redeemable ideas or moments but just not enjoyable to play\n\n1- BAD- Either Badly Designed, Badly Written or just Literally Unplayable. Could NEVER recommend\n\n\nBut again this wont paint my EXACT feelings on any game and im more than happy to discuss any placement that you're curious about. :)",
