When he looks at the menu, he sees that they offer albatross soup, and he orders it. When the soup comes he takes one bite and puts down the spoon. He then leaves the restaurant and goes out to his car without payinging. He gets into his car and drives off the cliff into the ocean below, killing himself instantly. Why did he drive off the cliff?",

Help me guess the correct answer and we'll split the money 50/50! You can either comment below or pm me what you think it is. \n\n\nOkay, so... [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydJhbeVZvk8&amp;feature=youtu.be) is the link to the secret sound (which in this clip is on repeat). \n\n\nThere are also a bunch of clues tied to the correct answer, and at this point in time they are:\n\n\n**Clue 1:** The Secret Sound is really hard, this is a clue don't discard.\n\n\n**Clue 2:** The Secret Sound is SO RUDE\n\n\n**Clue 3:** Someone online is very close. Add half an on air guess and you'll take home my treasure chest. - [Here is a link to what has already been guessed.](http://www.zmonline.com/zms-secret-sound/zms-secret-sound-whats-been-guessed/)\n\n\n**Clue 4:** [Is a picture clue.](https://imgur.com/a/FIsYq)\n\n\n**Clue 5:** [Another picture clue.](https://imgur.com/a/VTxLQ) The consensus is that this clue means 'not plastic' - the girls in the movie were in a group called The Plastics.\n\n\n**Clue 6:** The sound relates to a song written by a female. (I mean seriously, this isn't very helpful lol)\n\n\n**Clue 7:** The secret sound doesn't involve coins (a lot of people were guessing coins)\n\n\n**Clue 8:** [And lastly a 360 degree facebook video](https://www.facebook.com/ZMonline/videos/2106956532662455/) - and apparently somewhere in this video is whatever makes the secret sound.\n\n\nOne other thing I should add - it has been said that the sound was made in a tiny office studio. So 'larger' things e.g shopping trolleys, vending machines etc, most likely aren't what is making the sound. There is also the possibility that the correct answer is two objects making the secret sound!\n\nI've slowed down the sound and had a play with it on audacity - to me it sounds mechanical.. but I'm not entirely convinced.\n\n\nI need your help! \n\nEdit: New clue! ‘To set the sound free you must be aware, the sound you seek is part of a pair’ -&gt; must be 2 objects making the sound then ?",

The dialogue went like this, with the two characters asking each other riddles:  \n  \n\"Which is better: A clock that is right once a year, or a clock that is right twice a day?\"  \n\"The latter.\"  \n\"Very good. Now, I have two clocks: one doesn't go at all, and the other loses a minute a day: which would you prefer?\"  \n\"The one that doesn't move at all.\"  \n\"Why so would that be?\"  \n\"Clocks are made so that you don't need to keep track of the time. The clock which loses a minute a day has to lose twelve hours, or seven hundred and twenty minutes before it is right again, consequently it is only right once in two years, whereas the other is evidently right as often as the time it points to comes round, which happens twice a day.\"  \n\"Ahah, but, what's the use of its being right twice a day, if I ca'n't tell when the time comes?\"  \n\"What use is a clock that requires you to keep track of time in order to tell the time? Come now: both clocks are without use, but one clock's inner workings are faulty, while the other has something stopping it from moving. Which do you think is harder to repair?\"  \n\"Why, I'm certain a clock with half of its parts working is better than a clock with no parts at all.\"  \n  \nAfter that the dialogue is interrupted, but I planned one more response. I'm pretty sure I'd remember it if someone got the answer, so I'm asking for everyone's help: Why is an unmoving clock better than a broken one?",

        "text": "Somebody was murdered in the middle of an empty intersection.\n\nThe police acted swiftly and interrogated all the pedestrians that were on that road at the time, given that the dead person was a high ranking army general, although not in uniform.\n\nThe first person said \"*I just came out of the bus. I did nothing else, sir.*\"\n\nThe detective (represented by the bold text) was surprised, and replied:\n\n\"**What bus? Buses don't stop there, do they?**\"\n\n\"*Like I told you, I just came out of the bus. That's it.*\"\n\n\"**What bus, again? Was there any bus sign there?**\"\n\n\"*I didn't check for any bus signs, sir. All I know is I had my bag with me and I went out of the bus.*\"\n\n\"**That's assuming there were any buses at all.**\"\n\n\"*I cannot even use a gun! Why would I ever kill someone?*\"\n\n\"**You cannot use a gun, okay. In what situations does this rule apply?**\" \n\n\"*Sir, trust me, I swear I did not kill that man. I don't even know who is he! To be honest, I just saw one guy kind of falling down or something, but I didn't really look close and see his face.*\"\n\n\"**You're going to have to elaborate, of course.**\"\n\n\"*I don't know, some guy falling down, maybe he passed out or something.*\"\n\n\"**You know he fell down, you know he passed out. And you never looked at his face? Really?**\"\n\n\"*I mean, like, a guy was like standing, and then like, he fell down or something. Looked like he was hurt. I didn't really walk near him to check what happened.*\"\n\n\"**And why should I believe you?**\"\n\n\"*No, sir, honestly, I didn't look closer, so that's all I can remember about this.*\"\n\n\"**Well then, okay. I might get back to you after I interrogate the rest of the people. If this bus doesn't show up, I'm warning you!**\"\n\nThe detective left, while a bit angry, to the second interrogation room:\n\nHe asked the second person, \"**Did you see a bus stopping anywhere at that time?**\"\n\n\"*I was just walking, I didn't really concentrate on my surroundings, so maybe there was a bus I didn't see, I'm not sure, though.*\"\n\n\"**Today is not the right time to be confused. Whatever you're not saying, say it. Was there anything unusual that you saw?**\"\n\n\"*I don't think so. To be honest, I didn't look around much so I don't really know, but, no, I don't think there was anything particularly unusual. The general was dead a long while after I was walking, so I only turned around at that time, and even then, I was too far to see anything in detail. Plus, I was too scared to walk past a dead man, and I think anybody else would've had the same feeling. I wasn't sure if anybody was following me or looking at me or not, so I just ran as fast as I could, until I saw a guy, so I told him what happened and then he called the cops.*\"\n\n\"**Okay, let me believe you for just a while. What did you see, whether it was strange or not?**\"\n\n\"**Again, I don't remember, so I could be wrong, but, no, nothing strange or unusual or something like that.*\"\n\n\"**Again, what you're not saying, what you're not telling me, you better talk!**\"\n\n\"*Honestly, I'm telling you everything I know!*\"\n\n\"**And, very conveniently, you know nothing, right?**\"\n\n\"*Seriously. I. Do not. Remember. Okay? Is not remembering something unlawful to do?*\"\n\n\n\n\"**I'm going to go check the other interrogation room. You better remember this, or you're going to be remembering your time in jail instead!**\"\n\nThe detective went out of the room, feeling a bit confused, and went into the third interrogation room.\n\nThe third person said, \"*He was hit by two bullets, right?*\"\n\n\"**Was he?**\"\n\n\"*From the picture, there are two gunshot wounds, no?*\"\n\n\"**Maybe. Why are you asking?**\"\n\n\"*Well, I was just curious. It seems there may have been some fighting before the man was shot. Defensive wounds on his arms.*\"\n\n\"**I don't know. Do you?**\"\n\n\"*I didn't kill the man, if that's what you mean. The defensive wounds mean somebody must have noticed the fighting going on, probably.*\"\n\n\"**Okay, let's just go on with your story. Was there anything unusual that you saw back then?**\"\n\n\"*Well, yes, there was a man who fell down, who could be the dead guy in the photo, although I didn't approach him to see his face. I couldn't see any bullets or where they came from, so I suspect that whoever killed this man may be a hitman. I can understand if silencers were used, but silencers can't move the wind. This bullet came from somewhere, and if I didn't hear it, then at least I should've seen it, no? I didn't. I'm telling you, this is probably the work of an assassin! To be honest with you, though, I'm not really sure...*\"\n\n\"**Well, I think now is right time to be sure!**\"\n\n\n\"*Well, look, I'm telling you everything I know. That man fell down like he perhaps passed out, which is inconsistent with the gunshot wounds, at least as far as I know. Maybe he was drugged and then shot, which to me seems surprising, given that powerful drugs may be lethal, but at least they would not necessarily show any wounds. In other words, the whole thing seems explicitly set up to look like the man just passed out and was not actually murdered.*\"\n\n\"**It seems as if you know the little details. And you say you did not kill that man. Are you sure about that?**\"\n\n\"*Sir, what I was saying was merely a conjecture. That man could have been killed in a million ways. None of them involve me killing him!*\"\n\n\"**And none of them involve you calling the cops, is that correct?**\"\n\n\"*If this murder was really the act of a hitman, then the last thing you want to do is to be near a dead body, holding a telephone. Movies can sometimes be unrealistic, but in this case, maybe not so much.*\"\n\n\"**Some movies also have people going to jail. And  I think I know who that person is going to be!**\"\n\n\"*Well, it isn't me!*\"\n\n\"**You should hope it isn't. You really should! I have to go now, and you better hope it's good news if I ever come back here!**\"\n\nThe detective went out of the room, and after a while spent discussing the murder with the other cops, he went back to the first interrogation room:\n\n\"**So, about that bus that apparently parked near a non-existent bus stop.**\"\n\n\"*Sir, when you get out of a bus, do you explicitly observe your surrounding environment to look for a bus stop sign? I don't think so. So what if there was no bus stop sign, why does it matter anyway?*\"\n\n\"**Are you saying, hypothetically if there wasn't, or that there in fact wasn't?**\"\n\n\"*Sir, I do not know if there was a bus stop sign there. I don't care. Why does it matter?*\"\n\n\"**I might come back here later. You better find out where that bus was!**\"\n\nThe detective finally knew who the murderer was. Can you?",

        "text": "Hi, riddlers! I am not sure if you are familiar with apps such as Dark Stories or Why?! Dark Mysteries. I find them to be great fun when you have some time to kill with your friends (for example, when you are travelling long distance, relaxing on the beach, etc), and I thought we could try something similar here, but with our own made-up (or factual, why not?) stories.\nAll these apps share a simple concept: one player reads the beginning of the story out loud, and then the solution (the 'catch,' the explanation...) only to him or herself. The stories generally involve some sort of a crime, collusion, deception, etc. - hence, 'dark stories.' Other players take turns asking questions that will help them figure out the solution, but only yes-no question can be posed. The player who knows the whole story can answer with 'yes,' 'no,' or 'irrelevant.' The goal, of course, is to arrive at the solution.\nHere is a couple of examples, copy-pasted from the app Dark Stories:\n\n1. TOO LATE\nA woman runs through a corridor but suddenly stops and, with tears in her eyes, turns around.\nSolution: [spoiler](/s \"The woman was a lawyer who finally got the pardon for her client, sentenced to death. She was running to the electric chair room to stop the execution when she saw the corridor lights blinking. At that moment she realized it was too late.\")\n\n2. A PREMATURE DEATH (my personal favorite)\nA man who was expecting to die in a few days dies sooner than he thought.\nSolution: [spoiler](/s \"The man was really sick and he had decided to donate his organs to a rich man. Since this rich man's son wanted to inherit his father's fortune he poisoned the donor so that his organs became unable to work again in his fathers body.\")\n In the second example, the players might first find out that the man was killed. Then, that he was killed so that someone could inherit a fortune. Then they might figure out that the man himself wasn't necessarily rich, but that there is another death involved, etc.\n\nWhat makes these stories different from riddles is that, for the most part, the information provided at the beginning is not sufficient to devise a solution. Traditional riddles are, thus, more ingenious on the face of it and harder to think of, but the dark-stories format also allows for some interesting possibilities. The stories may be simple and straightforward, but they may also be mini-novellas, with multiple events and characters all coming together to produce a single story. One story from the app Why?!, for example, takes place in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. Naturally, this info is initially withheld from the players, as they must figure it out themselves with the right questions. Be sure to check out the apps I mentioned for more examples.\nAnyone interested to give this a try? One user presents the story, and the others ask him/her questions to reveal the solution. The user who correctly cracks the whole story gets to post his/her own.",

        "text": "So this is a cool riddle I was told by a random guy in the middle of nowhere, took me several weeks to figure that out, I hope you'll enjoy solving it !\n\n(I saw this seems to have been posted before, but it also seems to be quite old so here I go)\n\nSo here's the pitch, in a poorly worded english (please tell me if this isn't clear) :\n\nSo you're in a prison on an island in the middle of the Pacific ocean (precise location unkown). This is a maximum security prison and you're with 99 other prisoners.\n\nOne day, the prison manager was bored and decided to play a game, where you would be freed if you won, but you would die if you were to lose.\n\nwhat a fantastic pitch, isn't it ? The point there is that there is no way you can escape.\n\nThe rules are as follows : \n\n+ The night before the game, all the prisoners are in the same cell, and are allowed to communicate. \n\n+ The following day, each prisoner will have an hat put on their head, either black or white.\n\n+ You don't know how many white and black hat there are. could be anywhere between 0 whites/100blacks to 100/0.\n\n+ The 100 prisoners are then put on a line. A prisoner can't see its hat. The last person on the line sees all the hats excepted their own. The first person sees no hat.\n\n+ The guards will then ask the last prisoner on the line the color of its hat (remember, this prisoner sees all the other hats). If they fail, they're killed. Otherwise, they're free.\n\n+ The prisoner can only say black or white **no codes whatsoever !**\n\n+ The other prisoners are hearing what the interrogated one is saying\n\n+ Once the last prisoner has been interrogated, the guard asks the same question to the next prisoner in the list, all the way to the end\n\nYou have to come up with a strategy to save as many prisoners as you can. It is possible to save 99 of them with certainty. Good luck !\n\nIf you have questions, post them under the automod comment I'll lurk there from time to time.\n\nHere is an illustration of the line of prisoners. They look to the right, and the first interrogated is the one on the left.\n\no:) •:) o:) o:) o:) •:)\n\n^^\\^ ^^first ^^one\n\n\n**if you can't save the 99 prisoners, go ahead and post your answer ! It is fun to see all the ways the people are taking  (well other than random obviously)**",
