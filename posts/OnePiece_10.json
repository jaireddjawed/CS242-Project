He always seem so much stiffer than at the beginning, I don't even remembering the manga of the newer chapters being so straight, what happened to his whippier attacks? Wbu guys?",

In the flashback, she seems so foreign compared to the simpler designs early on. Uta: purple eyes, multi colored hair, giant headphones, double loopy hair VS Luffy: black haired regular kid. She looks like a goddamn fanfic insert, budget Miku headass looking ass. Her design as a kid shouldve atleast toned down her hairstyle and maybe get rid of her headphones so she doesn't stickout like a sore thumb. When she's an adult it fits since she's a popstar, but in the flashback it clashes hard with the villagers/Luffy.\n\n\\-Shanks being connected to this random character is so out-of-leftfield / retconned and it definitely felt like Shanks was used to just sell Uta's music.\n\n\\-The movie went halfhearted in both the music and action aspect... Should've fully embraced one aspect and done it well instead of doing two aspects halfheartedly...\n\n\\-Why are there so many unnecessary fanservice cameos. I mean I get it... recently One Piece movies have a hardon for unnecessary cameos but cmon.. Law, Bartholomew, Katakuri, and Bigmom and Co like why are they in the movie....I'ts bad enough they keep hamfisting Admirals in recent movies...\n\n\\-Demon king? Really? A bit on the nose. Dumbass schizo big boi antagonist for the group to punch at the end.\n\n\\-I won't complain about the story since most all One Piece movies I've seen the story's are generally mediocre. The story was just as good as any other average OP movie but the other shit I mentioned bothered me..",

        "text": "So I have been looking around and I havent seen this theory anywhere at all but basically I think I have a pretty solid idea of who the traitor is.\n\nSo basically I think it is the yet to be revealed Seraphim of Doflamingo aka S-flamingo. Let me explain.\n\nAs we all know the Seraphim have a hierarchy  of command and we also know they cant take orders via den den mushi. So then why is it that the seraphim are outright disobeying the 6 vegas. We do know that a gorosei member is on the way but he isn't there yet and it can't be his command making them act this way since we know the rules about den den mushi. Many people have been theorizing one of the vegas being the traitor because of all the shielding going down and the seraphim going wild but to me that would not explain why they won't listen to other vegas. Additionally there is just no clear indication as to which one it could be with them being taken out left and right. Which leads me to shaka.\n\nShaka was just shot in the head and the only clue we have at ALL as to who did this was the \"ktok\" sound effect which is the heel sound effect. Now who do we know of in the world of one piece that wears heels and uses a gun? None other than the heavenly demon Doflamingo. Up until now Doflamingo's Seraphim has not been introduced in any capacity but I have no reason to believe that Vegapunk didn't make a Seraphim clone of him.\n\nDoflamingo, being originally of celestial dragon origin puts him near on par with the gorosei. Now I know the hierarchy image I included doesn't mention regular celestial dragons but it also doesn't mention marines of any kind and im sure there are plenty of people with jurisdiction that Oda just didn't mention in that panel. Being a celestial dragon, perhaps S-flamingo is able to retain some or most of his original will, and being a Seraphim he would know the ins and outs of Eggheads defenses and being a celestial he would be able to give the other seraphim orders. We already know that members of doffys crew were experimented on from impel down so I imagine he was as well. \n\nLastly as far as a potential motive goes there are plenty potential ones, but the one that stands out the most to me is just a general wanting of revenge against the straw hats, and even the world government since hes been locking up various cipher pol agents.

That near fatal nosebleeds don't always have to happen and that the over used gag doesn't have to be the main quirk of a character. You also have shown us that depraved minds can grow and mature, even after suffering from the trauma of being isolated on an island filled with only drag queens (no disrespect to anyone who chooses to live this life and who would enjoy this life). \n\nYou showed us that Masculinity doesn't have to be toxic. It can be a chivalrous way to live provided that one disciplines oneself to honor and care for those around us. That you can depend on others and that it is no loss of honor when we rely on others to take care of the tasks that we can't handle. \n\nThat competition between friends can be a healthy way to build up not only your own skills, but hone those of your friends. You also show us that not everything has to be a competition. Accepting our roles is an important part of life. \n\nNobility isn't something you're born into, it's a life decision we make every day. Being a Prince doesn't mean that we receive everything on a silver platter, but that when we earn and work towards our goals, we really achieve something special. Real Royalty is gained through treating others better than we would treat ourselves. \n\nThanks for being yourself Sanji,\n\nSincerely a fan.",

        "text": "Note: First off, not sure if this qualifies as a theory or not, and if so I can change the flair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone knows that Perona wants to reunite with her captain Gecko Moria after episode 917, Perona learns that Gecko Moria is alive after rumors of Doflamingo trying to kill him after the Marineford War spread shortly after the events that transpired there. Gecko Moria has been hunting down Blackbeard after they kidnapped Absalom and eventually meets his crewmates at Hachinosu only to learn that &gt;!Absalom was killed and his Devil Fruit was given to Shiryu!&lt;. It's unknown what happened to Moria afterwards minus Blackbeard offering him to join his crew. Going back to Perona, she left Kuraigana Island after a small verbal banter between her and Hawkeye (that ends up being nice) and began searching for her captain.\n\nI can imagine this happening, and this is an idea I've had for a few months now. I've just been nervous of uploading for personal reasons: \n\nPerona finally gets to Hachinosu to \"reunite\" with Moria. Moria pretends to be nice and caring towards Perona, similarly to how \"Absalom\" was to Moria when they \"reunited.\" Gecko then mentions he has no reason for her to be around and refers to her as \"dead weight.\"\n\nHe then asks the \"captain\" what to do only for it to be none other than Blackbeard; Gecko Moria accepted his offer to join the crew. Blackbeard would then say he can do what he pleases, it's \"his problem to deal with.\" Heartbroken and angered, Perona tries to attack Moria only to be wounded by Van Auger. Gecko then runs Perona out of Hachinosu, wounded onto a small boat she used to travel there. Gecko then stops Van Auger from taking a fatal shot and mentions that she'll probably succumb to her injuries. \n\nPerona then passes out in her boat and is eventually (more like luckily) found by the Straw Hats and treated by Chopper. She then wakes up and freaks out when she realizes where she is, but Chopper manages to calm her down and mention her arm is still injured. Shortly after, she explains what happened to her, only to break down in tears.\n\nShe doesn't have anywhere to go; The Marines have probably swarmed Kuraigana Island and she'd be arrested instantly, she doesn't know where Hawkeye is since &gt;!he joined Cross Guild with Buggy's crew and Crocodile!&lt;. Despite the incredibly negative drawback from most of the crew aside Zoro, who mentions she's actually incredibly nice from his time with her at Kuraigana Island and Sanji, who of course will protect a pretty lady, Luffy agrees that she can stay on the ship.\n\nPerona would have a similar experience to Brook's first few days on the ship; being a bit clumsy here and there, but eventually getting used to the ship. Her Devil Fruit can also be a huge help to the crew as a Scout. She's shown that she can create an apparition of herself that can be completely separate from her back when she fought against Usopp during the Thriller Bark Arc. Although it wouldn't be needed, everyone on the ship has some form of role. Now, her joining the crew contradicts with everyone having a set \"goal\" like Nami wanting to make a map of the world, Sanji wanting to find the All Blue and so forth, but I have an interesting question: \"If Vivi, Carrot or Marco joined the crew, what would their goals be?\" I've thought about that for a bit; trying to think of goals for them is a bit odd. Maybe if Marco ever joined, his role would be to protect Luffy?\n\nOverall thoughts?",

Why did Luffy had to specifically mention about ryuo when he used Bajrang gun? About how Hyogoro taught him how to clash without touching.\n\nAlso what's with some conquerors haki coated attacks connecting, but while some are not? Luffy and Kaido had clashed many times with acoc coated attacks but their attacks actually directly landing on each others.\n\nAnd even other characters who use acoc are inconsistent. Yamato (against Kaido) and Zoro's acoc coated attacks directly touch their opponents. \n\nAnd is there a difference in normally coating and specifically using the advanced haki for attack? Kaido described Luffy's g5 as a form which was fully coated in acoc and acoa. He himself was also fully coated. Yet most of their attacks still land directly on their opponent.",

        "text": "Hey all,\nalthough I‚Äôm not fully caught up yet (in the middle of whole-cake rn, so sick), I was wondering on whether you guys think it‚Äôs possible for a devil fruit to be a mix of two separate types. I know the gum-gum fruit has been revealed to be a mythical-zoan type, and katakuri has his mochi fruit which is classified as a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù paramecia, but what if these two devil fruits were so ‚Äúspecial‚Äù because they hold the power of two devil fruit affinities? Luffy has the paramecia aspect of being made of rubber always, not just when he decides to ‚Äútransform‚Äù into frankly any of his gears, and katakuri, similar to luffy in how his body is always mochi, but acts like a logia in the sense that it is hard to land an attack on him and also that he has a near infinite supply of said mochi.\n\nif this were true, or if it were possible, what kind of hybrid devil fruit can you imagine? \nfor example, as far as I‚Äôm aware, there is no logia that acts like a zoan, and no zoan fruit that acts like a logia, so if I were to make a devil fruit along those lines, I would make a hive-hive fruit that lets the user turn into a near infinite swarm of bees, or a plague-plague fruit that lets the user turn into a mischief of rats.\n\nwhat are your thoughts!",

        "text": "\nThe \"Will of D.\" is one of the most fascinating and intriguing mysteries in the world of One Piece. My theory on the origin of the \"Will of D.\" is that it is the manifestation of an ancient curse cast by a deity or dark entity.\n\nAccording to my theory, a long time ago, the world of One Piece was ruled by a powerful empire that exercised tyrannical control over the population. The people of the world, tired of living under the empire's yoke, prayed for a solution and their request was heard by a deity or dark entity, who decided to intervene.\n\nThis deity or dark entity cast a curse on the empire and all those who supported it, with the aim of destroying it and bringing freedom to the world. The curse manifested itself in the form of a genetic alteration, the main effect of which was to occasionally give birth to individuals who would bear the mark of the \"Will of D.\".\n\nThese individuals were destined to destroy the empire and bring freedom to the world. The curse would also have caused the disappearance of the ancient empire, erasing all trace of its existence and allowing the world to recover.\n\nThis would explain why members of the D. family are often associated with rebels and revolutionaries, who clash with the World Government and law enforcement. Additionally, this theory would explain why some members of the D. family seem to have strange powers or a superior resistance capacity compared to other characters in the world of One Piece.\n\nIn summary, my theory argues that the \"Will of D.\" is the result of an ancient curse cast by a deity or dark entity, with the aim of bringing freedom to the world and destroying a tyrannical empire.",
