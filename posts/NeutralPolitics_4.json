        "text": "The People's Republic of China [employ extensive surveillance](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html) mechanisms to suppress dissent and socially engineer Chinese citizens populating mainland China. The Communist Party is currently implementing a social credit system that's designed to function as a financial credit score and as a citizen's [social score](https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-social-credit/) based on his or her political views, the goods and services they purchase and their association with others.  The Public Security Bureau (their national police force) wants an [\"omnipresent, completely connected, always on and fully controllable\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/china-surveillance/552203/) surveillance system implemented throughout the nation.  [China's surveillance state](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/china-surveillance-state-artificial-intelligence) represent the fruit of private enterprise and ingenuity, and the [anti-democratic motivations of a repressive regime](https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/china-and-the-lessons-of-modern-surveillance-technology/). \n\nIn the United States, the situation isn't the same, but privacy advocates still have cause to worry.  According to the Supreme Court, the [third party doctrine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/) dictates that if an individual willfully releases private information to a third party, the government doesn't require a warrant to access said information because their is no expectation of privacy on the individual's part. Nonetheless, ten states have privacy rights outlined in their constitutions, as shown [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-protections-in-state-constitutions.aspx) by the national conference of state legislatures.  The right to privacy, as [currently outlined in the common law](https://www.livescience.com/37398-right-to-privacy.html), also influences abortion policy.\n\nWhat does a fundamental right to privacy entail? Is it public, private, or does sit somewhere in between?  If it is codified in the Constitution, should Congress, the States or both be granted enforcement power?  Why should, or shouldn't, we include a right to privacy in the U.S Constitution?",

Giuliani and Jay A. Sekulow, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Trump was not ordering the inquiry closed but simply expressing his opinion.\n\n&gt; “It’s not a call to action,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it was a sentiment that Mr. Trump and his lawyers have expressed publicly before.\n\n&gt; Mr. Sekulow said: “He doesn’t feel that he has to intervene in the process, nor is he intervening.”\n\n&gt; His lawyers said the president wanted the legal process to play out. “He’s expressing his opinion, but he’s not talking of his special powers he has” as president, Mr. Giuliani said\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nDemocrats claim this is a clear attempt to obstruct justice.\n\nFrom Senator [Chuck Schumer:](https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1024654912385425409)\n\n&gt;The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated.\n\n&gt; This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it.\n\nAnd Senator [Patrick Leahy,](https://twitter.com/SenatorLeahy/status/1024661101466845184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1024661101466845184&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F08%2F01%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-sessions-russia-investigation.html) who merely implied this was obstruction of justice:\n\n&gt; When I was a prosecutor, obstruction of justice was often hard to prove, requiring difficult-to-obtain evidence that the individual’s actions were truly intended to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation.

I will remove it if it’s the wrong place.\n\nI am on mobile, so please forgive any formatting issues.\n\nJust a few minutes ago my friend brought up the new [Religious Liberty Task Force](https://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/regulation/administration/399482-sessions-announces-religious-liberty-task-force%3famp) being created by Jeff Sessions. Based on the few articles I read, it sounds like this was created to help carry out a memo from last October and is intended to work on improving religious freedoms and rights. However, I am having difficulty understanding exactly what the goal of this Task Force is.\n\nEvery article I’ve read is either as basic as every other article, only repeating the same info, or is heavily spun to a political agenda. Because of this, I am confused. Who is the Task Force meant to help? How much time, money and resources is this going to consume? Is this able to help all religious groups, or is it built in a way that it can be heavily slanted in favor of one group if they decide to do that?\n\nI personally don’t think I care either way for it to exist or not, so I’m not trying to come off as pro or anti task force. I’m just genuinely curious about the details of this and what exactly is going on.\n\nThanks in advanced!",

        "text": "**EDIT:** Thanks to everyone for your feedback. As a result of this discussion, we've extended the \"sole source\" restriction to tweets (they may not be the only source in a submission) and we will be more vigilant about enforcing the prohibition on submissions that are purely requests for fact-checking.\n\n---------\n\nDear users,\n\nAs part of our recent [revisions to the rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/923ne7/meta_updates_to_the_rules_in_rneutralpolitics/) we instituted a new policy about the use of tweets as a source in submissions:\n\n&gt; Tweets may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder\n\n\nA few days later, we received a submission using a [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1023664624259014656) as its lone source and asking for evidence to support the assertion therein. We [approved it,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/932fk5/president_trump_decried_the_mueller_investigation/\n) because it didn't seem to violate any of the [submission rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) However, some users in the thread questioned the validity of that source. \n\nWe're reaching out to the users to ask for feedback on whether a source like the tweet in question should be considered valid in submissions on r/NeutralPolitics. Although this issue most frequently comes up around tweets by President Trump, it really applies to any public figure who makes unsubstantiated claims in any medium.\n\nWhat do you all think? If the wording of the rule should change, how would you suggest we change it?\n\nA few notes:\n\n* We're not discussing the [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) here. Those are different.\n* The [source guidelines section](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) of the rules has a \"sole source\" restriction for Wikipedia articles, opinion pieces, and audio/video clips, but not for tweets. A quick fix for a post like the one in question would be to add tweets to the list of source types that may not be used as a sole source in submissions. But that would not address the larger issue of unsubstantiated claims by people in positions of authority.\n* Submission Rule E prohibits \"requests for fact-checking,\" which the submission above arguably is, so it's possible it shouldn't have been approved in the first place.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback. Thanks in advance.\n\n— r/NeutralPolitics mod team\n",
