        "text": "So me, our baby and my fiancé just moved into my aunts house about a month ago due to family issues, everything has been smooth while staying here so far except a few things. So this place is a old log cabin from 1903 I believe is what my aunt says and it’s out in missouri in the middle of nowhere. Well, at first it was just all the stories my uncle would tell about all the weird shit that happens out here, then things started happening. One morning my uncle was getting ready for work and he’s a truck driver so he leaves early Monday morning and doesn’t come back until Friday night usually, well he calls my aunt and tells her that when he was leaving for work he saw a wolf the size of his pick up truck. Wolf isn’t too much of a problem right? Well it is to us because it’s been lurking around our house lately and will not stop. Only shows itself early morning and howls so loud at night it wakes us up, also we have dogs here and the dogs aren’t dead. If this wolf is so big and everything why hasn’t it killed the dog’s? It only wants to get really close to the house and howl very very loud. The dogs don’t bark or act like they’re even bothered. Can someone please tell me what this is. I’m hearing noises outside rn while I’m typing this.",

Maybe about a few weeks after I find another one in a completely different part of my house where my dogs can't reach and arent allowed in. A few weeks later the same thing happens but I find it on a table in the kitchen. My dogs arent allowed there. And right now I just found another carrot in my mom's room in her drawer. My dog has never been upstairs, in mom's room or my room. I am going crazy, I dont know what it means, I dont have siblings, its just me and my mom in the whole house, what does it mean because im tired of finding carrots. Also they are all rotten old carrots. Please, what could this mean?",

I said good morning again, and once more no answer. \n\nA little freaked out, I sat up and noticed a little boy sitting on my bedroom floor playing with a train set.\n\nI started to really get scared and tried to get my dad’s attention, he was still standing at the window half- turned towards me. Then he vanished- literally just vanished. And so did the boy. Then my dad reappeared, he was sort of drifting around the room doing stuff like reading or lying down. Never once spoke, eventually vanishing again after some time. I got up to make sure I wasn’t dreaming, checked the door and curtains.\n\nAfter some time I went back to bed. I eventually fell asleep only to have nightmares. My mom came into my room (this time for real) asking why the curtains were open. I told her the story and she reminded me my dad was on a business trip.",

        "text": "I don't know if these are paranormal experiences but I hope to find answers to these weird experiences that I have.\n\nIt all started when I was 7 years old, me and my sister (were both girls) lived in our grandmother's house at that time. Our parents are very busy with their jobs, so they decided to leave us to our grandmother for a year. Everything went normal until school starts. When I was at that age I used to have a \"special place\". This \"special place\" that I have is an abandoned room with an airplane inside. It's like a house but it's exterior is shape like an airplane. It is located at the top floor of our school. I always remember that every time I need to do something I would go there immediately. That place also plays a huge part of my childhood because I spent many hours in that place. One year later, we live again with our parents. Until 5 years later, we decided to visit our grandmother for her birthday and I asked my dad if I can visit my old school and he said yes. I was so excited on my way there as I was looking forward to what my \"special place\" looks like now. When I arrived at the school gate, I asked the guard if I can enter and he agreed. I was confused when I saw my school it was a one story building (it means no stairs) so I asked the guard what happened to the school why did it change and he look at me confused too and said that it was like that all along. I went home disappointed and then I realize that it can't be true as I still remember the exhaustion that I got just to get there and the look of the stairs on the way there. Until now I still have this question on where did I actually went.\n\nAnother experience that I have is when I was 9 years old, so I was playing on my own in our garage but I can see the road outside. Outside I saw 2 girls running and they seem having fun. I told them not to play on the road as cars are passing by. But they seem to ignore my warning and seconds later a car came super fast that it hit the 2 girls, I saw their body swimming in their own blood. I immediately scream and when my mom asked what's wrong I pointed at the road to where the body was but it wasn't there. No dead body no blood just a road.\n\nThird experience is when I was 16 so we moved to a two story apartment. Because of our dad's work my dad usually drives for at least 1 hour just to get to his work so we decided to moved to another place so it can be convenient for him. Instead of 1 hour drive it narrows down to 15 minutes. The apartment is triplex house with 2 rooms each house. We got the right side of the apartment and next to our right is a hospital. Only me and my dad lives in that house because my mom works abroad while my sister lives in dormitory. I used one of the rooms and when I first slept at that room I hear noises coming from the hospital like a sound of hammer when it hits the nail. At first I ignored it thinking that they must be repairing something, but it happened almost every night then I got curious and asked myself \"why do they have to do that at night and not at day?\" Then one night as I was sleeping already used to the sound of the hammer I feel someone touch my leg so in instinct I kick the person but I immediately open my eyes and notice a strange smell like a cigarette but no one was there it can't be my dad as he was old already so he can't run fast and also my door is locked and I put a chair behind the door so if he enters my room the chair will move but it did not.\n\nFourth experience is at the same place (the apartment) so my sister have this nickname for me that only she used so one day I heard my \"sister\" called me upstairs so I went then I realized that my sister was not there. This also happens to my dad as he said that he heard me from my room but in truth I was in school at that time. Also to my sister when she decided to spend weekends with us that she heard someone knocking at her door (the room next to my room) but it wasn't us because me and my dad are both downstairs and we can't run fast to prank her like that.\n\nLatest experience that I have was last night, I was now 23 years old, after the experience that I have in my room I decided to just sleep on the sofa downstairs with my dad (he has his own bed). So they said that dogs can see ghost and at first I don't usually believe that. But lately for a week, I notice something strange I always saw dogs gathering infront of our apartment and bark endlessly at around 2:50 am to 3:10 am something. I would wake up because of that noise and my bed was near the entrance so the sound of their bark was too loud for me. Last night before I sleep I scroll through my facebook and then I went to sleep afterwards. At around 3:00 am I heard the dog's bark and I found myself wrap in blanket and I noticed that I was shivering in cold like it was not normal it felt like I was put in freezer with no clothes on and any moment I can be frozen. Then I realized that I was not fully awake only a \"part of me\" was awake. Moments later I felt someone lie down next to me. I'm facing the wall every time I sleep I feel comfortable that way, so that person was behind me I felt that someone was there because the sofa moves for a bit. At first I check if it was my dad but it wasn't him as he was peacefully sleeping below (the sofa that I slept in and his bed are in L-shape position) so I can see him. So I decided to turn to other side to know who or what it was but my body won't move as if something is preventing me to move. Next thing I knew is that the person is squeezing my body and I felt his hand on my mouth like suffocating me and the sofa was moving like there was an earthquake but it wasn't because it feels like only me is noticing the movement that's when I realized that only the sofa was moving. I don't see it but I definitely felt its touch. I try to fight as I was in need for air but it seems like the more I resist the more it was squeezing me and the movement was faster than before. After a few seconds I try to move again and I succeed but it felt strange like I feel like I'm moving but at the same time I don't. The feeling that a \"part of me\" was moving but my actual body isn't. Then I got scared and thought that if I move that \"part of me\" (leave my physical body) I will not return to my body so I decided to just stay like that (how my physical body is positioned) and wait for the movement to stop and force myself to sleep. I don't know how long does the shaking went as I force my eyes shut and sleep let it finish what it had to do. When I woke up (3 hours later because of the alarm) I felt the need for air and my body was exhausted because of what happened. So far this was the most extreme that happened to me.\n\nWhat do you think am I being haunted or something?",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a small shop in the heart of Mexico that sold handmade crafts and trinkets. The owner, Rosa, had inherited the shop from her grandmother and had been running it for many years. Despite its small size, the shop was known for its unique and beautiful items.\n\nOne day, Rosa began to notice strange occurrences in the shop. Items would move on their own, doors would open and close by themselves, and she would hear whispers in a language she didn't understand. At first, Rosa thought she was just imagining things, but as the occurrences became more frequent and intense, she began to suspect that there was something paranormal at play.\n\nOne night, Rosa decided to stay in the shop to try and uncover the source of the disturbances. As she sat in her chair, she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. When she turned to look, she saw a group of small, mischievous-looking creatures darting around the shop. They were dressed in colorful clothing and had pointed ears that resembled those of elves from fairy tales.\n\nRosa couldn't believe her eyes. She had heard stories of elves and fairies from her grandmother, but she had never believed they were real. The creatures seemed to be having a great time, giggling and playing with the shop's items as if they were toys.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Rosa began to learn more about the elves that had taken up residence in her shop. She discovered that they were mischievous, but not malicious, and enjoyed playing pranks on each other and the shop's visitors. They were also incredibly skilled artisans, and would often create small, intricate crafts that would mysteriously appear in the shop's display cases overnight.\n\nDespite her initial fear, Rosa came to love the elves and their antics. She even began to leave out small treats for them, which they would happily accept in exchange for their crafts. The shop became a popular destination for tourists who heard about the elves, and business boomed.\n\nYears went by, and Rosa grew old. She eventually passed the shop down to her own granddaughter, along with the secret of the elves who lived there. To this day, the elves still play and create in the shop, bringing joy to all who visit.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/113l5dy/found_this_sub_wanted_to_share_my_experiences/",
        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI recently found this sub and I got the urge open up about some of my own encounters. For context, I am in my early 30s now, and much of this happened between the ages of 10-14 . All of it started shortly after my family and I moved to a new home &amp; town. The house we moved into was fairly new construction at the time, and I don't believe there was anything interesting about the land it was built on.\n\nWithin a couple months of moving in, I had my first experience with sleep paralysis. I had gone to bed late that night. Roughly 5 minutes after shutting the lights off and closing my eyes, I felt a cold presence touching my chest. I opened my eyes and saw nothing. Naturally, I was creeped out and ran into my parents room for comfort. My mom convinced me it was a bad dream and that I should go back to bed, which I did. Immediately after closing my eyes again, I felt the same thing, except this time moving through the center of my chest with force. That feeling then expanded throughout my torso. Upon opening my eyes I realized I could not move or speak. At this point I could feel something watching me directly to the right of the bed. I laid there for maybe 5-10 minutes trying to scream before regaining the ability to move. As soon as I could, I jumped up and ran back into my parents room. Needless to say I slept next to them that night.\n\nLucky for me, I've only had to experience sleep paralysis a couple of times in my life. There were several other odd encounters to follow though. A couple months after that, at night, is when I had my next experience. My grandmother was watching my brother and me that evening. She was on the first floor with my brother. I was on the second floor, and from my window looking down into into my back yard (the house borders a small forest / river) I saw a bright white figure walking from one end to the other. It looked like a fully grown man, but glowing, and I never really saw a face. I was a bit freaked out at the sight of this, so I ducked to ensure whatever it was did not see me. I briefly peeked out the window a couple seconds after and it was gone. I ran downstairs immediately to find both my grandmother and my brother in the same room. No one that I know of was in the back yard at the time.\n\nThese experiences peaked my interest in the paranormal. Roughly a few months after that, I convinced my mom to buy me a ouija board. I then convinced our baby sitter, who was a few years older than me, to use it with my brother while my parents were out of the house. We turned off all the lights and lit a couple candles and tried to talk to the dead. At the time I was skeptical and I assumed our babysitter was the one manipulating the planchette, but it was moving and responding to our questions. We eventually decided we were done with it, and put the board away. Again, I kind of laughed this one off... Thinking back on it, the frequency of these encounters went way up after this experience.\n\nThe fact is that I never really felt alone in this house, especially when I was the only one home. Fast forward to middle school... I was usually the first one home and would remain home alone for a couple of hours every day. I generally spent most of my time in the basement, where the TV, video game console &amp; computer were. During this time, I would regularly hear kitchen cabinets slamming shut (they weren't open to begin with) and dining room chairs being dragged across the floor.. and I always felt as though there was something watching. I did at times wonder if some of this was in my head, only for the thoughts to be validated by both my brother, and a few friends that would come over at various intervals.\n\nThere was another standalone event around the same time where my brother and I were playing games in his room. We were both sitting on his bed, and to my right was the door to the hallway, which was wide open. The lights were off in the bedroom and there was some tertiary lighting coming from the hallway. Out of my peripheral view was again a fully formed person (white figure) that appeared to walk past the doorway out in the hallway, and as I turned my head right, my brother (to my left) sneezed and blood came pouring out of his nose. Again, I saw just enough to be creeped out, but not enough to fully validate exactly what I saw.\n\nThere were a few other events to follow... more or less the same as some of the stuff described above. All of this came to a head one night, and this is also where I saw some of the most vivid stuff to date. I was 13, and my best friend was sleeping over. It was Friday night and we were the only ones in the house at that point. We were on the second floor playing video games when all of a sudden we heard the cabinet doors slamming &amp; the chairs moving. I was use to it by now, but my friend got a bit freaked out and asked what it was. I am paraphrasing, but I said something to the effect of, \"its those f'ing ghosts again. f those ghosts.\" This is when things got weird for us...\n\nShortly after that, my TV turned off. The room became very cold, and it was almost like the air became heavy, and it took much more energy to get up and move around. we booked it from my room and went downstairs to the first floor. We calmed down afterwards and figured we had overreacted to what was probably an odd coincidence. We then decided to go back upstairs to play video games. As we were walking up, it became very cold and we began feeling weighed down again. We ignored this as again, it was all in our heads. We got to my room and turned the TV on along with the video games. After about a minute or two, the same thing happened where the TV turned off... only this time I saw what looked like a floating orb or two out of the corner of my eye. We again ran downstairs.\n\nLike an idiot, I tried going upstairs a third time. Same cold &amp; heaviness as before..... This time as I approached the top of the stairs, I looked into my parents room from the hallway (door was open, lights were off) and to the right of their bed I saw an all white figure standing with no torso or head. I again booked it downstairs.\n\nAt this point, we went into full on paranoia mode. I tried calling my parents... no answer. We were stuck at home, feeling terrorized and not sure when the adults were coming back. At some point we actually started chanting / praying out of desperation.... which I think made things worse because the air on the first floor became very heavy and we felt the cold rush again. I also started to see the same small orbs fly into the room from upstairs, only this time directly in my field of view. \n\nThis brought my anxiety to the next level and I finally yelled out and apologized for saying what I said earlier.. and in a very candid way, I pleaded with the spirits to leave me alone pointing out that we both live here, and that I would not mess with them going forward if they did not mess with me. As I was apologizing, I saw 2 or 3 more of those small orbs and one much larger, dark one (purple and/or black) all come into the room and just hang there for more than a few seconds. What's odd is after my apology, the orbs dissipated and the air cleared up. Coincidentally, my mom came home maybe 20 minutes after that whole thing ended, and all went back to normal, as if nothing happened.\n\nI have not seen anything since then. The noises we regularly heard on the first floor continued, although they didn't bother me much at that point. I do think my friend may have been a bit traumatized from that experience though... he claimed he felt he was being watched for a good while after that night.... uffff.\n\nI'd be interested to hear some of your thoughts. Some of this stuff was downright terrifying in the moment, and I'd love to understand what I was dealing with.\n\nThanks for listening!",

And today we found a cat food trail in the house kitchen, we were all day drawing in the kitchen (that’s were we have all the desks to draw) and there were no croquettes there. And when we were about to leave we found a little trail of 6 cat croquettes perfectly alined and spaced between them. \nWe started investigating and all dictates that we share house with a type of Mexican Elf called Aluxes (Mayan elf), which is a type of elf who can’t be kicked out or removed from the house, it was his house before than our shop. They will remain for ever in that house, the only thing we can do is make them our friends by giving them offerings, being friendly and having a good vibe at the shop.\nNow all things that happened before have sense.\n\nPd: I have a photo of the trail but don’t know how to post it with my text.",

As soon as she was gone creepy stuff started happening. I was hearing banging on the shed next to our house at night, waking up randomly at 1-2 am petrified. Other weird things that I couldn’t explain. As soon as my husband started slowly moving back in again it’s all dissipated. I’m wondering if she’s like a guardian angel genuinely. She’s EXTREMELY protective (another dog was running at my kids once growling and she chased the dog and boy a chunk out of his face) if she hears my kids crying she will immediately look to comfort them,  I know when she’s around I just feel 100 times more at ease. She patrols the house at night every so often. It could literally just be all in my head 🤷🏻‍♀️ I just thought it would be worth sharing",

        "text": "A while ago, I had an **extremely** vivid, partially lucid dream that kept me terrified in bed for hours after waking up. Most of my dreams, even the most odd ones, will eventually be forgotten, or at least the more minute details will fade. This specific one, however, has remained as clear, detailed, and ominous as the moment it was dreamt (a few years ago). I will tell you the entirety of the dream and describe the creature as best I can. Though admittedly, it is difficult, as it is incredibly odd.\n\nIt begins as a lucid dream; I am talking with my mother, helping with the gardening, and actively aware that I am making the decisions, though I do not state this out loud. We live in the Piney Woods, so the \"back yard\" was about 48 acres of uncleared trees/woods. I remember it being bright outside (as if there were no clouds at high noon), and at this point, the woods looked normal; you can see maybe 20 feet inside the tree line before it gets too dense.\n\nMy mother calls me around the side of the house to look at something in the corner of the porch. There is a puppy, a slick golden retriever (maybe 3 months old) with beautiful honey-brown eyes. I am immediately taken with this puppy; I can physically feel the giddiness bubbling up in my chest. Turning to my mother to show her my excitement and probably ask if we could keep him (it?), *I take my eyes off the puppy.* \n\nWhen I turn back, the puppy is larger, almost adult size but not quite, and how has bright blue eyes. I bend down to let him lick my face and give him lots of love, hoping he'd take a liking to me. At this point, the dream is no longer lucid, though I am too wrapped up in this dog to take any notice. I stand up to ask my mother why there would be a dog here, especially one so well-groomed and seemingly a \"family-dog.\" *I took my eyes off him again*. When I turn back for the third time, the dog is now grey (think \"blue pitbull\" gray) but still looks like a slick-coated golden retriever with the same blue eyes. \n\nThis finally stirs some alarm in me; I am confused and look back to my mother, *taking my eyes off it for a third time.* When I look back, the dog is now sitting up on its hind legs. Its legs and body are normal, but its feet, hands, and face are distorted. Its paws were now humanoid, feet too long for a dog, hands long, thin, and ended in huge claws. Focusing on its face, it smiled, widening its now too-large eyes and revealing far too many pointed teeth. It extends a hand towards me, and I have no choice; I am no longer lucid but beginning to panic. \n\nAs it begins to shuffle along the porch, I realize it wants to take me into the woods. I don't know how I knew this, it was a strong gut feeling, and I knew it would mean something horrible. I could no longer see into the woods; the sunlight hits the front of the trees, but the light hits nothing else. It is all black. The fear I felt in my body as the creature kept smiling, kept looking into my eyes, was indescribably visceral. \n\nThat was when I woke up. I was sweating, breathing hard, and flailing as I still tried to get away from this creature. I was home alone and most certainly had important things to do, but I was rooted to the bed, backed up into the corner. I stayed that way until the feeling left. I have felt many versions of fear, but so far, none have stacked up. Not the kind of panic you feel when looking at the ground from several stories up, not the kind you feel when you see a shadow in the corner of your dark bedroom. It was the innate, primal sense of fear when your brain's sole purpose is survival; no thoughts other than ***danger, danger, danger...***\n\nSo, if this describes anything you know of, and I mean anything AT ALL, please let me know. It may just be a weird dream/nightmare, but I don't think that level of fear is normal. It is not a state your brain likes to be in, so I don't see why it would even \"test the reaction.\" I haven't had any similar dreams since, and I hope writing this doesn't incite one. \n\nI appreciate literally every and any information you can provide. THANKS!",

I have had two \"past life\" dreams and one \"future life\" dream (that came true). The first one doesn't look perfect but it gives the gist of my watching my husband die during the 1830's. In the second dream I am living in the Netherlands and my village is burning - it's the middle ages and I am running with my two children, a boy and a girl. The third dream I am watching a woman in front of black cemetery gates who introduces herself as my mother-in-law (before I was married). It began raining coins. She would eventually be buried in a cemetery with black gates and I inherited some of her wealth. She was very good to me.  Imgur images in comments.",

I shared a room with my brother at the time and this sent us both sprinting out of the room in fear. \n\n2. One night at 4am (I used to stay up very late) I noticed a vase near the edge of the kitchen top. To ensure no one accidentally knocked it over I pushed it to the back of the kitchen top against the wall (a good 3/4 of a meter distance). Later while watching TV, I very clearly hear the vase slide across the kitchen top followed by it falling onto the ground and smashing. I was the only person awake in the house. \n\n3. Someone came round to replace the wallpaper in the house. The man’s name was Jeff. The very first patch of wallpaper that he tore off the wall revealed his name written underneath in red ink. He refused to do the job and left. \n\n4. My dog will absolutely refuse to go upstairs in that house whenever we visit my mum (who still lives in the house). I have carried her upstairs before in the house and she will tremble with fear and run downstairs as soon as I put her down. She has no issue running upstairs in my house, my in-laws house, or my fathers house. \n\nMore than happy to answer questions if you have any!",

        "text": "Hello everyone. Over the past month I’ve been going over to my grandparents house to gather their mail and organize it whilst they are away in another state. I was told that  the doorbell goes off randomly and there are other strange sounds that happen before they left. The first week to two weeks go by fine with the only strange things that happen are the doorbell going off once every so often. I decided to have friends over there one night (My grandparents encouraged me to do so) where everything seemed fine, when everyone left I locked the doors and left through the garage. Weeks three to four is where things started to get a little weird. Everyone week I go around and check the house to make sure everything is okay. However when I’m downstairs I’ve been hearing creeking from the wood floor upstairs along with a few other weird sounds. Eventually my mom went over to check how things were going and the side door was unlocked….. I made sure all doors were locked. Yesterday I went over, I was standing in the kitchen when the doorbell went off 7 times in a row rapidly. It sounded like someone could have actually been at the door so I peeked around the wall and there was no one. Still facing the door I slowly crept back when it went off again 7 times rapidly. I left the house immediately. Today I went over with my brother. When I finished putting the mail away I walked into the kitchen and heard the *ding* of the doorbell and thought things had gone back to normal with the just one ding. However after about a second it went off again and started getting faster and faster. We ran out of that house so fast. On our drive home my steering wheel became jerky and my engine started smoking. Strange things are happening…. Does anyone have an explanation for the doorbell? In a few days I’m going to do my weekly check of the house, I make sure to check the knives in their knife block every day just in case there is a person there and they may try something. Any explanations or similar experiences?",

        "text": "The house was built in 1922, unsure exactly of all of its past history. When I was little I had often times had these dreams where I would wander through my house in the night time, trying to find something or perhaps someone. The dream would always end when I find the tall dark figure, nothing but a silhouette standing in the middle of my kitchen, exposed by the overhead light over the kitchen sink that hadn’t even worked for years before. It was always on in that dream though. I would wake up sometimes hearing these voices, not angry or of any emotional but usually just 2-3 voices talking mid sentence of audible English words that were distinguishable but didn’t make sense of much really. Sometimes I would even wake up frozen, like I couldn’t breath or move but simply lay there with my eyes wide open for a few seconds while still hearing the voices speak briefly.\n\nMy mother has always experienced things as well as my older sister, my mom hearing a jingle/eerie hymn coming from the back of the refrigerator (or maybe the pantry?) late at night sometimes. Things would turn on, or off. The year was 2001 (I was just 8 years old) one night my mother woke up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. She was frozen in her steps in the hall when greeted by a deep, hollow and loud voice right in front of her, that of a man say slowly and forced out “don’t worry, everything will be alright” she opened the lights looked around and saw nothing. It was a snowy night when she took a look outside, no fresh footprints were seen around the home. She woke my dad up to go investigate the voice, but my dad didn’t believe in ghosts or anything of the sort. He came into my room and grabbed my wooden baseball bat, and it woke me up. I worried for my dad and what was happening, and wanted to go downstairs. I hadn’t heard the voice in the hall, I just stayed awake and listened but eventually fallen back asleep. I only heard of this story later on when I was older, and had finally knew why my dad came in for my bat. My dad found nothing out of the ordinary. My moms father had passed away that previous year of a heart attack, and my dad mother was suffering and dying of cancer at this time. My mom seems to think that the message was in reference to those events. Throughout the years my mom and sister would experience most of which was lights on and off, and sometimes an eerie jingle from the kitchen at night.\n\nFast forward to 2018, my parents are divorced and the house has been vacant for two years now just to be heated during winter months. My wife and I decide to move in to rent from my dad since we were tired of the apartment living. The first night I moved in and was unpacking I immediately felt a strong presence and didn’t feel like being there, almost like unwelcoming and being watched. I couldn’t shake the feeling, as my wife was working overnights at the coffee shop and I was alone. The next day is when it started to all happen again. I got up for my morning shift at 4:30 and was brushing my teeth just in the other room. My wife woke up to a voice that said “earl”. She asked me if I had said it and I in fact didn’t, I was brushing my teeth at the time. I thought to myself “here we go again” but I didn’t tell her that. The next morning my wife was wide awake watching Netflix on her phone. 4:15 comes around, I snooze the phone. Not long after we hear this bizarre jingle/hymn at the foot of the bed for like 8-10 seconds. It was long enough for her to shake me and say my name and I still heard it. It kind of reminded me of Take Me Out To The Ball Game from one of those little teddy bears or something. So terrified we both threw the lights on and searched the room, there was nothing but boxes of clothes in our room and nothing that could have possibly made that sound. We got the house blessed the next day and we hadn’t experienced anything too far out after that. Occasionally a light would work itself or the stove range fan would turn on by itself (it didn’t work when we tried it). \n\nThere was also another time where me and my wife were both standing right next to each other and I was getting a phon call from her cell, but she was using her phone and it didn’t even show she was calling me. I was too afraid to pick up, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I did pick up.\n\nLater on we got a home and my sister moved in and had one night experienced a disembodied voice at the end of her bed, just whistling the tune to the tv show she had just finished watching. She had also taken videos and seen several orbs just floating around.\n\nI just asked her the other day if she’s experienced anything lately, and she says that she doesn’t anymore. Her and her boyfriend are in a good and happy place in life at the moment and she seems to think that could be why she isn’t experiencing weird things anymore. She also told me she thought that the house was some sort of portal where many spirits would come through. I’m not sure what to think or believe, but after me and my wife both hearing that hymn it def must be something. \n\nHave any of these events ever happened to you?? What do they all mean????",

It was around 8pm and I was in my bedroom with my dog. I was sitting on my bed listening to music using headphones and sketching out a tattoo design I was planning on getting.\n\nI barely noticed anything if it wasn’t for my dog. I looked over by my closet and saw what I can only describe as an almost spherical cloudy white mist either forming or coming out of the closet threshold while the door was closed.\n\nI sat calmly observing this, as I previously have had other sort of encounters, so this was more intriguing to me than anything. What really surprised me was my pitbull, who isn’t afraid of anything, noticed it just before me and snapped her head towards it from a fully relaxed state, she may well of been sleeping. She then proceeds to put her ears back, hair goes up, and she begins leaning into me to create distance from this thing. She quickly got up, hopped off the bed, and ran out of the room. My big tough pit, eh?\n\nBy now this cloud has made its way alongside my bed, still keeping its form. I still had my headphones in so I can’t say whether or not there was an audible sound coming from it. Just before it got up next to me it changed direction and traveled through the wall which lead outside.\n\nA very strange encounter indeed, yet not too surprising.",

        "text": "My experience with ghosts happened about 10 years ago when I was in my early 40's. I was at my parents house with my family visiting for holiday. When we visit my parents we stay in one of the upstairs rooms. At the time I did not believe in ghosts and really never put much thought into it. \n\nSo we are going to sleep in the room we always stay in and I was having a hard time sleeping so I went to another room so I would not wake my wife with the tossing and turning. As I am laying there trying to sleep I hear distinct footsteps on the carpeted floor. It then got very cold and I am starting to panic a bit. I just lay there frozen as I could feel someone standing right next to me. Then \"he\" starts pulling on the sheets!(I know it was a \"he\" because I got to know him a bit) So I dart across the hall back into the bed where my wife is sleeping and lay there freaking out. Then I am visited by another ghost. This time it was a young girl who basically wanted to play. She would not walk like the guy. She floated in and I knew she was in the room when it got cold. And when she would show up she would drop invisible pellets on my face. It did not feel like rain drops more like little bubbles. \n\nSo then I was all of a sudden dealing with two freaking ghosts. And basically these ghosts were just a pain in the ass. They were constantly messing with me. The guy was the worst. He was constantly screwing with me. He would come into the room the same way. Slow walk on the carpet and it would always get cold. His favorite thing to do was come up and get right beside me and blow real hard into my ear. And pulling on the sheets. He was a jerk and just wanted to mess with me. The young girl and the guy were always together but visited me separately. I dont think the guy was her dad but he acted like it. We stayed at my parents for three nights on this trip and I am trying to fight through these ghosts messing with me. I was very happy to get the hell out of there and leave the ghosts behind. We were about an hour or so on our drive back when I realized the freaking ghosts were in the car with us. So for the next 2 weeks I had the ghosts with me at my house. These ghosts really just wanted to mess with you. And try to make you look as crazy as possible. I had not told my wife about the ghosts until we were driving back home. My wife could not feel or hear the ghosts although I would tell her every time they would come around. It was always the same thing. When they would show up I was immediately hit with cold air. We would be sitting on the couch and I would tell her that the ghosts were right beside me blowing in my ear. Or scratching on the surface where my head was. Just stuff to make you crazy. They would not touch or hurt me. They did not talk. There was never any reference to religion. The guy was a smoker as when he would breathe on me you could smell it. The little girl just liked to play and sing. She was proud of how she could sing and you could tell the guy was proud of her too. To make a long story shorter I will just say how you get rid of ghosts. At first I took a biblical path to try and get rid of them. Lots of prayer. But like I said religion played no part of this. So ultimately I got rid of them because I ignored them. I had to act like I did not know they were there and just ignore them. After a few days of ignoring them and acting like they were not there they left. I would say they were with me for about 10 days. \n\nAs mentioned this all happened about 10 years ago but I remember it like it was yesterday. I am still shaking my head in disbelief that it happened to me.",

We brushed that stuff off because neither of us believe, but today’s event i truly cannot for the life of me explain. In the voice message there was a loud noise, almost as if a door was opening, it was so loud the only way it could’ve been picked up was if my boyfriend held his microphone directly up to a door, he did not hear this in real life whilst recording nor was he opening anything, he also lives alone, was not watching tv/playing music. Then as he was speaking in the background we could hear a literal woman’s voice followed by a man answering and then almost as if a group of people was talking? None of it was audible to make out the words but i swear to god it was literal people talking, then two knocks. Please can some tech wizzes debunk this because I have never been more terrified or confused, especially since the activity spikes whenever he talks to me via calls/messages and ever since i entered his life…",

The nose looks like a lizard or something off (it's hard to describe but it's not his nose). The mouth looks really scary, like really long on both sides like the joker. But not smiling. And huge dark lips. The mouth is huge in general and long. His chin too is extra bulky and weird. \n\nAlso there is no movement in the photo, or anything that could distort it. \n\nAnother thing is my son is OBSESSED with drawing monsters/creepy entities pretty much his entire life. He used to always do this \"demon voice\" thing but I thought he was just playing a game or something, but it got so constant it scared me so I told him to stop, because it was all the time. I have thrown out a lot of his creepy photos because they were giving me nightmares.\n\nHe stopped doing that, and stopped drawing the creepy pictures, but now the photo from our camera is scaring me.

        "text": "I received my haunted doll yesterday afternoon, and wanted to toss up a little update. She arrived with a small amount of damage to her shoes (the soles were falling off, too much walking around maybe?) So I made the repairs and sought to find the perfect place to put her. \n\nShe arrived smelling strongly of Gain laundry detergent, like she was drenched in it. \n\nMy dog was the first unusual thing that I noticed. For backstory on my dog: Bella, a very good girl, is extremely protective and vocal about it. If she is nervous, she will bark, growl or whine. She also LOVES  babies. Any babies. When we got our most recent kitten (abandoned too early and sick) Bella slept outside the box and alerted us at any cries.\n\nAs soon as I opened the box, she came over to sniff. And then she wouldn't leave. While I made the repair, she sat and watched. She followed me around looking for the perfect place to put the doll, and she sat/laid down outside of my bedroom door when I finally chose a shelf in my room for her. She laid there a while, instead of on her super comfy favorite dog bed that she usually won't leave. \n\nHer behavior definitely reminded me of when we bring a baby into our house, instead of something threatening. \n\nOther than that, it was quiet. \n\nAdding the original auction listing for reference and will update when something else happens. \n\n\n\n\n\nHaunted  Paranormal 16\"  Porcelain doll - Queen -  very positive, happy uplifting. A Mary Jane Castle Original, exclusive design by Mary Jane Emmert - she is a sturdy made doll, in original box with certificate. The name of owner is crossed out though.\n\nThis beautiful girl was purchased at an antique shop in Pittsburgh, Pa. On a road trip visiting family in Allison park, we love to take advantage of stopping in shops along the way. A cute shop, overstuffed with items and as we tried scanning what they had, came across her behind other dolls on a shelf. Was like she sent some type of signals to make us find her. For the amount they had, we didnt even get to look through half, but was led right to her. she was the only one we bought the entire trip, but having her along for the ride, was like we did have another person with us. A presence could be felt.\n\nAfter returning home, the first evening we set her in our dining room, we didnt experience too much out of the ordinary. The atmosphere however seemed to lighten in mood. The smell of flowers filled our dining room where she stood and our cats spent the evening in the room with her. Our dogs, yes, we find it happens a lot with good spirits but our cats only last so long before they go on their way. Queen for some reason was different, one of the few they liked.  When we came down the next morning, the smell of flowers was strong, like roses and lillys .Being a sensitive, she seemed like a very happy caring person and although she didnt perform anything noticeable overnight, we both knew, we could feel each others presence and our cats were still laying on the table near her.We never got a name from her, so have addressed her as Queen and she has responded from the beginning.\n\nThat evening when we started to communicate. Our equipment immediately started spiking. The atmosphere in the room was calm and relaxed and the faint smell of flowers was still there. Our K2 kept spiking from one green to red and the mel meter rose up steadily until it leveled off at 1.1. The air got colder around us and our dogs ended up sitting next to us at the table alert as if they were also listening to someone we didnt see. We had to put our cats in a locked bedroom, since they decided they werent moving and kept laying on our equipment to be close to her. We asked her if she liked our home and our pets. We got what sounded like \" Very much\" through the spirit box. Didnt respond vocally so we turned spirit box off. Asking yes and no questions with the k2, we learned that yes she was a woman, she was married, she was from the Pittsburgh area, died in the early 2000's, was in her 40's, had 2 children and yes 3 cats. Through our night vision screen, we caught an orb come out of the doll and as it hovered above her, seemed to change into a white mist anomaly . We talked almost 2 hours the first night , such a sweet loving woman and after another half hour of no responses we started to turn everything off. As we turned the equipment off, in our night vision screen, we could see yet another mist anomaly form above her and slowly dimmed out. We thanked her for her last interaction and as we put everything away, the faint flower smell seemed to disappear. Was as if her energy seemed to be drained after interacting for so long. We have left her among us since. We do still have to watch when the cats want to lay next to her where we keep her, seems they love her company. Nothing but positivity, love and light from her.\nPlease note, as some have questioned a spirit not interacting with them in items they have purchased from other sellers, spirits have their own personalities, sometimes it does take them a day or two or even longer to adjust to their new surroundings. They dont do parlor tricks and if they choose to hold off on interacting, it is their right to do so. They Do Not perform on command. They should be treated with the respect they deserve and patience because in some cases it was not their choice or preference to stay among us.\nI do start my bidding at just above the cost of what I paid for my items, as to cover the costs of selling. I dont believe in hiking them up, the bidding is your decision and rehoming the items is my goal.If for some reason payment cant be made within the first 3 days, please contact me to let me know, otherwise I assume you have changed your mind and  I will relist the item\n\nOur family has been doing paranormal investigations for 14 years. From Eastern State Prison, White Hill Mansion, NJ.,  Salem Ma, Pennhurst Asylum,  Gettysburgh Pa plus many more locations. We’ve collected many haunted items over the last 10 yrs. and at this point although I personally feel an attachment to them, we need to make room for some of our newer acquisitions. I’ll hope they are going to a good new home with someone who will treat them with the respect they deserve.\n\nPer eBay policy I can’t guarantee paranormal activity- each individuals experience may be different\nthan what we experienced.",

I also heard a snarling in my ear as I was dragged and it felt insanely real and instead of the shiver it was an intense energy and feeling on my back I don’t even know how to describe this. This probably just sounds like a bad dream to you but I have plenty of dreams, this was different I felt and heard whatever this thing was. \n\nIm scared to go to bed tonight, of course my boyfriend just left for a trip literally 2 hours ago so I’m alone and feeling very paranoid. \n\nI just used a ouija board for the first time two nights ago.. now this? idk. I believe in the paranormal, the ouija board proved it to me even more, but now what just happened to me I’m not sure how to process this. \n\nhow can I prevent this from happening again? I need to sleep tonight but honestly I’m scared.",

Whether it was a friend's house I've never been to before or my house I have always found myself somewhere different. It would always go the same, I'd walk around the house and just keep track of the time, but I would feel compelled to go to certain places in the house. Once I found what I was looking for (whether it be an object or an entity) I would wake up to my alarm the next day. As I've gotten older I've done it less but last night was alarming to me. So I woke up in my room (still asleep in reality) and I went into my living room, I sat there listening to the creaking coming from my basement. I then heard my dog barking down there and it was a very distinct kind of bark, so I went down there, as I turned the corner to see what was happening my dog was not down there but there was a wall that kinda looked like a super Mario 64 painting. As it amalgamated into an entity of just incoherent fog, but what I did recognize was an entity pointing at me, and then I woke up the next day in my bed. If anyone else has experiences like this please let me know so I know I'm not insane, also if you have any questions please just let me know I'd love to answer",

        "text": "So I'll preface this by saying I'm 99% sure this house is haunted as bf and myself have both seen the form of a woman walking around the house before, 9 times out of 10 along the landing at the top of our stairs. We also smell unusual smells like perfume or hear unexplained bangs. Recently I've been seeing things \"out the corner of my eye\" more and more frequently (I'm used to this as I grew up in a haunted home but things seem to be getting weirder lately in my own home)\n\nThis morning bf went downstairs and I was sat in the bedroom getting dressed. I heard as clear as day someone call my nickname from just outside the bedroom door on the landing. I shouted out \"what?!\" in response thinking it was my bf on the landing (no one else calls me this nickname and there's no one else in the house so it must have been him, right?) Then he shouts back from all the way downstairs \"what? Did you just throw something down the stairs??\" Ofc I shout back no...\n\nSo I heard someone call my name and he heard what sounding like a heavy item being thrown down the stairs,  apparently at the exact same time. We checked all around the house in case there was a source for the sounds but obviously found nothing. (And nothing near or on the stairs, our house is very tidy so I'd notice anything unusual or out of place right away)\n\nNo explanation for this at all, we both heard different things by the stairs at the exact same time.\n\nJust FYI there weren't any windows open and our house is a little bit back from the road so it couldn't have been anything from outside. The sounds came from the top of stairs/landing. I'm open to explanations bc I honestly have none!",

I got home and found that there were deep scratches on my bedroom TV, and before I left this morning, it was ok. And that's not the weirdest thing. The night before, my girlfriend and I were home, and we ate pizza, and we're 100% sure there were 3 pieces left in her box that she couldn't eat. In the morning she got up and left before me, and when I woke up I looked to see if she had finished them, and found that she still had 3 pieces. However when I came home this afternoon there were 2 pieces in the box, and she confirmed to me that she had not eaten and that there were 3 pieces. A similar food incident happened to me last week when I returned from holiday. Just before we left, I left half a sausage and a box of fries in the fridge, and when I came back they were gone. Then I thought I must have thrown them away before, or my aunt had dropped by and picked them up. Today my aunt confirmed she hasn't been in town for 1 month, and hasn't been by. I also noticed a little later that the microwave settings had been changed. \n\nI have more stories with missing items, lights left on and things like that, but I always explained it away as me losing it or something. I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do. The only people who have a house key are my aunt, my uncle and my dad. My uncle has absolutely no reason to come home, especially while I'm gone, my dad is on vacation and like I said earlier my aunt is out of town.\n\nSorry if this is not the right sub to share this story, but I don't know another, and just wanted it off my chest.",

I lived a normal life as a kid. Played sports of all kind, went to school, hungout with friends when I could, etc. it started with me having these random “episodes” at night. Almost every night without fail. I would be laying in bed with my mom reading to me and all of a sudden feel this deep dark panic and I would start freaking out and crying for no reason. After so long of this happening my mom ended up taking me to the psychiatrist to see what was going on. They couldn’t figure it out. This went on for a while until it started to go on longer into the night. The “episodes” quit happening. I wish they hadn’t, because what took it’s place was 10x worse for me.\n\nOne night I was going to bed, same routine. Shower, brush teeth, hop in bed and have my mom read me a story to try and sleep. After so long I ended up passing the F out, long day. I woke up in the middle of the night not knowing what time it was. It felt pretty late/ early in the morning and it was pitch black in my room. I felt this heavy, deep and dark presence in my room and I was frozen. Unable to move by fear. It felt like there was something in my room staring at me from the corner of my pitch black room. I waited for probably 10 minutes to build up the courage to get up and get to my parents room. I get up, take the blanket off and the moment my feet touch the ground I hear voices of all kinds yelling and whispering and screaming my name from all over my room. I try so hard to pretend its not there, saying to myself “this isnt real” over and over. It was definitely real. Im getting the chills now just thinking about it. I made my way to the hallways attached to my room and when I opened the door the voices got louder. I was never touched by anything. I was terrified and this event went on for a few years every night without fail. I dont know what it was. Has anyone had similar experience or does anyone know what it could be? Any info is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

I mentioned to my SO that I couldn't find Zeppelin III and she told me she has never owned a Led Zeppelin album. I have a clear memory of seeing it and I am 100% convinced I've even played it before. Then I mentioned that she does have a Zeppelin album because I came across it while looking for that one but just didn't feel like listening to that particular album. She was adamant that she didn't own any. So I went to prove her wrong by going to get the other album that I clearly remember seeing in the collection only hours before. I couldn't find it anywhere in the collection. I even pulled every album out 1 by 1 but it just wasn't there.\n\nNow I feel like I'm losing my mind. Could something paranormal be happening here like dimension shifts or am I just going crazy?",

I would just see fog, and a weird ambient light.\n\nAnd then he would stride in, observe me somewhat dispassionately,  and then stride past and out of my room down the hall.\n\nI called him the Snake Man, because his upper chest and head were of a rearing snake.\n\n(And once I became much older I realized how ridiculous he really looked...)\n\nBecause the rest of him was wearing, like a Colombo style knee length brown jacket. And he had normal arms, legs and shoes...\n\n\nHe didn't feel or seem ridiculous though. He was terrifying. And menacing. And after the door had actually been opened up during the night a couple times in the next couple months. (Which I got blamed for, even though I would have had to stand on something to even reach the lock...)\n\nSo I decided I was sleeping on the couch in the living room instead of the bedroom, and just did that for several years, until my family moved out of that house.",

        "text": "This happened about 10 years ago when I was in high school. My high school was generally considered to be haunted. It was built in the early 1900s and was used as a seminary and a hospital before becoming a school in the 1970s.\n\nIn one class, we had to film a mock interview in a group of four using the school laptops. My group decided we would use a small storeroom down the hall from the classroom to film as it was nice and quiet. We all acknowledged that the vibe in the room was a bit off in, but we didn't think much else of it. Before we started filming in the storeroom, we did a quick test video in the classroom to make sure everything was working. Video and audio were normal, so we proceeded to the storeroom where we filmed our piece. When we were done, we played it back to see how it went. There was no audio playing with the video even though the laptop volume was unmuted and no headphones were plugged in. Thinking we had maybe muted the audio for filming, we did another take, checking the audio settings to ensure we were recording sound. When we played this back, again, there was no audio.\n\nWe went back into the classroom to explain this to our teacher, and when we played the video to show them, the audio worked perfectly, even though we hadn't adjusted any settings between the storeroom and the classroom. Just to be sure, we took the laptop back to the storeroom, played the video, and once again found there was no audio. Back in the classroom, audio.\n\nMy friends and I discuss this experience every so often, and none of us can think of an explanation.  I'm curious to hear what your thoughts on this are, and if you've experienced something similar.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I moved in an apartment from the 1800s around 5 years ago that people supposedly died from, and I live near train tracks where people have also died. Basically a lot of death in area. Before I had moved from my apartment, I saw a shadow look at me when I opened my mothers bedroom door then proceed to quickly crawl into her closet. I followed and opened door and it just growled at me like a deep growl. Scary (over a year and a half ago) then when I decided I didn’t want to live with my other family I moved back into my old apartment (back in with my mom) the first night or first few nights I came back I was laying in bed one night and the shadow I saw it crawl from the end of my bed (in the shape of a cat kind of), come up really close to my face like it was sniffing it and quickly walked away. This was not sleep paralysis it only lasted a few seconds and I was on my phone on my side at the time. I thought it was my cat but right after I looked at the end of my bed and my cat was still laying there, and she’s all white anyways.. this thing had walked past my head. I am not schizophrenic and don’t have any other conditions that would cause me to hear/see things that aren’t there. Fast forward for the next few months stuff was flying off my dresser my book shelf all around my room. Something flew off at my cat I watched it with my two eyes and she ran out of the room. Last March I was on the phone with my friend , dead silent in my room, my back was turned and my black cubby thing up against the wall suddenly all the drawers fly out everything is all across my floor from it we both heard the loud crash it was so sudden and crazy I really wish I was turned around to witness it, I was talking about moving again so idk if it’s a ghost and it angered it or what the hell is going on. Another incident was I was making cookies but I walked back into kitchen and cookie dough flew off stove right at me like literally flew with so much force it was crazy. 4 months ago I was doing my makeup and my makeup box started levitating from the farther side away from me and started moving as if it was being pushed towards me. Last night I was talking about giving into my ocd but right as I got the sentence out I heard a loud crash in my room I caught the sound on camera if anyone’s interested. I was begging it to do something else to show me I’m not crazy and like 20 minutes later I was standing in front of my dresser when all of a sudden it shook aggressively from side to side for like a second like off the ground, house wasn’t shaking nothing else moved so I don’t think it was caused by an earth quake, it was very sudden and it’s just crazy. I’m going to set a camera up in my room when I get paid and see if I can catch anything on camera to finally prove that this stuff is actually happening and that I’m not insane.\n\nTldr: weird paranormal stuff going on and I want advice and any stories from other people thanks :)",

        "text": "Im from Ohio, in the united states. When I was in 4th grade(10 years old, 19 now) me and my buddies were out in the woods behind my buddies house. We were always back there growing up, there was a creek we would hop over and just on the other side was a farm with some horses. One day we had just jumped over the creek but were still in the woods right by the creek. That's when we heard what sounded like a little girl scream at the top of her lungs. Being young kids we all just froze thinking it was odd to hear such a vibrant scream in the middle of the day. about 5-10 seconds later, right in front of us, a black figure zoomed across some bushes and shrubs at lightning speed. we all looked at each other and bolted out of the woods to my buddies house. we were all in shock at what we saw and to this day we still talk about how creepy it was. It moved so fast there was no way it was human, and where I live in Ohio(25 minutes south of cleveland) the only wild animals we have here are white tailed deer, coyotes and foxes. This thing was atleast 6-7 feet tall and was black enough to looks like a shadow or something, it didn't look like it was absorbing any light at all, or was absorbing so much it was the darkest black ive ever seen. was just wondering if anyone else in ohio, or the united states for that matter, has seen anything similar. I live right by the cuyahoga valley national park so maybe there have been some sightings there, but this was not in the national park, just a small patch of woods in a pretty suburban area.",

        "text": "TL: DR How I finally removed a demonic attachment from teen years. \n\nBeing bored teens, a few friends of mine and i decided to do a séance to contact the dead. When that utterly failed someone made a homemade Ouija Board and said it would work fine. \n\nIt was slow going but eventually we got answers. And most of us were just thinking someone else was moving it. \n\nUntil it got super creepy and was answering questions only one or few of us knew. \n\nIt was creepy until it got dangerous. The sweetest most timid girl, just suddenly lunged at the other guy there and tried strangling him. \n\nThankfully she was a little thing and we could pull her off and the guy was more startled than hurt. But no one will forget the ugly visage of raw hatred and rage twisted onto her otherwise sweet face. And she claims.shw doesn't remember any of it. One minute asking board questions ,next moment being held back looking at confused friends. \n\nThat was enough for all of us and we never tried a Ouija Board again. But no one of us knew how dangerous it was to leave a board without saying 'GOODBYE'. \n\nWe basically went  out seperate ways and never spoke of that night again. \n\nSweet girl fell into self doubt and depression and struggled with it for years. \n\nOther Girl turned to drug addiction and destroyed her life. She was best friends with sweet girl and other girlfriend of other guy. But pushed them both away after that, and got heavy into drugs. \n\n\nOther guy went downs a slippery slope of rage and ended up pulling guns on people and being arrested and put through court mandated anger management, but only got worse. Found a way to abuse people and be venomous without getting arrested. Ended up pushing every one else away. \n\n\nAnd me? I got a dark Attachment that followed me around wherever I moved or lived. \n\n\nBad dreams. Weird scratches waking up at night. Weird smells or thinking I see something that isn't there when I go look\n Usually a shadow shape of a man. \n\nI tried the whole cleansing and saying. It would help awhile but seem to come back worse after awhile. \n\n\nThen I would try priests and other holy people. Again it would help awhile,and would come back after a time. Especially if I moved. \n\n\nI lost touch with other girl shortly after she broke up with other guy and got into drugs. And ended my friendship with other guy a couple years later after he threw an axe at me in a fit of rage. \n\n\nBut I kept in touch with sweet girl from time to time. And we wouldn't talk about that night, but we talked about how our lives sucked since then. Neither of us could keep a relationship\n Her due to crushing depression even meds didn't help. And me because every girl I dated either had kids that would freak out over the shadow man ,or the girls themselves would be affected like I was and NOPE right the heck out of there. \n\n\nThis happened over 20 years.\n\n\nThen one day Sweet Girl called me all happy. She said her depression was gone ,it seemed for good and the dark cloud over her was gone. She never wanted to scare me but she saw the same shadow man and had the same issues with cleansings and priest blessings not working. She just didn't want to worry me and left those parts out. \n\nI was a bit mad she kept that from me for years because I would have loved to have supported her. But I was too relieved that she got rid of it so far and I was instead curious about how she did. \n\n\nShe told me about a spiritual person she came across through other people she knew who suffered dark entities and issues , she joined a  support group, and many had stories of how a spiritual person helped get rid of the dark Attachment almost instantly and now they were just int he support group to process the old junk,but not worried about new junk popping up. \n\nSo she gives me the info and I get in touch with this person. And I'm a little underwhelmed. The big fix is something I do myself, with something called the Law of Dominion. So I asked a bunch of questions and they answered. \n\nWhat is it? \n\nThe Law of Dominion is the Law put forth by Prime Source Creator to protect all of humanity from dark and evil entities . \n\nWhat does it do? \n\nThis law prevents creatures and beings like demons,vampires,black eyed children, Skinwalkers and any evil entity from entering a home or enclosed and private space without permission. \n\nHow does this manifest with most dark entities? \n\nMost evil entities will beg or demand entry, or try and trick people with sounds or voices to go out into the deep woods or darkness alone. \n\nWhat about animals or the truly innocent young children who don't know any better? \n\nThe Law of Dominion protects young children even more. All evil entities are required to show their true face when trying to seduce young children as an added precaution. Becasue most children will not allow it to come to them or go near such things. This is why young children have more night terrors or insist on monsters in public or things under the bed or in closets in earlier years of development.\n\nHow can this Law help me? \n\nThe Law can be invoked at anytime to protect oneself or an area and works immediately on any dark entities as any connection to light and holiness would be like invoking the blood of Jesus or singing Muslim songs to Allah that seem to work no matter the person's beliefs or background or convictions. \n\nWhy does it work for anyone of any belief or spirituality? Or lack thereof? \n\nPrime Source Creator is the source of all life and love in the universe and is the basis of all religions, but because humans concept of the divine is limited to a human brain, Prime Source Creator can work through any religion you prefer. As long as love is the core and intent. \n\nHow do I personally invoke the Law of Dominion? \n\n\"I call Prime Source Creator into myself. To heal, guide, protect, reveal, communicate and manifest in the way best for my current spiritual growth and well being. \n\n\nI call upon all angels, ancestors, soul group, spirit guides and beings of light, all directly connected to Prime Source Creator , to surround and heal,reveal,communicate, manifest, guide and illuminate in the way best for my current spiritual growth and well being. \n\nWhere I dwell is holy ground. Everywhere I look and walk is holy ground. All my friends and family and pets,and everyone I see is also protected. \n\nAll beings of true darkness disconnected from Prime Source Creator must flee. Or fall low and return to the Light and Love of Prime Source Creator. \n\nAnd so it shall be now and for as long as I live.\"\n\nI thought it was too good to be true. But this person never asked for any money. And just shared all this. So I gave it a try. \n\n\nAnd though a bit doubting, as I said the words I felt this rush inside of me. And as 8nfons9hed 8 felt this weight lift off my chest and almost an audible pop! \n\n\nI couldn't believe how good I felt,I didn't realize I had such a dark weight on me! \n\n\nI didn't get to excited,becasue I had cleansed before and IT ALWAYS came back. But some time went past, and as time has gone on I'm living my life as it's my own again. \n\n\nI'm sure others have been helped by the Law of Dominion. But Sweet Girl and I suffered decades. And our lives are so much better for it. And if you suffered even a day like us you'd try anything once,especially if it's free. \n\nFor me? It works. Highly recommended!",

It was just my Dog and I in the apartment that we share with my Mother, who had already left for work. I had the shower running, and not to get to personal; I was on the toilet before hopping in the shower. All of a sudden I heard what sounds like footsteps running through my apartment hallway. Just to clarify I don’t mean the hallway of the apartment building, I mean the hallway in my apartment. I was shocked my Doggo, who must be in the bathroom with me, didn’t react to that. About 10 seconds after the footsteps started there was a loud crash, it sounded like my desk in my bedroom collapsed, which is catty-corner to the bathroom. My dog responded to that; and started barking like crazy. I finish up quickly on the toilet, grab my towel, and go out to investigate. I assumed maybe my mother had forgotten something and was rummaging around the apartment. There was absolutely no explanation. Nobody was in there, nothing had fallen over, and the front door was locked. My Mother is notorious for not locking the front door, this time it was locked. I even confirmed with her when I got to work, we work at the same location, that she did lock the door this morning. What does this mean? I know I wasn’t dreaming and my dog freaking out after the crash verifies that what I heard was real to me. Anyone have something similar happen?",

So since I moved into my current house, myself and my housemates have been hearing this very high pitched whistling sound coming from the house next door. It’s completely abandoned and boarded up as a fire blazed through it a few years ago. When we first moved in, my housemate mentioned it and said “did anyone hear that whistling last night?”. I’ve been living here nearly a year now and I hear it almost daily. But recently it’s been getting progressively worse. It’s getting louder, longer and much weirder sounding. First it was a small whistle, and now it’s a long ‘aggressive’ whistle. It catches me off guard all the time. I just heard it about 20 mins ago. I normally hear it at night when I am in the kitchen but occasionally I hear it in the day but it doesn’t sound as scary. I really hope that it’s wind flowing through an empty house cause that whistling sound has me feeling like a 5 year old hiding under the blankets. I would post a video but it’s hard to catch since it happens randomly and doesn’t last long enough for me to whip out my phone. But if I happen to catch it I’ll post it in the comments",

        "text": "For context, my boyfriend lives alone in a 2 bedroom apartment. He lives in a gated community with around 12 blocks and 10 houses in each block so it's a pretty big place. I have been going to his place for almost a year now. The apartment is also located near a graveyard. (If that means anything) \n\nAnyway, I stay over during the weekends and I am there practically every other day, too. The first time I visited, I couldn't help but feel some sort of presence. Not necessarily evil, but I did feel something. I am known for being intuitive and I pick up on energy well. However, nothing outright weird happened so I brushed it off. Now, let me get to the slightly alarming bits that got me wondering. \n\n1. The master bedroom of the house has a VERY off-putting vibe to it. It is always dark, no matter whether the lights are on or the curtains are open. \n2. The TV turns off and on by itself sometimes.\n3. Lights turn on by themselves. This happened 2 times and it was VERY CLEAR none of us did it. Once, we were drinking at home and out of nowhere, a light that we never usually turn on because the switch is located in an inconvenient place - was suddenly on. We dismissed it as maybe one of us turning it on when we were drunk and quickly brushed it away. The second time was in the master bedroom. There is a bathroom there that he occasionally uses. One day, before we headed out, I remember the bathroom light being on and thinking to myself \"why does he (boyfriend) keep leaving this light on. The electricity bill is going to skyrocket.\" and I CLEARLY remember switching it off after that. Of course, when we came back home - the light was turned on. \n4. Once, my boyfriend and me were asleep in the other bedroom and suddenly he started coming closer to my side of the bed while still asleep. He kept nudging and when I asked him what happened, he replied saying \"Someone is sleeping there.\" I did not wake him up after that for my own peace of mind. Needless to say, I was shitting bricks for the rest of the night. \n5. My boyfriend's mom came to visit and swears to God that she felt something pull her leg while she was asleep. \n6. Probably the most creepy incident I have encountered - I gifted my boyfriend a leather bracelet for his birthday and he loves it. A week or so ago, he couldn't find it. I went over for the weekend and we scoured the entire house looking for it. I mean, we swept up the entire place. He usually leaves it on a table below his TV and I remember literally sweeping up that whole table looking for it. It's not even a messy table, it just has his helmet and a few other daily stuff like keys. We gave up hope and stepped out. We came home that night and went straight to bed. The next morning, the bracelet was right there on the table as though someone had neatly placed it there. I showed it to my boyfriend, we took one look at each other and we knew. Again, we just chose not to address it.\n\nThis whatever entity that I suspect is there, is not seemingly harmful. Although it is creepy, my boyfriend has lived there for over a year and nothing too alarming has happened except for these things. He lives alone, too. However, it is bothering me a bit. What do you guys suggest we do? Moving out is definitely a doable option but is that the only solution? Do we just leave it alone and co-exist?",

We are working on that.\n3. Office, this one has a few. One is a black shape that is curious and will venture out but not far. There is also a dark tall black mist that hates the door being open and will shut it, slam it, themselves.\n4. Under the bed, I have an around 4ft tall on all 4s creature that lives under the bed. Their back is covered in spikes and they mind their own business. Don’t bother anyone and just does rounds on the apartment every now and then. Not sure what they could be but they don’t bother me\n5. I believe there are a few animals that are here that show every now and then\n6. Outside, there are some really tall creatures with eyes that roam outside at night. They stay in their area minding their business and watch you and do what they do. There are a few things that are curious but stay hidden behind trees and watch. The creatures outside put me in edge the most.",

It had a couple old computers on it, some boxes of random junk, and a ton of DVD cases. They were all empty cases. I had separate storage for the discs themselves, but I had a thing about not letting go of useless items. \n\nIn the living room, which I didn’t really use much there were a couple of old couches. The family cat preferred to hang out there on one of the couches. So there’s the setting.\n\nOne night, probably around 11pm, I went to use the washroom. The cat was on the couch, no one else was home. I opened the door to leave the bathroom, and suddenly, a DVD case shot from the TV stand and hit the wall across the room. At the same time, the cat jumped up, arched its back, and started hissing. Then the cat ran up stairs. That was the only time this happened to me in that basement. Only time I saw that cat, who recently died at age 22, hiss or arch his back. \n\nI’ve only had a few experiences in my life that I would consider paranormal.

The hot tub is nestled on a deck that looks over the bay that reaches only about 10 yards or so off the deck. Imagine a cul de sac of water where you can see distant sparkling lights, hear barking dogs and late night parties of all the surrounding neighborhoods. It’s like living in a big bowl where you can hear things going on miles away. To the right about half a mile down is the Native cultural center with an exhibit on Native history, a couple classrooms, and a longhouse where the Natives host activities such as pow wows for tribal members. On this particular night, there was a pow wow. As my husband and I were relaxing and just taking in the night sky with the soundtrack of singing and drumming, we began to hear in the far distance, howling. Coyotes are common here, wolves are not. I couldn’t tell you what type of animal was howling but it was not a domesticated dog. It was primal and guttural. Soon after, the pow wow of people started howling as well. No more than 5 minutes later, my husband and I see a canine like figure on four legs, running along the beach of the bay. Silently. Illuminated by the moon, we watched this figure run towards the cultural center, seamlessly gliding over the neighbor’s large dock that stood about 3 feet above the ground. I’ve never in my existence seen a animal of that size. Moments later we hear the howls of a creature (the same we heard earlier) but on the other side of us. As soon as we heard it, the pow wow of people started yipping and howling as well. This happened years ago but I still remember that eerie chill of that moment. I should add, this was on the first full moon of the year. The ones the Natives call “wolf moon”. Werewolf? Skinwalker? I don’t know but I know what we saw that night and it was supernatural.",

Thirty feet in the canopy of an old Oak tree, he sat. I was perplexed. At that height, the branches couldn't bear the weight of a squirrel. He was kneeling down, one arm above his head grasping the branch above as if to balance himself. Solid black. A Vanta black. No defining features whats so ever. It was just a solid black mass, but no doubt it was a man. I was fixated. As I stared at him, I could tell he was staring right back at me. \n\nWe stared at each other for what seemed an eternity. Then suddenly he stood up and started running, jumping from tree to tree. Eventually, my house obstructed my view, so I gave chase, but to no avail. As I rounded the corner, he was gone. I ran to the trees but could see nothing except swaying branches on a calm summer afternoon. That was roughly 25 years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Suppose you don't forget an experience like that. \n\nNever really gave much thought to the paranormal or other worldly before that, or after really. It wasn't until about ten years later as I was flipping thru the channels that I stumbled across a documentary about shadow people. I knew immediately that's what I had witnessed way back when.",

        "text": "So, I am a 19-year-old guy, living in Kolkata, India with my grandparents and my mother and I recently started dating. Since we both have certain restrictions of seeing each other (since her parents and my mother are unaware that we are dating for obvious reasons ) for this upcoming Valentine we both decided to go to a book fair which was happening in our city. Since we both were anime enthusiasts our soul-purpose was to look for comic books (manga) and have a good time together. So on 11th Feb, we decided to go there. Everything was going well until we decided to have some snacks at that fair. While ordering snacks, we met a guy, probably in his 30s and a bit shorter than me(I am 172cm/5'7\"). He was asking for 60 rupees (0.73 USD) since he doesn't have enough money to pay the fair to return home. We both were quite aware of the scam going out forever in countries like India. So we both disagreed but then he asked me to shake hands with him (to which I don't know why I agreed). After that nothing happened but it was the next day when strange things started to happen. My mom saw a tall person, having a beard, and wearing a black cloak appearing and then disappearing in thin air, my grandma sitting in the most bizarre way one can sit on the couch. The next day (Feb 14th) I was sleeping on the eastern side of the bed when I saw a lady in pink kurti (Traditional Indian attire) with long hair tied up in a bun staring at me. As she approached me I immediately locked my thighs around her hand so that she couldn't escape and started screaming. Then she managed to get away and I got woken up by my mother and to my surprise, I was sleeping on the other side of the bed (west side). My hands and feet are cold while typing this so pardon me for my mistakes and errors in grammar. But for now, I need your help. **Give me some suggestions on how to lift the curse or whatever the hell this is.**\n\nthanks,",

        "text": "I’ve been haunted since I was a kid. As cliche as it sounds, my ghostie is a little girl and she conveniently looks like the girl from the ring. Anyways, many other people that I know have seen her as well so I know I’m not crazy. She hasn’t been as active lately but I found a ridiculous amount of maggots in my kitchen. First thought was, “something got left out.” I looked everywhere, didn’t see anything. I cleaned up the maggots and deep cleaned the area where I found them and the rest of the kitchen for good measure. A few days go by, nothing. Completely normal. All of a sudden, more maggots in the same spot. I looked outside, no dead animals, no food/meat left out inside…did the same thing and cleaned everything. Shortly after that, ghostie starts terrorizing my roommate. She’s never been physical with anyone aside from me so my roommate didn’t get hurt, just scared. My ghostie has never left “presents” like maggots before. Could this be related to her? Am I psyching myself out?",

        "text": "So I live in Northern Ireland and there’s this forest called BallyBoley Forest. If you look it up you will find it is one of the UKs most haunted forest and said to be haunted by druids. I’m the old days, druids would use this forest as a sight for human and animal sacrifice. Numbers of encounters follow as so: Seeing hooded figures with lanterns, smoke coming from inside tree lines (common one), screams from animals and humans and even blood on trees. BUT. I have never experience anything unusual apart from a bush being moved on its own and branches breaking when I say “if anyone’s here break a branch”. Expect for one thing, there are many stone formations and even carvings which prove that these druids do exist and I’m out to find out more, experience more and even uncover some treasures. I plan to do some metal detecting and need help researching what type of treasures Druids may have had or even if anyone knows a lot about Druid culture such as markings and behaviours please dm me or comment. This has been a long thread, if I missed anything out I will put it in comments!",

My brother picked her up to see what was wrong and then after a few minutes she calmed down. My brother thinks someone might have broken into our house but all the doors and windows are locked, there was no way anybody would have gotten and the cameras would have saw if someone did break in. I think otherwise, maybe my chihuahua saw something we couldn't see like a ghost, now I'm afraid that my house might be haunted.",

I would’ve brushed it off if I was the only one who heard it but my dad heard it too. It wasn’t the TV because it was in English and she was calling out in Spanish. I always found it weird tbh. My dad said he experienced other things like that in the apartment but he always joked around with us so I’m not sure if I really believe him. My mom also use to tell me that I use to lock my room and talk with somebody, but I could’ve been just playing with my dolls.",

        "text": "So when I was a teen I lived in California with my 5 siblings, mom and dad. It was a decently sized house but my parents years prior had made apart of the patio into a room it was nice and made it easier room wise for everyone. Only draw back to the patio room was you had to still walk through the actual patio half go through the sliding glass door past the kitchen just to get to the restroom. I explain all of this for side content of what bizarre happened to me one night. \n\nSo it was maybe about 3am I had been longer then I should of gaming and needed to wake up for school so I got into bed. As soon as I settled down I heard knocks from my door so I woke up got a robe on and opened the door. What I saw was my youngest sister who lived in the downstairs patio looking really sick wearing nicer pj's than I thought she had. I said \"hey sis what's wrong are you ok?\" I was baffled because she would of had to walk past mom and dad's room to get to mine I wasn't sure what was up. She kind of rubbed her eyes made confused grunts I went to feel her forehead since she seemed pale and she felt like she had a fever I told her to get back into bed and asked if I can get her some water and a towel for her head. I also asked if she wanted me to wake up the parents but she interrupted me and spoke sharply at me suddenly saying she just wanted milk. I was shocked my sister wasn't one for milk like that and if she wanted it she could have gotten a glass going past the kitchen and the bathroom to our stairs at the time. I remembered how having milk while your sick might not be good so I encouraged her again with this logic and she was just like \" no milk...please just milk\" in a more vulnerable state and she was a sassy girl I hadn't heard her so vulnerable let alone seen her so sick. I asked her if she could make it back to her room while I got on some slippers and I'd take care of her and get her milk to her straight away she replied yes please and like lightning I got myself ready to be there for her. I noted how all the lights were still off everything just seemed still like I was the first one down since everyone went to bed but I wrote it off as simply as maybe the morning chill is making it seem this way . I get her glass of milk and a wet cloth some some medicine and hurry into the cold patio that lead to her room and opened her door but she had the lights off I was thinking \" hey maybe she just shut them off but I can't make it to her because her rooms a mess but she needs this.\" So I warn her I'm turning the lights on gave it a moment and flashed them on only to instantly have pillows flown at me by my sister who's SUPER UPSET WITH ME demanding I leave her alone. I shockingly inform her what just happened and she doesn't believe me at all. I realize at this point she had totally different pj's on she had on what I knew she had and her hair was even up in a bun her looks were completely different! I've been wondering about what the heck happened that night and since then my sister believes me. I've never had a situation like this again in my life and I know I had touched her head to check for a temperature I could smell that one sick smell people give off when they are unwell as well. Countless times over the years I've inquired to her asking if she just tried to prank me but she swears she'd never make me worry like that and even then after almost 20 years she would have told me by now. Whenever we remember the event it sends shivers down our spines!",

I couldn't move or talk so I somehow managed to get up and he disappeared. Two hours went by and I thought it was just a nightmare until I got up to my bathroom and my cat was growling in the darkness of the bathroom as if was something in there. To be honest I don't know what I could do to avoid bad moments, actually I have holy water at home and I think I will do something with it at home.\n\nCould you help me with information or how to avoid this from escalating to a bigger type. \n\nThank you very much",

I usually see him with just his coat and paper. \n\nI’m asking this question because I’ve gotten used to his voice patterns and a couple of times I’ve noticed his voice patterns completely change. Like his voice gets darker and is answering questions that no one asked. Almost sounds like a Split Personality type of deal going on here. \n\nIf someone has a Spirit Attachment/Possession would there voice patterns completely change? This is the 1st time I’ve encountered some one with Schizophrenia but I’ve always believed that it is a type of Spirit Attachment that Medical Science refuses to acknowledge.",

A ghostly woman was moving her in like a wave like motion really fast just looking at me with dark eyes. I saw it for a split second before I hid under the covers and screamed for my brother to wake up but he was just asleep and I didn’t get any sleep that night. I know what I saw and I didn’t believe in the paranormal before, and I would like to think I’m still a skeptic but there is no denying what I saw. And this is a personal experience that is 100% true so I think about it a lot. Anybody ever see that wave like head motion out of a figure. So weird",
