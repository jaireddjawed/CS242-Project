I've tried companies of all different sizes, from startups to international corporates, and while I'm currently pretty happy, I realize that this isn't what I want to do my whole life, and because I barely learn anything at uni, and probably won't at least in my bachelors, I'm thinking of switching my studies to something, that could be useful to me when I eventually will want to switch away from software engineering.\n\nI'm most drawn to international relations as I'm very interested in politics and even worked on some political campaigns. However, it's a very competitive field, that I see requires full dedication to \"make it\", for that reason it might not be so suitable for me.\n\nThe other idea was just simply switching my major to Artificial Intelligence and stay in Comp Sci, as it's a field I don't have a lot of experience with, and is very interesting.\n\nOther options I thought about are architecture, design, and maybe a marketing.\n\nI've been battling with this decision for almost a year now, and I'm not even close to making a decision, what are your thoughts ?",

        "text": "I joined a small startup as a software engineer about a year ago. Our engineering team is me, one other engineer, and the CTO. We have a fairly small code base for a web app, consisting of an express.js api and a react client. They started building the app 4-5 years ago and the CTO probably wrote ~50% of the code that remains today. \n\nWhen I joined, they had just begun converting to typescript from JavaScript, there were zero tests for anything (not even unit tests!), they committed directly to main/master constantly and barely ever used PRs or code reviews, and deployments were handled by the CTO running a command from his personal laptop and crossing his fingers that he set all of his environment variables correctly.\n\nFast forward to today, and we’ve converted about half of the code to typescript, we started writing unit tests and the api is at about 30% coverage (client still has zero tests), 100% of our infrastructure is now IaC (terraform), we use a linter and code formatter, we’re tracking issues with linear, we’ve adopted standard git workflows, we have a proper deployment pipeline that enabled us to convert our app into a SaaS product that we have running in half a dozen different environments (generating WAY more revenue now), and we have status pages that continuously monitor for downtime.\n\nAll of these improvements happened because I begged the CTO for them. My CTO is very intelligent, he’s a fast learner, and I genuinely enjoy working with him (and I believe that feeling is mutual), but he has some awful coding habits and a lot to learn. For example, pretty much every page on the client is a single, 1000 line function. No components that we can reuse… just massive files that are next to impossible to understand.\n\nThe CTO reviews most PRs, but he approves pretty much anything you submit, so the other engineer’s code is typically just as bad as the CTO’s. I’m honestly not sure if they don’t know how to write maintainable code, or if they just don’t care, but I can’t continue working on their buggy shit spaghetti code forever - it’s not any fun. I also don’t think anyone else has a clue how bad the code quality is because our CEO frequently states that we have “3 very senior engineers.” (The CEO is also a coder, but he’s very junior)\n\nWhat advice do you have? How do I tactfully tell my boss (CTO) that he’s been writing shit code for 4 years and I need him to stop doing that? How common is this problem, really? Is this just how startups go? Should I just find a job somewhere else?",

In my current organization, we do not have proper feedback culture and I have a question about how can we provide sufficient feedback to the engineers. Please notice that a year ago we have added internal code reviews which have been proven to work exceptionally well.\n\nOur goal is to provide a process or tool that will assist them to improve their Technical (mainly) and Soft skills.\n\nSo far we have seen various 360 tools, however, I am afraid that this is not the ideal way for assessing technical skills, skills specific to an individual project, or granular performance indicators, since it typically involves many people with different backgrounds and levels of involvement with the reviewer.\n\n360-degree feedback may be too subjective to assess some aspects of a software engineer’s performance.\n\nWhat is your view on the matter?\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nJohn",

I mean it's still challenging from time to time but once I am used to the codebase and domain, then it's not challenging at all.

        "text": " \n\nThe difference is not that one goes to an IIT institution and the other does not. The only difference is that one knows that they have infinite potential and the other does not know that they also have infinite potential.\n\nWhen I was in college, I used to think this a lot. What are the things that make IIT so special. Why are so many students running behind it. Are the faculties so good? But non iitian institutions also have good faculties. Is the course structure better? But many have the same course as well. Are the hotel facilities, food, classrooms better? Are the practical labs better? You can find ample examples denying this. Then why are sooo many students dying to go to those colleges.\n\nI am in one of the FAANG right now, and I know the answers now. My company is filled with both IITians and non IITians and the only similarity they have is that they all know that they have the potential to do anything, they have the power even to change this world. I have never seen an IITian doubting themselves if they are capable of doing something or not. They are very sure, they will do it. \n\nIf every student understands that they are also capable of doing wonders, they are not different from those who study in a different building, holding a tag of IIT with them, then it will solve many problems. The main cause of a lack of self confidence comes mainly from our homes. In India, most parents don’t have trust and confidence in their children. They have seen their loved ones, doing stupid stuffs when they were young, and they don’t expect them to change much when they are in their 20s. They train their kids to secure a job, big enough to survive with the inflation. There were not many job opportunities for us a few decades ago, but we can do whatever we want and achieve anything we can think of today. \n\nMany fear from dreaming big. I am not sure what they are even afraid of. There is no tax on thinking big yet. If we will not consider planning about being a better person, better than what a non-iitian mentality person can even think of, then we will never be able to grow. If you are reading this, trust me, you have infinite potential and I really mean it. You just need to ask yourself how to utilize this potential.",

However, as a captain I have to decide which answer to go with when several different answers are submitted by my teammates. I like this role and I have a pretty good record of going with the winner even when I'm not entirely sure myself if my selections will be correct. Is there anything in SW like this?

This, however, is asking me to build an address book web application, implementing a front and backend (they havent used these terms though). I have the knowledge to do it and frankly its fairly easy, just time consuming. \n\nOne point though is theyve asked us to do it fully object oriented. Now im using purely javascript for this as it the language I know very well, more specifically React.js and Node.js. I know all they want from this is to check if I understand OOP, which im confident I do, just I cant find a place where OOP is needed. \n\nThe backend will just be API endpoints which I will be using express to implement. I could potentially implement some sort of OOP with the data but really only one class could be used as the only data we have recieved is a 4 element JSON array with keys: firstname, lastname, phone, email. I cant really use any OOP techniques such as abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, etc because the data set is so small. \n\nFinally we come to react, ive already got a front end implemented but ive done it functionally as thats what ive learnt and also be told to use on the internet. Furthermore, ive been told the devs of react want you to start using functions rather than classes as many of these class properties and features are being depricated.\n\nFurther points that may be useful, this is for a graduate role and have said they dont expect us to know everything. Im just worried that it will ruin my chances becuase I didnt really implement and OOP becuase there was no need for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
