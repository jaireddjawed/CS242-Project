What's surprising is that, despite being over 50 years old, the film looks better than any modern-day space movie, including Gravity and Interstellar. This got me thinking - how is it possible for a movie made over 50 years ago to surpass modern films that use advanced CGI and filmmaking techniques?\n\nEven more perplexing is that other films from the same era, such as Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Andrei Tarkovsky's Mirror and Stalker on Blu-ray, also blow modern cinema out of the water visually. Even old twilight zone episodes on Netflix look better in hd than say black mirror episodes. \n\nI'm struggling to comprehend how something created so long ago can still look better than the best modern technology can produce.
