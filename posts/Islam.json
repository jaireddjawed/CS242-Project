I come here for consolation and a sense of ease on myself as I am person who is very guilt-ridden and tend to be very hard on myself. My parents have driven me crazy, i've been mad as a child and dreamed of running away since as young as I can remember. I love my parents very much, but they were very controlling and abusive. My mom is very cold, unloving, and indifferent to my plight in life, she leaves me on the streets and does not like me around the house. Unfortunately she is a very miserable woman and there is not much i can do for her. My father is a very nice man, but he is not normal and he is extremely controlling over me even at the age of 27 and hinders my natural ability to grow and make decisions for my own life as an adult. He is overly concerned, anxious, and his constant fearful behavior has put limits on my life which restricted my ability to develop.\n\nSo much abuse as a child and teenager led me to running away, drug use, lots of haram relationships, neglecting the deen entirely, addiction, homelessness for years, and doing lots of stupid things. I had no sanity in the mind since as young as I can remember, yet in spite of this I tried very hard to make things work. I went to school then failed, then tried again, in total sum I failed college over 3 times in my life and have gotten absolutely nowhere. I tried to focus during those days, and my dad would constantly take my time attention and energy from my studies to give him attention to his problems. He is in reality like a child, who constantly needs the attention and validation, and he constantly takes up our time to vainly talk about politics, or gossip about family, or talk about things that have absolutely no benefit.\n\nMy parents have no ilm of the deen, they dont know how to recite quran, they dont even know how to pray properly, they don't know anything about the deen, absolutely nothing. They merely muslim by name and image. Deen is last priority in their life, and both my parents are like children who depend on controlling of their kids to keep them happy. Since as young as I can remember, they take joy out of making me miserable and confused, and bullying me, and putting me down.\n\nMy entire life has gone down the drain, religious wise and dunya wise. The mental strain and burden they put on me has really made me lose my sanity. I have little sanity left these days, and am just hanging by the thread. I literally cannot make my mind to work again after taking such a L these past few years with everything that has happened. My life has surmounted to very little now, days are spent bottled up in addiction and waste. My walls are closing in on me, and my only options left is to vanish, dissapear and focus on recovery, mental health, and strength. I need complete isolation, complete solitude, so my mind can breathe. Me, staying in the community i am in now is simply to much to bear, I tried it and it didnt work. The imams say its haram to cut off ties with family, but in the Quran in so many places Allah swt has given us stories about Anbiyah as who were commanded to abandon their astray families to save their ownselves. However I am not cutting ties, I am leaving to benefit myself and plan to return when I have better control over my mind. So why today the imams and learned people can't see this? What am i missing here? My family are wrong doers, they dont care for the deen and are doing nothing but dragging me into the hellfire. I cant follow their footsteps. This is my diary. Thanks for reading, may Allah guide you the reader and guide me. Ameen.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678728665.0},{"title":"Thoughts on this?

As some of you may know from my last post I made on this Reddit group- I\u2019ve been dealing with unbelievable stress and fear regarding learning about Islam. I did a quick google search and saw that I actually had a small mosque super close to me! It\u2019s hidden a bit- it\u2019s really far out from the road and is behind a different building but it was there!\n\nI drove over to the building and at first thought it was a mistake on googles end because there was no signage or anything but out of the corner of my eye I saw a tiny road leading way behind the building and decided I would just look. I drive back there and I see two entrances that specified \u201csisters entrance\u201d and \u201cbrother\u2019s entrance.\u201d I went to the correct one and pulled on the door\u2026. It was locked. As awkward as it was standing there I felt a huge amount of anxiety. I look over and I see a man standing on the other end of the building and he looked away as soon as I looked at him. Embarrassed, I quickly walked back to my car. I sat there and collected myself and decided to call the mosque as a \u201cwell at least I tried\u201d attitude. SOMEONE ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY.\n\nI was shook. Asked what I needed and I replied that I\u2019d like an English copy of the Quran. He said they are free and I can pick one up in 20mins when they opened. I sat there and waited. Before I went in, I called again because I saw many women wearing niqabs and felt really out of place. I asked the guy if I should find something to wear before coming in and he laughed. He said no, and that no one would judge me. \n\nI went in and walked in and all the fear in me melted away. I felt at peace and at home. As soon as I entered into the main area, I was greeted by a few children. One little girl in particular became my little buddy immediately. She asked me all sorts of funny questions like \u201cwhy do you have piercings?\u201d \u201cWhy do you wear rings?\u201d \u201cI like your nails!\u201d \u201cWould you like candy?\u201d \u201cDo you have animals?\u201d She was so adorable. When I went to sit down and wait for someone to come to me, another random little girl from a crossed the room waived hi to me. I waived back  and she came running up to me and gave me a hug. I was almost in tears.\n\nThe man I spoke to on the phone came and talked to me and gave me some information packets and a bag of goodies. He introduced me to his daughter who was a university student for Islam. She answered all sorts of questions and was so kind to me.\n\nShe told me to sit with her and the Iman and speak about Islam. He was also her husband! It was amazing. I\u2019ve never felt such peace in my life. They asked if I wanted to come today to listen to a speaker and I\u2019m going!\n\nI never knew that I all my life I\u2019ve been feeling comfort and for the very first time I felt peace.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678640103.0},{"title":"Is Tawba prayed exactly like Fajr except with different intentions?","author":"moja1994","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/11qcnhy\/is_tawba_prayed_exactly_like_fajr_except_with\/","text":"What else is different?

I wanted to go to a university last year where my parents fully supported my decision. I went with my Dad to the open day and he helped book my accommodation. When results day came and my parents found out I was going to have to move away they panicked and got worried. \n\nMy Mom cried and used emotional blackmail in a sense comparing me to other girls my age who either took a gap year since they didn\u2019t get a place to the local university or just went to a local university. \n\nMy Dad threatened to leave me financially abandoned and taken out of his will.\n\nWhat hurts is the fact that both my parents knew it was my dream university to attend.

Also, with a piece of paper you can force her to at least read it before she rejects you.\n\nSo yeah if she is interested ask for her wali to contact you and provide you with a similar profile and InshaAllah you guys can set up discussions from then on out. You can also learn from the wali about what she is like as well. \n\nBut if she isn\u2019t, move on. Allah has guided you away from her and the best of marriages are the ones that aren\u2019t delayed and the easiest to do. If she didn\u2019t appreciate your method of being upfront and direct and would have preferred a more subtle flirting style, she most likely isn\u2019t the one for you.\n\nI think that this method gets rid of the chances of falling into haram discussions since you\u2019re without a wali and doing this under the excuse of \u201cI\u2019m chatting with her to because I want to get to know about her more\u201d","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678712252.0},{"title":"I have several doubts about satan","author":"Ewaric4859","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/11q8pyc\/i_have_several_doubts_about_satan\/","text":"Was created by god?

So, before I graduated high school I knew I believed in god. I know there is a power greater than me, now that I look back I feel gods love and mercy before I knew it. So In my senior year of high school I researched religion. All religions of the world. All the world religions are cool and fascinating, but the one that caught my eye the most was Islam. I loved it, the Quran, the prophet, the people, the history. I loved the religion of Islam. So when I graduated I went to a mosque. Meet these really cool people who were in charge of the mosque. We talked and they told me to read and do research. So I did. Well on that same day my mother found out. I love my mother, but she can be a bit controlling and told me that she didn\u2019t approve of islam. She is the stereotypical midwestern protestant evangelical mother who witness 9\/11 and thought all Muslims are bad. She didn\u2019t approve of what I was searching. So I stopped searching and went to Christianity instead. \nFast forward a year later, and I\u2019m going to get baptized in the Catholic faith. Here is what I need advise on. I do love the Catholic Church. There are a lot of things I love about the church. My mom and my family both agree with my decision. But I still love Islam. I feel that I\u2019m making a big mistake going into Christianity especially because I was going to be a Muslim. What should I do? I am going to college in august.

I've been dealing suicidal thoughts since I was 12-13. My worst of mental states that I had was when I just had turned 18. Now I'm 22. \n\n1. I feel like objectively most people would say, I haven't had a traumatizing past enough or whatever to feel this way. So people would rather think I'm just a weak minded persona who rather thinks of unaliving himself instead of facing his struggles and be patient like most people. Regardless of them being right or not, these kinda impressions make me feel very out of place, unrelatable and devalue my feelings. I rather keep it all to myself. \n\n\n2. I think a lot about suicide. So much that I think growing up I got used to thinking of suicide that it may have become - not a habit but a pattern if that makes sense. Alhamdullilah, I was always believing that this act would get me straight to the fire. And I think I have and always had enough self control to never act upon such urges.\n\n\n3. But it's very very exhausting. How long is this gonna go this way? I can't imagine - if Allah has planned for me to live a few more decades - to carry this mental burden with me for that time.  I'm 22 and I should be in the process of building up life and slowly but steady thinking about settling down as in having a vision regarding Career, marriage, family planning and so on. Meanwhile I'm so past all of this. Completely drown and overshadowed in self-hatred ,if you had a view inside my mind. \n\n\n4. The main reason I'm sharing this here is because my parents once said - talking about suicide - that only Godless people get into this state of mind. Proceeding to say, most people don't need therapy or could avoid all of such mental problems if they were true believers and would live like Allah has taught us to do. \n\n\nI didn't say anything and was just reflecting ever since, questioning whether I'm doing things majorly wrong because I actually try to implement religion as much as I can. Islam is a lifestyle and ideology I actively have chosen for me. I'm not perfect and there's space for improvement but I'm consequently trying to become a better Muslim. \n\n\nBut I can't get rid of wanting to be dead,  I think about it lot, it's sth like \"I wish I just could\" but I'm not going to. I'm convinced that I'm strong enough to go through the calamities God is putting me through but those thoughts are never leaving. And I do agree that I'm might be facing an invisible form of depression but a depression that goes on for a decade by now?? \n\n\nI was really hoping to have a 180 degree shift after my highschool school graduation but nothing has really changed. Like a few improvements but those aren't noticable in comparison to the severity of the \"negative thoughts\" I'm confronted with. \n\n\nIs there anyone who can relate to this? And is struggling with such, really a clear sign of me having a weak Iman and not being such a successful Muslim??

The biggest takeaway I got is that Western values can only be viewed as superior purely based on economics and material living standards. Arguments such as breakdown of family systems, drug use etc that stem from this individualism are actually valid observations and used to highlight that economic centric arguments don\u2019t account for such things.\n\nHowever I\u2019m curious as to what alternative metric could be used instead to support the superiority of Islamic values given discussed metrics such as moral behaviour, cultural \nunity etc are subjective in themselves including amongst Muslims.\n\nSecondly if materialism was irrelevant why do so many Muslims emigrate to countries for economic reasons even when they are less moral from an Islamic perspective? For example Europe or even Dubai which is becoming more Westernised rather than say Indonesia or Pakistan which are far more pious but are not treated with the same regard and desire for immigration towards Gulf countries.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678607731.0},{"title":"i know that after we die our soul remains dormant waiting for judgement day. do we know what exactly happens during that time? have people who died hundreds of years ago been waiting all this time? or did time pass for them in an instant?","author":"Internet_P3rsona","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/11ox7bd\/i_know_that_after_we_die_our_soul_remains_dormant\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678573857.0},{"title":"Revert questions.","author":"Mraustinrox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/11p36j7\/revert_questions\/","text":"Salaam Alaikum Brothers and Sisters,\n\nI\u2019m a recent revert. I just want to get some opinions on things. I understand these opinions will vary greatly, but please be kind.\n\n1. One thing that has made me take pause is the constant mention of Hellfire and punishment in the Quran. I listen to it a lot of nights when going to bed and I always wake up a lot at night anyway and it seems every-time I wake up I hear the word hellfire. I get why this is mentioned often in the Quran. But it feels a little intense.\n\n2. I have some gay friends. Good people, who I don\u2019t believe will go to hell for being gay. It seems the prophet peace be upon him\u2026 Said something about it being a sin, but we all sin\u2026 And there is not a weight put on this sin. So technically if I don\u2019t pray it\u2019s the same amount of sin as someone who may be in a gay relationship by measure according to the Quran correct?

Sins I never even did in my kaafer years. Mind you, it was other Muslims who introduced me to these sins so at the time I was like \u201cwell if they\u2019re doing it, it must not be as severe as I think.\u201d However now I feel so empty and guilty. However, just because I was introduced to it doesn\u2019t mean I should\u2019ve neglected using my discernment. I didn\u2019t commit these sins as a Christian because I knew they were bad and I was raised to do better. Yet, as a Muslim I so readily did them. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s really wrong with me.

I ask for forgiveness of course but recently it feels like I have \u201cfree range\u201d to commit sins without remorse in the moment, but then later on feel like absolute garbage.

Such as the whole lethally enforced modest clothing laws and the cherry picked horror stories of what happens to some people who try to leave Islam or speak out against it.\n\n- The \"Mohhamad is an illierate perverted warlord who created the religion and verses to serve his own sexual and political desires in life\". And while I do have some concern regarding what sorta looks like verses or actions made by mohhamad that appear to have been for his own sexual interest, I dont see how he couldve created a book like the quran that has such tall claims like \"I challenge you to produce something as impactful and perfect as the quran\" I mean thats a BIG claim to make, I dont think that he coudlve done that if he was just simply trying to get laid.\n\n- Random hadiths that seem to depict something really bad or contradictory about Mohhamad. These frustrate me the most because there are tens of thousands of hadiths, I mean am I supposed to look at the background and context of every single one of these when theyre brought up and look bad. Cause well I kinda have to, if not I cant argue against the claim being made that the hadith depicts something very bad regarding mohammad, especially if it seems to show that mohammad was in some way a bad person, which would discredit the entire religion because of the calim that the quran text is supposed to be infaillible. \n\n\nIts just disheartening as someone who wants to study if Islam is worth converting for because each of these are like a punch in the face while Im trying to walk through the world of Islam, it takes effort to goes through these *set backs* that are in the form of new info or statements that seem to discredit the religion. Its like I take 3 steps forward and then take 1 step back depending on how bad something I find sounds because I need to take the time and effort to figure out if its valid or not.

However, this past year, so much has become clear and I want to share that with anyone interested in knowing. Essentially, what I have come to understand is the following, among other things:\n\n1. The Qur'an provides the best method to become the so-called 'Uber-mensch'. Infact, whatever self-help that people provide is already in the Qur'an and is purified and exists in the highest, most sublime level. \n2. The Qur'an is straight from the Knowledge and Thoughts of Allah Azza wa Jal. Its perfection and wisdom far outweigh human intelligence or understanding. That is, its organisation is too sublime to be human. \n3. One should read the Qur'an deeply in order to understand the underlying meanings. By doing this, a person will be able to clean their heart, in sha Allah, and attain the ultimate success. This is, as described in Surah Shams, the supreme success of the Deen. \n\nIslam is the ultimate way of life and contains all philosophies and religions from before and combines them into one, while simultaneously purifying those teachings and perfecting them. How amazing would the world be if people just understood this book!\n\nThe main issue is that no one is focussing on the practical implementations of the book. What a great loss. Or are they perhaps blind to them? Or are they perhaps hiding them?

I however, never considered myself a Christian in the literal sense. I always, always, felt that the Bible in itself was full of fallacy's and hypocrisy's and I never believed in the Bible to be a book about the truth, I always perceived it to be a book about Philosophy that encapsulates a ton of truth but also delivers many lessons in a a somewhat poetic and beautiful way. Eventually, I started studying the religion in itself, I studied the Torah, I studied the Quran. I looked at all 3 of these books and knew right away that anything confirmable through all three has to be the truth BUT at the same time things that are highly disputed among religions need more attention. The story goes on like this for a while but...\n\nIn the midst of researching, reading, analyzing and understanding the beliefs of this religion and after looking around at those who followed these religions I knew, Islam has to be the truth and the followers of Islam are the most devout, dedicated followers of any religion. I find this to be the most beautiful, perfect and true religion and very recently I took my Shahada.  \n\nNow - I'll be honest with you all. I don't think I am a great Muslim. I have struggled very much with cutting out pork for example, I didn't even realize pork was in so many of the products that I was eating regularly, prosciutto would be an example - I knowingly cut out sausages and bacon for example but I just keep finding myself forgetting as recent revert. I drink alcohol (not much) and I have struggled with that addiction for quite a long time and I would love to defeat it inshallah but I always seem to give in, which might be my deep routed past issues perhaps. However, in fairness, I have been practicing my prayers, I have been praying 5 times a day on work days (which I don't drink) and I make sure to pray at least 3 on the day's I don't work if I intend to drink, because I would not want to disobey the Quran and pray while intoxicated even the slightest. I still clean up and occasionally shave most of my face, I have yet to read the hadith and from where I am sitting, the Quran is the most important book in the world. \n\nI think my biggest fear is that I do not want to appropriate Islam, it's changed me spiritually in so many positive ways. I know many Muslims who share my same struggles or don't practice all of the Islamic practices like beards. Even celebrity's like Mike Tyson, Dave Chappelle, Vinnie Paz and so many.\n\nInshallah I will always improve and become a better Muslim but I just wanted to vent and get feedback.

I have been praying for these people, specifically the ones in my form, to have their hearts purified and have Allah shine his gaze upon them. But meanwhile I keep falling pray to Shaytaan and end up talking about bad things with them. Once I had a crush on some christian girl and didn't want to acknowledge it. However, I let slip to someone about my feelings for her and he told exposed me to the point my whole year group found out (and she was even dating at the time). My feelings went away as I predicted but I felt ashamed I let something like that happen. Now I have started feeling things for this other girl who is thankfully Muslim but doesn't pray dhur or jummah - not that I am judging. She gets into dating a stuff too and I wanted to try and make her change without being pushy. I read a hadith in an Islamic book about resisting evils in society that said \"A believer is a mirror for another believer\". Mirrors point out your faults such as if your face is dirty or your hair is messy. Believers point out your faults by letting you know if you are doing haram or not. People get angry at these believers yet they wouldn't get angry at a mirror would they? If they believer says it with good intentions and in a polite tone, you shouldn't get angry at them. So inshallah I can help these people without being pushy or arrogant by praying to my lord and becoming a better person myself. Meanwhile I will try not to fall into this trap of Shaytaan.

But is it true?\n\nAnd when we examine this verse from the Quran, it says:\n\n(Quran 16:69)\n\n \"and feed from \u02f9the flower of\u02fa any fruit \u02f9you please\u02fa and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for you.\u201d From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours, in which there is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect. \"\n\nDoes honey have the ability to cure or aid in the cure of anything since Allah mentions healing for individuals but doesn't specify what kind of healing?, According to studies, honey can treat a variety of conditions, including coughs, burns, wounds, and acne. It can also maintain blood pressure, improve heart health, treat various stomach and skin conditions, and even prevent several cancers. So from what I can tell at this time, it's almost everything.\n\nActually, I wasn't able to attend the last Jummah prayer because I was sick and coughing a lot, and even after finishing my medical treatment, I didn't feel any better. However, when we bought some honey, my cough subsided after using it twice a day for about two days, and I felt much better. As a result, I was able to attend this Jummah prayer, Alhamdulilah, proving the study's claim that honey can treat cough,\n\nWe can probably all agree that milk is the healthiest beverage. Milk is often referred to as nature's perfect drink.\n\nSo, what do you think about those two claims?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678481956.0},{"title":"O Messenger, may All\u0101h honour you","author":"mylordtakemeaway","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/pgrwavf3cwma1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678447318.0},{"title":"how to make up a prayer days later ?","author":"SuitablePea9821","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/11o5ghp\/how_to_make_up_a_prayer_days_later\/","text":"Two days ago I prayed Isha however felt as if I broke my wudu during tashahhud, I felt wind but was unsure because I didn't actually feel anything come out (dosn't rlly make sense but I made a previous post about it if you wanna read that), I still continued and finished the prayer.

Not only will this help guide me but anyone who has the same confusion about this will come across it and it will help them. Thank you to whoever puts in the effort. If I can\u2019t find the answer I\u2019m going to give up on it probably.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678457601.0},{"title":"Seeing God in Heaven","author":"limanyasmaa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/11nq6dc\/seeing_god_in_heaven\/","text":"Can you just take a few moments to realize that in Heaven, one will be able to see, really to see, God, not His Name written in gold letters in a piece of velvet, no, but to see the true Face of God.

However, I recently started finding peace in my religious mainly because of my fear of Judgement Day and learning of the mercy and beauty of ALLAH set. I found comfort in placing my head down in sajdah to my one and only Lord. I loved the idea of running to Him whenever the duniya became to hard to deal with but, I have started growing distant to my Rabb even though it pains me. \n\nA while ago, I heard from an Islamic video of the 3 people who's worship will not be accepted and it was said that amongst those people will be people who caused their parents\/mother pain. If I'm honest I haven't had a good bond with either of my parents and no matter how hard I try I am deemed a failure and utter disappointment to my parents. I am shamed and ridiculed in my own home and everyday I go downstairs for the smallest things I am met with such hatred and disgust from my parents and nothing I do is good enough for them even though everyone outside my home is pleased with me and my character. This leads me to the question, is it actually my fault that I have parents who I will never be able to please so I end up resenting them as much as they resent me? Is it my fault that they think of me as ugly when Allah set created me this way (I am not overweight nor do I have much acne as a teen, I am constantly working on myself)? Is it my fault that I am struggling mentally and can't eat, sleep, or function like everyone else? Why is it okay for them to compare me to others? They even say out loud that they would be okay with their child being my cousin and even my non-muslim neighbor's daughter instead of me, neither of those two people work hard, study, or even dress modestly, they are just good at putting on the facade of being a kind hearted person. I feel trapped and the One who I thought I could run to when I am hurt by this world has shut His door of mercy to me making me no longer able to pray. I still recite Duas and dress modestly but hearing that none of my acts of worship will be accepted has basically killed my spirit. \n\nThe second thing killing my Iman is another video I watched, it said that a woman can't refuse her husband's intimacy unless she is sick\/has health problems and if she does then the angels will curse her and ALLAH swt will be angry with her if her husband is angry with her. I am not married and I probably won't be married in a decade but this video, the way it said that because the husband fully provides for the wife, she has to please him in a married spousal manner or she has to get a divorce made me sick to my stomach. I thought Islam pushed the idea that the husband and wife should be at peace when together, and that the man shouldn't act in an intimacy starved\/lewd manner. Also, I thought Allah swt created men and women equal but different so why isn't it a good enough reason to not pursue intimacy simply when the wife says she feels uncomfortable or wants to stop? Why is the woman forced to pursue what the man wants even when the wife probably wouldn't enjoy what they are doing? I have a couple more questions but this post is already so long so I will wait to ask more questions in the future. JazakhAllah Khair for taking the time to answer my questions, and may Allah grant you Jannah.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678420094.0},{"title":"Is anyone else just thankful to be a true Muslim even though you genuinely are not religious?

You will become beloved to Allah\n2. Your sins will be forgiven.\n\n\u201c..follow me Allah shall love you and forgive your sins\u2026\u201d (3:31)\n\nAllah will love that person. On receiving Allah\u2019s love, what does one receive? In the hadith:\n\nAbu Hurairah (rad) reported the Prophet (saw) said, \u201cWhen Allah loves a slave, calls out Jibril and says: \u2018I love so-and-so; so love him\u2019. Then Jibril loves him. After that he (Jibril) announces to the inhabitants of heavens that Allah loves so- and-so; so love him; and the inhabitants of the heavens (the angels) also love him and then make people on earth love him\u201d.\n\n(Riyad as-Salihin 387)\n\nFor example when Musa (as) was born, Pharaoh ordered in his kingdom that any child of Bani Israel born should be immediately killed. During this adversarial time, Musa (as) is born. Allah inspired his mother to place Musa (as) in a basket and cast him into the river. The basket flowed into the hands of Pharaoh\u2019s soldiers. While there is an order to kill children, they opened the basket found a baby boy. What does Allah say?\n\n\u201c\u2026And I had cast love on you from Myself (so that you might be favourite of all)..\u201d (20:39)\n\nThis is power of Allah and His assistance. He is going into the enemy\u2019s hands, Allah placed love for him in their hearts. No weapon, strategy, other method was used. Whoever saw Musa (as), loved him. After seeing him, Pharaoh\u2019s wife started to love him. She exclaimed no one will hurt this baby. Why? Allah has placed love in their hearts. The enmity children of Bani Israel are to be killed is gone. Love is amazing. Love is such a thing!\n\n\u201cLove is such a thing, dead become alive\n\nLove is such a thing, king become a slave\u201d (Persian couplet)\n\nJust as Allah placed love for Musa (as) in hostile environment, Musa (as) became beloved. Allah is saying when you will follow Prophet (saw)\u2019s way, Allah will place your love so you will become beloved.\"\n\nLove is not due to wealth, looks, someone's persuasion or manipulation.

A little backstory.\n\nI (M21) am expected to marry a girl (20) this December. She is so kind, shy, and generous. May Allah guide her. But she has suffered an enormous amount of religious trauma. Her father beat her horribly after any mistake, and justified it using religion and his authority as a father. He would throw her against the wall if she did not pray as a young girl. She told me of when he would pin her against the floor and punch her repeatedly after the most minute changes in her tone. It was horrible. She would also resort to self harm throughout her adolescence to cope.\n\nAs time went on, her family moved to Egypt so her dad could study the religion. After years of more abuse, they moved to my city, and her dad became the imam of our masjid after getting acquainted with the community. \n\nFor the next few years he had lightened up on her and her brothers. But soon, he began to falter in his faith. The community began to use and abuse her family because of their status and she began to hate Muslims in general. She told me that he began to drink and that her mentally ill mother was considering suicide due to the stress and disrespect. \n\nSoon after, he started preaching an Americanised Islam, and it started to latch on to her. Then his family had to move to Chicago because they couldn\u2019t handle the Muslim community, their position, and also because her grandpa was sick and they needed to tend to him. \n\nDuring this time he had completely left Islam. And her entire family as well, except for her. Her dad would yell at her and bully her and abuse her so she could leave Islam as well. But alhamdulilla, she remains Muslim. \n\nShe now gets panic attacks if she were to ever pray, and it is not often that she does. What can I do before we get married?
