        "text": "Title. Basically, I’ve been using the core 2.3k deck that everyone always talks about, and while I think it’s well put together, I’m finding it damn near impossible to remember words / verbs involving kanji that I have yet to encounter on WaniKani. \n\nWaniKani has been incredibly effective for me when it comes to memorizing kanji meanings/readings as well as vocab. I’m on track to complete level 29 in 2 days; I advance a level every 9 or so days. My review accuracy with it is pretty high as well. I’m a visual learner so the mnemonics really click with me.\n\nSo, are there good Anki decks (or other resources) I can be looking at to teach me more vocabulary specifically, using only the kanji that I’ve encountered so far in WaniKani? I’ve learned some vocab using the 2.3k deck, but only with words involving kanji I recognize. It may be easier to have it be like, maybe vocab using the first 30 levels of WaniKani’s kanji, for example. I know level 30 is a big milestone, so maybe that exist, if not “more vocab for level 22” “more vocab for level 23” etc etc. if I keep my pace I’ll have completed level 30 in like a week and a half.\n\n(Also, I know that like 200 or so of the joyo kanji aren’t on WaniKani, but from what I understand they’re really obscure ones and I figure I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it lol. That’s not too many to memorize, I can find a way (likely by making my own mnemonics).\n\n\n*TLDR: I find myself unable to memorize words involving kanji I don’t recognize, so for the time being while I am memorizing the joyo kanji with WaniKani, what can I use to learn more vocab using (only) the kanji I know?*",

As I am a lover of science, she suggested me to look into the Shogakukan no Zukan NEO journals, and they remind me a lot of the journals in my mother tongue that I used to read as a kid. The topics are all quite interesting (space and constellations, wildlife etc.) and I'd be glad to buy like a dozen of those over the following months and read them to level up my vocabulary of interest.\n\nThe issue is, they offer no e-book versions, ans the few \"available\" e-book websites are only functioning in Japan. I'm located in Switzerland. \n\nDoes anyone know where to get these journals as e-books / PDFs? If someone can buy and ensure the transfer of the files to me, I'd be willing to pay as these journals are very appealing to me and are by far the most interesting resource I've stumbled upon.",

        "text": "I've been studying Japanese for about a year and half with a private tutor utilizing Genki 1 while working full time and now attending med-school. We are almost finished with the textbook and will probably move on to Genki 2 in the coming months. Even though we are almost finished there is still so much I need to improve on, because I get the general gist of how Japanese works and the utilization of the grammar points. Due to my busy schedule, I can only study about a couple hours a week. This year I want to increase my proficiency in Japanese a bit more than where I am at (which is around pre-intermediate). My main goal, is to try and reach at least N3 proficiency by the end of this year, if I can.\n\n1. Reading: At this point in time I can only ever read Kana as my tutor said to learn Kanji later on and focus more on the Grammar points in the book. Even though this is fine, I've been wanting to do more reading,  but trying to start reading some Japanese novels is rather difficult since of course it utilizes all Katana, Hiragana,  and Kanji. I've even purchased some simple Children's story books, but is pretty much the same problem. How can I improve my reading skills as a pre-intermediate learner?\n2. Speaking: The only time I can ever practice speaking is with my tutor, which is only once a week. I've looked into places I can try speaking more on a daily with people more proficient in Japanese, such as ITALKI and Hellotalk, but since they utilize a paywall I didn't really want to spend the extra money. So how else can I practice daily conversation by myself? Are there any places I can meet with people (preferably face-to-face) and befriend them while having daily conversation?\n3. Kanji: I've seen on here that *Learning the Kanji,* with Anki is a good way to start learning Kanji. I've bought all three volumes and sort of started doing this type of learning technique. It seems fine, but I was wondering what else I could do to further learn Kanji? \n4. Writing: I get the general gist of the grammar points in the textbook. I haven't mastered 100% conjugation on the verbs, and adjectives. I also tend to forget particles. I'm not confident in my writing. I try to do the practice questions in the textbook with the current grammar point lesson ahead of time before my next tutor session and whenever we go over them I'm still making grammar mistakes, which ends up discouraging me. Is there anything I could do to improve more in my writing?\n5. Also, I'd want to add in that since I can only meet with my tutor once a week, Self-studying is pretty difficult since I'm not sure if what I am doing is correct or not. Which evidently causes me to be discouraged. Does anyone have any study techniques that could be useful?",

        "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nHere’s me hopping on a train wagon that already houses too many people. There’s probably at least one person who in details described what apps, books and tips to follow if you want to learn Japanese. Although if that exists, I have no clue where to find it.\n\nMy point is to learn Japanese on a level where I can speak with people and get around if I travel to Japan. I am 19 so I’m not the youngest for language learning, but I’m up for this challenge. \n\nMy only “experience” is learning japanese on duolingo for a year and watching anime(typical lol). I finished the Katakana and Hiragana section as well as reached Unit 5(almost in Unit 6). I did hear that Duolingo is horrible though so I am well aware it has no weight. As for anime, I can understand basic phrases/sentences and quite a lot of words.\n\nNow, my goal time wise is pretty lenient since I don’t plan any trips to Japan for now. I would love to be able to speak after 5 years of studying(taking that I’d start now). Now I can already sense that one commentor explaining how that is impossible and that I have to summon Satan and give it one of my kidneys and my left eye if I want to achieve what I set up for myself. If it is impossible, I have no issue with that. I’ve been learning and struggling with languages all my life so I’m not new to grinding.\n\nI would really like apps or certain books where I can learn words, grammar and speaking. I got an app called Kanji Garden for Kanji. I heard it’s good. In case it’s not, I wonder if you guys got a better app. I’m not trying to set the record for most kanjis so it’s not that important. I just want to know basic kanji that appears in every day Japanese. Oh, also keep in mind that I don’t have a lot of time, maybe one-two hours free a day. That might help pinpoint the exact way I could learn the language. \n\nI will also read other people’s posts for further advice such as the recent one with the game Stray. Thanks everyone in advance. If I don’t forget, I’ll come back every few months and update you guys on how’s it going.",

        "title": "Self-study Japanese using a University class structure",
        "author": "taiyousea",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10uzef1/selfstudy_japanese_using_a_university_class/",
        "text": "Hey, all. I thought I'd make a post specifically for all the self-studiers out there who get bored super quickly from not having a good routine and are looking for some sort of guideline to help structure their studies better.\n\nI'd been attempting to self-study for a couple years to no effect because I needed a routine, but having a same-thing-everyday structure immediately bored me and in no time I was back to not studying at all. I googled \"Japanese class syllabus\" to see how college classes might be set up, but syllabi, as you may know, are really just overviews of the concepts that will be learned and don't offer information on class specifics. Youtubers making \"how I study Japanese\" videos just have a ton of B-roll of them flipping through Genki I and pouring strawberry milk and then they tell you things like \"watch anime &lt;3\" but, again, offer no specifics about the routines they use to study.\n\nTo make a long story short, I've gone back to school for my graduate degree and I'm using this opportunity to take Japanese classes at my university, fulfilling the information that I was looking for for years. And now I want to offer it to anyone else who finds it impossible to study without some sort of guideline to build a daily routine from.\n\nMy recommendation: Check out how my classes are structured - we don't learn new things every day, we actually spend more time practicing than introducing new things - and sit down with the resources you are using to figure out how you can space your content similarly.\n\n# Basics\n\n**Textbook**: The way my university structures language levels is Year 1-4. Year 1 uses Genki I, Year 2 is Genki II, Year 3 is Tobira, and Year 4 is purely native texts. We also have a \"year 5\" which isn't actually called year 5, it's just the next step to take if you pass Year 4 level, and it includes classical Japanese texts and translation training. \n\nHaving a textbook is essential to creating a structured study plan if you're anywhere lower than Advanced/High-Intermediate level. You might be able to argue that you can set things up better on your own, but it can be very hard to learn without a textbook at hand that has paired grammar and exercises in an order that makes sense for the level being studied.\n\n# Daily Schedule\n\nSo classes are one hour per day, five days a week. Three are labs and two are lectures; labs are exclusively conducted in Japanese, lectures are a mix of Japanese and English.\n\n* **Monday** \\- **Lab**: Speaking practice using last week's grammar, 10 new kanji\n* **Tuesday** \\- **Lecture**: New grammar introduced, answer easy questions using new grammar\n* **Wednesday** \\- **Lab**: Speaking practice using new grammar with harder questions, 10 more kanji\n* **Thursday** \\- **Lecture**: Practice previous grammar, introduce next new grammar with easy questions\n* **Friday** \\- **Lab**: Speaking practice using all grammar from the week, hard questions, videos/songs\n\n\"Easy questions\" would be something like a question that requires just a few words to answer, and \"hard questions\" would be those that require complex compound parts, maybe with an explanation for the answer in the sentence itself. \n\nThis schedule repeats itself, beginning each week with the previous week's grammar and ending it with two new points having been taught. When doing speaking practice, we are not allowed to write any scripts for ourselves or jot our answers down before talking; it's specifically to get our brain to put sentences together more quickly, and then answers or notes can be written afterward. At home, you can try to practice answering textbook exercise questions aloud, recording yourself, and continually answering with different things to stretch your vocabulary memory.\n\nWe have vocabulary and kanji quizzes every other lab day, so if there is one on Monday then the next one will (most likely) be on Friday. The quizzes will be all-verb or all-noun or all-adjective depending on the vocab section of the chapter we're on. If you're using Genki too, the kanji that we're tested on are from the back sections of the book. For a self-studying example, you can try listing every verb in both English and Japanese on paper from memory, time yourself if you want more of a challenge, and then afterward check to see if you forgot any or got any incorrect.\n\n# Homework\n\nWe have homework every other night, including weekends, which will each take about an hour. Because we use the Genki textbook, our homework is usually directly associated with chapter dialogue or activities. Here are some examples of what my homework looks like:\n\n* **Workbook**: The workbook pages that coincide with the grammar points of the week - these will include translation of sentences, questions that you must answer, dialogue that you fill in the blanks for, and multi-sentence writing prompts. Two grammar points per week will usually mean about 4 workbook pages to coincide with them. There are also kanji practice worksheets in the Genki workbooks, which are included in homework as well.\n* **Conjugation**: I dread these but they are necessary - we will conjugate every single verb AND adjective in the current chapter. They will be conjugated into casual past, volitional, conditional, potential, and そう and て forms. If there is a new form in the chapter, such as ばよかった in my current chapter, we will do those conjugations as well. These take me forever to do but I always learn a ton.\n* **Particles**: Along the same lines as the Conjugation homework, we read sentences using the new verbs from our chapter - each of which usually has a specific particle, or particles, that are used with them - and fill in the blanks where the particles go. For you, this could just mean writing 3 sentences per new verb without using the textbook and then checking afterward to make sure you used the correct particles.\n* **Listening Comprehension**: As I stated, we use the Genki series in class, which starts every chapter with a dialogue scene. Our homework is to listen to the official audio on the OTO Navi app (this is free and has audio for every single Genki chapter) and answer questions to test our listening comprehension, such as \"What was Sora's reason for quitting his job?\" and things of that nature.\n* **Reading Comprehension**: Genki books have a lengthy passage in the back section (where the kanji is) which includes grammar and vocab from the chapter, and also has 5-10 comprehension questions to be answered afterward. I'm a fast reader but I struggle with understanding what a question trying to ask, so it's really a mixed bag on whether or not I get the questions right.\n* **Writing Projects**: After every two chapters we write one full page on a given topic (favorite childhood moment, your hometown, future plans, family history, etc.) and use as much of the grammar in as complex of sentences as possible. A page full of first-year 私はすしが好きです-type sentences is fully unacceptable if we've spent the last two chapters learning complex modifications and conjugations. We write drafts and exchange them for feedback before writing the finished versions, so this would be a good chance to connect with a proofreading buddy.\n\n# Supplemental Input\n\nI'm not an anime person, a J-drama person, a gaming person - I went from four years of my career taking up all of my time to suddenly being back in school and realizing that I had absolutely no hobbies other than trying to learn Japanese every now and then. I started school last September and was immediately falling behind every single one of my peers, totally unable to understand why they were picking up every new concept so quickly and I was struggling so hard. So in December, I finally caved and went to my professor's office hours to ask what I could do to improve. She was incredibly nice, didn't speak detrimentally about my (lack of) supplemental input at all, but mentioned quite slyly that she can always tell when her students watch anime or play Japanese games or anything of that sort because their vocabularies are so strong. I thanked her and left.\n\n**Comprehensible Input** \\- r/LearnJapanese loves to use this phrase, but it really is a truth bomb. The input you get (listening, reading) must be at a comprehensible level for you or else you're just nodding along to gibberish that your brain can't parse. Sitting a baby down in front of A Brief History Of Time won't help them any more than it will help me to watch someone on Terrace House have an emotional breakdown and rapidly word-vomit their life story when I don't have subtitles on. It just won't make sense at that stage.\n\nIf you're at a mid-Genki II level like me (this is N4 area), here is what I'm using as my comprehensible input:\n\n* **Anime**: Cardcaptor Sakura, Doraemon, Inuyasha (this one is a bit of a struggle but quite fun)\n* **Games**: Ni no Kuni I (has furigana, really loving this game), Toho Mystia's Izakaya (tough but fun)\n* **Manga**: Yotsuba&amp; (I know this is everyone's rec but it's so cute), Sailor Moon (tough but FAVE)\n* **Books**: Anything from the 小学生なら366 series (like [this](https://united-states.kinokuniya.com/bw/9784092272101)), Detective Conan's 1026 Kanji Practice ([here](https://united-states.kinokuniya.com/bw/9784092272422))\n\n# Outside Learning\n\nMy professor didn't mention extending lessons beyond class, homework, and casual input because that's already MANY hours being dedicated to Japanese for a full-time student. However, if you've been on r/LearnJapanese for a while, you've assuredly heard of both of these websites. And once I started using them, they became the secret weapons that took me from last place in the class to, like, third place. Which is a huge jump, thank you very much, I'm very proud.\n\n**WaniKani** \\- I was frustrated with this at first, being that I'm working on N4 and starting WaniKani means beginning at pre-N5 kanji. However, once you work on it for about a week, you will immediately begin learning additional kanji information, and the SRS has made me an incredibly fast reader. I went from being embarrassed about reading aloud in class to being able to read quickly without stumbling over any kanji. Genuinely not trying to gloat, though I am proud of my progress, I'm just literally amazed at how quickly this website made a huge change in my reading ability. \n\n**Bunpro** \\- Bun and Wani are a match made in heaven. I don't use Bunpro every day like I do with WaniKani, but it is invaluable extra practice for my Genki grammar whenever I have chapter tests on the horizon. I went from trembling with anxiety over my tests for DAYS beforehand to showing up casually 5 mins early with boba, not a care in the world because I knew I would pass. If I didn't have a lecture class teaching me new grammar points, Bunpro would be my daily lesson spot. Super highly recommended for all learners.\n\n# Let's Summarize\n\nSo, in total, here is what we're looking at for each of the four categories of language learning using only university class time and assigned homework as our guide (this does not include anime or WK or anything extra):\n\n* **Reading**: 4 hr/wk (Class, Workbook, Reading Comp)\n* **Listening**: 5 hr/wk (Class, Conversation, Listening Comp)\n* **Speaking**: 3 hr/wk (Class, Conversation)\n* **Writing**: 4 hr/wk (Class, Workbook, Conjugations, Particles, Writing Projects)\n\nThese all have a bit of overlap with each other since classes are a mix of all four. If you add in an hour of additional input and learning per day, you're looking at about 17 hours per week being exclusively spent on Japanese. If you keep it up, that's nearly 900 hours of Japanese learning in a year.\n\n\"University classes teach slowly!!!1\" Yes, we're not gonna reach N2 in 60 days, because students (and people with full-time jobs) must also split their time with other vital tasks. This is not a fast enough pace for someone trying to hit N1 by the end of their first year of learning - if you are a self-studier with other things going on in your life, I feel like this can still be considered an ambitious pace.\n\nThank you for reading this far, also. If you think this post sucks, that's totally fine. But I searched far and wide for this information when I was studying at home and couldn't find anything similar, so I hope this at least helps at least one other self-studier who isn't trying to go back to school just to have a regimented learning routine lol\n\nGood luck, self-studiers. 頑張ろう!",

However, I wish there was a way for me to select words I don't know and deselect words I know and randomize the order they are being pronounced in, rather than just listening to the same sequence of each lesson.\n\nI bought Genki Vocabulary app hoping that it will have it. It indeed has a flashcard system, however there is no autoplay and you have to interact with each word every time. And I sometimes don't have the ability to do that and just want to drill the words when I'm doing something. And sometimes I do want to interact with them to tell the system how well I remember it for it to update in what sequence it's feeding stuff to me.\n\nDoes Anki have that ability? From what I've seen it doesn't look like it... If I am wrong let me know! I will be super happy. Otherwise, is there an app that does what I have described?\n\nThanks for your time, guys!",

Not sure if this alludes to anything.\n\nMore importantly is the final title \"dono\" which I translated with \"Mister\" (different from Mr.).\"Dono\" is different from what kanji, meaning \"lord\" implies. \"dono\" at the end of a name is very pejorative, like looking down on the person.

It's an important term throughout the game.\n\nクソ野郎 /クソさ: Kuso (kanji: 糞) means shit and is used in lots of different expressions, including Kusoyarou meaning \"shitty person\" or \"bastard\".

        "text": "Hello, I’m currently self-learning Japanese and will be minoring in TESOL when I get to college this fall. I’ll be learning Japanese (duh), and I will have a chance to study abroad in Japan; which I’m going to take obviously, how could I turn that down, it’s a beautiful country. Anyway, it’s pretty well known that usually in Asia people comment on weight often, including Japan. I’m pretty big. I’m 5’4” and 250lbs, which is most certainly considered obese. Since that’s obese here in America, I can’t even begin to imagine what it would be considered in Japan lol And what’s even worse is that there are people wayyy bigger than me here in America too. But, anyway, I’m not going to blame my weight completely on my health conditions and medications, but truthfully a lot of it is because of such things. I have hypothyroidism which makes it almost impossible to lose weight in my scenario. Not only that but I also have an eating disorder that causes me to overeat at times, and I’ve been on a plethora of medications that unfortunately have side effects such as weight gain. I was already a bigger person before my health declined, but I have gained about 90lbs ever since this all started. I don’t exactly take being called fat very lightly unfortunately, and so I’m very worried about going to Japan. I’ve looked up how other people deal with being called fat over there, but I’m wondering if there are other ways to respond. Most people say to just laugh it off or make a joke about it, which I could do, but it would be difficult and I’d rather explain that I’m fat because of health problems. How would a Japanese person respond if I told them that it’s because of my health and isn’t entirely my fault? I read something saying that Japanese people “cringe” at such excuses, but is it really an excuse if it’s true? I don’t want them to cringe and think I’m just some obese American with no self control making up excuses. But I’d also rather be honest about it instead of just laughing it off as others have recommended. What do you think I should do if I encounter such a situation while I’m there?",

        "text": "Okay okay I know I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion but before anyone throws pitchforks at me, I promise I have a good reason.\n\nI know language learning is not a race nor is it conducive or productive or anywhere useful to rush learning a language. BUT there is graduation + scholarship on the line here, so I hope you understand.\n\nMy school/major requires a second language for me to graduate, and Japanese was my choice (I do know another language but it wasn't approved(?)). I passed N5 so I'm technically all-clear for graduation. However, there's a scholarship + other major perks for anyone who can reach N1. That scholarship could pay off a huge chunk of my education loans. We also get a free trip to Japan. I'm also applying for professional schools next year, and a third language would bring my prospects up. I need the piece of paper before everything else which I know is awful (and I feel bad even typing it), but such is life sometimes.\n\nUnfortunately, I currently work at a hospital as a researcher (yes I went to school + worked at the same time) so I can't do a complete immersion. However, being a good student is my specialty—I love learning and I'm consistent in my work. I also attended the top university in my country and graduated in the top 5 for my major so I'm confident I can do well with a bit of guidance and direction. I'm used to working 8 hrs then studying for 6 at home, but I've actually finished most of my graduation required courses and mostly work now, so schoolwork is not an issue. I have a little over a year left.\n\n—\n\nWhen I took N5, all I had was Genki I and RTK (\\~300) and 20 years of anime. I took N5 maybe 4-5 years ago so it's been a while—all that's really changed is that I have Genki I (reviewed it after hearing about the competition) + RTK (\\~600).\n\nI've read many posts (including Jazzy and Doth's journey) but I'd be curious to hear about what others have done to streamline this process as much as I can. I know realistically the N1 will probably not happen, but my pen has always been my sword and I'd regret losing this opportunity. I know language acquisition is not a race but I hope everyone understands why it is for me, in just this instance.",

I'm currently on level 14 of WaniKani and decided to start working on grammar so I can actually use what I've learned.  I want to just use youtube so I found some playlists/ channels and wanted to know what you guys thought.\n\nFirst, I wanted to go through [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5-Wp_4tLqZor0fbsXtP7t6npWeE-2IU) from Japanese Ammo with Misa while also going through [this one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA_RcUI8km1NMhiEebcbqdlcHv_2ngbO2) from ToKini Andy.  I may also use ToKini Andys' [Genki 2 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA_RcUI8km1P8bJzp3_TMMv1jhL3BcKQk) after but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen after finishing those I wanted to use  [三本塾 -Sambon Juku-](https://www.youtube.com/@sambonjuku/featured) and  [日本語の森](https://www.youtube.com/@nihongonomori2013) (I haven't looked up any actual playlists for them, I just saw them mentioned in other posts about grammar and wrote them down.)  After that, I'm not really sure what to do besides just keep reading and watching content to learn more.\n\nAlso, not really related to grammar but I wanted to use [あかね的日本語教室](https://www.youtube.com/@Akane-JapaneseClass) for listening/ a little reading practice since she records herself having actual interactions and doing things around japan.\n\nSo yeah, is there anyone else that I should use that you guys recommend?  Is there anyone on this list that isn't as good and I shouldn't use?  I appreciate any feedback!",

All dialogue occurs in chat bubbles so you can take as long as you need to decipher sentences before clicking next. The language is not too complex or filled with slang but it’s also not for children so it doesn’t leave out kanji. \n\nThe game also has a nice balance between dialogue heavy parts and long stretches of gameplay with no writing at all, so you can take a break without getting overwhelmed.\n\nIt’s also very charming and fun. You play as a cat in a post apocalyptic world where humans have died out and robots live in the ruins of their civilization.",

I just have a question about the usage of ore specifically.\n\nIn a show I'm watching, a character that doesn't seem much like the \"ore\" type almost exclusively uses \"ore\". I know ore can range from kind of a tough guy pronoun to a default older man pronoun depending on the area/situation, but sometimes I still get confused about it. The show the chatacter is from doesn't have a very large English speaking audience, let alone a bilingual people, and I've seen multiple people question the implications his pronoun choice has on his characterization.\n\nThe character in question is a caregiver/protector type of figure who generally does anything he can to serve people, going so far as to get on his knees to speak to them. He often comes off as a bit naive. He fights sometimes and proves that he's a very good fighter and has a strict code of honor, yet he lets himself get beat up frequently by the person he is sworn to protect. I take him as more of a \"watashi\" type, yet he always uses \"ore\", even when talking to superiors.\n\nCan I get some cultural context to this? I might be overthinking it and it really is just meant to be a neutral pronoun in this case, lol. I hadn't even noticed it until someone else brought it up. How much characterization have I been missing out on by not paying attention to pronouns?",

I'd like to be able to go through the words in Anki, and then watch the episode, confident that I at least vaguely know the meaning of every single word.\n\nBut as it turns out, going over my 8k or so word list and adding every unknown one to Anki would be quite a slog, so I was wondering if there was a way I could just throw the whole thing into Yomichan or some other app and have it generate cards, complete with readings and dictionnary definitions, automatically.",

In these classes, we studied mostly Genki and in my final class a bit of Tobira. Just by taking Nihongo classes, I managed to pass the N4 JLPT, but I never got around to studying for and taking the N3 exam because I had already graduated, had to get a job, and basically life got in the way. Plus, I kind of doubted my ability to pass the N3 especially since it would have to be through self-study, and not a class.\n\nThat was about 6 or 7 years ago, so my Nihongo basically stagnated since I stopped studying. I tried to keep it fresh by sometimes writing my journals in ウルトラ優しい日本語ww but it wasn't really growing my proficiency, it was just some form of self-consolation that I still retained some of what I learned. \n\nThis year, I really want to set N3 as a goal, and I finally have the time to study for it because life is a little less in the way. Is it a good idea to just start all over again from Genki I &amp; II? Are there any other resources that might work for a not-quite noob like me? I would say my current proficiency level is that if I had to take the N4 right now, I'd have an okay chance of passing it, but not in a million years could I pass N3 without a lot of studying. \n\nAny advice is appreciated :-)",

I think I get that from the examples usually given in textbooks. One example sentence where I'm having a bit more trouble is the following:\n\n経験でしか人は学ぶことはできないんだ。\nMan learns from experience alone.\n\n\nI spoke to some native Japanese speakers about this and the sentence seemed quite natural to them. I wanted to turn this into a sentence using だけ and the sentence they came up with was:\n\n\n経験からのみ人は学ぶことができる。\n\n\nThe explanation was that だけ couldn't be used because it must follow a noun. My search on the internet only mentioned that のみ was more formal then だけ, not that it could be used differently grammatically. \n \nSo my questions here are:\n1. What are your thoughts on the original sentence using しか? Does it have a negative nuance to you? The English translation does not carry a negative nuance to me.\n\n2. Can anyone provide any additional information about the differences between だけ and のみ?\n\nThanks for your help.",

Maybe it's because I'm thinking of them incorrectly, but they don't seem to capture the nuance of what I am trying to communicate. For 2 examples:\n\nWhen I want to say \"I voted in an election\" -  選挙で投票しました。- is で correct in this scenario? To me, it's where the action took place? Am I thinking of this wrong?\n\nFor a slightly more complicated example from my homework, when I want to say \"voting is a privilege that some people have forgotten about -  選挙権は特権だについて人々はわすれています。- Is this correct? google docs is telling me that \"nitsuite\" should be replaced with と, but this doesn't seem right to me. Can と mean \"that\" (as in something *that* we have forgotten about)? I should also note that I used \"nitsuite\" to say \"about which,\" but I'm not sure that's right either.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, as well as any resources on understanding particles better!\n\nThank you!!",

        "text": "I’m a beginner. I was feeling conflicted (and still kinda am) on how to start learning kanji.\n\nWhat I’m currently doing is: learning kanji as I learn vocabulary. I downloaded an app to make japanese friends, they’ve been super nice to me and a lot of them offered to help me with japanese, so besides using some other apps (mostly benkyō and memrise) to learn kanji and vocabulary, I also started talking to some native speakers in japanese and as we have conversations I write down the new vocabulary in a notebook. \n\nFor example yesterday I was talking to a guy and I wanted to say that I was happy, so I looked it up and learned about 嬉しい and 幸せ, I wrote down in my notebook their meaning, stroke order, radicals/parts and an exemple of how they can be used in a sentence. \n\nIt does work as I memorize them but I feel like it’s a slow method cause I see some people say they can learn tons of kanji in a day?!! Which I don’t with this method.\n\nSo am I wasting my time by doing this?",

Somehow I feel like I can study by myself, I would like to study with someone and exchange questions, help each other out, practice vocabulary and grammar, etc. \n\nIf you are interested please let me know, or if you have a group that I can join I’ll be grateful. \n\nAlso, i’m a beginner. I don’t mind starting from zero.",
