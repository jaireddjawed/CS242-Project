        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if that fits here\n\nIt just some fancy mindwandering, but i spoke with some people about this, but they were not able to be exicted about this idea, but i guess i probably also came off wrong, since i suck at expressing myself, but who knows maybe someone on here will find this idea appealing, its just a wishful, fancy idea so dont take it too serious) I often think humanity should become a collective, a singularity of minds. Probably not what you think and not like in a dystopia. Personally i am not much, i am not smart, but i would like to strive for something great, but not  being a narcissistic tendency. I want Humanity to become a Singularity.\n\nMore realistic step: I would like to live with other people as a sort of collective, with the only purpose of advancing humanity and retributing equality, good living conditions, prosocial behaviour, empathy and admiration for life in general, as first step. We need the \"humaneness\" in humanity. That would also mean , that we as species, must overcome our individualism, our flaws like greed, desire for power or individual desires and become more or less a commonly thinking construct of minds: We should be more than what our monkey minds and organic vessels are capable of. Absolute knowledge, unbroken unity and the ability to master that what we know as our universe should be the goal, whatever comes after this decision? Would we be gods? Create a new Universe? Or create myriads of universes? i am certain that the minds of so many people combined can become something great, something that is able to solve literally every problem, eventually something that will create worlds, seed life and withstand millenias, maybe even create new Dimensions, truly knowing the essence of what makes our Universe, become a Singularity.\n\nI often think about this, and how it would be, it is obviously not comprehendable, but i think it would be a logical next step in Evolution on a large, major scale. From first molecules, single celled life, multicellular creatures, sentience and finally a stage of Singularity. I wish i could express my idea more, but i think most people probably get what i am trying to mean, i dont mean a hivemind that is controlled by some corrupt individual or have humans as living corpses or whatever, but one that is beyond what we comprehend, more or less god like, immortal and omnipresent.\n\nI have no idea why i am fascinated by this idea, but maybe due to my neurodivergencies i already dont quite feel very individualistic but rather altruistic, or not sure if that is the right word, but i often think how others would feel about something before i feel about how i feel about it? My mood is also often dependant on how people around me behave or feel, but generally i feel neutral most of times, never truly happy or truly depressed or angry. I am also sometimes to see myself in the mirror or realize that i am alive, it feels kinda weird to be an individual? Even as child i was often unsure about my own emotions, however i was/am very capable of relating to others or feel empathy with them and guess how they felt.\n\nSo what you think? Potential pathway for humanity? Terrible idea? Could it work out like i envision it? Or would it be a total disaster? Like a huge amoebe with no intelligence left? Total Chaos? Or something we cannot even comprehend yet?",

Let us assume we are the minimum amount of \"years down the line\" to be able to mine minerals and other materials in space. What type of storage on a space station or facility would you use to store it? Currently it appears that transporting minerals to space from earth and from space to earth is more expensive than gathering it in space and utilizing it there right? If that is the case, what type of container or storage would you use? Before asking this question I did a bit of googling around. I searched for industrial ice storage to get an idea of how we do it on earth but it really only netted me large sized ice machines outside your local convenience store. I ask because I'm curious about how we would continually provide oxygen for space stations. A storage container of ice which feeds to machinery that uses electrolysis to extract oxygen and then feeds it to storage/station?",
