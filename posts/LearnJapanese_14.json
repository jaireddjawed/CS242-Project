        "text": "When I heard Japanese doesn’t have a future tense, I thought well ok English doesn’t really either. There’s no verb change based on future anyway, you just add the word “will.” Then I learned that Japanese doesn’t even have that, that the present/future tense are just kind of the same. Saying “taberu” can mean both “I eat” and “I will eat.” My question is how often do people do that? Say they will do something just by saying the infinitive? From what I’ve read, darou kind of works as a future tense at times. Of course the verb Ikiru (to go) can be used as a more immediate future tense as it would in any language. It seems to me that the verb naru also can express future, though I don’t really know the rules on that one.",

Some friends and I were at a local cafe and my Japanese teacher stood in line to order food. She asked me if I actually enjoyed the type of food they served, and I exclaimed I did. \"Goti-soo-samadesu!\" I said with a triumphant smile.   \nShe burst out laughing hearing that, and we soon after parted ways. I had plenty of chances to clarify it with her or other teachers but never did. Didn't I say \"It's a treat!\"? Perhaps my teacher was surprised to hear me use a word we hadn't directly studied/used in the classroom, or can you not use that word like that? It felt intuitive enough, deshita=passed tense so desu=present.   \nThank you/doomo arigatoo",

I am getting a bit frustrated and I have to do extra work to understand their way of teaching compared to what I learned before. \n\nI am looking for any tips or advice from someone who went through the same thing.

Verbatim takes what you already know in your target language(s) and generates personalized content based off of your level.\n\nWho is this for?\n\n* All levels, from beginner-intermediate-advanced\n\nWhy did I create this?\n\n* I’ve been re-learning two languages for a year. I’ve used a handful of resources from audiobooks, text books and apps at different stages in my own journey and for different purposes. While there are great options out there, much of my frustrations were around the fact that some felt either like too much of a game rather than a tool for learning, or that the resources were a mismatch for my level for different reasons. Hence, why I have a rotation of multiple resources on hand at all times.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* It starts with a short, but important assessment test to determine your level\n* The words used throughout the assessment are collected and grouped based on (1) if you know it, (2) if you seem to be familiar with it but not have a full grasp on it or (3) need to learn it\n* The page generates content in the form of clips, headlines, and articles using the words and phrases you know with words you might be familiar with and words you need to learn\n* As you review the content, you and Verbatim learn together and as your learning progresses, more content becomes generated based on where you are at in your language learning journey\n\nI’ve designed a landing page and sign up for those interested in being part of the early release beta while I continue developing this tool. \n\nIf you’re interested, feel free to check it out: [https://verbatim.unicornplatform.page](https://verbatim.unicornplatform.page/)",

And when I logged in it has ~600 words in my to learn list that are all basic. I want to know how to add courses (and which courses to add) so that the app will include all JLPT words N5-N1 in my lessons, so that I can just gradually work through thousands of words until I've covered all JLPT words. I also would prefer to study from sentences instead of individual words if I can, and it looks to me like there's a way to save sentences in Renshuu but I can't figure out how.\n\nI'm upper beginner/low intermediate in Japanese and already know ~2000 words, enough to read slice of life manga and play video games I'm familiar with in Japanese. Satori Reader's graded reader material is just a bit above my comfortable comprehension level so it works very well for me. I think Renshuu potentially could be very useful because I could study another 2000-4000 words with it with sentence examples and audio in a nice lesson structure like memrise (which I like) but without memrise's awful audio ads. But I currently only have ~600 words on my accounts to learn list that are words I already know, and I don't know how to change this to the thousands of words I do need to learn. \n\nRenshuu seems useful I'm just really confused about how to add things to your to-learn Dashboard area to study. The layout of the app regarding adding stuff to study, seeing what is in your currently-studying collection, and selecting what stuff to study within the stuff you saved, is all a bit confusing to me.",

Once I've got that, I'm going to sift through Tofugu articles for more information as well.\n\n\nI'm planning to include overviews of different ways to express a concept (e.g. Expressing Uncertainty with だろう、かもしれない、etc.) and then making notes on how those expressions differ in their nuances (e.g. degree of certainty, written/spoken Japanese, formal/informal Japanese etc.). Not really sure yet how to best organise the information (perhaps in categories, e.g. \"Particles\", \"こそあど words\", \"auxiliary verbs\" etc.?)\n\nIt's gonna be quite the undertaking, but I don't mind. Anyone has got some tips on other good Grammar Resources to pull from? Or any ideas how to organize/structure the information and what information to include? That would be really helpful :)",

I was considering speed running a core 6k deck by doing like 50 new cards a day since I have 2 hours most days where it's inconvenient to use anything other than anki (commute, breaks at work etc..)\n\nMy main concern is that right now I don't know any kanji so I am afraid it might make it very difficult to navigate the core decks. Should I still go for it? I've also read about a lot of different vocab decks like Tango or Nayr's Core5k. Which route might be the best for my goals? Also, how can I supplement this vocab grinding with kanji since I don't want to just ignore it or put it off. Should I also do RTK in parallel or some other kanji resource, or just brute force the learning kanji via the vocab? Any thoughts appreciated!",

([Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.immersely.immersely) | [App store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1628381103))\n\nMany of you are familiar with input hypothesis, Stephen Krashen (the legend), and immersion. For those of you that aren’t - basically your brain acquires a language through lots of comprehensible exposure over time. In other words - you need context to understand a language.\n\nThe problem is that there isn’t an easy way to get comprehensible input.\n\nThis is what Umi is trying to solve. We’ve taken hundreds of TV shows and movies, cut them into clips, then teach words based on how frequent each word was used.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to have a clip database large enough that we can organize with n+1 sentences (where the only unknown word in each clip is the target word). Right now we have over 10,000 clips for 4000 target words just for Japanese with plans to expand to 10,000 words.\n\nThe app is free (although we run an ad at the end of each lesson, which is 5 words and 15 clips). There’s a built-in SRS review system. We’re improving the app weekly.\n\nWould love to get some feedback from the community on what we’re doing right and what could be improved.\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10ohg1c/struggling_to_memorize_vocab_even_with_flash/",
        "text": "Flash cards, especially spaced-repetition flash card apps like Anki, are widely recommended for memorizing vocab.\n\nSome learners thrive with flash cards. For others though, flash cards can be a struggle. Even with just a small number of words, it can feel like nothing ever sticks. This can lead to frustration, stress, and giving up.\n\nIf you experience ADHD or dyslexia, it’s less likely that rote memorization via flash cards will be an easy process.\n\nFor those learners, is all hope lost? Not at all; flash cards are still a highly effective tool, when paired with the memorization technique known as **mnemonics**. This may already be a familiar technique for a lot of people here, but with mnemonics, we pair an image that appears very readily in our minds, with the actual definition.\n\nLet’s look at およぐ (oyogu), meaning “swim”. What does “oyogu” sound like to you? Some beginners I’ve worked with think it sounds like “ogre”, or “yogurt”. Anything is fine, as long as it comes quickly to your mind.\n\nThen, pair that word or image with “swim”. You might imagine an ogre swimming in a swamp; or a person swimming in a pool of yogurt! Nothing is too absurd or too silly.\n\nWhen you see およぐ (oyogu) again, and that image of an ogre swimming or a pool of yogurt comes to mind, you’ll remember “swim”! I’ve worked with beginners who felt ready to give up on flash cards, grow their vocab into several hundreds of words by using this technique.\n\nOther mnemonics I’ve seen used effectively include:\n\nおそい (osoi, slow/late): Sounds like “oh sorry”, like “Oh, sorry I’m **late**.” \n\nのむ (nomu, drink): Sounds like “no m(ore)”: “No more **drinks** for me, thanks!”\n\nがっこう (gakkou, school): Sounds like “gotta go”, and you’ve gotta go to **school**!\n\nこうえん (kouen, park): Sounds like “go in”, and you can “go in the **park**.”\n\nほん (hon, book): With a **book**, you can “hone” your skills!\n\nThese are just examples. The mnemonics that work best for your individual mind will vary.\n\nIf you’ve struggled with flash cards in the past, don’t give up! Use them with mnemonics, and watch as your Japanese vocabulary grows and grows. If anyone here has used mnemonics before, do you remember any of your favorites that have been helpful for you?",

I’m going through the Genki 1 book and doing each chapter multiple times so that I can truly understand the material. When I’m feeling confident with the spellings of the words in hiragana, I go on Jisho to find the kanji equivalent. I then do the chapter one last time but incorporating the kanji instead of the hiragana. It helps me solidify the vocab while also learning new Kanji. However, some of the Kanji are N3 and up. Which I don’t mind learning but was wondering if it would be detrimental in the long run.",

        "text": "Hi, guys. I'd like to do this post here, I'm afraid they may sound pretty boring, though. It's specially for native japanese speakers, but also for whoever knows something or is interested about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have basically 4 works here to compare: \n\n1) 齋藤 愼爾's 陸沈 (saitou shinji's work Rikuchin), \n\n2) noh plays (specially, aoinoue), \n\n3) natsume souseki's sore kara,\n\n4) ryuunousuke akutagawa's jigokuhen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I know just \"tepid tea\" japanese, that is, I'm interested in the language for years, know some, but actually never made a formal course nor learned systematically, so I'm pretty dumb, but also dead curious about it. Specially in recent years. So, I tried many things on the language, and I'd like to discuss some things and make some questions for those who know better.\n\nOk, here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; I notice that these works actually show a history of japanese language. I got profoundly admired and astonished, because I never thought of a language like that. I mean, my native language has its classics, but I actually never payed attention to them before, and I actually started paying attention after that. I love Steins;Gate, but when I compare its language, and anime language, to any of these works, it's like a whole different language. And that's amazing actually! How do you guys feel about it? Is it too weird to read haiku, noh plays, 20th century literature? \n\nFor native speakers: Are they commonly read? Do you guys read them at school?\n\n\\-&gt; Ok, so one other thing that shocked me. Akutagawa and Souseki's languages vary WAY TOO MUCH. I mean, reading (never finished though of course lol) sore kara felt more natural, informal. Then Akutagawa's jigokuhen feels like I'm reading something overly formal, it has a lot of honorific forms and so on, and yet, somehow, it feels like it's supposed to be informal. Do you guys know why this happen? Is it writing style? Is it keigo? Is it different types of japanese use because of the place they lived? I don't know how to correctly phrase this feeling I have, but, for instance, aozora may help me. Here:\n\n1) 堀川の大殿様おほとのさまのやうな方は、これまでは固もとより、後の世には恐らく二人とはいらつしやいますまい。噂に聞きますと、あの方の御誕生になる前には、大威徳明王だいゐとくみやうおうの御姿が御母君おんはゝぎみの夢枕にお立ちになつたとか申す事でございますが\n\n\\[irasshaimasu mai; kikimasu to; the use ofゝ; de gozaimasu\\] This language feels older than it should. Keep in mind I have no idea what is happening over there, I'd need to look into a dictionary for almost every word lol So it may be about a story that happened 100 years before the time Akutagawa wrote or something.\n\n2) 誰か慌あわただしく門前を馳かけて行く足音がした時、代助だいすけの頭の中には、大きな俎下駄まないたげたが空くうから、ぶら下っていた。けれども、\n\n\\[that feels almost like today's language, but slightly more precise, I'd say\\].\n\nCould you guys explain me what is this difference? They wrote at the same epoch, so I got really, really curious about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; Then we have this. I have rikuchin here with me, I'm in love with this book. But oh boy, I read it in pain lol I mean, I'll post 2 examples. I love those haiku, but I got deeply confused. Even Shinji's name is complicated (and beautiful), imagine his words.\n\n血をうすく / 眠るや吾れの / 涅槃変 \\[chi wo usuku / nemuru ya ware no / nehan-hen\\]\n\n末黒野に / 天降りし瓦礫 / 涅槃像 \\[sugurono ni / amori shi gareki / nehan-zou\\]\n\nDo you guys understand this? What would you tell me about these haikus? Is this instantly readable for a native speaker or it would need some dictionary?\n\n(In my view, haikus, specially like Saitou Shinji's, need not only to look for the word, but a lot of words it suggests. So I basically entered in a lot of buddhism terms, and that was deeply interesting too).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; I know I've asked too much, but last question. This may sound weirder. It's optional. But, again, I'm really, really curious. I noticed, specially trying to read Souseki's \"yume juuya\", that the japanese language seemed rooted in buddhism tradition, plus chinese tradition, specially taoism. It's just a feeling though, of course, but it came from the fact whenever I looked for words in works like the ones I quoted, I soon get into something like \"仏教語\" or something. I don't know any name of recent japanese cultural names, except for Natsuishi Ban'ya and Saitou Shinji, but in pop culture, it feels like these roots just vanished. Anime for me sounds like \"存在の証明\", \"私は誰だ\", \"ぶっ倒す\", \"殺してやる\". More physical and psychological, while before was more spiritual or something, I don't know. I feel two expressions, like \"ざまみろ\" or \"自業自得\", which feels buddhistic, but I don't know. Anyway, do you guys feel that too? \n\nAlso, could you guys recommend me works like the equivalent of classic literature, but with contemporary authors? I'd love to know them. Ban'ya I felt weird lol I've heard more about the \"空飛ぶ法皇\"'s work, and it felt more a formal practice than a real work of haiku, like Saitou Shinji (which is maybe 90 years-old or something). I also heard about Natsui Itsuki, she seems like a great lady, but more of a teacher than of a producer of haiku. Also, I'd like some fiction work, and I know no'ne. Don't take me bad, I think Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an immense work, plus Higurashi Kai and Umineko Chiru, and yet, I'd like to hear about some of the \"old school\" type of literature, produced more recently. Could you guys recommend me some?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for the size of the post, and I know it's probably boring and so on, but I appreciate your patience, and, if I deserve it, your answers. Thanks in advance. よろしくおねがいします",

It's the one saving grace I feel like I can scrape off of this failure lol.\n\nBut I digress, I'm now studying harder than ever. Gonna read more because clearly that's what I need to focus on. Just read a shit ton, increase reading speed and comprehension, and while I'm at it increase vocab and grammar as well.\n\nSince I'm in the states I can only take this exam once a year which is annoying, but I'm going to use that time to completely shatter N2. Ultimate goal is to already be studying N1 material by the end of this year. I want the next N2 exam to be so easy I finish that shit without breaking a sweat. \n\nAnd while I am frustrated about failing, to be honest even if I'd pass I don't think I could be proud of a score below 110/180. I do intend to use this cert to get back to Japan so I need to go all out. Probably gonna sign up for regular speech classes on italki while I'm at it as well. I did it once for interview practice in Japanese and had a really good experience.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to post this in case anyone else was also discouraged from failing.

        "author": "urgod42069",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10nqjzk/can_someone_please_help_me_decipher_this_dialogue/",
        "text": "If you haven’t seen Breaking Bad + Better Call Saul please turn back, both are great (Better Call Saul being my personal favorite) and you should totally watch them!\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you’ve either seen them already or don’t really care if you see a spoiler, I’m a bit lost on what the character in this clip says around 3 minutes in: \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wuqeRb47BFk\n\n\nIn the original English audio, he says &gt;!“Jimmy, you can’t help yourself. Chuck knew it. You were born that way.”!&lt;\n\n\nFor some small context if you haven’t seen the show and have no intention to, &gt;!Chuck is Jimmy’s deceased older brother, who always was on his case and believed he was incapable of change and was always going to be cutting corners and scamming people rather than playing things by the book. Howard, the speaker, was a close friend of Chuck’s and, while he had his own (mostly positive) view of Jimmy, he deferred to Chuck’s POV often, and he’s now antagonizing Jimmy after getting conned by him, basically saying Chuck was right about him all along!&lt;\n\nThe Japanese subtitles for those lines read 「チャックは知ってた。君は自制できない。生まれつきだ。」which I read as basically &gt;!“Chuck knew it, you aren’t able to control yourself. Born that way.”!&lt; Pretty much the same.\n\nNow, I’ve done my best to try and figure out what he’s *actually* saying aloud, and the best I can do (for the first 2 lines) is:\n\n「ジミーは自制しがない。チャックは知ってた。」\n\nThe third line is where I’m lost. I know it’s supposed to mean something *equivalent* to “you were born that way” but what I hear is 「そういうさだっと」. From there (this is the reason why the context I mentioned earlier might be relevant) I was like, “oh, maybe the と is making it into a quote, like he’s reciting something &gt;!Chuck would always say in reference to Jimmy!&lt;, and the だ is marking the end of the quote”. So I then interpreted it as \n\n「そういうさだ。」っと。\n\nBut what the hell does that mean? I tried to figure out what さ was as a stand-alone word but nothing made a lot of sense. Is it 「差」? And then it’s like he’s saying “That was the difference”? That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. Or is it like 「そう言う」like “said that __” 「さだっと」(no clue what that is..? Maybe it’s using grammar I don’t know yet?)\n\n\nI still have a LOT of room for improvement when it comes to transcribing Japanese audio, so maybe someone much more practiced could listen to that line and understand it immediately, and I’m missing something sorta obvious. I honestly think the subtitle for that line works a lot better than whatever it is he’s saying, because 「生まれつきだ。」feels as dismissive and cutting as the &gt;!“you were born that way” (echoing his brother’s hateful sentiment, if not directly quoting him)!&lt; in the original.\n\n\nI really appreciate the help, to anyone who does. Thank you!",

You don’t have to learn a stroke order to learn kanji… but is it helpful? I would say yes. \n\nStroke order takes maybe a few days to get down (it really isn’t complicated), and in my experience, —I can only really speak from experience here, will help you learn kanji more easily as you will be better able to comprehend the components of a kanji and in turn, more easily ‘recall’ that kanji which will, in turn… help you to memorize it. \n\nFrom what I can observe with my own studies knowing stroke order will help to speed up the process of learning kanji and in the long run will outweigh whatever time you spend on learning it in the first place.\n\n(Also, It really helps when looking up kanji you see somewhere but don’t know)\n\nAnyway, that’s just my 2 cents on kanji and stroke order, nothing scientific or anything just what I’ve learned in my 3ish years experience with this language. And keep with it too this gets more fun as you grow. 頑張って",

I also searched r/LearnJapanese for \"computer game\". \n\n**Other details:** I'm afraid I don't have any, my apologies. Thank you for your time!",

Despite being written in simple language I intend to make the stories genuinely entertaining. Ideally even people who are fluent in Japanese would enjoy reading them.\n\n- Why do I do that ?\n\nBecause I can.\n\n\n- What’s my inspiration ?\n\nI am a Final Fantasy fan, especially the old ones : FF6 &amp; FF7. \n\n\n- In what type of world to the stories take place ?\n\nThe stories take place in a typical fantasy world quite close to FF6. The one thing that makes it unique is that this world features a technology that allows people to communicate remotely and form some sort of social networks.\n\n\n- What’s my timeline ?\n\nAt the time of writing I’ve been working on it on and off for 2/3 years or so and I expect the project to be achievable within a decade.\n\n\n- Am I a native speaker ?\n\nI’m not. My Japanese is not even great. However I pay a freelancer to proofread my work and make the Japanese sound natural (she does wonders!). I actually believe being a learner helps as I know which words tend to be learnt first.\n\nI hope you enjoy them !",
