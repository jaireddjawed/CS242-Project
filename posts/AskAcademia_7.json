He has approached me yesterday if I can help him with publishing his ‘last ideas/theories’. I have read it and it’s very well written and interesting. He was thinking that I can add him as an adjunct to our department but I know that this is not an easy undertaking and will probably not be approved anyway. So he has no affiliation.  The question is how can he publish his ‘last work’ without affiliation ? I thought of self publishing or a blog etc but I don’t think he is understanding this concept (do I get a reprint?). Any ideas welcomed. Thank you.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! I would appreciate any of your advice/suggestions regarding my future career path as I’m quite confused and frustrated at the moment. Let me describe the scenario what I’m facing right now. \n\nI completed my PhD in mathematical sciences with specialisation in statistics from one of the UK’s top university a couple of weeks ago. Before starting my PhD, I’ve got about five years teaching and supervising experience at a university level in a South Asian country (not comfortable to name the country). I enjoy teaching and research, so I want to remain in academia. Regarding academia my priority countries are the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. For a lecturer or assistant professors positions, most of the universities in those countries require a strong research profile. However, I do not have any publications from my thesis since it’s not the requirement for the degree (and because my supervisor also advised me to write a good thesis instead of my putting efforts in publications, so I don’t wanted to annoy them). I am sure that without a strong publication record, I won’t get any academic position in any of the above mentioned countries. So establishing my research profile, I want to do postdoc. When I shared this with my supervisor, they said that you most likely won’t get it until you have at least one good publication. Now I am down since the last week and cursing myself for no getting a single publication. I feel like I’m not progression in my professional life despite passing my PhD viva a couple of weeks ago. So I need your advice or opinion regarding the following. \n\n(a) I definitely want to do postdoc. But I perhaps won’t get it if I apply for an open postdoc position. So I asked a few professors of my field about postdoc positions in their labs or group via email and got negative response. I am assuming this is because they think I am not going to add any value in their group because I don’t have any publication. Am in correct in my assumption or any of you got postdoc with the similar situation as I’m in right now?\n\n(b) Should I still keep trying, provide I am unemployed and dot have saving for more than two months at the moment? \n\n(c) Is it worthwhile to switch to industry instead? If yes, then I don’t have any experience as a statistician/ quantitative analyst/ data analyst or data scientist, so I am being hopeless to get a job in industry too. Am I being too pessimistic even with a doctoral degree on my dream project from a worldly reputed university? \n\n(d) I am losing focus,  despite having an excellent academic record and a fair university teaching experience relative to my career stage. What should I do now?",

For context, I’m in an undergrad program and this class pretty much focuses on thinking about different philosophical theories in the context of current world issues, the future, or change. \n\nNear the end of my discussion, my prof started talked about international conflicts, his own personal ethnic identity, and some other controversial opinions of his. After all that, he brought up the recent news about the earthquake in Turkey and Syria (he’s neither). For some reason, even though I never share ANYTHING super personal in class, I shared that I had friends who’s families were impacted in the earthquake and pretty much my intention was to relate it to the topic of international global catastrophes and the theory. \n\nAnyways the way I attempted to even explain my point was embarrassing and completely incoherent, to the point where my prof misunderstood me and replied with “so you think we should all know about every single catastrophe or disaster that’s ever happened around the world at all times…?” But my point was that many of these international events seem like a distant or dystopian concept to us if we aren’t directly impacted (which related to a quote in the text). Regardless if my point was dumb to begin with, I said it in an even dumber way to the point where my prof looked visibly annoyed and I sounded like I was trying to be ultra woke even though it was just my adhd and anxiety brain completely malfunctioning. I really respect this prof and enjoy his class, but now I’m just cringing at myself and the thought of going back. Not only that but a few hours after class, he reposted something on one of his social media platforms (which he puts on the syllabus because it’s public/he’s fine with students following him) something along the lines of “yeah because posting about something will stop all of the bad things happening in the world right now” which I feel like was indirectly @ me. \n\nI feel so much shame because I shared something personal and because I executed a poorly put together point from it plus now having to deal with the fear of being entirely misunderstood by my prof and classmates. Is there any way to recover from this? Should I be extremely embarrassed about this or am I overreacting? I feel like my profs perception of me is completely tarnished. I’m super sad.",

For instance, a publication limit across the board wouldn't make sense since some fields need to publish more than others. I'm in a humanities/social sciences field and I've read that, in the hard sciences, publishing a lot is normal and not necessarily bad for the quality of the papers. These policies should therefore be implemented according to the field.\n\nThen there's the more technical aspects of it. How much would be too much? If the number of papers is no longer a good measure, how would would a future employer assess that a prospective scholar has written a *good* paper? \n\nI'm probably not the first to have thought about this.

Idk if he's judging me because I work remotely quite a lot? Or I don't crave being around people? That's all I can think of.\n\nIn any case, it doesn't matter to me, but it makes being in the office awkward now, especially as we sit next to each other. It makes me not want to be there and it's affecting my decisions to do informal gatherings as well- I just don't want to be around someone like that, especially as he's a central figure in the cohort having had relevant previous experience.\n\nE.g. there's an informal gathering coming up that he's going to, and it makes me not want to go. If the reason he's being a jerk to me is because I'm often remote, then it will make him be even more of a dick if I don't go to these kinds of gatherings. Fucked up, right?\n\nAdvice on how I should handle this? I like the other people in my program fine enough, so it sucks that this guy's toxic attitude is targeted at me now.",

I am a first year PhD student, and there is this dynamic in the lab where the other senior PhD student I am working with will only show data that agrees with the expected result. If I am to test his samples, he will give me multiple samples and tell me to test them all in case some of them are bad. And when I show this 'bad' data to my advisor, they will blame me for being careless during my analysis, and that I should learn more from the senior student, who knows of this variance but never mentions it to the PI.\n\nIs this a healthy dynamic? What can I do?",

I have a job in a museum already in a research library, but I am thinking of spending another year here, graduating, then searching for another museum job elsewhere (they are sparse atm).\n\nFor several years I wanted to teach, high school specifically. I was beginning to fall out of love with that idea and I watched many of my friends go on to student teach then quickly move into a different field. My goal is to continue working in museums but I have often considered trying to make it in academia (I love research, reading, teaching, and writing). Realistically, I would love to have the option of teaching at a community college. Now, I have an undergrad in history but no graduate level courses. I am seeing that most community colleges and university lecture pools want the applicant to have 18 credit hours of graduate level history, which is equivalent to most graduate certificates.\n\nWould this be a smarter option than spending the next 4-7 years of my life working towards a PhD that will not guarantee me a job in academia? Outside of the museum field, I have also loved the idea of being a professor (I love reading, researching, and writing), but the job prospects do not seem to outweigh the potential risk (time, money, mental health) of getting a PhD.\n\nAny advice or guidance is appreciated!

I love my job, but I'm also curious about academic research and if I'd enjoy it. I feel like the solution to either of these options is to pursue a master's program that will allow me to research - if I like it, perhaps I can pursue a PhD, or if I don't, at least I can continue to work and teach part-time as a lecturer. The problem is that most Master's of Accounting programs in the US focus very heavily on preparing students for the CPA exams (which I've passed) or getting a job in the industry (which I've also done). Committing to a PhD when I've not conducted any formal research already doesn't feel like the right move for me, and I also worry about having to take the GMAT/GRE. \n\nHas anyone heard of these programs existing? I'm also wondering if it's appropriate to reach out to schools that have \"regular\" master's programs to ask if any of their faculty do research and if there's some type of alternative track I can take in the program that isn't normally offered.\n\nThanks!",

However, when they went through my background, they could not find any publication attesting to those skills.\n\n\nMy PhD supervisor has been sitting on the manuscript for the last three years and refuses to give a green light with the submission or even tell me if the manuscript needs any change.

So, it is not unheard of. (I found 3 threads on Reddit about failed master thesis and all of them were from Germany)\n\nI've heard people say that if the supervisor thinks you will fail the thesis, he will not let you defend / he will let you know so that you can correct the mistakes. However, my supervisor is super unavailable. My second supervisor is also not available. They take weeks to reply to an email. And sometimes they never reply. It's insanely difficult to set up a meeting with them. Therefore, i do not think they will spend enough time on reading my drafts to tell me that i am not ready. Therefore, there is a higher probability of me blindly submitting my thesis, and failing it.\n\n I already signed a paper that makes me submit the thesis in 4 weeks or i would fail. So i do not have the time to do focus groups or interviews again (it's also hard to convince participants to do the interview again).\n\nJust to clarify: i haven't yet realised that my methodology was incorrect. Due to time practicalities, i started doing interviews before i read about how to do them in the right way. only now i started reading papers on the best way to conduct qualitative research. As i read more and more, i am more fearful that i will read something that will make me realize that i made a huge mistake in my interviews and i will have no options to correct it.\n\n\nI have yet to do the coding and the analysis, and i can easily re-do these because it's completely in my control. Conducting another set of interviews? Not possible at all in the time given.",

Any clarification provided would be appreciated. There are six sections, and at the end of some statements, there are [1,2,3,4] written in brackets (like I just showed here). Initially, I had thought that those were citations, but now I am getting even more confused because there is no reference list or bibliography at the end of the attachment. I am able to look for grammatical errors, punctuations, even citation errors, and such; however, I really am unable to wrap my head around what I am even supposed to do with those numbers bracketed at the end of some statements.

What are your thoughts and opinions?   \n\n\n I am currently halfway through but have compiled a list of reasons why I am considering leaving:\n\n1. I no longer desire a career in academia due to a better understanding of its toxicity, even though I enjoyed working as a research assistant before.\n\n2. The connections I am making are not relevant to the field I want to work in.\n\n3. I have been struggling to complete any academic work for the past year.\n\n4. I question the significance of my university's ranking.\n\n5. The idea of leaving to pursue a job that values my time and effort brings me happiness.\n\n6. My supervisors' recent progress report states that I have only made 25% progress despite being halfway through the program.\n\n7. I have yet to collect data for my first study, and my supervisor has added another study to my workload.\n\n8. All of my studies require primary data, which has been challenging to collect (difficult sample to collect from and I cannot hire companies to collect it for me as they do not have the panel for it). Despite my concerns, my supervisor has instructed me to figure it out on my own.\n\n9. I am skilled at analysis but am stuck collecting data for two years, and the next data collection steps will be ten times harder.\n\n10. My supervisor does not support networking and seems more focused on using me as a research machine.\n\n11. I am unable to switch supervisors due to my circumstances, so I would have to quit entirely and start over.  \n\n\n12. As you can see, I have become an extremely negative-minded person and it is spilling over in other aspects of my life. Some days I just really struggle with my mental health and it affects my loved ones. \n\nThe potential downsides of leaving include disappointing my parents and the professor who recommended me for this position, as well as missing out on potential career promotions and opportunities that a PhD can offer.",

I am ********, an undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student at ******************, India.  This email is related to your current interest in the syntactic analysis of short format user-generated text, which usually does not adhere to the traditional syntax of the language.\n\nI read your recent paper in which you describe the limitations of black box interpreters (such as LIME and SHAP) that use word-based sampling and propose that sentence-based sampling generally yields superior results. Given that word-based sampling frequently renders text unreadable and destroys subject-verb interactions, I found sentence-based sampling to be highly logical and intuitive. In addition, one of the paper's suggestions was that sentence-based sampling for interpreting NLP models dealing with short-format text (such as tweets, reviews, etc.) may not produce accurate results. This was not examined in great depth. Therefore, I would like to work on this with you.\n\nAmong my practical experiences is a stint at the CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL). NCL is India's largest public laboratory for chemistry research. To be more precise, I am utilizing RNNs and LSTMs to comprehend the grammar of molecules when they are represented in a specific format known as \"SMILES.\" 2D molecular graphs are represented as 1D strings using \"SMILES\" format. Then, I generate novel psychoactive drugs using pre-existing psychoactive drugs as a starting point. Before using RNNs and LSTMs, I attempted the generation of novel psychoactive drugs with GANs and Variational AutoEncoders, but these approaches proved to be ineffective.\n\nI am confident that I can successfully apply my prior knowledge while working under your direction. In addition, I have maintained a strong academic record with a 9.43 out of 10 GPA. I have also successfully presented a research paper that will soon be published at an IEEE conference.\n\nTherefore, I am contacting you for any potential opportunities to work under your supervision between May '22 and August '22. Please find my attached resume. I would be happy to provide any further information or material at your request.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.",

Now, since papers come from multiple sources, there are also some duplicates (two search systems returning the same paper). In the case of a duplicate, the entry should state all the paper's sources (and maybe the line gets marked as duplicate somehow).\n\nEventually, I would like to have a consolidated, duplicate-free list of all papers from all the result sets. How do you approach a task like this? Do you have any recommendations? Are there maybe any tools that could automate (part of) the process?\n\nThanks in advance for your help! :)",

The two schools I am interested in attending are both in the same state, as my spouse wants to live there. I am attending grad school through a program offered by my employer so I will continue to receive my salary and my tuition is covered. Their only requirement is that I earn the MA.\n\nMy dilemma lies in the programs I was admitted for. My “top choice” school admitted me for an MA, and my second choice for a PhD. My concern is the ranking of the programs (I am basing this information solely on the rankings provided by US News, if this is a false assumption please let me know). The school that has admitted me for the MA is ranked 11th and the school offering me a PhD is 67th. Both of my potential advisers are awesome so no concerns there. The location of the MA school is a lot more desirable for us but we are not against moving to the PhD school. \n\nThis may be my only opportunity to attend grad school so I want to make the most of it, bottom line is I would love to get the PhD. If I go for the MA I may never have the opportunity to go back for the PhD due to life/family commitments. I know the job market for historians is bleak at best and the university ranking carries a lot of weight when applying for jobs. I will have some flexibility when looking for employment as I will have a pension from my current job (military). \n\nMy first thought is that the PhD will give me more options for employment in the future versus the MA. I am concerned that the ranking of the program will limit my opportunities and all my hard work work will be for nothing. \n\nI would greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice from the community.",

Many things happened along the last year, I’ve made a few mistakes (I believe like almost all phd students). He sent me emails pointing out my mistakes, which is a good thing so I’ll know that I was wrong, however the way he wrote some these emails were quite rude. Every time that I received his email I get anxious because I know this is going to affect me. Because of this I started to talk with a therapist and we are working on this. But now I don’t know what else to do, my friends and partner (which saw the emails and some of the online meetings) said that he is a toxic person and they suggested me to try to find a new supervisor. However my project now is already written and I wouldn’t like to change the methods, which I will have to change since he is the owner of all the equipments that I’m going to use.\n\nWhen I finally spoke with him about the situation (one of the hardest thing that ever did), telling how I fell after these emails (and crying as a child), he understood and said that he was going to change. In our next meeting after that I said that I appreciate the way he is sending me emails now (because if we didn’t had this conversation the response from the corrections of my paper that I send to him would be rude again) he said that he felt offended and I’m not a trustworthy person.\n\nNow I’m feeling that all of this was just something created by my mind and she never said anything rude or passive-aggressive.\n\nI really don’t know what to do, should I change my supervisor, continue with him and expect that the relationship is going to be better? The only thing that I can see now is quitting and never coming back to the academy, I’m sure that I don’t want this for my life. Anyone have any advice or has anyone been through a similar situation?",
