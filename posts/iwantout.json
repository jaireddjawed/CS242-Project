After years of dealing with racism, being victims of crimes, etc., we all kind of regret moving here. My parents are too established to consider moving back, and unfortunately we're not really in contact with the rest of our family. It could be that grass is greener on the other side, but I think I'd be happier living in a city somewhere in Asia due to better infrastructure, less crime, and a better cultural fit. My short-term goal is to find an internship or job by summer or fall of this year and live in another country for a year or two with the hopes of finding someplace I see myself living in for the rest of my life. Other than English I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and I speak conversational Thai and Japanese. \n\nMy main concern is actually finding said job or internship and getting a work visa. I graduated with a BA in psychology and should graduate with my MA this year. I've worked in a research lab but have little industry experience. A job in a research lab or as a user researcher would probably be ideal if available. I realize psychology might not be as desirable as something like business or medicine, but I'm hoping to do something related to my degree. I'd be willing to teach English for maybe a term or two, but I think I'd get burned out quickly. My personality is quite introverted.

However, my situation is a bit special, so I apologize that this post will take longer since I must clearly explain my situation. I appreciate your patience.\n\n## About myself\n\nI was a software engineer from China working in the United States on an H1B visa. I have used past tense since I got laid off several months ago. Despite my effort to find a new job, I haven't got one because of the current job market condition. Therefore, I enrolled in a college here and changed my status to a student. The sole purpose of attending college is to prevent myself from becoming an illegal immigrant since my H1B status has expired after two months of unemployment.\n\nDue to the gloomy prospect of finding a new visa-sponsoring job in the United States, I am considering applying for a university in Canada, getting the PGWP, and finally immigrating to Canada. Moreover, I have traveled to Canada several times and love the scenery, culture, and people. Canada also feels more secure for me, with better health care and less gun violence.\n\n## My plan\n\nI plan to apply for a Master's in Computer Science for Winter 2024, Spring 2024, or Fall 2024 intakes. Applying for a school is a piece of cake for me, but applying for a study permit seems more tricky. I come up with the following two plans:\n \n### Plan A: Apply for a Canadian student visa in the United States\n\nPros: Higher chance of getting my study permit approved since I am applying from the United States.\n\nCons: Unemployment and being a student of an unprestigious school seem to be red flags for the Canadian immigration agency.\n\n### Plan B: Apply for a Canadian student visa in my home country (China). \n\nPros: I can find a job in China (It's much easier than in the US since I don't require sponsorship), which improves the chance of study permit approval.\n\nCons: Applying from China lowers the student visa approval rate compared to applying in the US.\n\n## My question\n\nAll in all, what I am asking is: \n\nAs for the Canadian study permit approval rate, does the current physical presence in the US outweigh the disadvantage of unemployment?\n\nI appreciate it if you know any data or statistics. Also, feel free to refer an immigration consultant\/attorney\/law firm that might know about it.\n\n## Further details\n\nI'm sharing some more details that might help assess my situation.\n\n- Current liquid assets: I don't want to show the exact number, but it should be sufficient for a master's degree in Canada. I'm lucky I didn't buy a home when the interest was low.\n- Education: Bachelor in China, Master in the US, both in Computer Science\n- Work experience: 3 years\n\n## Why not?\n\n### Why not try Canada EE (FSW)?\n\nI scored myself, concluding I could only get invited with Canadian work experience. \n\n### Why not look for a job in Canada?\n\nIt's impossible due to the current job market. LMIA is also tricky.","upvote_ratio":0.42,"created_utc":1678673129.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 27M Civil Servant\/Project Manager UK -> USA","author":"Strathness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11phx7w\/iwantout_27m_civil_servantproject_manager_uk_usa\/","text":"Q1 - Would it be easier or quicker to immigrate to the USA with a second bachelors degree in Computer Science (combined with additional necessary work experience) vs. my current Economics degrees and government work experience alone?\n\nQ2 - Are there any popular USA visa options for government employees with senior management experience that I could apply for that I'm just overlooking?

I have an undergraduate and masters degree in economics from a good UK university (2.1; Merit). For the past 4 years I have worked in the civil service as a policy professional and project manager in multiple health-related roles, now in a fairly senior management role (G7). I want to make a career change to software engineering, data science, or a related computing field. Both because I enjoy coding and maths-based problem solving, but also because I want to immigrate to the USA and it is one of the most sought after professions for USA companies employing foreigners.\n\nRight now, I am sat on an unconditional offer to a Scottish university for a second undergraduate degree in Computer Science which will take four years to complete if I graduate on time. Doing a degree to move to another country on its own is a big commitment and probably fairly dumb, but might make sense vs. a bootcamp as USA visa conditions tend to specify a related undergraduate degree as necessary evidence. It could also help with getting a job and necessary work experience afterwards. I code and do math in my spare time and would likely enjoy the degree regardless. Added benefit of the university route might be the opportunity for a study abroad semester on a J-1 visa to see the USA a bit more.\n\nI am aware the most common routes to the USA are the H1-B, EB-2\/3, L-1 & J-1 - each of which are employment\/study based, which doesn't typically include government policy professionals.\n\nThank you!","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678636646.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 19M College Student USA -> Mexico","author":"Cpantonio","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11pnead\/iwantout_19m_college_student_usa_mexico\/","text":"\nHello, first post here.

If it helps, I'm also willing to go back to driving delivery trucks or simple office management, though I suppose nobody needs a foreigner to do that.\n2. I don't speak any non-English European languages, but aside from getting started in a new country, that would be my top priority. I believe it's rude not to learn the language of a country one lives in. I could go to school part-time after a full-time job, or work part-time and do school full or part time, or whatever. I don't think I need another professional degree, but depending on the type of visas available, I'd be willing to do that, or just go to school full-time for language. Note: I would currently be in school to learn a language, but the area I'm at doesn't have any nearby schools that offer anything other than Spanish, Chinese, or Latin.\n3. I'm pretty flexible and would be open to a work visa or any type of student\/language visa, see above. I prefer to work and make money while going to school if that's an option, but if it's not an option, I'll just have to save up a bit more to be comfortable.\n4. No family of my own, no criminal record, good credit, nothing holding me back here.\n5. I've done a lot of volunteer work here, and I'm willing to do it elsewhere whether it helps or not, though I suppose most volunteer positions in the US are probably paid positions in most other places.\n\nSome of the things that matter to me would be:\n\n1. Important - being in a city with great medical care. I do have to see a cardiologist and a hematologist every so often (and I'm willing to pay for whatever insurance would be best for my situation). I assume this will also mean probably living in a medium to large city, which is fine.  I know the medical care in Europe is generally better because almost everyone has access to it, but I don't know much about the quality of care itself.  For instance, it varies greatly by city or state in the US.\n2. Medium importance - access to a therapist. I understand that trying to find one anywhere is tough these days, especially an English-speaking one until I learn the language.\n3. Important - I'd need to be able to rent a decent apartment, preferably one that allowed a well-behaved dog.  I understand that a lot of countries\/bigger cities are low on housing.\n\nThings that would be really nice bonuses but aren't absolutely required:\n\n1. A place with friendly locals would be nice. But having spent a few months in France, I fully understand that it's difficult to meet new people. Probably especially when it comes to dating, but that's ok.\n2. A place with air conditioning would be very nice, even if I had to just buy and install a basic window unit, as long as I was allowed to do that. I'm not a fan of constant temperatures above 25\u00b0C or so.\n3. I'd say that low crime rates are ideal, but I think that most places are going to be a lot safer than some of the US cities I've lived in. Still, not having to worry about being robbed is nice.\n4. I'm used to making a high salary, but as long as I have work that pays the bills and allows me to travel a bit and save a bit, I would be happy. I know the cost of living varies greatly by country and city\/town.\n5. Good public transportation. I know that unlike the US, most cities will already have this. But if not, I'd be willing to buy a car.\n\nRandom things about me that may or may not help:\n\nI'm generally a mellow guy. I like walking, going the gym, movies, video games, playing pool, darts, karaoke, historical stuff, being near water or lots of trees - but I can do without most of that if needed.\n\nI'm also going to play it safe and visit the top 2 or 3 recommended countries before filling out applications for jobs or school, so your suggestions are appreciated! Note: I have spent time in France (no offense to anyone, but I probably wouldn't move there) and the Netherlands (I had a great time and the people in The Hague were a lot friendlier than I expected! But I've been told by Dutch people that their health care is not the best?). I feel I should visit Germany and at least some of the Scandinavian countries.\n\nThanks again for any suggestions, and feel free to ask any questions that might help!","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678513606.0},{"title":"[Iwantout] 25M Turkey English Teacher -> Romania","author":"Slivereen1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11nl2m5\/iwantout_25m_turkey_english_teacher_romania\/","text":"Hey.

Got interested in teaching English, got a cert (a high quality one, won't specify the name, but it's not one of those 100 dollar online certs but a prestigious one!) for that, and now have my own online business with about 5 years of experience. At the same time, I've been learning a bunch of languages at uni. At the moment I'm at a B1 in German, A2 in Italian, and A1 in French and Russian (took exams and stuff too). I'm always at the top of my class and I plan to continue all of these in the upcoming academic year.\n\nWhat do I want to do?: I'm wondering if I can study (or work? Is that a possibility at all?) in Europe, although I am not really sure what I'd want to study... I'd definitely prefer something that would eventually allow me to get a job - mainly to allow me to stay there - I make decent money with my career and would like to continue it actually. I suppose I could go the digital nomad route but afaik those programs usually don't count towards permanent residency. Correct me if I'm wrong, please.\n\nProblem is, my GPA is too low. On a 4 point scale it's something like 2.3...I actually switched my major at the last possible minute lol...But that's not good enough for grad programs iirc. Is there any hope at all for a stupid person? I don't really have a location preference and I'm good at learning languages.\n\nI have almost 9.5k euro saved up at the moment. I can get to a C1 in German in ~18mos if I really apply myself (although I'll be technically starting a B2 program in July). In the same time frame I could get up to a B2 in Italian as well. I'm not averse to learning another language if need be! If I need to take the IELTS, I can get a pretty high score too (8-9). I love learning languages tbh it's probably one of my biggest passions and I'd prefer to study something in the local language :D I'm not in a hurry though, because I'm undergoing medical treatment here that'll take at least 15-18 months (nothing serious).\n\nWhy do I want to move out?: There's issues at home I can no longer deal with. I already moved out of my parents' home once and they begged me to come back. I did, but they did not change, and I still deal with insults and physical assault. But renting in my city is not really worth it b\/c of a range of factors and buying a (not-so-good) apartment would be somewhat possible, but imo not really worth it since it would tie up my finances. You might wonder, why not move to another part of the country? Thing is, I already live in the best city in the country. Anything else would be a serious downgrade.\n\nPlease don't recommend another place in Asia\/North America\/South America, they wouldn't be a good fit for me.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1678506139.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 24M Algeria -> United States","author":"depay29","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11nqi48\/iwantout_24m_algeria_united_states\/","text":"Hey,\n\nso my partner that i spent the most of my life with, has been selected in the DV Lottery and she finally settled in Florida and got her Permanent Resident card and she is not so far from getting a job.\n\nAs we planned before she went, that when she finishes with the paper works and stuff related to her travel, we marry and we gather there in Florida, my question is it possible for us (for me) to get the chance to go to the US when she has only the resident card, in Algeria we don't have any paper proving that we are married.\n\nwhen she comes back to Algeria and we do all the marriage, will i have to right to go with her ?\n\nand please i need maximum tips for us to do in this case.\n\nThank you","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678458074.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 25M Pakistan -> West","author":"saadjhk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11nx382\/iwantout_25m_pakistan_west\/","text":"Hi, i am a Software engineer from Pakistan and i want to leave it due to economic instability and lack of good jobs as compared to the west.

I\u2019m Costa Rican, recently got bachelor\u2019s degree in photography, I am fluent in both written and spoken English and Spanish and know a little bit of French. Currently I\u2019m taking ceramic, design thinking and 2D animation \/ Illustration classes. In short, I would like to start new, find peace and have better economic stability. I\u2019m curious and passionate about nature, arts, design and teaching.\n\nI mainly work as freelance portrait, event and product photographer (since around 2016), graphic designer for social media posts, mailing and printing (also since 2016), handpoke tattoo artist (2018, but no constant income here) and teaching photography and design on some private universities and cultural organizations here in CR (2019). \n\nI love working with art, teaching and design, if I had to organize them by how much I enjoy them I would put tattooing first, then teaching, then photography, and then design, but can try working in other areas. Interestingly some friends that recently traveled told me that I should move out to places like Berlin or London, I have also tattooed clients from London and I feel that there\u2019s better reception for my tattoo work there. I also like working with animals, nature, children and adults so I\u2019m open to many things.\n\nAbout the anywhere part, I would like a place that doesn\u2019t get too warm, I am used to temperatures around 27 to 18 Celsius but can stand lower temps. I prefer mostly suburban and rural areas but can be open to urban spaces. Also it would be cool if there\u2019s any program or scholarship for learning language, housing or something like that. \n\nI would also like affordable housing, don\u2019t need  a large space, one bedroom and a place to work and eat are more than enough, also don\u2019t really care for access to theaters, shopping malls, fancy restaurants or stores, so there\u2019s no problem not having any nearby. Good public transportation would be great, I have drivers license but would like to avoid buying or renting a car unless it\u2019s totally necessary. \n\nFor example, since childhood I\u2019ve watched documentaries about Japan, my graduation project had to do with mono no aware, and I\u2019m thinking of learning the language (Japanese or any language from any place) I like suburban areas and the countryside because of how clean and tidy they are, but also the community sense. Also I\u2019ve learnt a lot about Japanese philosophy and arts. \n\nMy only responsibility now is my cat and if possible it would be great keeping him with me. I seek a fresh start, getting to know new places and learn from new cultures, but also find a place that gives me peace and where I can grow and would prefer somewhere with better paying jobs than here because a quick search for designer\/communication jobs offer around $820 per month working 48 (sometimes more) hours per week and with that income it\u2019s difficult to afford housing, transportation and living on your own, this kind of jobs are undervalued here. Lastly, some months ago ended my 4 year relationship with ex-gf so there\u2019s no emotional attachment and I am not in need to be with someone or have a hyperactive social life. \n\nDo you think there\u2019s somewhere I can go with my experience and knowledge? Or some place where I can have a not too rough start in other area since I don\u2019t earn too much money.

While I was born in the USA, my father immigrated to the USA from Argentina in his 20s, and I have a few family members still in Argentina. He's been heavily encouraging me to visit there, and it seems like the idea destination for me. \n\nMy situation: I work for a USA company, and have lived in DC, Calgary, and Sacramento. I earn a strong salary (85k USD), and I'm currently interviewing for positions to bump that to 95-105k. However, I don't particularly enjoy living in the USA\/Can. I find it difficult to get around, expensive, and hard to meet people. Part of this is because I've mostly lived either deep in the suburbs, in 2nd tier cities, or both, and while I've considered trying to move to a more interesting city such as Chicago, NYC, or LA, Chicago's weather + crime terrifies me, NYC is insanely expensive, and LA has too much sprawl. \n\nSeparately, I've always wanted to be able to genuinely identify with my hispanic heritage, as opposed to it being a line on a form. I want to be able to speak spanish, read and write in spanish, meet other hispanics and feel a sense of cultural connection, rather than an imposter. \n\nThese are the reasons I'm thinking of argentina specifically\n\n- Easy immigration, especially with USD - My understanding is that its not that difficult to enter the country, and the 1 day loophole means that you can just renew the visa indefinitely\n- Low COL, but high standard of living - Given my USD salary, I would be able to afford a reasonably high end apartment, and searching on websites such as bytargentina gives me a wide range of nice, furnished, short term apartments in the 1000-1500 usd range, in nice parts of the city. \n- Relatively safe, at least in the nice parts of town - When I was in Palermo in 2017, I felt quite safe, along with downtown. I've heard that it gets quite scary very quickly the further south you go, but my understanding is with a bit of wits you can stay reasonably safe. \n- Social population - The big thing I've read here when it comes to regrets is people moving to europe or other parts of the world where people are very closed off or antisocial compared to latin america. I'm hoping that in Argentina people will be reasonbly outgoing and open to meeting newcomers. \n- Easy to get around - I was always very impressed by the subte and BRT, and the idea of being able to live somewhere where I can walk 2 blocks to a bakery, or a grocery store, or a deli is extremely appealing to me\n- (relatively) high english proficiency - I'm hoping that I will be able to make friends with people who I can communicate with in my native language. Even though my goal is to become reasonably adept at spanish, it'll take a long time for me to communicate fully, and I'm hoping to live somewhere where I can have more complex conversations while I get up to speed\n- Good time zones - Even though Argentina is +2 to EST, my understanding is that its a city of night owls and that getting off work at 7pm is far from a death sentence. If anything, the late mornings would help with how often people tend to stay up late\n- I have family in the country that can help with emergencies - My relatives are, thankfully, fairly well off and work as doctors or other well off professions. With their connections, should something happen, I should be able to get help navigating the system, finding medical care, resolve financial \/ legal emergencies, etc. \n\nMy concerns are: \n\n- Having a hard time meeting people without drinking - I enjoy staying up late, but unfortunately Alcohol doesn't play well with me, and so I tend to be quite sober. I'm concerned it'll be hard to make friends if I don't drink, and I'm not very good at dancing either. I'm worried that it'll be hard for me to appreciate the nightlife for those reasons\n- Sticking out \/ having people try to take advantage of me - Earning 7-8x the average salary in a country, combined with my poor spanish and english accent makes me worry that I'll constantly be targeted, especially when I try to date. Luckily for me, I'm a 6' tall young white guy who does have ethnic ties to the country, so I'm not an immediate target when walking down the street or whatnot, but I worry in social situations that things will be complex, especially during nightlife. \n- Not being able to meet educated people - Given the situation in Argentina, pretty much everybody there seems to be looking for their way out. Almost every one of my family members in Argentina has made the jump to the USA, and the only ones who remain remain for the reasons that they have connections, or that they're too old to move. I'm worried it'll be hard to meet educated people in Argentina, especially given the previous issue, and that they'd more be some level of resentful \/ jealous of me. \n\nSo - that's my thinking. My aim is to spend the next 6 months trying to drill spanish so that I can converse at a very rudimentary level once I'm in Argentina. If things go well, my goal is to extend my stay relatively indefinitely. If not, my plan is to come back home. \n\nHas anybody else here made the jump? How'd it go for you? Do you have any advice? \n\nThanks","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678429161.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 36M artist\/boatbuilder Switzerland -> Brazil\/Colombia\/CostaRica","author":"niamhedit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11mw2hd\/iwantout_36m_artistboatbuilder_switzerland\/","text":"Hello there, I am a swiss citizen and potential green card holder (havent fully completed the process as of yet) I have been stuck in a miserous situation, after settling back in my hometown in switzerland.\n\nI could potentially go back to the US and settle in, but id rather emigrate to a latin country.

I just don\u2019t know how realistic it is (getting an EP sponsor, PR chances, etc) for Singapore, since I\u2019ve read online that the immigration pipeline has tightened significantly.  I understand that the clock is ticking, since PR chances drop after 30. On the other hand, I am also aware that the Singaporean government has an unspoken mandate to maintain the Chinese % of the population, so I might be seen more favorably in that light? I\u2019m not certain how much the tightened immigration requirements and Chinese ethnicity balance one another out. \n\nRaising a family in the Bay Area is doable for me, but not ideal, I don\u2019t think I can afford to live in the neighborhoods with top-rated schools, and worse schools in my experience are physically dangerous. Besides that, there\u2019s the latent Bay Area annoyances of petty theft, break-ins, power outages, bad food, traffic, etc. These are all non-issues in Singapore (in my experience). \n\nOn a more philosophical level, I don\u2019t want my son to experience racism the same way that I did, since it seems like there is a way that sidesteps it entirely (moving to Singapore). I think for my parents generation, it was a reasonable trade off (they could afford to live in safety, buy a home, and raise their children free of Communist tyranny, in exchange for some racist treatment) but a lot of that social contract has broken down for my generation (not to sound too fairweather about Canada\/the US, but it is true). \n\nMy plan at the moment is to move to Singapore this year, and try to get PR within the next 4-5 years (so my kid can go to local schools, since I hear that EP holders must send their children to international school). I\u2019m of the opinion that he will be better integrated into Singaporean society attending local schools. I don\u2019t mind that he will have to serve NS in due time. \n\nI\u2019m ok with brutal work hours, I am a bit of a workaholic and doing 80-hour weeks keeps me from focusing on depressing thoughts so I think(?) that \u201cAsian\u201d working conditions wouldn\u2019t bother me so much.  Maybe it would feel different if the crunch were imposed from up top rather than self-imposed though, if that makes sense? On a more practical level, I know that I would be taking a significant pay cut (from 220K USD to maybe 80K SGD, as far as I can tell is the prevailing wage for SWE in Singapore at my level). \n\nIs my plan realistic?

This Program does involve job placement here in Canada at it's end but I would like to eventually find work in Germany in regards to journalism, media, or other such fields (I am also a YouTuber at present focusing on Science Fiction literature namely Warhammer 40K I go by Live! From The Black Library on YouTube. I hope this will look good on a resume when I find work by demonstrating skill in script writing, podcasting, interviews, narrating, and video production) At present I am learning German as best as I can to this end but it has been slow thus far as I am doing so in secret from my family. I would like to be living and working in Germany before the age of 30 if that is possible\n\nDoes anyone know of specific requirement for finding work in Germany as a Canadian in regards to these fields? I understand there is competition and that nothing is guaranteed by I still have hope.\n\nWhy Germany? (Personal Aspect):\n\nI should clarify that the desire to move to Germany goes way back for me. My family has always been very restrictive and unpleasant which lead me to become an outsider\/recluse but back around 8 or 9 years ago I ended up getting drunk with friends for the first time (they FORBID alcohol) and woke up in the back of my parents car. At the point they forbid me from ever speaking to my friends and told me I was never allowed any friends again. This lead me inter a deep depression and severely damaged my mental health. This period of time lasted for 10.5 months until I got them to relent by telling them about my diminished mental health. Life at home is still awful hence why my youtube channels are a secret and I never leave the house because even though they say I CAN I'm just not comfortable and extremely traumatized due to their judgemental and emotionally abusive nature as well as my own bitterness at the childhood and youth I was robbed of.\n\nWhat got me through that period of time and has gotten me through other low periods since was essentially an Oath of Moment where I promised myself I'd get out and move to Europe. I ended up fixating on Germany for a number of reasons (one being my family life is full of noise and disturbance which I as an autistic individual hate as well as an appreciation for Germany + the german national character feels much more to my liking) and Cologne in particular because it has a mime school and is a big city in a good location despite it's higher costs. Mime and performance in general is a big ambition of mine to pursue alongside a proper career. I'm so insistent on that because I feel like I need to do this to stand up for myself and finally keep a promise to myself to take control of my own life and live on my terms. Since I'm doing my journalism degree I'd prefer to find work with a German English language news outlet like TheLocal or DW or Euronews but if ALL ELSE fails I might have to relent and do a nursing Ausbildung which is not ideal for me due to the long hours, and low pay.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678131391.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 18F UAE -> UK\/germany","author":"IncomePuzzleheaded13","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11kmikn\/iwantout_18f_uae_ukgermany\/","text":"please help me come to a conclusion because im extremely indecisive. im a non eu national and cant seem to decide between the UK or germany for my immigration journey. this question is is specifically directed towards those who had experience with the immigration process in either countries, im really inclined to hear your stories and i want to know how long or painful the whole process was.  \n\nim mainly looking at which has more lax immigration laws and policies for those who are planning to study comp sci and ai and want to work in the tech industry as a non eu national, \nwhich is less of a pain in the ass to immigrate to and settle down in? i eventually want to gain citizenship as well and this is a huge factor since im planning on leaving the country permanently. \n\n\nive made a list of countries ive considered as well and cleared out the ones that have  strict immigration policies ( austria for example, nice country but it takes like 10 years to get citizenship in as well) or ones with extremely cold weather and a weird language (finland)  \nive applied to universities in both countries and im waiting for a decision, please help. \n\n\n\n\n(ive actually planned to move to the netherlands a while ago and im at b1 level dutch but then i eventually changed my mind, then considered belgium as well since you become a citizen after 5 years of perm residency but im still unsure, whats your opinion?)\n\n\ntdlr: i want to choose which has lax immigration laws where i can eventually settle down in and gain citizenship. i dont rly mind learning a new language if my degree is in english while at uni so i wont waste time but it would be easier to settle down in a country where you speak the language of on a more fluent level. i also want to eventually change my name in the country im moving to as i heard unpleasant things about germanys name change policies which is kinda offputting to me \n\n\n\n\npros of each country \nuk pros: \nenglish speaking \nlax name change policies\n 2 year post study work visa\n\ngermany pros: \naccess to eu\ncheaper","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678156420.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 19M USA-> European Union","author":"conormdias","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11jjriy\/iwantout_19m_usa_european_union\/","text":"I currently work full time in small town USA, I have a budget of 5-10k to move possibly with some financial support.

It was a fantasy of ours when we were younger, but always in the romantic sense of \"can you imagine what it would be like if ...\". That was ten years ago and while we still fantasize about how great it might be, we also feel dread with what we'd leave behind. We love our families and have friends who might as well be.\n\nFast forward to present day and we're 3 months away from welcoming our firstborn. While we're certainly not going anywhere anytime soon, it would be a lie to say we haven't given it more thought. We know in our heart of hearts that we don't want to raise our child under the US Govt. While we have many issues with the UK, it's a far cry from the issues that plague the US. We've been lucky in our careers that we can consider purchasing a second home, albeit not in central London, but at least near enough that I could commute in. More on that at the end.\n\nI have made a career in tech and specifically in start-ups. While there is upside to the money, I would like to find something more stable as I enter fatherhood. I'm hoping to bring my experience to a larger company who can sponsor me, which will be its own challenge. It also seems that salaries are significant less in the UK than in the states. I'm not sure why that is? Salary for a VP of Engineering in the states is around 200-250k but 100-150k in the UK. Even when considering the pound to dollar it's significantly less. Fortunately, we don't have any debt and are in good credit standing.\n\n~~I think the ideal situation would be to work remote for 6 months (182 days) out of the year, within the US, and spend 6 months (183 days) in England. I don't have a job lined up, but if I did, I would assume it would be near London. Not to say there aren't tech companies outside of London but I would imagine the odds are in London's favor. I believe the 183 days counts as having lived in the UK for that year. If all goes well, apply for citizenship in 5 years - a requirement I believe? What I don't know is how the US would treat me living 6 months abroad. I know I would still have to pay and file taxes but would there be any other consequences for spending the majority of the year abroad? Additionally, is my wife, who in all likelihood will not be working and\/or not have a visa, be able to stay for 183 days or would she need to return with my son sooner?

I would interview the department's undergrads, master's students, PhD students, and professors about things which should be tackled. I would then present them at frequent interdepartmental meetings and negotiate the implementation of solutions for these issues.\n* Participated in the 2019 Birmingham Project challenge, my team researched and presented findings about the University of Birmingham's campus recycling shortcomings and what they could do to improve. Local climate\/sustainability advocacy groups at my uni used this to successfully encourage the university to improve its recycling scheme and food service sustainability.\n* Participated in an LGBTQ+ Mentoring Scheme at my university where I spent time with a      geoengineer graduate who advised me on career paths and future advocacy for LGBTQ+ folk in the workplace which I later implemented during an external year full-time job at NatWest.\n* Completed an Advanced Personal Skills Award - it's basically an employability skills scheme that teaches students how to deal with assessment centres, STAR interview methods etc.\n* I spent an external year away from my studies during covid working for NatWest's business banking department, I dealt with business banking customers and did climate change presentations on the side for my manager. I was also very active with their LGBTQ+ diversity scheme where I helped highlight issues that my demographic was facing within the company, as well as curating learning resources for NatWest in my spare time.\n* I've done a variety of seasonal part-time jobs including English\/geography\/geology tutoring, retail, bartending, waitressing, axe throwing instructing, and rock climbing instructing.I have even started my own local pet care business to supplement my income throughout my undergrad, I also offer advice to pet owners on sustainability and offer them free homemade bird of prey nesting boxes for their gardens - I love woodworking and use scrap wood from local businesses to make them.\n* I founded and ran a sex ed society at my university throughout my undergrad where I collaborated and obtained sponsorships from local  charities around the local area, our main goal was to bridge the gap in high school sex ed that doesn't cover LGBTQ+ issues and safety.

Previously we\u2019ve lived in Boise, Phoenix, and Tucson, and are originally from Missouri. \n\nWe originally moved to Colorado Springs because we wanted the outdoor amenities with a climate cooler than Phoenix and Tucson, and feels a bit more worth the high housing costs than Boise. \n\nUnfortunately I think we put a bit too much focus on outdoor amenities, probably didn\u2019t do enough research about other aspects prior to moving, and ultimately ended up somewhere that\u2019s probably better to visit rather than live. \n\nSo we\u2019re on to something new! Currently we make around $200k combined, and would prefer our next place be more ideal for settling down and starting a family (kind of tired of moving lol)\n\nThings we\u2019re looking for are listed below\n\nDog friendly, but also responsible dog owners. People let their untrained dogs run off leash everywhere here and it\u2019s very frustrating for us and our pups. Nice dog parks, dog friendly trails, and less irresponsible owners would be a plus. \n\nOutdoor amenities and scenery. We hike (especially with our dogs), and I like climbing and mountain biking. It also never gets old to have good views, so interesting topography or geographic features are a plus.\n\nGreen space within the city would be great!\n\nClimate that would be friendly to us. That would be sub 100 degree temperatures for most of the year, low humidity or short summers if things are humid, and potential for snow\/neat weather events. \n\nGood hospital systems and good to nurses. No HCA hospitals. \n\nSome sort of culture or interesting identity. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s military centered, but Colorado Springs feels pretty bland. We would like a little more than Jesus, the Air Force, and hiking. \n\nOn top of the previous item, community pride would be cool.\n\nPopulation-wise we\u2019d prefer a city with under 600,000. Metro size under 1,200,000.

Can't change it sadly\n\nHey all,   \n\nI am an AI scientist\/engineer living in Canada. I recently acquired my Canadian permanent residency, and am an Indian citizen by birth. I plan to naturalize as a Canadian citizen in 2 years. I am aware that India doesn't allow dual citizenships, so I will be switching over to Permanent Residency (called Overseas Citizen of India) once I acquire Canadian citizenship. I am also considering gaining residency (and maybe PR or even citizenship) in a Latin American country. My reasons for doing so are:  \n1. To have a winter home that I can travel to for a few months.  \n2. Experience Latin American culture and food.   \n3. Save on living costs (and potentially retire outside) Canada.   \n\nI speak Spanish to a B-1\/2 level and can hold basic conversations with my neighbor and Spanish instructor, who are both from Mexico. I am also able to hold simple conversations with my co-workers from Venezuela and Colombia. I have a harder time understanding and communicating with Spanish speakers from Spain, plus it is an expensive country with high taxes, so I do not wish to live there.  I have been studying it for a few years and expect to be pretty proficient (C2 level) in the next 2-3 years. \n\nI am considering the option of getting a temporary residency in Mexico\/Ecuador because they do not have restrictive physical presence requirements and allow me to live most of the year in Canada (which I need to do before I naturalize), and work from Latin America remotely if I want to. The other reason is that both of them have a short-ish path to naturalization if I ever want to naturalize as a permanent resident or citizen in the future:   \n\n* Mexico grants temporary residency with no physical presence requirements if I have an after-tax income greater than $4,356 CAD (which I do), grants permanent residency after 4 years of being a temporary resident, and after 1 year of living there continuously as a PR grants citizenship.   \n* Ecuador grants temporary residency with no physical presence requirements if I make a deposit of around $42K in an Ecuadorean bank and hold it for a term of 4-5 years (which I am okay with), grants permanent residency after two years of temporary residency, and then citizenship after one year of PR and living at least half of the year there for the last three years.   \n\nWhat are the things that I should be considering or be aware of before I start the process to acquire temporary residency in one of these countries? Are there other Latin American countries that you can suggest I look into instead of Mexico\/Ecuador?

This post may be a touch long, but I\u2019ll try to be concise. \n\n**Current Situation and Background**\n\nOur family unit consists of myself (30M), my wife (30F), and our son (2M). I work as a tech consultant and my wife will soon ne finishing her Masters degree to become an elementary school teacher. Our degrees are both from accredited universities. I have approximately 5 years of professional work experience. \n\nWe\u2019ve been talking about leaving the US for a few years now, but recently an opportunity has come up which may allow us to do so. Our reasons behind wanting to move to Europe center around US gun crime (yes I know it\u2019s statistically rare, but even the .001% chance or whatever of my son being gunned down in elementary school is enough for me), the US healthcare system, and the general US way of life. Of course, we don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s some magical place where nothing bad ever happens fwiw. I\u2019ve also spent a considerable amount of time with my colleagues from our EMEA offices and they\u2019ve really convinced me it\u2019s worth looking into. My wife also previously lived in Italy and very much enjoyed it, but she was much younger. \n\n**The Opportunity**\n\nI may have the opportunity to move to Europe if I choose and keep the same job that I have with my current company. I believe I\u2019d take a decent pay cut, but I could expect to bring in roughly the equivalent of $100,000-$150,000 per year. My wife\u2019s income would be additional.\n\n**Where we\u2019re thinking and Some Questions**\n\nAfter l some consideration, we\u2019ve landed on 2 potential locations: Edinburgh, Scotland and Cork, Ireland. Of course, this is subject to change. After reading this post, if you have any other places you\u2019d suggest, we\u2019d love to hear them. We\u2019ve talked about Portugal as we\u2019ve read their education system is wonderful, but are unsure of learning an entirely new language. Not opposed, just unsure at first. We\u2019ve also considered the Netherlands, but have heard it\u2019s very expensive. \n\nOur reasoning behind these places comes from what we desire out of our location:\n\n\u2022Walkable, bike friendly\n\n\u2022Good primary and secondary education\n\n\u2022Affordable as we\u2019d eventually like to purchase a home \n\n\u2022Welcoming toward immigrants \n\n*Some questions:*\n\n\u2022My biggest point of confusion is about my wife\u2019s job potential. Can US certified teachers get teaching jobs in the EU and\/or the UK relatively easily? Is there a special process for this?\n\n\u2022Regarding EU vs UK: has Brexit had an effect in terms of immigration? Any downsides\/upsides or things to watch out for? \n\n\u2022We have a duplex that we own here in addition to our single family home. We plan to keep that as a retirement vessel as it nets us over $1k now. Has anyone done this? Pros\/Cons?\n\n\u2022Is the income amount I listed even reasonable to live there? I hear such conflicting things on COL and have a really difficult time knowing how expensive or inexpensive it is in various places there. \n\n\u2022Is there an amount of cash you\u2019d recommend having for this? Would $50-$100k be enough? \n\n\u2022How long would it take for us to be eligible for healthcare? We\u2019re both in great health, but would want to make sure we were covered in case anything happened. \n\nI can\u2019t think of anything else off the top of my head. I know some of this is online, I\u2019m just finding it hard to sift through the massive amount of info on the topic. I\u2019d love anecdotes, advice, anything.

R.O.C(Taiwan) is my only nationality.\n\nMy parents were divorced when I was \\~4 yo. Never heard anything from her again. Don't remember a thing about her.\n\nMy dad was a senior management in a medium size company in China(P.R.C) when he was at his peak(pre-2016), as a lone child I had to travel with him all the time, from places to places, staying for no more than 6 months.\n\nHe made about $39,500 USD annually, may not seems much but it's pretty impressive in Asian standard.\n\nMy dad misjudged the situation and made a decision to come back to Taiwan where I live(2016), he asked me what's my big plan for the future, I simply replied with uncertainty. Then after 2 years of going to highschool in Taiwan I realized I'm stranded in a foreign place where I don't belong to. Due to numerous reasons like culture, geo-politics, defeatism etc. I don't really call Taiwan(R.O.C) as my home.\n\nIn my final year in HS, I expressed my desire to leave\/immigrate to a different country, after my dad learned this he immediately regretted his decision of coming back to Taiwan as he could only find undesired jobs (eg. security officer) due to his age(53 now), ageism is really a thing here, and he had been seeking a chance to make a come back to his glorious days.\n\nMy dad doesn't understand a thing about investment, after he came back to Taiwan, he had been unemployed for years, only recently accepted the fact that he is not going to return the glorious days, then began to seek jobs that suit his age. Yes he spent nearly all of his money in maintaining this family. Namely feeding me and my grandparents.\n\nMy grandfather died in Jun 2022, with grandmother's health slowly deteriorating, we estimated her to leave this world in 5 years. The reason I brought this up is because she has a private property, the house in which I'm living currently worth \\~$300,000 USD, but there's going to be an inheritance dispute as my grandmother is very superstitious about death, my dad doesn't have an opportunity to convince her to sign a testament. Grandparents have 4 children.\n\nAfter the highschool, I was forced to complete the mandatory military service which this country considers as an obligation, further solidates my desire to leave. I don\u2019t wanna fight or die for a country that I don\u2019t even recognize as my home.\n\nFast forward, I'm now a sophomore student in university, my major is BSMIS and I'm expected to graduate in 2+ years. The university I go to is a national \"distance learning university\" if that makes sense to you.\n\nI work very hard, as I have to work and study simultaneously. I was hired as an intern MIS(Management Information System Specialist) working for Far Eastern Group(\u9060\u6771\u96c6\u5718) in Oct 2022. This role is kind of like a mixed of everything, where we have to maintain server and internet security, internet, PCs, laptops and IT help desk, anything related to \"hardware\" is our responsibility.\n\nThe pay is intolerable.\n\nI'm fully aware I'm not ready and qualified to immigrate at this point.\n\nRight now I'm fully committed to learning front-end technologies and finish my university in Taiwan ASAP.\n\nAnd I will find a front-end dev job in Taiwan to gain \\~3 years of working experience then maybe consider immigration. Then I'll see if I can be a fullstack or back-end software engineer in the future.\n\nI'm desperate and determined to leave Taiwan once and forever.\n\nSummary, what my situation is as following:\n\n* I am a 23M, my dad is a 53M, with Taiwan(ROC) nationality . I'm an intern MIS specialist and my dad is a swimming pool lifeguard.\n* My girlfriend is a 26F Indonesian, came to Taiwan as a foreign worker(care taker), she barely understands English. If she's not qualified I'll begin the process of immigration on my own without her, then maybe after I got PR or citizenship I might be able to bring my gf here by marriage. I'll bring my dad over once everything is ready too.\nOr maybe I'll marry her in Taiwan and she'll get Taiwanese nationality, once she does that, I'll ask her to be trained in a profession in demand like nurse etc.\n\n* My dad and gf fully support my idea to immigrate.\n* I have 3+ years of experience in part time jobs, the role I have now at Far Eastern Group is also a part time job. I have 3 months of working experience in full time as of now. I can't find a decent full time job without a bachelor degree in Taiwan.\n* Beginner level in front-end technologies, decently experienced with React.js, html, css and JS and I've built several side-projects and will further improve myself by using site like TheOdinProject\n* Intermediate level in MIS skills.\n* I have been learning python like Flask, not my focus at the moment.\n* I have a pilot license for civilian UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in Taiwan.\n* I have a strong interest in technology, now focusing on CS.\n* My mathematics is poor to say the least.\n* I speak and write English reasonably well, I can hold up casual conversation in English with ease.\n* I've never had TOEFL or IELTS or any kind, I will have English test in near future.\n* My native langauge is Traditional Chinese.\n* I'm at my second year in university, and will graduate with BSMIS major in 2 years.\n* Low income with nearly no saving.\n* I\u2019ve considered working holiday in Australia, but the job I have now at FEG is very stable, and finishing university is my top priority.\n\nCountries I've considered, ranking from most desirable to the least:\n\n1. Canada\n2. Australia\n3. New Zealand\n4. The USA\n\nAll kinds of suggestions are welcome, my options are not limited to those 4 countries listed above.\n\nPreferably an English speaking country. And I only consider a developed country.\n\nWhat I want is work and life balance with acceptable social welfare, salary is placed as the second important factor, that's why I ranked the USA to the bottom, also the requirement is too difficult for me.\n\nQuestion I have in mind: Is MIS considered a bad career in the west? Is there a demand for this? Due to this reason I chose to pursue career in SWE.\n\nEdit: because some people might misunderstand, I'm not going to immigrate immediately, I'll do it once I'm ready and qualified.\nI'm asking for advices I can do now, and any suggestions, opinions are welcome.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677706069.0},{"title":"[WeWantOut] 28F Nurse 9x US-> anywhere warm and safe","author":"shitimfuckedrn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11fh5g5\/wewantout_28f_nurse_9x_us_anywhere_warm_and_safe\/","text":"I\u2019m a Registered Nurse in California with three years of acute care experience and my BSN.

If I am a citizen in a foreign country and I marry my girlfriend, will my girlfriend obtain citizenship in my country automatically?? \n\nI was wondering which country would be the cheapest and easiest to move to from America.

That is why we are focusing on more training and further education, more female employment and flexible transitions to retirement. But we also need immigration from abroad to have enough skilled workers in the country. With the new Skilled Immigration Act, we are making the necessary progress*,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first year of the Skilled Workers Act has been considered successful, after within a year, 50,000 German visas have been issued to skilled third-country citizens under the Act, despite the pandemic and border closures.\n\nThe highest number of visas, 2,024, were granted to the citizens of Serbia, while other Balkan countries are also listed amongst the countries with the highest number of visas received. Bosnia and Herzegovina is listed seventh with 1,159 visas, whereas Kosovo and Albania are listed ninth and tenth, with 792 visas and 778 visas, respectively.\n\n\\>> [*Germany Warns of Radical Visa Reforms: We Will Turn the Procedures Upside Down*](https:\/\/www.schengenvisainfo.com\/news\/germany-warns-of-radical-visa-reforms-we-will-turn-the-procedures-upside-down\/)\n\n## EU Blue Card to Become Accessible for More Specialists With a University Degree\n\nThe first change that Germany intends to make to the Skilled Workers Act is to make [Germany\u2019s Blue Card](https:\/\/www.schengenvisainfo.com\/eu-blue-card\/germany\/) more accessible for a higher number of specialists who hold a university degree.\n\nIn addition, it also wants to make the migration system more alluring for foreigners to come to Germany for vocational training or study and then to further stay in the country, in order to strengthen its position as a leading country in the field of higher and professional education.\n\nThe [EU Blue Card is an EU residency document](https:\/\/www.schengenvisainfo.com\/eu-blue-card\/) granted by the Member States individually, to highly-qualified workers from outside the EU. The document grants its holder with the right to live and work in an EU country, provided they have higher professional qualifications, such as a university degree, and an employment contract or a binding job offer with a high salary compared to the average in the EU country where the job is.\n\nAfter initial work in the EU country that issued the Blue Card, its holder has the right to move and work in other countries, later on.\n\n## Formal Recognition of University Degrees No Longer Necessary\n\nSecond, the German government wants to permit third country citizens to move to work in Germany in their field of expertise without having to undergo the procedures for formal recognition of their degree and professional qualification.\n\n\u201c*In the future, it will be sufficient if someone can prove their qualification for a non-regulated profession through a foreign professional or university degree and professional experience*,\u201d the BMI says in a press release regarding the reforms.\n\nYet, it will remain a requirement for foreign workers to be offered a salary that is above the set threshold in order to ensure fair working conditions and pay for foreigners and prevent their exploitation.\n\n## Recognition of Professional Qualification Can Be Made After Arriving in Germany\n\nAs per those who want to have their foreign professional qualification recognised in Germany, the government wants to make it possible for them to initiate the process after they have entered the country, and not before, as it currently is.\n\nThe government believes that such a change will enable employers to hire foreign specialists more quickly, and at the same time, it will also be easier for the workers to have their qualification recognized in Germany, while also working in qualified employment.\n\n## Opportunity Card for Job Seekers to Come in Germany\n\nForeigners who haven\u2019t found a job in Germany from their home country will soon be able to move in Germany first, and then find a workplace.\n\nThis will be made possible through the Opportunity Card, a one-year valid jobseekers visa, which will be issued to foreigners according to a points-based system, which will evaluate the applicant\u2019s qualified employment.\n\nWith this visa, foreigners will be able to work in trial or secondary employment.\n\n## Short-Term Employment to Be Permitted in Specific Cases\n\nThe government also wants to make it possible for German employers to hire foreigners for short-term periods in cases when their needs are temporary needs, regardless of special qualification requirements.\n\nYet, the number of workers that will be hired this way will be capped, while the collective agreements and compulsory social security will ensure the protection of short-term employees.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677471662.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 24m welder Ireland -> mainland Europe","author":"Billopad209","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11dijke\/iwantout_24m_welder_ireland_mainland_europe\/","text":"Hi guys wondering would anyone be about to help with ideas on where to move to I have experience in all welding process's and can fabricate parts I also have some basic machining experience\n\nI am currently in an apprenticeship program here in Ireland but would look to move to somewhere in mainland Europe and expand my language skills and just live somewhere else for a while was personally thinking of the Netherlands or Germany possibly \n\nAny help would be appreciated","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677521590.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 38F Singapore -> Canada or UK","author":"astartetarte","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11d9uxg\/iwantout_38f_singapore_canada_or_uk\/","text":"Hello! I'm planning to move my family to either Canada or the UK. My husband (38M) is self-employed (games\/app development) and my son (9 years old) is on the autism spectrum. I'm a Marketing Communications Manager who has 16 years of work experience, mostly in events and conferences.\n\nThe biggest reason is really to look for a better environment for my son who is moderate on the spectrum. I wouldn't say Singapore is *super* bad, but it's a highly stressful environment, and most services and support are only catered for mild or severe autistic symptoms. My boy falls somewhere in between - he's good academically, but his cognitive delays do not allow him to thrive in a cookie-cutter environment.\n\nWe are thinking of getting permanent residency elsewhere at this point in time because we're inching toward our 40s and I believe it'll be a lot more difficult to relocate after.\n\n**Canada (More specifically, looking at either Calgary or Winnipeg)Pros**\n\n1. Great and inclusive education system, lots of support for autistic children and adults (correct me if I'm wrong).\n2. Lower cost of living (as compared to Singapore), less expensive real estate. My 1,185 sqft apartment is a 1.5h commute to town and already costs $600k, so you can imagine\n3. (Possibly) Shorter timeline to get PR, even if my partner goes on the self-employed visa route which assumably takes 2-3 years\n4. Less hectic, more liveable (love mountains), and a lot more likely for us to retire comfortably.\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. Singapore has banished all direct flights to Canada, so visiting family will be a huge pain in the butt.\n2. \"Canadian experience\" which neither of us has, so it's going to be a pain to find a job and one of us (most likely me) will need to go for further studies.\n3. Driving license not recognised, need to go through a lot of hassle to get a Canadian Class 5.\n4. Unsure if autism diagnosis in Singapore is admissible in Canada for access to services. If not, will have to pay 2k-3k for a private practitioner diagnosis (not a hard no, just one of the cons).\n\n**UK (most likely London, but living in a commuter town or Birmingham or Edinburgh)Pros**\n\n1. **(Biggest pro)** I've worked with UK MNCs based in Singapore, so technically I do have some sort of \"UK experience\". It'll be a lot easier for me to get a job, and it shouldn't be too hard for my partner as well.\n2. Less of a culture shock. Generally a lot more familiar with English people and culture. Singapore was a British colony, so even our education system is similar (GCE O levels, A levels, etc.) and British English is our first language.\n3. Much easier to convert my driving license.\n4. I have friends there and my sister might head to London for further studies, I would definitely feel a lot less alienated.\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. Cost of living is higher than Canada (Calgary\/Winnipeg).\n2. Longer time to get PR, need to work for about 5 years to be eligible.\n3. Not 100% sure I'll be able to retire comfortably due to the higher cost of living, eventually. Also not 100% sure it will be less stressful than Singapore.\n4. Autism diagnosis should be recognised, but unsure how to go about getting an EHC plan for support services. Also, didn't hear a lot of good things about NHS.\n5. **(Biggest con)** There is a likelihood that my boy's PR application will be rejected due to his autism diagnosis. I can't 100% confirm this though.\n\nI've yet to do more research (especially for UK), but found this forum and thought it'll be great to hear any insights. :)","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1677498147.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 20F US -> Canada","author":"KatH2002","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11e71ia\/iwantout_20f_us_canada\/","text":"I am a 20 year old transgender female in the USA, specifically Texas.

My only concern is that I don\u2019t know French. I\u2019m fairly good at learning languages since I speak 3 languages and I used to live in Israel where I became fluent in Hebrew within 2 years. So my first question:\n- When it comes time to apply for permanent residency when I\u2019m done with my studies will 4 years be enough to learn Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French?\n- How different is the path to permanent residency in Quebec than in other provinces?\n\nI plan to study political science or law through the BCL\/JD program and maybe double up with economics but my ultimate goal is to go to become a lawyer, specifically I want to work in corporate law and possibly become involved in local politics. So:\n- How different is the process of becoming an accredited lawyer in Canada than in the US?\n- Are corporate lawyers or lawyers in general a growing position in Canada\/Quebec?\n- How open are Canadian\/Quebec politics?\n\nIf I do move to Quebec I\u2019ll most definitely be living in Montreal, although I really like Quebec City.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1677383565.0},{"title":"[WeWantOut] 32M 31F Supply Chain Manager, High School Physics Teacher Turkey->EU Countries","author":"oziusas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/11bi6py\/wewantout_32m_31f_supply_chain_manager_high\/","text":"Hi, I am 32M working in a respected retailer overseeing production quality assurance for fashion products.

Just to clarify, my education was done purely within Singapore.\n\nSo I had tried searching for a job within the aviation sector, but to no avail. Ultimately, I got an IT job and have been working for almost close to 3 years now.\n\nSo there are multiple reasons that I want to migrate, but I will mention the ones that are the main driving factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Cost of living\n\nThe cost of living is definitely increasing. It is getting way to expensive to purchase a HDB apartment. I have to wait until 35 just to purchase 1 on my own, and even then, I'll probably have to work until maybe past retirement age just to fully pay it off. Renting is an option, but it is also bad as well; rents have has risen to untenable levels.\n\n2. Work-life balance\n\nThere is no work life balance here. In here, we wake up, go to work until late hours, then come back home, and then sleep. And the cycle just repeats itself. This one is pretty self-explanatory so I'll just leave it as that.\n\nSo my plan is to at least get permanent residency first, before getting citizenship. The countries I've listed are, from top to bottom, the countries of top to least preference.\n\n1. Australia\n\n2. EU\n\n 1. Germany\n\n 2. Denmark\/Norway\/Finland\/Sweden\n\n3. Canada\n\n4. USA\n\nAustralia is the first choice for me due to it's proximity to Singapore, as well as the usage of English. My thought was to get in via the Skilled visa, most likely either the 189 subclass or the 190 subclass visa routes. If I apply, it has to be now as i am getting on with age and will score lower on the point system this year after i turn 32.\n\nFor Germany, my understanding is that I'll have to secure employment first before I even apply long term employment visa? I'm not sure if my affiliation with TUM can help, but otherwise, I'm looking at the Germany General Employment Visa. Germany is my primary choice when it comes to the EU but I am considering the Nordic countries as well.\n\nFor USA, I understand we have the H-1B1 visa variant that is unique for only Singapore and Chile.\n\nSo if you guys are familiar with the process of Permanent residency for the aforementioned countries, and\/or what things I need to prepare and consider, please let me know in the comments.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated.

To apply to the school I wish to go to, I need to get my upper secondary education certificate (HS diploma) verified by UHR, the Swedish council for higher education.

Mental and physical health decline until finally I\u2019d had enough and decided to GET OUT. \n\n- got a small settlement after agreeing to an NDA. I lived off of that until I decided what to do.\n- I sold my condo and my car- donated my corporate wardrobe, packed up my stuff for shipping and was in contact with a realtor and lawyer in Belize organizing a land purchasing trip.\n \n\nMy plan was to buy beach front land, and build two small casitas to run as a small bnb and a main house for myself. I trained as a childbirth educator and doula so that I could donate my services and contribute to the local community.\n\n %%%%\n\n& TLDR- bought investment property in hometown where am currently on Mat leave, living in childhood home. \n\n&&&&\nI Had a fling and fell pregnant (birth control failure). I found out 3 weeks before my condo closed.  I decided to keep the pregnancy.\n\n- I got an entry level corporate job and worked 6 months to re-qualify for maternity and parental leave as well as a mortgage \n- I purchased another property from proceeds of sale, in my hometown, and rented it out as an investment property. \n- NB: My brother is a realtor so I do private sales and avoid realtor fees and so can re-sell this property is a couple years without losing out.\n- Currently on month 15 of and 18 month parental leave. \n\n&&&&\n\n\nSo now for the reason for the post:\n\n\u00a3 TLDR: corporate life is soul-crushing and made me dead inside but is the only viable option to support my daughter in Canada due to skyrocketing costs of living and housing crisis. \n\n\u00a3 \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\nI cannot return to the corporate lifestyle in any capacity- please don\u2019t suggest a different flavour. I tried to work an entry level role w less responsibility in the finance sector but I\u2019m not cut out for doing less than I\u2019m capable of, the culture was very similar and my leader very quickly told me when I return from leave I need to move into a more suitable role for my skill level. But I just know I\u2019ll end up in the same dark place of overworking and burnout and I don\u2019t want to be that kind of parent\/person. \n\nThe dilemma is that I earned 6 figures comfortably and have the highest earning potential in the corporate sector. It\u2019s  not feasible for me to go back to school and retrain. Anything else I\u2019m interested in requires years of education and experience to get even half way to my previous salary. It will be near impossible for me to support my daughter and I comfortably without a corporate salary as costs of living are skyrocketing and an average salary is not a living salary anymore.\n\n\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\n\n#GET OUT 2.0: this time with a baby.\n\nI still want to consider running a bnb but now would need to consider:\n- land with quick access to medical care ( i.e. no water-access only Cayes etc.) \n- existing property\/ main house on land with space to build\n- Existing and stable utilities infrastructure ( no off-grid options)\n- safe school system (ie. not America)\n- decent healthcare system\n- crime\/safety \n\nI\u2019m open to other options. But as I plan to return to Canada eventually for my daughter to attend high-school and may stay until she completes university- I need to do something where I can have some means to return with. I.e selling the property or renting it out to support us while in Canada. \n\nRelevant information:\n\n- no custody concerns nor child support\n- ~250k USD available for move land\/property purchase and can show retirement savings of ~70k ( sometimes relevant for retirement type visas); I\u2019m willing to delay for a year or so and return to work to add more to that amount \n- need to be able to support myself and a child comfortably by either generating income through property or other means\n- Anti-black Racism is a factor- would likely avoid parts of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. I\u2019m experienced in navigating racism in Western Europe, South America and North America but would avoid very small towns or conservative areas\n- Will likely return to Canada by the time my daughter is high school age.\n- Previous experience in teaching ESL, childcare, doula\/birth attendant, childbirth educator ( these are all services I would be able and hoping to donate)\n\n!! TLDR- recognition of the fact this post dripping with privilege \n\n!!!\nI want to recognize the incredible privilege contained in this type of a post.

California will always be my home, but the cost of living here will become unsustainable in the long run unless I suddenly become wealthy in the next few years. I keep my current housing costs down by sharing a house with people. If I moved to us to Europe, I would buy or build a home of my own to live in for a fraction of what it costs to do so here.\n\nI want my first scouting trip to be at least a month-long as this is a massive life decision, so it probably won't happen until early next year. In the meantime, I'd be eternally grateful for any friendly advice folks have to offer regarding the matter.\n\n**Culture:** I could also use a culture change. California has evolved into a place where everyone is working and hustling all day to get by, meaning people don't have the time, capacity, or \"bandwidth,\" as we say, for friendships, community, and even dating. As my 40s approach, I want to spend the rest of my life somewhere where the pace is a little slower and people are (hopefully) a bit warmer. Spain and Portugal sound perfect, as I wouldn't have to sacrifice access to culture and good weather like I would if I moved somewhere else in the US. I've lived on the east coast before for school(undergrad & grad x2), where my priced-out family now lives, and I have to say I'm not impressed. The rest of the US is too car-centric and segregated from everything else for my taste. I'd like not to need a car to exist. \n\n\\- How friendly are locals in either location?\n\n\\- Has anyone relocated with a dog before? How welcome are they?\n\n\\- Is it challenging to find housing as a foreigner trying to establish residency? \n\n\\- Other than language, what are the cultural differences between Spain and Portugal?\n\n\\- Is there a decent work\/life balance?\n\n\\- Will racism or homophobia be a problem? Especially in smaller cities and rural areas?\n\n**Qualifications:** I have a bachelor's and two master's degrees in architecture, urban planning, and design, with about five years of professional experience, not including internships and a break during the pandemic. My specializations are land use, parks, open space, and transportation planning. I'm good a digital rendering, 3d modeling, animation, and video production. After becoming comfortable speaking & comprehending Spanish\/Portuguese, I'd love to teach or consult there eventually. \n\n\\- Is there a demand for people with my skillset in Spain or Portugal?\n\n\\- Are teaching\/research positions challenging to find?\n\n\\- Would I be able to start my own practice eventually as a foreigner?\n\n**Language**: I am not yet fluent in either Spanish or Portuguese, but they don't intimidate me. The opportunity to immerse myself in a new language is exciting. With practice and effort, Spanish will be the easiest to learn since this is California, and my housemates are native speakers. I speak some Portuguese and have access to online courses and a pen pal who is a native of Portugal who I can practice with. When I arrive in either county, I'd like to take Es\/Pt classes at a university to improve my fluency and eventually allow me to speak like an architect in the local tongue. \n\n\\- Are there university courses specifically designed to help non-native speakers become fluent?\n\n\\- Being mindful of the difference in Spanish dialects, will the Latin-American Spanish I learn here in California help me in the Madrid region?\n\n\\- Is entering as a student (to learn the language) an option to reach resident status?\n\n**Visa**: I'm considering the digital nomad visa. My company primarily works locally in SF and the surrounding area, so I'm still determining if I could work remotely with them, even if we are currently hybrid. I'll be teaching online courses soon, which I could pivot to someday and help me qualify. \n\nANY advice on visas and the roadmap to permanent residency will be appreciated.\n\n**Thank you kindly!!!**","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1676849553.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 28nb Disabled US -> CA\/EU\/Elsewhere","author":"literallycain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/117lulk\/iwantout_28nb_disabled_us_caeuelsewhere\/","text":" edit: the downvotes and comments are really telling.\n\nLaws are being passed in the United States that are making it increasingly difficult and scary to exist as a Black Trans person.

I have previously worked in the food service industry for about 7 years and have had a variety of internships in labs and biology related jobs (3x 4mo internships), often doubling up my jobs in the summer. My current salary is at the poverty line and I have very little hopes of getting it all that much higher, even doubling it feels, while yes amazing, not adequate due to the cost of living. I currently live in one of the most expensive places in the country and am forced to live within the county because of my job. I understand I can take a job elsewhere in the country and am exploring that too, but I have other issues as well with this country. I am always applying for new jobs in this country but everything seems to take 5 years experience or a Masters or both. \nI currently only speak English. I very much enjoy walking and not having to drive, something that I cannot do here because the area is so rich and much if the US is unwalkable. I like beer, rock climbing, and video games. \n\nAlso I still have about 10k in college debt but its slowly getting paid off. I have no idea what effect this could have on my leaving but maybe it's worth noting.\n\n\n\n1) Where?\nThe biggest question is if I were to leave where would I go?\nI have a friend in Chile that's always talking it up but we both agree not speaking Spanish means I'd never make it there. There's a lot of Europe, but when I google jobs in my field over there I can never find good results (I probably need to get a vpn and set it to some european countries). I need this country to pay me more than just a living wage, which means either the salary equal to what I earn with a lower cost of living (almost a guarantee), or more with an equal cost of living.\nAre there other first world english speaking places too?\n\n 1.5) Culture (Where)?\n  I dont like american culture. I don't like guns, I abhor police, I hate our money driven justice system, I hate how long we sentence convicts for constantly, I hate how anti climate change we are, I hate how no one talks to anyone, I hate having to drive everywhere, I hate how much power we give money, I hate our military, I hate our censorship, I hate that I have no healthcare!  Frankly I'm pretty open to lots of ideas though.\n\nI hear all the time that I could just move anywhere else in the world and have 80% of these issues go away. So maybe culture isn't a huge issue in the \"where\" section but some insight would be nice.\n\n\n\n2) How?\nHow does someone leave? I read a lot of stories here about people being happy for leaving, but how do you get the money? How did you search for the jobs? How did you get housing? What were your biggest challenges? How once you get there do you assimilate into the culture? \n\n\n\n3) Crimes!\nI have a class 1 misdemeanor permanently on my record from, honestly, not too long ago. How will this affect my immigration? I wouldn't even plan to leave for at least another year at minimum for legal reasons and possibly another year past that for personal reasons. Does this kill my chances of ever leaving?

If I did my calculations correctly, I should be left with about 4700$ after taxes, average living expenses in OR are 3500$, so I should be fine.\n\nNow to my questions:\n\n* Is that a competitive salary in the U.S. for an engineering job?\n* What exactly is the difference between vacation and PTO? I only found conflicting answers online.\n* I'm used to the free healthcare in my country, is there a health insurance that covers everything without copay or deductible? (within a reasonable price range)\n* What happens if I run out of sickdays? 5 days seem a bit silly\n* Is it hard or at all possible for an outsider to find an apartement? I heard that it can be very difficult to find one, even as a US citizen, especially around the bigger cities.\n* Are there any other expenses I should consider? Extra insurances perhaps?\n* What is your guys's opinion about OR? I've been there a couple of times and found the people to be very nice, but moving there is a completely different level.\n\nThank you guys so much for your help in advance!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for sharing your insight and the helpful information. Thanks to all letting me know that their offer is rather low, I will definitely try negotiating with them. \n\nThey just sent me a rather complicated insurance table (which sadly I can't share cos pictures aren't allowed here), perhaps you guys can give me your opinion on that as well. I will try to abbreviate it here to the best of my abilities\n\n\\------------------------\n\nEmployee contribution: 50$ bi weekly (so the insurance costs 100$ a month, yes?)\n\nAnnual Deductible: 2500$\n\nMax Out-Of-Pocket: 4000$\n\nCopay varies between 10 to 250 $, depending on the service\n\nIt includes primary care, urgent care, emergency room, x-ray and all sorts of things\n\nIt also includes dental insurance with a deductible of 50$ and a Vision Insurance with a copay of 10$ and a Life & Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance for up to 150.000 $\n\nPlus they match 401k contributions up to 4% of the salary.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nSo that means, I get hit by a car, I only have to pay 4,000$ and the rest is covered by the insurance? How can it be so cheap? 100$ per month seems very reasonable to me.

(Considering safety and healthcare)  Price isn't the issue, see above, but if I can live cheaper with about the same benefit why not?\n\n2) Pros of Merida mexico are its closer, and maybe we buy a winter house there before moving back and we can continue to live there on short term basis after this adventure.  Cons for mexico is its hot!  We live in colorado and get a few days over 100 but its also very dry.  We've traveled to cancun a few tims and not been bothered by it but it has always been short term travel not living there.  What else should we consider?\n\n3) Pros of cuenca Equador - the weather.

But my budget is super limited. Anybody have any tips on what I can do, based on my situation?\n\nQuick background about me:\n\n* Filipino citizen\n* 29-year-old female\n* Work experience in FMCG marketing + content marketing (writing)\n* Degree in AB Communication Arts (DLSU) with a solid CGPA\n* Currently employed (fully remote job, PH-standard salary)\n\nBiggest struggles:\n\n* Don't know where to start researching; too many options\n* Don't know which migration route is the cheapest \/ fastest ROI\n* Don't know what the cost is for everything (e.g., agencies, tests, applications, etc.)\n* Budget is limited. Savings is roughly P500k and no financial support from family.\n* Want to avoid taking a loan \/ borrowing money. But will consider if necessary.\n* I don't have family in Australia, but I have friends who migrated there (possible to bum at their place temporarily but they're not in Adelaide, where I plan to move to)\n\nMain goals:\n\n* Start the migration process this year (2023)\n* Target to move to Australia within the next few years (no exact timeframe, just ASAP)\n* Keep costs to a minimum (and with a clear breakdown, ideally)\n* Move to Adelaide, Darwin, or anywhere South Australia\n* Ok to study, ok to work, ok to be a working student, ok to apply for scholarships\n\nMain reasons why:\n\n* I want to work for a better environment. Compared to the PH where the wages are forever low and lifestages can\u2019t keep up with career growth (e.g., late 20s already and still can barely afford to support myself), Australia gives better opportunities both short- and long-term.\n* I want to build a communication career where it\u2019s appreciated. Writers are treated like shit in the PH. Where I work, I'm basically like a call center agent being hired by my white boss because PH labor costs are peanuts.\n* I want to start my own business. Starting a business in the PH is easy, but it\u2019s not sustainable, compared to starting on in Australia where the landscape helps and is fit for long-term business growth. They have tons of resources and support for small businesses.\n* I want to follow an important loved one who's moving to Australia for good (Adelaide, in particular). This isn't the most logical reason, I know, but it's still important to me regardless of your opinion (heh).\n* Plus, you know, better healthcare, social security, education opportunities... And if I eventually do achieve and get there, I can give my near-senior-citizen parents an option for a better country to retire in and enjoy their remaining years.\n\nAny insider tips, expert guidance, experienced-based help, and thought-provoking questions are greatly appreciated.

Has anybody here applied for the HPI visa of UK? If yes, and if you have moved to the UK, what has been your experience like?\n\nThe UK government launched a new visa scheme in July 2022 called High Potential Individual (HPI). To qualify, you need to have graduated from a top 50 university of the world within the last 5 years. I qualify the criteria, so I applied for the verification of my credentials, and I got approved. It was only then that I started looking into it more seriously, and I found out that it costs a bit of money - health insurance fee of \u00a31250 for the primary applicant, \u00a3625 for the spouse, and \u00a3312 for each child, and \u00a3750 for the visa application fees. So, at a combined \u00a33000 for me, it's not a trivial amount of money, and so I've been considering if it's worth the effort and the cost.\n\nMy reasons for wanting to move:\n\n1. I work in tech (specifically as a data scientist and machine learning engineer), and there's just not too many tech companies of repute in Hong Kong. Most companies of repute here are from fintech, and I think I've hit a ceiling here in terms of tech roles. If I need to progress in my career, I'll need to move into management in these companies, which I'm not particularly interested in, if given a choice. I'd rather try my luck in a different country in big tech companies like MANGA, Airbnb, etc or at big car companies like BMW, Merc, etc in their autonomous driving division.\n2. Homes are too small and costs are prohibitively expensive to start a family in HK. As a single person, its ok; but I have a kid now, and I wouldn't be able to afford the kind of life I want with a household income of anything below HK$ 100k per month, which doesn't look likely because of point 1 above and point 3 below.\n3. My wife works in the publishing industry, and there's hardly any roles for non-Chinese speakers in HK. There are only 2 companies of repute in the publishing space in HK (don't want to name them here), wife was working for one of them until 2021 when they had to close shop in HK completely due to covid, so her whole office was laid off. She continued to work with her team in the UK remotely as a contractor until the project she was handling was completed in mid 2022, and since then she's been unable to find any jobs here. In the 3 years she's been applying for jobs in HK, she's got only 2 interviews, one of which led to the aforementioned job.\n\nThe major factors that have been deterring me from applying for the HPI visa of the UK are:\n\n1. the UK is in a recession now, as is most of the world I guess, so it might be difficult to get a job as soon as I move.\n2. even if I get a job, the salaries in the UK seem to be ridiculously low sometimes, from what I've heard from my contacts there. Like, only \u00a330-40k per annum sometimes even for senior roles, depending on the location.\n3. the HPI visa is valid only for a duration of 2 years, after which it can't be extended. If I need to continue to stay in the UK, I'll need to find a company willing to sponsor me a work visa.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I'd love to know from people who have applied for the HPI visa and moved to the UK if it has been worth the \u00a32000 (if you're single) or \u00a33000 (if you're married with a kid) application fee. You can also educate me about some other benefits of this visa besides using it as a work permit, if there is any, and also about any disadvantages of moving to the UK that I have not considered.\n\nAlso, are there alternate visas that I can apply for, like skilled worker visa, whose terms would be much more favourable compared to the HPI visa? The non-renewability beyond 2 years of the HPI visa is a bummer and a big deterrent for me, in particular.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1676468503.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 22F Student Indonesia -> Europe","author":"Fixmyn26issue","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/1139d87\/iwantout_22f_student_indonesia_europe\/","text":"Hello fellow Expats,\n\nI'm studying cinema in a private school in Paris.

I\u2019m thinking of starting over from a Bachelor\u2019s in Computer Science, preferably switching over to a career path in IT.\n\nBackground & Available Resources:\n- I speak fluent English (TOEFL-iBT 114) and Japanese.\n- I\u2019m graduating med school and will have a *Japanese* medical liscense + Bachelor\u2019s in Medicine in March 2024. *I don\u2019t have a research paper* (Med schools in Japan are like vocational schools that starts at 18 years old).\n- Parents are doctors, so they might be able to provide financial support for maybe <$50,000 a year, for <4 years. (Japanese doctors aren\u2019t filthy levels of rich like they are in the US)\n\nNegative Motives:\nBefore you say \u201ceconomically speaking every country is shitty to live in as an immigrant\u201d, yes I know that. I want to emphasize that I want to get out of Japan for mostly cultural reasons. \n- Japan is an extremely shitty country to live in.\nI can\u2019t express this vast info in a short post. You\u2019ve probably heard of the environment we live in, especially the work culture.\n- I want to move to a country that is not Confucianist.\nWe are so collectivist & conformist here, people do not have personal boundaries, diversity is not tolerated. Japan seem to be confidently going on a path towards the far right, as not only the dinosaurs but also young people tend to have conservative views. We are so isolated from the world because of the language barrier, so internally-motivated social progressivism is not a thing here.\n\nPositive Motives\/Ideals:\n- Healthcare without US level of privatization\n- LGBT friendly environment (I\u2019m nonbinary, the post title is for convenience\u2019s sake)\n- Decent food \n- College tuition <$100K\/year\n\n Other Info:\n- I don\u2019t want to go to a country that doesn\u2019t have English as its primary language, bc I plan on moving there permanently. Being able to read social cues & understand official paperwork is important. \n\n\nGiven all this, I previously concluded that I might move to Canada by enrolling in a college, then getting a post-grad visa.\nHowever, I noticed the amount of Canadians wanting to move out of their own country, and I\u2019m wondering once again on which English-speaking country I should move to.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you <3\n\n\n\n\nEdit (Additional Info)\n\nWhy I\u2019m not becoming a (clinical) doctor:\n- The inhumane work hours. At least in Japan, you\u2019re expected to work 12hrs\/day, no weekends, 36 hour shifts once a week, about <7 days of holidays per year. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not this bad in every country, but afaik doctors in most countries  have abysmal work-life balance, which is extremely important for me. Please tell me if that\u2019s not the case where you moved to.\n- The sheer amount of study, money, and work you need to put in to become a doctor in another country is insane compared to other occupational fields, *even if you have a Japanese medical license*. Some countries even require you to start your medical education from scratch.\n\nAcademia is also not a very good option for me bc of the low pay and not-so-good work-life balance. Again, please tell me if that\u2019s not the case in specific countries. \n\nAs for the reasons I\u2019m choosing IT:\n- Just plain interest in the field.\n- The job opportunities are pretty good even by STEM standards, which is crucial for an immigrant.\n- A lot of skills carry over to other countries relative to being a doctor.\n\nIf you could suggest other specific occupations in specific countries, that would also help!\n\nAs for the climate, I\u2019ve lived in a snowy area in Japan for most of my life, so it\u2019s not much of a problem for me. Maybe if I go too far north\/south the reduced sunlight hours might be a problem.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676265777.0},{"title":"[WeWantOut] 24f and 26m in southeast US -> East Coast town","author":"casualselfhatred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/1119ulx\/wewantout_24f_and_26m_in_southeast_us_east_coast\/","text":"My boyfriend (26m) is a project manager at an environmental consultant company, majored in biology and is wanting to get a new job and get into coding.

Programs we\u2019ve grown to rely on are changing and getting more competitive and unpredictable, there is a massive backlog causing delays, Immigration (\u201cIRCC\u201d) are increasingly relying on AI, and we are seeing many generic and often unfair refusals for temporary visas. \n\nSo, we thought we\u2019d give you a rundown of how Canadian immigration works these days, what to do if your application is delayed\/refused, and a couple of insights along the way. We will be focusing on individual economic immigration. But feel free to ask about family immigration, refugee or humanitarian & compassionate options (please don\u2019t ask about business because we don\u2019t do that kind of work).\n\nHappy to answer any questions that we can \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDISCLOSURE: This is a confusing time and we hope this post helps, especially if you're DIYing your immigration. But we are also licensed professionals, so if this post makes you want to look us up and book a consultation, we'd be happy to help. \n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis guide contains some generalizations, as it is not possible to account for every scenario. You should not use it as an ultimate immigration guide, but merely as a starting point in your research.\n\n**Intro**  \n Canadian immigration programs tend to prioritize educated professionals with strong English and\/or French skills, especially in the industries that are experiencing labour shortages, e.g. healthcare & IT. Canada also seeks to attract more French speakers, so if you speak both official languages or if your French is strong, you might have a slight advantage.\n\nCanada also offers numerous pathways to graduates of some Canadian post-secondary institutions. In general, Canadian education is very popular since immigration programs are getting more and more competitive every year, and a Canadian degree\/diploma can tip the balance in your favour. However studying in Canada \u2260 guaranteed immigration.\n\nIf you have a family member (most commonly, a spouse or a common-law partner or a parent, if you\u2019re under 22), you may be able to immigrate through them. Other relatives usually cannot sponsor you, but in some cases they can slightly improve your chances of immigration.\n\nLastly, if you are already in Canada and have very unique and very compelling circumstances, and\/or are facing danger if returned to your country of origin, you may be eligible for making a refugee claim\\* or immigration on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This isn\u2019t really an immigration pathway, it\u2019s more of a last resort for people who are in complex and messy immigration situations.\n\n\\*There are exceptions to this, and some people can be resettled as refugees by UNHCR officer outside Canada, or sponsored by Canadians, but this post won\u2019t cover these options.\n\n**So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a regular professional without close family in Canada and not in any danger. There are two ways you can immigrate:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Apply for      permanent residence from abroad and land in Canada as a permanent      resident. This process can take anywhere between 1-4 years (from the      moment you submit the application).\n* Come to Canada      as a worker\/student to become eligible to apply for permanent residence      (PR) from inside Canada. This process usually takes a minimum of 1.5-2      years from the moment you land in Canada, usually longer.\n\nThe first option tends to be more difficult, since it usually requires the candidate to have one or more of the following:\n\na) A highly competitive profile, which can look like superior language skills in one or both of Canada\u2019s official languages, years of skilled work experience, and post-secondary education at a high level (Bachelor\u2019s degree and higher).\n\nb) Work experience in an in-demand profession.\n\nc) A Canadian employer willing to jump through lots of hoops and pay high fees to hire you.\n\nd) Strong connections to a specific province.\n\nd) Strong French skills.\n\nTherefore, many people opt for the second option, and come to Canada as workers, students, or sometimes even visitors, and subsequently become eligible for one of Canada\u2019s immigration pathways.\n\nI will start with Option 1 and cover some Option 2 scenarios afterwards.\n\n**What immigration pathways are out there?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Canada has      Federal, Provincial, and community-driven immigration programs. Federal programs      are more competitive. Provincial and community-driven programs tend to      have lower requirements but often require that the individual has      connections to the province\/community. The connections usually need to be      in form of work or studies in the province\/community or a job offer.      However, sometimes having relatives, friends, or having visited the      province\/community can be enough.\n* Most Canadian      immigration pathways are point-based, which means you are assigned points      based on your age, education, work experience, connections to Canada,      language skills, etc. So, even if you read program requirements and you      think that you meet the minimum eligibility criteria \u2013 that does not      necessarily mean that you can realistically immigrate through the program      of your choice. \n* Temporary      pathways. Sometimes Canada creates new temporary pathways to meet its      immigration goals. E.g. TR to PR during Covid, a pathway for out-of-status      construction workers. If it sounds too good to be true, double-check, it      may no longer be valid. \n\n**Express Entry (EE)**\n\n**Disclaimer:** EE is probably what most people know when it comes to Canadian immigration. However, this year (2023) the system will be undergoing significant changes and it will favour candidates in in-demand occupations and potentially candidates with Canadian education\/work experience. What are those occupations? We don\u2019t know yet. Do I think you should still consider this pathway? Absolutely. \n\nEE is a Federal Immigration system that manages intake into 3 immigration programs: [Federal Skilled Worker](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/federal-skilled-workers.html)(FSW), [Canadian Experience Class](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/canadian-experience-class.html) (CEC), and [Federal Skilled Trades](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/skilled-trades.html) (FST). In addition to that, there are some Provincial Immigration programs that are processed through Express Entry. I would normally suggest that people look at EE as a starting point, but it has become increasingly competitive over the years. \n\n**How does EE work?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Read the      eligibility requirements for the 3 programs and confirm that you are      eligible for at least one of them.\n2. Write an [immigration-approved      English\/French test](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/documents\/language-requirements\/language-testing.html) and have your highest Educational      Credential assessed by a [designated      organization](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/documents\/education-assessed\/how.html).\n3. Create a      free [online      profile](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/submit-profile.html).\n4. Get an      invitation to apply (if you are amongst the highest scoring candidates or      a province nominates you).\n5. Submit an      application for permanent residence.\n\n**How do you know if your profile is competitive for any programs managed through Express Entry?**\n\nThese are the steps:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Calculate your      score using the [online      tool:](https:\/\/www.cic.gc.ca\/english\/immigrate\/skilled\/crs-tool.asp)\n2. Check [scores](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/mandate\/policies-operational-instructions-agreements\/ministerial-instructions\/express-entry-rounds.html) under      your program or \u201cNo program specified\u201d and see where you stand. Right now      scores are pretty high, but before COVID-19 they were in 470s. There were      some crazy low scores in 2021 as the government were trying really hard to      hit their immigration objectives, but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to go this low      in the foreseeable future. \n3. See if there      is any way you can improve the score. Try additional education, getting a      better language score, more work experience, and\/or sometimes if you\u2019re      immigrating with a spouse, see if making the other person the      primary(principal) applicant will do the trick.\n\n**EE Advantages:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fast (ish)      processing times. Some applications take as little as 2-3 months, some      take closer to 1-2 years.\n* Straightforward      and transparent application process (for now).\n\n**EE Disadvantages:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It\u2019s difficult      to plan ahead since the program will be changing in the upcoming months,      and current scores are so competitive that most people without a Canadian      education\/work experience cannot take advantage of this pathway right      away.\n\nNow, about the programs.\n\n[**Federal Skilled Worker Program**](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/federal-skilled-workers.html) **(FSW)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Who is it for:** Highly educated      young professionals with superior language skills, who don\u2019t necessarily      have any work experience in Canada. You can still use this program if you      have Canadian work experience, including work experience while studying in      Canada.\n* [Eligibility      requirements](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/federal-skilled-workers.html) can be accessed by visiting the      government website. Basically, you need to score at least 67 points in      the [selection      grid](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/federal-skilled-workers\/six-selection-factors-federal-skilled-workers.html). You must also have at least 1 year (1560      hours over 12 months) of continuous (= no breaks) work experience in the      same skilled position (i.e. you can switch companies, but you cannot      switch the type of work you do).\n\nYou might need to research what work experience is considered skilled, what continuous work experience means, and how to calculate 1 year of work experience. Consider looking into [this resource](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/federal-skilled-workers.html#skilled).\n\n[**Canadian Experience Class**](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/canadian-experience-class.html) **(CEC)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Who is it for:** People      with at least 1 year of full-time (or equivalent part-time) skilled work      experience in Canada. This pathway is often used by people who came to      Canada as workers or students who transitioned to a work permit after      graduation. It\u2019s flexible, your work experience doesn\u2019t have to be      continuous or in the same position, as long as it\u2019s skilled.\n* **How can you      get Canadian work experience?** I have more info in the \u201cComing to Canada as      a Worker\u201d part, but you can sometimes work after you complete a Canadian      program of studies, some people can get a work permit based on their      nationality, some can work because their spouse\/partner is      studying\/working in Canada, and the rest usually need an employer willing      to bring them to Canada. \n* **Eligibility      requirements** are listed on the [government      website](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/canadian-experience-class.html). However, be careful, since self-employment      and unauthorized employment are not eligible for this program, and so is      employment during your studies **in Canada**.\n\n[**Federal Skilled Trades**](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/skilled-trades.html) **(FST)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Who is it for:      people with work experience in skilled trades, namely:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [IRCC](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/skilled-trades.html#skilled)\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure if your occupation fits the criteria, go to the [ESDC website](https:\/\/noc.esdc.gc.ca\/), find your occupation, and verify your choice by comparing your duties to the NOC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The      remaining [eligibility      requirements](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/skilled-trades.html) are listed on the government website.\n\nOkay, so what if Express Entry is a no go. What else can you do?\n\nAsk yourself,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you speak      French and English?\n* Do you have      connections to any Canadian provinces? E.g., family, prior visits? \n* Do you have      in-demand skills that could land you a job in Canada, e.g. you are a      software engineer?\n* Do you have a      professional background that happens to correspond with labour shortages      in certain provinces, e.g. healthcare, IT, skilled trades, truck driving?\n\nNow I\u2019m going to show you why asking these questions is important.\n\n**Provincial and Community-Driven Immigration Options**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Alberta,      British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador,      Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island,      Saskatchewan, and Yukon have various immigration pathways for people      interested in immigrating to that province. You can [learn      more about these programs](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/provincial-nominees\/works.html) on the province\u2019s website.\n* You may have      noticed that I omitted the province of Quebec. Quebec stands completely      separately when it comes to immigration, since it has its own programs and      selection criteria, which is why I didn\u2019t include it in this article.\n* Community-driven      Immigration Options include [Atlantic      Immigration Program](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/atlantic-immigration.html) and [Rural      and Northern Immigration Pilot Program](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/rural-northern-immigration-pilot\/pr-eligibility.html). They have      lower requirements, but a job offer with the community is a must.\n\n**Provinces that can nominate you from the Express Entry Pool of Candidates:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ontario [nominates](https:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/page\/ontarios-express-entry-human-capital-priorities-stream) people      with strong French and English skills (both at the same time), and people      who have work experience in certain in-demand occupations. You can see      what professions get invited [here.](https:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/page\/2023-ontario-immigrant-nominee-program-updates)\n* Alberta      favours people in certain occupations, people whose first language is      French, people who studied in Canada, and people with family in Alberta.      Read more [here](https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/ainp-alberta-express-entry-stream-eligibility.aspx#jumplinks-0) and [here.](https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/aaip-updates.aspx) \n* Nova Scotia\u2019s      nominations are a little less transparent, and the province often invites      people who fit very narrow requirements that address the province\u2019s labour      shortages\/needs. However, you can learn more about it [here](https:\/\/novascotiaimmigration.com\/move-here\/labour-market-priorities\/).\n* Saskatchewan\u2019s[ nominations](https:\/\/www.saskatchewan.ca\/residents\/moving-to-saskatchewan\/live-in-saskatchewan\/by-immigrating\/saskatchewan-immigrant-nominee-program\/browse-sinp-programs\/applicants-international-skilled-workers\/occupation-requirements) usually      correspond to in-demand occupations for that province.\n\n\\*Always check the provincial website to find out if you need to register an expression of interest with them or if just an Express Entry profile is enough.\n\n**Provinces that don\u2019t require a job offer for some of their immigration streams are:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Saskatchewan,      New Brunswick, and PEI \u2013 you may be eligible apply if you have an      in-demand occupation.\n* British      Columbia, Ontario, Newfoundland, Manitoba \u2013 you can apply if you are a      Canadian Master\u2019s of PhD graduate. Make sure to review program      requirements to see what study programs are acceptable for these      immigration pathways.\n\n**International Graduates**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Depending on      the province\/community where you studied\/are currently working, you will      most likely be able to access some sort of a pathway meant for      international graduates. So, check out the provincial nominee programs as      well as regional (AIP and RNIP) programs.\n* However, your      options will often depend on whether you studied at a private or public      institution, whether your studies were undergraduate or (post)graduate,      how long you studied for, and even the subjects you studied.\n* In general,      you\u2019re better off if you graduated from a public institution, and your      program was either a little longer (2 years or more), or it was a Master\u2019s      of a PhD.\n* **Opportunities      New Brunswick** is a notable exception that allows      international graduates of **several** **private career      colleges** apply for PR straight after graduating if they meet      certain [requirements.](https:\/\/www.welcomenb.ca\/content\/wel-bien\/en\/private-college-pilot-program.html)\n\nA work of warning: sometimes changing provinces can be a disadvantage and it can disqualify you. E.g. you studied in one province and moved to another one to work. So, do your research.\n\n**French and Common In-demand Skills**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Multiple      provinces, such as Ontario, Alberta, and New Brunswick, try to attract      people who are fluent\/highly proficient French speakers.\n* Multiple      provinces have pathways for people in Healthcare Occupations.\n* If you      have [unique      professional background in IT](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/employment-social-development\/services\/foreign-workers\/global-talent\/requirements.html#ust), it might be easier for Canadian      companies to hire you, since they may be able to do so through Global      Talent stream. Also, many provinces have pathways for candidates in      technical occupations, such as British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan,      and Manitoba.\n* Truck driving      is a good profession for immigration to Saskatchewan, Ontario, British      Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland &      Labrador, and Nova Scotia.\n\n**Manitoba:**\n\n[Manitoba](https:\/\/immigratemanitoba.com\/immigrate-to-manitoba\/) is often overlooked due to its tough climate. However, it\u2019s a real gem when it comes to immigration. You may be able to immigrate to Manitoba if you have connections to the province, such as family, friends, previous education, or work in Manitoba. Yes, you read that right, friends can help you immigrate, check out the Skilled Workers Overseas steam. You will, of course, need to meet other requirements, so make sure to review the programs offered by the province of Manitoba.\n\n**Job offer**\n\nMany programs ask you to have a job offer, but that usually does **not** mean that your friend who owns a restaurant can write a letter saying she\/he will hire you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Job offer is      NOT just a letter from a prospective employer or the fact that you\u2019re      employed in Canada,** e.g. when you have an open work permit on a      Working Holiday or Post Graduate open work permit. Job offer usually      requires that your employer shows that they could not recruit a      Canadian\/Permanent Resident, and they had to resort to hiring a foreign      worker. Check the requirements of the specific immigration pathway you\u2019re      considering because they differ from province\/community to      province\/community.\n* Generally,      all **provinces have immigration pathways for applicants with a job      offer from that province**. Make sure to check the requirements that      pertain to the employer, wage, whether your professional background needs      to be related to the job you\u2019re being offered, and recruitment      requirements (i.e., does your employer need to prove they couldn\u2019t hire a      Canadian\/PR and how they need to prove it).\n* If job offer      is the only way to go, consider looking into the [Atlantic      Immigration Program](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/atlantic-immigration.html) and the [Rural      and Northern Immigration Pilot](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/rural-northern-immigration-pilot.html). These community-driven pathways      have an established and straightforward system for employers looking to      hire foreign workers. Therefore, securing a job offer in these communities      might be a tiny bit easier.\n\n**Coming to Canada as a Worker**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There are some      pathways that provide easy(ish) access to the Canadian labour market, some      of them will be considered a job offer for immigration purposes, others      won\u2019t be.\n* Some of these      pathways depend on your nationality, others cater to specific occupations.      \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Working       Holiday \u2013 easy, but only for certain nationalities.\n* Global Talent       Stream \u2013 certain occupations.\n* Intra-Company       Transfer \u2013 self-explanatory.\n* [International       agreements](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/temporary-residents\/foreign-workers\/exemption-codes.html#r204) (usually based on your country of       nationality).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* You may also      have an easier time getting a work permit as [a      French speaker](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/temporary-residents\/foreign-workers\/exemption-codes\/canadian-interests-significant-benefit-mobilite-francophone-r205-exemption-code-c16.html).

However,      your employer must be really motivated and willing to invest time and      money in supporting your application.\n* You can also      work once you graduate from [some study      programs in Canada](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/temporary-residents\/study-permits\/post-graduation-work-permit-program\/eligibility.html) for up to 3 years. \n\n**Provinces\/Organizations that recruit foreign workers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Saskatchewan      is [looking      for healthcare professionals](https:\/\/www.saskatchewan.ca\/residents\/moving-to-saskatchewan\/live-in-saskatchewan\/by-immigrating\/saskatchewan-immigrant-nominee-program\/browse-sinp-programs\/applicants-international-skilled-workers\/international-healthcare-worker-eoi-pool).\n* New Brunswick      usually [recruits      tradespersons](https:\/\/www.welcomenb.ca\/content\/wel-bien\/en\/recruitment_events.html) as well as [healthcare      and IT professionals](https:\/\/talentgnb.ca\/).\n* French-speaking      candidates should keep an eye out for [Destination Canada](https:\/\/destinationcanada2021.vfairs.com\/).\n* BC is looking      for [healthcare      professionals](https:\/\/www.healthmatchbc.org\/?utm_source=web_redirect&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bchealthcarejobs_redirect).\n* Of course,      there are other recruiters out there.

Even if one is      \u201csuccessful\u201d in tricking the system, it can and likely will come back and      ruin your life years down the line, so be careful. \n\n**Worker to PR: Does Canadian Work Experience lead to Permanent Residence?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It certainly      helps, but there are no guarantees.\n* You must study      Federal (Express Entry) and Provincial Programs (of the province where you      will be working) and determine what kind of work experience you need to      immigrate, i.e. hours, occupation, wage, etc. You might also want to be      strategic and target a specific province\/community to increase your      chances of subsequent immigration.\n* Here\u2019s an      example. You come to Canada on a Working Holiday Work Permit, get 1 year      of skilled work experience, and immigrate under Express Entry Canadian      Experience Class. Sounds simple, doesn\u2019t it? However, if you choose the      wrong type of job (e.g. low skilled), get laid off, or work part-time \u2014 you      may be no closer to PR than before you came to Canada.\n\n**Student to PR: Does Studying in Canada lead to Permanent Residence?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Same story. It      helps, but you can easily mess it up if you don\u2019t do research. Only      certain types of study programs will benefit you in terms of future      immigration and your ability to work after graduation. So, plan ahead      BEFORE you get your letter of admission.\n* Usually, there      are more options for people who graduate from longer programs (at least 2      years), or Master\u2019s\/PhDr, and programs that [allow you to      work later on](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/temporary-residents\/study-permits\/post-graduation-work-permit-program\/eligibility.html). However, every province has different      criteria, and remember that it\u2019s about how competitive you are as a      candidate, not meeting minimum requirements. \n* If Federal      Pathway is a no-go, check out provincial immigration pathways for the      province\/community where you studied\/worked, and see what they\u2019re looking      for.\n* Be aware that      getting accepted into a study program is only a small step towards      success. Getting a study permit can be twice as hard. You need to be      strategic about your choice of program, whether you can afford the      studies, and whether you look like a genuine student or someone who\u2019s      trying to get into Canada by any means possible.\n\n**Common problems that I see among students coming to Canada:**\n\n\u00b7 Not being compliant: working without authorization, working more hours than you\u2019re supposed to.\n\n\u00b7 Ruining your eligibility for a work permit by studying part-time or missing key deadlines.\n\n\u00b7 Selecting a program that won\u2019t actually improve your chances of getting PR.\n\n\u00b7 No prior education and work experience. E.g. an 18-year-old comes, completes a 1-2 year certificate, they struggle to get a job due to lack of experience. Then 20-50k and several years later they cannot get PR. Don\u2019t be like that, do research. \n\n\u00b7 Alternatively, if you over rely on one immigration pathway and it changes, you might find yourself scrambling and your work permit running out. \n\n\u00b7 Thinking a visa is a guarantee. If you have 1) low funds, 2) insignificant ties to your home country, 2) temporary status in the country where you live, 3) previous refusals or violations, 4) a study plan that makes no sense career-wise, 5) a similar degree from home, 6) you already have the qualifications you\u2019re trying to obtain, 7) your entire family is coming with you, 8) you have a lot of family in Canada, 9) no previous travel \u2013 all these are common factors that can be viewed negatively by processing officers. They won\u2019t necessarily make or break the application, but it\u2019s something to be aware of when applying. \n\n**Can coming to Canada as a visitor lead to PR?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There\u2019s no      direct pathway, and all indirect pathways are very lengthy, expensive, and      basically require you to change status to worker or student (unless you      partner is a Canadian and they sponsor you).\n* You cannot      work as a visitor, and you can only study a short-term course (less than 6      months in TOTAL duration). You might also have to leave Canada in order to      change your immigration status from visitor to something else (in some      cases).\n\n**Visitor \u2013 Student \u2013 Worker \u2013 PR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Visitor to      Student to Worker is one of the ways you can come to Canada as a visitor      and later become a permanent residence.\n* Visitors can      take short-term courses of studies that are under 6 months. This includes      pre-requisite language courses that are required to enrol into some study      programs. If you finish a pre-requisite course, you may be able to apply      for a study permit without leaving Canada.\n* Certain      programs of studies can help you either get a work permit later or become      eligible for certain immigration pathways right after graduation.\n* You must be      careful and research what immigration pathway you will be eligible for      after studying in Canada, and whether your program of studies will allow      you meet those goals.\n\n**Something Else**\n\nThere are also a few pathways that can help you come to Canada, work, and\/or immigrate. Make sure to verify whether these pathways are open for receiving new applications and thoroughly research them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Self-Employed      Person\u2019s Class](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/permanent-residence\/economic-classes\/self-employed-persons.html) \u2014 the name is deceiving, this is      actually a pathway for professional athletes, artists, and self-employed      individuals in these fields. It has very narrow eligibility requirements,      high financial requirements, and pretty long processing times.\n* Pathways      for [Caregivers](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/permanent-residence\/economic-classes\/pathways-for-caregivers.html) & [Agri-Food      Pilo](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/agri-food-pilot\/about.html)t. These pathways have existed for a      while and they have undergone major changes. Some of those changes stem      from the fact that these programs used to be run by predatory recruiters      and exploitative employers. Is that still the case? I\u2019m not so sure. Also,      caregivers have a brutally small quote that filled up in a matter of hours      this year, so\u2026.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Plan your      immigration with 1-2 backup plans in mind. Immigration programs change,      pause, things don\u2019t go as planned all the time.\n* Don\u2019t start      your job\/school search without understanding how it would help you      immigrate (if immigration is your goal). Otherwise, by the time you      realize you enrolled in the wrong program, you could be down 20k and 2      years.\n* Understand      that unexpected things happen. You may not find a job right fter      graduating, you may not get invited for a PNP even though you\u2019re a perfect      candidate. Leave some room for error and have a contingency plan.\n\n**Admissibility**\n\nWhatever your plans are, they could be ruined if you, your spouse, or your children have had run-ins with the law (even the minor ones), or serious medical issues. The good news is, [being inadmissible to Canada](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/inadmissibility.html) is something that you may be able to overcome.\n\nIf you suspect you may be inadmissible and Immigration don\u2019t know (e.g. you already have a visa but something happened after), better address it with a professional before you try to travel to Canada or apply for a visa.\n\nThis applies to bogus criminal matters as well (some of us come from places where made up charges happen), don\u2019t count on border services being aware of your country\u2019s situation. Their priority is the safety of Canadians.\n\nWorst case \u2013 you might have to spend a couple of nights in jail while they investigate. Best case (if found out), you will be allowed to leave Canada right away.\n\n**A Few Words on Fraud and Misrepresentation**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Unfortunately,      there is an ocean full of fraudsters, preying on people who are desperate      to get a Canadian employer, get a perfect English score, or just move to      Canada one way or the other.\n* While those      offers may seem attractive, or, in some cases, they may seem like the only      option, I strongly advise against accepting them.\n* Canadian      immigration is ruthless towards applicants who misrepresent information in      their applications, and the penalties are quite severe. It won\u2019t matter      whether you knew that what you were doing was wrong, if everyone else was      doing it and you were the only one to get caught, or if it was done      without your knowledge. You will be the one paying the price.\n* [Learn      more](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/protect-fraud.html) about immigration fraud and don\u2019t      believe any guarantees or promises that are too good to be true.\n\n**What to do if you\u2019re already in the process and encountering some issues? I.e. this is when most people contact a professional** \n\n\u00b7 **Delays:**\n\n\\- How do I know if my application is delayed:\n\nLook up average processing times. If your application is within those, it might not be time to panic yet. \n\nIf you received multiple document requests or your application is complicated, it may take longer. \n\nAll kinds of forums and groups (Reddit, Facebook) exist where you can get an idea of when to expect updates. They\u2019re helpful because if you see 90% of people get an update in 2 months and it\u2019s been 6 months for you, you should do something. On the other hand, there will always be people whose application is processed faster than yours, there are people giving out questionable advice, and in general, obsessing over your application is a great way to derail your mental health. \n\nSo, use your discretion and prepare to wait longer than you would like to.\n\n\\- Don\u2019t call IRCC every day and send webforms every week. Being overly proactive like this could be harmful to you in the long run. \n\n\\- MP \u2013 if you\u2019re in Canada you can contact your Member of Parliament and ask them to follow up for you. I wouldn\u2019t do it unless the application is severely delayed, or you have some compelling circumstanced that make this delay a real problem in your life. \n\n\\- Mandamus \u2013 if it\u2019s been really long, find a lawyer and discuss this option. This is a way to \u201cforce\u201d the government to make a decision when the delay is unreasonably long (and there are a bunch of other considerations).\n\n\\- Webform & Call Center \u2013 again, be reasonable. If your application is delayed or if you just want to feel better and be sure that everything is going well, you can use these options (easily googleable). The Call center can be reached using Skype (paid) subscriptions, but they cannot advise on some applications that are being processed outside Canada.\n\n\u00b7 **Refusals:**\n\n\\- Application for[ Leave and for Judicial review](https:\/\/www.fct-cf.gc.ca\/en\/pages\/representing-yourself\/practice-guides\/how-to-file-an-application-for-leave-and-for-judicial-review-immigration): while you need a lawyer to challenge a refusal this way, it\u2019s a great option if you feel that you submitted a strong application and the refusal was overly generic or didn\u2019t make sense. E.g. visitor visa refused due to family ties in Canada, but you don\u2019t have family in Canada. Keep in mind that the deadline is 15 days for in-Canada matters, and 60 days for outside Canada matters. \n\n\\- Reapplication: if you didn\u2019t submit a strong application from the start, your circumstances since the last time you applied, or you simply missed the deadline to file for Leave and for Judicial review \u2013 this is an option. Make sure you address previous reasons for refusal. \n\n\\- ATIP\/GCMS notes: if you get refused or if you have a long and complex immigration history in Canada, always order these before you submit a new application (especially after a refusal). These notes will give you a bit of an insight into why you were refused, as opposed to the generic refusal letter. Anyone in Canada can apply, you can get it for IRCC and for CBSA, and it costs $5.\n\n\u00b7 **Violating various conditions of your status** \u2013 speak to a consultant\/lawyer as early as you can. Sometimes, those can be easily overcome if addressed in time. \n\n\u00b7 **Procedural fairness letter** \n\n\\- If immigration suspect that something\u2019s not adding up, they will provide you with an opportunity to explain yourself before they refuse you (or worse). \n\n\\- This is your chance to make things right, and while I\u2019m not saying that you cannot do it yourself, I wouldn\u2019t advise you to. A response to a PFL is no a simple 1-paragraph explanation, it\u2019s usually when you build an argument with a bunch of proof.\n\n\u00b7 You worked with an [unauthorized representative ](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigration-citizenship-representative\/learn-about-representatives.html)before \u2013 yikes. Unfortunately this is common, but it\u2019s still illegal and it could get you in trouble. Not knowing who is authorized to charge for immigration support is no excuse. Don\u2019t do it again!\n\nHowever, if you did it on a previous application, get ATIP\/GCMS notes before you proceed just to make sure they didn\u2019t mess things up too much. \n\n\u00b7 Where to look for information if you\u2019re DIYing:\n\n\\- [IRCC website](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html)\n\n\\- [Processing Manuals](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals.html)\n\n\\- Ask your authorized representative (but make sure they\u2019re licensed first).\n\nThat\u2019s all, friends. This doesn\u2019t cover 1% of all things immigration, but I hope it can help you better understand how Canadian immigration works and where to look for information. \n\nAnd if you have any questions about family sponsorship, refugee, or humanitarian & compassionate options, please ask away!","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676053027.0},{"title":"[WeWantOut] 25M and 25F from Brazil -> Europe","author":"itsmelucasmarquezin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/10zwmhy\/wewantout_25m_and_25f_from_brazil_europe\/","text":"Hello all.\n\nWe are a couple from Sao Paulo, Brazil, and we want to leave Brazil for a couple of reasons, but mostly due to safety, lack of opportunities here and we want to be somewhere safer to raise kids someday.\n\nWe are mostly thinking of somewhere in Europe, but we are open to suggestions.\n\nI'll provide some basic background here:\n\nMe (25M) - I'm a lab technician.

Let's say I'm not a big fan of russian government lol). I've left my job, switched to swift programming. We have sold part of our property and left to Armenia at the end of 2022.\n\nHere we are now, 1.5 months later, still in Yerevan. I'm still learning swift and planning to start doing interviews next month (which is going to be pretty challenging, since there's no real need for juniors on CIS market). Wife's working remotely on several projects, but that doesn't bring much, so we're slowly burning our property money. We want to move to a decent english-speaking country which is not going to fall apart in a few years. US and Canada are first routes which come to mind. I was consulted by several immigration lawyers in US and Canada, also did some digging regarding other options and here are my thoughts:\u00a0\n\n1. USA. The only option to come here in our case is asking for an asylum, since we're no millionaires and don't have an awesome job experience for eb-1a. I have a sister living in Miami (she's been citizen for well over 20 years) but that won't help much, tier 4 reunion cases are being approved after 15 years or something like that. My friend is currently waiting for his interview on us-mexican border, but he got pretty severe case of political persecution with a risk of going to jail, having videos of him being threatened etc. Me and my wife both participated in anti-Putins rallies but never got arrested or something like that. Worst thing that happened was police getting to my wife's home and scaring her in order not to support Navalny (no force were used though and we don't have footage). I'm afraid our case is not strong enough and we'll get deported after consideration. Also, as far as I understand, refugees don't get work permit immediately, so our options is either working illegally on some shitty jobs for cash or spend property money :(\u00a0\n2. Canada. This option seems less extreme. Express entry and other federal programs are probably out of our reach but my wife can get an education visa to learn and work part-time and I'll be able to come with her as a spouse. We'll be able to move in august-september and start process of integration with more or less clear way to get PR after. On the other hand, I'm not sure how well can we perform on the IT jobs market there, but that question is probably applicable to other cases aswell :)\n3. South America. We can get to Argentina\/Chili\/Brazil\/Uruguay, find remote jobs there and live on low budget until better option reveals itself. Cons: life is hard already, I don't want to learn another language in a hurry while not planning to tie my life with these countries\u00a0\n4. EU. I'm not a fan of EU in general, neither economically, nor politically. While there are some options available I'd rather seek elsewhere.\n5. GB. No idea on how to get here. Maybe someone can share some knowledge?\n6. Australia\/NZ. 100% of fauna trying to kill you sounds metal af and lotr landscapes are awesome, otherwise no idea\n\nThat's pretty much it.

I have an undergraduate humanities degree and a postgraduate qualification in Guidance. I've worked in a range of guidance-based roles in colleges, universities and charities, and I have a lot of experience of supporting young people and adults with a range of disabilities.\n\nI'm now at the stage where I feel like I really need to travel and broaden my horizons.

I'd be happy to branch out into other related fields, such as HR, but I'm unsure how interested employers would be without direct experience in this area. \n\nI feel like there's potentially a lot of roles in education (guidance and support rather than teaching) or possibly local government that I could look into, but it all feels a bit vague and it doesn't feel like there's a clearly defined path.

Ideally I'm looking for countries with a decent standard of healthcare that are relatively safe for women (but I know safety can't be guaranteed anywhere). \n\nIf anyone has any pointers, or any stories of how they've got jobs abroad working in non-STEM fields, I'd be really interested.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1676024951.0},{"title":"[IwantOut] 31M Indian UAE->Ireland\/EU","author":"neocryptex","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/10zetaw\/iwantout_31m_indian_uaeirelandeu\/","text":"I'm a 31 yr old IT Systems Engineer and administrator with 7 yes of experience.

I've contemplated the idea of moving outside of the country before, but let's just say that a major incident in regards to my health is making me seriously considering emigration once I've graduated.\n\nMy first choice in where I want to move is Canada, mainly because of their socialized medical services, and that it's very culturally close to the United States. However, I also want to live somewhere that isn't car dependent, and the cities that seem to crop in my research is Toronto and Montreal.\n\nMontreal sounds like a very ideal place for me, mainly because from the way people have been describing it, it's framework for what a well designed city should look like. Aside from that, it seems to have a very rich and unique culture, on top of that, it being a billingual city and very affordable is an added bonus. However, I know for a fact that my biggest hurdle will be having to learn French (which I'm terrible at), dealing with the cold winters, and I heard their healthcare coverage isn't the best.\n\nMy second choice would be Toronto, as it seems to be a place that I can get around without a car, plus being more familiar as an Anglophonic city. But my main problem is that the rent prices are ridiculously expensive, on top of a lot of job listings I saw underpaying graphic designers.\n\nI will also consider any other city in Canada as long as it isn't car dependent and the public transportation is good.\n\nLast resort is France just for the fact that if I'm seriously considering moving to Quebec, I might as well consider that country as well, but that's under the assumption that I can find an English-speaking graphic design job.\n\nSo with that being said, here's some stuff I want to know:  \n1.) What is the likelyhood of me landing a job in these countries as a yet-to-be-resident?  \n2.) How is the immigration process to these countries?  \n3.) How are health services?  \n4.) Is there a chance of me getting a grahic design job in Montreal as an English-speaker? (I saw some listings)  \n5.) Are there any immersion programs in Montreal (and France) to help me learn French faster?  \n6.) Neighborhoods you'd recommend living in  \n7.) Any other pros and cons that I should know about  \n8.)

It would also be great to have a more progressive community. Walkable\/bikeable towns with rugged mountains & lush forests nearby would be incredible. I think my top picks would be Germany or Switzerland, just like everyone else, but beggars can't choose and just not being in the US anymore is my main concern, so I'd consider lots of other places, even outside the EU.\n\nI have a Bachelor of Biology degree. Most of my classes had been focused on human health or biochemistry. I worked as an EMT for a few years after college with plans to go to medical school or physician's assistant school but decided that the medical field in the US doesn't appeal to me. Although I'm sure it'd be more satisfying elsewhere, I no longer expect to enjoy work in the medical field in another country either, but I haven't completely ruled it out.

My current job is as a utility forester for my local electric company, which has some very minor environmental\/wildlife survey responsibilities but is mostly focused on tree assessment. I'm an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), which, like the International House of Pancakes (IHOP), I think isn't actually widely appreciated outside the US.\n\nI would love to return to school for a graduate degree, which seems like it'll be a necessity to help me move career in my desired direction anyway, and I would love to do so in EU.

I would very much hope to be able to leverage such an opportunity for a permanent stay; is that a normal thing??\n\nI'd just as soon move for a job as for school.

Im already taking german lessons and will definitely reach atleast C1 if i continue doing so throughout university. Will not studying in Germany be a huge disadvantage? Id much rather study in english than german.\n\nHello! Ive already made a post here but some things have changed so im here again!\n\nIm trying to figure out what immigration routes i can take right out of university. Im currently in high school, so i still have the ability to pick what career\/degree to pursue, where to study, etc etc. and im trying to make the most out of it\n\nI absolutely love nuclear power, electrical engineering, energy physics, nuclear physics, and chemistry. Im currently planning on studying electrical engineering in Australia, getting a masters (and specialising) in sustainable energy engineering, and hopefully working in the energy sector. Energy engineers aren\u2019t all that common from what ive seen, and tend to have a good shot at immigrating due to the demand but id just like to see if the demand is good enough that it\u2019d warrant a future residence visa. \n\nAustralian immigration is quite tough from what I\u2019ve heard, its the best country for me but i understand i have to fit the current job demands, so im quite conflicted. Im also considering germany, id much rather study in an english speaking country but im capable of studying german if i have to.\n\nAnyway, is my current plan decent? What countries would you recommend i consider? And what immigration routes can i take for an Australian residence visa? I know i have to find a job in australia to be able to stay, would you say i realistically could? I really just want a progressive country with workers rights, the ability to get a citizenship after a few years, and LGBTQ Rights. My sudanese citizenship isnt doing me any favours.\n\nEdit: my parents are willing to pitch in up to 50k AUD for my studies, and im currently planning on studying in UNSW Sydney. I do freelance video editing, which makes me enough to cover any extra living expenses.\n\nThanks all!","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1675045036.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 19M Iran -> Germany\/Sweden\/EU","author":"IronFisttt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/10oyrfm\/iwantout_19m_iran_germanyswedeneu\/","text":"Hello everyone, \n\nI'm firm on immigrating out of this country, for a plethora of reasons you might already know or not. I'm LGBT, there is possibly no bright future here, economical crisis, and many more social and cultural reasons. \n\n\nI just wanted to seek advice for few things here. There's a lack of sufficient higher education institutions here. So we have a fierce and competitive examination for getting into college, they call it [Konkour](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iranian_University_Entrance_Exam#:~:text=The%20Iranian%20University%20Entrance%20Exam,all%20of%20them%20called%20Konkour.).\n\n\nMeanwhile I have been job searching for remote positions since I'm proficient in English, the only skill I currently possess. Was called for an interview from an start-up e-commerce business as they needed English translators. I went in their office for an interview and from their advertisement I was supposed to be able to work remotely after getting appointed with the job for 1 month. But they told me they no longer need remote translators. And this was a 9-5 position, with 3 hours of commute in total daily. \n\nTheir workplace seemed prestigious and the initial pay wasn't great, minimum wage at best. But I know this could help out build a resume for me besides saving up a bit and maybe I could be able to network for bigger opportunities. \n\nThe issue here is, if I were to work I'd have to let go of the Konkour exam and the chance of being in state funded colleges here, there would be no time to catch up. Even though it's not that expensive, I may not go in good enough colleges, possible to not even be able to major in the field I like (computer science) but that's a guess. \n\n\nI'm actively researching about the country and the method I wish to immigrate. I thought my best bet is being an student for a master's degree in Europe, possibly Germany (because there are no tuition fees for international studey). Save up, gain work experience and learn more skills. \n\nI will need +2 years of work experience as I need to save up for the ~12k \u20ac each year in the German block account. Although I'm not relying on it, Sweden and Germany seem to require 2 years of work experience and bachelor's for international scholarship and I could shoot my shot after reaching there. \nMost likely I'll have to invest in something and can't do it with working alone as our currency isn't worth much to euros. \n\nI would think about getting a work permit but.. I think that requires much more than a bachelor's and 2 years of work. Especially in Sweden. (Should I think about taking steps towards a work permit instead?)\n\nSo this is what I'm here for and I am asking for advice on what to stick with for now. \n\nAnd if there are any other European countries with easier immigration policies and cheaper for me to look into I'd love to know more about It as my knowledge isn't full on every EU country. \n\nMy plans aren't yet solidified. I know immigration is absolutely no easy feat and I'm very far from it. I'm just wondering which step gets me a tiny bit closer. I appreciate you reaching this far <3","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1675074685.0},{"title":"[IWantOut] 29M Peru -> United states","author":"DarkLoLNT","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IWantOut\/comments\/10p7reb\/iwantout_29m_peru_united_states\/","text":"Hello, I have an odd situation and need help.\n\nI was born in Miami , Florida . and later moved to Atlanta georgia where i lived until i was 14 years old.
