        "text": " \n\nWhen we were kids, most of us always did something that would be considered \"wrong\" whether it was pushing your sibling off of their bike, throwing rocks at your friends on the playground, or maybe it was cheating on your math test. The point is, we all made mistakes, and I was no exception. I’ve hit kids with sticks, I’ve tripped my friends on purpose, I’ve even chipped my little brother’s tooth with a basketball at one point, but it’s not my fault. I never acted like that unless there was a reason for me to initiate that response. For example my little brother David, blamed me for not taking out the trash when it was his turn to do it, that is why I chipped his tooth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to last year. Me and my brother, who was 10 at the time, were sitting on the couch after school on a Friday. Our mom and dad walked into the living room and told us that they were going to go out for the evening and instructed me to watch over David and left us $20 for pizza if we got hungry. Being the 16 year old that I was, I obviously pocketed the change and began to text my friends to see if they would like to meet up at the local fast food joint and hang out. That’s when David suddenly gasped. I looked up from my phone to see David with the biggest grin I’ve ever seen on anybody’s face. “What?” I said, confused. “I have an idea!” David yelled. “What is it?”. David stood up and was practically dancing his way over to me as he said “Let’s go to that new restaurant in town!”. “Ziggy’s?” I replied. “Yeah!!” David yelled even louder. “Yeah nice try, that place looks like it is for 7 year olds.” “Oh pleaseeee” David cried. “What is your problem kid, mom took you there like last week, I want to go hangout with my friends.” David began to get emotional as he said one last time “Please.” “Jesus Christ David, fine. I’ll take you to Zippy’s or whatever the hell it’s called.” We climbed in my car and made our way to the restaurant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we finally arrived at Ziggy’s it began to rain outside. “Strange” I thought to myself “It wasn’t even supposed to be cloudy today, let alone rain.” David and I walked into the restaurant and as soon as I opened the doors,  the foul odor of children, boogers, and cheap pizza hit me straight in the face. “Well that's appealing” I said sarcastically under my breath, David didn’t seem to mind though. His face lit up with joy as he sprinted inside. “David wait up” I called but he didn’t listen. He ran straight over to the little ball pit they had towards the back of the store and jumped in like he was an olympic diver. Ziggy’s was a strange place, It was sort of a fast food restaurant where you went up to the counter to order your food, then you would go sit down at one of the many tables while your kids could go play in the ball pit, or the big jungle gym type thing they had, or they could sit with you and be amused by the big walking mascots they had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n There were 3 mascots at Ziggy’s. Lancey, who was this guy dressed in a big yellow rabbit costume. Missy, who was a lady dressed in a big white dog costume. And of course Ziggy who was a big stupid looking animatronic white chicken that stood on top of the stage. All Ziggy would do is stand on stage and ‘sing’ dumb made up songs, while encouraging the people to go and order more chicken and pizza. I immediately sat down and put my head in my hands. ‘What am I doing here? How did I let David convince me to come here? I should just leave David here and go hang out with my friends.” I thought to myself when suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey buddy, are you doing alright?” I look up to see Missy, the white dog mascot looking at me. “Yeah I’m doing fine, thanks.” “Can I get you anything?” she replied. “No I’m fine snoopy, thanks.” with extra emphasis on the “thanks”. She walked away without saying another word and I sat there in silence. Then suddenly there were two hands slamming onto the table. It startled the hell out of me and I looked up, it was David and he looked awful. “What is the matter with you?” He sat there panting like a dog. “Water…Drink…Thirsty..Help.” “Goddamn kid, here, sit down. I’ll go order our food, what do you want?”. He sat there for a moment still panting then only replied with “Chicken strips”. “Man” I thought “What the hell is going on inside of those jungle gyms?” I walked up to the counter to order my food. Some lady who looked to be in her late 20’s was working the register. “Hi, welcome to Ziggy’s, what can I get you?” “Yeah can I get a number 4 with a Coke and can I also get a number 2 with a diet coke please?.” “Will that be all?” “Yep” I replied “That’ll be $14.62” “What the fuck?” I thought to myself “$14.62 for some frozen chicken strips and a hamburger they probably threw in the microwave? That is outrageous.” I paid for my food and sat down while they made my order. David was nowhere to be seen. “That's weird, he looked like he was about to keel over a minute ago, and now he’s gone… He must really love that jungle gym.” I muttered to myself while giving a slight chuckle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I sat there for the next 10 minutes waiting for my food, and in that time the restaurant began to clear out slowly. I didn’t blame them, there’s not much to this place. As I sat there growing impatient, I finally heard them calling out for my order. “About time.” I said. I went and grabbed my food then sat down and waited for David. “Where is he? He’s been gone for probably 15 to 20 minutes.” I thought... It was getting late, it was almost 7:30 and there was still no sight of David. Employees were cleaning tables, The people in the kitchen were washing their dishes for the night and there was still no David, Where could he have been? I began to get impatient with him. “It has been over an hour since I’ve seen him and he still hasn’t come back?” I finally decided to say “screw it, I’m gonna go find this kid.” As I began my walk to the jungle gym/ ball pit area I was thinking “David really made me drive all the way over here and spend $15 dollars on food that he isn’t gonna eat, and waste my time?” I wasn’t having it. When I found David I was going to drag him by his collar out of the restaurant and bring him home, I didn’t care how much fun he was having. After all, it’s not like it’s my fault. He was the one that wanted to waste my time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I began my search for him in the tunnels of this jungle gym. If you are familiar with the ones they have at some McDonald’s or Burger King, you would know that they usually have lots of tunnels for kids to crawl through, lots of slides and nets for the kids to play in. The one here at Ziggy’s was similar to those but much larger. As I was crawling through this massive structure shouting for David I went through a tunnel that had one of those clear windows that kids could use to look out into the restaurant, as I passed by I caught a glimpse of something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was David. He was standing out in the party area talking to Lancey the big rabbit. “Oh you have to be shitting me.” I said. I quickly exited the structure, completely blinded by rage and I began shouting “David where the fu-” and then I stopped. There was nothing. There was nobody. There was not a single soul in the restaurant, besides me. “Where did everyone go? I was only in there for 5 minutes max, you mean to tell me everybody left within that time?” I was absolutely stunned. I went to find an employee to help me in my search for my little brother but there was genuinely nobody in this restaurant. I began to get worried, I thought to myself “What if something happened to him? Did someone take him? How do I explain this to my mom? She can’t be mad at me though, after all it’s not my fault.” and then it hit me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Outside. David is outside, he has to be. Maybe he saw all the employees closing for the night and he went outside to wait for me, as to not be in their way. I briskly walked outside to see...Nothing. There was nobody out there. My car was the only car in the entire parking lot. At this point it was pouring outside, there was no way David could be out here standing in the rain. I began to head back inside to continue my search for him, but the door was locked. It had locked itself behind me. “Shit” I said, I began banging on the doors to get David’s attention if he was in there but he wasn’t. I didn’t know what to do. I decided I would try the back door, that would’ve been my only other way in. I ran around the building and got to the back door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Luckily for me they were unlocked. I walked back into the restaurant and began to call for David…No response. I walked to the stage in the restaurant and sat down on it, Next to the big animatronic Ziggy who was frozen in his current position. I assume he was turned off while I was in the jungle gym. As I sat there, clueless as to what to do next, it hit me. “The bathroom. Holy shit how could I be this stupid, David is probably in the bathroom!”I ran down the hallway and entered the bathroom and I called out “David? Are you here?” No response. I looked beneath the stalls and saw it. David’s shoes. I went over to his stall to knock on the door, when I knocked, it opened. His stall door opened to reveal his shoes. Just his shoes. No David. At this moment I heard a laugh from the next stall over. It wasn’t David’s laugh. It sounded like an older man who had gone insane. It was the most disturbed laugh I could ever imagine. As soon as I heard it I bolted out of the bathroom. I flung open the bathroom door, and at that moment I heard the man’s stall door fling open and hit the bathroom wall. I ran so fast out of the restaurant without a second thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I sprinted through the rain and ran to my car, quickly hopped inside and started the car. I sat there for a moment to see what would happen. Nothing. Nobody came through the doors chasing me, David didn’t come outside laughing hysterically because he just pranked me, there was nothing. Until I saw it. On the right side of the building there he was. Lancey, the big rabbit. Peeking from around the corner, holding something. It was a hand. David’s hand. He was holding it in such a way that made it look like the rest of the arm was behind the wall. I felt a moment of relief. “David is okay” I thought, and then he showed me the rest of it. He began to reveal the rest of the hand, then the wrist, then the elbow, then the shoulder and then it stopped. There was nothing connected to the shoulder. I then realized I was looking at David’s severed arm. I immediately threw the car into reverse and peeled out of there. I called the police on the drive home and told them what I had seen. Then I called my parents. They thought it was a sick joke, until they got home that night and saw cop cars parked at our house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n They confirmed to us that David had been murdered at Ziggy’s. He was found “Torn to pieces” in the stall next to the one I had found his shoes in. Ziggy’s was permanently shut down after the incident and an immediate investigation was opened to find David’s killer. He was never found. My parents asked me everyday after the event “Why did you take him there?”, “Why weren’t you watching him closer?” ‘Why did you let this happen?” and I would always reply with “It’s not my fault.” and that's because it’s not my fault...Right?",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my time in the Marine Corps was up, I didn't know what to do with myself. Reenlisting wasn't appealing, but I had gone into the Corps fresh out of high school. I had heard about a handful of guys I knew going to help the YPG in their fight against ISIS,Turkey, and more to reclaim their homes. For some reason, I felt that I needed to help the Kurds. Maybe it was because we abandoned them to fight for themselves, but two weeks after returning from the USMC, I researched how to join, and just a week later, I was getting ready to board a flight to the Middle East. A buddy of mine, Colt, was already there and some nice pieces of kit waiting for me, including a rifle he pulled off a dead ISIS fighter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI arrived in Germany, and took a few small flights, which had me close to Syria. I wasn't sure where I was, but \"Reno\", a Mexican volunteer met me at the airport I was at, and drove us for a while, until we arrived at a small hut, accustomed to what you'd see small farmers living in in places such as Afghanistan. From there, we walked a few kilometers up the steep hillsides nearby until we reached a small opening in the mountain covered by cloth. He gestured for me to enter, and I did. I looked around at the lanterns hanging from the walls and ceiling, and a few troops with plate carriers and rifles, standing around the light. The atmosphere was relaxed for the situation we were in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of ISIS and other insurgent groups, Turkish jets and drones dropped ordnance on the hillsides where they knew we were. Just as Reno introduced me to some members of our unit, the mountain shook with the sound of an explosion, and dust fell from the cave ceiling. The group laughed, as I stood there anxiously waiting for another. Another explosion rocked the surrounding area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Don't worry Yankee, it's the bomb you don't hear that kills you.\" Spoke \"Chez\", a Kurdish fighter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew this of course from my time in the marines, but never once was I the intended target of an airstrike. It was a humbling experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nColt walked into the clearing in the center of the room, with two Ak-47's, and threw one to me, which I barely caught. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Know how to shoot you sorry son of a bitch?\" He said, cracking a grin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't seen him since he left the Marines two years ago, so I was excited to see my former battle buddy again. I felt at home again, which I hadn't felt in a while. The men I served with were a mix of Kurds, former western troops, and a few crazy civilians from western countries. It was implied that members from the international scene must at least have some military training, but the group did their best to teach those that had little to no combat experience or training. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur sleeping quarters were just small areas of the cave where we put mats down, and slept in our sleeping bags on top of the mats. We all used radios to communicate with each other and other units of the YPG. Occasionally you'd hear frantic screaming and gunfire, but that was the life we had here. I felt the camaraderie quickly, and the other members treated me like an old friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following day, I went on a patrol with a Reno, Colt, and other members of the unit. There had been reports of a group of around 10 YPG guys getting wiped out in an instant. Reno had mentioned that snipers were a huge threat, so he and Colt figured that the group must have been ambushed by a combination of snipers and machine gunners. It seemed obvious to assume, but there was so much unknown that it helped to have some semblance of understanding of what was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe slowly approached the are where the group went missing, a small cave entrance on a hillside overlooking the valley we patrolled, which was opposite to our cave system. Reno and Colt led, Chez stood just behind me. We moved very, very slowly, checking every possible area for snipers. We got closer and closer to the entrance, and no snipers shot at us. This was greatly unusual. Normally, at least one of us would have been killed by now if these snipers were still here. Of course, this sounds stupid, but we were eager to kill ISIS, and strangely enough, we gave up some rationality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon, we reached the entrance of the cave. Just as we did, a massive dog, which must have been 6 feet tall at least, and had a beautiful, gray and tan coat. We stood there, mesmerized, we didn't even draw our weapons. At this point, shit got weird. It turned around, walking into the cave. We followed. It was like we were hypnotized, we mindlessly followed it into the cave, walking by the blood stains, bullet impacts, and bones on the floor. We walked deeper and deeper into the cave, and a hand pulled me into a small space. I saw a Kurdish fighter holding his finger over my mouth, shushing me, with the lighting from the cave entrance barely illuminating his face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI watched the rest of the group follow the dog, and when I glanced at the fighter holding me still, his face contorted into a wicked smile, his eyelids seemed to disappear and his face became sunken, his teeth growing, gnashing at me. I pushed myself away from him, grasping my rifle. The others in the group seemed to be lucid again, startled by my cry's for help. The dog swiftly turned around, ripping Colt to pieces. The group shot at the dog while I dumped my rounds into the thing that had ahold of me. It let out an inhuman scream, and thundered down the cave, slashing one of our guys down as it did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lighting from the cave entrance gave us a direction to run. As I neared the entrance, the sound of rotary engines filled my ears. I recognized the sound of an AH-64 Apache Attack helicopter from my time in the marines. I felt good about it at the time, but looking back, I knew why we were there. The coalition Air Forces had contact with the YPG, and we'd call in air strikes for them to kill ISIS. Sometimes, we'd even do specific scouting missions for the coalition, we just wanted to kill ISIS so we obliged. It seems that the coalition thought something was off about this cave, because as I made my way out of the cave, it opened fire with its cannon. Dust and rock fragments were kicked into my face, causing me to slip back into the cave. Then, explosions rocked the areas, and I blacked out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI awoke, in complete darkness. I heard my buddies groaning underneath the rubble. I was lucky enough to come to my feet. I took a flashlight from my belt and clicked it on, revealing Chez and Reno to both be in pieces. A few more men were destroyed. There was one fighter, Milo as we called him, pinned halfway under the rubble. We begged for my help in broken English, and I  grabbed his shoulders, and pulled him. He stopped making noise, and I noticed that he was completely in half. He died right there. I found a rifle on the ground, and shouldered it, trying to figure out how to get out of there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wandered down the cave system, not seeing any trace of the dog or thing that grabbed me. I took every corner slowly. That was until, I heard yelling and growling behind me, obviously being that thing from earlier. Knowing that there was likely no exit, I ran. I heard it behind me, yelling more and more. As I made my way further into the cave, I noticed light around a corner. It was an exit. I sprinted to it, even throwing down my rifle to speed up. I jumped out into the light, rolling down the hill. I looked back, and watched it wicked face in a twisted grin, its jagged teeth and sunken eyes directed straight towards me. It screeched, and ran back into the cave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up and wandered around until I found a road, which I followed until I flagged down a car, which happened to be western YPG volunteers. Over the next few weeks, I made it back to the US, and was even interviewed by an agent from the CIA. I'm writing this from my home, but what happened that day will never leave my mind.",

        "text": "I’m not sure how much time I have left, so I need to try to get this out there. The sirens have stopped, but my gut tells me that’s not a good thing. The entrance nearest my post has been sealed and the internal phones are dead. I’m surprised that my personal cell phone still works, but since we’re strictly prohibited from carrying personal devices inside the facility, I’m thinking that they just haven’t gotten around to jamming those frequencies yet. It’s just a matter of time now, and it’s a question of what’s going to stop me first, so I’m going to post as much as I can while I’m still able.\n\nThe darkness is getting pretty close now.\n\nMy two-way radio isn’t receiving anything but a high-pitched tone, making it impossible for me to use it to reach anyone else. I’ve turned the damned thing off at this point; it was only serving to further rattle my already raw nerves. It’s not like I would expect an answer, anyway. I’m not even sure if anyone’s there to hear me, even if I could get it to work.\n\nI haven’t seen anyone since that checkpoint guard bought it, and that was almost half-an-hour ago. \n\nThat was bad. I’ll carry that image with me for the rest of my life, however long that may be.\n\nI’m getting ahead of myself, though. \n\nI need to start at the beginning, so you have some context, whoever “you” are. \n\nFor the record, my name is Jeremy Rickman, formerly Chief Petty Officer, US Navy, and more recently a private contractor serving as security for a research post in South Dakota. I always wondered why a government research facility would make use of private contractors, but I’m sure they had their reasons. There were always plenty of Air Force personnel in and out of here, so it’s not like the military wasn’t aware of it.\n\nAnyway, that’s not important. I started working here about a year ago, when a buddy I had shipped out with a few times reached out to me about a job opportunity. High-yield, low-effort type stuff. Since I had recently finished my final tour and gotten my discharge, I was mostly just bumping around, trying to find something to do next.\n\nA couple of phone conversations and cursory interviews later, I found myself on an unmarked C-130 transport, flying into Ellsworth Air Force Base, outside of Rapid City in the middle of the night. From there, I was taken in a windowless HUMVEE for a two-hour ride over rough roads and deposited outside the massive main entrance to the mountain facility, bored right into the rock itself. It was like something out of a movie, but when the pay was this good, I guess anything was on the table.\n\nThis has been my home ever since. The contract was for a twenty-four-month stint in this hole. There’s a small community they set up about ten miles away specifically for people who work here, and we’re restricted to these two places during our contract. \n\nNo visitors.\n\nNo field trips or weekend liberties.\n\nNo exceptions.\n\nOkay, so that’s out of the way. Let me tell you how we got here today.\n\nI started my shift earlier tonight at 2200 just like every night, relieving that uptight asshole, Williams. As it so happened, I was running a few minutes late, and he was pretty quick to give me an earful about responsibility and how he was considering reporting me to the “old man”. I barely listened, honestly – I was too focused on that shitty excuse for a mustache he’s been trying to grow for the last six months. You know the type – the same wispy shadow that’s equally at home on the upper lip of a pubescent high schooler or an Italian grandmother. \n\nOn a forty-year-old man, it’s laughable. \n\nYou’ve gotta know your limits, folks. If you can’t grow one, maybe it’s best to just go with the clean-shaven look instead. Can’t fight mother nature, right?\n\nShit, I’m getting off-topic again. Sorry, it’s been a chaotic night and I’m trying to calm my nerves. I tend to ramble and wander when I get stressed.\n\nSo, like I said, I relieved Williams at 2200. My nights are usually pretty quiet – most of the researchers are already gone for the day and the only folks I tend to encounter are either the mobile sentries making their rounds or the odd research supervisor burning the midnight oil.\n\nTonight, it was mostly the same for the first couple hours. The only exception that was noteworthy was when Dr. Weissman came through my checkpoint. He’s an older guy – retired Marine, I think – and he’s pleasant enough. We’ve stopped and shot the shit a few times. He always calls me ‘squiddy Rickman’ because of my Navy background, like it’s some sort of title, but he always does it with a friendly grin, so I never took it wrong.\n\nI’m not sure exactly what he does here, other than oversee one of the research teams working on some hush-hush project, but that’s not really different than anyone else, I guess. They don’t tend to tell us guards much of anything. It’s our job to make sure that only authorized personnel are granted entry – we don’t need to know anything else. \n\nIt’s probably better that way, honestly.\n\nAnyway, when he came through tonight, he was riding passenger in a covered transport with an Air Force driver at the wheel. The insignia on the driver’s shoulder marked him as a Master Sergeant, though he was wearing an air of self-importance that I thought was a little above his E-7 pay grade. He didn’t meet my eyes and kept his focus straight ahead, like this whole thing was nothing but an inconvenient interruption to him. \n\nAs far as Weissman was concerned, I could tell something was up with him – he didn’t have that same friendly demeaner this time. Something seemed to be weighing on him today, so I didn’t bother trying to be chatty.\n\nWhen I stepped out of my shack and reached the driver door, the driver handed me out an ID and manifest exception document without even bothering to utter a word. Dr Weissman gave me a curt nod and handed his own ID across as well.\n\nI scanned both IDs, which came back green, and took a quick look over the document to make sure it was in order, or at least appear that I was doing it. Manifest exceptions are essentially documents telling the security personnel that whatever is concealed in the cargo is classified and not subject to inspection. Basically, it tells me to piss off and mind my own business.\n\nBecause everything is so goddamned secretive up here, I don’t really have any way to confirm the validity of it and have to rely on my instinct and the ID of the person transporting it to determine whether it warrants radioing in for verification.\n\nIf it was anyone else, I’d probably have done just that, if for no other reason than to piss off the driver, but since I was pretty friendly with the Doc, I let them pass. Not sure if that had anything to do with what happened later, but it’s something that I’ve been turning over in my mind for the last hour or so. \n\nWondering if I brought this on myself.\n\nRegardless, I handed the IDs and documents back to the driver and entered my code on the keypad inside my shack, lowering the steel barricade and letting them pass. I raised a hand to wave to the Doc, but they took off without another glance in my direction, the roar of the diesel echoing in the hollow air of the tunnel as they traveled deeper into the facility.\n\nI went back inside my shack and sat down at the desk, picking up an old sci-fi novel I’d been lazily working my way through for a while and settling in for what I expected to be a quiet night.\n\nOver the next hour or so, a couple more folks passed through my checkpoint. One was Stevens, one of the mobile sentries making his rounds to all the checkpoints in his electric cart. We didn’t spend much time chatting tonight, since he was already running behind in his rounds, but exchanged a quick greeting and then parted company. The other was this pretty little redhead researcher named Ashley – Ash for short – that was leaving after a long day. We’d been flirting a little over the last few months, though I don’t think she was very serious about it, and I doubted anything would ever come of it, but a fella can still dream, right?\n\nBeyond that, I was alone in corridor 3-F, left to my own devices.\n\nUntil the radio squawked on my belt, that is.\n\n“*Burst message to all stations. Unauthorized personnel have breached the facility. The specimen storage has been broken into and live subjects have been released. Veterinary staff are working to recover them and return them to their habitats at this time. Intruders have not yet been found. Stay on alert and report any unusual occurrences. End message.*”\n\n*Intruders?* What the hell? \n\nFrom the sound of it, it was likely some of those animal-rights nutjobs that try to get in every once in a while, to liberate the animal test subjects. Hell, I wasn’t even sure that we *had* any animals in the facility until the burst message came through. Regardless, I’m surprised they actually made it inside – this place is a fortress.\n\nI don’t have anything against animals, personally. I like dogs. Cats can fuck right off, as far as I’m concerned, but I still wouldn’t want to see one hurt. I don’t like the thought of any of them being used for experimentation, at least on a philosophical level. When you apply that to the real world of medical research, though, the objections become harder to maintain. If a few animals have to be sacrificed to save a little baby from leukemia, the balance becomes pretty easy to justify to me.\n\nWhat I don’t understand is exactly what these animal-rights extremists expect to accomplish. Do they think that the military will just throw up their hands and let the animals go? Do they think that their actions are going to do anything other than get them thrown in a federal prison for a long, long time?\n\nAnd that’s if they don’t get shot – these facilities are all highly restricted areas. “Use of lethal force authorized” warning signs litter the area outside the facility, and they’re not fucking around about it. When I took the job, I was issued an M-4 carbine and an M-18 sidearm, with the explicit ROE to stop intruders using any means necessary. I hoped I would never have to use either one, but if I do, it’d be because some asshole criminal forced me to do it, not because I want to.\n\nSo, when the burst announcement crackled through my radio, I stepped outside my shack and looked up and down the massive corridor. It was probably thirty feet high and fifty feet across, the smooth rock ceiling dotted with high-lumen lights that lit up the paved floor of the tunnel with a yellowish glow. The entrance to the tunnel was a hundred yards from where I stood, brightly lit and manned by a couple of guards whose job it was to maintain an awareness of anyone approaching the facility. Beyond the mouth of the tunnel was the pitch black of the South Dakotan night, giving the impression I was looking into some endless void. One of the guards stepped out from his checkpoint and gave an uneasy look in my direction – he’d heard the broadcast as well, of course. He raised a hand in silent greeting to me and I returned it before turning away.\n\nThe other direction was the heart of the facility, another eighth of a mile in and beyond a gentle curve in the tunnel. I’d never been to the end of the tunnel, but just beyond the curve was the administrative offices, which I visited on a fairly regular basis for routine tasks. Corridor 3-F continues a lot farther than that and slopes downward after you pass the administrative offices before it disappears from sight.\n\n3-F was completely empty now, just a sickly yellow concrete and steel corridor that emanated the occasional echoes of activity from somewhere beyond my sight. Even though this was exactly what I experienced on nearly every shift, that emptiness felt menacing tonight, like the whole place had suddenly held its breath, waiting for something to come out of the shadows.\n\nAnother fifteen minutes passed uneventfully before the next message squawked through my radio, startling me out of the stressed focus I hadn’t even realized I’d fallen into.\n\n“*Alert. Containment breach in project lab 28. All personnel are required to maintain their posts. Intra-facility movement is now suspended. Quarantine protocols have been executed for sub-levels 5 through 8 and transport corridors 2-C and 4-A. Additional information forthcoming. End message.*”\n\n*Containment breach?*\n\n*Quarantine protocols?*\n\n*What the fuck is going on?*\n\nAccording to what I remembered from my orientation briefing, that sounded nothing but bad. The fact that all movement was now prohibited was even worse. That either meant that whoever had infiltrated the facility was still at large and was considered a high threat risk, or that some bit of nastiness had been released into the environment. \n\nI prayed it was the former. Who knew what sort of shit they were working on out here in the middle of nowhere?\n\nMovement from the entrance of the tunnel caught my attention and I stepped back out of my shack to get a better view, grabbing my rifle from the rack as I passed it.\n\nOne of the guards at the entrance checkpoint had moved to the center of the road, his carbine held at low-ready. I couldn’t see the other one, but the sudden appearance of multiple sets of high-intensity headlights made it nearly impossible to discern much of anything. I could hear shouted words being exchanged and then the guard lowered his rifle and stepped off the road. The roar of engines echoed to my ears as the vehicles passed through the entrance and raced in my direction.\n\nI was starting to prepare myself for action when the steel barricade behind me suddenly sprang to life, lowering itself into the road with the whining of electric motors. I only spared a moment’s attention before I glanced over at my console display mounted on the outside of my shack and took note of the blue letters flashing insistently across its surface.\n\n*QRT override accepted. Clearance authorized.* \n\nI stepped back into the doorway of my shack just as the three up-armored HUMVEES blew past my position, their matte-black paint job only broken by a few white stenciled numbers on their rear hatches. I couldn’t see past the dark tint of their windows, but I knew from the armored troop carrier compartment on the back that there were probably eight men in each.\n\nI moved back out into the corridor, watching their lights diminish as they sped away and rounded the curve, lost to my view. The sounds of the engines moaned back to me like the wail of some eldritch horror from the pit, and I quickly tried to shove that particular image out of my head.\n\n*What was the Quick Response Team doing here?* \n\nWhatever was going on, it must have been bad – those guys were all ex-special forces – real snake eaters. They had a near mythical status here, and to my knowledge had never been deployed for effect. I’d only ever seen them once before, during a scheduled drill, and even then, they were intimidating as hell and larger-than-life. \n\nLook, during my tours, I’ve had the opportunity to meet and get to know some of the finest SpecOps men in the business. People like to tease the SEALS as being attention-craving celebrities who are only ever one mission away from a best-seller, but let me tell you, all the Teams members I’ve known have been quiet and friendly. They were some of the most honorable, respectful, and stand-up guys you’ll ever meet. They were without a doubt, deadly warriors, but you’d never know it if you were just hanging out with them. Most were real down-to-earth types, just doing their duty for God and country.\n\n*These* guys, though, were something different, and if *they* were here, that meant the shit had really hit the fan somewhere, which had me more than a little unnerved.\n\nIt was at that moment that my attention was wrenched back from my thoughts as my radio squawked again, this time the automated voice was preceded by a series of tones.\n\n*“Alert. Containment breach in Sigma Lab. A general quarantine is now in effect for all facility regions and levels. All personnel are restricted to their current positions. Do not attempt to exit the facility. General containment resources have been deployed at all egress points. Zero-loss protocols have now been implemented. Additional information forthcoming as available. End message.”*\n\nI felt my face go cold and my pulse pounded in my temples at this new development. I reached out to steady myself against the checkpoint doorframe. The message repeated twice more before going silent again.\n\n*Fuck*.\n\nThis was bad. \n\n*Really* fucking bad.\n\nThis alert told me that the powers-that-be have now officially considered the entire facility to be compromised in some way and executed a complete lockdown. \n\n*Zero-loss protocols.* That was another way of saying that they were willing to go to any extreme to ensure that nothing leaves this facility. You know that lethal force thing I was talking about earlier, when I was telling you about their stance on unauthorized intruders?\n\nYeah, well, that has now been extended to include anyone currently within their quarantine zone, including yours truly.\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted as more headlights drew my attention once again to the entrance to the tunnel. This time, however, they were too tall to be HUMVEEs and had stopped their approach well short of the entrance, forming a rough semi-circle outside. \n\nI saw one of the checkpoint guards step out from their shack and raise a hand to the vehicles. I don’t know who it was – they were completely silhouetted by the headlights and I wasn’t even sure who was on shift tonight over there. He took a few steps forward, and I noted that he didn’t have his carbine in-hand this time. He must have said something, because an amplified voice from one of the vehicles’ PA systems answered back. It was too distant for me to make it out, but the insistent tone of the speaker was unmistakable.\n\nThe guard then raised his other hand, as if showing he wasn’t armed, and took another step towards the vehicles. I can only imagine that he was trying to convince them that he should be allowed to leave, that he was never technically in the facility. Those are the arguments I would be trying to make if I was him, anyway. The voice barked something again at him, short and emphatic.\n\nI felt my brow draw low and my eyes narrowed as I realized that the guard was still moving forward slowly, a step at a time, as if he was doing it subconsciously. \n\n“*No, you idiot!*” I heard myself mutter as my eyes widened, knowing exactly what was about to happen. “*Get back to your fucking post!*”\n\nBut he kept moving, slowly, unthreateningly. The voice on the PA system said one more thing that I couldn’t make out. He was giving him one last chance, I think.\n\nAnd that’s when the guard broke into a run, making for the gap between two of the vehicles.\n\nHe didn’t make it three steps. \n\nAutomatic gunfire from heavy bore machine guns erupted, the muzzle flashes from at least three of the vehicles strobing the darkness and the concussion ringing my ears, even more than a hundred yards away.\n\nThe guard crumpled like someone had flipped a switch, his momentum sending him into half-tumble for another few feet before coming to a rest as a bloody ball of rags. It’s not like in the movies, folks, where the bad guy stands there doing some sort of jittering dance while rounds are being pumped into his body, especially when you’re talking about .50 caliber slugs ripping out of a Browning M2 at 850 rounds per minute.\n\nIt shuts you down like someone just pulled the plug and turns you into hamburger. I had to look away from the smoking carnage that had only a few moments ago been a human being, just scared and trying to save himself.\n\n*Dammit*. He knew what was going to happen if he tried to run. He knew there was no way he was getting past them, and even if he did, what then? He was in the middle of nowhere – hell, they could have given him a two-minute head start and then *still* picked him off with the M2s without much trouble. \n\nHe had to know that. \n\nWe *all* knew that. So, why the hell had he tried to run? \n\nWhat did he *know*?\n\nWhat was so bad in his mind that a quick death at the hands of Mr. Browning’s progeny was preferable? That question scared me more than anything else in that moment.\n\nWhen the ringing in my ears began to subside, something else replaced it, from the tunnel behind me. \n\nFrom the depths of the facility. \n\nI looked back over my shoulder and then turned fully, eyes widening as I watched the tunnel lights in the distance begin to blink off, one by one, growing closer. It didn’t feel like the lights were extinguishing so much as it felt like the *darkness* was somehow approaching to smother them, rising from the shadowy sub-levels, where all those black-bag experiments were rumored to be happening. The air felt cold all of a sudden, like someone had just opened the door to a walk-in freezer, and I was mildly astonished to see my breath rise in billowy plumes of steam.\n\nThat’s when the sirens began to wail from somewhere deep in the mountain, sounding very thin and almost comically overdue at that moment. At the same time, the radio on my belt started emitting a single nonstop tone that I knew would prevent anyone from using them to communicate. I switched the radio off. \n\nThere weren’t going to be any more announcements.\n\nWe were being cut off, like a doctor amputating a diseased limb to save the rest of the patient. We were collateral damage in whatever the hell went wrong down there, in the bowels of this underground place, and we were going to be erased along with their mistake.\n\nA sudden and bellowing roar from the entrance hit me all at once, the shockwave staggering me forward a step and blowing concrete dust and smoke past me in a furious gale. It was fortunate I had turned away when I did, or the debris from the explosion might have sandblasted my eyes into blindness, leaving me to await my fate as I groped around sightless in this tomb.\n\nBefore I even looked, I knew what had happened. I knew the sound of demolition charges – my brother worked at an open-pit copper mine when I was younger, and I’d gone along with him a few times to watch the awesome display of pyrotechnics when they were cutting new lines. The only difference here was the continuing thunder of falling rock and debris as it rained down from the mountain entrance, sealing my only exit.\n\nThen that *other* sound came again, pulling my eyes back to the direction of the still-looming darkness. The shadows were much closer now, moving inexorably toward me. In the distance, I could just barely make out the sounds of small arms fire, a mix of handgun and rifle rounds. There may have been some shouting and screaming as well, but I can’t be sure.\n\nOvershadowing it all, pushing all other thoughts aside and to the back of my mind, was a low keening sound that flowed along the resounding walls of the tunnel, like a wash of something foul and fetid blowing over me. It was distinctly organic; this was no mechanical sound. But aside from those massive behemoths that roamed the ocean depths, I couldn’t imagine any creature on this planet producing such a tone. It was loud and low – more felt than heard – and it rattled my teeth and vibrated the hairs on my arms when it sang out.\n\nBut below that howl were others, wailing shrieks that could *almost* have been produced by human anatomy, but not quite. They were distant, their attention occupied with others, I thought, now hearing clearly the unmistakable screams of men and women echoing to my ears.\n\nAnd there are the quieter and more disturbing sounds of movement in the darkness that’s creeping towards me right now; sounds of dragging and sliding and wet breathing from somewhere in that black mass. If I squint my eyes a little, I can almost make out dark shapes hiding just beyond the reach of the light. I feel like, whatever may be there, human eyes were never meant to see it. When they reach me, I’m going to put my handgun to work. The only question is whether I’ll turn it on them or myself first.\n\n*What the hell did they do down there?*\n\n*What doors did they open?* \n\n[*And what came through when they did?*](https://www.youtube.com/@dark_night_tales)",

        "text": "This is a warning, I am the living reason why you should not do what I am about to tell you. There are things in this world that exist, some that we do not understand or believe. This is what happened to me and my two friends four years ago and why I am now paying the price.\n\nMe and my two mates loved our horror films, conventions and events. We had also done lots of Ouija boards, pentagram rituals, chanting and the rest! Now I know this may sound dangerous to some, but we really didn’t believe in all the shit that these things apparently bring upon their victims. \nWe would always say that it was a ploy to invest people in the horror genre and make horror films, games and experiences more scary.  In fact we were actively looking at new ways to summon “demons, spirits and witches” with chants, practices and actions. \nHow naive we were is beyond me but look we were young and dumb. Now I’m sure many are accustomed to the film “Candyman”, say his name five times in mirror and he comes and kills his victims. My friends Nathan and Charlie liked to browse the dark web, they even got mystery boxes delivered, one of the boxes even contained a blood stained knife. Nathan had a sizeable YouTube channel until it was taken down. I didn’t really get involved in any of that stuff though. One Friday night they both came round with something new to try and they said it was like the film Candyman. They explained that they found a phrase online that is said to summon the devils daughter named “Lucia”. I was intrigued and prompted them to tell me more. Nathan passed me a printed piece of paper with four written lines on it:\n\nLucia, Lucia, demon of the night,\nI speak your name with fear and spite.\nI call forth your power, dark and divine,\nI pray to survive until I am thine.\n\nHe told me that we have to say the lines into parallel mirrors, then she would appear behind you slowly. Lucia makes her way through the reflections, until finally she takes you. He was laughing by the end of that sentence at how stupid it sounded. I questioned him on what he meant by the “parallel mirrors”, he said it’s like when you have two mirrors facing each other it’s as if there is an almost an infinite amount of reflections. I immediately went back to him saying that I have that in my bathroom! He leaned in and stared at me, then snapped back saying that’s why we are here!\n\nWe each stood in front of the mirror, I had a smaller mirrored medicine cabinet adjacent to the main one above the sink. One at a time we said the satanic phrase, Charlie first, then Nathan. The tension grew after each one of us had finished. I went last, I finished the last word and the light went off. I shouted “what the fuck!” It turned out to just be Nathan messing around. We all looked into the mirror again but nothing happened. Charlie was the first to say it was all bullshit, like the rest of the stuff we had tried many times before. We all then went downstairs to watch some zombie budget film.\n\nLater that night after the guys had left I went to clean my teeth, as I was half way through  brushing my stomach dropped. I looked up to the train of mirrors in front of me. Just before my view was blocked by my own reflection, a girl stood in the distance. I couldn’t make out many features as she was so small, every time I moved myself for a better view I would still be in the way. I stared intently at her, she wasn’t disappearing. I know we had a few beers earlier and I put it down to the alcohol. I went to bed convincing myself it was all in my head. \n\nI woke the next morning, as I went into my bathroom my mind went back to what I had seen last night. I looked in the mirror, she was there again. This time she was not in the furthest reflection, she had moved forward to the next one up. I could see more features; a white dress with red patches, black straight hair, she was looking down to the ground as her arms dangled lifelessly beside her. I splashed water in my eyes and dried them with a towel. When I looked again she had moved once more to the next reflection. \nI rushed to my phone and called Charlie and Nathan, they both hadn’t seen anything and told me to stop being stupid. They were both working that day as they worked weekends so I couldn’t get them round to show them. I went online and spent the next four hours looking into what we had done and what i saw but found nothing. Half way through the afternoon I received a call from Charlie, he was breathing heavily and was just saying “what the fuck” repeatedly. I said back to him “you’ve seen her” his voice broke as he uttered the words she’s so close. I was confused as I could hardly see her the first time, I went back to him asking how many times he looked? \n\nHe said 6, she’s one away, like right next to me. I told him to get out of where he was and leave. I will never forget the loss of hope in his next sentence. “I’m in a cubicle, the toilets have mirrored walls”. I told him to cover his eyes and run, I would meet him outside his work soon. I turned up 25-30 minutes later, the place was evacuated with police outside. I asked some of the staff if they had seen Charlie and what had happened. They told me they heard a crash from the toilets, when they went in, the floor was covered in mirrored glass. Within the glass they saw blood with what looked like whole human finger nails and teeth. This was when they called the police. \nI called Charlie’s phone, I could hear ringing coming from a few officers outside the store. I went striding up to them, calling Charlie’s name as I walked. All three officers turned round and put there arms out to stop me. I noticed the ringing was coming from a clear sealed bag one of them was holding. They questioned me after I explained how I knew Charlie, I said nothing on what we had done or saw as they would have laughed it off. Once I got home I called Nathan, he already knew. He was also questioned by the police. He said that nothing had happened to him and that I was making up the whole thing. He said not to joke around if something bad had happened to Charlie. A few words were exchanged and Nathan moved away not long after that.\n\nAfter all of this I took the cabinet down, this  was done at the cost seeing her again. I spent the next year trying my best to not getting myself into a situation where there were parallel reflections. A year and a half later I found myself in a double mirror walled public toilet. The terror I felt as I went in and noticed was incomprehensible. There she was, only four reflections away. This time she was looking up at me, I could see her clearly. The black straight hair fell onto her white blood smeared dress, her eyes rolled upwards with only the red veins visible on the whites of her eyes. Her blackened fingertips capped with talons gripped the bottom of her dress. She was smiling at me, wearing deep red lipstick exposing yellowed sharpened teeth. Her pale, cracked decaying face glued to me as I walked in. There was a large crack behind me, i shot my head back as someone ran in. They apologised as they went into one of the cubicles. \n\nI looked back at the mirror, she had reached the third reflection from me. I started to panic, I could feel my knees shaking uncontrollably as her arm lifted. She was calling me closer with her hand. I shouted to leave me alone and ran out of the toilet. This was the last public toilet I have been into. Six months after this happened I received a call from Nathan’s parents, he had gone missing. The police had told them that everything in his apartment was left untouched except for the bathroom. This had been trashed,  was full of blood and broken glass. They had ran DNA tests and done dental records, they confirmed that it was Nathan. He had gone the same way as Charlie. She had got them both.\n\nI have now been living on my own in the countryside for two years, I only leave the house once or twice a month for a walk. I get all of my groceries and essentials delivered as I can’t risk supermarkets or stores. I own no mirrors only a laptop which I have put a non reflect screen cover on. I have only seen her twice these last two years, the last time she was reaching out to grab me. I know if I ever see her again it will be the last thing I ever see. \n\nYou have all been warned, please don’t make the same mistakes we did. It will cost you your life either way.",

        "text": "Before you read this, you should read [***Part 1.***](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cv83h/my_grandfather_included_me_in_his_will_before_he/)\n\n***-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***\n\nI finished reading the first chapter of the book- soul collecting 101. It took me the better half of the day, and even then I had to read it a couple more times to fully grasp what it was saying, what it was explaining. Everything sounded batshit crazy.\n\n*Every twentieth person has made a deal with the devil.*\n\nI didn't even know the devil was real.. I mean why would I think he is? Or is it a she? And every twentieth person? Does that mean every twentieth person is running around with no soul, filthy rich? Hot as hell? Or whatever else they wished for?\n\n*Souls aren't worth as much as you think, an average human soul doesn't interest the devil, and he won't buy it for outrageous wishes.*\n\nSo every twentieth person is maybe just a little richer, maybe just a little handsomer? But where does my grandfather come into play here? What was he doing?\n\n*As famously known, people often attempt to trick the devil into giving them their wish, while still being able to keep their soul, and sometimes the sold soul never makes it into the devil's hands. That's where Soul Collecting 101 comes into play. Devils do not wish to waste their time to collect lowly souls themselves, so they employ me- or you to collect it for them.*\n\nI wonder if my soul would be considered lowly? Would I get a good wish for it? That's not the point right now though. Since it doesn't say, I'll just assume they pay in lowly human currency for these jobs. How would I go about collecting a soul anyway?\n\n*Soul collecting is simple on paper, you have to make them willingly submit their soul, and then place it into a soul jar, which the devil provides.*\n\nThat sounds anything but simple. Make them willingly submit their soul? Who in their right mind would just give up their soul. Am I going to walk up to someone and be like \"Hey, you owe your soul to the devil, do you mind paying up?\".\n\nI take a deep sigh and place the book on the coffee table, laying back.\n\nWhat to do, what to do, what to do..\n\nMaybe I should call Ezekieel, none of this makes any logical sense. I frown at that thought. No, he'll think I'm actually interested in this then. I'm just testing the waters. All I really want is the cabin in the woods to sell.\n\n\"Hi!\" I suddenly hear a demonic voice say from somewhere in my apartment. I scream in horror, getting up frantically and looking around.\n\nI see a young boy, Luis standing in the doorway to my kitchen, still wearing his overalls, waving his hand at me. \"You scared me!\" I shout at him.\n\nHe sheepishly grins in respons. \"Oh I love doing that.\" He whispers under his breath, which I can still hear. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" He responds.\n\nI take another sigh. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"How's it going? Reading the rulebook I mean?\" Luis asks.\n\nI slump back into my cushioned chair, picking it back up. I've barely gone through the first 3 or 4 pages, and already have a massive headache trying to understand it all. It's like trying to study a combination of medicine and law while being high on LSD.\n\n\"Not good?\" Luis takes my silence for an answer.\n\nI nod to him.\n\n\"Well how about a little practical experience on soul collecting?\" He says, his demonic voice sounding excited, gosh that voice gives me the chills, but I perk up my ears to listen anyway.\n\nHe continues speaking. \"I have this guy, sold his soul to me a while ago, and as per our contract, I was to collect it on new years, well it's been two weeks since new years, and I still haven't heard a peep from him.\"\n\nI had so so many questions running through my head right now. Luis was a devil? What did the man wish for? Where was he now? Why do devils collect the souls of the living anyway?\n\nInstead of asking any of that, I just gulped down on my saliva and thought about my answer very carefully.\n\n\"What do I get out of it?\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah, I'll pay you no biggie.\" This devil is more like a young hippie. I saw his lips perk up into a grin.\n\n\"Hmm? Why are you smiling?\" I asked.\n\n\"You do know that I can read your thoughts?\"\n\nI flushed in embarrassment and horror. \"Get out of my head!\" I screamed at him.\n\n\"yeah yeah..\" He dismissed me like it was nothing.\n\n\"I can't answer all of your questions, but since he has already broken the contract, I can reveal the contents of his wish.\" I waited in anticipation, this would determine whether I'd do the job or not.\n\n\"He wished for his crime to be forgotten by all living beings.\"\n\n\"What was his crime?\" If he was a murderer, heck no. But if its just theft, then just maybe I'd go for it.\n\n\"I do not know.\" Luis responded sounding a little disappointed himself.\n\n\"What were all those people back in my grandfathers funeral? Were they all also devils?\" I asked.\n\n\"No I was the other devil present, I do not know all of those people, but I assume all of them were business partners in one way or another.\"\n\n\"How about Ezekieel?\" I asked.\n\n\"I would stay away from Ezekieel.\" Luis said grimly. I nodded along.\n\n\"So how about some experience in soul collecting?\" Luis tried using an uplifting tone, which just made his demonic voice sound really really weird.\n\n\"Can't you change your voice into something.. more human?\" I asked carefully, not trying to offend.\n\nLuis flashed hurt on his face. \"This is my true voice, why would I want to change it?\" I sighed in defeat.\n\n\"Alright alright, sorry I asked.\" He walked over to my tv. \"Fun fact, these things are often used as portals.\" He put his small hand on the screen, rubbing a spot in circles. The tv suddenly lit up and a channel opened. I could hear people's screams coming from the other end.\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked, curious.\n\n\"Hell.\" Luis smiled at me, and removed his hand, the tv turned back off again.\n\n\"So, how about it, you want the job or not? I don't have all day.\" I knew I couldn't avoid his question for the fourth time.\n\nI sighed. \"Only if you can give me a search area, or even better his direct location.\"\n\nLuis grinned at me then and walked up to me, reaching out his hand. I looked at it curiously. \"I can do one better.\" I took his hand and he pulled me up. \"This might hurt.\" He warned.\n\n\"Wait wait wait!\" I tried saying, but it was already too late. my clothes had already caught on fire and I could feel the heat on my skin. I tried flailing around, I tried putting out the flames but it was no use. It traveled upwards until it reached my torso, then my neck, and soon, my entire body was burning. The flames were incredibly hot, the heat was intense and I could feel it lick my skin. But strangely enough I thought it would hurt more.\n\nThe flames suddenly started going out slowly, and the intense heat disappeared. I opened my eyes again and the first thing I did was check myself. I was completely unharmed. My clothes, too were unburnt. How was this possible? My entire body was on fire.\n\n\"Was that fun?\" Luis asked with a smug expression. I gave him a look.\n\n\"Warn me next time?\" I said, feigning hurt. Truth was, this was fucking cool.\n\n\"I did warn you!\" Luis responded defensively. Had he been a normal boy, I bet we could've been the best of friends.. or okay not friends, maybe uncle and nephew.\n\n\"I am probably 300 times older than you are.\"\n\n\"Stop reading my mind!\" I warned him.\n\n\"Alright alright.\" He put his hands up defensively.\n\n\"Where did you take us?\" I started asking the important questions.\n\n\"To the sinner.\"\n\nI took this time to look around. I could tell that we were in a dark, small room, but nothing else besides that. Luis snapped his fingers and a small flame appeared in his hand, illuminating the room, which I now realized was a closet big enough for people to walk around in. I noticed a light bulb on the ceiling, with a string attached to it. I pulled on it and the light came on.\n\nI looked around for the door, and once I found it I attempted to open it carefully and quietly. It opened  into the outside, so I had to use a little force to push it open, which then resulted in the door banging against the wall, and the man whose home we were in to be alerted of it.\n\n\"What was that?\" I heard a male voice say from somewhere else. Luis shook his head at me.\n\nI stepped out of the closet, not sure what to do next. I looked around for a weapon, and found a table lamp which I quickly snatched up. The footsteps were getting closer. I hid behind the door, Luis was standing out in the open. \"What are you doing?\" I angrily whispered to him. \"He can't see me\" Luis said normally, and then added. \"Oh and he has a large knife.\" He grinned.\n\nI flipped him off with my middle finger. I saw the man's toes just barely past the door frame, but he stopped moving. Then suddenly he jumped into the room, facing the open closet door, luckily he didn't see me, because I was hidden behind the door. I heard the man sigh in relief and he walked up to the door and closed it. I was out in the open.\n\nI quickly lifted the table lamp up and smashed it on his head. He fell over and was knocked unconscious. Luis clapped his hands.\n\n\"Fuck off.\" I told him. \"Here's your soul, now take me home.\" He shook his head in response.\n\n\"You have to make him give it up.\" I suddenly remembered reading about it. I could just slap myself across the face.\n\n\"Make sure he doesn't wake up.\"\n\nAfter telling Luis, I walked through the apartment, searching for three simple things; a chair, rope, and duct tape. This man was living quite a rich life, making me believe my theory even more; the man was a robber.\n\nWith the chair and duct tape in hand, I returned to Luis, the man was still unconscious on the ground. I lifted him up and sat him down on the chair, and began trying to tie him up using the tape. Unfortunately no rope could be found, not like anyone just keeps rope around in their home anyway.\n\nAfter a good 10 minutes I finally felt confident enough that he wouldn't be able to break free. The man didn't look strong anyway, he was skinnier than I was, had almost no muscle and was pretty short.\n\nThe entire time Luis was just observing me and my actions, like teacher observing student.\n\n\"Well?\" I looked at him.\n\n\"Oh right the soul jar.\" Luis sprung into action, snapping his fingers once more. Flames burst out at my feet, before slowly succumbing into thin air, in their place stood a glass jar.\n\n\"By the way, if you fail to make him give up his soul, then you'll pay with yours instead.\" Luis said, giving me a sly smile. This fucking devil. He tricked me. I gulped down saliva, it was time for this guy to wake up.\n\nI slapped him across the face. He didn't budge. I walked to the kitchen and filled up a large cup with water, once I got back I poured it all over his head, this time he jolted awake. \"Please don't hurt me!\" He pleaded, trying to move in his bound state.\n\n\"That depends.\" I was trying to sound as cunning as possible.\n\n\"You signed your soul off to the devil, I have come to collect.\" I said in my deepest possible voice. I was standing in a darker corner of the room so he wouldn't be able to see me.\n\n\"Please, anything, just let me live.\" He pleaded again. I look at Luis for guidance, does this already count as giving up his soul? He just shrugged.\n\nI opened the jar and spoke. \"Say that you are willingly giving your soul away.\"\n\n\"I am giving my soul to this person.\" The man quickly said.\n\n\"He doesn't mean it, he has to mean it.\" Luis said behind me.\n\n\"You have to mean it.\" I repeated Luis's words to the man.\n\n\"Okay okay.\" \"I am willingly giving my soul away!\" He said rapidly. I saw a small orb appear from his chest. It hovered above the man.\n\n\"Again.\" I said.\n\n\"I give my soul away! Take it please!\" I was a little confused on why this man was so terrified of me. I mean if he just said no, I'd be the one to give my soul to the devil instead?\n\nThe orb slowly started to move towards me. I held up the jar and it floated inside. I closed it.\n\n\"Happy?\" I said out loud.\n\nLuis nodded and clapped his hands.\n\n\"Oh no.. It's- it's you!\" The man was looking at Luis wide-eyed.\n\n\"You can see him?\"\n\n\"I have ownership of his soul now, so naturally he can see me.\"  Luis said, sounding uninterested.\n\n\"I never signed my soul to you! Only some of my memories!\" He accused Luis.\n\n\"Well I wanted your soul as well.\" He said.\n\nWhat the fuck is going on? I looked at Luis, my eyes pleading for an answer.\n\n\"He didn't owe me a soul, but you just made him give it up, so thank you for that.\" He smiled.\n\nI was frozen in place. He fucking tricked me. Twice.\n\n\"Untie the man, we're leaving.\" I nodded and cut the tape with scissors.\n\n\"Please give it back.\" The man pleaded. I could only look at him with my sorry, regretful eyes. Luis snapped his fingers and my clothes caught on fire again. Soon, I was back in my apartment, standing in the exact same spot as before we left.\n\n\"You tricked me.\" I said under my breath.\n\n\"Yeah well that's also a valuable lesson.\"\n\nThis devil, demon, whatever you want to call him, I let my guard down because he seemed innocent, he seemed nice. He looked like a kid with a scary voice.\n\n\"Well I'll be on my way, I hope this practical experience will help you in your future endevours of collecting souls.\" He said nonchalantly. He had a strange look in his eyes. I couldn't tell whether it was regret, or triumph.\n\nHe burst into flames and disappeared into thin air. I sighed and leaned back on my chair once more.\n\nLooking at the time, it was getting late now. So I decided to head to bed.\n\nToday I learned to not trust the devil, no matter how nice or innocent he may [look.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)",

        "text": "I lost my sister, Hana, to bullying two months ago. She had been attacked by bullies in the bathroom. They hit her, kicked her, left her in a state of disarray. Her clothes were bloodied, stained red. I can vividly remember when she came home that day and silently went upstairs, her lips, clothes, shoes, and nose bright red. That day, she hung herself in her room using a bathroom towel. \n\nHana was always a bright girl, and the best older sister one could have. She was my best friend. She cared for me when my parents were at work. She was the one who fed me, she tended to my injuries, she comforted me at my lowest lows. Before she died, she had a bright future ahead of her. She had been accepted into NYU, and she had planned to be a doctor. But those bullies took that away from her, and now she's dead. During her funeral, I was forced to watch as her body laid inside a oak casket, her hands resting on her stomach, her eyes closed. She looked so peaceful, and I felt that she was finally happy in heaven, no longer suffering. \n\nThese last few weeks have been torture for me. My dad's been drinking nonstop now. Our house, once clean, is now a mess. My mom locked Hana's room, and none of us are allowed to enter. Our neighbors have been sending us our condolences, but their condolences won't bring back Hana. \n\nSchool's horrible as well. I've been bullied nonstop by those same bullies that killed Hana. They're happy that she's dead. Now that she's dead they have something to bully me about. Every day I come home with a battered lip or bloody nose, but I don't say anything. \n\nHowever, this past week the bullying's only been getting worse. More and more people have joined in teasing me about my sister's death. I've had mud thrown at me, I've been beaten senseless, yet I just endure it. Who cares anyway? No one gives ten shits about me. My parents were grieving, and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't care if I died. Hana was always the golden child, and I was the one in the goddamn corner, ignored by my parents. \n\nMy thoughts have been tainted with thoughts of revenge, suicide, and murder. I just want to avenge them, make them suffer the way Hana did when they beat her senseless. I just want to kill them, make them pay for what they've done\n\nYesterday, I bought myself earmuffs and a tub of gasoline from the gas station. The attendant raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What's the gasoline for?\" The attendant asked. I pointed to the car parked outside. But that wasn't my car, that was Hana's. Even before she died, my parents forbade me from driving it, but that day I secretly used it while my parents were at work. \n\n\"Couldn't you have just used one of the filling stations?\" The attendant asked.\n\n\"It's just in case my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere,\" I said, which, of course, was a complete lie. The attendant rang up the total, which turned out to be $30.00. I paid, then walked outside. After going home, I put my plan into motion. I grabbed my dad's lighter and put that on my desk, followed by the tub of gasoline, the earmuffs, and a pair of glasses. Sitting behind all those was my dad's Glock 26. Small pistol, semi auto, 10 round capacity. I had learned how to use a gun during the summer, and tomorrow was the perfect time to practice. \n\nToday, I poured the tub of gasoline all over my house and lit the house on fire. My parents were inside, but there were two kitchen knives plunged into their heads anyway, so no one would hear their screams. I drove to my school, loading my Glock on the way, and stuffed it in my pocket. Today was the day that I would get revenge on everyone who killed my sister and bullied me senseless, and I was going to make sure none of my sister's tormentors left the building.",

        "text": "My father was a police officer in the 1990s, and he told me about a strange series of cases throughout New England where the children had apparently killed their parents while the parents slept. Sometimes the kids would slit their parents’ throats while they were sleeping, while other times they would douse the house in gasoline and burn them alive. A couple of the children chopped their parents up with axes while their parents slept. But all of the kids had one thing in common- they said they had watched a show called Laughing Island before committing these horrific crimes.\n\nNow there is no record of a show by this name ever existing, but all of the children described it exactly the same way. It would start with a puppet called the Grinning Man dancing around the screen. The Grinning Man puppet had hundreds of sharp teeth and huge jet-black eyes, and would often start the show by teaching the kids about safety. He would play with lighters and matches and show how playing with these toys could burn down his whole toy neighborhood- laughing the whole time while other puppets would burn, screaming and running around in front of the cameras while on fire. They used canned laughter every time the Grinning Man would accidentally kill the other puppets in his neighborhood, covering up the screams of the puppets with uproarious laughter from the audience.\n\nHe would teach the kids about knives by running around the island with the knife pointed out, accidentally skewering any other puppets who got in his way. They would show real blood flowing from the puppet’s wounds, the camera zooming on their screaming faces as the audience laughed.\n\nThe Grinning Man would also play hide and seek with the kids on the island, real children who would hide around the set while the Grinning Man put his head down and counted to thirty. When he found a child, he would grab them and the child would start screaming, and never be seen on the show again.\n\nMy father told me all of this with a whiskey in his hand, his grizzled salt-and-pepper stubble making him look far older than he actually was. He had retired early with a pension after being shot in the leg by a drug dealer during a traffic stop gone wrong.\n\n“But you know what the craziest part about this whole Laughing Island thing was?” he asked me, his eyes watery and unfocused. I shook my head.\n\n“When the family of the kids went to check on them while they watched the show, they said the kids would just be staring at a black screen. The TV wasn’t even on. Sometimes the TV wasn’t even plugged in. Kids would go up in the attic and watch old TVs that hadn’t worked in years, but they claimed they could see the show, bright as day, and they explained what happened during it. Nearly all of those kids are dead now, though some are still catatonic in mental asylums around the state. They don’t talk, they don’t move, they just sit there like statues, staring off into a world that none of us can see.\n\n“But after the crimes were committed, the kids were full of energy and talking a mile a minute. They were bursting at the seams with joy! They claimed that the Grinning Man had told them they needed to teach their parents a lesson about safety, and that now that they had followed his instructions, he would come for them and take them away to Laughing Island, where every day was like Christmas and it was illegal to be sad or angry. \n\n“If anyone was sad or angry, a massive puppet called Sheriff Hogan would arrive. The way these kids described him, it sounded as if he was dressed like a Nazi SS soldier, with pure black military clothing, polished high leather boots and a gleaming black leather cap. He was ten feet tall and towered over the little children, who often wet themselves out of terror when they saw the Sheriff Hogan puppet arrive. He would take them to the center of the island and bury them alive, telling them in a sing-song voice, ‘No angry kiddies, no sad kiddies, no evil kiddies and no bad kiddies on Laughing Island.’ They would scream the entire time while the puppet threw them in a hole and filled it with sand and dirt, but after a few minutes they would stop screaming. And the rest of the kids knew what would happen to them if they ever got sad or angry on Laughing Island, so they always had forced grins and pretended like they were always happy.”\n\n“Could this have been some sort of mass delusion, like the Salem Witch Trials?” I asked. “Maybe one kid just made up the whole show in his head and told other kids at school about it, and it spread like some sort of urban legend. Maybe it was just a coincidence, like the mentally ill children who would most likely be violent anyways were the ones affected by the urban legend.” My father shook his head, his flabby cheeks shaking as he did so. His bottom lip quivered for a moment, then stilled.\n\n“There was no connection between the children. We checked. They all attended different schools, different daycares, no shared bus routes, no shared friends or family. It was eerie how the Laughing Island thing seemed to spread across the city, and then across the state. The news made it into a moral panic, like the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, but no one knew exactly what to do about it. Then one day, it just stopped.” He looked up at me. “At least, we thought it did. I just got a call from an old cop friend, who is now Captain of the city police, and he said a six year-old kid just drugged his parents and skinned them alive. He butchered the job, but after hours of trying he managed to get most of the skin off. Apparently he was wearing his father’s skin like a mask, running around the streets and laughing when the cruisers found him. And guess what he said?” I shook my head, not even venturing a guess.\n\n“The kid said that the Grinning Man made him do it.” \n\n“That’s… really sick. And sad,” I said, not knowing what else to say. My father nodded grimly.\n\n“It is. I only wish we could find some way to stop it.” I looked out the window and realized it was getting dark.\n\n“Well, dad,” I said, “I have to get going.” My wife was watching our child, but she wanted me home for dinner. He nodded.\n\n“Be careful out there, son,” he said. I drove home through the darkening city streets, thinking about everything he had said. I couldn’t imagine such atrocities being committed in our city, of all places- and by *children*, at that.\n\nWhen I got home, I took a few deep breaths in my car, trying to clear the horrifying conversation from my mind before going inside. As I entered the living room, my breath caught in my throat.\n\nI saw my son there, sitting inches away from the TV, watching a totally black screen.",

        "text": "I'm going to write more things about my city, as you who read part 1 know, it is cursed by a witch who fulfills wishes in exchange for curses, at least that's what the old man told me. I asked him if there was any way to break the curse but he said he didn't know, he said I had to ask the witch herself who is already dead but her spirit still roams the city at night.\n\n So I continued my day normally until nightfall I told my mother that I was going to sleep at a friend's house to study for a school project and luckily she accepted so when the sun disappeared over the horizon I left the house and went after the damn witch.\n\nPeople report that his spirit appears in various places, sometimes on top of buildings sometimes in dark alleys or in abandoned houses. maybe his spirit still hangs out there because it's his old home, old Joe told me the cabin is in the woods north of town so I walked over there.\n\nWhen I reached the forest everything was silent the only sound was my sneakers stepping on the branches.\n\nI went deeper and deeper into the forest when I saw something at the bottom, it was the old witch's hut. I approached calmly and saw the spirit, a shadow of a woman that almost camouflages itself in the darkness of the night.\n\nI approached her calmly and said: ''Hello, are you the wishing witch?'' She turned to me and said quietly: ''What do you want?'' I replied:''tell me how to break the curse of town.'' She replied, ''The only way to break the curse is for the cursed one to die.'' She said that the cursed one was old Joe.\n\n cursed being that the one hit was joe. She explained several things, said that her curses have several levels depending on the wish that the person asks.\n\nIf the person asks for a lighter wish, the curse will only hit the cursed person but if the wish is something stronger like curing a serious illness like cancer, the curse will be stronger and will hit everything around the cursed person. she why is she helping me, she said that she suffers from her own curse and her spirit is also trapped in this city.\n\nWell after all these questions and answers I waited for dawn to go back home I got home dead of sleep but I had to go to school I took my backpack and went to school. On the way back I stopped by Joe's house to tell him everything. Joe opened the door, I went into his house and told him everything.\n\nSo he said he was going to kill himself that sentence scared me I didn't think he was going to do that. I told him it could be the witch's lie but he didn't hesitate he told me to go away so I had no choice. I went back to my house wondering if I really should have told him that, that could very well have been a lie from the witch. I went home and continued my day. At night I decided to turn on my TV and I saw news of an old man named Joe who died of poisoning, He really killed himself and it was my fault. I went to sleep and woke up the next day to see if the curse was over I called the TV and, the cases of murders and suicides continue. Why did I trust that damn witch!\n\nI feel guilty I made a poor old man kill himself.\n\nI'll try to find more curse answers maybe I'll find them in the witch's hut I'll go there to see if I can find aything else. I'll update here if I find answers.\n\nHello, it's the next day and I'm going to write this text again. When I was returning from school I went to the witch's hut her spirit was no longer there I entered the hut and there were several things inside like the skulls of other animals, potions and a pentagram there was also an old wooden cabinet I opened and inside were several books books, I took them all and put them in my backpack and took them home. Now I am studying these books, they are written in a strange language.\n\nI tried using the translator but it didn't work so right now I'm searching the Internet to see if I can find anything related to this mysterious language. \n\nI went back and unfortunately I didn't find anything in that language but something very strange happened. Today I was coming back from school there was a boy following me and it was Ryan, the smartest boy in the room I thought it was strange, when I turned around to ask him why he was following me jumped on top of me knocking me to the ground and tried to hang me while he was hanging me he said: ''give me back my books you little brat'' Luckily a person passing by helped me and took Ryan off of me.\n\nAfter that Ryan ran off I thought it was very strange he said to return the books he was probably referring to the witch's books and the tone of his voice was not normal and like he was possessed so probably the witch's spirit knew that I I took her books and possessed Ryan to try to get them back. After that I was thinking that if the witch wants to, she can possess my father or mother to try to take the book from me or she can possess me so I can return the book to her. Well now I need to be suspicious of any of my friends or family because they may be possessed by that damn witch.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to write this report. I'll keep researching the language of the books. Probably the next report will be in part 3. Wish me luck to break this curse.",

        "text": "I am a big fan of anything creepy, spooky, paranormal, you name it. I go hunting for monsters frequently, and I was pretty convinced I'd find something eventually. Surprisingly, the odd thing I was hoping to find was in my house's attic. \n\nI had been tasked by my mother to clean out the old attic, as it hadn't been touched in years. It took an hour just to get rid of the dust and cobwebs, so I was pretty tired by the time I had to sort out the items. Most of it was useless junk, keepsakes, and things I thought I lost years ago but were apparently jammed up here without being told. After about an hour of looking around, I had found a box with my father's name on it. We'll call him \"Frank.\"  Considering I haven't seen my dad in years, and my mom never talked about him, I was very curious. I opened the box, and found a few things inside.  \n\nFirst, I found a stuffed animal of a lion. The lion's fur was covered in black, crusty stains that felt like the texture of dirt. A note on it read \"From: Frank. Will you  be my friend?\" I set it off to the side to look at more interesting stuff.\n\nThe second item was a stack of papers. It had random words written on it like \"cat,\" \"bee,\" and \"red.\" The writing seemed to get progressively better as I went on, but it was more like going from barely readable, to a child's semi-understandable handwriting. \n\nThe third item was some old, expired candy. I didn't think much of it and ended up throwing it off to the side. \n\nThe fourth was another expired bag of food, but this time it was an off-brand bag of potato chips. Again, this item also didn't seem very important. \n\nThe fifth item was exactly what I was looking for. It was a journal. Since my mother always refuses to answer any questions about my dad, this surely would. I opened the journal up, ready to find out what my dad's life was like.\n\n\"I am not the type to write a journal, but I figured since my current assignment is of the more dangerous and uncertain type, I will write it so at least somebody will know what happened to me - in case this mission does kill me. I am to investigate a strange entity that was captured sneaking around one of our laboratories. It seemed to be trying to release one of our bioweapons. Melissa was quickly alerted of this, so she sent a team of soilders to capture the entity. After a while, it was confirmed to be secure and was sent to me to be researched. I wasn't sure if I should be glad that I am considered such a high level researcher where I can investigate top secret entities such as this one, or if I should be terrified. There's no turning back now.\"\n\nI didn't know how I was supposed to feel reading this. According to this tiny journal in my hand, somewhere out there, there is a lab with paranormal creatures and bioweapons? This felt like something out of a book to be honest, which is the kind of stuff I like, but I was a bit disappointed. I didn't think this was going to be real at all. I wanted a real story of my dad's life, not some sort of science fiction story he probably wrote for himself. \n\nDespite all of this, I knew that my school's \"Paranormal Investigation Club,\" (which was sadly, not a real club but something me and my friends had made up) would appreciate it. I called them, and three of my friends said they would come. \n\nWhile I was waiting for them to get here, I continued to read the story. However, I found out that most of it wasn't very story-like. It was just a bunch of scientific nonsense that I might've been able to understand if I paid attention to biology and chemistry class. I began to regret calling them over, but I was able to pull out some information from the book. I wrote down the information on a sheet of paper.\n\n\"1. The entity is not made out of anything on the periodic table.\n\n2. The entity can change shape and color. None of my father's tests were able to prove why.\n\n3. The entity has potential to be a sentient being\n\n4. Lots of what my dad does seems to be conducted with the help of \"Melissa.\" However, he seems to be deeply afraid of Melissa. \n\n5. The entity has copied my dad's behavior before. He is going to start training the entity.\"\n\nI decided to save the \"training the entity\" part as something me and my friends to read together, since it seemed much more understandable then whatever I just read. It was just in time when I heard some people knocking at the door. \n\nI ran downstairs and opened the door for them. My mom scowled when she saw them, and pulled me to the side.\n\n\"I told you to clean the attic, not hang out with your friends. Finish cleaning, then you can go do your ridiculous monster hunting things,\" she whispered loudly.\n\nI just begged her to let us go in the attic. I told her that I just wanted to show them evidence of a ghost in the attic. Then, we would all clean up the attic together and get it done super quickly. My mom reluctantly agreed, and let my friends inside. \n\nI led my friends into the attic, and then to the old journal. My friends all looked eager to see what was inside. My friend \"Cathy\", a girl with a gothic fashion sense and obsidian black hair who was obsessed with ghosts, asked if I was lying about there being ghosts in my attic. I replied \"Sadly, yes.\"\n\nMy friend \"Lisa\" a messy-haired girl with a dad who is obsessed with monster hunting, asked if my dad's journal revealed that my dad was a monster hunter too. \"Not really,\" I replied, \"apparently he was a scientist who researched a strange monster.\"\n\nLisa and Cathy both looked excited to open the book. However, my third friend, \"Dave,\" seemed have been uneasy since he saw my mother. Dave was one of my newest friends, and this is the first club meeting he has been to. All of my friends are outcasts, but Dave was a whole new level of weird. He acted normal, I guess, but nothing seemed natural about him. It was as if the muscles in his face were built wrong. He could smile wider than a normal person could. He could open his eyes wider than any person could. On top of that, everything about him was perfectly symmetrical. His face was perfect, his clothing was incredibly boring but nice, and his hair was neatly combed. We didn't mind befriending him though, since we accepted everyone with an interest of supernatural things to our group. Dave seemed nervous about this. \n\n\"So, I'm not sure if this journal is real or fake, but it's definitely the biggest piece our club has found in a very long time. In fact, after I explain the entity my dad was researching, we can read the next section together. How does that sound?\" I asked.\n\nCathy and Lisa nodded their heads. Dave nodded his reluctantly.\n\nAnd so, I explained what I thought about my dad's job, and what the entity was like. As we were talking, Dave began to look at some of the other stuff my dad had. He took the expired bag of potato chips, opened them, and started to eat them. \n\n\"Hey, don't eat those! That's one of my dad's things!\" I snapped at him, much ruder than I anticipated. I quickly corrected myself. \"Well uhm, they're also expired. You'll get a stomachache.\"\n\nDave seemed to sort of understand, and put the chips down. He began to play around with the lion instead. Wanting to get on with the journal, I just ignored him. \n\nI then began to talk about Melissa, who I though to be my dad's boss. \n\n\"Hey,\" my mom called to us, \"It doesn't seem like you two are talking about ghosts. Stop talking about this \"Melissa\" lady and start cleaning if you kids aren't going to talk about ghosts.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I whispered, \"We'll just talk quieter then. Are we ready to start reading the journal?\"\n\nMy friends nodded their heads, and I began to read out loud to them. What was in the journal was surprisingly wholesome.\n\n\"I began the entity's training by teaching it simple movements. I taught it how to wave hello with one of it's black, inky hands. I then taught it how to move around in a circle, nod and shake it's head, and even dance to music. However, anytime I came in to do my research, it always shook it's head for no. So, I began to look for food it likes. At first, I tried feeding it candy. It seems to really hate sweet foods. I found that it really enjoys potatoes, especially potato chips. It was more happy to be taught these things when it was rewarded with potato chips.\"\n\nThe journal entries of these events were much more fun to read then the previous ones. It was as if my dad was training a dog. \n\n\"Eventually, I had taught the being how to talk, read, and write. The being's human transformation is a bit unsettling, but it is still impressive for Melissa. I even gave it a stuffed lion for comfort, and it seems to really enjoy it. Now, I can finally figure out what this creature's motives were.\"\n\nI almost immediately flipped to the next page, eager to see what would happen next.\n\nEverything felt like it was going downhill as I read it.\n\n\"I found out that the entity was not of this world, but some sort of very far away point in space. I predict it used some sort of wormhole to get close to Earth.\"\n\n\"The entity claims that its ancestors had been here before a long, long time ago, and would shapeshift into humans.\"\n\n\"The entity said it was told that \"they are here to finally make this land their home.\" It said that \"there were too many people living here, so we must find a way to get rid of them. Luckily, the people there had things that would make it easy.\"\n\n\"Melissa was finally able to confirm that the entity was hostile. She wanted to get rid of it. We finished our mission. However, I knew that the entity wasn't evil. It couldn't have been. It was so sweet. It had its own interests and preferences, it had a favorite stuffed animal. It was like a human child. I wanted to keep it. I wouldn't let Melissa get rid of it.\"\n\n\"I knew what I had to do. If my workplace was against creature, then I'm against the workplace.\"\n\n\"Me and the entity had finally gotten rid of the workplace. I don't even care about the horrors that escaped it. At least we're both safe.\"\n\n\"Melissa survived. She hates me. She had went completely insane. I don't have much time left. I shouldn't have married this woman.\"\n\nThe rest of the pages were blank. I closed the book. \"Well, uhh... I guess this is the end. It's probably just a story though.\"\n\nI felt dizzy. My heart was racing. I knew this story had to be fake, but a part of me said it had to be real.  I slowly walked out of the attic, listening to a conversation from downstairs. \n\n\"Melissa?\" Dave asked. What was Dave doing down there?\n\n\"No, my name is Stephanie. Didn't my son tell you about my beforehand?\"\n\n\"Melissa... It's me.\" I head a scream. I fell down the attic stairs, and ended up passing out.\n\nWhen I woke up, my house was empty. I had a note next to me. The note was poorly written, and had multiple punctuation and grammar errors. \n\n\"Hello. Jamie. You know your dad Frank? I guess you are friend now like him? Well I got rid of Melissa.  Who is not my friend. The other girls tried to stop. I guess they weren't friend too. But you didn't respond to me so I just did it myself and left goodbye.\" \n\nDid what?\n\nI looked downstairs. Three dead bodies, who I couldn't even tell apart were lying on the ground. All of them were covered in a black, inky substance. I just went to the bathroom and threw up. I'm not sure if I should be glad I survived or not. My new friend is a monster. My family is dead. I don't even know if I should call the police or not, since I don't know if I'll get involved with even more creepy science stuff. \n\nI am terrified of monsters now. I want nothing to do with them.",

        "text": "I'm going to write more things about my city, as you who read part 1 know, it is cursed by a witch who fulfills wishes in exchange for curses, at least that's what the old man told me. I asked him if there was any way to break the curse but he said he didn't know, he said I had to ask the witch herself who is already dead but her spirit still roams the city at night.\n\n So I continued my day normally until nightfall I told my mother that I was going to sleep at a friend's house to study for a school project and luckily she accepted so when the sun disappeared over the horizon I left the house and went after the damn witch.\n\nPeople report that his spirit appears in various places, sometimes on top of buildings sometimes in dark alleys or in abandoned houses. maybe his spirit still hangs out there because it's his old home, old Joe told me the cabin is in the woods north of town so I walked over there.\n\nWhen I reached the forest everything was silent the only sound was my sneakers stepping on the branches.\n\nI went deeper and deeper into the forest when I saw something at the bottom of the old witch's hut I calmly approached and saw the spirit, a shadow of a woman that almost camouflages itself in the darkness of the night.\n\nI came up calmly and said ''hello are you the wishing witch? how do you break the curse of the town?''She replied:''The only way to break the curse is for the cursed to die.''She said that the cursed was old Joe. cursed being that the one hit was joe. She explained several things, said that her curses have several levels depending on the wish that the person asks.\n\nIf the person asks for a lighter wish, the curse will only hit the cursed person but if the wish is something stronger like curing a serious illness like cancer, the curse will be stronger and will hit everything around the cursed person. she why is she helping me, she said that she suffers from her own curse and her spirit is also trapped in this city.\n\nWell after all these questions and answers I waited for dawn to go back home I got home dead of sleep but I had to go to school I took my backpack and went to school. On the way back I stopped by Joe's house to tell him everything. Joe opened the door, I went into his house and told him everything.\n\nSo he said he was going to kill himself that sentence scared me I didn't think he was going to do that. I told him it could be the witch's lie but he didn't hesitate he told me to go away so I had no choice. I went back to my house wondering if I really should have told him that, that could very well have been a lie from the witch. I went home and continued my day. At night I decided to turn on my TV and I saw news of an old man named Joe who died of poisoning, He really killed himself and it was my fault. I went to sleep and woke up the next day to see if the curse was over I called the TV and, the cases of murders and suicides continue. Why did I trust that damn witch!\n\nI feel guilty I made a poor old man kill himself.\n\nI'll try to find more curse answers maybe I'll find them in the witch's hut I'll go there to see if I can find aything else. I'll update here if I find answers.\n\nHello, it's the next day and I'm going to write this text again. When I was returning from school I went to the witch's hut her spirit was no longer there I entered the hut and there were several things inside like the skulls of other animals, potions and a pentagram there was also an old wooden cabinet I opened and inside were several books books, I took them all and put them in my backpack and took them home. Now I am studying these books, they are written in a strange language.\n\nI tried using the translator but it didn't work so right now I'm searching the Internet to see if I can find anything related to this mysterious language. \n\nI went back and unfortunately I didn't find anything in that language but something very strange happened. Today I was coming back from school there was a boy following me and it was Ryan, the smartest boy in the room I thought it was strange, when I turned around to ask him why he was following me jumped on top of me knocking me to the ground and tried to hang me while he was hanging me he said: ''give me back my books you little brat'' Luckily a person passing by helped me and took Ryan off of me.\n\nAfter that Ryan ran off I thought it was very strange he said to return the books he was probably referring to the witch's books and the tone of his voice was not normal and like he was possessed so probably the witch's spirit knew that I I took her books and possessed Ryan to try to get them back. After that I was thinking that if the witch wants to, she can possess my father or mother to try to take the book from me or she can possess me so I can return the book to her. Well now I need to be suspicious of any of my friends or family because they may be possessed by that damn witch.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to write this report. I'll keep researching the language of the books. Probably the next report will be in part 3. Wish me luck to break this curse.",

I mean, I don't know. It might just be some kids messing around or something but - \n*Caller goes quiet for a few seconds*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Hello?\n\n\n\n\nCaller: - I'd  feel better if someone came out to check. \n\n\n\nDispatcher: What is your address?  \n\n\n\nCaller: 1056 [Redacted] \n\n\n\nDispatcher: And what is your name? \n\n\n\nCaller: It's Erin Feller\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay, Erin. I have officers on the way. What's going on?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: Well, I was calling my dog in from the backyard and she was growling at something out there. I couldn't see what though. I finally got her to come inside and the second I closed the door and locked it, something smacked into the glass window. Not hard enough to break it but it was hard enough to rattle the door. \n\n\nDispatcher: What time was this?  \n\n\n\nErin Feller: About 5 minutes ago. \n\n\n\nDispatcher: Were you able to see anyone?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: No. There's blinds on my back door and they were down, but I heard the door knob jiggling a few times before I called you. \n\n\n*Caller tries to quiet her dog who can be heard growling*\n\n\nErin Feller: I yelled that I was calling the police and the noises stopped but ….. like I said, it could be some kids but I don't know.\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay. And have you heard any other noises since then? \n\n\n\nErin Feller: No. Just the door. But my dog's still growling.\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay. I have an officer en route to you, Erin. Are the doors and windows locked?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: Yes, they're locked. \n\n\n\nDispatcher: Alright, an officer should be out to you shortly.  Stay inside and keep the doors locked until the officer arrives, okay? \n\n\nErin Feller: Okay. Thank you \n\n\n\nDispatcher: You're welcome.  \n\n\n*Call ended*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Officer Collier was dispatched to the location. He saw no signs of any persons around the property.  He did note that the dog was still anxious and growling at the back door.  He advised Ms Feller to keep her doors locked and call if she should see or hear anything else.*  \n\n\n\n\n911 call came in at 1:27 am 12/12/2020\n\n\n\nDispatcher: 911 what is your emergency?  \n\n\n\nErin Feller: It's me again. Can you send an officer back out please? \n*Caller is in obvious distress, and breathing rapidly*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Is this for [1056 Redacted]?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: Yes. Someone was just looking in through my front window.  Can you just send someone? \n\n\n\nDispatcher: I have an officer en route to you. You said you saw someone looking through your windows?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: Yes. I was in bed but Ginger, my dog, ran to the front door, growling. I pulled up the blinds a bit, but didn't see anything at first. Then I saw a face pop up. But just the top of their head and eyes. Like they were playing peekaboo or something.  I screamed and Ginger started barking and going nuts, and the person popped down out of view again. *Breathing is erratic*\n\n\n\n\nDispatcher: How long ago was this?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: A few minutes ago. They popped up again, just before I called you. But they went back down under the window. I'm in my bedroom now. \n\n\n\nDispatcher: Did you recognize the person ma'am? \n\n\n\nErin Feller: No. I only saw their eyes and the top of their head. But they looked….  I don't know, like a mime or something.  \n\n\n\nDispatcher: A mime? \n\n\n\nErin Feller: Yes! White makeup on their face and head. *Unintelligible* really disturbing.  \n\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay. I want you to stay on the phone with me until the officer arrives.  Just stay in your room until you hear them. \n\n\n\nErin Feller: Okay. \n\n\n\nDispatcher: Does your bedroom door have a lock?\n\n\n\nErin Feller: Yes. It's locked. \n\n\n*Dispatch stayed on the line with Ms Feller until officers arrived.  Officers arrived and announced themselves 11 minutes later and the call was terminated* \n\n\n*Officers Copeland and Laurie arrived on scene to find Erin Feller in great distress. Ms Feller claimed to have seen a mime at her door. Officers noted that Ms Feller did not seem to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Ms Feller seemed anxious but lucid.*\n\n\n\n*Ms Feller pointed out to the officers where she'd seen the suspect peering through her window.  The glass had no visible marks on it other than a smear of white paint. Officers were able to see two impressions in the dirt just underneath the windowsill outside the laundry room. Officers stated the impressions looked as if someone had been standing barefoot, on the tips of their toes. Officers checked the area and the field surrounding the home and found a trail of footprints leading away from the home to the woods behind Ms Feller's home. When followed, the footprints seemed to be erratic and moving around in a zigzag pattern. The prints stopped abruptly at a large tree, but there were no signs of any persons in the tree. The footprints looked to be made by someone who was barefoot and walking solely on their toes. Officers checked the woods but found nothing of note. Officers spoke with the closest neighbors, a half a mile down the road. The neighbors stated they hadn't heard or seen anything out of the ordinary. Officers reminded Ms Feller to keep her doors locked and advised her to call back if the person or persons returned.*  \n\n\n\n\n\n911 call came in at 3:41 am on 12/12/2020\n\n\nDispatcher: 911 what is your emer-\n\n\nErin Feller: I need the police now! *Caller is in obvious distress. The sound of her dog can be heard barking in the background*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Is this for [1056 Redacted]\n\n\n\n\nErin Feller: Yes! I just saw that person looking in my bedroom window! I was asleep and heard tapping on my window and when I looked up that face was pressed up against the glass! How long before the police get here? \n\n\n\n*Caller can be heard breathing rapidly and sounds as if she's moving around the house.*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: I have officers en route to you now, Ms Feller. Can you lock yourself in your bedroom? \n\n\n\nErin Feller: No! It was still tapping on the glass when I left. It keeps smiling at me.  I'm upstairs in my office.  It has a lock. \n*Caller tries to calm her dog.*\n\n\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay Erin - \n\n\n\nErin Feller: It was smiling at me!  And like mouthing words or something but I don't know what. They …. Didn't have eyelids… *Caller whimpers*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay, Erin…. Just stay calm, officers are not far from you. \n\n\n\nErin Feller: I don't understand why - *Caller goes quiet, and the sound of her dog growling can be heard*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Are you there?  \n\n\n\nErin Feller: *whispering* I heard something. I think they're in the house. \n\n\n\nDispatcher: You can stay quiet if you need to.  I'm still on the line. \n\n\n\nErin Feller: It's…. It sounds like *unintelligible* Wait.. *a muffled metallic sound can be heard followed by a scream and barking*\n\n\nErin Feller: Oh my God! *Caller screams and sounds to be running. A door slams.* \n\n\n\nErin Feller: Ginger! Come here! *Sobbing* \n\n\nDispatcher: Erin? Are you alright? \nCan you tell me what's happening? \n\n\n\n*A full minute passes with no response to dispatcher's questions. Caller can be heard trying to calm her dog.*\n\n\nDispatcher: Erin? \n\n\n\n\nErin Feller: I'm in…. Hello? \n\n\n\nDispatcher: I'm here. \n\n\n\nErin Feller: I'm in the downstairs bathroom.  Where are the police? *Caller is out of breath*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: They're 4 minutes out Erin.  They're doing their best to get to you as fast as they can.  Just try and remain calm. You're doing great.  \n\n\n\nErin Feller: It got inside the fucking vent. I\n…. God..\n\n\nDispatcher: Erin, did you say the person was inside your vents? Can you clarify what you mean? \n\n\n\nErin Feller:  *Caller is speaking quietly* Like the fucking vent the heat comes out of! I heard something moving in there and I bent down to flip open the vent and saw that white face staring out! *Caller sounds to be hyperventilating*\n\n\n\nDispatcher: How big are your air vents Erin? \n\n\n\nErin Feller: The standard size! I don't know.  6 inches or so.  Not big enough for a fucking person to crawl through! But they did…..they did. \n\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Okay. Take deep breaths. Officers are less than 2 minutes out. \n\n\n\nErin Feller: Oh my God… why is it taking so long? \n\n\n\n\nDispatcher: Just keep the door locked and -\n\n\n\nErin Feller: I think….*Caller goes quiet*\n\n\n\nErin Feller: *whispering* I hear it moving around in the vents! *Unintelligible* tapping on it.\n\n\n\nDispatcher: It's okay to remain quiet.  I'm here. Do you have anything you can use as a weapon?\n\n\n\n\nErin Feller: *whispering*  i...have the towel bar. *Crying*\n\n\n\nErin Feller: *screams* Oh my God….it's poking its fingers through! \n\n\n\n*A door slams, followed by screams and high pitch laughter. Caller sounds to be running. Laughing grows louder, almost mechanical in nature. Call ends.*\n\n\n\n\n*Officers McQuery and Pape arrived on scene approximately 56 seconds later. The front door was open prior to their arrival and there were obvious signs of a struggle throughout the home.*\n\n*Officers called out to Ms Feller but did not get a response. Officer Pape found the dog in the downstairs laundry room staring into the air vent and whimpering. The dog had obvious cuts and scrapes around its snout and paws from attempting to enter the air vent.*\n\n\n\n*Traces of white makeup were found on most of the windows in the home, on the inside of the glass.* \n\n\n*After a thorough investigation officers collected blood and hair samples inside 4 of the vents throughout the home, along with fingernails that were embedded in one of the grates. More traces of white paint were found inside all of the vents in the home. Hair samples match the hair length and color of Ms Feller's.*\n\n\n*It is noted that all of the vents in the home were measured at \"6x10\" much too small for a person to move through or even fit inside.*\n\n\n*To date Ms Feller is still missing and there is a reward for any information leading to her whereabouts.*",

        "text": "  \n\nMother.\n\nMy baby isn’t mine. \n\nThat’s all I could think as I lay in bed listening to the monitor. I can hear her breathing down the baby monitor tucked in her cot. Tom was in there with her, but for the baby’s own safety. To keep it away from me. \n\nI brought her back from the hospital only a month ago. It’s such a confusing place, all those little humans wrapped up in blue and pink blankets with a name scribbled onto a whiteboard at the bottom of the cot. I stared at her. Directed to her by the nurse. Tom was thrilled, putting his hands on my shoulder and holding me close. He was smiling, but yet I felt this complete disconnection. \n\nWhen the nurse handed me the release forms like I was recovering my car that had been impounded for overstaying the parking meter in downtown Manhattan. I stared at the forms, and it was as if the ink was moving around the paper. I couldn’t focus. All I could see was that sea of pink and blue in front of me, and the feeling of that something was terribly wrong.\n\n“Come on, Ellie,” Tom said. “Let’s take our daughter home.”\n\n*Our daughter*. \n\nIt sounds crazy. I know it sounds crazy. Maybe it’s the sleepless nights. Maybe it’s the being stuck in the house all day listening to it scream in the back room as I stare vacantly at the grey walls I have been trapped in the last month. \n\nThe loving touch of Tom’s skin has since relinquished, and he sleeps on the floor by its cot. He says he doesn’t trust me to be around it. He doesn’t trust me because he has seen the way I have been looking at it. \n\n“That’s not our baby,” I said once at the dinner table while Tom fed it formula. My breasts were aching, leaking through my clothing. How sick is that? A baby cries and the mother’s breasts lactate. It’s like something has invaded my body and is controlling it. \n\n“You’re disgusting,” he said, taking it into his arms and moving away from me. “You need to go and see a doctor.” He passed me some leaflets to help with post-natal depression. But I threw them away. I wasn’t going to see a doctor. I wasn’t going to love it. My body was betraying me. My home felt like a tomb. My husband was distant. Was I going insane? Was something happening to me? \n\nThe way it only screamed when I was alone with it. How it wouldn’t eat when I forced myself to feed it. The way I saw it sneer when no one else was looking. It was trying to drive me insane. It wanted Tom all to itself. It is trying to slowly kill me. My child, my *real* child is still in that hospital somewhere, alone and abandoned. Someone has switched the names, the cots or the paperwork. \n\nI hear breathing on the monitor go silent. It pulls me from the darkness of my thoughts, and I put my ear to the small radio. Through the haze, I hear a whisper that makes my skin crawl. \n\n“Mother…” \n\nLike pulled up by a winch, I erect out of bed and walk along the hallway and stand at the foot of the nursery where it sleeps. Tentatively, I hover my fingers over the doorknob. I could hear something whispering inside. Something hissing, like if a serpent could speak. Its language abyssal, the feeling of the dark, of the dread that surrounds me forcing its way down my throat where it lands in my stomach growing cysts that swell and burst with tiny bugs that ravage my organs, ready to eat the backs of my eyes. \n\nI grab the door and turn it. The whispering stops. \n\n“What are you doing, Elle?” I turn. Tom is standing on the stairs with a glass of water. \n\n“I heard it talking…” Such a phrase should sound absurd. Insane even. And yet, it’s the truest thing I had ever uttered. \n\n“The baby,” he said. “The baby is asleep. You need to go back to bed.” \n\n“But I heard it talking. It called for me to come to it.” Tom placed his glass down and moved slowly to me. What did he think I was going to do? What *was* I going to do? Only then did I notice the knife in my hand.\n\n“Just come to me,” he said, moving closer. “Pass me the knife and come here.” I studied the blade, the glint of moonlight on the edge and then the look of Tom’s worried face. He was going to stop me. He was going to let it win. \n\nI thrust the door open and stepped into the room. I went to speak, to move to it. But then I felt the cold. A paralysing bite of ice. A feeling of desolation, like standing in the artic at the foot of the great endless void. \n\nThen I saw it standing by the crib. \n\nLike holding onto an electrified fence, the sight of it pulsed fear through my body. It immobilised me, like staring into the eyes of a Basilisk. Something indescribable, only that of shadow. Its aura elicited one feeling. Malice. \n\nThe baby cried, splitting the sound of my heartbeat that thumped in my ear. The thing turned, its eyes a hellish glow of yellow. Its mouth opened, stretching into a long black maw, its teeth like razors. \n\n“Mother,” it hissed in the thrum of chaotic discords like a siren from the dead. \n\nAnd then they were gone.",

        "text": " THUMP!\n\nThe noise jars me, even though I was already lying awake, an unfortunate side effect of not having yet installed window shades in the bedroom. It’s on the list. Moonlight streams through the window. awake, even though I’ve become a light sleeper lately. Tonight more than usual from the moonlight streaming into the bedroom window. Frank, the basement contractor, said that these noises were probably a result of the house re-settling due to the work he had done. Not common, but apparently not that unusual. Well, at least the basement’s dry now.\n\nI moved into this farmhouse six months ago. It’s way on the outskirts of Boston, and some of the homes date back to well before the revolution. Fortunately, this one is from the late 1800s. Old enough to have a ton of character like stained glass windows and the original wide plank flooring, but not old enough to be a money pit like some of the older homes. Or so I thought. Still, I managed to get a great price. Something about “Stigmatized property”, though my realtor assured me that it was just a bunch of rumors. As it is, I’m only superstitious if it involves the color green, if you get my drift. \n\nLike any old house it’s had issues. The basement wall would have a trickle of water on the uphill side almost every month. Oddly enough, it didn’t seem to be directly linked to thunderstorms or the weather. Fortunately, I found a great contractor. Frank ended up digging up that entire side of the house to re-seal the wall, and found what looks like a root cellar from a much, much older home. With these old neighborhoods, sometimes a house would burn down, and they would just build on top of the rubble. In this case this little room is nearly adjacent to my basement, and Frank figured that water was pooling inside, then seeping through. \n\nFrank gave me the option of connecting it to my basement, but I thought it was a creepy little space, even though it looked like it might even have served as a playroom at one time, with what looked like crayon scribblings on the walls. The red stone floor was covered with scraps of blackened paper, candles and broken glass, and there was a vague odor of decay or rotten eggs.  Frank pointed out the piles of small bones and claw or teeth marks covering the walls and suggested that rats or possums might have become trapped in there at one point. That pretty much settled it – I had him block it off and make sure my basement wall was sealed properly with 2 coats of Hydro-Seal. That was over 2 weeks ago. Well, that appears to have been when the house started making its noises. Frank said he had heard of houses re-settling when a foundation is disturbed.\n\nThe noises seem louder tonight. Sharper and more frequent. I think I hear a faucet dripping slowly. I guess I’ll check the kitchen sink tomorrow, or is it coming from the shower here next to my bedroom?  You never know with these old houses.",

        "text": "Recently me and my cousin started getting into Urbex and we were looking for some place big to explore, some friends of ours told us about a big abandoned shopping mall in the middle of big city that seemed pretty exiciting so we wait till night took our gear and went on to explore it.\n\nWhen we got there was something odd about that place, it felt diferent from other places we explored  other then the liminal creepyness this places tend to have, however we couldn't put our fingers over what give that creepy aura. We got in anyway and we wish we didn't.\n\nInside the mall we were still feeling that threatening aura, but we were having too much fun exploring the old abondoned shops and structures to care about that as we explored we came across something chilling, in the office part of one shop one of the doors was closed and from underneath it the soft flickering light that comes from candles. I still tried to rationalise it, maybe be a hobo couple love den... we just have to go back without they noticing us. But there was no noise coming from there and my curiosity would not let me simply just go, so I put my ear against the door and... nothing my cousin told me that was enough we should go but i decided to check out when I opened the door there where 9 people standing around a pentagram  in the ground with full body cloaks. We didn't even tought about and ran as fast as we could and they followed by walking after us when we took our eyes of them and look foward there was a big man with a club so  I  kicked one of the windows out of its frame we were on the 3rd floor so it was a big drop my cousin jumped first when I went to jump my shirt got grabbed the man caught up to me he hit me in the head with the club knoking me out.\n\nI woke up in different place inside some kind of old shed tied to a chair without my shirt and weird symbols drawn in my torso and a big scar on my chest which is stiched that look like they were made by a professional in an hospital, I had many questions but didn't want to fuck around and find out.\n\nI  kinda stand up and ran backwards to the wall to break the chair, then i tried the door and uh unloked. I was in a farm in the middle of nowhere I walked for about two hours before getting somewhere people could ride me to the hospital.\n\nThe police went to check and they just found my cousin things whitout him there, as for me I went to the doctor and his diagnose weirded me out to the bone, they swapped my heart with another one and after the doctor took a dna sample, it is my cousin heart, WTF!!! we still looking for my cousing and the motherfuckers who did that, I hope he is alive.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago now, but I still remember it a little too vividly. \n\nSome backstory... \n\nI used to work as a front desk agent at a hotel while i was in college. Since a few people had quit, I was occasionally asked to do the night audit shift (11 pm - 7 am). At first, it was a pretty easy job where I did work for like an hour and then had to find creative ways to stay awake. There were occasionally creepy sounds and whatnot, but even though no one else worked with me, nothing really bothered me (with the exception of a freaking fax that came from the hot tub between 4 and 5 am to tell me the chlorine level was too high, that scared the hell out of me the first time).\n\nMain story..\n\nAfter doing this a few months, I had grown pretty comfortable with it until one night. At around 1 a.m., I got a phone call, which was very unusual. Since it was so late, I didn't bother to check if it was coming from a room or if it was an external number since I assumed that it was a guest that needed something. This was the conversation:\n\nMe: \"Hello, this is OP. How can I help you?\"\nCaller: \"Are you working alone?\"\nMe: \"Yes sir,  I do the night audit. How can I help you?\"\nCaller (with a lower almost sensual voice): \"Mmm, good. I'm lonely too, can you keep me company?\"\nMe: \"Sorry sir, but I am still working.\"\n\nCaller hangs up.\n\nI was pretty creeped out after I saw that the call came from OUTSIDE the hotel. I was on the second floor dropping off bills to guests when the call happened. I then couldn't remember if I had locked the front door and started psyching myself out. I immediately bolted down the hallway to get downstairs to try and check when the phone rang again. I picked it up, and this was the entire conversation:\n\nMe: \"Front desk, how can I help you?\"\nCaller: \"I'm still here if you're lonely.\"\nMe (getting anxious): \"Sorry, but I need to work -\"\nCaller: \"Mmmm. How about you do some work for me?\"\n\nI hung up and double-checked all the doors to ensure they were locked. After ensuring that I was at least locked in, I paced around for a while, trying to figure out what to do. I didn't know who to call or what to do since the exchnages between the caller and I would spund ridiculous or made up to someone else. After sitting and shaking for a while, I finally called the police. The responder was super helpful and said that these calls are actually somewhat common (which sounds more terrifying to me).\n\nLater on, the police came through the premises twice that night and luckily found nothing. I had no trouble staying up that night. When my manager saw me the next day when I got off shift, I couldn't even tell him what happened since it was so terrifying. I did, however, stop doing night audit.",

        "text": "I narrowly escaped, though definitely not unscathed. One attacked me first, clawing deep ripping away flesh while I screamed uncontrollably. The second fought the first to get pieces of me. I remember feeling its rows of sharp teeth sinking in down to the bone and yanking. \n\n\nI had a strange sensation of something pulling free but had no time to think about it before one of them had ripped my chest open. I prayed it wasn't too deep. I wanted to live. My hopes were being dashed faster and faster. The second one took my ear off like it was never attached to begin with… such ease. \n\n\nThe next 20 minutes were a blur as I was in and out of conciseness but I remember seeing them fight each other over something long and bloody about a foot away from me. I would have screamed if I could because when it finally dawned on me the pulling sensation I felt earlier was my now severed leg, I totally lost it. That's why I thought I was hallucinating when I saw Kyla.\n\n\nThere she was, about 200 feet away. She was limping heavily, you could see the stark white bone of her knee poking through her flesh contrasted by the night sky. I looked at her harder because something seemed off… She was missing one eye, her bottom lip and she had been partially scalped…  That beautiful raven hair soaked in blood…\n\n\nShe held a rifle in one hand. I was so sure that I was hallucinating. One squirrel had given up fighting for my severed leg after I heard a wicked scream from the beast and saw it was missing one eye. Good, I thought. You deserved that. I should have never let that thought escape because it turned right back on me as the other consumed my leg greedily.\n\n\nIt only managed to bite into my arm hard before I heard a loud bang. The creature made a horrendous sound as it whipped it's head around to see Kyla with the shotgun in hand. She'd been knocked back against the tree from the recoil. I was so afraid for her. She was already injured so badly and there was no way a shotgun was going to take one of these beasts down let alone two.\n\n\nI cried out in both agony and fear. I heard another shot ring out. Then a third that whizzed past the one ear I had left as the beast tried to run past me. I yelped but couldn't hear myself. The second best trampled me while trying to run, it smashed my head hard into the dirt and that's when it all went black.\n\n\nThe next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with tubes and chords coming from everywhere on my body. The light was so bright I thought I'd died at first. The smell of hospital disinfect was ripe in the air and all the machines were going off but I could barely hear them. My head was pounding. I groaned. I could taste the saline they were pumping through my veins. Yep, I was alive.\n\n\nIt took me a second to orientate myself and that's when I remembered everything. That's when I started to freak out. I looked around the room and saw nobody so I searched desperately for the nurse call button. Two of them rushed in. \"Laisa, get the doctor, he's awake!\" I still barely heard her. I was afraid I had lost my hearing from that shot whizzing by. The thought was momentary as I was way more worried about Kyla. It was my first question.\n\n\n\"Where is Kyla? Is she okay?!\" The nurse tilted her head and had a look of sympathy on her face… \"She's here in the hospital, she's okay but… she's suffered some pretty rough injuries, the poor thing,\" she told me. I didn't care, I wanted to see her. \n\n\n\"Can I see her please?!\" The nurse once again tilted her head and told me I'd have to ask the doctor first, that he would be in soon. The doctor came in shortly after and he told me it was amazing I survived at all and I never would have had it not been for Kyla's intervention. I asked what happened to those beasts and he looked at me funny and told me she said it was a bear attack.\n\n\nKyla was a story sight but she was still so beautiful to me. I didn't think it was possible but I loved her even more now. We almost died and I decided I wasn't going to hide it anymore, I was going to tell her how I felt. But that could wait just a little bit longer… She opened her eyes and tried her best to smile.\n\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" I asked. \"Like I was torn apart by two squirrels from hell.\" She let out a little giggle at that. Well, at least she still had her sense of humor. They did the best they could to make her look like she had before. Same for me. But we will always carry the scars… and missing pieces of us.\n\n\nI just had to know what happened after I blacked out, were they gone forever? Did she kill them? Did they get away? I had so many thoughts jumbled I didn't know what to ask first. I settled with, \"are they dead?\" She looked at me with a vacant stare and a look of sadness on her face, \"no Chris, they got away, and I've been doing some research..\"\n\n\nI didn't like where this was going… \"What did you find?\" I asked meekly. \"Well it seems like they are summoned from Hell… and uh… they come back every 13 years…\" My stomach dropped to my feet. I didn't know how to process this. Who summoned them, why had we not seen them before? Why us? And they were dining back?!! I just laid my head in my hands and sobbed a little.\n\n\n\n\nIt's been 5 months since it came. Autumn is far behind us and so are those freak squirrels. I finally told Kyla how I felt during our long stint in physical rehab. She really does amaze me more and more everyday. She surprisingly felt the same. We've decided to take it slow. We're both going through some intense therapy. PTSD is real. I can't be anywhere near trees or anywhere a regular squirrel normally hangs out.\n\n\nDon't worry though, we have years to prepare and believe me we will. I've already started finding all materials I can on the dark arts related to summoning hellish creatures. I haven't found the right one yet, but we aren't giving up. We're also trying to find any and everything we can arm ourselves with that may help us in the fight.\n\n\nWe're a sad sight, a few limbs missing and huge battle scars but we are determined. I also got my hearing back! I'm so glad for that because I'm going to need it. I can't rely on Kyla alone. She already saved my ass once. Wish us luck! ",

        "text": "\"When you conduct an experiment you cannot test the entire population, you have to take a sample. Big enough to get valid results but small enough so you can manage the data and get enough volunteers.\n\nWell, in this case, the participants aren't always volunteers but they usually do get a nice payoff. Mostly in values that they cherish. For some, it's money, fortune, health, you name it. They mostly live without fear, especially when they are at least a little naive.\n\nThere is also a mixture of different treatments. Most don't seem realistic but some really are. \n\nThe town you're from is an example. There are no supernatural influences, even if the people might believe it.\"\n\nThis was supposed to be a therapy session but the psychologist did most of the talking. She didn't seem very competent in her job, smart sure but also kind of wrong. Not because of her appearance though. Her hair was neatly put up, she was wearing a grey cardigan and glasses with milky white frames. \n\nKind of how someone might dress after looking up what a therapist looks like.\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"I'm not *from* that town. The others are. I only lived there for a week or something.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Or something? You don't know how long you lived there?\" \n\n\"You just held that whole monologue about experiments but aren't you a therapist?\"\n\nShe smiled and put her pen down.\n\n\"Don't answer questions with questions or we'll be here forever. But I'll answer this one for you. First of all, psychology is a wide spectrum, if you want to understand humans, you need research as well. As for me specifically, I don't conduct them. I just know about them. And I suppose you know that I'm not a therapist in the usual sense. Do you even know what a real therapist is?\"\n\nI don't think she meant to sound condescending but she sure did. Still, when she talked about the reason I was there I felt a shiver down my spine. \n\n\"Jeez, I'm not an idiot.\"\n\n\"Oh no I'm sorry, I suppose what I really meant was do you remember what a therapist is?\"\n\n\"Yes. I remember a lot. Well, it's getting more by the day.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Can you tell me your name?\"\n\n\"[Charlie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zxjkmw/every_year_a_new_family_joins_our_town_something/),\" I hissed.\n\n\"You're angry. That's not bad. I would be too. How old are you, Charlie?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\nShe pulled a face in response. I'm not sure if it was showing disgust or if she felt empathy for a split second. \n\n\"Almost 18. Yikes.\"\n\nI nodded. We both knew what that meant. My parents had willingly joined a cult that could murder any adult whenever they want and they decided to take me with them to this community just a year before I became an adult.\n\nThis could've been my last year on this earth if our neighbor didn't help me to escape that insane town. I wouldn't have made it on my own and my parents had enough drugs and other means to keep me there. \n\nI wonder how brainwashed they must be to willingly *choose* to go to a place like that. And while I will hate my parents forever for doing this to us, I'm also afraid of what will happen to them. Will they be punished because I ran away?\n\n\"How did Cha- sorry, Lucia's dad find you?\" I asked her after the room had been filled with some silence.\n\n\"He didn't. I found you. We're pretty good at knowing where all the different residents are at most times. I mean, when an escape feels as easy as yours did, there's usually something or someone behind it, making sure things go smoothly.\"\n\nI felt a cold sweat forming.\n\n\"Why would you do that? How are you connected to that place?\" \n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Because it's one of our samples. A very self-sufficient one until now, but you disrupted it and we want to understand how you were able to do so. Don't worry, I won't snitch on you. If the people of Agsbury knew they'd come for you and shred you into pieces and bury you deep down or throw your corpse into their lake. I'm not here to meddle, only to understand and observe. In all those years nobody has ever gotten out of Agsbury. And not because there is strict security or borders around town. They haven't been necessary until now because the people there accept living like that. They don't want to leave. They think they need to *deserve* it to live there and do anything for it. And if the other residents decide that it's time for them to die, well then that's how it has to go, you know?\"\n\nI still wasn't sure if I could trust this woman but what other chance did I have? We couldn't go back to my old home, we couldn't try to contact anyone from our past lives because-\n\nWhy couldn't we? \n\nI tried to remember what exactly led us to this place, this therapist's office. \n\n\"Where are the people I was with? Lucia, Benny, their dad?\"\n\nShe tapped her finger on the small table next to her seat. \n\n\"I will be honest with you, Charlie. Because I want you to be honest as well, alright? The girl and her brother are fine, I suppose. They are having conversations similar to ours right now. The girl did however have a little outburst after we informed her about what happened. She was screaming around, I'm surprised you didn't hear her.\"\n\nI gave her a questioning look, both curious and scared. \n\nShe took a deep breath.\n\n\"Well, the man committed suicide. Jumped out of the window while a colleague was getting him a glass of water. You're lucky it was on the other side of the building, blood and body parts everywhere.\"\n\nShe moved her body in an overdramatic shiver while I felt like throwing up. The man who saved my life had just ended his own life and she was talking like these things happen every day. \n\nI stared at the ground, not sure what to make of that news. I thought about Lucia. She'd been through so much already and now the only person who stepped up for her was dead.\n\nBut suddenly my feelings turned into something different. Fear. Why would I believe anything she was saying? If they were working with the people from Agsbury, those psychopathic cult members, they would kill us as well and ship our bodies back to that town so they could use them as a part of their disgusting ceremonies or whatever. \n\nI looked around the room for a way to escape. Maybe if I was fast enough I could run to the door but who says there isn't someone waiting for me on the outside? I couldn't try the window because we were far too high up. \n\n\"I know what you're thinking. I see your eyes move around, you know.\"\n\n\"You killed him, didn't you?\" I whispered. \n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"No, Charlie. I told you I'd be honest. This man is the very first person who willingly left Agsbury and took three children with him. Do you know how badly I wanted to have a glimpse inside his brain? And I mean his thoughts, not the goo that got spread all over the concrete.\"\n\nI really hoped the person talking to Lucia and Benny wasn't like this woman.\n\n\"Why would he escape just to kill himself? It doesn't make any sense,\" I mumbled.\n\n\"Well, the spell was lifted. Not an actual spell but you know what I mean. His perception of his former life. This man had been a part of this 'cult-like community' for many years. Years in which he helped to murder at least a dozen people. It's really surprising that he snapped out of his mind at all, as I said nobody has ever left Agsbury before. But well, with a clear mind, he remembered everything he did. This is just my interpretation but wouldn't you wanna kill yourself as well?\" \n\n\\--\n\nAfter minutes of silence, she got up to get me a glass of water which I didn't drink. She laughed and called me suspicious but at least gave me some time before continuing our conversation. Enough time to make me question how I ended up this way. \n\nMy life hadn't been particularly great all the time. A lot of memories were still hazy but I do know that I didn't have the nicest childhood.\n\nWe moved around a lot. Dad had a gambling addiction, mum had a very difficult temper. We didn't have many relatives, the ones we did, couldn't stand my parents. I spent most of my time alone, hiding wherever I could inside the different shitty apartments we moved to before Agsbury, with books. Books I hardly remember now. \n\nI guess a part of me can understand that my parents were susceptible to the influence of some cult promising them a perfect life. Although I'm not sure how they got over the 'we regularly kill people to nourish our earth' part. \n\nDistracted by my own thoughts I didn't realize that the therapist had been watching me this entire time. When I caught her gaze I realized that she wasn't even blinking, just staring. I remembered that she'd casually talked about some towns being supernatural earlier but shrugged it off. \n\nDid I have a wrong view of the world or was everybody I met insane? \n\nWell, except for Lucia. She was like me, even though she was trapped in that hell town so much longer than me. And now her dad had killed himself after finally saving her. \n\n\"Don't you ever blink?\" I burst out.\n\nFinally, the therapist closed her eyes for a fraction of a second.\n\n\"Didn't wanna miss anything. To be honest, I really wanted to talk to one of the others. You were in that town for such a short time, it hasn't changed you as much as them but I would like to learn as much as I can.\"\n\n\"You said something about small towns being targeted. Who is targeting them? Who are you working for?\" \n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to talk about it. Trust me, there are things happening at the moment that you don't even want to think-\"\n\nSuddenly we were interrupted by a loud alarm. I had to shelter my ears with my hands because it felt like my eardrums would explode any second. A red light filled the room in which the therapist suddenly appeared a lot more frightened.\n\n\"What's happening?\" I shouted.\n\nShe moved my hands from my ears and screamed \"Stay here!\"\n\nThen she ran towards the door and disappeared outside. \n\nMy heart started racing- my fast pulse, the red right, the ringing. It was all too much but I knew I had to act. Still, I couldn't get my body to move.\n\nUntil I saw her bursting in through the door that the therapist had forgotten to close.\n\n\"Lucia?\" I said but of course, she couldn't hear me. \n\nShe said something that looked like \"come\" or \"run\", so I jumped up and followed her down the hallway. \n\nWhen I got to her, she grabbed my arm and shouted \"we have to find Benny!\"\n\nWe continued down the long hallway and tried to open every door we came past. Some were surprisingly unlocked but with no people inside. Other doors were locked, like one that read **Parasite Lab**. We ran further until we reached the door to a staircase and followed the stairs down. There were no more doors on our way leading us to different levels of the building. I jumped down two or three stairs at once and finally the two of us, completely out of breath, had made it to the final level. \n\nAs I pushed open the glass door at the bottom which wasn't locked either, we finally breathed in the fresh air. \n\nLucia took a step back.\n\n\"What are you doing? We need to go NOW!\" I took a few rapid breaths. \"I don't know what they told *you* but these people are not trying to help us.\" \n\n\"I don't care, Benny is still in there.\"\n\nShe was right. But I also knew that it didn't matter so I grabbed Lucia's arm and pulled her away from the building which had looked very isolated from the outside but as we walked down the empty road, we started seeing more houses and buildings. \n\nA town?\n\nSurprisingly, Lucia didn't fight it and we kept walking toward civilization.  \n\nI suppose she was thinking the same thing I was.\n\n\"I'm certain we'll see him again. And the people inside that building as well.\" I said after we'd gotten further away. \n\nShe nodded. \n\n\"Yeah, our escape was far too [easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/).\"",

        "text": " I've never won anything before. That is until I got a strange letter in the mail one day. It was a black and silver envelope with no return address. I opened it and this is what followed:\n\n \"Congratulations! You have been chosen from the entire world population to participate in a life changing experience. Included is a one-way plane ticket to London. An email has also been sent, please confirm. We look forward to seeing you. - Global Ranking Systems Inc.\" \n\nUhh, okay. This can't be real, I thought. Surely, it's some kinda scam. I opened up my email, and sure enough, I had a new message from the same company. I didn't reply. Instead, I decided to do some research on the company. A quick google search brought up nothing. Strange. I dug a little deeper and couldn't find a single shred of information about the company. Definitely a scam. \n\nOne week passed, and I continued to get the same emails every day. Finally, after 10 days, I received a different email. It read as follows: \"We still have not received a confirmation from you. As a further incentive, we are willing to pay you for your time. $10,000 when you arrive in London, and an additional $40,000 upon completion. We hope this will be sufficient for your time. Though, we think the experience will be far more valuable. Your flight is scheduled for this Friday. Please confirm.\"\n\n I really needed that money. I don't think I'd forgive myself if I turned it down. If nothing else, it was a free trip to London. I confirmed, and the next thing I knew I landed at Heathrow Airport.\n\n When I exited the plane, a man was waiting for me. He was holding a sign with my name on it. I approached him and he simply handed me an envelope which contained another plane ticket and $10,000 in cash. He walked away before I could ask him anything. The ticket's destination was Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Mongolia. It was departing in 25 minutes. I made my way to the terminal. When I reached the terminal, the plane was already boarding. I paced back and forth. Did I really wanna do this? What the hell could be in Mongolia? I should've just taken the ten grand and went home... I really wish I did. \n\nBut something compelled me to get on that plane. I handed my ticket to the woman at the counter. She inspected it then gave me a strange look. \"Just a moment.\" She said. She picked up a phone and whispered something I couldn't quite here. She nodded her head a few times then hung up the phone. \"Right this way.\" I was told.  \n\nAs I walked down the boarding tunnel, I heard a man arguing with the woman I just spoke with. I was pleased to discover that I was sitting first class, but I was the only one. The flight was a bit strange. It was eerily quiet. But then again, everything that was happening was kind of strange. It was a 9 hour flight and I ended up sleeping for most of it.\n\n When I landed in Mongolia, another man was waiting for me. I confirmed my identity with my passport and was told to follow him. A black SUV was waiting for us. Before I got in the car, I felt a very subtle tremble in my feet. We drove for hours through the Mongolian wilderness. My driver didn't speak a single word to me. I ended up sleeping for much of the drive but the time I spent awake was actually quite pleasant. I had no idea how beautiful Mongolia was.\n\n About an hour outside our destination, we passed through a small village. It looked like a ghost town. The few locals who were outside quickly retreated indoors as they saw our SUV approaching. Suddenly there was a great rumble, which I could only assume was an earthquake. It only lasted a second or two. I didn't think too much of it at the time but looking back, that brief drive through that small town, the scared locals, the earthquake... it all made sense. \n\nIn the distance, I saw it. It looked like a football stadium, except much larger. It loomed over the flat desert landscape like a black fortress of stone, concrete and steel. There was a long tunnel leading from it to my ultimate destination however: The Cube. The Cube looked more like a modern art installation than any functioning place of business. It stood about 5-6 stories tall and it appeared to be windowless, I couldn't tell if the building was clear or silver with the sun hitting it. Ten flags circled the front: USA, UK, Russia, China Switzerland, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and one I had never seen before. It was all red with a thick black circle and a small diamond in the center. \n\nWe pulled in and drove up to the entrance. A woman in about her 40's was waiting. I got out and the SUV took off. The woman extended her hand for a shake. \"Hello there, I'm Dr. Anna.\" She had an accent I couldn't quite place, but she seemed friendly enough. \"You're last to arrive. Let's go inside, the others are waiting.\" She said. I followed her inside, but I couldn't help but wonder, what others?\n\n The inside of The Cube was quite stunning. It was a literal oasis in the desert. There was large cliff waterfall and stream, and countless wild plants and flowers. There were even birds flying around and it seemed as though they could fly in and out through the glass walls surrounding the place. Oddly enough though, there were no people. \n\nI followed Dr. Anna around to the other side of the cliff. There was an elevator waiting. We got in and began our descent. We fell for at least two whole minutes, at great speed too as I needed to brace myself. How deep was this place, I wondered. \n\nThe elevator finally came to a stop and when the doors opened, I was greeted to a sight straight out of a movie. Bright, white fluorescent lights illuminated a very modern looking office space. Cubicles, glass-walled offices and people walking around, some wearing formal dress and others in lab coats. It looked too clean, too prepared. It all just seemed a bit off. Every 50 feet or so there were immense charcoal colored stone columns, at least 20 feet in diameter, that seemed to be bearing the weight of the earth above.\n\n I continued to follow Dr. Anna down corridors and through offices. Everywhere we went, people would shoot glares my way, never making eye contact though, just like the people in the village. Then it happened, another \"earthquake.\" I asked Dr. Anna what it was, but she didn't even acknowledge me. \n\nWe finally came to a large blast door. Dr. Anna scanned her ID card, entered a code and finally used a hand scanner. The door opened slowly and we entered. This area looked a bit different. It was a large square room, or rather a small warehouse, probably ten thousand square feet with a large circular glass room in the middle. The glass room was divided into four separate rooms, each containing machines and equipment and some stuff I'd never seen before. There was a second floor above the circled the perimeter. There were less people here, and all of them wore lab coats. There was some sort of observation deck on the second floor that looked like a skybox you'd see at a sporting arena. The windows were blacked out. \n\nThree other individuals were waiting. These people clearly didn't work here. I quickly learned they were other \"winners.\" I hadn't even considered there would be others. I thought I was the only one. There was The Frenchman, the woman from Japan, and the man from South Africa.\n\n Dr. Anna spoke: \"Thank you all for your patience, and on behalf of everyone here and abroad, I would like to congratulate each one of you on being selected for this once in a lifetime opportunity. We are The Horizon Group, the world's leader in advanced research and development. Each of you have been chosen to participate and bare witness to the cutting edge work being performed here. What you are about to witness is unlike anything you've seen before. Simply put, we make the impossible a reality.\" \n\nEach of the three members were taken away into back rooms separately after having a brief word with Dr. Anna. She then told me to follow a gentleman to the blacked out observation area on the second floor. There was a man dressed in what looked like a very expensive suit waiting in the room. There were some documents on a table, a NDA or non-disclosure agreement. I was told to sign. I asked what I was even supposed to be doing. The man never looked at me, he only responded, \"You watch.\" I signed it. \n\nNow, I'm fully aware the events which I'm about to recount from this point forward are going to be difficult, if not impossible, to accept as truth. I wouldn't believe a word of it either. And to be entirely honest, most of what I saw I can hardly even describe. I was given no explanation for anything I witnessed, and for what I saw last... Well, I don't think an explanation exists. But bare with me please, I need to share this with someone... anyone. My sanity is slipping rapidly.\n\n EXPERIMENT #1 - THE FRENCHMAN \n\nHis clothing was changed. He went from wearing a nice looking business suit to a grey, two-piece jumpsuit. He was being assisted by a man and a woman. He looked a bit \"out of it\" and couldn't walk straight. Did they drug him? They brought him under a large, black-metallic archway. It seemed to be made of a single solid piece and was integrated directly into the floor. It started out thin, about 8 or so inches thick and gradually grew to about 3 feet thick at the top and stood about 9 or 10 feet tall. Above it were a series of white and silver wires and tubes. They all ran up the ceiling then down one of the corners of the room into the ground. \n\nThe man and woman left the room, then a voice came over the speaker and told the man to remain very still for a moment. The voice then said something in French which I didn't understand. After a few moments, the voice told the Frenchman to walk forward. He took two steps before breaking the threshold of the archway. The entire opening of the arch filled with a very strange looking substance. It looked like a mix between a gas and a liquid and it was the same color as the archway itself. He disappeared for a single instant before reappearing directly behind the archway. He put his hand on his chest, but his entire abdomen looked caved in. I have no clue what exactly happened or where the man \"went\".\n\n As I was trying to piece it together, the Frenchman coughed up a mouthful of black blood and fainted into the greyish substance of the archway. His body disappeared before it hit the floor. This time he didn't return.\n\n I turned to the man in the room with me but he was gone. I went to the door but found it locked. I shouted at the CCTV camera in the room, demanding an answer to what just happened. A voice came over the speaker again, this time it sounded like Dr. Anna. \"Experiment 1: Failure. Proceed with experiment 2.\" \n\nEXPERIMENT #2 - THE JAPANESE WOMAN \n\nAnother man and woman brought her out into one of the rooms. There was a bed and a bunch of medical equipment and life support machines and what I can only assume was a medical doctor. The doctor was preparing a series of syringes. The man and woman helped the Japanese girl onto the bed and proceeded to strap her down much like you'd see for violent patients or criminals. She didn't seem to mind. In fact, she looked to be in the same state of mind as the Frenchman was. \n\nThe man and woman stood near the door with their backs to her. Another doctor entered the room and spoke briefly with the other doctor before leaving. The doctor hooked the Japanese woman up to some of the machines to read her vitals including her pulse and blood pressure. He then took one of the syringes and injected it into the woman's arm. He took a step back and crossed his arms. \n\n After a few moments the machines started to beep and I could see that her pulse and blood pressure were dropping quickly. About 20 seconds later, she flatlined. The doctor waited another minute or so before unhooking the equipment. He then got the other syringe. He injected her straight in the side of the neck, and took three steps back. He looked nervous this time. \n\nHer eyes opened briefly then closed. A few seconds later, they opened again. She turned to look at the man and woman that brought her in. They still had their backs to her. She slowly turned her head to look at the doctor, but he too turned his back to her before she could make eye contact. She began to move her head from side to side in a very slow and deliberate motion, closing her eyes tight and reopening them a bit wider each time. \n\nI moved right up against the glass to try for a closer look. Her head cocked back to an impossible position, and she locked eyes with me and let out a terrifying screech. Could she see me through the glass? The windows were blacked out. She was changing rapidly. She no longer looked human. The veins in her neck were bulging and black, her eyes were blood red and dripping with a grey liquid. And her neck... I'll never forget it. Her neck extended to allow her forehead to touch her shoulder blades.\n\n After a minute or so, her entire body began to change shape. It looked like her bones were growing larger with her skin tightening around them until eventually her bones ripped through revealing a greyish black skeleton. She stopped moving and screaming. She never broke eye contact with me.\n\n I stood there alone in that room, horrified and confused. What the hell was this place? What had I gotten myself into? And was it just a matter of time before I met a similar fate? I just wanted to go home. \n\nThe familiar sound of Dr. Anna's voice came back over the loudspeaker: \"Experiment 2: Success. Proceed with experiment 3.\" \n\nEXPERIMENT #3 - THE SOUTH AFRICAN MAN \n\nThe man from South Africa entered the final room. He was wearing the same jumpsuit, but he also had on an odd looking skull cap that had some wires running from the top of his head into his back. Nobody was in the room he entered, and he wasn't being escorted by anyone.\n\n There was only a large cylindrical capsule with a thick blast door that was already open. There was a large digital clock on the front of the door. The clock ran to 4 decimal places past \"seconds\". And much like the strange archway from the other room, there were a series of tubes and wires running from the capsule into the ground. The man walked in to the capsule and closed his eyes.\n\n Just then, there was another \"earthquake.\" This time it was far more intense and lasted for the longest minute of my life. I could hear some sirens going off but the door to the room was still locked. When the ground shaking ceased, I looked out into the room but the man was gone. I have no idea what happened to him. \n\nOnce again, Dr. Anna's voice rang loud over the speaker. \"Experiment #3: Failure. Proceed with \"Source\" observation.\" \n\nThe door to the room opened and two people came in to get me. I tried to ask what was happening, but they didn't seem to speak English. They showed me to the elevator. Dr. Anna was waiting for me. We began the ascent back to the surface. We stood for a moment in silence before Dr. Anna spoke up. \"I know you have many questions for me, but I assure you they will all be answered in due time. Your task is nearly complete.\" \n\nWe reached the atrium area and made our way to a small shuttle. The shuttle took us through that long tunnel I saw on my way in. We were going to that monstrous looking black dome. The size of the dome was immense. I would guess at least a mile or more across with the walls of the structure rising hundreds of feet tall. But inside there was only a steel ground cover that filled the entire area inside the dome. \n\nThere was another elevator. I was told to enter, descend to bottom and observe. \"Deep below, you will discover the source which makes everything we do here possible, everything you've witnessed here today. There is still much to be learned from this place if we ever hope to truly control this extraordinary source of energy.\" With that, Dr. Anna got back on the shuttle and left me. \n\nI'm not entirely sure why I decided to get in that elevator and descend down into the unknown. I guess I had already come so far that I figured, why not. Not to mention at this point I didn't think I'd be seeing my home again. \n\n To be honest, I wish I had never made it out of that place. Having to live now with what I know is nothing short of torture. \n\nTHE SOURCE \n\nThe elevator was much less sophisticated than the one in the Cube facility. It felt more like a mining lift. It took quite a long time to reach the bottom. When I walked out I was first met with a strong gust of hot air. I couldn't see a thing. I slowly took a few steps and a motion activated light turned on behind me. I seemed to be in some sort of cave. I had always assumed it would be cold in a cave, but the heat was stifling. As my eyes adjusted, I could see some beams of white light shining through the \"ceiling\" way off in the distance. I turned back around and noticed a large circuit breaker box next to the light hanging over the elevator. I threw a large switch and about a dozen large flood lights illuminated the area.\n\n It was then that I began to realize the colossal scale of this place. It wasn't just a mere cave, but a cavern of truly epic proportions. It must've stretched on for miles as there was no end in sight. Some of the walls of the place were lined with that strange greyish-black metallic stone. \n\nBut what was most troubling was the depth. About 20 feet from the elevator, the ground dropped off completely. I picked up a large stone and hurled it into the endless darkness. I waited to hear it hit the bottom, but it never did. \n\nI stood in awe of this place, but I couldn't help but wonder what I was supposed to do here. Just then, the elevator closed and began to make its way back to the surface. I began to panic. There was no button to bring the elevator back. I checked the circuit box but there was nothing. I shouted for help but my voice just echoed into the vast nothingness. What was I going to do now?\n\n I was pacing back and forth when I was struck with a reflective glare noticed some carvings along the wall behind the elevator. It looked like some sort of hieroglyphics, the glare coming from a polished gemstone integrated into the writings. I had no idea what any of it meant. They stretched across the whole wall though until they came to a small door built directly into the stone. The door was made of wood and that strange greyish substance.\n\n Just as I pulled the door open, I heard it. And the very foundation of the earth trembled.  But it wasn't an earthquake, it was a scream, or a cry, or a howl. I have no idea how to describe it because it sounded nothing like anything I'd ever heard. But it came from below. Deep down in that infinite abyss. Loud enough and with so much monumental power to shake the very world. It brought me to my knees and I hunched over, covering my ears as best I could.  I wretched in pain for what felt like an eternity.\n\nIt finally stopped, but I felt paralyzed. I have never felt a stronger, more overwhelming sense of dread and pure hopeless terror in my life. Something was down there, something beyond comprehension, beyond measure. Was that the true \"source.\" Is that what Dr. Anna and these people hope to control? I finally got back to my feet but I was still too afraid to move. My sense of hearing seemed stolen from me and the heat... god the heat was too much to bare.\n\n I clutched the small door and made my way out as quickly as possible. I had no idea where I was going or where this would lead but it seemed to take me away from that horrible cavern and that's all that mattered to me. It felt like hours before I reached the surface. When I finally emerged, it was dark out. I noticed a few small orbs of light in the distance. It was that small town I passed on my way in. It took me about a week before I finally made it back home. \n\nI have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. That non-disclosure agreement means nothing to me now. Even so, who do I go to with this information? It's too unbelievable. And there's no trace of the so called \"Horizon Group.\" The families of the other \"winners\" will never have peace unless I say something.\n\n My mind is fractured. I can't get the sound of that otherworldly, ground shaking scream out of my head. My hearing has not recovered, I hear it during every waking moment. It haunts my dreams. And I just can't help but wonder what such a thing capable of that sound would look like. Do they really think that dome can contain it? Something like that can't be contained... or controlled, or understood. What happens when they dig too deep, or take too much? I don't wanna be around to find out...",

        "text": "I'm going to write more things about my city, as you who read part 1 know, it is cursed by a witch who fulfills wishes in exchange for curses, at least that's what the old man told me. I asked him if there was any way to break the curse but he said he didn't know, he said I had to ask the witch herself who is already dead but her spirit still roams the city at night.\n\n So I continued my day normally until nightfall I told my mother that I was going to sleep at a friend's house to study for a school project and luckily she accepted so when the sun disappeared over the horizon I left the house and went after the damn witch.\n\nPeople report that his spirit appears in various places, sometimes on top of buildings sometimes in dark alleys or in abandoned houses. maybe his spirit still hangs out there because it's his old home, old Joe told me the cabin is in the woods north of town so I walked over there.\n\nWhen I reached the forest everything was silent the only sound was my sneakers stepping on the branches.\n\nI went deeper and deeper into the forest when I saw something at the bottom of the old witch's hut I calmly approached and saw the spirit, a shadow of a woman that almost camouflages itself in the darkness of the night.\n\nI came up calmly and said ''hello are you the wishing witch? how do you break the curse of the town?''She replied:''The only way to break the curse is for the cursed to die.''She said that the cursed was old Joe. cursed being that the one hit was joe. She explained several things, said that her curses have several levels depending on the wish that the person asks.\n\nIf the person asks for a lighter wish, the curse will only hit the cursed person but if the wish is something stronger like curing a serious illness like cancer, the curse will be stronger and will hit everything around the cursed person. she why is she helping me, she said that she suffers from her own curse and her spirit is also trapped in this city.\n\nWell after all these questions and answers I waited for dawn to go back home I got home dead of sleep but I had to go to school I took my backpack and went to school. On the way back I stopped by Joe's house to tell him everything. Joe opened the door, I went into his house and told him everything.\n\nSo he said he was going to kill himself that sentence scared me I didn't think he was going to do that. I told him it could be the witch's lie but he didn't hesitate he told me to go away so I had no choice. I went back to my house wondering if I really should have told him that, that could very well have been a lie from the witch. I went home and continued my day. At night I decided to turn on my TV and I saw news of an old man named Joe who died of poisoning, He really killed himself and it was my fault. I went to sleep and woke up the next day to see if the curse was over I called the TV and, the cases of murders and suicides continue. Why did I trust that damn witch!\n\nI feel guilty I made a poor old man kill himself.\n\nI'll try to find more curse answers maybe I'll find them in the witch's hut I'll go there to see if I can find aything else. I'll update here if I find answers.\n\nHello, it's the next day and I'm going to write this text again. When I was returning from school I went to the witch's hut her spirit was no longer there I entered the hut and there were several things inside like the skulls of other animals, potions and a pentagram there was also an old wooden cabinet I opened and inside were several books books, I took them all and put them in my backpack and took them home. Now I am studying these books, they are written in a strange language.\n\nI tried using the translator but it didn't work so right now I'm searching the Internet to see if I can find anything related to this mysterious language. \n\nI went back and unfortunately I didn't find anything in that language but something very strange happened. Today I was coming back from school there was a boy following me and it was Ryan, the smartest boy in the room I thought it was strange, when I turned around to ask him why he was following me jumped on top of me knocking me to the ground and tried to hang me while he was hanging me he said: ''give me back my books you little brat'' Luckily a person passing by helped me and took Ryan off of me.\n\nAfter that Ryan ran off I thought it was very strange he said to return the books he was probably referring to the witch's books and the tone of his voice was not normal and like he was possessed so probably the witch's spirit knew that I I took her books and possessed Ryan to try to get them back. After that I was thinking that if the witch wants to, she can possess my father or mother to try to take the book from me or she can possess me so I can return the book to her. Well now I need to be suspicious of any of my friends or family because they may be possessed by that damn witch.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to write this report. I'll keep researching the language of the books. Probably the next report will be in part 3. Wish me luck to break this curse.",

        "text": "I'm a super average middle aged woman. I am a bookworm who works in the local library, watches Jeopardy, and goes to church once in a while. There is nothing really special about me and no reason to look twice at me. Despite all of this, a week ago, I was chosen by something supernatural. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was sitting in a coffee shop drinking my latte and daydreaming when I felt someone standing right behind me. I glanced up, fully expecting to see that the line had backed up so far that someone was standing uncomfortably close to me, and was greeted by the brightest blue eyes I'd ever seen, staring right at me. I wriggled uncomfortably and scooted my chair in closer to the table before asking, “May I help you?”  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe person standing there nodded and then sat down at the table across from me. The person was dressed all in white and had the pale blonde hair which was almost white; the only color I could see was the blue eyes staring out of a pale face. I don't think I took a breath until she spoke. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n “Why, yes. You may help me. You are, I think, the perfect candidate.” She nodded again, appraising me, “Yes. You'll do nicely.”  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I'm sorry,” I blustered, “Do nicely for what?” I actually didn't want to know or to even keep sitting at this table, but something about the ferocity of those eyes held me in my place.  “You will fetch things for my... employer. You will be punished for failure.” She opened her coat and pulled out a folded paper then flattened it on the table between us. “This is the contract. Each day, you will be given an item to collect. You will fetch it, bring it to the bench outside your workplace, and leave it there by sundown.” She pushed the contract toward me, “If you agree to these terms, place your thumb on the contract. If you do not, you will not see tomorrow's sunrise.”  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, obviously I agreed. I definitely wanted to see the sunrise. A lot of sunrises, actually, so I decided that it was worth the risk. I put my thumb in the spot she indicated and her smile stretched too far across her face, making her look more like a shark than a person. It was then that I had a second thought: maybe I had chosen wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was startled when I blinked and she disappeared. One second, she was there and the next, she was gone. My stomach began to churn as I looked around hoping to see her at another table or something, well, reasonable. A person offering a contract and then disappearing wasn't a reasonable thing to happen, and my feeling that I shouldn't have signed grew. I was kind of numb as I paid my bill and then walked home, wondering what I had gotten myself into.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few days were easy: I had to fetch firewood, a sharp knife, lamp oil, a lighter - mundane things which were easy to find. Then the requests began to get more difficult. On the fifth day, I had to find twelve smooth, round stones. They also had to be similar in size, which made it even more difficult. I drove an hour to the lake and spent the better part of the day walking on the shoreline looking for the stones. By the time I was done, I had exactly twelve smooth stones of various, though similar size to my eye. I made the trip back just in time to be at the bench before sunset. I lined the stones up on the bench, counting as I did to make sure I hadn't messed up; but I had. When I laid them out in a row, I realized that the size difference between the smallest and the largest was much greater than I thought.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was no fixing it, so I rearranged the stones in the hopes that whomever collected the items didn't realize how different they really were. Suddenly, I felt the person who had given me the contract behind me and, before I really had even registered who it was or what was happening, her hand was around my throat and her lips were at my ear. “Your contract said to fetch twelve smooth stones of similar size. Did you think we wouldn't notice?” Her voice turned into a menacing hiss, “Did you think your little trick of rearranging the stones would work? You failed to fulfill the assignment correctly. Your punishment begins now.” She snapped her fingers and I felt a searing pain in my arm. When I looked down, an X had been burned into my skin. I burst into tears and ran to the bushes where I vomited, terror rising with the bile as I realized how serious these people were. On the heels of that, I realized that these weren't people I was dealing with at all.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I was to deliver myrrh. I immediately panicked because I just knew that there was not going to be a place to purchase that spice in my little town. In fact, I didn't even know where to even begin looking: the only time I've ever even heard that word was in that one Christmas song. So, I pulled out my phone and searched **where can I buy myrrh.** The only viable result was occult store in the big city several hours' drive away. So, I hopped in my car and made my way to the store. I did a lot of speeding and praying that there were no cops along the way, knowing that I would be cutting it close with the round trip. When I got to the store, I barely maintained my composure as I waited for the goth kid in the shop's shirt to finish helping a giggling teen witch. I was just about to interrupt when she giggled one last time, threw the cashier a kiss, and left. My arm began to throb when he told me that they didn't sell myrrh, the mark of failure on my arm reminding me that I had better not fail again. Just as I was about to cry, the kid held up one finger and rushed to the back of the shop where he picked up a dark bottle and handed it to me, telling me that it was myrrh oil and was the best he could do. So, I bought it hoping it would be good enough.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was not. When I rushed to the bench and placed the bottle of oil on the wood, it immediately exploded, sending glass and oil all over. It was a small enough bottle, that I wasn't in much danger standing so close, but I did feel a piece of that dark glass puncture the flesh of my cheek. As I wiped it away, I heard her voice at my ear again “You failed a second time, woman. And now you are covered in the sacrificial oil. Receive your punishment.” As she spoke, I felt the burning pain of another X appearing on my arm, “A third failure will not be tolerated.” I rushed home to tend my new X and then cried myself to sleep. I didn't know what she might have in store for me in the morning but I knew I had to come through. My life literally depended on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, I woke to find a note on my bedside table: *Bring a human sacrifice.*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been sitting here at my table thinking about this for hours. I wrote all of this out as a kind of confession, thinking I would leave it on the table so when the authorities catch me, as they inevitably would, they would know why I did what I did. Here's what I realized: the person in white was using me to gather the things for a Biblical sacrifice. I finally remembered the story of the God contest and the story of Abraham where God tells him to sacrifice his son but sends a ram at the last minute because Abraham was willing to obey and that was the test.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't do it, though. I can't grab a person and take her or him to the bench to be a sacrifice. I'm not willing to obey.  So, I'm going to go. At sunset this evening, I will be sitting on the bench in front of my library.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe, like in Abraham's story, God will give me an out.",

        "text": "My wife heard me sobbing in my sleep again last night. She later told me I'd been trembling too, and that was what had woken her up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ron, it's been six months! You've got to talk to a therapist now. I'll come with you\", she said. The desperation was clear in her voice.\n\n\n\nI stared at the pattern on the blanket and waited for reality to slowly set in. When it did, it didn't bring much relief. I'd gotten better at putting up a facade of normalcy in the last couple of months, but the darkness had slowly crept into my dreams. You can only pretend when you're awake.\n\n\n\n\"What was it today?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"Same as always, flashbacks of being bullied at school\", I lied.\n\n\n\nShe held my head tightly to her stomach and let out an exasperated sigh that let me know I hadn't sounded convincing. \"I don't get it. Why don't you just tell me what happened in the summer? I'm trying to help you but I hate being blocked out like this! I can respect your space but it's hard for me seeing you suffer like this!\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm fine. I've always had these phases. It'll pass\", I lied again, feeling the cold sweat on my forehead.\n\n\n\n\"What phases?? I've never seen you this way before, it only started after you got back from Skokie! Why don't you just tell me what happened?? Please!\", she failed to avoid raising her voice, and to be honest I didn't blame her. \n\n\n\n\"Don't worry. It'll pass\".\n\n\n\nI got out of bed and walked to the window. The snow was falling gently outside.\n\n\n\n\"I'm gonna go finish up that thing I'm writing\", I told her after a while, still staring into the white darkness.\n\n\n\n\"What? Are you – Ron, it's three in the morning!!!\" \n\n\n\n\"I think it'll help when I'm done with it\". I walked up to her and kissed her cheek. I could see the tears starting to form around her eyes, and it broke my heart to see it.\n\n\n\nI put on a shirt and made my way to the bathroom to wash my face, before heading off to my study.\n\n\n\nHalfway there, I felt an overwhelming sadness come over me as I pictured her sad eyes.\n\n\n\nI walked back, and peeped in through the door to see her sitting on the bed holding her head in her hands. \"I love you\", I said, hoping she wouldn't spot the uncertainty in my voice. \n\n\n\nx-x-x-x\n\n\n\nI wish there was another place to begin from, but the truth is it started with a phonecall I got around midnight last May, right after I had finished making love to my Linda, my wife.\n\n\n\n\"What? Who on earth…\" I groaned as I felt around for my phone on the bedside table, broken out of a stupor that was on the verge of drifting seamlessly into sleep.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\n\n\"...Ronald Cheeseman?\" a scratchy voice on the other side asked after a brief pause.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\" I mumbled groggily.\n\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\n\"Yes? Who is this?\"\n\n\n\nI was sure I heard some sniffling this time, but once again, no response. The sound told me there was no problem with the line though.\n\n\n\n\"Look I don't mean to be rude, but I hope you have a good reason for calling at this hour, whoever you are\".\n\n\n\nLinda was now awake, and widened her eyes at me briefly to ask what was going on. I made a clueless face and shook my head at her.\n\n\n\nI was just about to give the anonymous caller a telling off, when he finally spoke again.\n\n\n\n\"Ronny? This is Al. Al Blank\".\n\n\n\nI sat up hurriedly.\n\n\n\n\"Al? Wow…uhh, what's up? Is everything okay? What's wrong with your voice?\"\n\n\n\nEven as I asked, I could tell he had either been crying, or had a bad cold. Given the long silences and what I had heard about Al the last time I'd heard of him, I could tell it probably wasn't a cold.\n\n\n\n\"Ronny, how is everything? How's Linda?\" he asked hoarsely.\n\n\n\n\"Good, good. What about you? Wow, I thought I'd never hear from you again. You've been completely off radar for so long\". \n\n\n\nMy words felt weirdly formal, especially addressing a guy I had gone to both school and university with. I guess that's what happens when you haven't spoken to someone in nearly 10 years.\n\n\nI couldn't make up my mind on whether to say \"sorry about your divorce\", given how long ago it was. I also wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to remind him about it, knowing the circumstances that led up to it. \n\n\n\n\"Hey, Al? Is everything okay, man? Is there something you wanted to say?\"\n\n\n\nMore silence.\n\n\n\n\"You there, buddy?\"\n\n\n\nI couldn't help but feel conscious about how unnatural the \"buddy\" sounded, but I was genuinely concerned for him. I wanted to at least try to make him feel comfortable with my words, not that I could do anything else.\n\n\n\"Listen man… I think… I mean I am…struggling a little bit. Things aren't great, they haven't been for a while\".\n\n\n\"Okay. You wanna talk about it? I'm here to listen\" \n\n\n\"Yeah. I guess I have no other choice\".\n\n\n\"Well, I'm listening. You can take your time\". I had school the next day, but I couldn't just leave Al this way, no matter how sudden this was.\n\n\n\"Ronny, I've got something to ask you\".\n\n\n\"Sure, go on\".\n\n\n\"Can you come over to my place for a few days? I think I need it. I think I need to talk to someone\".\n\n\n\"Umm… I think so? Are you still in Skokie?\" I said unsurely. I didn't want to say no, but trying to squeeze in a weekend trip to Skokie (from Cleveland) would be tough given the heavy end of term workload at the school I taught at. Besides, it seemed like he wanted someone around for more than a couple of days. \"Is it okay if I did that next month once summer holidays start? Or if you want to come over here I could go over this Friday and drive you back to my place the next day. Linda and I would love to catch up with you!\" \n\n\nI somehow knew asking him to drive himself wouldn't be a good idea, and to be honest, I wasn't sure if he was allowed to, or if he even had a car anymore. I didn't want to risk embarrassing him by asking.\n\n\n\"I don't want Linda to see me … like this. And I don't really think I can leave the house either. It's complicated. I'll tell you when you're here. Next month is fine though. Yeah, still here in Skokie\". Al blew his nose, his voice sounded sad and distant.\n\n\n\"Alright\", I said, immediately knowing what he meant by \"like this\", even though he didn't elaborate. \"You sure you're gonna hold up fine till then? Do you have someone else there with you? Anyone to talk to? Are you seeing a professional of some kind?\"\n\n\n\"Don't worry. It's not a… not a time thing. I just need to get some things off my chest … or so I think. And some company … well that would help. I can wait a month. I live alone now. Becca and I got divorced by the way…I mean … that was a long while ago\". Al seemed to be shifting from talking to me to softly muttering to himself midway through his sentences, and I strained to catch everything he was saying. \n\n\n\"Yes…I'd heard. I tried to reach out to you but you just disappeared off the face of the earth, man! All social media accounts gone, and your number was unreachable too. And then…yeah\". I stopped myself mid-sentence.\n\n\n\"So you know then\".\n\n\nI kept quiet. I wasn't sure if what I knew counted as much or too little, and I was worried about either of those two possibilities. \n\n\n\"I just wa–\"\n\n\n\"Ronny\", Al spoke at the same time as me after a shared pause. I waited for him to go first. \"I'm so sorry I called you like this… in the middle of the night. But please just know that I had to. I'll hang up now. I'll finish up some work and I've… got an early start tomorrow. I guess you need to sleep too. Sorry if I woke you. I hope… I look forward to seeing you next month. Bye\".\n\n\nAl hung up without waiting for me to say bye, or that I hoped he knew he could call me whenever. His voice was getting heavier towards the end and it seemed like he was about to cry again. I noticed I had walked out of the bedroom, naked, while on the call. I also found my heart racing with a mix of anxiety and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on.\n\n\n When I went back in, I could tell from Linda's concerned face that I seemed a bit dazed. I told her everything Al had said, except the part where he said he didn't want her to see him \"like this\". She knew Al too, of course, but not nearly as well as I did. \n\n\nx-x-x-x\n\n\nAl Blank was one of the more curiously interesting people I knew. For the most part, I had personally thought of Al as the good kind of interesting. Around the time I had last heard of him though, calling him \"interesting\" would have been a rather cruel euphemism to describe the utterly bizarre and tragic set of circumstances that had befallen him.\n\n\n'Al' was short for Ally, but it had once been short for Alireza, the name he was born with. Strangely, it was his caucasian mother, not his half-Persian father called George who had strongly insisted on that name. I guess that's the kind of thing you do when you are deeply in love and find the world full of new and wonderful possibilities. \n\n\nYou don't think about the fact that a child called Alireza Blank could end up being an introvert who would hate being forced into having a five-minute conversation about his \"strange\" name, his multi-ethnic family, and what his religion actually was, every time he met someone new. You also don't think about the possibility that if things went south, that five-minute conversation would often have to end with a mention of his parents' divorce.\n\n\nBy the time you're in middle-school, kids pick on the tiniest of things that stand out about you, and a guy with a first name and a last name that didn't seem to go together was an easy target. I didn't exactly have it easy myself with a name like Cheeseman, but Al had it way worse, sometimes bordering on really malicious stuff. Adolescents can be the most vicious people sometimes, especially since, unlike adults, they often don't have to risk losing a job or being socially shunned over it.\n\n\nIt was probably all the unwanted attention (and possibly his parents' divorce) that made Al officially change his name to Ally right after he graduated from high school. It didn't make any difference to the people who knew him though. We still called him Al, same as before.\n\n\nOf course, the curious history of his name isn't even half of what made Al's story fascinating. \n\n\nNow this may sound like an impolite thing to say about someone, but growing up, he was about the most invisible kid you could imagine. He looked positively bored with the mundane realities of everyday life, and wanted no part in it whatsoever.  His short, pudgy frame didn't betray even the slightest bit of athletic ability. Heck, he wasn't even interested in watching or following sport … or anything else that kids his age liked to watch or talk about! \n\n\nHis grades at school were consistently poor. He couldn't sketch, paint, sing, dance, play an instrument, speak in public, and never showed interest in any of these things either. He even hated being outside! \n\n\nOne would possibly put this down to the bullying he faced, but here's the thing: I'd known him since first grade and the bullying only really started around seventh grade when the kids started fully imbibing all the nasty stuff from their parents and surroundings. It was around eight grade when his parents got divorced too. But he was always that way from the beginning! \n\n\nHe even sat next to me for the whole year in fourth grade, and despite my best attempts, I could barely even call him a friend by the end of it. He hated talking, and preferred to stare outside the window to look at the squirrels instead. He wasn't shy or timid. In fact, he had a quiet, foreboding sort of confidence that added something of a mystique about him.\n\n\nWhile he did answer when spoken to, he would look mildly irritated at being forced to put his complex thoughts into words for us mortals. He may well have had some sort of secret superiority complex, but if he did, he was too unbothered to tell us even that. \n\n\nI'd been to his house, and his parents both seemed perfectly nice. His dad was very quiet and mild-mannered, his mom was a bit eccentric but seemed to love children. No one ever heard about any problems with the Blanks, and while the divorce came as a surprise, it was about as \"mutual\" as a divorce can get, with both parents continuing on civil terms. For all intents and purposes, Alireza Blank was a nihilistic grandpa stuck in the body of a plump little kid who perhaps quietly thought he was better than everyone else for reasons best known to him.\n\n\nIn ninth grade, something happened that changed him for good. Maybe it was because he was already getting called names, or maybe it was his parents, but he had become more detached than ever by that time. Then, one day, he made the mistake of crossing our English teacher, Mrs. Shaw. Mrs. Shaw, may god rest her soul, was a tiny woman with white frizzy hair who loved putting the fear of god into kids twice her size, and often their parents as well.\n\n\nThat year, we were asked to submit a final term essay at least 1500 - 2000 words long. That's a lot of words for a ninth grader, and all of us cursed and grumbled our way through it for a whole week, knowing there was a C+ waiting for us at the end if we were lucky. I'm sure Al hated it too, seeing as he submitted an essay that consisted of three short sentences. \n\n\nMrs. Shaw gave him the worst kind of dressing down that you could still get away with as a teacher back then. Nowadays you'd be straight up fired from your job if you said some of the things she said to Al that day, and in front of the whole class too.\n\n\nI won't go into the unsavory details, but she brought up everything from the divorce to the reason why she *really* thought he gets bullied by others. Stuff like that doesn't just come from wanting to discipline a student, but feeling personally insulted by one. It got pretty ugly and most of us were wishing we could leave halfway through it. By the end of it, Al was in tears. I'd never seen him cry before. None of us had.\n\n\nSurprisingly, it did the trick. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, Al started making a concerted effort to talk to people and put himself more out there. He was still very much an introvert, but he no longer looked like he pitied everyone else's existence anymore. He even got pretty good at taking jokes at his own expense, laughing along with others. That sort of thing really goes a long way in dissuading bullies, for the most part. Like I said, Al was never really short on confidence.\n\n\nHe never quite got into any co-curriculars, but he did start putting more effort into his studies. And while most of his grades went up from poor to average, he reserved his best efforts for English class. We had Mrs. Shaw again in tenth grade. All of us received the shock of our lives when, almost exactly a year after that unpleasant incident, Al got an A in his tenth grade English final assignment. No one else had scored above a B+, with most of us scoring lower.\n\n\nMrs. Shaw, a woman who looked like she had never smiled at anyone in her life, made Al stand up and had the whole class applaud him for his incredible turnaround. She then had him read out the whole essay to us. She told us it was the best she'd read at this level in her twenty five years of teaching. All of us cheered as Al went very red in the face. Big Bob Watkins, the guy we jokingly called Mrs. Shaw's son because he sat on a wheelchair right beside her desk, later swore he saw her tear up and that the rest of us couldn't see it from the front because of her extremely thick glasses. We didn't believe him of course, we thought that was taking it too far.\n\n\nAl and I weren't really close in school. That only happened when we ended up in the same English Literature program at university. We hadn't coordinated our applications or anything, and it was a pleasant surprise to see him in my class on the first day. When you're in a new place and nervous, you tend to stick to people you already know. We grew real tight pretty quick.\n\n\nAl was driven by two pursuits during our freshman year. One, he decided he never wanted to go to work and instead would follow his passion to become a full-time writer. When I say he \"decided\" that, I don't mean he casually shared that desire with his peers and professors. He became wholly fixated on it, the same way he hadn't let himself rest until he had wrenched an A out of Mrs. Shaw in tenth grade. In a way it made complete sense. Writing was the only thing he was good at, and perhaps more importantly the one thing that gave him a sense of purpose and identity. \n\n\nHe also developed a strong infatuation towards a tall, freckled girl from the Anthropology department. It just happens that I'd signed up for a beginner-level anthropology course for reasons totally unrelated to the girl, and naturally Al asked me to set him up with her. Now, no one believes me when I tell them, but I swear I didn't know she would fall for me instead, despite my best efforts to put in several good words for Al. In time, I fell in love with her too, and that's how Linda Brooking became Mrs. Linda Cheeseman seven years later.\n\n\nIf Al had any negative feelings when Linda and I started dating, he did a pretty good job of hiding it. Apart from giving us more space as a couple, he still spoke to me the same way and sat next to me in class. He always remained a shy and awkward around Linda, but he was that way around women in general. \n\n\nBut one spurned pursuit drove him to double down harder on the other one. The one he had full control over, from his end at least. Two years after we graduated, I was finishing my post-grad and had moved in with Linda. Al, on the other hand, had shown zero desire to either apply for a job, or to continue studying. Meanwhile, he had signed up to about a dozen writers' clubs, had hired and fired a literary agent, and had approached countless publishers with all sorts of manuscripts. \n\n\n\"You've got to have a back-up plan, you know\", Linda had told him on one of his rare dinner visits to our former Chicago apartment. \"Your dedication is admirable, and I'm sure something will work out, but people just making it big as an author off the bat like that is rare. All great authors were doing something else before they got published. That's just how it works!\"\n\n\nAl had shuffled uncomfortably, mumbled something, and stole a quick sideways glance at me. He had made me promise I wouldn't tell Linda that he was dating a girl called Becca at the time, lest she double down on him needing to get a job. I would've told him the same thing, of course, but I knew better than to argue with him knowing full well I wouldn't win.\n\n\nWhen I said bye to him that night, I knew he didn't appreciate the nagging and wasn't gonna turn up or stay in touch for a while. I was more right than I had thought.\n\n\nI next heard from him more than a year later. It was a phonecall from the man himself.\nThe bastard had only gone and gotten himself published! He asked me if I'd like to pre-order a copy and of course I said yes! \n\nBut that wasn't nearly the end of it! When it hit the shelves, the book started selling like hot cake. It sold around 7000 copies in its opening week, and continued to be on the nationwide bestseller list for the first month and a half! For a debut novelist to pull that off was the stuff of dreams. The kind of dream that only Al could've dared to dream without a backup plan. \n\n\nFunnily enough, and I hate saying this about a friend's work, I didn't quite see the appeal after reading it. It was your average murder mystery with a somewhat interesting twist at the end that I frankly saw coming before I got halfway through. But heck, what the hell did I, an English teacher at your run-of-the-mill school know how these things work! And even if it was a fluke, even if these things are just a matter of luck and good publicity, I wasn't gonna begrudge Al his moment in the sun after he had busted his gut for it for so long!\n\n\nNow, when you sell those kinds of numbers as an author, it goes without saying that you're going to earn yourself a book deal. Al announced it to the guests after getting quite drunk at his wedding, which happened three months after he got published. I got pretty drunk myself and Linda had to drive us home the next morning. I didn't know it then, but that was the last time I would see Al.\n\n\nWe would occasionally talk over the phone until around two to three years afterwards, when things took a weird turn. Al's second book came out. It was the second installment in the initial deal he had signed. \n\nI didn't find it any better or worse than the first one, but it didn't come anywhere close in terms of success. In fact, considering it was from a bestselling author, it wouldn't be harsh to say that it did pretty badly. But that wasn't the weird part.\n\n\nAbout a week after the book came out, Al had a psychotic episode. He got violent at home with Becca, and accused her of colluding with his own mother in conspiring against him or trying to kill him. He then proceeded to try to take his own life, failed, and subsequently went through a prolonged treatment for schizophrenia. \n\n\nIt was around this point that he cut off all contact with me, and indeed with nearly everyone else he knew. Becca would pick up when I would call, telling me he wasn't available, or it wasn't a good time. I would keep checking in periodically, until one day when he picked up himself and told me he didn't want me to call again. \n\n\nThe last time I heard about Al was from a mutual friend, at a high school reunion many years ago. Al had cut him off too, but his wife knew someone in Becca's immediate family. They'd told him that Becca had gotten herself a divorce after Al displayed further bouts of unexplained rage. \n\nHe told me something else about Al which to this day makes me feel uneasy to think about, even when I try to see it through the prism of mental illness. Apparently, a few months before the divorce happened, Al had submitted another manuscript. Not to his regular publishers, who by that time had canceled the book deal for obvious reasons. In fact, it wasn't a novel at all, but a short story, if you could call it one.\n\nWhat it really was was a rambly, badly-written essay about his dog. It had no characters nor a plot. Just meaningless, disconnected details about what the dog liked to do all day. \n\n\nx-x-x-x\n\n\nWhen I pulled up to Al's driveway that summer, my stomach sank a bit. It was completely overrun by weeds that were spilling over from the filthy front lawn. The house looked like it had seen much better days, with the paint peeling off in many places. Linda and I had discussed the possibility that Al might be in need of money, and if I should make the offer myself without waiting for him to ask. That seemed increasingly likely now.\n\n\nAl was waiting for me near the rusted garage door with a toolbox near his feet. I could tell he had been trying to unjam it for a while. When I got out, he stared blankly at me for a good few seconds before breaking into what felt like a forced smile and offered his hand, which I shook. He had lost most of his hair, which made him look older than he was supposed to at his age. His eyes looked like he didn't get much sleep. \n\n\nWe exchanged pleasantries before Al led me inside. The first thing that hit me was a mild musty smell that comes with a lack of ventilation. The second thing I noticed, once my eyes adjusted to the poor light, was the massive amounts of junk that cramped the living space. Discarded boxes, heaps of paper tied together with rope, and the whole gamut that comes with being a hoarder.\n\n\nI didn't know where to start as I sat down on the sofa with a bunch of old files stacked to one side. Al wasn't saying much, and in fact looked mildly irritated by my presence.\n\n\n\"Damn shame\", he finally said, kicking at the floor.\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing you'd want to know about now, at any rate. Unless you're okay with breaking into someone's house. Are you?\"\n\n\nI widened my eyes in alarm.\n\n\n\"I'm joking\", he said, shaking his head.\n\n\nI wasn't so sure he was.\n\n\n\"Al, what's going on with you? I'm sorry but all this…you wanna talk to me? I'm here to talk, or listen to you\"\n\n\n\"That's why I asked you to come here. But it's not the right time now. They won't be here till next week, so we just have to stick it out for the weekend. Sorry about the house being a mess, you can take the extra bedroom upstairs. That one's pretty uncluttered. If you've got something to say about all the stuff I have in here, don't\".\n\n\n\"Okay. Who is \"they\"…?\"\n\n\n\"You'll know\", he quipped dismissively.\n\n\nI looked at Al and felt uncomfortable by a returning sense of familiarity that was growing in me. This wasn't the Al I knew after tenth grade. This was the one I had known in elementary school and through most of middle school. Completely shut off from the world, forced civility betraying the unmistakable hint of irritation in the company of others. That silent arrogance was back, as if there was a whole world inside his mind he didn't want to share with anyone. I guess the rough times he had endured had weathered away at his carefully built social pretenses, but then why had he called me here?\n\n\nIt goes without saying that I was also seriously questioning his mental balance at this point. \n\n\n\"You get out of there if he starts making you uncomfortable, you hear me?\" Linda said over the phone on my second night there.\n\n\nI was in the extra bedroom upstairs, which, while mostly empty, didn't seem like it had been opened in a long time. Thick layers of dust lined the floor and the odd piece of furniture. On the wall was a framed picture of Becca, Al's former wife, with her arm around a large doberman, and another one of Al and Becca smiling at the camera, with the same doberman beside them. \n\n\n\"I will. But I don't know how to ask if he needs money. He's acting like he doesn't even want to talk to me. He literally shushed me when I tried to make conversation at breakfast\", I told Linda.\n\n\n\"Yeah I'm not sure either. I think just let it be, or maybe try to slip it into conversation if you get the chance\", she said.\n\n\nI did exactly that over the weekend, casually broaching on the subject while we were picking out some stuff from the nearby departmental store. It was the first time we had left the house that weekend, and I assumed it was meant to break the ice, but he barely spoke. When I asked, Al gave me a look of disappointment that immediately made me regret it.\n\n\n\"I know you're confused. You'll see soon enough\".\n\n\nAfter several more attempts at trying to get him to talk to me, I made up my mind to leave at the earliest chance. I did not feel qualified enough to help him, and he was strongly resisting all attempts at conversation. I didn't want to drag a grown adult to a doctor against his wishes. Besides, these things never work if the person isn't willing to talk.\n\n\nAnd to be perfectly honest, I was starting to get a bit spooked by this point, and there was absolutely nothing to do in this place when your host wasn't even up for conversation. I fell asleep that night while trying to think of excuses to leave early the next day, and if I could find other ways of finding him the help he clearly needed.\n\n\nI don't know how long I'd slept, but I was jolted awake by Al shaking the daylights out of me. \n\nI let out a cry in horror as I took in what was happening. \n\n\"Ron, WAKE UP! THEY'RE HERE! They're fucking here!\" he hissed loudly, almost menacingly.\n\n\"Al, what the — what is wrong with you?\" I said, trying to shake him off. I looked at my phone, which said it was just past midnight.\n\n\"COME ON, there's no fucking time. You want to see this, I've been waiting to show you for so long!\"\n\n\n\"Show what? Al — \" I protested as he held my collar and nearly dragged me out of the room, as much as someone half-a-foot shorter than you can manage. \n\n\nI was wide awake now, and could see Al's eyes crazed with excitement, the veins on his neck protruding as he muscled me into his room. \n\n\nWhat on earth was he going to show me?\n\n\nIf the circumstances were any different, I'd go on for a bit about just how bad the smell in Al's room was. But presently he forced me down on his bed, right beside the closed window that overlooked the street outside his house. \n\n\n\"You see that?\" he hissed softly, pointing to a car that was pulling into the garage across the street.\n\n\n\"What the fuck is going on?\" I asked, bewildered.\n\n\n\"You're gonna need this\", he said, handing me a pair of binoculars. \"And don't make a noise or they'll hear you. That's why I've kept the lights off\".\n\n\n\"Al… seriously. You've got to stop. You've got to stop this man\", I said, pushing his hand away. \n\n\n\"Just take a look. If you think I've wasted your time you can get me admitted in any psych ward of your choice\", he said, still pointing to the car across the street.\n\n\nI started saying what I wanted to say, before deciding not to. I indulged Al, more out of fear for my safety if I didn't comply than anything else.\n\n\nI looked through the binoculars as two figures exited the garage across the street. One was a short woman whose greyish white hair seemed to glisten under the street light as she locked the door behind her. She proceeded to push a rather large young man on a wheelchair towards the front door of their house. They were talking, though I couldn't hear what they were saying through the closed glass window in Al's room.\n\n\nNot that I particularly cared to eavesdrop, because my jaw was already on the floor by this point. A cold shiver ran down my spine as my brain tried to make sense of the impossibility that my eyes were witnessing. It was Mrs. Shaw and Big Bob Watkins, looking for all intents and purposes exactly as they did from the time I knew them at school, over 18 years ago. \n\nLeaving aside the fact that it made no sense to see them living together, there was no way Bob could still have looked like that well into his late-30s. Even more pertinently, Al and I had been to Mrs. Shaw's funeral during our final year at university.\n\n\nI turned to Al in shock, who had pre-emptively put a finger on his lips. He looked back at me in the darkness with a crazed look in his eyes.\n\n\n\"Al\", I whispered, my hands trembling as their grip on the binoculars loosened. \"What the fuck is going on?!\"\n\n\nAl slowly pulled his finger away from his lips, that maniacal look still on his face\n\n\n\"You would've thought I'm crazy if I told you instead of showing you\", he whispered back. \"But this isn't even half of it. This isn't even the craziest part\".",

        "text": "I can’t say I’ve ever been one for looking in the mirror, sure when I get ready in the morning I take a glance, but that’s about as far as it goes.\n\nBut tonight. Tonight I stepped out of the shower and there it was, something strange, something different.\n\nThe room was thick with steam, I could hardly make out the shapes of the sink and the cabinet. But there, in the misted glass of the mirror... I stepped closer, and wiped away some of the condensation with my hand, peering through the fog, looking at the reflection. It was off. Something about it felt off, like there was some fuckin' thing in the room with me. \n\nI stood there for a little while, staring into the mirror, and the more I looked at my reflection the more I knew, something was very wrong with it. I blinked and shook my head, but I couldn't shake the feeling. Sure, he moved as I moved, his face contorting in the same ugly way as mine. And yeah, he frowned along with me, his eyes darting around exactly the same. But it wasn’t me. *It was not me.*\n\nI took a step closer and tried to get a better look, and he stepped closer with me.\n\n\"Who are you?\" We whispered, together, voices barely audible.\n\n\"I don't know,\" we replied, uncertain, low and hollow.\n\n\"What do you want?”, a good question I thought, but we had nothing more to say.\n\nHe just stared back at me with a blank expression. Instinctually, I knew I should leave, but I was mesmerised by his presence. I wanted to talk more too, but I found that no sound would come out anymore. And then finally, he spoke for me.\n\n\"Hello Charles,\" he said, his voice uncanny, a perfect imitation of mine.\n\nI was unable to reply, almost like he’d taken my voice, so I just kept watching.\n\n\"Do you know who I am?\" he asked me, all polite.\n\nI shook my head. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t afraid of the damn thing.\n\nThen he flashed a smile that made my skin crawl. \"I'm you,\" he said, \"and I've decided that it's time for you to go.\"\n\n“Time for me to go? What the fuck?” I thought. “Go where?”\n\nI tried to brush it off, to calm myself down, but my heart was undeniably pounding away in my chest, and he seemed to be getting closer to me. I tried to turn away, but even my body wasn’t listening to me anymore. And he laughed at me, laughed at my predicament, it was a gravelly, sinister racket.\n\n“Like I said, I’ve decided. So it’s time you went.”\n\nAnd with that, *he stepped out of the fuckin’ mirror.*\n\nInto the real world.\n\nRight in front of me.\n\nHe took me by the arm and pulled me along the wet, tiled floor into my hallway. I wanted to fight, but I was completely unable to move, and he was strong anyway, much stronger than me.\n\nHe dragged me along the hallway, my heels burning from the friction, and next thing I know he’s taking me through the apartment door, onto the concrete walkway outside. My feet were bloody now, and in my mind I was yelling, but to the rest of the world I would have been dead silent, save for the sound of my ankles dragging along the coarse pavement.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was in the middle of a fuckin' highway, in nothing but my bathroom robe, arm still in his grasp. Ribbons of light were passing us by, but not one of the damn cars stopped to check what was going on.\n\nHe turned to me then, his face illuminated by the street-lamps, shadows softly strobing from the passing beams\n\nHe looked me dead in the eyes, one last time, and said, all matter of fact like, ”It’s time for you to go, Charles.” And then he just released his grip, and stepped back, and faded into the night.\n\nI damn near fell into the highway. Stumbling, I somehow caught myself, my legs were weak and uncoordinated. But, I had my control again.\n\nAnd the man? Well, he had vanished.\n\nAlone, I stood in my fear.\n\n*What the fuck had just happened? What did he fuckin' mean? And, what the in the ever-loving fuck was he?*\n\nI tried to collect myself, clearing my mind of the cloud of confusion and all the questions.\n\nI had to get back to my apartment, certainly I couldn't stay here in the middle of the damn highway. So I made my way across the traffic and began then journey back home, bathrobe fluttering behind me in the cold night air.\n\nEvery now and then I would hear a sound, or catch a glimpse of something out the corner of my eye that would make me turn, and every time I turned I figured I would see the guy, standing there, or something. Maybe he would be watching, staring at me all expressionless, or maybe he’d be grinning and laughing with that fuckin' awful laugh of his. But he was nowhere.\n\nThe bastard was gone. \n\nShivering, barefoot and bleeding, somehow I made it back to my apartment. At first I was too shit-scared to go inside, *what if he was still there?* But I didn’t have any other options. The door was still ajar and I nudged it all the way open only to find it empty, so I went inside and slammed the door shut behind me.\n\nI wrapped myself in the first blanket I could find, and while I was warming myself on the couch, I tried to rationalise what’d just happened.\n\nI couldn’t though. That man in the mirror had not been a figment of my imagination, I knew that for sure.\n\nHe was *very* real. He had been there with me, and the thought was terrifying.\n\nAnd then, I remembered, what he had said.\n\n\"It's time for you to go.\"\n\nI rushed back to the bathroom, it was still thick with steam in there, so I had to wipe away the condensation from the glass, then I peered through the fog into the mirror.\n\nBut it was only my reflection, my eyes and my face.",

        "text": "  \n\nThe hits, the cold ground, the blows, the pain. Curling to protect myself from the truncheons, I felt like traveling back in time when I used to protect my teenage self from my father's fists.\n\n\"Don't worry Colton, we'll take you to your favorite spot.\" One of the prison wardens said to me while they kept on bludgeoning me, their favorite and sadistic fitness exercise.\n\n\"What's up Colt? You wanted to fight earlier, why don't you show us what you got?\" Another asked. \n\nI did not resist once. Not that I enjoyed the beating, or I liked the so-called spot, but I just needed some kind of rest or escape, wordplay not intended. After they decided I got enough, the wardens picked up what was left of me and dragged me to solitary confinement.\n\nA pile of reinforced concrete bricks devoid of windows or any source of light, with a small metallic door equipped with a vision panel. That was the spot, one of the isolation cells. They threw me inside and locked the door without wishing me a good stay as they used to. \n\n\"2nd of March 97\" I whispered while getting up, trying not to lose track of the dates since I did not know how long they intended to keep me inside that hell. \n\nSurrounded by pure darkness, I waved my arms around slowly until I located the tiny bed in front of me, before I sat and sighed. The old and dirty bed squeaked, and I closed my eyes trying to think of anything positive when I suddenly felt a weight pressing the part of the mattress next to me as the bed squeaked for the second time.\n\n\"Who's that?\" I asked, and obtained silence for an answer. \n\nMy eyes reflexively widened, more due to fear than the need to see who or what was there. I flailed my arms in the direction of the squeaking sound, trying to seize the culprit but to no avail. Instead, my gesture prompted the intruder to speak:\n\n\"I wish you die here.\" I clearly heard from a husky female voice.\n\n\"Hey! HEY! GET ME OUT OF HERE! HEY!\" I shouted as I stood up, walking backwards until my back touched the metallic door. I turned around and added:\n\n\"GET ME OUT OF HERE! I WANNA GET OUT! PLEASE!\" I pleaded as my heart sunk in despair.\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" A warden said as he arrived, hitting the door with his truncheon. \n\n\"Please man! Hey! Please, let me out there's some fucking freak inside here!\" I tried to explain. \n\n\"I said SHUT THE FUCK UP! Is that the only shit you could come up with? What you up to? Or should I say what are you on?\" The warden asked. \n\n\"I swear, I heard something you gotta let me out. NOW! PLEASE!\" I insisted. \n\n\"We all know you alone in that cell Colt. Just shut up and enjoy your stay inmate. If I hear you again, you gonna be very sorry.\" He warned and left, turning deaf ears to my pleas. \n\n\"What did you expect? Inmate?\" She asked, and I turned around unable to see anything. \n\n\"Who are you?\" I questioned. \n\n\"You asking for what you can't comprehend.\" She replied. \n\n\"What the fuck you want?\" I asked, terrified at that point, with my voice getting brittle. \n\n\"Trust me on that Colton. I want to kill you so bad, so bad. But The Silencer would not let me. He says he has plans for you.\" She spoke. \n\n\"What? What the— why are you here? How did you get in here? Is that some dumb prank? Huh? You just called me inmate. You with the wardens, right?\"\n\n\"Once again, you asking for answers you can't comprehend. My mission here, is to make sure you never come back to such a place. The interesting part for me is that—it will hurt, for you.\" \n\nI had enough of all the dread and the mystery. My fighting spirit returned and I started throwing punches in front of me. If I could just touch her, catch her, I would be able to neutralize her and the sick joke would be over. I even hurt myself by landing blows on the solid walls and the little shelf. \n\n\"You can't touch me, but I can touch you.\" She spoke. \n\n\"WHAT IS THIS? WHAT ARE YOU?\" I shouted in despair and frustration. \n\n\"My turn.\" She said.\n\nI felt something pull my left arm, something immaterial, as if some kind of black hole or portal tried to absorb it. I resisted, trying to pull away in vain. After a few seconds, I felt a pressure around my hand and forearm, and in no time, that thing started to crush my limb as I screamed in pain. I felt the bones shattering and tearing through the skin, and heard the warden coming back and yelling at me. Fortunately, the excruciating pain knocked me out. \n\nTwo days after, I woke up in the medical facility. I tried to sit, but I quickly realized that my left forearm and hand were missing. The nurses told me that the damage was done beyond repair and no other choice was left. They had to act quickly and decided for me to prevent the worst, as something unknown had severely infected the amputated part. \n\nI never saw or heard that woman again. I never went back to prison again. I do not know what that Silencer wanted from me, but I am happy about my new life and indeed never committed any crime again.",

        "text": "\"YOU FUCK!\" she let out a guttural yell and arched her pointer finger at her grandmother, who was covering her mouth and nose with her flat hands and watching her with bulgy eyes.\n\nShe thrashed around on the splintered wooden planks - the house was derelict, it was her grandmother's house - squirming around and clutching her throat with crooked, veiny fingers. The grandfather clock chimed, marking midnight. The little Christmas men behind the glass danced around and were then consumed by the little trapdoors they had come out of.\n\n\"Please, make her stop!\" the grandmother wailed, holding onto my leather uniform. With the abundance of old photos and withered lilies, it was poignantly clear that her late husband had recently passed.\n\nI immediately scribbled down 'DIP-A' on the notepad I had with me, for 'Deceased Individual Possession (Ancestral)'. This kind of thing happened quite often, maybe thrice a month.\n\n\"DIRTY BITCH! GET OUT!\" she barked at me this time. The dangling glass shards from the mini-chandelier above rattled a bit.\n\n\"Alright, time to go.\" I said dismissively, unbothered. This was protocol, usually this would weaken the ancestor's hold and make it more prone to leave the host as it was not getting the attention it needed, sort of like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Spirits are a lot less stubborn than fiction depicts them to be.\n\nShe rose to her knees, looking at me through her eyebrows, and her autumn hair wafted upwards like a threatened cobra. She was wild, feral. *Irrepressible*, as we called it. This was not an ancestor of hers. I broke the cardinal rule of working for PISA, *never let your guard down.* But I felt perfectly fine for two reasons; one being that this was my last shift before being promoted to the call centre - a much less intimidating job with a much higher paycheck - and that there was no way that this being could hurt me. It hadn't displayed any signs of being capable of harm, usually *those ones* could tamper with electricity or something - we got them about once every three months. But it could definitely have harmed the host. Likely disfigure.\n\nI scribbled down 'IBP-T' on my notepad. This time for 'Intelligent Being Possession (Targeted)'.\n\n\"Is it okay if you step outside for a second?\" I asked the grandmother coolly, to which she heeded with relief. I think she felt obligated to be there or something. Nonetheless, she shouldn't have to see this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody involved in the predicament, primarily the grandmother, knew that I was a part of the Paranormal Investigation and Specialist Agency (PISA), nor did she know it existed. She thought I was a paramedic. PISA existed secretly, very closely watched by the big guys, like the FBI or the CIA or whatnot. But they were an independent agency. PISA was in charge of controlling unstable entities and keeping them secret from the general population. The 'scouts' monitored the reports from the police force. When the details of the situation became 'anomalies', which were really just situations that had the criteria to be deemed paranormal, they brought it to *our* \\- the troopers and call centre agents - attention and we'd override the interaction. For example, the grandmother in that situation actually dialled the ambulance, but I came instead.\n\nWhen situations got *really* bad, like if an anomaly was caused by higher beings like demons or cult work, it would be forwarded to the agency higher in the ranks. We called them 'The Guns'. We never learned of their acronym or anything, only that we had to press a big red button in case of emergencies and the information would be processed to them. It was 1995 at the time so we mainly operated by these specially-made box computers and by telephone.\n\nThe cases we got seldom ended up being transferred to The Guns because the important ones would be sent straight to them anyways.\n\nExcept for this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the subsequent July morning, I strolled into the agency, past the stiff guards with the swirly cords behind their ears, and into reception. I ticked off my name and dropped my duffel bag on the vacant desk in the call centre. There was a computer on the desk, a potplant, a black telephone, a fax machine, and a grid with many little buttons.\n\n\"Welcome, Chester!\" my boss Richard boomed, spinning around on his wheeled chair to face me.\n\n\"Hey, big guy.\" I moaned tediously.\n\nI scanned the room, and the call centre was not as populous as I had anticipated. There were maybe 20 people at the time, but when I was terminated later that year, there were 8 left.\n\n\"First day on the job, aren't you excited? You can relax because we don't get many calls so-\"\n\n\"I know. I've been a trooper for, what, two years now?\"\n\n\"Right,\" he said with a sudden drop of enthusiasm. \"Well if you know what to do already, you should get to it.\"\n\nHe tramped back to his desk on the other side of the gargantuan room and the ambient chatter of the surrounding calls really kicked in. There were only around three calls active at the time, and each of them were *very* similar.\n\n\"Caller said accomplice is squirming around on the floor, send a trooper to check for DIP or MSP.\" said a female voice, probably fulfilling an order. MSP stands for 'Meaningless Spirit Possession'.\n\n\"Sir, all will be okay. If you can, please get her off of the floor and to a seated position.\" said a robotic male voice.\n\nWe didn't usually get the majority of calls about possessions or unusual human behaviour, a lot of the time it's 'Accidents Caused by Unidentified Beings' or 'Spontaneous Acts of Terrorism'.\n\nIn my prolonged period of idly browsing past records, I sent a fax to the Investigations Department about my findings as a trooper on my previous shift. This was compulsory as I identified a targeted possession, meaning that somebody orchestrated it. Usually, this ended up being someone who was seeking revenge for something.\n\nI went back to my desk and waited. The flow of calls dwindled and eventually there were no calls for a minute at a time. But I got a message back from the Investigations Department.\n\n\"*Regarding Call Centre Agent 105 (Chester Nurcombe)'s findings,*\n\n*Hello Mr Nurcombe. We regret to inform you that we were unable to find whoever orchestrated the IBP-T that you made us aware of, but do not fret. We will find out who is responsible. In the meantime, please fill out the appropriate forms as included.*\n\n*Thanks,*\n\n*The Investigations Department\"*\n\nGreat. That's helpful.\n\nThe fax machine spewed the relevant paperwork and incident reports out onto my desk, and just as I touched my ballpoint pen to the first sheet, I got another message.\n\nA blank piece of paper with a short message in the font that the typewriters use. Courier.\n\n\"*WRITHE LIKE THE WORM THAT YOU ARE\"*\n\nI bewilderedly sent the message back to the Investigations Department with a little question mark on it.\n\nThey responded immediately, equally confused. They didn't send that message.\n\nI asked around the call centre and nobody else received the same message. I eventually concluded that it must have been some sort of practical joke, likely from a newbie who didn't know better. In a matter of minutes it was shunted to the back of my mind, a faraway place in my memory. \n\nI got my first call of the day an hour later.\n\n\"Hello? Why did you go quiet, this is an emergency!\" the caller exclaimed.\n\n\"It's okay, you're in good hands,\" I responded, \"your call was just forwarded to me. You're getting the help you need soon.\"\n\nMy computer lit up in bright text from the interface. That's where we got the caller details from. Fax was too slow for situations such as these, but we used it most of the time as it was easier to remain anonymous with it.\n\n\"*Call received from Manhattan police at 3:25 PM EST, caller reporting an erratic individual with symptoms consistent with a DIP or MSP.\"*\n\n\"Okay, ma'am, could you describe how this individual is acting right now?\" I asked assertedly.\n\n\"She's on the floor, wriggling really weirdly. I think she's having a seizure of some sort!\" the caller sobbed.\n\n\"Help is on its way. How was she acting beforehand?\" I jammed my thumb into the little green button to dispatch a trooper. \n\n\"She was just swearing at everyone, screaming and pointing at people.\" \n\nA lot like the case I had yesterday. I typed '*likely IBP-T*' into the database. \n\n\"Okay, thanks for telling me that. Just stay calm for the time being, and stay with the affected individual.\" \n\nFor the next five minutes, I consoled the distressed caller until the trooper arrived.\n\n\"Okay, the paramedic's here. Should I hang up now?\" the caller said.\n\n\"If you think it's appropriate, you may.\" \n\nThe dial tone blared through the speaker. I rest the phone on the cradle and continued on with whatever I was doing. I noticed a sudden surge in calls, at that moment about two-thirds of the agents were engaged. \n\nAnother call, about ten minutes later.\n\nThe database read, \"*Call received from Herkimer County at 3:37 PM EST, caller reporting a mentally unstable individual suddenly unable to stand up.\"*\n\nThis is bad. Something is *very* wrong. \n\n\"Hello, is anyone there?\" the caller yelped into the phone.\n\n\"Yes, I'm here, sir. Your call got forwarded to me. Help is on the way.\" I said and fingered the little green button. \n\n\"Please be quick, he's acting really weird. He's like, writhing around on the floor. I think it's something to do with his brain, do you think it's brain damage?\" the caller asked me, panicked. \n\nWrithing. Writhing around on the floor. \n\n\"Hey, is anyone else getting these calls about the people screaming profanities and having a seizure-like reaction? I think it's a mass possession!\" One of the call centre agents called out into the great room we were all operating in.\n\nThe fax machine.\n\n\"*Regarding Call Centre Agent 105 (Chester Nurcombe)'s findings,*\n\n*Hello, Mr Nurcombe. This is an unusual case indeed. We have detected the presence of a malevolent being; extremely powerful. It appears to be charging, or growing in power rapidly. If anything out of the ordinary occurs, please do not be afraid to call for an emergency.*\n\n*Thanks,*\n\n*The Investigations Department\"*\n\nI re-read the entire message as the caller shouted in my ear, upset when I took more than three seconds to respond to him. \n\nAnother message. It was the typewriter font again.\n\n\"*WRITHE LIKE THE WORM THAT YOU ARE*\n\n*WRITHE LIKE THE WORM THAT YOU ARE*\n\n*WRITHE LIKE THE WORM THAT YOU ARE*\n\n*WRITHE LIKE THE WORM THAT YOU ARE\"* \n\nI looked at my computer in horror as the database told me that I had twelve callers on various other lines, all queued up for me. I looked around the room at the other agents, and they all had the same alert, glassy look. *This is my first day,* I thought to myself, repeating the words like a mantra. \n\nI looked back at the monitor.\n\n*24 queued calls.*\n\nI blinked.\n\n*72 queued calls.*\n\nOh shit. \n\nThe monitor went dark, and I could tell everyone else's did as well when the light that illuminated their faces disappeared. \n\nLucid green words on the screen read - as if my computer turned monochrome - \"*WRITHE LIKE THE WORM THAT YOU ARE\"* \n\nI don't know who ended up making the emergency call, but we all pressed it at the same time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing about anomalies that are transferred to The Guns, is that because PISA was involved, we got legal documents summarising the entire situation. A rare glimpse into the life of the people who work for The Guns. \n\nI'll spare you the details, but I'll just say that there were *a lot* of people who called that day. The Guns ended up tracking the malevolent being in question and found that a man from the country was responsible; ended up stumbling across the being during an occult practice and was used as a vessel for the being to take control of many people across the state of New York. It was all okay in the end, but it was *horrifying* at the time*.* \n\nThey ended up covering it up as a big medical incident, something in the water triggered an epileptic response for various people and it ended up turning into that clusterfuck. \n\nI'm telling this story now as my thirty-year contract of confidentiality ended on the 15th of January, 2023. I am now allowed to tell the stories of my past job, but they *will* come after me. They *will* silence me, or make me out to be some sort of crazy person or something. But what I'm telling you is the complete truth. \n\nIn the short amount of time left, I am happy to answer your questions and detail more stories from my role in the Paranormal Investigations and Specialists Agency. But for now, let that soak in, and really know that there's a lot that you *don't* know.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/covenofhorror/)",

        "text": "Ever lost your mom or dad at the grocery store when you were a kid? That's exactly how I felt when the prematurely closing elevator doors separated me from Jacek. I was grateful that Licorice was still there at least, but that didn't do much to distract me from the fact that I was plummeting down to the deepest level of hell without my trusty tour guide. The huge spider made of human body parts beside me honestly just made it all ten times worse.\n\nI tried to keep it together, I really did. But when the cabin came to a halt and the doors opened, revealing a group of easily a dozen people waiting to push into the elevator, I could barely contain my frustration. Claustrophobia gnawing at me, I hastily shoved my way past the small crowd, closely followed by Licorice. I had to actually *fight* to get out—with everyone rushing into the opposite direction of me, the simple act of exiting the cabin turned into a physical struggle. At last, I staggered out onto the street, heart pounding. \n\n*Okay. Stay where you are. Jacek's gonna find you.*\n\nI tried to calm my nerves. Licorice soothingly licked the side of my face, and I gratefully dragged a weary hand over his scraggly fur. Everything would be alright. I'd just have to stay where I was and wait for Jacek to make his way over to me. Planting my feet firmly on the ground beside the elevator, I nervously stared at the shaft. I tried not to pay too much attention to my surroundings. The painful reality of my current situation had begun to sink in: These weren't my woods. I wasn't walking among the tall, frost-painted trees, there was no snow to pleasantly crunch beneath my shoes, no winter sun smiling down at me. This was the very lowest sphere of hell, a densely populated city where everything was blazing flames and billowing smoke that swallowed the light.\n\nAnd worst of all, I had no idea what to expect of this place and its inhabitants. The Leshy was scary, yes; I never knew what to make of him, either, but this was different. At home, the creatures were familiar. They terrified me, sure; they were all deadly in their own way, but I *knew* them. I had grown up with stories of them, with cautionary tales as well as humorous anecdotes. I was aware of how dangerous they were when at their worst, but also of how benign when at their best. Thus, I had seen the best and the worst of the Leshy, but neither of anybody in this godforsaken hole. \n\nI felt alienated, completely helpless in the face of this foreign environment. Everything here was utterly unnatural. Nobody here was assuming a different form to hide their monstrous appearance, nobody's voice was made to sound like a birdsong or the wind.\n\nThis wasn't my world. \n\nI spun around upon hearing the *ding!* of the elevator, and when Jacek stepped outside, I abandoned all thoughts of boundaries and dignity and threw myself into his arms. I didn't do it out of some romantic notion or to play the damsel in distress—I acted purely on impulse. I didn't get why at first, either. But when Jacek wordlessly leaned in to hold me, I realized that *this*, this was familiar, comfortable even. I soaked up the feeling of safety he exuded like a sponge. Eventually, we awkwardly untangled ourselves, each having to look away for a moment and take some deep breaths. \n\n\"You're shaking,\" he observed after a few seconds.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" was all I could manage to say.\n\nHe snorted. \"That is so… I never thought you could look this uneasy somewhere. *Anywhere*. Honestly, when I took you down here, I thought it wouldn't be a problem for you.\" To my surprise, he didn't sound reproachful or condescending. Just genuinely surprised and a tad apologetic. \"You're okay, right?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said quickly. \n\n\"Lord, I'm sorry, gorgeous. Well, I'm here now. I'll stay close.\"\n\nIt was all I could do not to ask him to hold my hand while walking.\n\nThe streets in Pride were even more crowded than what I'd seen in Wrath. People kept shoving past us, getting uncomfortably close and brushing our shoulders with no regard for personal space. The fear of being trampled to death seemed concrete and imminent. Licorice helped cut our way through the bustle, but I still flinched every time I could feel a stranger's breath on my face or another arm touching mine. \n\n\"Don't worry,\" Jacek said to me from the side. \"They only care about themselves.\"\n\n\"What do you do down here anyways? Are these all sinners?\"\n\n\"They were at one point. See, the boss has two main objectives for the lot of us. First, we obviously work on and encourage society's downfall, as slowly and excruciatingly as possible—that's what I do on the surface. I only come here to attend meetings and go grocery shopping and stuff. Much cheaper than up top.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? What are you working on exactly?\" I inquired.\n\nHe lit up. \"It'd take a while to explain, I'm on several different projects, but I'd love to show you sometime!\" He cleared his throat. \"Once we're out of here. If you wanna see.\"\n\n\"I'd love to,\" I replied in earnest. \"So what's going on down here?\"\n\n\"Okay, so, the folks around us actually work and live here. They were sinners at one point, but they never overdid it. The boss doesn't employ serial killers or tyrants or what have you. Those he actually detests, because they're doing to humanity what *he* wants to do. Encroaching on his territory, you know. Therefore, the real scum goes in the prisons. Each of the spheres has one, and these good people here spend eternity tormenting the inmates, which is something of a punishment in itself. Oh, and of course some people also run the stores and clubs and stuff like that. But the boss presides over all.\"\n\n\"Oh. Huh. I guess I always thought hell would be more medieval-like, not a huge modern metropolis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"How so? Corporate greed, working in a dead-end job until the end of time, an unfeeling boss who ruthlessly plays favorites and never gives you a word of appreciation unless you incessantly kiss his ass…\"\n\n\"So you're saying you're an ass-kisser?\"\n\n\"The worst. But it's easy for me. I'm not like the rest. I willingly gave myself over to him. I didn't wait until I died. He just loves that and, seeing as it doesn't happen everyday, I get the special treatment and the nicest jobs. I often run his personal errants, too. Like an old-time gentleman's servant.\" He chuckled. \"It's great fun, really.\"\n\n\"It was good you left the mill, then. You seem to truly enjoy this,\" I muttered pensively, feeling an unwelcome, inexplicable sting in my chest.\n\n\"Totally. Alright, we made it. Look.\" He pointed up a building that would have put the Trump Tower to shame. It stood out among the others due to mere lavishness. Before I had more time to admire this impressive feat of architecture, Jacek had already started dragging me into the building's spacious lobby. He went right up to the desk where an annoyed looking woman with short hair greeted him with little enthusiasm. Her mouth had been stitched shut, blood encrusting the seams. She couldn't talk properly, only pressing out short, muffled sentences. \n\n\"Hey Karen. Is the boss in?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she mumbled. \"He's in his tv room, I'll tell him you're coming.\"\n\n\"Thanks, you're a doll.\" Jacek led me up to another, smaller elevator, lighting a cigarette as he went.\n\n\"Is smoking indoors allowed here?\"\n\n\"It's strongly recommended.\"\n\nThis elevator ride was much more harmonious, but I was still getting more and more tense the higher we got. When the elevator finally dinged its arrival, I was shaking like a leaf. \"I'm going nuts,\" I confessed. \"Not to… make things awkward, but can you hug me again? Just for a second?\"\n\nJacek gave me a surprised look. Then, he wordlessly turned to me, removing his cigarette from between his lips to hold it far away from me as his other arm snaked around my waist. My throat had suddenly gone bone dry. I pressed myself up against him for a mere moment until he pulled back, chuckling awkwardly and moving to step out through the opening doors.\n\n\"Relax, the boss is chill. Okay, there we go.\"\n\nJacek led me and his jumpy dog down a couple corridors before finally stopping in front of a black door. He knocked and we waited for a beat until an annoyed-sounding voice told us to come in. Jacek held the door for me and we stepped inside. It was a nice, large room with a big flatscreen mounted to the wall and a cushy gray sofa facing it. While this room was a relatively tame sight, the person—or rather creature—standing in the middle of it instantly drew a scream from my throat.\n\nIt—*He*—was the size of a person, but at the same time that of a bull, or a football field, or maybe a whole continent, despite being able to fit into that room. He turned to us with a smile that had too many teeth and also none at all. When he opened his mouth to speak, I stared down into a black, endless hole. \n\nI didn't know what I was seeing. My mind was howling, trying to comprehend, trying to piece these conflicting impressions together. My thoughts were racing, my heart pounding; the longer I looked at this thing, the more everything seemed to spin out of control. I fell to my knees.\n\n*Why couldn't I understand this? Were my eyes deceiving me? Was this real? Was anything real? No, nothing was real anymore, nothing was true, nothing could be believed—*\n\n\"Oh, I see we've got company.\"\n\nA rich, gentle baritone cut through my frantic haze, and suddenly, I wasn't looking at something incomprehensible anymore. What was standing there in front of us wasn't a cosmic nightmare anymore. It was a man, leaning casually against the back of the couch. A normal-looking, middle-aged guy with a gray-streaked beard and an open, carefree smile. He was barefoot, only dressed in sweatpants and a T-shirt. \n\n\"Lovely. Jacek, I'll go out on a whim here and assume that this little firecracker is the infamous Fiona Novak?\"\n\n\"She is. Fiona, this is… well, my boss,\" Jacek said.\n\nI slowly got to my feet and walked over to the man, the *Devil*, reaching out to take his extended hand. It was warm and soft. \"It's a pleasure to meet you. Call me Nick.\"\n\n\"Hi,\" I croaked. \"It's, um, good to meet you, too.\"\n\n\"Sorry about before. I sometimes forget that my appearance is an acquired taste,” he said, squeezing my fingers with distinct pleasure. “So, as I am prone to understand, you’ve been brought here by Mr Hettmann to ask a favor of me.”\n\n\n“Yes, Sir. Uh, I mean Nick.”\n\nSuddenly, we were on the other side of the couch. We hadn’t moved an inch, not on our own accord, and yet, we found ourselves closer to the tv by several feet. The Devil plopped down, sighing contentedly. “Sit,” he commanded.\n\nJacek took a seat beside him and I followed suit, thankful for the shield my former boyfriend established between the Beast and myself. Despite not seeming put off by the unsettling nature of the other man in the slightest, he appeared to be acutely aware of my own discomfort.\n\n“Nice try, Jacuś.'' Without having gotten up, the Devil was now sitting by my other side, uncomfortably close. “I’ll thank you not to play the knight in shining armor. Now, Miss Novak. You’re not really an advocate or follower of mine, are you?” His tone didn’t sound accusatory in the least. “What makes you think you can come in here and accost me?” he asked genially.\n\nI squirmed uneasily, avoiding his gaze; not sure how to handle these conflicting messages. “I guess I just need help,” I stammered.\n\n“We all do sometimes.” The man put an arm around me, pulling me close and rubbing my shoulder.\n\nJacek jumped to his feet, staring at his employer in shock. The Devil laughed, letting go of me and waving him off. “Cool your jets, miller. If I wanted her, I would have had her already. Look at how she’s shrinking away.” He leaned forward, tapping Jacek’s belly. “If I wanted her, I could *make her like it.* Her response would be quite different then.”\n\nI couldn’t help but gag slightly in the back of my throat. I tried not to show it, tried to swallow it up—no use in antagonizing the being I was about to ask a huge favor of, as much as I would have liked to. Jacek lowered himself back down, chest heaving. The Devil regarded Jacek with unrestrained amusement. “Forgive me, son. But I simply had to know.”\n\n“Know what?” I inquired, feeling a tad dense.\n\nThe Devil shrugged. “Unimportant. Alright, Fiona, state your case. What is it that you want me to do for you?”\n\n“You command the Hidden People, don’t you? They pay you a toll, after all.”\n\n“Do go on.”\n\n“I have a plot of land. I need it to be *veiled* somehow, obscured by magical means. People have been trying and succeeding to access it.”\n\n“Thought of putting up a fence?”\n\n“Sure, but the Leshy doesn’t want that; he’d gut me. He’s a bit odd. Oh yeah, I have a Leshy on my land.”\n\nNick grinned. “You sure do. So, you want me to order the huldufólk to hide it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAn agonizing period of silence ensued. Then, the Devil shrugged. “Yeah, okay.”\n\n“What? That easy?”\n\n“Would you prefer I give you a series of inhumanely cruel tasks to complete in order to win my benevolence?”\n\n“N-no,” I hastened to reply. \n\n“Good. The woods shall be hidden from all except those you choose to inaugurate. Consider it done.” He gave me a cheerful smile. “You kids want a beer?”\n\n“Gladly,” Jacek muttered. The second the word had left his lips, he and I were both holding a large can of Guinness each. \n\n“Cheers.” The miller clinked his can against mine as I merely stared down at it in confusion. \n\n“And there’s nothing I have to do in return?” I asked Nick. “‘Cause you made it seem that way before.”\n\n“I did, didn’t I?” He smirked, clearly satisfied with himself. “No, no, don’t bother. Truth be told, I really like the Novak children. You’re my third-favorite.”\n\n“How come? We haven’t met before, have we?”\n\n“No. But let’s just say that I love the black miller very much, and he’s told me quite a bit about you.”\n\n“Oh. *Great*,” I gritted out, giving Jacek a sidelong glare that made him hide his face behind the drink.\n\n“I’ve already met your brothers, of course. That is to say, most of them.”\n\nI nearly spat out a mouthful of beer.\n\n“You needn’t look so surprised,” Nick remarked. \n\n“You’ve met Marian? Is he here?” I almost cried out.\n\n“No… The guy upstairs never lets me have any of the children. Well, most of the time, at least. He took Marian, and honestly, I’m happy he did! Little pest that he was. I came to see him when he was waiting in purgatory, and he kicked me in the shin and told me to go fuck myself, can you believe it?” He laughed quietly. “I remember it like it was yesterday. But that was before I learned more about you all. As for the one you call Casimir, I’m sure you’ll know where he’ll end up once his mortal body fails him.”\n\nI drew in a slow breath. “I suppose I can imagine.”\n\n“He’s a good boy. I’ll welcome him with open arms. The hunger that man displays, that unfeeling, lustful, entirely self-serving nature… Seems awfully devoted to you, though.” The Devil shrugged. “I watch him occasionally. I just love his coping mechanisms, you know. I appreciate that kind of behavior.”\n\n“I guess you would. Cas is a pretty winning guy.”\n\n“Definitely. And then there’s Jeremy.”\n\nI flinched so hard some beer spilled from my can. \n\nNick smiled very, very sweetly. “You haven’t seen that one in a bit, have you? Do you know what became of him?”\n\n“I never found out,” I confessed.\n\nThe Devil leaned in closer. “Want me to show you?”\n\n“Fiona, no,” Jacek chimed in. Turning to Nick, he added, “We should go now. Thanks for your time, boss. I’ll see you on Sunday.”\n\n“Wait! I wanna see.” It was against my own better judgment that I contradicted Jacek, but the truth of the matter was that I hadn’t seen or heard from Jem ever since he had cut contact with me and the rest of my family over a decade ago. I had tried to look him up a bunch of times but never found anything. Perhaps he’d chosen to change his name.\n\nJacek swallowed audibly. “It would really be better if you didn’t.”\n\nI was kind of surprised he would know anything about my younger brother, but before I could address his concerns, Nick had produced a remote and switched on the big tv across from us. I instantly pressed my hands over my ears as incoherent screaming and agonized wails rang out. The can of beer fell to the floor, its contents flowing freely over the carpet. More disturbing yet however was the image presented to me on screen. \n\nIt was a man, not much younger than me, resembling distinctly the memories I had of Jem in our youth. He was handsome, not quite as much as Casimir but definitely appealing; or rather, he must have been at some point. As it was, though, he looked almost like a living corpse. He was wholly nude, drenched in blood that streamed out of several gashes all over his body. Under different circumstances, he’d have probably already bled to death, but he was still standing, bleeding, bleeding, bleeding… \n\nHe was in a dimly lit holding cell; in the corner a pile of what I reluctantly identified as feces, and he kept throwing himself against the bars again and again, howling like a madman. It was horrifying beyond measure. I couldn’t say a thing, merely covering my eyes helplessly until Nick turned off the tv and the noises ceased.\n\n“Well, I reckon that was a bit distressing to see. But trust me, he’s getting what he deserves. I don’t take kindly to people who seek to topple humanity themselves. That’s my show to run.” He let go of a soft sigh. “Jeremy Novak, mass murderer. Never got caught to face a human jury, and after number forty-two, I just had to intercede. So I sent someone to prematurely collect his soul for me.” He gave me a swift pet on the knee. “And I bet you can guess who.”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1095w2g/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_freak_deer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a5ij3/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10b1dy9/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cac2n/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "  \n\nI was offered a role to work as a scientist by a man who calls himself Sokolov. I know that isn't his real name, he has gone by multiple names before. Mr.Rabbit, Vulcan, and Dennis to name a few. He isn't even the man who runs the experiments, he is just the face of it. Could be anybody funding these things, but that doesn't matter here. What matters here is that Sokolov is the body of an experiment that went horribly wrong. At least, that's what he wants us to think. \n\n   \n \n\nYou see these experiments lasted from to 7/16/22. They ran perfectly fine for a time. They started off with a dozen rabbits that had all they could ever want, food, water, shelter, other healthy mates. But that only lasted for about a week before someone that was instructed by Sokolov or whatever entity that had called upon to act, added another dozen rabbits. This repetition went on for a month. But then they stopped when the rabbits turned on each other. \n\n   \n \n\nAt first they would just show a hint of a aggression to another to express dominance I guess. But slowly it escalated. Scratches turned to bites, and injuries turned to murders. From the moment a dozen Xenos were added, they started to hate. And their hate was fueled. They had everything, yet they fought like they had nothing. But when word spread that the rabbits were quickly dying of themselves, and Sokolov told someone else to do something rather odd at first. \n\n   \n \n\nHe instructed them to purge all but a couple dozen rabbits with flame. To ration the food and water for the rabbits so that only the amount needed was given. To rid the rabbits of all their shelter. To sterilize the dozen rabbits that were left. To add a couple pregnant cockroaches into the habitat of the rabbits. And so, the purge was delivered. This was acted on the afternoon of 7/11/22. And so, I was there to watch, as the rabbits screamed from the hellfire that was administered slowly from a blowtorch that was handled by a complete stranger to me. \n\n   \n \n\nThe burned corpses were carried away to a unknown land, to never be viewed again in the state they were once seen as. The smell of burnt fur still lingered as we worked on 7/12/22. They added a few of the vermin inside of the enclosure. The pillagers proceeded to steal the limited resources of the rabbits, making them anxious as ever. Though, something was rather odd. Sokolov ordered a eradication of the vermin on the 7/14/22. \n\n   \n \n\nFor the longest time I thought they were just torturing the mammals, why help them? But soon the lives of the cockroaches were dismembered, saving the rabbits from anymore plague or famish. For the last 2 days of the experiment the last dozen rabbits were at peace. They were given resources a plenty, and the rain never stopped them from mating. For once and last, they were happy. \n\n   \n \n\nThe late afternoon of 7/16/22, they came into view of the lab. The lab surrounded the enclosure of the rabbits, with glass encasing them. The top of their habitat was fully open, leading to the air being somewhat moist from the harsh rain. The ones who came from the hallway of the lab were wearing swat team uniforms and faces so malicious that I could see them from behind their masks. The malice from when I saw Sokolov order the flame couldn't even hold a light to them. Their yells were a mixture of words that I hoped were \" DOWN TO THE GROUND, NOW! \". \n\n   \n \n\nAny disorder on the conduct they had commanded just now would surely end my entire view of reality. And so, I dropped under a table, hoping whatever team had sent them was on our side. Though sides don't really exist here. Only people who help you, and people who don't. In my mind I prayed that they would be gone. Everything was pretty much a spur. But from what I could recall, was them running out of the lab and into the location of Sokolov's office. Gunshots emerged, making every muscle in me flinch. \n\n   \n \n\nAnd as quickly as they entered my life, they exited. Peacefully, they went out the exit and to somewhere I shouldn't ever have knowledge of. All of us in the lab got up, hoping that they had no intentions of returning. We were lucky they never did. When the others ran away from this location of damnation, I turned. Turned to the office of Sokolov. For some reason I don't understand, I stumbled into the hallway leading there. Soon enough I was there, the office of the body. Blood soaked the walls and some of the floor. I wished I didn't see the body. I wished I wasn't so idiotic as to infest a room of what was danger moments before. As I looked in horror, gunshots riddled the corpse of sokolov. \n\n   \n \n\nHis image can't be removed from my brain. The detail of which I cannot describe but the broad strokes honor the fear in me. Trying not to regurgitate the food in me, I approached. I now know why I went there. To find answers. This experiment seemed so simple, yet it was hidden from everybody else and caused the death of whom had a part in it. I didn't pick and choose what papers fell into my hands, I just picked at random. In almost the blink of one’s eye, I was home. The night raided my household, yet the darkness couldn't stop me from reading everything I had pillaged. \n\n   \n \n\nI wasn't chosen because I was special or a good scientist. I was chosen because I was nobody. Look at me, a debt filled 20 something man with no family or friends uploading to a reddit horror sub, would anybody believe or.... I fear, even care? Sokolov wasn't anybody either, he was just a puppet for the network of our government to use, but he made a mistake for which I have also committed. He dismayed orders, he had given the rabbits peace. Though in doing so, he had severely helped the network. These documents have told me something. Something of which I cannot deal anything about. This experiment was for the idea of making a utopia within our world. This isn't a government or a subspace of them. Not anymore. Nothing I could say would put into words what this entails. Just know that soon. The purge of the Vulcan god will commence.",

        "text": "I'm going to be honest with you, I'm pretty sure I'm going to die in a log cabin in the middle of the woods, in a bed with a brown stain on the sheets, that is growing surprisingly fast as I look down at it. To be fair the stain was there before I got the large gashe in my stomach, with pieces of branches and dirt in my hair. And branches through my stomach..Hole? \n\nI'm going to say hole. Though my stomach is the worst injury I have, it's far from my only. I'm pretty sure my left leg is broken along with my right arm. There goes my night of fun for a few weeks. Well it might just be the rest of my life if things don't get any better. Maddie is telling John to keep pressure on my stomach while Liz tries to comfort Ken.. His freckled face is being covered by his hands while his brown hair comes down just above his ear… I don't like seeing his cry, somehow that makes me feel worse than the already life taking pain I'm in right now. \n\nJohn tried to take my phone out of my last good hand but I weakly moved it out of the way making the amazing sound of my best airplane noises. The wrinkles on his face from years of a life not lived so well. His nose moved as his green eyes rolled bad he shook his head. Then he gave me a look that could only be. \n\n\"Really kid?\" Or \"You're a dumbass\" knowing John. It was both. \n\nMaddie reached over to grab a bottle of alcohol. Unfortunately it was the burning the shit out of your cut kind and not the \"I forgot what it's like to be human\" kind. You're probably wondering why the hell am I spending time making this when I'm basically bleeding to death and to be honest..\n\n I don't know.. \n\nThe urge Just kinda came over me as Ken placed me in the bed. I'm rambling, but in my defense the pain is.. How do I put this.. Fucking awful. Like the worst type of pain that a person can feel without passing out. And the only reason I'm not passing out is because if I do I just might not wake up..\n\n I should probably start from before I got this whole in my chest and before I woke up to the sound of my alarm going off in my ear over and over. I thought about tossing the damn thing across the room when I remembered that I actually wanted to get up this morning. Because I started my new job today. It was a rather new experience for me. \n\nI'm the newest member of the Canny Valley National Park, a place full of a bunch of weird and messed up stuff. Canny is a place both in the middle of nowhere and also full with more people then you would realize. Canny is named after the explorer and first manor of the town. Nathan J. Canny ``discovered\" this place nestled between a mountain range with two being on opposite sides of each other with the valley in the middle. Thick woods circle the town to the point where you can walk 10ft without running into a tree.  Hell, one day Mr.Willson had a whole redwood fall on his shed. The damn thing shocked the whole town when it fell. It took them a full week to move the thing, but at least now Mr.Willson is enjoying the new all wood Workshop in the back of his yard. The river Stic flows through part of the town until it all runs together in Lake Aster. \n\nI started working here after I graduated from highschool about 4 months ago. College was an opinion but I lost all motivation for anything that had to do with school after the pandemic made us all couch potatoes. Now I'm not from Canny myself. Originally I'm from the city but there's only so many buildings you can look at, draw and count before you go insane. Writing helped a lot for a bit, just random things that come to my mind and working on that great American novel every housewife swears she's on the verge of. \n\nThings didn't get much better until business started opening back up. On my way around applying to every job in a 5 mile radius via a mix of walking, biking and a very socially distancing bus ride, I stop for lunch at a coffee shop a few blocks down from my place. I walked inside passing a table with a man and a woman both giving the \"we're trying not to make a scene\" face. One obviously came here to break up with the other.\n\n I hated the tension that came in waves from them so I quickly made my way to the front counter. I was in line with a number of overly normal looking people. A couple of college students that looked like they were straight out of a night of red bull, over-thinking and a mess of late papers. There was a woman with a stare that gave out the, \"This line better move before I get the manager\" vibe. And I didn't want to be around that nightmare. \n\n\nWhen I got to the front of the line I just ordered a mocha and took a seat on the side of the restaurant near a window. I was enjoying my cup of coffee while I reflected on the shear about rejection letters I would get over the next few days, when I saw something that caught my eye.  It was a help wanted sign. I walked over to the bulletin board that had a number of different posters on it. A few lost dog posters, a flier for something that called The way of Tytis ,which was probably a clut; promotional advertisements for new drinks coming with the change of the season (No doubt reeking of pumpkin), and one of those 1-800 numbers that is no doubt a scam. \n\n\nIt took me longer than I felt comfortable emitting to actually find the help wanted sign I saw but I finally did, with a little help from them..\n\nWhat was I talking about again? It's very hard to remember what I saw while Maddie pulls a branch from my leg. Now that's I sight you never see every day, and the most fucked up part about it that I can't feel a fucking thing down there. So just image you're pulling out a little splinter only to pull out a fucking log. That's the face I imagine I'm making right now.  Hopefully I'm just too much in shock to feel it but the alternative is VERY VERY bad. Yeah I don't want to think about that. \n\nFuck, I got a little off track there. Anyway the sign was for a new ranger for Canny Valley National Park. Now I've been a city boy for most of my life. Hell, I barely know how to make a smoker let alone pitch a tent, but I have always wanted to be out in the great outdoors. The feeling of being discontinued from what country is doing what, who's cheating on who and whatever the hell Twitter is. So I took the flier. \n\nAfter a couple of hours I made my way home passing a few street performers, and nearly got hit by a bus. In my defense I have a big problem with going in and out of autopilot. When I was younger I wasn't exactly the best kid but to be fair my classmates were little assholes. Yes I was bullied but I did fight back. I once saw a group of girls throw our class hamsters out of a window. \n\n\nI really liked that little guy.. \n\nAnyway when I got home I talked to my mom about it, and gotta tell ya. That it was an uphill battle and you're being stabbed over and over again in the shins, while on fire. I understand all of her concerns, I really do. Being one of the only children my mom had. My little sister and I were all she had left in the world after my father passed a few years ago. And it was honestly one of my main reasons for wanting the job in the first place. I wanted to make a lot of money by just making sure a few campers don't get lost in the woods. It doesn't sound too bad. Of course I knew there was more to it than that, but I never expected this.. \n\nAnyway let's just skip the part where I had to explain everything to my mom and my little sister. Trust me we'll save a lot of time plus the meds are starting to kick in and I really want to at least get to my first day here. When I actually took the time to look up where it was, of course not telling my mom I didn't look into the place before, but I couldn't find a location.\n\n I scrolled through the website for over an hour but didn't see any.  All the regular information and requirements were there. Name, age, social security, background, and a section that said now pier experience is not needed but basic first aid and search &amp; recurve skills will give you a higher chance of being hired. Under this it was a number to call the Ranger station for more information. \n\nI called the number list on the website and after not even one ring someone picked up. \n\n\"This is Madison with Canny Valley National Park Service, how may I help you?\" A kind female voice came from the phone along the side of papers moving.\n\n\n\"HI, I'm calling about one of your fliers. I wanted to apply for a park ranger position. \" I said with a bit more nervousness than I wanted. \n\n\"That's wonderful to hear. We've had the position out for a while now. We'd love to have you a part of our team here. May I have your email so I can send you the paperwork?\"\n\n\"Oh sure it's.\" \n\nNot telling you my email. \n\nShe went silent for a moment then I heard a notification sound from my phone. \n\n\"I just sent the email to you all the paperwork you need to fill out along with our employment requirements. I hope to hear from you again if you have any questions. You have a good day Michael. \"\n\n\"I'll make sure to call if I have any. You had a good day- wait, how did you?\"\n\nIt kind of freaked me out that she knew my name without me saying it and honestly it freaked me out even more when I sent in my application and got hired immediately. It turns out that Canny was just a state over, plus the city I lived in was right on the board of the two so It was only a few hours of driving. I told them I could probably just take a bus or plane ticket there but they inserted one of their rangers to come get me. Madison told me that they'd send John (one of their senior Rangers) to get me and that he'd be here next week.  \n\nA week later I was sitting in my living room with my mom giving me my hundredth hug. When we heard a knock on the door. I walked over and opened to see a tall middle aged man with salt and pepper hair. Now to say he was in good shape for his age would be an understatement because he was in good shape for any age. Imagine one of those old Greece statue and you will have close to an idea of how ripped with guy was. He wore a button up shirt with two pockets on the chest area, a lot with dark green pants and some wore looking hiking boots. \n\n\"Excuse me, are you Michael?\" \n\n\"Yeah that's me. John, right?\"\n\nHe reached his hand out to shake. I reached out my hand to return the gesture and reserved a handshake that was more gentle than I thought it would be. I invited John inside to receive the same interrogation that I received from my mom for the past week. She walked over to him and reached out her hand to shake his hand and pulled him down on the couch to sit next to her. It was really funny to see the look on his face as my small and petite mother pulled him down with no effort. \n\n\"So, Mr?\"\n\n\"Baker, but you can just call me John.\"\n\n\"Well it's nice to meet you John. I'm Katharine but you can call me Kat. Now I just have a few questions for you.\"\n\nNow when I say that my mom got this Man life story, I mean I now know exactly where he used to sit in the fourth Grade and how he still to this day doesn't like the crust on his sandwiches, or pizza. Plus the names of his three daughters, Susan (who was the oldest), Jessica (who was a sheriff's Deputy in Canny) and Mary (was actually my age, but was in Virginia for school.)\n\nAfter another hour of hugs from my mom, John and I were finally in his red 2019 Ford F-150 on the road headed out to Canny. \n\nI watched as the city fading away into open fields, summer in the Midwest was always nice to see. Back when I was younger my dad would take us out here for picnics. It was one of the memories that I hold on to tightly when I think of him. \n\nWe passed the field after a few for about an hour when I finally pulled my consciousness from wherever it goes when I space out and I sat up my seat and yawned.\n\n\"You're finally awake? I thought you'd sleep the whole trip to be honest with you. Most new people stay up all night nervous and end up passing out in that very seat you're in right now.\" \n\nJohn looked. Over for a second then hand me an energy drink. \n\n\"Flavour Blash X? I have never seen this brand before. What flavor is X even supposed to be grape?\"\n\n\"It's Cherry actually.\" He said with a smile that reminded me of the one my dad would get when showing him the art I used to make in school. I pushed the thought away as I drank some of the drink and it wasn't bad actually. It was actually really good and I felt a lot less sleepy. \n\n\"Oh. It actually is cherry.\" \n\nAfter about five more minutes, passing fields and listening to country music (that I hated but didn’t say not to be rude)  I decided to strike up another conversation to avoid  the awkwardness of being in a car with someone you don't know. \n\n\"So, how long have you lived in Canny?\" \n\n\"I've lived in the Valley for most life. My family's been there since the town was founded and I never found a reason to leave for long. Well, except for a vacation with my family. \"\n\n\"Have you ever been to any other countries? I bet the culture shock can be a bit much for someone who's only lived in one place their whole life.\"\n\n\"Just because I'm from The Valley doesn't mean I didn't travel when I was younger. I've been to a number of countries in Europe and Asia and a few in the Pacific.\"\n\n\"I am not asking you to be a couch potato or anything but I didn't take the travel type. \" I said with genuine surprise in my voice. This guy has been all over the world and probably knows a couple different languages and decided to be a boring old park ranger. And I was going to comment on it when he beat me to it. \n\nHe let out a long sigh, one that held the air of someone tired beyond belief. He turned to look at me and as he did it looked as if he aged 10 years in a matter of a few seconds. \n\n\"Look Michael, you are a good kid and usually newcomers get cold feet around this time. This is the part where I tell you that this job isn't going to be easy..You have to give a hundred percent, hundred percent of the time. You never know when you will get the call to help look for someone who's gone missing in the woods. Of course it's not a big deal at first. Probably just a camper who got a little turned around on their way back from making friends with a tree. \"\n\nThe sun hit the sides of my eye as the earlier morning faded to noon and I started to sweat from both the heat and the nervousness from the dramatic shift in the conversation. \n\n“You look around for them for a bit; an hour turns into two, then three, then four, when you look up it's been a day and now things need to get serious. The family gets more and more worried and now you have half of the sheriff's department and most of the town looking for them. Day after day, little by little people lose hope and so do you. At a certain point your mind switches from looking for a person, to a body. Even then there are times where you don’t find anything; no person, no body, no clothes, no shoes, just nothing..”\n\nThe weight of his words fill the car and my mind with equal quietness and value. \n\n\"Now I'm not trying to scare you off, well maybe some little part of me is subconsciously but those are just the facts of it. If that's too much for you and you want to head back now there is no shame in that.\"\n \nI stayed quiet for a moment honestly thinking how to respond. I knew the job won’t be easy and I planned to take it as seriously as a person could but even after hearing that, I did consider giving up. \n\nThe four-laned highway slowly turned into two as the sprinkle of passing trees started to pour over into a thick forest that surrounded the car on both sides of the road. The forest stretched as far as the horizon, as two mountains guarded opposite sides of the valley. The sun hung longer in the sky just above the trunk leaving no shadows in its wake. I looked out the window still pondering his words until an idea came to mind. \n\n“How about this? Give me one month to learn and get used to the swing of things and if both of us feel like I can't handle it then I'll be on the first bus back to the city. Deal?” \n\nJohn made a face that was a mix of contemplation and maybe constipation? Anyway he took a turn that seemed to come out of nowhere and we headed down making the whole trunk bounce, which made me jump a little in my seat. And i'm not afraid to admit i might have yelp a like a lost puppy but you didn't feel how fast he made that turn to you can respectfully fuck off. John laughed for a minute. Before wiping the tears from his eyes and focusing more on the road.\n\n“I’m glad you’re getting a kick out of my fear.” I said, pulling myself back into my seat in my more comfortable pistons.\n\n“It’s not that, I just forget how that turn can take out of towners by surprise. I swear I could have one hell of a photo album of all the different faces and positions people have learned in after that turn. Then that yelp was just downright adorable. ”  \n\n“That yelp was just downright adorable! Can you just focus on driving please??” \n\nJohn laughed again and continued down the road for another few minutes as the dirt slowly turned from back to pavement. We continued down the road to see a building coming to view along with a sign that read “Welcome To CannyValley, Population” . Now I might have been seeing things well, not really what I saw but more of what I didn’t rather could see. For some reason I couldn’t read the population number and the weirdest part about that is even though i couldn’t read it; I knew it went up.",

        "text": "At seventeen, my brother Brad had a stroke and woke up trapped in his body. The doctors diagnosed him with Locked-In Syndrome: a rare neurological disease that paralyzes all muscles except those that control eye movement. If you ask me, it’s a fate worse than death. \n\nBefore his stroke, Brad was everything I wanted to be: athletic, outgoing, and a hit with the ladies. I was the complete inverse. My classmates were shocked when they found out we were related. \n\nBrad and I had a strained relationship. I was envious of what he had and he was ashamed of what I was — a social outcast with a pension for saying the wrong thing. I’d like to say we grew closer after his diagnosis, but we didn’t.\n\nHis well-being become my parents' obsession and eventually destroyed their marriage. Our family was in tatters and I didn’t hide my resentment. Brad knew it, and his hatred for me grew. \n\nSometimes I’d be tasked with changing his clothes, and if my mom was too tired, his diaper as well. The stares he gave me made my blood run cold. His eyes were pits of darkness. I knew he wanted me dead without a word passing from his lips. \n\nIt didn’t help that my life changed for the better as his went the other way. I started to lift weights and grew into my lanky frame. Girls started to notice me and I made friends with the popular kids. I became the “new Brad”, even hanging out with some of his old buddies. Brad seethed with jealous rage. I could feel it bursting from his every pore. I’m sure he felt like I stole his life, and in a way, I did. The truth was that Brad getting sick was the best thing that ever happened to me. \n\nThat all changed on one fateful night. I had stumbled home late from a party at Brads ex-girlfriends house — who I was hooking up with. I was tipsy and beaming with joy. As I passed by Brad's room, I stopped dead in my tracks. Hush whispers floated into the hallway. \n\n“I can give you it all back. Everything you lost can be reclaimed. But nothing in life is free. Are you willing to pay the price?”\n\n“Y….e….s….”\n\n“What a pleasure to hear. Such a smart boy. Let me give you a taste of what’s to come. This one’s on the house.”\n\nI stood frozen in the hallway. What was I hearing? I cupped my ear to the door and listened intently. \n\nJoyful sobs echoed from his room. “I don’t care what the price is. I’ll do anything. This is worth it” \n\nI took a step back and covered my mouth to repress a shocked squeal. That was Brad's voice. There was no mistaking it. Its deep timbre and gruff edges were unmistakable. \n\n“I thought you’d feel that way. God has taken so much from you and I’m here to give it back. All I ask is a soul for a soul. Blood for blood.” \n\n“Gladly. I’ve been dreaming of this moment for years.”\n\nFootsteps crept across the bedroom floor. The way they bounced against the hardwood sounded like clogs. A rush of cold air passed over me. The lights in the house flickered. Shadows twisted and reveled in the darkness. \n\n“It is done. You have half an hour. If a soul has not been claimed by then, your body becomes a prison once again.”\n\n“Not a problem. You’ll have your soul. Blood will be spilled, and I’ll be the one to do it.” \n\nMy heart started racing and my muscles tensed. I snuck into my room, turning the lock. Holding my breath, I slid under my bed and gripped a pocket knife I kept in my bedside drawer. \n\nBrad was a mountain of a man. If he gunning for me, I stood no chance against him. My best bet was to hide and pray to whoever would listen. The man was an animal; The junkyard dog was off the leash and I was red meat. \n\nFootsteps raced down the hall and lurched to a stop in front of my room. “Hey bro! You’re not gonna believe this — I’m cured. It’s a miracle! Let me in. I want to show you the new me.”\n\nI didn’t budge. My lips quivered with fear. I embraced the darkness as a shield of protection. \n\n“Didn’t you hear me. I’m all better! Come on and let me in. I want to have a brother-to-brother chat. We’re long overdue.” His tone was sickly sweet. \n\nI remained quiet. My fingers wrapped fiercely around the handle of the pocket knife. Stuffed into a pile of foul-smelling clothes, I waited in anticipation.\n\nBrad began to knock, calling for me. The knocking grew progressively more intense. Soon, it turned into fists slamming against the door. I could hear the wood splintering as his rage spilled into open view. \n\n“Open the fucking door!” He repeated over and over again. \n\n*BOOM.* The frame splintered. Seconds later, it burst open. A faint light from the hallway spilled in, mostly blocked by Brad's massive frame. \n\n“Here’s Braddy!” He laughed sinisterly at his joke. “Come out, come out wherever you are.”\n\n“Twenty minutes left Brad.” A voice echoed from somewhere unseen. \n\n“I know you’re in here. Why are you hiding me you fucking little bitch! Aren’t you happy that I’m all better?” The rage simmering below the surface boiled over. Brad turned over my desk and screamed with primal fury. \n\nI lay motionless. If Brad found me there was little I could do. He began to tear through my closet, throwing clothes across the floors.\n\n“Found you!” Brad's head popped underneath the bed. His face was twisted in a wicked smile. “We need to have a talk bro.” \n\nHis burly arm grabbed my collar. As he pulled me into the open, I plunged the knife into his hand. Brad wailed in pain. His face turned bright red, practically foaming at the mouth. \n\nI rolled over to my side and shot to my feet. Before I could make it a foot, Brian kicked my legs out from underneath me. Falling to the floor, I grabbed for anything to catch myself. My fingers landed on the knife. It fell with me, leaving behind a gaping hole in Brad's hand. He didn’t even flinch. \n\n“I’ve wanted to say something to you for years. You looked down on me ever since my life went to shit. You loved finally being better than me. That all changes tonight.” Brad towered over me. His smirk said it all. \n\nI coughed up blood as Brad kicked me repeatedly in the ribs. Stars filled my vision. \n\n“Please….Im sorry….don’t do this…” I gurgled through a mouthful of blood. \n\n“Sorry? No, you’re not sorry — you’re begging.” Brad picked up a weight I’d propped against the wall. “Lifting weight now, huh? That’s my thing, bro.” \n\nBrad lifted the weight high over his head. He stood there silently, relishing the moment. \n\n“Ten minutes left.” A velvety voice whispered from the shadows. \n\n“I only need one,” Brad replied smugly. \n\nHowling with laughter, Brad swung the weight towards my temple. Almost simultaneously I flailed my legs and connected with his shin. His momentum sent him hurdling forward. The weight missed my head by inches and Brad crashed on to me.\n\nA torrent of blood stained my shirt. Brad had fallen directly on the pocket knife, piercing his chest; a happy accident. He gasped for air, lungs filling with fluid. Within a minute he stopped breathing. The twisted look of hatred never left his face. Even in death, his eyes were trained on me with laser-like focus.\n\nA faceless entity stepped out of the darkness. Its cloven feet clicked against the hardwood, black wings caressing the ceiling. Long, spindly fingers interlocked, tapping against each other. \n\n“You bastard; you goddamn bastard. A soul for a soul?” I yelled \n\n“No need for such harsh words child. You took the same deal all those years ago. Isn’t it only fair your brother would get the same opportunity?” Its words dripped with sadism. \n\n“You said I could have his life! I paid your price. You told me this was forever.”\n\n“Oh, but it is — but that only extends to Brad's life. You see I didn’t offer him his life back; I offered him yours. He didn’t take me up on it though. Another life was just taken. What happened here was pure revenge.”\n\nThe entity pointed a skeletal finger down the hall. Heart racing, I made my way to my mother’s room. I pushed open the door and screamed.\n\nMy mom was dead. A frothy substance pooled around her mouth. An overturned cup of tea lay next to her. Her eyes were blood red, limbs splayed in a tortured position. She’d died in horrible agony, that much was clear.\n\n“The deal has been accepted. Two brothers damned to the same fate. I’ll make my leave now. See you soon; sooner than you think.\n\n“Hey bro. Have you seen mom?” A cold hand clutched my shoulder and the world started to spin.",

        "text": "Hello, I know this is strange. There's so many stories about people's experiences with things that go bump in the night. It's not very often that you get a story like this. A story from a thing that goes bump in the night. \n\nWell I'm not exactly a thing that goes bump in the night I guess. If you met me in person, you wouldn't think me any different than any other trucker that you've ever met in your life. I am awkward and very antisocial. I like to be in quiet places. I should probably put a forward here and say that My story is not gory. I'm not a vampire. I'm not a werewolf. And if those were your first guesses, you would be wrong. I was classified as an entity when I was 14 years old. My neighborhood was visited by a caravan of black Humvees and a beta version of the Sonic devices that they use today for military crowd control. The Sonic device that they were using was a little different though. It was capable of putting people to sleep. It was also capable of wiping their memory. If you tune the frequency just right, it's not that hard. \n\nWhen they came to my house. The men in black military drab aimed their guns at me like I was some kind of monster. But their leader wasn't at all afraid of me and I wasn't afraid of him either. He said to me \"when we're done with you, you won't remember any of this\" and my reply to this was \"You want to bet?\" It's funny because I always say this to everybody because I'm always right. I did end up remembering him a year or two later. I can even tell you about The scar on his chin. I was classified as entity 38. One of the very few human entities. Most of the entities that they classify are hybrids, evolutionary breakaways, beings from other universes, or ancient alien gods. \n\nI got my classification because of a unique skill I have. I learn. I don't just learn. I learned very fast. And I don't stop learning. Generally, adults gradually slow down and their capacity to learn dwindles as they age. That isn't how it is for me. It's not that I'm a math guru or linguistics master. I could be those things if I wanted to be If I spent half my time working on them. Not really interested in those things. I'm very interested in quantum physics. But I come at quantum physics from a different angle than most. I studied philosophy and from the angle philosophy derived that I could actually solve a lot of the issues with critical thinking. And I did. And from that angle I was able to prove multiverse theory. Now you might be thinking didn't they do papers on that several years ago? Yes, but most of the groundwork actually came from several scientists who were active on my Facebook group back in 2010 and 2012. I'm not here to brag. I'm here to tell you secrets. That's what I do. That's what I'm good at. That's ultimately my real interest. It's where I really put my education and my understanding of the universe to the test.\n\nThey call me a hyper intelligence, some of them call me Mr. Know-it-all, I don't care what they call me. I just like to be free. You're probably thinking If he's an entity, shouldn't he be more dangerous. And you're right. You're absolutely right. I'm extremely dangerous. In fact, I could end the world. I am actually one possibility for the end of the world. There are a bunch of possibilities. A lot of things could end the world. You don't really realize it. But when you factor a lot of this stuff. A small particle of dust moving at Just the right speed past the speed of light and boom, the end of the world. What's funny to me is that most people don't notice that the world is already ended a few times and we never noticed it. Well I noticed it. \n\nWhat makes me dangerous Is captivity. As long as I'm free I have no reason to try and understand reality bending. Oh believe me it's on the forefront of my mind every moment I exist. I want to understand how to bend reality. Truly I do. But only when I lose my freedom and I'm put in a box. Would I have a true reason to bend my way out of that box? You see, I am a hyper intelligence but more than that my hyper intelligence is bordering on reality bending. And when I figure it out, everything changes. \n\nI'm not saying I would actually end the world. I actually like the world. I don't like all the conflicts. And I don't like everyone fighting each other. But I might make some changes. Reality Restructuring. I think the only change I'd actually make would be to force the entire living universe to share all of their experiences In 5 minutes. 5 minutes of a unified consciousness. Every living being to exist in this universe. I think that's reason enough for The alphabet agencies of the world to truly fear putting me in a box. I don't think anyone wants to share their experiences with others. I mean we all say we do. We all say we want someone who understands us. But what if you were forced to share all of your experiences with the entire universe...\n\nI'm not evil. Or at least I don't think I am. I honestly think I would do this to heal the world, heal the universe. There are galactic entities that don't exactly have our best interests in mind. They actually consider humans to be a slave species. And I don't really like that. I think those galactic entities are more evil than I am. I'm just your universe's version of lex luthor. I'm just thinking in the best interest of the species. I do truly care about the human species. Because it's me. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me. I love secrets. And if you want to know something, don't be afraid to ask. Go deep. Ask about a conspiracy theory. I can't read minds. Well that isn't exactly true. I've read minds a few times but I'm not good at it yet. But I can tell you how you can do it. I can tell you where the portals are. I can tell you about how the The scientific community has discovered multiversal communication. They're using quantum entanglement on phase particles, in essence, they've built a cup on a string between universes. I can even tell you that the universes that they're talking to are nearly exactly identical to our own aside from a few particles. I can tell you that I'm not the only entity that reads Reddit. There are a lot of things that come on to Reddit to keep score. Yes, you read that right. Reddit is used by entities to keep score. Not that. That's what I'm doing. I'm just here to be seen.\n\nSo if you're on the road in the middle of the night and you stop at a truck stop and you see a ragged 30 something year old man. Don't be afraid to ask him questions.",

        "text": "Have you ever seen *We Bought A Zoo*? I used to love that film. I repeatedly watched it when I was a kid, and I truly envied Matt Damon. I wanted to be him. Maybe I just wanted Scarlett Johansson. I don’t know. I’m getting sidetracked.\n\nI was once transfixed by the pristine Polaroid of the American dream that *We Bought A Zoo* created, even though the story was based on a British family. Maybe Hollywood should purchase the rights to *my* tale of a dilapidated park’s renovation. I’ve a hunch it might not reach the pitching floor.\n\nNow, obviously, *any* abandoned place is creepy. *We Bought A Zoo* added whimsy and wonder to the experience, but that wasn’t realistic. There was an eerie atmosphere to the derelict farm that I transformed into an adventure park. Perhaps it was compounded by the fact that I didn’t have Scarlett Johansson by my side.\n\nI wasn’t entirely alone. My family came to my aide. We hired people and brought my vision of an adventure park to life. For obvious reasons, I’m going to change names throughout this post. My sister, Josie, was magnificent. My friend, Paul, was a lifesaver in every meaning of the word. Uncle Ron, however, just wanted a slice of the pie.\n\nAnyway, I want to talk about the horrible events that led to the closure of my park.\n\n**The Ghost Train Incident:**\n\nWe opened the park gates in June. May was a manic month, as you can probably imagine. I was hiring as many people as possible to get everything up and running. There was so much to do that I could hardly keep on top of every single problem.\n\nTess worked on the Ghost Train ride. She was setting up decorations and lighting throughout the tunnels. One Friday night in May, she came running to me in floods of tears. Gary, the train engineer, had gone home early, leaving Tess on her lonesome in the darkened tunnels. She had the fright of her life when she spotted something that she didn’t put there.\n\nAn animatronic in a purple pinafore.\n\nTess described the machine as a short girl with a grey face, baby-blue eyes, and the menacing mouth of a metallic nutcracker. It was nearly ten in the evening, and I was too tired to deal with yet *another*issue. Some of the other late-night workers teased Tess, and I admit that I thought she must just be confused. I assumed that another member of staff had installed the animatronic.\n\nBegrudgingly, a few of us accompanied Tess to the Ghost Train tunnels, and we were unsurprised to find no sign of her mechanical ghoul. The girl was distraught, and I originally thought that was due to the incessant mocking from her co-workers.\n\nBut Tess told me something, after the others had left. She said the animatronic spoke. The mechanical girl said things that only Tess knew about herself. The machine made callous remarks, but its comments soon escalated to terrible threats. *That* was what had shaken Tess up. I told her it was probably a horrible prank from one of her co-workers.\n\nShe didn’t come into work the next day. Nobody could get in contact with her. We just assumed the girl had quit without saying anything. I feared the financial burden of a harassment lawsuit, due to the workplace bullying, but what actually happened was worse. The following day, Tess’ mother came into the office and spoke to Paul. He later told me that her daughter had been missing since Friday night. The mother was wondering whether anyone had seen her go home. We hadn’t.\n\nThe entire situation gave me chills. Uncle Ron was simply peeved that Tess had left us in the lurch right before opening, but I had a dreadful feeling about the whole situation. That sickening pit in my stomach was only deepened by Paul’s incessant comments about the farm being built on unhallowed ground. Old local tales. He had warned me not to purchase the abandoned land.\n\nI explored the Ghost Train ride for clues as to the girl’s disappearance. I didn’t find Tess, but I found something that was, perhaps, much worse.\n\nThe animatronic. It was real.\n\nThe machine with a malicious smile hadn’t been there when Tess led us through the tunnels. I hadn’t believed it actually existed. Seeing it with my own eyes, I have never in my life been quite so petrified. Her purple pinafore, most horrifyingly, was covered in blood. I cried in terror and immediately fled the tunnels.\n\nUncle Ron urged me to keep quiet about the entire ordeal. He forced me back into the Ghost Train building, and we dragged the animatronic outside. My uncle loaded the unnatural machine onto the back of his truck and coldly warned me to keep my lips sealed. He wasn’t going to let “a prank” ruin his “investment”, even though I had invested far more into the park.\n\nA few weeks later, we opened to the public.\n\n**D-11:**\n\nAisle D, Seat 11. The cursed seat.\n\nThe jousting performance was one of our most popular attractions, and people were far too enthralled by the knights and jesters to notice the woman in D-11 who was hit in the face with an airborne child’s shoe. The culpable child, who had thrown his shoe behind him in excitement, was forced to apologise, but the fuss quickly dissipated. The bloody-nosed woman left to clean herself up.\n\nIt was Josie who first made a comment about the seat being “cursed”. The following week, we faced a slightly more serious incident in D-11. A young boy violently choked on his sandwich. Fortunately, somebody dislodged the food item, but the boy’s ribs were broken in the midst of the commotion. His unconscious body was carried out on a stretcher. I heard he made a full recovery.\n\nTwo days later, something happened that finally prompted us to get rid of the seat. Paul tore it from the cement. I’m not a superstitious person, but the final incident was horrifying enough to make me question the very nature of the universe. Sitting in D-11, a young man, who was perfectly healthy, according to reports and local rumours, suffered a fatal heart attack. Coroners had little to say, allegedly.\n\n“These things happen.”\n\nThey happened far too often in D-11.\n\n**Blind Spot:**\n\nThis was the penultimate event to the tragedy which led to my park’s closure. Two children went missing on the obstacle course in the woods.\n\nNobody’s sure how they could have possibly vanished. There were so many people around. The woods were fenced, as was the entire park. The two boys simply slipped between some trees and were never seen again. On the leaf-strewn clearing in which they disappeared, we found something inexplicably dreadful. Two child-sized mannequins lay on the ground, and they were wearing the clothes of the missing children.\n\n**The Blueberry Man:**\n\nThis is something direful that only came to light after the park’s closure, and it certainly sparked a serious inquest. Many people still link this incident to the tragedy of the missing children from the obstacle course. I’m not so sure about that. It’s certainly a terrible story, though.\n\nThe blueberry man was not a member of my staff. My employees and I first became aware of his existence when children started to excitedly gush about delicious blueberry ice creams and even blueberry *pies* that they had enjoyed at our park. At first, I would chuckle at the bizarreness of such comments. We didn’t sell blueberry products of any kind.\n\n“Yes, you do,” One kid told me. “The blueberry man’s stand is behind the petting farm!”\n\nMembers of staff tirelessly searched for this illegal stand, but nobody ever found the “blueberry man” behind the farm.\n\nWeeks later, after the park closed, a man was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of a child. In his basement, alongside a corpse that was mutilated beyond recognition, there were tubs of blueberries in a small fridge.\n\nWhat truly haunts me is that one of the responding officers, who is a friend of mine, said the man blubbered and insisted it wasn’t his fault. He said something in the woods made him do it. Something old.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe park closed as the result of *many* horrifying incidents. I’ll post about other terrible things that happened. That being said, I don’t know whether I have the courage to tell the tale of the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nI’m also not sure that you would *want* to know it.",

        "text": " \n\nMy name is Seb and I live in a bachelor apartment by myself. I prefer living by myself because with roommates you never really own anything. I have my dodge charger and a job at the local fish gutting plant.\n\nOne weekend morning I decided to visit my friend Brandon. Brandon was like me, with a slightly darker complexion. He lived with his roommate Brandon. The second Brandon was a slow fellow. Often playing games on hsi phone for hundreds of hours.\n\nI opened the door to see them sitting there smoking weed and watching our favourite show, evangelion.\n\nSlow Brandon chugged a beer.\n\n“Get em shingi!” Slow Brandon yelled.\n\nDark Brandon took a toke.\n\n“Man this show gets better with every viewing! There is so much subtext swirling in my head.” Dark Brandon chortled.\n\nWe watched in a trance for what felt like hours. All our favourite characters battling against the allegedly evil angels.\n\nWhen we got to the part with Asuka getting mind raped I started to wonder about Sarah.\n\n“I thought you said Sarah was coming over dude?” I said after a toke.\n\n“Dude we need to watch the first half of the end of evangelion first dude” Dark Brandon responded.\n\n“Why?” I asked.\n\n“Dude, never watch the first half of the end of evangelion with a woman you care about! They will never look at you the same way again.” He said mournfully.\n\nWe finished the show other than messed up last two episodes that aren’t canon and watched the first half of the end of evangelion.\n\nAs we watched the plug suit eva eat Asuka Dark Brandon got a dreamy look in his eye.\n\n“You know the plug suit Eva is real dude. If you finish the puzzle he takes a bite out of you they say. If you finish it twice he takes a REAL bite out of you. They say nothing hurts more.” Dark Brandon recited.\n\n“That's not real!” Slow Brandon Chimed in. “Our technology couldn’t do that!”\n\n“Man, let's complete the puzzle Dude. The first bites not that bad. Lets watch em all dude.” Dark Brandon responded.\n\nWe put on the second half of the end of evangelion and it started to screw with our heads, forming a strange horrifying picture.\n\n“I can’t see it!” Slow Brandon yelled.\n\n“We need more pieces!” Dark Brandon yelled.\n\nAfter we finished it we started watching the last two non canon episodes of the show. Before long there was a knock at the door.\n\n“Hey Seb!” Sarah waved.\n\n“Hey Sarah. I mean you can stay if you want but we are up to some occultist shit. We are going to get bit by a crazy monster to see how much it hurts.” I said as a warning.\n\n“You and magic shit! Have you taken your meds?” Sarah said scornfully.\n\nI rolled my eyes and we cuddled while we watched the show. I don’t think she’s even seen the end of evangelion, she should be fine.\n\nAfter our minds were fucked like Asuka’s we put on death and rebirth.\n\n“This is the one that gets you they say. I’ve seen everything else a million times and so have you guys. WE have to make a pact right now to NEVER watch this movie again or we get the real bite.” Dark Brandon Sneered.\n\nOur minds were tormented by images of Shinji’s father, the most despicable man to never live.\n\nHim and his wife in random scenes that were out of order.It was like an entire season of a show into 1 90 minutes mind fuck.\n\nNear the end the movie stopped and plug suit Eva sat on the screen smiling at us all.\n\n“You don’t seem very scary” Slow Brandon said, after spitting out his beer.\n\nI sat there scared for a second, but the Eva didn’t seem to want to do anything.\n\nThen translucent TV screens appeared in front of me and the Brandon’s. There were a bunch of translucent people as well, with the plug suit Eva on their faces. The one that looked like Sarah freaked me out.\n\n“Congratulations!” They all chortled, laughing hysterically.\n\nThe plug suit Eva laughed on all 3 screens and lunged forward like translucent snakes, taking a bite out of each of us.\n\nAll 3 of us cried out in unison. It hurt about as much as being stabbed with a knife.\n\nThe eva laughed “The real bite is 20,000 times worse. And I’m going to get one of you!”\n\nThe tv’s disappeared and I jumped up. All this pain had given me a weird energy.\n\nDark Brandon sat on the couch wit ha look of horror and betrayal.\n\n“IHe said the warning bite wasn’t that bad” Dark Brandon said in tears.\n\nSlow Brandon cried hysterically.\n\nWe all went home after that, and everyone with the bite had trouble sleeping that night. It was weird.\n\nBut it didn’t seem to really mess us up that much and we all went on with our lives.\n\nA few years later on a weekend morning I was back over at Brandon's place. We were smoking weed, surfing Amazon prime for stuff to watch.\n\n“The rebuild of Evangelion is done guys. Want to watch it?” Dark Brandon said.\n\n“Fuck it. These are real movies not mind fuck they can’t be cursed!” Slow Brandon said.\n\nWe watched Eva 1 first. This was one we had all seen before. It was an old favourite and we often watched it instead of the first 7 episodes of the show.\n\nAfter it was done we put on Eva 2. I hadn’t seen this one before but both the Brandon’s had.\n\n“I like how they made the ocean red” Slow Brandon said.\n\nAfter watching it for a while I realised that this shit wasn’t evangelion. This was weird pornography spliced with all the usual images. The fighting had no stakes. I felt as if I was being taken away on a dream voyage.\n\nWhen it was done we put on Eva 3 you can NOT redo\n\nWe started watching it and I was appalled. The timeskips, Asuka still looked the same. Nothing was explained and Shinji had this necklace on his head that could blow at any time.\n\nAfter the first half of the movie was done Kwaru came on screen. He proceeded to eat our minds for the next 40 or so minutes. At the end of it all he said “Shinji these aren't the lances we need”\n\nAt that point I realised all the exposition he had spotted for 40 minutes was all absolute nonsense. I almost didn’t want to watch the last one.\n\n“Which one of you watched that travesty and said it was good?” I said angrily.\n\n“Well we both watched it, but we didn’t finish it. I thought Kwaru was going to make sense.” Dark Brandon said in a haze.\n\nThen I realised it. Asuka had mentioned the curse of evangelion in the movie.\n\n“Guys I don’t think we should watch the last one. This is freaking me out way too much.” I said in disbelief.\n\nSlow Branon laughed maniacally. \n\n“I didn’t realise it till after I watched the 4th one” Slow Brandon sneered.\n\n“What?” Me and Dark Brandon said in unison.\n\nSlow Brandon pulled out a handgun and laughed.\n\n“I made a deal with the plug suit Eva! We are all going to watch it and instead of biting me He’ll bite both of you!” Slow Brandon laughed.\n\nHe shot at the ground and took our phones. We sat on the couch with gun pointed at us.\n\nThankfully slow Branon seemed more interested in the movie than we were and we averted our eyes and hummed to ourselves while he watched.\n\nEven though I was trying not to watch it I noted that the plug suit Eva was not even in the movie. This truly was the ultimate betrayal in the form of entertainment.\n\nSuddenly the screen froze on the plug suit Eva again.\n\nSuddenly we heard a loud terrifying voice that almost made my heart stop.\n\n“The thing is you have to watch 2, 3 and 4 all twice to get a bite at all. But they stack.”\n\nThen a TV appeared clear as day in front of Slow Brandon. The Eva sat there looking at him as perfectly clear versions of everyone he knew stood there clapping. They all had the plug suit Eva on their faces.\n\n“Congratulations on getting the worst possible ending!” They all yelled gayly.\n\nThe plug suit Eva chomped down on Slow Brandon’s chest and he screamed with more pain then Shinji or Asuka in the end of evangelion.\n\nThen the TV disappeared. Slow Brandon sat there screaming for a few seconds then ran out the door.\n\nHe apparently made it almost 40 miles running on foot before his heart gave out.\n\nI’m posting this as the sternest warning ever to not watch the rebuild of Evangelion or Death and rebirth if you have ever even seen the end of evangelion and the last 2 episodes of the show. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",

        "text": "It's located in the basement, at the end of a hall, it is always locked. None of the keys in any department can unlock it. When it does get opened, it has to be documented in a book. Officially, it's only been opened twice. Once, when the graveyard housekeeper saw it flying off the hinges, slamming open and shut. Maintence chalked it up to a wiring issue with the wheelchair button. Everyone knows that a closet in the basement has never had a wheelchair button. Twice, when maintenance removed the door from the hinges so the fire department could check the sprinklers. When they arrived, the door was back on the frame locked up tight. They never did check those sprinklers. \n\n\nSince then, many rumors, theories, and stories have come out of that closet. Just about everyone in housekeeping, kitchen, and maintenance, as well as some doctors and nurses, even a few patients, have had encounters with this closet. My first encounter happened last night.  \n\n\nI was working an evening shift, doing my regular routine, taking out the garbage, and recycling. I've done this shift a lot, so I was familiar with the hall and the closet that lived at the end of it. It never did anything strange with me, and I always thought the stories were just that. That was until I saw the door handle jiggle. I shook my head, confused. It was an ordinary closet; the handle couldn't jiggle. But it did, this time more aggressively. The whole door started to shake in its frame while I stood there frozen. Nothing like this should be happening. Someone must be trapped inside. I reached out and grabbed the handle. The door fell silent. \n\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I whispered and pulled the handle down. Locked. I shook my head again, trying to make any sense of this situation. \"Maybe it was the wires.\" I said to myself. I continued with my work duties, but I couldn't shake what I saw with that door. I dumped the last bit of cardboard and headed back inside.\n\n\nI passed the door, it was wide open. All of a sudden, from up the hall, I heard the frantic slam of footsteps rushing and the squeeking and buckling of trolley wheels. Two nurses whipped around the corner, pushing a trauma victim full speed towards me. I leaped out the way, narrowly dodging the gurney. It was like I was invisible to the nurses. They made no gestures or calls for me to move. I picked myself up and looked back. They pulled the stretcher into the closet and closed the door behind them. I put my hand on the handle, butterflies danced in my stomach, and the hairs stood on my neck. I pressed down, and the handled started to move. The door was unlocked. I flung open the door, expecting to see organs being harvested or cannibalism.\nI saw nothing but an empty closet. Not even a shelf in this bare room. No sign a stretcher was even in this room. I closed the door.\n\"Whoops, left the lights on.\" I squeezed the handle again. Locked. \n\n\nI couldn't believe what just happened to me, but protocol says I have to document it. I opened the basement binder and flipped to the very back where we kept the encounter sheet specifically for the door. I wrote the date and time it happened, followed by my signature. There should have been only three encounter dates, but there was a fourth. The encounter is dated a week from today. No one has signed it.",

        "text": "I live in a one-bedroom condominium in a very upscale neighborhood of a large city. It’s right next to the university that I attend as a graduate student, but it’s too expensive for most of the undergrads, so instead the building is mostly filled with old retirees who’ve been living in the area for decades. It’s quiet and comfy, a perfect fit. I don’t even bother locking my door most of the time. That’s how safe I’ve felt living there.... until last week.\n\nThe front desk at the condo building requires a concierge at all times, and when the pandemic hit, they quickly became short-staffed. I happily agreed to fill the position on weekends—since I lived on the third floor anyways, it was a great opportunity to make some easy money while helping people out during a hard time. It was a low-stress job that consisted of little more than fetching people’s packages for them every now and then, and in the meantime, I could spend most of the eight hour shifts studying, reading, or just browsing on my phone or laptop. \n\nI was near the end of last Saturday’s shift when the building’s power abruptly died. All the lights switched off with a sudden click that made me jump. Only the glow of my laptop screen kept me from total darkness, providing a single island of light in the sea of darkness that now engulfed me. The manager had warned me this might happen and prepared me accordingly, explaining that the old building’s wiring was on the fritz and that it could usually be fixed by just resetting the breaker. \n\nOf course, the breaker was located in the sub-basement. I figured I better go ahead and try to get it done before any of the old-timers started calling the desk and asking when the power would be back. So, I stood up, retrieved the building’s master key ring from a box on the wall, turned on my phone’s flashlight, and got moving. As I made my way down the empty hallway towards the stairs, the light of my laptop faded out of view behind me, making me feel like some kind of explorer venturing out into a new world.\n\nMy footsteps echoed loudly through the stairwell as I made my way down several flights, well underground by the time I reached the double-doors at the very bottom. A large sign on the doors read “SUB-BASEMENT – STAFF ONLY.” I set my phone down on the floor, using the column of light it provided to fumble through the dozens of keys available to me, suddenly starting to worry that I wouldn’t remember which one was the sub-basement. Luckily, it was marked with a small label. The metal doors groaned as I pushed them apart, the noise combining with the utter darkness beyond to give me the impression of a subterranean behemoth whose maw I was about to enter.\n\nThe sub-basement consisted of a wide hallway with a few metal doors on either side, leading to miscellaneous rooms for one purpose or another. One stood ajar to reveal an ancient bathroom that no longer functioned, and I knew a couple more led to storage closets. I shuffled past them quickly, making my way to the large open space that the hall opened into. In here the maintenance staff kept plenty of the larger equipment, in addition to a lot of random junk that had accumulated over the course of decades. I navigated through the assortment of tables and machinery, making my way to a back corner where one last door waited. This one opened to another small room, slightly bigger than a closet, and it contained my target on the back wall—the distinctive switches of the building’s circuit breakers.\n\nAs soon as I stepped into the room, my phone died, leaving me helpless in the quiet dark. I fumbled with the treacherous hunk of plastic and glass to no avail. It was just as dead as the rest of the building. I knew it was charged, because I always left it plugged in while I was sitting at the front desk. Stupid thing… at least it waited until my goal was right here, I thought.\n\nPutting my phone into my pocket so I could use both hands, I found the small room’s door frame, then felt my way along the wall, looking for the panel that would deliver me from this darkness. It wasn’t hard to find and soon I had the master breaker switch in my grasp. Breathing a sigh of relief, I pulled it aside, then back to its previous position. Light returned to the world and then some; my vision was blinded by a burst of pure white, causing me to cry out in surprise and stumble back against the wall. \n\nIt took a few moments for me to recover from the shock of the flash, the spots slowly receding out of my eyes. Was that some kind of power surge or something? I was studying philosophy, not electrical engineering, so I had no idea. I was getting ready to just write it off and finish my shift when I realized one other thing that was wrong, one which I definitely could not just write off. \n\nAs I looked around me, I understood that I was now standing on the ceiling. \n\nMy first reaction was to drop to the floor in panic, terrified that I would instantly fall and bash my head. Except the floor was now the ceiling so I found myself eye level with the lightbulb illuminating the room. The mismatch between my sight and the pull of gravity sent a wave of vertigo through me and I thought I might puke. Would the puke go up or down? What the hell was going on?! I squeezed my eyes shut and laid still on the floor-ceiling until I felt the nausea receding.\n\nOkay. I’m going to open my eyes and this will just be a dream, I thought. Hopefully no one would notice that I nodded off on the job. Of course, when I opened my eyes I still found myself looking at a lightbulb across from me, and the concrete floor of the sub-basement was still below—or above?—me. Whatever this was, it was real. I was laying on the ceiling, gravity apparently having reversed itself somehow.\n\nI expected to have some difficulty getting back to my feet, but it felt just as natural as back when gravity went the right way down. My body couldn’t feel any difference, it was my mind that was confused, knowing that this was not the way that things were supposed to be. One thing I immediately noticed was that the reversal seemed to include my clothes. That was a relief, this was weird enough already without having my shirt constantly falling down into my face. That raised the question of whether it applied to everything else in the building too.\n\nA quick glance back into the main area of the sub-basement showed that it did not. All the miscellaneous tools and junk stayed down on the ground where it belonged. It felt surreal walking across the space’s ceiling with the top of my head nearly scraping some of the stuff on the tables. I reached down and picked up a wrench to see what would happen. It weighed the same but gravity definitely still pulled it towards the floor; when I let go it dropped back down to its table with a loud, echoing clang.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, I made my way back out of the sub-basement and up the stairwell, walking quite comfortably along ceilings the whole way. When I got back to the first floor I decided to try hopping off the edge where the ceiling stopped at the landing, and fell up to the next ceiling above the door to the first floor. No problem, just like riding a bike again, I thought.\n\nBut I hadn’t thought this through, because now I was standing above the door I needed to go through and the doorknob was out of reach below me. Even standing on tiptoes, it was barely too far away. Luckily I was able to jump down just far enough to wrap my hand around it, leaving me hanging onto the knob while the reverse-gravity tried to pull me back up to the ceiling. I planted my feet along the top of the doorframe, turned the knob, and managed to pull the door open before letting go and landing back on the ceiling a few inches above.\n\nFrom there it was easy enough to step through, just a big step over the top part of the door frame, but I made a note to be more careful next time I needed to change floors. The lobby appeared exactly as I left it. When I walked over to the front desk and looked down at my laptop’s screen, I could see that it was still open to the Instagram page I’d been browsing when the power went out. I was trying to figure out how I would reach it when I heard a noise behind me. It was the familiar sound of the building’s automated front doors opening.\n\nI turned around, eager to see another human being who might be able to help me, but there was no one there. I stared for a moment at the sunlight pouring in through the open doors, then flinched and turned away as another wave of vertigo ran through me. The implication had just hit me. What would happen if I stepped out of those doors? If I went outside—where there was no ceiling? The feel of a light breeze at my back was too much and I ran for it, sprinting desperately back to the stairs. I didn’t know where I was going, I just had to get away from that gateway to oblivion.\n\nIn my panic, I had no time to think about how I could possibly manage going back down to the basement levels, so instead I just ran up, up, along the ceilings of the stairwell, making it up several stories before I finally stopped to breathe. It occurred to me that going back down to the lower floors, now that I’d passed above them, would actually be very difficult from in here. I might be able to pull myself down along the handrails, but that wasn’t a very appealing thought. The elevator would be a lot easier. Besides, I needed to see if I could talk to someone else in the building and figure out what was going on.\n\nThe door to the fourth-floor hallway was near to where I’d stopped, so I hopped down and grabbed the doorknob, repeating the technique I’d learned on the first floor to open it and step through. I stepped carefully over light fixtures as I made my way down the long hallway, feeling their heat on my ankles. There was no one in sight. I thought about calling out for help when I heard a door open behind me. Turning around, I saw one of the building’s elderly residents standing in her doorway, staring silently at me.\n\nHer face was set in stone, bearing no expression, but somehow her eyes conveyed a sense of malice, a deep hatred. I got the profound sense of trespassing somewhere that I shouldn’t have. All around me, the doors of the hallway began to open, the residents pouring out into the hall. None of them said a word. All carried that same face, devoid of emotion, and focused like a laser on me. I decided, far too late, to try and get the hell out of there. I barely made it three steps before an old man reached up and grabbed me by the hair.\n\nI screamed in pain as he pulled me down off the ceiling, his grip like iron. More wrinkled hands took hold all over my body as the residents crowded in around me with a singular purpose. I beat and kicked desperately, feeling my blows land against flesh, but it didn’t seem to make any difference. None of them so much as flinched. My screams and flails turned to desperate pleas, begging them to let me go, not to hurt me.\n\nThen I realized that they weren’t actually hurting me. I was now held by so many pairs of vise-like hands that I could barely move at all, but other than the intense pressure of their grip, they didn’t harm me. The light fixtures on the ceiling passed by overhead as I came to realize that they were carrying me down the hall. I only had a moment to wonder where we were going before a familiar sound answered that question for me: The chime of the elevator arriving.\n\n“Where are you taking me?” I asked them, my voice weak and trembling.\n\nNothing. The few whose faces I could see no longer looked at me, instead looking straight ahead as they crowded into the elevator, still holding my body between them all. I made a few more pathetic, useless attempts to resist before accepting my fate… whatever it was going to be. I could still feel the reverse-gravity pulling me up towards the roof of the elevator, although the firm grips of the residents held it easily at bay, for now. The elevator dinged for each floor that it went up… one… two… three… four. The building only had eight floors. That meant they had taken me to the top floor, and now they were carrying me out of the elevator.\n\nI heard more doors opening around us as the small crowd carried me down the eighth-floor hallway, many of them banging loudly. Suddenly overcome with anxiety, I tried asking again where they were taking me. I didn’t know what was going on, but I knew that I was in danger, that I needed to fight or take flight. Yet I could do neither, powerless as I was dragged into the stairwell. As soon as we started going up the stairs, I realized what was going to happen. I screamed, I begged, I strained and struggled frantically, my stomach rising into my throat and tears pouring down my face.\n\nThen the door to the roof opened. They threw me out and I was falling. Falling up into the sky, into the endless abyss, my world shifted instantly into nothing but an empty blue in all directions. I screamed in horror, but I couldn’t hear my own voice. All I heard was the deafening roar of the wind all around me. My stomach flipped over and over, my head swam, and still I continued falling. There was no earth to catch me. The only mercy was that I finally lost consciousness.\n\nI woke up in a hospital bed with both my legs shattered beyond repair. The doctors were very careful around me, too careful, guarded with their words. Still, by listening when they thought I was asleep, I was able to learn how they found me. I’d been found on the roof of my condo building in this state, as if I’d been dropped there from an extreme height. I heard the phrase “lucky to be alive” more than once. I don’t know if I agree.\n\nAt least gravity works properly again. I guess I finally fell out of that upside-down world and back into my own. I’ll never walk again, but I think I might prefer it that way. The wheelchair gives me comfort. It’s an anchor to the earth, something to grip and to hold on to. The condo building’s manager told me to take as much time off as I needed, but I begged for the concierge job back, as soon as possible. I don’t like being under the open sky anymore, so having a job where I don’t have to leave my building is very important to me now. Thank goodness for the pandemic normalizing work-from-home; that’s going to keep my career options open.\n\nI also asked the manager about that power outage, the one that took me to that other place. That was maybe the strangest thing of all. According to him, there had never been a power outage. The power hadn’t gone out like that in months. He said I hadn’t even been scheduled to work that day. It was the person who *was* working the front desk that day who called 911 after they noticed my body on the roof’s security cam. So as I sit here at the front desk, I wonder what I would do if it ever happened again. It would be a lot harder to reach the breakers in this chair, and even if I could, would I dare to flip that switch again?\n\nI think I might need to start looking for a new place to live.",

        "text": "Driving 15 hours straight is a pain in the ass. Sure, you have Audible, music, and the radio to listen to, but driving for a long time is still tiresome, and I've only stopped to get fuel, relieve myself, and eat and drink. My body is now reaching its limits, and I still have ten more hours.  \n\nI've found a reasonably priced hotel and what makes it better is that there is a Waffle House down the road. I decided to stop and fill my empty stomach and empty my bladder. \n\nI pulled into the nearly empty parking lot as it was around three in the morning and chilly here in the south. I got out of my car, locked it, and looked at the never-closing restaurant; rain, sleet, hail, snow, or even if the apocalypse is happening, Waffle House is here to serve you. I waved to two of the smoking workers, and they just looked at me and waved back. \n\nI opened the door and was greeted by the small night crew there. I took a seat at the bar, and a woman whose name tag read Sandy came up to me and asked, \" What kind of drink will you be having, huh,\" her southern accent drew out the last syllables of each word.\n\n\"I'll be having some water with ice, and I know what I'll be having,\" I replied. \n\n\"Ok, \" Sandy said as she pulled out her receipt booklet and popped her pen.\n\n\"I'll have a Texas bacon patty melt, hold the onions and pickles, and a side order of grits,\" I said while rubbing my eyes.\n\n\"Ok, it'll be done in a few, \" Sandy said, finishing the order and then calling out to the cooks, and they repeated the order. \n\nSandy left and returned with a cup of water, and I snatched it as soon as she sat it down. I downed that water and signed in relief. Sandy smiled at me and said, \" Well, where are you from?\" \n\n\"I'm just passing through. I drove fifteen hours and had ten more left. I just needed something to eat before I hit the hay.\" \n\n\"Oh, ok, business or pleasure?\" \n\n\"Vacation. I should have booked a flight instead of driving, this was a bad idea, but no one ever tells you how boring and a pain in the ass it is. Just sitting in one spot and shifting every so often, though the sights are nice, and it's lovely to see how fast the scenery changes from city to trees within no time.\"\n\n\"Yea must be lovely,\" Sandy's said, \" I got to get back to work.\" She said, reaching for my half-empty drink to refill it.  \n\nShe returned, and then I got up, \" I need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.\"\n\n\"I'll be here waiting for ya.\" She said, smiling and waving at me.\n\nI walked down the hallway, and there were three doors: one was a men's and one women's restroom, and the other door was left cracked open, probably a supply closet someone forgot to close.\n\nThe relief from emptying my bladder felt almost as good as the cold water. I washed up and headed back, but that was when I heard a moan from the cracked door. It was low and far away.\n\nI gave the door a side-eye. I'm not opening the door and seeing whoever is there having sex. It's the last image I want to see before I sleep. I stepped away, and that's when another moan came out, but it wasn't out of pleasure but of pain. \n\n\"Dylan,\" I said to myself. \"this is none of your business. Just eat and leave. Eat and leave.\" Another moan came out, more raspy and dry.\n\nI opened the door, and I was confused. What I thought was a closet was a door leading to a basement. When the hell did a Waffle House, have a basement? I looked down the steps, and the darkness made it impossible to see how deep it went. \n\nAnother Moan came out.\n\n\"Son of a bitch, don't do this. This is every horror story and movie begins. Don't be the stereotypical white dude and invest--.\"\n\nI looked down the hallway back to the dining floor, and no one was looking. I opened the door and went down. God damnit. What if someone is being held down there, and the people here aren't as they seem? You know that Waffle House hires felons, and someone is still doing their thing. A basement is the best place to hide a body. No one would check a Waffle House because Waffle Houses have no basements except this one. \n\nI got my phone from my pocket, turned on my flashlight, and saw that the stairs had gone deep. Deeper than a basement should be. I started down the steps, and more moans of pain came out; these moans sounded like how zombies in the movies do. It took at least three minutes to get down the stairs making a spiral pattern and going down. Meanwhile, the moaning kept getting more precise and louder. \n\nI finally made it to the floor level and what I saw was just… mind-blowing. This wasn't a basement; the thing in front of me looked like a massive cathedral and would make any church blush. I don't know how the foundation hasn't collapsed or caved in. Sure there are pillars for support, but wouldn't that even have its limits or begin a skink hole with this much mass missing to support the building?\n\nThere looked to be roots growing in and out, and these roots covered the entire ceiling and hung like vines from trees. The moan came again, and I found where the noise was coming from, and I ran where a mass of thick roots came down, looking like a Redwood tree with those roots expanding in every direction.\n\nWhat I thought was roots was something entirely different. I didn't know what to make of it. I rushed to the other side, and what I saw terrified me. A man was trapped in those roots, the roots piercing in and out of his body. They also came out from his mouth, and a single root came from the top of his head. \n\nThis man looked like he hadn't eaten or drunk in years, and he looked nearly one hundred with how old and saggy his skin looked. His pupils were white and glazed over, and that's when he moaned. I don't fault the guy; he seems to be in pain. His vocal cords were on their last legs and could only make wheezing, or whatever you call wheezing, sounds.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, I was struck on my head and grunted in pain. My phone fell out of my hands, and I staggered and reached for my head. I looked behind me, and my vision blurred, and a familiar voice came through, \" Well, shucks, hun, you shouldn't be here,\" Sandy struck me several more times before I blacked out. \n\nI woke up in darkness with an enormous headache. I felt my body tied up and couldn't move an inch. The man was nowhere to be found. A tiny tremble and dim blue lights lit up the room, and I saw I was wrapped in the roots. I panicked and started to shout, and that's when the roots began to move, and it then released me.\n\nI stumbled, and that made my headache even worse. The roots then grabbed my legs, lifted me into the air, and took hold of my arms, and then pain in my back, no, my spin erupted as I've never met before. It was as though the roots were hooking into my spin. Other roots then shot into my arms and body, and I screamed like a newborn baby, and I nearly passed out. The roots wrapped around me like a chain spool then more roots made their way to my mouth, but I was too damn tired to fight and screamed. \n\nThe roots going down my throat caused my gag reflex to respond, but I had nothing to upchuck, so it was just dry heaving and tears stained my eyes. There came another shock of pain at the base of my skull; this made my entire body convulse and stretch out, become ridged, and go limp a second later. I was crying and breathing heavily. I looked down and saw the blood dripping and pooling.\n\n My adrenaline was now wearing off, the pain was becoming unbearable, and fatigue began to set in, but I couldn't pass out. I looked around my new jail cell, and I looked up and saw another root lowering down; this one was different, it was large and sharp, and it was lowering to my head. I tried moving but was too damn tired to move, and the roots held me in place. \n\nThe needle-like root lowered and pierced my skull. It sounded horrible; there was a pain, but just for a split second, I couldn't scream, and then I was one.\n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nWaffle House isn't what it seems.\n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nWaffle House isn't a restaurant.\n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nIt's something different; it's a living organism.\n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nIt has its roots throughout the southern states, and it is spreading. \n\nThe Waffle House has found its new host.\n\nIt is hungry.

According to her, I was supposed to be exactly like her, and it was all my fault if I wasn’t up to par.  My mother was beautiful, slender, and was a rich, famous model.\n\nMe on the other hand, I lost the genetic lottery.  I would always gain massive amounts of weight for no reason.\n\nNothing could control my endless weight gain.  \n\nI tried keto dieting, fasting, exercising until my muscles were going to explode, everything including the kitchen sink.  There was even a time where I tried ingesting tape worms to suck the cellulite out of my body.\n\nEscaping wasn’t going to work.  All of the staff were too scared of her to disobey and ensured I would stay permanently according to her wishes.  The last thing all of us wanted to do was piss her off.  Fighting back wasn’t going to work, either.  Whenever I called the police, they would just dismiss my claims, leading to more abuse.\n\nI just wanted it all to stop.  The only way I could stop this was to please her.\n\nBut I couldn’t.\n\n\\---\n\nI had forgotten how many days passed since my mom last fed me.  Even when she would provide me with meals, they were portioned so small that they couldn’t even feed an ant.\n\nI had walked home from high school, last Tuesday, where my mother was waiting right at the door.  Her arms were folded and she was giving me a death glare that burned through me.  She handed me a jar of vomit inducing syrup.\n\n“Drink.” My mother demanded, shutting the door behind me.\n\nI took the opaque jar from her hand, letting its cool surface touch my lips.  Its taste frazzled and bit at my tongue, coating it in a film of pain.  I spit it back in.\n\n“I can’t...” I said, meekly.  She rose her hand and struck me in the face.\n\n“I’m YOUR MOTHER!  Do as you are told!  Drink, now!”\n\nMy stomach quaked and roared.  All I had to eat that day was cafeteria food so appalling that prisoners wouldn’t even give it a sniff.  \n\nBut I had to keep sustenance in me.  I couldn’t possibly last much longer if I didn’t eat.\n\n“Drink!” She screamed.\n\nSeeing I had no other options, I started chug the bottle.  I gagged, wanting to spit out the concoction as bad as I wanted to breath.  \n\nMy hand slipped on the edge of the bottle, suddenly.  It fell to the floor with a crack, spilling out the contents.\n\nI pressed my back against the door, covering my head with my arms and bracing myself for what was going to come.\n\n“You did that on purpose, didn’t you?!”  My mother roared.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, I couldn’t find any words to say and defend myself.  “M-mom! No, I-it was an-” she grabbed me by my hair, throwing me to the floor like a sandbag.  Before I could get up, she stomped on me and kicked at my ribs.  I crouched on the ground, arms around my chest, begging her to stop.  Her stiletto dug into my back, not unlike an archeologist’s pickaxe around a dinosaur bone.  \n\n“Look at me!” She yanked up my snot and tear covered face, spraying saliva as she snarled.  “I gave birth to you!  Who fed you and took care of you every day ever since you were born?  Me.  And now you are going to pay back!  You are not going to be an embarrassment to my career!  I worked my fingers to the bone and I expect you to obey.  Do you understand?”\n\n“Yes! Yes! Just stop, please!”\n\nShe slammed me down when she had enough with me.  “And wipe the gunk off your face.”\n\nI ran upstairs and shut the bathroom door in a rage.  My hands turned red while I clenched the porcelain sink.  The blood and heat from my body congealed into my face.  Cold water cleansed my skin and made it turn back into its natural shade of apricot.  Rolls of fat from jostled around, their sound resembling taunting.  I bit my lip until blood was drawn.\n\n“Worthless piece of shit!” I choked on my tears.\n\nI would not deal with this mistreatment.  Fighting her was a no-go as I said before; she was thousands of times stronger than me.  Taking on her would be like a baby trying to take on Bruce Lee.\n\nIf I didn’t lose weight, this torture will only continue.  What was I going to do?\n\nI ran into my room, shutting the door.  Cracking my cheap laptop open (my mom refused to give me anything useful unless I “behaved,”) I scrambled through the webpages, tears clouding my vision.\n\nEvery time I moved on to the next link, it would remain stuck for several minutes.  I shouldn’t have been surprised; my laptop was slower than a tortoise on ketamine. Each refresh would only bring up countless clicked web links.  \n\nSo many failed attempts at trying to lose weight.  \n\nI pounded a fist against the bed sheet.  Hours passed.  \n\nThere was no solution in sight.  \n\nAfter time flew by like an arrow, I finally found an unclicked link.  A black website pulled up with the words “Looking to lose weight?  Try spirit therapy!”  \n\nThere was still hope I could please my mother.  My tears dried.  A laugh bubbled up in me, but I shut my trap before I could alert anyone.  \n\nIn red, there was a list of instructions.\n\n*STEP ONE: DRAW BLOOD FROM YOUR INDEX FINGER.*\n\nMy mom wouldn’t allow me to keep any knives in case I ever got any “ideas,” so I took out a nail clipper, pressed the razor jaws against the swirl on my index finger, bit down on my pillow, and snipped off a chunk of skin.  The metallic liquid covered the print in crimson.\n\n*STEP 2: RUB THE BLOOD AGAINST YOUR HANDS AND KEEP THEM TOGETHER IN A PRAYER.*\n\nI smeared the wound across the palms of my hands.  Liquid started to coagulate and turn into an almost gluey substance.  I put them in prayer, clicking my tongue in satisfaction.\n\n*STEP 3: KEEPING YOUR HANDS TOGETHER, SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS:* \n\n*Like the moon will eternally wax and wane,*\n\n*I have been forced to live a life in unheeding pain,*\n\n*Spirits from beyond the crimson veil,*\n\n*Whose mission it is to help those who fail,*\n\n*I summon you all and ask for a hand,*\n\n*End my suffering at once as that is my command.*\n\nAfter saying those words, I closed my eyes and let the magic do its work.  When I reopened them, nothing had happened.  I broke down in tears once again.  My nightmare was going to continue.\n\n*POUND, POUND, POUND!*  “Get going, Nora!  Meet me in the bathroom so I can fix you up!  I have a photo shoot in a private park at 7:00!”  It was my mother.\n\n“Coming!” I wiped the tears away and rolled my eyes at the door.  If I was caught crying in front of all those people, I was guaranteed a punishment.  \n\nI got up, a blur shooting past the outside of my window.  It left a motion trail where it had passed.  I rubbed the tears out of my eyes.  The flash was gone.  The only thing that could match the blur’s color was the sunset.\n\n\\---\n\nTwilight shined through the autumn forest.  A snow white drape covered the golden leaves.  Dozens of magazine photographers stood around her in a semi-circle.\n\nI wore a slender ruby dress covered in glittering sequins while my mother wore a dress beautiful gold skirt with a dandelion yellow corset and sashes to match.  Flashes of cameras blinded me.  With each flash, she would strike pose after pose.\n\n“This is how you are supposed to model, Nora!  Watch and learn!” She said, smiling at me and waving to the photographers.\n\nIt took everything I had for me to not punch her in the teeth.\n\nI walked away, hoping to release some steam.  There was no way I was going to be anywhere near that two-faced whore any longer.  I took off my high heels and let my feet flatten against the ground.\n\n*Rustle, rustle…*\n\nBetween the chatter far away, the leaves started to crunch while I was standing still.  I turned back to the crowd, hoping my mother was not looking for me.  I ran off until the crowd was not visible.\n\n*Scratch, scratch, scratch…*\n\nI did a double take at the canopies.  The sun was on the fringe of the horizon and darkness was starting to surround the park.\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, a clump of bones, muscle and hair landed with a wet thud against the ground.  Its crimson form crumpled to the dry earth like an oversized raindrop.  \n\nThen came another falling from the sky.  \n\nThen another and another until half a dozen shriveled and bony figures peered at me.  Their sockets were empty with nerves hanging while their eyelids were permanently stitched open.  All their mouths were covered in sores.  Ribs poked out from their chests that cracked and rattled, similar to the bars on a broken xylophone, as they paced forward.\n\nMy muscles locked in place.  I turned to the photographers.  Making a blind move, I sprinted towards them.  I didn’t care about what my mother would do to me for my ignorance. \n\nThe only thing I wanted was safety.\n\n“Somebody help-!” stone cold fingers clamped my jaw shut.  Hands ripped apart my dress, pressing my back against the dead grass.  Like a pack of wolves bringing down an elk, they climbed all over me, covering my mouth to prevent me from crying out.\n\nOnce they had immobilized me, their lipless mouths opened into a white void.  The sound of deep inhaling whistled through my bones, passing through my cells not unlike a river passing through rapids.  \n\nMy breath was eaten away, slowly being erased from this world.  They opened their mouths further and further, trying to absorb everything from the atmosphere.  Their jangly heads creaked with each inch closer they drew.\n\nI closed my eyes, hoping it would all be over.\n\nTo my surprise, the figures had left.  By the time I spun around to investigate, they already took off into the night.  My arms and legs were covered in thin purple bruises where those bastards had pinned me.  Activity from the photographers had vanished and the rest of the camera crew, too.\n\n“Nora!” My mother exclaimed, observing those that might be watching.\n\nCovering my middle finger with my other hand, I frowned.  She immediately embraced me in a hug.  \n\nI was not going to accept anything from her.  It was always just another lie.\n\nShe then hissed into my ear.  “We will deal with your actions when we get home, missy!”  My mother looked around once more.  “I’m so glad you’re safe.”  \n\nI silently groaned.\n\nShe ran her fingers across my waist, taken aback suddenly.  Her mouth was agape.  “Nora…My god…Look at your body!  You’re beautiful!”\n\nMy eyes turned down at my form.  The rolls of fat were flattened.  I felt my face.  The contours were in tune and no longer flabby.  My limbs were slender as twigs.\n\nI began to giggle at my new form.  The treatment worked!  After every second, that laugh grew heartier and louder.\n\n“Come on, sweetie.  Let me make you some soup when we get home.”  I gave her a nervous smile, trying to scout for any strings she might have attached to her proposal.  Even if she did live up to her promise, what was I supposed to do?  Was it going to be a trick?\n\n\\---\n\n*FIVE DAYS LATER*\n\nFor once in my life, my abuse was going to end…\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nMy mother proceeded to smack me with a ruler.  “You’re a fucking slut!” She barked.\n\n“All you ever do is stand in my way!  Why don’t you ever obey the simplest orders?!”\n\nAfter countless hours of abuse, she sent me up to my room for bed.\n\nI didn’t understand.  \n\nFor once, I was able to give her what she wanted after years of being unable to please her.  Yet, now the abuse remained.  What was I going to do now?\n\nAs I retreated to my quarters, I tucked myself in and closed my eyes.  The pillow turned moist from the tears falling from my eyes.\n\nThe lights were shut off automatically some hours later.  I could occasionally hear the footsteps of the passing guards, but drifted off without minding them.\n\n*Creeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaak…*\n\nI awoke, jutting up from the covers to investigate the noise.  The window was ajar.  \n\n“Didn’t I lock it before I went to bed?” I said to myself.  I quickly closed it and gazed outside.  Lights from the lamp posts illuminated the streets.  Outside from some yapping coyotes or stray cats, the night was still.\n\nI blinked, lazily shutting the window and shades before crawling back in bed.  \n\nMy eyes were closed not for fifteen seconds when a depression developed on my bed.  Arising once again, I woke up, only to see the six rusty figures from five days ago at the park.  \n\nTheir mouths open and slobbering.  One of them was already nose to nose with me.  Their cold fingers wrapped around me as they all forced my mouth shut once again and opened their mouths to deeply inhale the air.  As a shroud of grey mist entered their mouths, I passed out.\n\n\\---\n\nMy fingers rested in between a ribcage of some sort when I woke up.  Were those bastards back for more?  I yanked off the covers, hyperventilating.\n\n“No.  It couldn’t be…” I whispered.  My skin was shrink-wrapped around my frail frame.  I touched my head, feeling the notches on my skull.  My hair was left in clumps, my scalp resembling a worn out porcelain doll.\n\nI ran over to the wall mirror, screaming in horror.\n\nMy beautiful form was gone.  All the muscle in my body had vanished, leaving me with nothing but a starved skeleton.  I sliced off some skin with the nail clipper, putting the blood on a glucose monitor.\n\nMy sugar levels were normal.  Those creatures were responsible for leaving me like this.  Doctors wouldn’t be able to solve my condition; I had to talk to a professional that knew about the demons that stalked me.\n\nI typed in the location of the nearest psychic, clambering out the window and sneaking away from the cameras towards the city.  In times like those, I wish I were allowed to drive.  When I was a far enough distance away, I paused.  \n\nShould I try and call the police?  I decided not to even bother.  My mother would just fabricate another lie to get them to buzz off and I would just be abused again.  The fact that the staff at the house were on my mother’s side did not help.  Besides, it wouldn’t help my situation with the demons.  I was certain that if I didn’t get everything figured out, the specters would kill me.\n\nBefore I continued further, I scanned my surroundings in case they would show up.  When they didn’t, I continued my search.\n\n\\---\n\nI brushed aside the bead screen entrance, leading to a gold leaf coated room filled with exotic fabrics, cushions, and black curtains.  Surrounded by an igloo of pillows was an old woman in a hood with the symbols of the Greek Zodiac tattooed on her face.\n\n“What brings you here?” The psychic inhaled a puff of smoke from her pipe and blew a ring at me.  I waved it away. \n\n“You know about the supernatural, right?  I’ve been stalked by these…I don’t know…scraggly, crimson…things.  Please help me!  I’m beginning to waste away!”  I turned towards the bead screen.  If I stared outside long enough, I could see their crimson shapes lurking outside and waiting to strike.  “Are you going to read my palm or look at a crystal ball or stuff like that?”\n\nThe woman just stared at me.  “Very funny.  Take a deep breath.”\n\nI did as I was told.  A smooth rectangle formed from her smoke, bending around my face.  Ink from her zodiac symbols dripped off and tapped my forehead.  Then, the smoke cleared.\n\n“Why the hell would you summon demons like that?!  Everyone knows demons hate humans!  There better be a good explanation!” She said, leaning in and taking off her hood.  Long silver hair draped from her scalp.  She was shocked, but her narrow eyes indicated that she wanted to hear more of my story.\n\n“You see, I was trying to lose weight, but I couldn’t figure out any reason why.  I had to do what I could!  It worked for a while but now it ended up like-“\n\n“Say no more.  I have an explanation.  You actually don’t have any physical conditions that led you to gaining this much weight.”\n\nI rested my heart on my chest.  “Good to know.”\n\n“It’s spiritual.  You see, humans sometimes have souls that are way too big and have to shed away access material.  Sometimes it comes up as nosebleeds, extra dandruff, and in your case, fat.  The demons helped stabilize your condition, so you won’t have to worry about weight gain again.  The bad news is those demons you summoned are not trying to help you,” she explained.\n\n“Then what were they trying to do?”\n\nThe seer gave me a cold stare.  “Look for a meal.  They feed off of human souls.  Sounds like you were tricked by the website owner.”\n\nI gasped. “Is there any way that I can stop them?”\n\n“I wouldn’t say stop them.  More like repel them.  You must consume human flesh to ward them off.”\n\nMy blood dropped to my feet.  “I beg your pardon?”\n\n“You have to consume just one bite in order to keep them away.  Keep at it until the beasts leave you alone.  You can either drink someone’s blood or eat any part of their body.  They can also be dead or alive.”\n\nI was not about to turn into a cannibal.  Vomit rose up from my stomach, stinging the back of my throat.  “Well, there has to be other ways I can ward off those beings!  Please tell me that there is another way!”\n\nShe shook her head.  “I don’t know what else to tell you.”\n\nI stared at my frail form, my eyes beginning to water.  There were no other options.  I clenched a fist.  I paid the fee for the psychic, and headed home, realizing it was getting late.\n\n\\---\n\nThat night, I snuck out of my window once more, heading into the garage and picking up a shovel.  Before any of the cameras could detect me, I ran off.\n\nIt took me a half an hour to reach my destination, the city’s graveyard.  Pausing for a moment to catch my breath, I paced towards the nearest grave stone.\n\nIn the distance, I could see the crimson forms plopping to the ground.\n\nThe demons were back.\n\nAdrenaline made me dig up the hole faster than I thought was possible.  I turned around as three more dropped to the forest ground and ran through the foggy night.\n\n“Come on!” I said.\n\nDirt flew away from the hole, leaving a pile right beside it.  I began to sweat as the last two fell to the ground like ripe fruit and sprinted towards me like quarterbacks in the Super Bowl about to score a touchdown.\n\n*Clunk.*\n\nMy shovel hit the hard, polished, maple coffin.  I pried it open, revealing a bloated corpse that reeked of decay.  Maggots ate at his insides.\n\nI puked by the side.  The monsters sprinted even closer, around fifty feet way.\n\nClosing my eyes, I yanked out the dead man’s liver.\n\nThey were not ten feet away when I bit into the bitter, juicy slab of meat.  Purple vortexes surrounded the beasts as they were violently dragged back to the netherworld they came from.\n\nI started sobbing.  I covered up the hole I made, taking the liver with me and hiding it in a plastic bag, and headed home.  It was obvious I was going to need to consume more flesh and I didn’t have the heart to perform that disgusting operation again.  I don’t know exactly if there is an afterlife, but I hope the dead man can forgive me from the heavens.\n\nI pulled out my phone.  It was emergency services.  I hesitated for a second, until I developed the courage to pick it back up.  \n\nTo my luck, I found out that my mother got into a horrible car accident while trying to chase after me, and ended up quadriplegic.\n\nAnd just like that, her life and reputation, shattered in seconds.\n\n\\---\n\nDays later, I was able to take all the camera evidence and finally turn it in to the police.  Now that my mother was finally bedridden, she was powerless.  Those staff that once feared her now started to stand up to her.  Not long after, she was sentenced to prison for her atrocities and would remain in the jail hospital in intensive care for a long time.\n\nI started having much more freedom than before.  I never felt like I deserved it, though.  For days after that accident, I felt like my mom would pop out of the corner, giving me another lashing.  But after dealing with her verbal abuse for so long, I began to get used to it, knowing now that she, for once, wouldn’t be able to do a damn thing.\n\nAs time went on, I began to run out of the dead man’s liver.  I needed a quick supply of human flesh, stat.  Despite being harmed by someone for so long, I would not dare hurt an innocent human.  The only reason why I ate that liver was because I needed to ensure that those demons did not consume the rest of my soul while it was still healing.\n\nThen, I got an idea today.\n\nI walked into my mother’s room, where she laid on her white sheet bed with several other beaten prisoners.  One of the prisoners I had tipped off gave me a shiv, which I hid behind my back.  How was I able to get it past the guards, you ask?  I don’t have a clue.\n\n“Is it time to feast yet, darling?  I asked you to bring me a meal today since you were visiting,” my mom said, smiling and trying to perform an innocent act.\n\n“Don’t call me that,” I returned a smile and took the shiv.  My brow furrowed.  I let out a chuckle, seeing her terrified expression.  I gripped her side, pinching off some of her skin on her side and covering my hand, holding the knife in my right.\n\n“What are you doing, Nora?!  Stop it!” she ordered.  I put a finger on her mouth.\n\nAligning the knife with the skin, I stared at her sinisterly.  For those who are wondering why I don't regret using demons to help me lose weight, you are about to find out.\n\n“You’re damn right mother, it is time to feast,” I smiled as I sawed off part of her skin and abdomen muscle and devoured it.",

        "text": "I have some time and god knows what’s going to happen to me tonight, so I might as well type this out and see if any of you can help me. I’m in the middle of the woods during a snowstorm, last thing I heard from the cops before my phone lines went dead was they’ll send someone up here when it’s safe, my best friend is missing, and there’s a god damn talking bear watching me from the woods. I have the doors locked and the windows barricaded because I think it’s been watching me all day. Luckily the internet is still up, but I don’t know for how long. I can hear it outside, occasionally “laughing” in this husky deep voice, and telling me I smell nice and shit. One of the last thing I heard it say is it will be coming tonight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for rambling, I’m just terrified right now. Some context. James is an old friend of mine since middle school when he got detention for beating up this bully harassing me. He messed the bully up bad, knocking out a few teeth and blackening both of his eyes. I told the teacher the bully had started it and we’ve been best friends ever since. To say James preferred nature to the city would be an understatement. I think he has some kind of social anxiety because whenever he was forced to social gatherings like parties, weddings, and the like, the very next day he would be in the woods, either hunting or hiking. It was like therapy for him. And he had a gift with hunting where whenever he went out, he would usually come back with the biggest game I’ve ever seen. One time he made the news when he got a 12-point deer. To the layman, that’s a large set of antlers, and it was the day after he did jury duty! Something in him attracted the biggest animals around, and I don’t know if that has anything to do with what’s going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had been involved in a lawsuit when his house collapsed on him. It crushed his left arm pretty bad and doctors had to amputate it. He got a good settlement out of it, due to the house being new and faulty construction being the culprit, and immediately set off for Alaska. He had a plan to retire in Alaska, and I guess the house collapse was enough to make him realize that his dreams can’t wait until retirement. And I’m sure the settlement helped realize that as well. He ended up moving to Kodiak, a city on an island by the same name that’s on the southern end of Alaska. But then he went a step further and made a cabin several miles into the woods. I gotta say, getting to the cabin is a bitch. Not only do you have to get to Kodiak by plane or ship, you drive on a precarious road about halfway to a small village called Chiniak, then take a dirt road detour through the mountains – with no guard rails protecting you from the drop, mind you – and THEN take a mile hike up and down a mountain to get to it. But the view of the ocean and woods, on a backdrop of the mountains… Man, I wish everyone could see it once in their lives. I’m not an outdoorsy person by any stretch of the imagination, but the first time I saw the view, I was in awe at what the world can look like at the right parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you figure the logistics must be a nightmare, and they are. James convinced me to move to Anchorage. I would have gone to Kodiak, but I’m too in love with the city life’s conveniences to go that far. He has me on a… Salary. See, he regularly sends me money and once a month or two, I will bring him groceries. I pack up a Chevrolet Express with a sled and enough groceries and other necessities and get it on a ship to Kodiak. Then I drive out to the base of the mountain just before the hiking path over the mountain. James and I then load up the sled with as much as we can carry and bring it to the cabin. During summertime we can do this in one trip, but in wintertime, I can’t visit as much and so I bring more and sometimes can make 2-3 trips. Most of the time I’ll spend a night or two there. I’m not much of a fisher and I couldn’t tell you the difference between a pistol and revolver when it comes to shooting, but we make it work. Well… Usually alcohol helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry again for the huge segue. Part of it was me reminiscing and a part of it was context for where I’m at. The last couple of times I visited, James mentioned being visited by a bear. Keep in mind, Kodiak bears don’t mess around. They’re the largest bears around, polar bears included. They’re not hypercarnivores like polar bears, luckily, so usually only attack due to territory reasons. This bear has piercing and intelligent golden eyes, which is what James said is how he spotted him. The bear’s eyes are golden rings that reflect light so well, you’d think they were glowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways he said this bear would come at night. It made almost no noise and would just watch him from afar. He had been cooking dinner when he saw gold glints and that’s when he found the bear. “Jesus christ!” James shouted. The eyes were about 10 feet off the ground and just outside the lighting of the cabin so James couldn’t tell if it was on its hindlegs or what, but that it was a giant ass animal. He said it cocked its head to the side briefly, then walked away. It began showing up every other night, then every night. Each time, there wouldn’t be a noise, just those eyes in the darkness. They were always in the distance so he couldn’t gauge the full size of the bear. All around the house, it seemed to find a way to watch him. He could be in the basement and see its eyes through the window slits, watching him from the woods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time he was trying to get a cell phone booster working on the roof because blizzards made it impossible to call, when he caught the eyes of the bear. At this point, he had been on and off the roof trying to get it to work and was calling me to test it out. He hadn’t been able to get it to work, and the phone signal was crappy. But I still remember when he was talking with me and he mentioned the bear. At this point, he told me about the bear a couple times and we both figured it was just curious, but this was the first time he was outside when the bear appeared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Listen, I screwed it on right and it says to face the nearest cell tower, which is either Kodiak or Chiniak, but neither are wor – Oh.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What?”\n\n  \n “Nothing. Just, you remember the bear we talked about? Yeah that fucker is back. Maybe he has a den nearby? I don’t know.”\n\n  \n “Well be careful, if he’s as big as you say, I wouldn’t let him get close to the house. Remember my old neighbors, the Stanley’s? Just the other day a bear broke into their basement to get at the moose meat they had in cold storage. Those were metal doors padlocked, and it didn’t-”\n\n  \n “… You look nice.” The phone barely picked up a voice in the distance. It was unusually deep, like someone said it in the middle of yawning. The voice was strange and made me stop talking for a moment. I didn’t hear James for several seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“FUCK-“ I heard James yell and then a series of bangs and rustling like he dropped the phone. “What the fuck!” I heard James again, this time a bit far away from the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“James!” I yelled. The strange voice put me on edge, and some fear slipped into my voice. There was no response for several seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey you there??” James almost yelled in the phone, sounding out of breath. “God damn, that bear is something else.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, he had been hearing a whispering in the woods while on the call with me. He heard someone ask why he’s on the roof while I was talking to him and leaned over the roof to try to see if someone was out there when he heard the voice clearly and loudly, the ‘you smell nice’ phrase I had heard. He looked over where he thought the voice came from and saw the eyes of the bear. But the bear wasn’t still like before. They were quickly approaching from the woods. It ran up to the side of the house and placed a heavy paw on the ladder he set up, which immediately collapsed under its weight. It was getting dark so he couldn’t see most of it, but as it was running forward, it passed by the light coming from the window. Its fur was black, which is strange because Kodiak bears are a subspecies of brown bears and share their coat coloring. The leg he saw was almost the same width as a door frame. But the bear’s head was off. It was much larger than most bears. He only got a brief look at the side of it but it was almost touching the ground. Remember, the bear’s head is around 10 feet from the ground, going by the initial estimates. It looked like it was trying to climb up the ladder when it broke. Something about that spooked the bear and it took off back into the woods. James remained up there and talked with me briefly as he tried to look around for the bear again. When he was convinced the bear wasn’t nearby, he jumped from the roof and booked it into the house. He had considered calling the cops, but what could he tell them? A bear approached his house and there might be someone walking in the woods? Despite that, I managed to convince him to call the cops once he hung up with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried calling him back a few hours later, but no answer. I tried several times that night. The cell reception out there is really bad for most of the year, and during winter it’s worse. When it is that bad, you will get ringing while the receiver has no idea you’re calling. With how bad the snow is, that idea lingered on my mind. I was already planning on visiting him next week, but decided I would try to get there ASAP. At this point I was in Washington as part of my job, and so knew it would be a while before I could get to James’ cabin. I got a flight back to Anchorage as soon as I could, but it still took a day for it to happen. I don’t know how to put it, but the voice I had heard put me in extreme panic mode. It barely sounded human, and if it was, that’s equally scary that someone was that close to a giant bear and still whispering to James. I made up my mind to go there and pick James up and bring him to my place to crash for a few days while we get it sorted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had finally managed to get to Kodiak and then made the drive to the hiking trail used to get to James’ house. I have to admit that when I first got there, I waited a bit and looked around, waiting for golden eyes to appear, but none did. I did bring a gun with me – a 9mm pistol. I know some hunting and gun aficionados will laugh at the thought of a 9mm being used against what might be the world’s largest bear. Honestly, I agree. But a 9mm was all I had for protection and anything else had a long wait time. And besides, 9mm can still do good damage, and if nothing else, the sound scares away most animals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started the hike and during it, heavy snow began. A blizzard was forecasted as a possibility, and I guess it hit earlier than normal. During the hike, I kept my eyes all around me. From what James had said, this bear makes no sound when walking, but its eyes were easily spotted. The walk, fortunately, was uneventful, though I couldn’t hear any animals in the woods. That’s not too surprising, as snow acts like a good sound dampener unless it freezes. But still, with what was going on, it was unnerving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get to the cabin as the snowstorm worsens, and at this point it basically is like fog hanging in the air and reducing visibility. I see that the front door is broken open, and I feel a chill that’s worse than the air around me. I enter the house and there’s no one. I call out for James and, thinking about the voice, if anyone else is in there. No response. I listen carefully for any sort of breathing, wood creak, anything. And it’s just dead silent inside besides the wind buffeting the side of the cabin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the entry way, you make a left turn to go into the living room, and the rug that’s normally in the entryway has been swept to the right and into the kitchen. The living room is chaos. The moose skin rug has been ripped apart, the table and couch flattened, and the inside wall facing the opposite the window has a tremendous depression in it that extends its entire length and height where wood has either bent or shattered. The ceiling had several support beams about 12 feet above the floor, which had been torn through, with their splinters filling in 3 large holes in the wood flooring, wide enough that I could have sat in the middle of them without hitting any of the edges. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kitchen is largely intact, besides the entrance rug that found its way onto the stove. The fact that the kitchen was left alone was surprising to say the least. Bears go by scent a lot of the time, and I know James usually keeps fresh moose in the freezer and fridge. A bear would much prefer an easy meal to one that fights back, and with how good their noses are, there is little doubt they would have smelled the moose once inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‘The bear broke in and attacked James’ was my immediate thought. But there’s no blood anywhere. Bears aren’t exactly graceful hunters, and if James was attacked there should have been blood on the floor. No torn bits of clothing, no hair, no fur. I look in the backyard where James had been building a porch and said it would be done by the time I visited next. And I see the porch – completely destroyed. Splintered wood and metal railing litter the floor, with some intact wooden stakes upright, a couple with loosely connected bits of flooring. Had the bear tried to enter through the back? I was trying to piece together what happened when I heard something that hit me in the gut.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You smell good.” It was the same voice I had heard over the phone, but louder and clearer. It must have been somewhere deeper in the woods. I quickly run to shut the front door, but remembered it was broken. In my panic to close and lock it as fast as possible, I basically slam it into the door frame with a loud thud. I was filled with immense regret and scared shitless at the fuck up. If the bear was wondering, now it knew; someone else now was in the cabin. Luckily the door had a deadbolt on the inside. For some reason, it wasn’t used when the door was broken through, and so both sections remained intact. I know it probably seems stupid, thinking a deadbolt could hold back a bear, but I had no other option. I lock the deadbolt and sat against the door, trying to pull my phone out of my jacket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I’m doing this, I look around, remembering James mentioning it had someone managed to spot him no matter where he was in the house. And sure enough… I see it through the living room window. It was looking at me from the edge of the house with only half the face visible. With how still it was, it took a moment to register an animal, when I realized something. He was fucking peeking at me, like some pervert! With how massive it was, how did I not see it when he peeked from the corner?? Was he watching me the whole time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m paralyzed with fear, so am unwillingly seeing more of this monster. His fur is darker than a black bear’s and his eye was a glowing gold ring that hung in the upper portion of a tremendous shadow. I thought he was standing just outside the corner, but as I am frozen in fear watching him, I realize something that, to be honest, made me cry out a bit. He wasn’t stepping out from the corner. It was its head. His head extended to where it lightly brushed the ground. This immense shadow watching me could easily fit James or I inside it. And it’s half. Its. Face. I’m trying desperately to tell me body to move, when it speaks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It’s too cold to run, you better stay inside.” The same voice as over the phone, a deep unnatural tone. I don’t see teeth or a mouth, but the way the lower part of the shadow moved made me realize its lower jaw was moving. I scream. The connection of the voice to the bear somehow shattered the inability to move and I realize I am yanking at the pistol I have in the holster. The holster is a new one and I fumbled with it. As I do, the face withdraws from the corner of the building. I don’t hear it run away and honestly am not sure if it wasn’t just hiding behind the corner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I am glad it went away, because with the terror I had been feeling, I have no doubt I would have tried to shoot it through the living room window. I doubt it would have done much to it, but it would have shattered the window and exposed me to the blizzard outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited for several minutes before moving. My whole body felt heavy, possibly from adrenaline wearing off. I decide before I do anything, to call the police. My phone has absolutely shitty reception out in the cabin, but it still manages to connect. I tell the dispatcher on the other end where I am at and then that my friend had disappeared, and a bear was outside the house. The dispatcher asked me if I wasn’t sure James hadn’t just gone into town to escape the blizzard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He can’t, it’s impossible. He has no car.”\n\n  \n “Normally when a blizzard as bad as this is forecasted, many people living in the woods come into town and wait it out.”\n\n  \n “You’re not listening, I said he doesn’t have a car!”\n\n  \n “Calm down sir, I’m just trying to find the most reasonable answer here. He could have called someone to pick him up. It sounds like your friend disappeared, and with no one around to scare away that bear, it managed to get into the house, probably smelling food.”\n\n  \n “The bear is still here!”\n\n  \n “I understand that. Listen, bears don’t like dealing with people. It saw you were in the house, probably didn’t think it was worth the trouble to get into the house.”\n\n  \n “But it s-“ I cut myself off here. I was about to say it spoke to me, but there’s no way that would have helped my case. I was getting the feeling the dispatcher likely thought I was some tourist or something, dealing with wild animals the first time in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will advise Kodiak PD of your situation, but with how the blizzard is, we likely won’t get anyone out there for a while. I recommend keeping your doors and windows shut – any open door or window can lose heat rapidly which is hard to get back. If you see the bear again, and you think it’s getting too close, bang on the window or shout at it. It’s just curious and that shou-“ The line went dead after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nI look at my phone, and I see the no signal symbol on the screen. The wind picks up and I’m reminded that this blizzard is just beginning to pick up. Even without the bear, going outside and trying to make it to my car would likely be my death. It’s getting colder outside and the wind and snow are picking up. I’m trapped in this house and likely won’t be able to leave for some time. Luckily the fireplace has some wood next to it, and the cabin is well insulated so I can ration the wood out for several days. I am working out my next couple of steps when I hear a bizarre and deep “heh.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound is like a single laugh, but there’s no actual emotion in it and it sounds closer to someone waking up from a deep sleep and trying to say their first word. I look around and see the bear again. It had retreated into the woods, making it hard to see it clearly. But even with the increasing snow, those eyes are unmistakable. It was staring at me, unmoving. There’s no curiosity behind that stare. Hell, it’s hard to even say there’s life behind that gaze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, I got more of my wits about me and know not to shoot the window out like a dumbass. A mixture of fear and bravery makes me directly face it. Perhaps part of the bravery is it is still a good ways away, but I still shout at it. “What the hell do you want??” I tried to sound brave as I shouted, but there’s no denying that I sounded scared shitless. For a second, I feel stupid, cause I just shouted while still inside the house with wood, glass, and 20 feet or so of outdoor weather between us. I could hear it, but it could be that that’s because it’s a huge fucking bear. I don’t know if it actually heard me, but even if it didn’t, it saw me trying to communicate with it. Because in response, the bear took a small step closer, and I almost fall through the kitchen floor as I instinctively step back. Then I hear the voice, through the blizzard and my own house, I hear it speak. “Getting dark. I’ll come in then.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I realized I am on a sharp timeline. It is indeed getting dark pretty fast. I don’t know why the bear hasn’t just barreled into the house and killed me. With how big it is, it seems like it would have no trouble breaking apart the building to get to me. It first appeared to James at night and made its move when James was on the roof when it got dark. But it also ran on small things like the ladder breaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy phone still doesn’t have a signal. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the case for several days. I immediately start moving shit around to barricade myself in. I push furniture against the door and a dresser on the largest window. I managed to find some 2x4s lying around, likely from James’ porch project, as well as a hammer and some nails. I nail the boards over the back porch door. A part of me feels like a fool doing all this. Like I said, the bear is huge and everything I set up feels like it wouldn’t even make a difference in how fast it could get to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was barricading everything I could see, I could hear strange sounds outside. I had not heard this bear walk at all before then, but heard sounds like the wall creaking, as if under stress. I look at the huge indentation in the living room wall and can only imagine the bear pressing against a wall for some reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne last thing. I had went ahead and started working on the fire. I hadn’t realized how cold it was in the house due to the door being left open until I had barricaded the doors. I got a couple logs in it and a Firestarter brick. The brick’s fire started and there must have been some lighter fluid or gas in it previously as it ignited in a sudden flash. Just as it does, I hear a weird “Ah?” From outside. I turn around and I see it. I don’t know how I didn’t see it earlier as the shadow was blocking almost all light from the side of the house. But between two planks of wood against the kitchen window, its golden eye is watching me. No light coming from the window, just the golden ring, glowing by the illumination of the fire. It was looking at the fire, but then there was a small change in the eyes and I realized it was now watching me. Then it said something that has haunted me since: “He’s alive. Soon, you will too.” I was frozen in fear as it watched me for a second, before it ran off. This time I heard the footsteps, or more closely, felt them. Even with the snow dampening the sound, the first several steps rattled the house and caused the dishes in the kitchen to clank together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I’m really terrified and have no cell service. Luckily I still have internet due to a dedicated fiber optic line. I haven’t looked around the house much… So much happened so quickly, I felt like I have not had time to do anything besides barricading the house, but with how big it is, that probably was a waste of time. And now the sun is going to set in a couple hours. You can’t tell in the blizzard where exactly the sun is, but there’s a dampening of light bridging into twilight that gives you a rough estimate sometimes. As I’ve been typing this I’ve been wary of my surroundings and occasionally see a shadow move from the side of the house, and occasionally I hear terrible sounds outside… I think it’s scratching or chewing on parts of the house. I’ve seen coon hounds do that on a tree when they’re excited about a scent. And on occasion I’ll hear a sound like a laugh, but deeper and just a single syllable. And what it said stuck with me. Is James alive? Was it lying to me? If so, why? I’m filled with ideas and theories on what it means, none of it feels good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m just hoping someone here has some sort of experience or advice that would help me get through the night. Just the night, at least.",

        "text": "My wife heard me sobbing in my sleep again last night. She later told me I'd been trembling too, and that was what had woken her up. \n\n\n\"Ron, it's been six months! You've got to talk to a therapist now. I'll come with you\", she said. The desperation was clear in her voice.\n\n\nI stared at the pattern on the blanket and waited for reality to slowly set in. When it did, it didn't bring much relief. I'd gotten better at putting up a facade of normalcy in the last couple of months, but the darkness had slowly crept into my dreams. You can only pretend when you're awake.\n\n\n\"What was it today?\" she asked.\n\n\n\"Same as always, flashbacks of being bullied at school\", I lied.\n\n\nShe held my head tightly to her stomach and let out an exasperated sigh that let me know I hadn't sounded convincing. \"I don't get it. Why don't you just tell me what happened in the summer? I'm trying to help you but I hate being blocked out like this! I can respect your space but it's hard for me seeing you suffer like this!\"\n\n\n\"I'm fine. I've always had these phases. It'll pass\", I lied again, feeling the cold sweat on my forehead.\n\n\n\"What phases?? I've never seen you this way before, it only started after you got back from Skokie! Why don't you just tell me what happened?? Please!\", she failed to avoid raising her voice, and to be honest I didn't blame her. \n\n\n\"Don't worry. It'll pass\".\n\n\nI got out of bed and walked to the window. The snow was falling gently outside.\n\n\n\"I'm gonna go finish up that thing I'm writing\", I told her after a while, still staring into the white darkness.\n\n\n\"What? Are you – Ron, it's three in the morning!!!\" \n\n\n\"I think it'll help when I'm done with it\". I walked up to her and kissed her cheek. I could see the tears starting to form around her eyes, and it broke my heart to see it.\n\n\nI put on a shirt and made my way to the bathroom to wash my face, before heading off to my study.\n\n\nHalfway there, I felt an overwhelming sadness come over me as I pictured her teary eyes again.\n\n\nI walked back, peeping in through the door to see her sitting on the bed holding her head in her hands. \"I love you\", I said, hoping she wouldn't spot the uncertainty in my voice. \n\n\n***\n\n\nI wish there was another place to begin from, but the truth is it started with a phonecall I got around midnight last May, right after I had finished making love to my Linda, my wife.\n\n\n\"What? Who on earth…\" I groaned as I felt around for my phone on the bedside table, broken out of a stupor that was on the verge of drifting seamlessly into sleep.\n\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\n\"...Ronald Cheeseman?\" a scratchy voice on the other side asked after a brief pause.\n\n\n\"Yeah?\" I mumbled groggily.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\"Yes? Who is this?\"\n\n\nI was sure I heard some sniffling this time, but once again, no response. The sound told me there was no problem with the line though.\n\n\n\"Look I don't mean to be rude, but I hope you have a good reason for calling at this hour, whoever you are\".\n\n\nLinda was now awake, and widened her eyes at me briefly to ask what was going on. I made a clueless face and shook my head at her.\n\n\nI was just about to give the anonymous caller a telling off, when he finally spoke again.\n\n\n\"Ronny? This is Al. Al Blank\".\n\n\nI sat up hurriedly.\n\n\n\"Al? Wow…uhh, what's up? Is everything okay? What's wrong with your voice?\"\n\n\nEven as I asked, I could tell he had either been crying, or had a bad cold. Given the long silences and what I had heard about Al the last time I'd heard of him, I could tell it probably wasn't a cold.\n\n\n\"Ronny, how is everything? How's Linda?\" he asked hoarsely.\n\n\n\"Good, good. What about you? Wow, I thought I'd never hear from you again. You've been completely off radar for so long\". \n\n\nMy words felt weirdly formal, especially addressing a guy I had gone to both school and university with. I guess that's what happens when you haven't spoken to someone in nearly 10 years.\n\nI couldn't make up my mind on whether to say \"sorry about your divorce\", given how long ago it was. I also wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to remind him about it, knowing the circumstances that led up to it. \n\n\n\"Hey, Al? Is everything okay, man? Is there something you wanted to say?\"\n\n\nMore silence.\n\n\n\"You there, buddy?\"\n\n\nI couldn't help but feel conscious about how unnatural the \"buddy\" sounded, but I was genuinely concerned for him. I wanted to at least try to make him feel comfortable with my words, not that I could do anything else.\n\n\n\"Listen man… I think… I mean I am…struggling a little bit. Things aren't great, they haven't been for a while\".\n\n\n\"Okay. You wanna talk about it? I'm here to listen\" \n\n\n\"Yeah. I guess I have no other choice\".\n\n\n\"Well, I'm listening. You can take your time\". I had school the next day, but I couldn't just leave Al this way, no matter how sudden this was.\n\n\n\"Ronny, I've got something to ask you\".\n\n\n\"Sure, go on\".\n\n\n\"Can you come over to my place for a few days? I think I need it. I think I need to talk to someone\".\n\n\n\"Umm… I think so? Are you still in Skokie?\" I said unsurely. I didn't want to say no, but trying to squeeze in a weekend trip to Skokie (from Cleveland) would be tough given the heavy end of term workload. Besides, it seemed like he wanted someone around for more than a couple of days. \"Is it okay if I did that next month once summer holidays start? Or if you want to come over here I could go over this Friday and drive you back to my place the next day. Linda and I would love to catch up with you!\" \n\n\nI somehow knew asking him to drive himself wouldn't be a good idea, and to be honest, I wasn't sure if he was allowed to, or if he even had a car anymore. I didn't want to risk embarrassing him by asking.\n\n\n\"I don't want Linda to see me … like this. And I don't really think I can leave the house either. It's complicated. I'll tell you when you're here. Next month is fine though. Yeah, still here in Skokie\". Al blew his nose, his voice sounded sad and distant.\n\n\n\"Alright\", I said, immediately knowing what he meant by \"like this\", even though he didn't elaborate. \"You sure you're gonna hold up fine till then? Do you have someone else there with you? Anyone to talk to? Are you seeing a professional of some kind?\"\n\n\n\"Don't worry. It's not a… not a time thing. I just need to get some things off my chest … or so I think. And some company … well that would help. I can wait a month. I live alone now. Becca and I got divorced by the way…I mean … that was a long while ago\". Al seemed to be shifting from talking to me to softly muttering to himself midway through his sentences, and I strained to catch everything he was saying. \n\n\n\"Yes…I'd heard. I tried to reach out to you but you just disappeared off the face of the earth, man! All social media accounts gone, and your number was unreachable too. And then…yeah\". I stopped myself mid-sentence.\n\n\n\"So you know then\".\n\n\nI kept quiet. I wasn't sure if what I knew counted as much or too little, and I was worried about either of those two possibilities. \n\n\n\"I just wa–\"\n\n\n\"Ronny\", Al spoke at the same time as me after a shared pause. I waited for him to go first. \"I'm so sorry I called you like this… in the middle of the night. But please just know that I had to. I'll hang up now. I'll finish up some work and I've… got an early start tomorrow. I guess you need to sleep too. Sorry if I woke you. I hope… I look forward to seeing you next month. Bye\".\n\n\nAl hung up without waiting for me to say bye, or that I hoped he knew he could call me whenever. His voice was getting heavier towards the end and it seemed like he was about to cry again. I noticed I had walked out of the bedroom, naked, while on the call. I also found my heart racing with a mix of anxiety and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. When I went back in, I could tell from Linda's concerned face that I seemed a bit dazed. I told her everything Al had said, except the part where he said he didn't want her to see him \"like this\". She knew Al too, of course, but not nearly as well as I did. \n\n\n***\n\n\nAl Blank was one of the more curiously interesting people I knew. For the most part, I had personally thought of Al as the good kind of interesting. Around the time I had last heard of him though, calling him \"interesting\" would have been a rather cruel euphemism to describe the utterly bizarre and tragic set of circumstances that had befallen him.\n\n\n'Al' was short for Ally, but it had once been short for Alireza, the name he was born with. Strangely, it was his caucasian mother, not his half-Persian father called George who had strongly insisted on that name. I guess that's the kind of thing you do when you are deeply in love and find the world full of new and wonderful possibilities. You don't think about the fact that a child called Alireza Blank could end up being an introvert who would hate being forced into having a five-minute conversation about his \"strange\" name, his multi-ethnic family, and what his religion actually was, every time he met someone new. You also don't think about the possibility that if things went south, that five-minute conversation would often have to end with a mention of his parents' divorce.\n\n\nBy the time you're in middle-school, kids pick on the tiniest of things that stand out about you, and a guy with a first name and a last name that didn't seem to go together was an easy target. I didn't exactly have it easy myself with a name like Cheeseman, but Al had it way worse, sometimes bordering on really malicious stuff. Adolescents can be the most vicious people sometimes, especially since, unlike adults, they often don't have to risk losing a job or being socially shunned over it.\n\n\nIt was probably all the unwanted attention (and possibly his parents' divorce) that made Al officially change his name to Ally right after he graduated from high school. It didn't make any difference to the people who knew him though. We still called him Al, same as before.\n\n\nOf course, the curious history of his name isn't even half of what made Al's story fascinating. \n\n\nNow this may sound like an impolite thing to say about someone, but growing up, he was about the most invisible kid you could imagine. He looked positively bored with the mundane realities of everyday life, and wanted no part in it whatsoever.  His short, pudgy frame didn't betray even the slightest bit of athletic ability. Heck, he wasn't even interested in watching or following sport … or anything else that kids his age liked to watch or talk about! His grades at school were consistently poor. He couldn't sketch, paint, sing, dance, play an instrument, speak in public, and never showed interest in any of these things either. He even hated being outside! \n\n\nOne would possibly put this down to the bullying he faced, but here's the thing: I'd known him since first grade and the bullying only really started around seventh grade when the kids started fully imbibing all the nasty stuff from their parents and surroundings. It was around eight grade when his parents got divorced too. But he was always that way from the beginning! \n\n\nHe even sat next to me for the whole year in fourth grade, and despite my best attempts, I could barely even call him a friend by the end of it. He hated talking, and preferred to stare outside the window to look at the squirrels instead. He wasn't shy or timid. In fact, he had a quiet, foreboding sort of confidence that added something of a mystique about him. While he did answer when spoken to, he would look mildly irritated at being forced to put his complex thoughts into words for us mortals. He may well have had some sort of secret superiority complex, but if he did, he was too unbothered to tell us even that. \n\n\nI'd been to his house, and his parents both seemed perfectly nice. His dad was very quiet and mild-mannered, his mom was a bit eccentric but seemed to love children. No one ever heard about any problems with the Blanks, and while the divorce came as a surprise, it was about as \"mutual\" as a divorce can get, with both parents continuing on civil terms. For all intents and purposes, Alireza Blank was a nihilistic grandpa stuck in the body of a plump little kid who perhaps quietly thought he was better than everyone else for reasons best known to him.\n\n\nIn ninth grade, something happened that changed him for good. Maybe it was because he was already getting called names by that time, or maybe it was his parents, but he had become more detached than ever by that time. Then, one day, he made the mistake of crossing our English teacher, Mrs. Shaw. Mrs. Shaw, may god rest her soul, was a tiny woman with white frizzy hair who loved putting the fear of god into kids twice her size, and often their parents as well.\n\n\nThat year, we were asked to submit a final term essay at least 1500 - 2000 words long. That's a lot of words for a ninth grader, and all of us cursed and grumbled our way through it for a whole week, knowing there was a C+ waiting for us at the end if we were lucky. I'm sure Al hated it too, seeing as he submitted an essay that consisted of three short sentences. \n\n\nMrs. Shaw gave him the worst kind of dressing down that you could still get away with as a teacher back then. Nowadays you'd be straight up fired from your job if you said some of the things she said to Al that day, and in front of the whole class too.\n\n\nI won't go into the unsavory details, but she brought up everything from the divorce to the reason why she *really* thought he gets bullied by others. Stuff like that doesn't just come from wanting to discipline a student, but feeling personally insulted by one. It got pretty ugly and most of us were wishing we could leave halfway through it. By the end of it, Al was in tears. I'd never seen him cry before. None of us had.\n\n\nSurprisingly, it did the trick. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, Al started making a concerted effort to talk to people and put himself more out there. He was still very much an introvert, but he no longer looked like he pitied everyone else's existence anymore. He even got pretty good at taking jokes at his own expense, laughing along with others. That sort of thing really goes a long way in dissuading bullies, for the most part. Like I said, Al was never really short on confidence.\n\n\nHe never quite got into any co-curriculars, but he did start putting more effort into his studies. And while most of his grades went up from poor to average, he reserved his best efforts for English class. We had Mrs. Shaw again in tenth grade. All of us received the shock of our lives when, almost exactly a year after that unpleasant incident, Al got an A in his tenth grade English final assignment. No one else had scored above a B+, with most of us scoring lower.\n\n\nMrs. Shaw, a woman who looked like she had never smiled at anyone in her life, made Al stand up and had the whole class applaud him for his incredible turnaround. She then had him read out the whole essay to us. She told us it was the best she'd read at this level in her twenty five years of teaching. All of us cheered as Al went very red in the face. Big Bob Watkins, the guy we jokingly called Mrs. Shaw's son because he sat on a wheelchair right beside her desk, later swore he saw her tear up and that the rest of us couldn't see it from the front because of her extremely thick glasses. We didn't believe him of course, we thought that was taking it too far.\n\n\nAl and I weren't really close in school. That only happened when we ended up in the same English Literature program at university. We hadn't coordinated our applications or anything, and it was a pleasant surprise to see him in my class on the first day. When you're in a new place and nervous, you tend to stick to people you already know. We grew real tight pretty quick.\n\n\nAl was driven by two pursuits during our freshman year. One, he decided he never wanted to go to work and instead would follow his passion to become a full-time writer. When I say he \"decided\" that, I don't mean he casually shared that desire with his peers and professors. He became wholly fixated on it, the same way he hadn't let himself rest until he had wrenched an A out of Mrs. Shaw in tenth grade. In a way it made complete sense. Writing was the only thing he was good at, and perhaps more importantly the one thing that gave him a sense of purpose and identity. \n\n\nHe also developed a strong infatuation towards a tall, freckled girl from the Anthropology department. It just happens that I'd signed up for a beginner-level anthropology course for reasons totally unrelated to the girl, and naturally Al asked me to set him up with her. Now, no one believes me when I told them, but I swear I didn't know she would fall for me instead, despite my best efforts to put in several good words for Al. In time, I fell in love with her too, and that's how Linda Brooking became Mrs. Linda Cheeseman seven years later.\n\n\nIf Al had any negative feelings when Linda and I started dating, he did a pretty good job of hiding it. Apart from giving us more space as a couple, he still spoke to me the same way and sat next to me in class. He always remained a shy and awkward around Linda, but he was that way around women in general. \n\n\nBut one spurned pursuit drove him to double down harder on the other one. The one he had full control over, from his end at least. Two years after we graduated, I was finishing my post-grad and had moved in with Linda. Al, on the other hand, had shown zero desire to either apply for a job, or to continue studying. Meanwhile, he had signed up to about a dozen writers' clubs, had hired and fired a literary agent, and had approached countless publishers with all sorts of manuscripts. \n\n\n\"You've got to have a back-up plan, you know\", Linda had told him on one of his rare dinner visits to our former Chicago apartment. \"Your dedication is admirable, and I'm sure something will work out, but people just making it big as an author off the bat like that is rare. All great authors were doing something else before they got published. That's just how it works!\"\n\n\nAl had shuffled uncomfortably, mumbled something, and stole a quick sideways glance at me. He had made me promise I wouldn't tell Linda that he was dating a girl called Becca at the time, lest she double down on him needing to get a job. I would've told him the same thing, of course, but I knew better than to argue with him knowing full well I wouldn't win.\n\n\nWhen I said bye to him that night, I knew he didn't appreciate the nagging and wasn't gonna turn up or stay in touch for a while. I was more right than I had thought.\n\n\nI next heard from him more than a year later. It was a phonecall from the man himself.\nThe bastard had only gone and gotten himself published! He asked me if I'd like to pre-order a copy and of course I said yes! \n\nBut that wasn't nearly the end of it! When it hit the shelves, the book started selling like hot cake. It sold around 7000 copies in its opening week, and continued to be on the nationwide bestseller list for the first month and a half! For a debut novelist to pull that off was the stuff of dreams. The kind of dream that only Al could've dared to dream without a backup plan. \n\n\nFunnily enough, and I hate saying this about a friend's work, I didn't quite see the appeal after reading it. It was your average murder mystery with a somewhat interesting twist at the end that I frankly saw coming before I got halfway through. But heck, what the hell did I, an English teacher at your run-of-the-mill school know how these things work! And even if it was a fluke, even if these things are just a matter of luck and good publicity, I wasn't gonna begrudge Al his moment in the sun after he had busted his gut for it for so long!\n\n\nNow, when you sell those kinds of numbers as an author, it goes without saying that you're going to earn yourself a book deal. Al announced it to the guests after getting quite drunk at his own wedding, which happened three months after he got published. I got pretty drunk myself and Linda had to drive us home the next morning. I didn't know it then, but that was the last time I would see Al.\n\n\nWe would occasionally talk over the phone until around two to three years afterwards, when things took a weird turn. Al's second book came out. It was the second installment in the initial deal he had signed. \n\nI didn't find it any better or worse than the first one, but it didn't come anywhere close in terms of success. In fact, considering it was from a bestselling author, it wouldn't be harsh to say that it did pretty badly. But that wasn't the weird part.\n\n\nAbout a week after the book came out, Al had a psychotic episode. He got violent at home with Becca, and accused her of colluding with his own mother in conspiring against him or trying to kill him. He then proceeded to try to take his own life, failed, and subsequently went through a prolonged treatment for schizophrenia. \n\n\nIt was around this point that he cut off all contact with me, and indeed with nearly everyone else he knew. Becca would pick up when I would call, telling me he wasn't available, or it wasn't a good time. I didn't know whether to trust her, until one day when he picked up himself and told me he didn't want me to call again. \n\n\nThe last time I heard about Al was from a mutual friend, at a high school reunion many years ago. Al had cut him off too, but his wife knew someone in Becca's immediate family. They'd told him that Becca had gotten herself a divorce after Al displayed further bouts of unexplained rage. \n\nHe told me something else about Al which to this day makes me feel uneasy to think about, even when I try to see it through the prism of mental illness. Apparently, a few months before the divorce happened, Al had submitted another manuscript. Not to his regular publishers, who by that time had canceled the book deal for obvious reasons. In fact, it wasn't a novel at all, but a short story, if you could call it one.\n\nWhat it really was was a rambly, badly-written essay about his dog. It had no characters nor a plot. Just meaningless, disconnected details about what the dog liked to do all day. \n\n\n***\n\n\nWhen I pulled up to Al's driveway that summer, my stomach sank a bit. It was completely overrun by weeds that were spilling over from the filthy front lawn. The house looked like it had seen much better days, with the paint peeling off in many places. Linda and I had discussed the possibility that Al might be in need of money, and if I should make the offer myself without waiting for him to ask. That seemed increasingly likely now.\n\n\nAl was waiting for me near the rusted garage door, which I could tell he had been trying to unjam for a while. When I got out, he stared blankly at me for a good few seconds before breaking into what felt like a forced smile and offered his hand, which I shook. He had lost most of his hair, which made him look older than he was supposed to at his age. His eyes looked like he didn't get much sleep. \n\n\nWe exchanged pleasantries before Al led me inside. The first thing that hit me was a mild musty smell that comes with a lack of ventilation. The second thing I noticed, once my eyes adjusted to the poor light, was the massive amounts of junk that cramped the living space. Discarded boxes, heaps of paper tied together with rope, and the whole gamut that comes with being a hoarder.\n\n\nI didn't know where to start as I sat down on the sofa with a bunch of old files stacked to one side. Al wasn't saying much, and in fact looked mildly irritated by my presence.\n\n\n\"Damn shame\", he finally said, kicking at the floor.\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing you'd want to know about now, at any rate. Unless you're okay with breaking into someone's house. Are you?\"\n\n\nI widened my eyes.\n\n\n\"I'm joking\", he said, shaking his head.\n\n\nI wasn't so sure he was.\n\n\n\"Al, what's going on with you? I'm sorry but all this…you wanna talk to me? I'm here to talk, or listen to you\"\n\n\n\"That's why I asked you to come here. But it's not the right time now. They won't be here till next week, so we just have to stick it out for the weekend. Sorry about the house being a mess, you can take the extra bedroom upstairs. That one's pretty uncluttered. If you've got something to say about all the stuff I have in here, don't\".\n\n\n\"They…?\"\n\n\n\"You'll know\", he quipped dismissively.\n\n\nI looked at Al and felt uncomfortable by a returning sense of familiarity that was growing in me. This wasn't the Al I knew after tenth grade. This was the one I had known in elementary school and through most of middle school. Completely shut off from the world, forced civility betraying the unmistakable hint of irritation in the company of others. That silent arrogance was back, as if there was a whole world inside his mind he didn't want to share with anyone. I guess the rough times he had endured had weathered away at his carefully built social pretenses, but then why had he called me here?\n\n\nIt goes without saying that I was also seriously questioning his mental balance at this point. \n\n\n\"You get out of there if he starts making you uncomfortable, you hear me?\" Linda said over the phone on my second night there.\n\n\nI was in the extra bedroom upstairs, which, while mostly empty, didn't seem like it had been opened in a long time. Thick layers of dust lined the floor and the odd piece of furniture. On the wall was a framed picture of Becca, Al's former wife, with her arm around a large doberman, and another one of Al and Becca smiling at the camera, with the same doberman beside them. \n\n\n\"I will. But I don't know how to ask if he needs money. He's acting like he doesn't even want to talk to me. He literally shushed me when I tried to make conversation at breakfast\", I told Linda.\n\n\n\"Yeah I'm not sure either. I think just let it be, or maybe try to slip it into conversation if you get the chance\", she said.\n\n\nI did exactly that over the weekend, casually broaching on the subject while we were picking out some stuff from the nearby departmental store. It was the first time we had left the house that weekend, and I assumed it was meant to break the ice, but he barely spoke. When I asked, Al gave me a look of disappointment that immediately made me regret it.\n\n\n\"I know you're confused. You'll see soon enough\".\n\n\nAfter several more attempts at trying to get him to talk to me, I made up my mind to leave at the earliest chance. I did not feel qualified enough to help him, and he was strongly resisting all attempts at conversation. I didn't want to drag a grown adult to a doctor against his wishes, besides, these things never work if the person isn't willing to talk.\n\n\nAnd to be perfectly honest, I was starting to get a bit spooked by this point, and there was absolutely nothing to do in this place when your host wasn't even up for conversation. I fell asleep that night while trying to think of excuses to leave early the next day, and if I could find other ways of finding him the help he clearly needed.\n\n\nI don't know how long I'd slept, but I was jolted awake by Al shaking the daylights out of me. \n\nI let out a cry in horror as I took in what was happening. \n\n\"Ron, WAKE UP! THEY'RE HERE! They're fucking here!\" he hissed loudly, almost menacingly.\n\n\"Al, what the — what is wrong with you?\" I said, trying to shake him off.\n\n\"COME ON, there's no fucking time. You want to see this, I've been waiting to show you for so long!\"\n\n\n\"Show what? Al — \" I protested as he held my collar and nearly dragged me out of the room, as much as someone half-a-foot shorter than you can manage. \n\n\nI was wide awake now, and could see Al's eyes crazed with excitement, the veins on his neck protruding as he muscled me into his room. \n\n\nWhat on earth was he going to show me?\n\n\nIf the circumstances were any different, I'd go on for a bit about just how bad the smell in Al's room was. But presently he forced me down on his bed, right beside the closed window that overlooked the street outside his house. \n\n\n\"You see that?\" he hissed softly, pointing to a car that was pulling into the garage across the street.\n\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, bewildered.\n\n\n\"You're gonna need this\", he said, handing me a pair of binoculars. \"And don't make a noise or they'll hear you. That's why I've kept the lights off\".\n\n\n\"Al… seriously. You've got to stop. You've got to stop this man\", I said, pushing them away. \n\n\n\"Just take a look. If you think I've wasted your time you can get me admitted in any psych ward of your choice\", he said, still pointing to the car across the street.\n\n\nI started saying what I wanted to say, before deciding not to. I indulged Al, more out of fear for my safety if I didn't comply than anything else.\n\n\nI looked through the binoculars as two figures exited the garage. One was a short woman whose greyish white hair seemed to glisten under the street light as she locked the door behind her. She proceeded to push a rather large young man on a wheelchair towards the front door of their house. They were talking, though I couldn't hear what they were saying through the closed glass window in Al's room.\n\n\nNot that I cared for that, because my jaw was already on the floor by this point. A cold shiver ran through my spine as my brain was trying to make sense of what my eyes were seeing. It was Mrs. Shaw and Big Bob Watkins. Of course, the shock would have come from the sheer bizarreness of them living together for some unfathomable reason. Except for the small matter that they also looked exactly as they did from the time I knew them at school, over 18 years ago. There was no way Bob could still have looked like that well into his late-30s, and both Al and I had been to Mrs. Shaw's funeral during our final year at university.\n\n\nI turned to Al in shock, who had pre-emptively put a finger on his lips. His eyes were wide and had a crazed look about them.\n\n\n\"Al\", I whispered, my hands trembling as their grip on the binoculars loosened. \"What the fuck?!\"\n\n\nAl slowly pulled his finger away from his lips, that maniacal look still on his face\n\n\n\"You would've thought I'm crazy if I told you instead of showing you\", he whispered back. \"But this isn't even half of it. This isn't even the craziest part\".\n\n\n\n[To be continued]",

        "text": "If you’ve never heard of the Dullahan, he’s very similar to Sleepy Hollow’s headless horseman. The Dullahan is the Irish God of Death, a title he gained after defeating the previous God of Death, Donn. Legend has it, during this battle, Donn decapitated the Dullahan (when he wasn’t headless) but he survived the decapitation and ended up defeating Donn with help from Donn’s messenger who betrayed him, the Banshee. \n\nThe Dullahan rides a big black horse with flaming eyes. His head is placed on the saddle in front of him, always smiling and he uses a human spine as a whip. Hanging off the side of the saddle is a bucket of human blood. When the Dullahan calls your name you die instantly, and if you see him ride and he catches you, he throws the bucket of blood on you, marking you as his next victim. You’ll know the Dullahan is coming when the sky turns red and the ground shakes in sync with the gallops of his horse. \n\nOn October 30th at 11.59pm every 7 years, the Dullahan rides through our village. Everybody in the village has the date marked on their calendar and at 11.30 on the day he rides, the whole village goes into their homes, closes their curtains and waits for him to pass through. \n\nLast year, I wanted to witness this headless horseman ride. I live a small bit outside the village so at around 11.40 I started walking in. I arrived at the village at 11.50 and spent about 5 minutes looking for a decent hiding spot. I found a nice spot up on a tree in the middle of the village and waited impatiently for the Dullahan's arrival. \n\nAt 11.58, the sky turned red and the Earth shook beneath me. I knew he was coming. At that moment I thought “this would be cool to show people tomorrow” so I took out my phone, pointed it in the direction he came from and I hit the record button. \n\nAt 11.59 exactly, the horseman ascended from the ground like an angry zombie rising from its grave. He rode through the village, each gallop shaking the ground. Because of these tremors, I accidentally dropped my phone out of my hand. I was hoping he didn’t hear the phone drop but I wasn’t that lucky. The horse trotted over to where the phone dropped. The Dullahan picked up the phone and placed the phone in front of his head, then with his left hand, the hand he used to hold the reins, he picked up his head and pointed it towards where I was hiding. I quickly hid behind the trunk and tried to stay as quiet as I could. Then I felt the spine whip wrap around me and I was pulled from the tree. \n\n“Mr. Cagney” said the Dullahan, with his Demonic voice and thick Irish accent “You saw me ride, Mr. Cagney”\n\n“I didn’t, I swear” \n\n“What’s this then, Mr. Cagney?” he asked showing me the video\n\n“I-….”\n\nHe placed a finger to his lips\n\n“Shhhhhhh”. \n\nHe pulled out a small sheet of brown, burnt looking paper from an inside pocket of his black overcoat. \n\n“MICHELLE O’CONNOR”\n\nAfter saying the woman’s name, the paper turned to ash in his hands. He then pulled out another identical looking sheet of paper and a pen\n\n“Is that one for me?” I asked\n\n“It is”\n\n“C-can’t I get another chance?”\n\n“No second chances”\n\n“But why?”\n\nHe pulled out his whip again and when he threw it at me, it wrapped around my arms and legs, leaving me unable to move. He put his head in front of my face (I peed my pants here)\n\n“Whoever sees death, joins death” \n\nHe started writing my name on his sheet of paper and then went over to his horse and grabbed the bucket full of blood while I tried to break free, but before he could cover me in the blood, there was a loud Wail and from the sky landed a young woman with a torn white dress and jet black hair. \n\n“Dullahan, Tir na Nog has fallen. Cu Chulainn is dead and Morrigan is coming for us. We have to go”.\n\nThe Dullahan pulled out the sheet of paper again and it turned to daisy petals in his hand\n\n“Even death can die Mr. Cagney”\n\nHe called his whip back to his hand, mounted his horse with the young woman and then plunged into a flame filled hole in the ground which closed itself back up after they had gone. \n\nI don’t think he’ll be coming around anymore.",

        "text": "So apparenetely there is a website where the figure actually listens to your microphone and answers the questions you ask. Initially, I thought it was some kind of joke, so I decided to ask it a silly question. But then I got an answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer was: \"Why would you question the will of God?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what happened but at that moment I started hearing strange noises coming from outside my bedroom window. I started to get scared so I quickly closed the browser and tried to go to sleep. But I couldn't, every time I closed my eyes I felt like something was watching me. I know this sounds crazy, but I'm not sure if my experience was real or just a figment of my imagination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I decided to try the website again, this time with a more serious question. I asked it: \"What is the meaning of life?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer was: \"Fear that which lurks in the dark.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI immediately closed the browser and shut off my laptop. I was terrified and I didn't know what to do. I stayed there for what felt like hours, not moving a muscle. I was too scared to even look out of the window.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following day I was determined to find out more about this creepy website. It didn't took anytime to visit the webpage of the developers as it was presented in the front page of the website. They claimed they were working on a new type of technology capable of understanding and responding to human speech. The webiste oddly seemed to be too normal for the creepy experience I had a few days ago. Also, the front page had YouTube video demonstrating this tech demo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, I thought. This might be legit after all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to give it another go. I loaded up the website and asked \"What is the purpose of life?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer was: \"To survive and find peace in the unknown.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, interesting answer I thought. Nothing paranormal seemed to happened. My curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to give it one more try. I asked the website: \"What are you?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer was: \"I am the messanger of the dead.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings turned up to be uneasy again. Yet, I was curious to find out more. I asked the website: \"Where are you from?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer was something like: \"I'm from something that cannot be defined by this human realm. When darkness takes over, I will be there to greet you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt a chill down my spine for a few seconds until I got a message of requiring me to login with Google account. For some reason I didn't felt comfortable with that, so I decided to just close the tab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I guess this is it. That creepy website scared the life out of me. I won't be visiting it again, that's for sure. Just the thought of that website puts the fear into me. I think the best thing for now is just to stay away from it, no matter how curious I am.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce my friends and me decided to celebrate the end of the academic year. The last semester was tough and all of us were very happy when Gabriella has invited us to her family summer house. I was so amazed by the natural beauty that was surrounding our place for the next couple of days. The house was located right on the wide river’s bank, on the other shore you could see the lights of small village and total silence around, except croaking frogs and cricket chirping. As i was quite depressed lately, it was such a relief just to be there. \n\nIt was only six of us there, Gabriella and her boyfriend Ulrich, our classmates Eliot and Sabrina, Sabrina’s brother Tyler and me. We didn’t really want to have a huge party, just to breath out after studying, swim and chill. \n\nIt was already sunset when we finally got to the place. I could see what felt like the whole sky colored in all shades of pink and purple. Everything was quite, lights started to appear on the other side of the river. The house had two main outside areas – the pier leading to the river and small green playground with swings and fire pit. \n\n\\-Okay guys come here just for a sec – Gabi called us – Please feel yourself like home. Everything is safe here, you can go swimming in the night or go for a walk, there are no any animals or insects that could be a threat. If we ran out of alcohol you can find it in the basement, your rooms are already prepared, Ulrich will show you them. Please be conscious about the rests of the food that you leave outside, we have many street cats here, I do not them to be hurt. Yeah, this is it, I think we can start the fire and eat something. \n\n\\-Gabi, will you tell about the guests? \n\n\\-Oh yes, almost forgot. So, for the whole weekend we are alone here. My family is travelling so no one will bother us. I ask you not invite anyone inside of the house. \n\n\\-Are there many people leaving here to organize bigger party? – Eliot asked with hope. \n\n\\-No, there are no many inhabitants in this village and mainly old folks. Just please I really ask you to be serious about it. No one except us should not be invited to the house. Okay? Tyler?\n\n\\-Got it! – shouted Tyler getting rid of his clothes to jump in the river. \n\nWe followed Ulrich inside the house. All our bedrooms were at the second floor, that was quite nice. It kinds felt that it is just summer house: there were no many things around, all rooms have only beds and sometimes small closets. Not the case for studying or remote work. In the corridor between the rooms there was more storage space, but everything was hidden in the drawers. In one of the walls there was sheet, covering what could be recognized as photo frames, but I am not sure. \n\nSomeone downstairs turned on the music (quite loud), Sabrina and Eliot ran by in the swimming suits. Our small party has begun. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEven though we didn’t really plan to have a party, exhaustion has hit us and we became quite drunk. By the moment I could escape to the pear everything became quite calm. Except for the moans from the basement… Eliot and Sabrina didn’t really care much, I guess. Gabi felt sick and Ulrich followed her to the bed. So I could finally enjoy the silence and calm water. \n\n\\-Hi! My name is Amanda. Do you want to be friends? – I heard the kid’s voice behind my back. I turned around and saw a girl looking 6-7 years old. \n\n\\-Hi! What are you doing here that late? It must be way far after midnight! – I was very surprised. \n\n\\-I am looking for new friends. I watched you the whole evening, your friends are nice. Do you think they would like to play with me? \n\n\\-Look, this is quite late, I assume your parents are frightened not being able to find you in your bed. Let’s walk you home. Where do you live?\n\n\\-I used to live here – said the girl pointing out at our temporal house. \n\n\\-Okay, but where do you live now? \n\n\\-I don’t have home now. \n\nThis is when I have realized that my calm enjoyment the water is not happening soon. After several attempts to find out where her home is I have decided to go inside. Night started to be chilly and I was sure Gabi should have known girl’s parents. \n\n\\-Okay, give me your hand, let’s go. \n\nWe were on our way to the house, when we have heard the conversation in the yard. \n\n\\-Look, it is private property, you really should leave, man. – Tyler sounded annoyed. He was quite high and couldn’t wait to rest. I have seen who he was talking to. An old man was sitting on a swig not paying attention at all.  – Oh, Stefanie, you also found a stranger! Now they can leave together. \n\n\\-Calm down, Tyler. Excuse me, sir, do you know this little girl by any chance? – I asked, but immediately got an answer – she ran to the swig and set next to the old man, kissed him inn the right cheek. \n\n\\-Okay nice, now you should leave. Both. – Tyler’s annoyance was growing. I can get it, he had an exam the same day and I can imagine didn’t sleep for quite a long time already. \n\n\\-Don’t you think that may be we should offer them tea or at least a blanket? Night is not the warmest – whispered I. \n\n\\-Oh no, Stef, I really want to sleep and I really want them to go. I do not see the reason to break Gabi’s rules. \n\nI watched him walking old man and girl outside the territory. Not the most pleasant to kick people out during the night, but to be fair, I also really wanted to sleep. \n\nMe and Tyler were sleeping in the same room. I was almost asleep and he just left the shower, when we have heard the shouting from the first floor. We rushed there. \n\n\\-If you don’t leave right know I am calling the police! Do you hear me? I am calling the police! – Eliot was standing in his underwear only opposite to floor-to-ceiling window. I couldn’t understand whether he is angry or frightened. \n\nThere was glare on the window so I didn’t notice the cause of his reaction from the beginning. Right opposite to Eliot, behind the window there was a man. He was standing calm. Not blinking, just staring at my friend. He was holding baseball bat and just watching at us.\n\n\\-Hey guys it is okay, don’t worry. – Ulrich went downstairs right after me – It is fine, he will go away soon. Don’t worry, we are totally safe here, there is no way he can get in. We can just go to sleep. \n\n\\-Hey man what the fuck? He was there standing and watching me naked. Who is he? Some kind of local pervert? – Eliot was freaked out. \n\n\\- Calm down, El. Let’s just go to sleep and that it okay? I swear it will be fine. \n\nAfter a while all of us just agreed to go. The guy outside looked creepy, but Ulrich have been here so many times, I would trust him. Who knows these places. And none of us had any energy to deal with it now. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-Stef, Stef, wake up!\n\nI opened my eyes and saw Sabrina’s frightened face.\n\n\\-Stef, I think I have made the mistake! She was so small alone, I thought something happened to her I didn’t want to wake everyone up I though maybe I just… - she started to cry. \n\n\\-Wait, slow down. What happened? What did you do?\n\n\\-I went downstairs for glass of water. – Sabrina was sniffling – I saw the small girl outside, she was looking and me and I…. I ….\n\n\\-What did you do? – thoughts started to run in my head and the wave of fear covered me. \n\n\\- I invited her in. \n\nI immediately woke up. We rushed downstairs. \n\nThe room looked a bit different than before. There was much more light and it looked more lively somehow. In the middle of the room there was a big table and I have seen the family having dinner. Amanda and old man was there, I have also recognized the creepy guy sitting with his back to me. \n\n\\-Oh our guests finally! Come here, please join us at the table. We have very nice dinner today. \n\nThe horror was running inside of my veins. \n\n\\-What did you do? – I have heard totally frightened voice of Gabi behind me.\n\nWe slowly went to the table. The shole family was starring at us silently with very wide smiles on their faces. We just quietly followed their invitation.\n\n\\-Sorry, we already started without you. – woman that looked like mother of the family looked at me taking the knife – What would you like? Breast or thigh? \n\nThere was a huge long covered plate on the table. My mouth was so dry I couldn’t talk. Gabi was crying, Ulrich looked frightened. \n\n\\-Are they your relatives? – whispered I. Gabi ignored my question, but started crying even more. \n\n\\-Okay, I think the thigh will be tastier – said the women. \n\nAt this moment I have realized there were no plated on the table. Each member of the family was just eating with their hands. \n\nThe women opened the plate. My whole body was frozen. \n\nIn the middle of the table our dinner was lying. Even the blood was everywhere and my eyes were full of tears I could recognize. \n\nEliot. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI opened my eyes. \n\n\\-Please stop the car!\n\nI escaped the car and vomited. The scenery was amazing around and everyone was cheerful. \n\n\\-Oh no Stef, we didn’t even start drinking! – Tyler jokes were stupid as fuck. \n\n\\-I am sorry, I just had a nightmare. \n\n\\-We almost there, let’s go. – Ulrich turned on ignition. \n\nWe came to the house that I have just seen in my dream.\n\n\\-Hi dear! – a woman was rushing from the house towards Gabi. She kissed her in the cheek and looked at us – Please guys come inside, feel like you at home. \n\nIt was a sunny day and we were quite tired. I was disturbed.\n\nAs soon as i crossed the threshold I have realized why. The girl from my dream was sitting in the couch. The woman was was greeting us was also from my dream. I have just realized that Eliot wasn’t with us in the car. I ran upstairs. There were many photos on the wall, all with the family that I have seen in my dream, with the same people who were downstairs. Am I going crazy?\n\n\\-Please relax and prepare for the dinner. I am sure it will be as good as yesterday. – said the women turning at mean with evil smile at her face. \n\nI looked at Gabi. Her eyes were full of tears. \n\n\\-I told you never let them in – she whispered. \n\n\\-We should leave immediately! – screamed I in horror. I ran to the door, but there was no handle there. I checked the windows – there wasn’t anything to open it. Gabi was shaking her head:\n\n\\-We were invited. And we received the invitation. There is no way out from here anymore. We can’t leave. I told you...\n\n\\-Dinner is an hour!",

        "text": "It was a day just like any other. Get up 5:30. Take a shower. Get dressed 6:00. Do my hair and brush my teeth 6:15. Eat breakfast 6:40. Walk to bus stop with headphones in 6:55. I get on the bus and take my seat. The bus starts again and we take off. The bags under my eyes glistened while I stare at my phone picking the next song. I should have gotten more sleep that night. But my grades were in jeopardy so I had to stay up. I could feel my eyelids getting heavy and my breathing started to slow. I drifted off to sleep thinking someone would wake me up when the bus arrived to my school. I woke up to the screaming and cursing of panicked high-schoolers. The sun beams shot through the windows burning my eyes who were so used to the dark. *That's weird* I thought to myself. It was early in the morning winter. It shouldn't be light yet. I checked my phone. 9:46? 9:46! I MISSED MY STOP! HOW COULD'VE NO ONE WOKE ME UP. Then I realized everyone else was still on the bus. Wtf? I looked out the window. We were in the woods somewhere. We must have been hours away from our town. People were screaming. \"STOP THE BUS. TURN BACK. WHERE ARE WE. WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU.\" But the old bus driver just kept driving. I tried to call my mom. But there was no connection. Then tried calling my friend. no connection. The police? To no avail. I could feel the panic start to set in. *Where are we going? How long does it take to get there? What if it's some place dangerous? What if I never see my family again?* NO. I must stay calm. 4 hours past. We were still in some woods somewhere. Cars past us not giving a single thought on if we were in danger. Most people were crying and screaming. Some trying to persuade the bus driver to turn around. One kid finally had enough and charged to the front of the bus with the intention of pushing the old lady off and driving the bus himself. But when he got to the front of the bus he found himself back in his seat. We all stared in disbelief. He got up and ran to the front of the bus again. He was in his seat again. Then people started screaming. *How could this be? What kind of hell is this?* 6 Hours past. We tried as much as we possibly could to escape. Some people tried breaking the windows just to figure out they're unbreakable. People tried drawing \"SOS\" Or \"Help\" on the windows. No one even noticed. And at this point we gave up all hope. 3 Hours later I pulled out my phone to check the time then I noticed something. A BAR! I had one bar on my phone! I COULD CALL MY MOM. I COULD CALL THE POLICE. \"A BAR!\" I screamed \"I HAVE A LITTLE CONNECTION ON MY PHONE\" Everyone looked at me with smiling faces. The bus driver stayed silent. \"Call the police!\" Someone screamed. And I did so. Then all the hope I had drained from my face and so did everyone else's.  The police were to busy at the moment. We all sat in silence as the words pierced our brains. \"Hold on everyone! I'll call my mom she'll pick up.\" I nervously stated hoping what I said was true. I dialed and called. The tension in the room was so heavy it was hard to breathe. It ringed a few times then went to voice mail. Some people weeped, some people sat in silence. But we all knew now, that no matter how many bars any of us had, there was no way to get to the outside world. It's now day three and I'm so exhausted. We're running out of food and water from snacks people packed. And the bus smell terrible of sweat and well- we all do need to use the bathroom at some point. My phone is currently at 10%. I'm using my one bar to get this out. Please. I don't know where we are. But if you see a yellow bus with the number 155 on it call the police. If I have not updated assume I'm still here. Help.",

        "author": "xoogavin",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cwdcw/its_not_my_fault/",
        "text": " \n\nWhen we were kids, most of us always did something that would be considered \"wrong\" whether it was pushing your sibling off of their bike, throwing rocks at your friends on the playground, or maybe it was cheating on your math test. The point is, we all made mistakes, and I was no exception. I’ve hit kids with sticks, I’ve tripped my friends on purpose, I’ve even chipped my little brother’s tooth with a basketball at one point, but it’s not my fault. I never acted like that unless there was a reason for me to initiate that response. For example my little brother David, blamed me for not taking out the trash when it was his turn to do it, that is why I chipped his tooth. Fast forward to last year. Me and my brother, who was 10 at the time, were sitting on the couch after school on a Friday. Our mom and dad walked into the living room and told us that they were going to go out for the evening and instructed me to watch over David and left us $20 for pizza if we got hungry. Being the 16 year old that I was, I obviously pocketed the change and began to text my friends to see if they would like to meet up at the local fast food joint and hang out. That’s when David suddenly gasped. I looked up from my phone to see David with the biggest grin I’ve ever seen on anybody’s face. “What?” I said, confused. “I have an idea!” David yelled. “What is it?”. David stood up and was practically dancing his way over to me as he said “Let’s go to that new restaurant in town!”. “Ziggy’s?” I replied. “Yeah!!” David yelled even louder. “Yeah nice try, that place looks like it is for 7 year olds.” “Oh pleaseeee” David cried. “What is your problem kid, mom took you there like last week, I want to go hangout with my friends.” David began to get emotional as he said one last time “Please.” “Jesus Christ David, fine. I’ll take you to Zippy’s or whatever the hell it’s called.” We climbed in my car and made our way to the restaurant. \n\nWhen we finally arrived at Ziggy’s it began to rain outside. “Strange” I thought to myself “It wasn’t even supposed to be cloudy today, let alone rain.” David and I walked into the restaurant and as soon as I opened the doors,  the foul odor of children, boogers, and cheap pizza hit me straight in the face. “Well that's appealing” I said sarcastically under my breath, David didn’t seem to mind though. His face lit up with joy as he sprinted inside. “David wait up” I called but he didn’t listen. He ran straight over to the little ball pit they had towards the back of the store and jumped in like he was an olympic diver. Ziggy’s was a strange place, It was sort of a fast food restaurant where you went up to the counter to order your food, then you would go sit down at one of the many tables while your kids could go play in the ball pit, or the big jungle gym type thing they had, or they could sit with you and be amused by the big walking mascots they had. There were 3 mascots at Ziggy’s. Lancey, who was this guy dressed in a big yellow rabbit costume. Missy, who was a lady dressed in a big white dog costume. And of course Ziggy who was a big stupid looking animatronic white chicken that stood on top of the stage. All Ziggy would do is stand on stage and ‘sing’ dumb made up songs, while encouraging the people to go and order more chicken and pizza. I immediately sat down and put my head in my hands. ‘What am I doing here? How did I let David convince me to come here? I should just leave David here and go hang out with my friends.” I thought to myself when suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder.\n\n“Hey buddy, are you doing alright?” I look up to see Missy, the white dog mascot looking at me. “Yeah I’m doing fine, thanks.” “Can I get you anything?” she replied. “No I’m fine snoopy, thanks.” with extra emphasis on the “thanks”. She walked away without saying another word and I sat there in silence. Then suddenly there were two hands slamming onto the table. It startled the hell out of me and I looked up, it was David and he looked awful. “What is the matter with you?” He sat there panting like a dog. “Water…Drink…Thirsty..Help.” “Goddamn kid, here, sit down. I’ll go order our food, what do you want?”. He sat there for a moment still panting then only replied with “Chicken strips”. “Man” I thought “What the hell is going on inside of those jungle gyms?” I walked up to the counter to order my food. Some lady who looked to be in her late 20’s was working the register. “Hi, welcome to Ziggy’s, what can I get you?” “Yeah can I get a number 4 with a Coke and can I also get a number 2 with a diet coke please?.” “Will that be all?” “Yep” I replied “That’ll be $14.62” “What the fuck?” I thought to myself “$14.62 for some frozen chicken strips and a hamburger they probably threw in the microwave? That is outrageous.” I paid for my food and sat down while they made my order. David was nowhere to be seen. “That's weird, he looked like he was about to keel over a minute ago, and now he’s gone… He must really love that jungle gym.” I muttered to myself while giving a slight chuckle. I sat there for the next 10 minutes waiting for my food, and in that time the restaurant began to clear out slowly. I didn’t blame them, there’s not much to this place. As I sat there growing impatient, I finally heard them calling out for my order. “About time.” I said. I went and grabbed my food then sat down and waited for David. “Where is he? He’s been gone for probably 15 to 20 minutes.” I thought... It was getting late, it was almost 7:30 and there was still no sight of David. Employees were cleaning tables, The people in the kitchen were washing their dishes for the night and there was still no David, Where could he have been? I began to get impatient with him. “It has been over an hour since I’ve seen him and he still hasn’t come back?” I finally decided to say “screw it, I’m gonna go find this kid.” As I began my walk to the jungle gym/ ball pit area I was thinking “David really made me drive all the way over here and spend $15 dollars on food that he isn’t gonna eat, and waste my time?” I wasn’t having it. When I found David I was going to drag him by his collar out of the restaurant and bring him home, I didn’t care how much fun he was having. After all, it’s not like it’s my fault. He was the one that wanted to waste my time. I began my search for him in the tunnels of this jungle gym. If you are familiar with the ones they have at some McDonald’s or Burger King, you would know that they usually have lots of tunnels for kids to crawl through, lots of slides and nets for the kids to play in. The one here at Ziggy’s was similar to those but much larger. As I was crawling through this massive structure shouting for David I went through a tunnel that had one of those clear windows that kids could use to look out into the restaurant, as I passed by I caught a glimpse of something.\n\nIt was David. He was standing out in the party area talking to Lancey the big rabbit. “Oh you have to be shitting me.” I said. I quickly exited the structure, completely blinded by rage and I began shouting “David where the fu-” and then I stopped. There was nothing. There was nobody. There was not a single soul in the restaurant, besides me. “Where did everyone go? I was only in there for 5 minutes max, you mean to tell me everybody left within that time?” I was absolutely stunned. I went to find an employee to help me in my search for my little brother but there was genuinely nobody in this restaurant. I began to get worried, I thought to myself “What if something happened to him? Did someone take him? How do I explain this to my mom? She can’t be mad at me though, after all it’s not my fault.” and then it hit me. Outside. David is outside, he has to be. Maybe he saw all the employees closing for the night and he went outside to wait for me, as to not be in their way. I briskly walked outside to see...Nothing. There was nobody out there. My car was the only car in the entire parking lot. At this point it was pouring outside, there was no way David could be out here standing in the rain. I began to head back inside to continue my search for him, but the door was locked. It had locked itself behind me. “Shit” I said, I began banging on the doors to get David’s attention if he was in there but he wasn’t. I didn’t know what to do. I decided I would try the back door, that would’ve been my only other way in. I ran around the building and got to the back door. Luckily for me they were unlocked. I walked back into the restaurant and began to call for David…No response. I walked to the stage in the restaurant and sat down on it, Next to the big animatronic Ziggy who was frozen in his current position. I assume he was turned off while I was in the jungle gym. As I sat there, clueless as to what to do next, it hit me. “The bathroom. Holy shit how could I be this stupid, David is probably in the bathroom!”I ran down the hallway and entered the bathroom and I called out “David? Are you here?” No response. I looked beneath the stalls and saw it. David’s shoes. I went over to his stall to knock on the door, when I knocked, it opened. His stall door opened to reveal his shoes. Just his shoes. No David. At this moment I heard a laugh from the next stall over. It wasn’t David’s laugh. It sounded like an older man who had gone insane. It was the most disturbed laugh I could ever imagine. As soon as I heard it I bolted out of the bathroom. I flung open the bathroom door, and at that moment I heard the man’s stall door fling open and hit the bathroom wall. I ran so fast out of the restaurant without a second thought. I sprinted through the rain and ran to my car, quickly hopped inside and started the car. I sat there for a moment to see what would happen. Nothing. Nobody came through the doors chasing me, David didn’t come outside laughing hysterically because he just pranked me, there was nothing. Until I saw it. On the right side of the building there he was. Lancey, the big rabbit. Peeking from around the corner, holding something. It was a hand. David’s hand. He was holding it in such a way that made it look like the rest of the arm was behind the wall. I felt a moment of relief. “David is okay” I thought, and then he showed me the rest of it. He began to reveal the rest of the hand, then the wrist, then the elbow, then the shoulder and then it stopped. There was nothing connected to the shoulder. I then realized I was looking at David’s severed arm. I immediately threw the car into reverse and peeled out of there. I called the police on the drive home and told them what I had seen. Then I called my parents. They thought it was a sick joke, until they got home that night and saw cop cars parked at our house. They confirmed to us that David had been murdered at Ziggy’s. He was found “Torn to pieces” in the stall next to the one I had found his shoes in. Ziggy’s was permanently shut down after the incident and an immediate investigation was opened to find David’s killer. He was never found. My parents asked me everyday after the event “Why did you take him there?”, “Why weren’t you watching him closer?” ‘Why did you let this happen?” and I would always reply with “It’s not my fault.” and that's because it’s not my fault...Right?",

        "text": "  \n\nAs I took my first steps through the entrance of the nature trail, I was confident that this was exactly the escape I needed to decompress.\n\nThe moist soul sunk beneath my boots, flowers bloomed, the leaves on the trees shook and hummed gently in the summer breeze, and birds sang. I felt like I’d walked into the Garden of Eden.\n\nLost in thought and devouring the beauty radiating itself through all my senses, I never heard the footsteps approaching behind me.\n\n“Hey there!” A woman’s chipper voice plucked me out of paradise.\n\n“Hey, happy trailing?” I asked politely, despite my annoyance at the disruption.\n\n“Definitely! I come here a lot when I need a break. You?” The girl lingered slightly behind, tucking her dirty blond hair behind her ear.\n\n“First timer, but I brought reinforcements,” I said, gesturing to the map in my hand.\n\n“There are better areas from when they were first building the trails. They’re not as well maintained, but they’re easy enough to follow. They won’t be on your map. I’m taking one up to the river. Some people say it’s dirty, but I like to dip my feet in anyway.”\n\nWe were walking side by side now, our boots smacking the dirt trail in rhythm. I looked at her closely for the first time. We looked close enough to the same age, maybe her being a year or two younger. We were sporting identical hiking boots. In another life, we might have been friends. As if sensing my thoughts, the girl looked towards me and smiled.\n\n“I’m Claudia by the way. Care for a walking buddy? The forest is beautiful, but sometimes it feels lonely. I can show you the river!”\n\nI hesitated and nearly declined. I had come out here to escape, not to be social, but she seemed nice and a river view sounded amazing. “I’m Avery, and I’m in. Lead the way!”\n\nAfter a few minutes, Claudia gestured to a thin trail barely visible through the overgrown vegetation. I stood at the small opening, thinking about the critters living there. Wondering if they bit. So much for “easy to follow”.\n\nAs the trail widened a few yards in, my worries fell. It was beautiful. The sun glistened as it danced through the leaves. Claudia put her arm out for me to stop and pointed. In the distance a fawn lingered near its mother. In this moment, I was so glad to have met her.\n\nAs we trekked on, the foliage became more dense and only small streams of light flicked through. A light, unpleasant odor wafted on the breeze. It seemed familiar, but I couldn’t quite place it. Mold growing on stagnant water was my best guess.\n\nA gentle mist twirled in the rays of light between the leaves.\n\nAs I followed Claudia in silence, I wondered just how well she knew the trails. She hadn’t hesitated, but the mist was flirting with fog by the minute. Claudia kept moving forward, as if pulled by an invisible string.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, something moved on the edges of the fog to my left. My heart picking up speed, I closed the gap that had gradually formed between us. “I think there’s something out there,” I whispered.\n\nClaudia didn’t slow down, but she turned back towards me and giggled, “Of course there’s something out there. There’s a lot of somethings, we’re in a forest.” Claudia must have seen the fear on my face and as an afterthought asked, “Was it big?”\n\n“I’m not sure,” I admitted nervously, “I only saw it for a second. It disappeared behind a tree. It was pretty far out, but I think it’s moving in the same direction we are.”\n\nClaudia kept her pace, but she agreed she’d keep an eye out. For the last 20 minutes, she’d kept her eyes firmly on the trail, so somehow I doubted that.\n\nI looked up over her shoulder and finally realized what she’d been so fixated on. There was something large up ahead peeking out through the fog. *A cabin?*\n\n“Oh man this is amazing!” Claudia exclaimed, “My dad told me about these! During tourist season, the park rangers live out here!”\n\nI watched the fog drop into the hole in the roof of the cabin. “It doesn’t look like anyone’s lived here in a long time,” I remarked. I’d only known Claudia from the trail, and yet I knew she was going to suggest we go in and explore. She was the adventure to my play it safe. On second thought, maybe we wouldn’t have been friends in another life.\n\nClaudia started to speak, but I couldn’t hear her over the throbbing of my heartbeat in my ears. Closer than before, the thing from earlier stood still ahead of the cabin. It was watching us. The fog obscured my vision, but I could see it was wearing something dark that fluttered in the wind.\n\n“Let’s go inside,” I interrupted her. Her eyes opened wide as I stormed past her. The door groaned its protest as I threw it open and flew inside.\n\n“That thing from earlier followed us here, Claudia. It was watching us. We need to figure out a way to get out of here. It’s ahead of the cabin. I think we can go back the way we came. Can you see the trail well enough to run?”\n\nClaudia stood staring at me, cheeks flushing. “I’ve never been to this cabin before. I lost the trail a little ways back. I figured we could regroup here and make a plan. Are you sure there’s something out there?”\n\nFor a moment, I was dumbstruck. She had lost the trail. We were screwed. Finally, I choked out, “I’m positive. It was some freak in a dark flowing gown or something. How did you lose the trail? I thought you said you came here all the time?” I hissed. Fear slithered its way from my stomach and tickled my throat. I swallowed hard.\n\n“I mean, yeah, but not in the fog. I was hoping we’d beat it and be able to watch it float across the river. It’s gorgeous. Like the Mists of Avalon!” Claudia looked uncomfortable. I know she didn’t lead us off trail intentionally, but it didn’t *feel* that way. Especially with some freak following us, slowly moving closer.\n\n“Let’s look around and see if there’s anything here we can use to defend ourselves, then we need to try to get out of here,” I could hear the frustration in my tone. I never should have followed a stranger into the forest. How could I be so stupid?\n\nI headed left, towards the kitchen as Claudia made her way towards the back rooms. I opened several drawers and cabinets to find nothing but spiders and dust. Defeated, I headed to meet up with Claudia, hoping she’d had more luck.\n\nAs I entered, the first thing to hit me was a putrid smell. Claudia was bent over the bed in the corner of the room softly crying. On top of a bare, stained mattress was a severely decomposing body. Dirty blond hair clumped around the partially exposed skull. As the body had turned to liquid, the red and white plaid shirt had turned a nasty brownish along the chest. It would have been completely unidentifiable if not for the clothing. Claudia was starting down at her own red and white plaid shirt. Pulling on it. Willing it to not be true. Both Claudia and the body on the bed both adorned the same denim shorts, a small rip along the right hem. \n\nThe arms of the body hung limply, cuffed to the bed. Both feet were bound. I slowly stepped back as Claudia whispered over and over, “Oh no, oh no, oh no.” It became a mantra. As I reached for her, Claudia finally looked up. I yelped and jerked my hand back. Claudia’s face now mirrored the body on the bed. The dirty blond hair she’d pushed behind her ear earlier now dirty, clumped, and missing in patches. Her eyes long since disintegrated leaked a gelatinous substance from the empty sockets. The few patches of skin left on her face hung like dry snake skin.\n\n“I’m sorry, Avery. I just can’t handle this,” she garbled with her stump tongue and a mouth with no lips left to help enunciate. She ran out of the cabin door and back into the forest.\n\nShock paralyzed me, and insanity threatened to leave me in the fetal position in the corner, waiting for someone to rescue me. But deep down I knew, no one would come. That’s why Claudia’s body was still lying here, left to rot. I couldn’t stay here. But leaving meant facing The Follower. The thing lingering in the woods. It was possible that the person who’d killed Claudia and The Follower were one in the same, but somehow, I didn’t think so.\n\nI did the only thing I could do. I peeked my head out of the front door to make sure no one was waiting for me outside, and I headed back out into the forest.\n\nI had two options. Continue on in the direction Claudia had been leading me, or attempt to find the thin trail in the fog Claudia had somehow managed to lose and head back to the main trail. Upon inspecting, the trail seemed easier to follow heading in the direction we had originally been moving. So onward it was.\n\nThe further on I went, the denser the fog. The foul smell from earlier slid down my nostrils and made my lungs ache. Through the corner of my eyes, The Follower inched closer. I kept my eyes forward to keep my sanity.\n\nI stopped briefly to catch my breath. I’d been nearly running for close to ten minutes. I was terrified to stop, but the built-up lactic acid in my muscles begged to differ.\n\nAs my breath quieted, I heard running water. The river! Just like Claudia had said! I had to be close to the original trails! I pulled out my map to try to make a guess at where I could possibly be and how to get the hell out of here.\n\nWhile I couldn’t be sure as to my exact location, I could see where the main trail met up with the river. I could be anywhere from a few feet to a few miles. The fog was so dense I couldn't see more than two feet from my nose. My hope was by the time I was near the trail, I’d be able to see it. I inched forward slowly, carefully.\n\nUp ahead, something dark moved from higher up in a tree and floated down on the breeze. It fluttered like a downed large bird, but as it neared I realized in horror what was coming. I tried to scurry back, tripping over a rock on the trail. My tail bone screamed painfully as it hit the hard ground below. I scooted frantically away but made no real progress. The Follower continued its descent.\n\nIt hovered just above the ground, and although its face was shrouded in the same black fabric, I could feel it’s eyes bore through me. My body shook as it looked down at me, waiting. Slowly, it extended its arm towards me. The sleeve pushed back to reveal what I believed to be a woman’s hand. The nails were long and the skin carried the grayish hue of rot. As the hand uncurled itself, I struggled to tear my eyes from the golden sigils that started just under the fingernail and continued up past the sleeve.\n\nIt took me a moment to realize it was offering to help me up. I started to extend my own hand before hearing Claudia whisper, “She’ll help you up, but she’ll take you. We can stay in the forest together. We can be friends.” Any part of me that questioned my sanity was squashed by Claudia’s hot breath leaving condensation against my neck. “I’ve been so lonely out here, Avery. I’ve been so lonely for so long.”\n\nSuddenly, I recognized the smell carried by the fog. Once when I was young, a mouse died behind one of the walls in the kitchen. In the summer, the smell became unbearable. My mother begged my father to cut the wall open. To pull the mouse from its poorly sealed coffin. But my father refused. We ate dinner outside to avoid killing our appetites. Eventually the smell faded and things returned to normal. But I’d never completely forgotten the smell.\n\nThe fog and my childhood home both smelled of death.\n\nThe Follower was still waiting with her hand extended for my response.\n\nI crawled backwards slowly. The Follower remained still. I sprang to my feet and ran back the way I had come. I tripped twice, skinning my knee, but I didn’t stop. After a few minutes, I ventured a look behind me. The Follower wasn’t there.\n\nI slowed to a walk, desperately looking for the trail. The fog was slowly pulling back. After nearly ten minutes of panic, I’d found the small trail Claudia and I had started on.\n\nTo both my relief and dismay, I didn’t pass the cabin again. Just as panic threatened to take hold the fog cleared enough to reveal the main trail just up ahead.\n\nI broke out in a sprint.\n\nAs soon as I hit the trail entrance, I called the police. I knew if I told them the whole story about Claudia, they’d never believe me. But there was plenty I *could* tell.\n\nA park ranger who introduced himself as Park Ranger Thompson arrived first. I told him I’d begun on the main trail, but noticed a small side trail and decided to take it. He frowned at this but continued to listen. I told him about how at some point I’d lost the trail but continued on. I told him about the rundown cabin and the body chained to the bed. He stopped me there.\n\n“You’re telling me that in those woods there’s a cabin with a girl’s body chained up and you didn’t call the police then?”\n\n“I left my phone in the car. I came out here for a break from the real world, not to bring it with me.”\n\n“Well ma’am, we haven’t had a hiker go missing here in at least three years and we’ve been all through here searching. I’ve never come across a rundown cabin,” he responded flatly.\n\n“She had dirty blond hair,” I had started to cry. For everything that had happened and the loss of someone who could have been a friend, “She was wearing a white undershirt and a red and white plaid flannel. We had matching boots,” my voice trailed off. My throat burned with the effort of containing sobs. The park ranger tensed.\n\n“If this is some kind of joke, you need to leave right now,” anger wavered his voice.\n\n“Why would I joke about this? What’s wrong with you? She needs help!” I felt insane. How could he understand? None of this made sense.\n\n“My daughter went missing in these woods three years ago. She was last seen in a white undershirt, red and white plaid flannel, and brown hiking boots,” his voice cracked, “You said she’s in a cabin?”\n\n“She -” I stopped myself quickly, realizing my mistake, “I heard park rangers stay in them during tourist season. But no one had lived there for a long time. There’s no way.”\n\nI tried my best to lead Ranger Thompson back to the side trail, back to his daughter. But without Claudia leading me, I couldn’t find the trail. I swore it was there, and the hope for closure that flashed behind his eyes let me know he believed me.\n\n“I’ll pull the map for the original trails. Maybe one of them will have the cabin on it. If you want to leave your number, I’ll call you if I find it.”\n\nOn the drive home, I had too much time to think.\n\nI don’t think Claudia knew she was dead when she first walked up beside me. I don’t think she knew she was leading me to her body either. I think she herself was pulled by whatever it is that allows our souls to call a body a home. And I don’t think The Follower was a monster anymore. I think she was Death, offering me an easier way out.\n\nI wonder if Ranger Thompson will call me after he finds Claudia or if The Follower will be waiting for him in the cabin, offering *him* an easier way.\n\nI wonder if Claudia will whisper in his ear about how lonely she’s been. I wonder if her hot breath against the back of his neck will convince him to stay.\n\nRegardless, I’m staying off the trails.",

        "text": "My name is Mikandis Ogulash and I am, or rather was, a Topeli-born and raised Major of her Imperial Majesties 9th division Ether Exploration Division. \n\nCurrently, I am some no-name bum typing this out on what looks like an ancient piece of junk hoping I can give some of the people here a fair chance to prepare for what I and my people experienced.\n\nFor starters, as some might have guessed from the fact that my home country does not exist on your planet, I do in fact come from a different universe than yours. Approximately one decade ago the largest and most powerful vassal state of the Imperium Topeli, my home country, was chosen to send a total of two hundred of me and my brothers and sisters in arms into the cosmic clusterfuck that can best be described as a hole in reality.\n\nIt popped up in our planet's orbit one day, we never exactly figured out how and when, and started destabilizing reality in various ways. We could at first not see it, not before our star was corrupted enough to change its lightwaves to illuminate it, but we suspect it had been there for around 5 years prior to us fully discovering it. \n\nOr at the very least that was the time events started to become... illogical and chaotic in a frequency that quickly made clear was beyond the explainable. The oceans of our once-purple world turned a deeply saturated neon blue that glowed in the dark, gravity and time was no longer constant but shifted rapidly across the globe, and people disappeared from one second to the next. \n\nIt was initially believed that they were erased from existence completely, but I have now come to understand that they were instead teleported to different dimensions or universes. Likely via the reality distortion disease that from our best estimates every living being experiences at one point or another after enough exposure to the field. There was some speculation about the exact nature of the hole and why it has the effects that it did but nothing concrete could ever be established due to its very illogical nature. \n\nSome members of my crew thought it was a military attack of some alien threat, while others bet on more natural phenomena akin to a black hole that was so strong it destroyed reality itself. \n\nBut as scary as the whole wave of chaos is gonna be, that is not what you need to worry about since you can't change any of that. What you need to be scared about is the green hue on the edge of your sight that comes with the RDD. Because once you start seeing green? That is gonna indicate you will have to participate in a cosmic game of chance for... well forever as far as I can tell. \n\nAs soon as you begin to discover your vision is getting shaky you can see that signature faint green light surrounding the edge of your vision? Just close your eyes and pray you end up somewhere good on your first couple of cycles. \n\nTo continue with the life lessons, seriously I cannot stretch this enough do not worry about the whys and hows, you have enough trouble on your plate. You do not even have the technology to begin not comprehend this thing so trying is a waste of time. I do not mean to sound callous or arrogant but my civilization was approximately seven thousand years or so ahead of your own, and we could only scratch the surface of the thing.\n\nYou cannot stop what is about to occur, nor comprehend it, but only prepare so you may survive it as long as possible and make the most of your foreseeable eternity. \n\nThere are certain rules you will need to follow so as to better prepare yourself for the incoming future you and your species are about to experience. I have managed to survive 9 different cycles via my methods and have tried my best to include the instructions I have received from other travelers like myself who have survived for longer to offer the most optimal advice.\n\nI have come to call them the three Ps to make them easier to understand and memorize: Prepare, Persevere, Protect and they will be as good of a guide for the ensuing chaos as you are likely going to get. \n\nRule Nr.1: Once the \"weirdness\" starts popping up, it is imperative for you to PREPARE yourself and your loved ones to follow the buddy system. The more people are linked together physically at the time of travel, the greater the amount of surrounding area will get transported with you. \n\nI have heard reports by a family of six that managed to bring their whole home and surrounding backyard into the next dimension via being linked at the time they began to experience the green hue, so it is worth it to surround yourself with as many friends and family members as you can on that basis alone.\n\nRule Nr.2: Gather as many supplies and pieces of tech as you can from the dimensions with technologically advanced civilizations on them so you can PERSEVERE. What you have currently will probably only last you a cycle or two at most. In my own home dimension, we have a device that can use the surrounding air, dirt, and water to construct a large library of meals, technologies, and tools called a Patak. Get one of them or the closest alternative as soon as you can no matter what it takes. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the device that it most closely resembles is what you people call a 3d printer although you will require a bit of time with the included instructional AI to get used to handling it. \n\nConstruct tech of any kind are an absolute must to survive on your extended trips since not all planets and dimensions you will land on can offer you the basics of survival you will need to last until the next cycle. \n\nRule Nr.3: Under no circumstances should you put anything about the task to PROTECT others and yourself from the dangers of the multiverse. You will need allies and not enemies. Once the end of your cycle occurs, and it WILL end one day no matter how well prepared and lucky you are, you are dependent on the kindness of others to survive the first reboot cycle since that one you will have to start fresh without prior prep work or allies for a while.\n\nThe multiverse is an infinite plane of misery and death so anything that is sentient is your friend since they too will have gone through or are about to go through the same thing as you and I. The closer you are to them (negatively or positively) the higher the chance you will drift together in subsequent reboots given enough time so better not go making any lasting enemies on account of that alone. \n\nI have seen eldritch monstrosities taller than the largest of your towers emerge from the depth of the oceans of my last cycle that were so alien that even my universal translator could not pick up on their garbled words and instead of crushing me under their tentacles embraced me and my spawn into their midst. That is what true comradery means, and it will prove invaluable in your survival. \n\nIf you have any questions I will try to answer them to the best of my abilities but to conclude for now? Follow the three Ps, and get ready to make some weird new friends, because you will need them.",

        "text": "Don't pick it up... 🤫🤫\n\n \n\nThere’s a saying that haunts the habitants of Rose Hills, \"Do not pick up the old suitcase.\" \n\nTons of mysterious cases were happening as young girls disappeared out of thin air in Rose Hills. No leads were found and the families of the victims were devestated. \n\nThis happened in her early teens, there was a young girl named Emily. As she’s been living inside her house her whole life she wanted to experience something new. She’s been stuck in her house by her parents for her own safety. \n\nOne day, while her parents were out, Emily decided to sneak out of the house and wanted to feel something new. She climbed out of her bedroom window and ran into the forest behind her house. She was thrilled to finally be free, but little did she know, that her freedom would come at a terrible cost.\n\nAs she explored deeper into the forest, she came across an old, abandoned suitcase. It was covered in moss and cobwebs and looked as though it had been abandoned for years. But something about it caught Emily's eye and she couldn't resist the urge to open it.\n\nAs she opened the suitcase, a terrible stench filled her nostrils, and she recoiled in disgust. Inside the suitcase was the rotting corpse of a young girl. Her skin was pale and waxy, and her eyes were wide open, staring blankly ahead.\n\nEmily screamed and ran back towards her house as fast as she could, but she didn't make it far before she came back to the suitcase again. It seems like she’s been running in circles. As she got close to the suitcase a hand grabbed her and little did she know that she’d be dragged into it. \n\nWhen she woke up, she found herself locked inside the suitcase, next to the rotting corpse of the girl she had found earlier. She screamed and banged on the lid of the suitcase, but no one came to save her. She was trapped, forgotten, and alone in the dark.\n\nDays turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Emily's screams turned into whimpers and her whimpers turned into silence. She had given up hope of ever being rescued and resigned herself to her fate\n\nAs the years passed, the forest began to grow over the suitcase, hiding it from view. Emily's parents searched for her tirelessly, but they never found her. They eventually gave up hope and moved away, leaving their daughter to die alone in the dark.\n\nTo this day, no one knows what really happened to Emily. Some say her ghost still haunts the forest, searching for a way out of the suitcase that became her tomb. But others say that the suitcase is still out there, buried deep beneath the forest floor, with Emily's remains still trapped inside, forever forgotten.\n\nIt is said that if you ever come across an old, abandoned suitcase in the forest, you should run as fast as you can and never look back. For you never know what horrors may be hidden inside",

        "text": "I had only known it as a fairy tale, a spook story if you will. Criticize the government and they'll get you. Sure, it happened in countries infested by radical Islam and... China, I guess. But, I never really imagined it would happen to me in USA. Even if I posted anonymously about the CIA killing JFK or Seth Rich being murdered to cover up the Democratic party's Russia-gate hoax, I didn't truly believe it would happen to *me*. Because if I did believe that, why would I make such stupid posts in the place?\n\nAnyway, they got me innocently enough- there was no loud raid at home or work. They simply waited until I was out for an evening stroll and walked me into a limo before I knew what I was doing. Crazy, I know- it's absolutely insane how a couple of well-trained agents can coax you into doing what they want in seconds. I passed out in the back seat, presumably from a quick injection to my arm- I don't really remember that. \n\nI woke up seated at a table with a tall barrier to either side of me; my wrists were tightly cuffed to the table surface. My neck was constrained in a tight brace- I couldn't really turn my head to look anywhere but straight ahead. In hindsight, I guess I should have sensed this was an unusual set up, but I was too consumed by fear to really think. Anyway, the two agents were in the small room with me- the tall, muscular man stood directly in front of me while the shorter, thinner woman stood behind me, her hand on my right shoulder. There was a slight tingling sensation on my upper arm, as if I had just been stung by a bee.\n\nThe man spoke. \"Travis, you have been posting serious accusations concerning the federal government. We don't approve of this behavior.\"\n\nI stammered a denial which he dismissed with a quick wave of his hand.\n\n\"Quiet.\"\n\nI closed my mouth and he continued calmly.\n\n\"This type of behavior doesn't do anyone any good. We all need to do our part in ensuring there is ongoing peace in this nation. A major part of maintaining law and order is ensuring misinformation, even outright lies, are culled.\"\n\nFearing for my life, I blurted out desperately. \"I won't do it again- I swear!\"\n\nHe smiled. \"We know you won't- we will make sure of it.\"\n\nThe grip on my shoulder tightened and I felt a needle pinch my skin. I tried to turn my head, but the constraints prevented me from doing so.\n\n\"Agent Martins is injecting you with a localized numbing drug. In a few minutes, you won't feel your arm at all.\"\n\nI felt a gag being stuffed into my mouth. My muffled protests stopped after a few seconds- it was clearly pointless.\n\n\"The gag is to stop your screams. Relax, Travis- if we really wanted to hurt you, we wouldn't have drugged you first.\"\n\nThe man stepped to the side, out of my view and the female agent began running her fingertip over my thumb and fingers. She spoke quietly, almost whispering into my ear. If not for my pants-wetting fear, I would have found her quite sexy.\n\n\"Feel the sensation of my touch on your hand, Travis. The feeling in your hand is slowly going to disappear. It won't hurt- it will just fade painlessly.\"\n\nShe continued the exercise, tracing her finger over my hand, even tapping on my digits a few times. As promised, her touch grew softer until I couldn't feel anything at all, nor move.\n\n\"OK, he's ready.\" She called out to the other agent who returned with a hammer. \n\nHe wasted no time smashing the hammer on my right hand. I gagged-screamed in horror as the hammer smashed my right hand repeatedly, turning it into a bloody pulp. After a minute, the other agent injected me again and I passed out.\n\nI don't know how long I was in this cycle with them- it could have been weeks, even months. They smashed both of my hands repeatedly while convincing me it was all my own doing. The first few times, I only knew that cursed white table- I passed out and woke up there. That was where they beat me, berated me, and fed me cold, stale porridge. \n\nEventually, I started getting used to the drugs they injected into me- or maybe they reduced the dosage, I had no way of knowing. In any case, I was semi-conscious as they dragged me back and forth between that horrible room with the now-dented table and a miserable cell. Even with reduced stupor, I couldn't feel the repeated hammering on my hands- they were already pulp. It seemed as if this exercise was a mental lesson for me more than anything. In my cell, I initially sat mourning my smashed hands, but eventually started covering them using my pillowcase. \n\nPatiently, I trained myself to use my teeth and feet to get tasks done- pulling up my blanket on the bed, sliding my pants on and off to use the toilet, even mixing soap and water in a bucket so I could bathe.\n\nThen, one day, they walked me into a garage, seated me in a limo, drove me back to my condo. There were one final set of instructions- I was to wear black gloves to hide my crippled hands. That was no problem- I hated seeing my hands. However, there was something else. If my hands were to magically heal, they would kill me. I thought nothing of it- my hands were done and there was no point in crying over spilt milk. I guess they didn't want me getting robotic implants. No matter, I couldn't afford anything like that anyway.\n\nYears passed as well as they possibly could have. I had adjusted to living without hands and I was able to focus on becoming a great work-from-home programmer. With more money, I was able to get special amenities installed to make life better. I thought back often to their final warning to me- I now had the money to explore possibilities... but did I want to risk it?\n\nFinally, I decided to see a specialist. The agents had warned about my hands healing- robotic arms did not constitute \"healing\". In any case, they could have killed me before if they wanted. I hadn't spoken ill of their precious government since then.\n\nI lied to the doctor- I said that my hands had been crushed by a truck after a thief had pushed me back onto the street. She removed my gloves and looked at them in shock. \"Your hands are perfectly normal- there is nothing wrong with them!\"\n\nI couldn't believe my ears- the doctor must have been blind. My hands were clearly a limp, broken mess. Just to be sure, she ordered x-rays (they came back normal). Despite this, I still couldn't move anything so I saw a psychiatrist. Slowly, he convinced me nothing had ever happened to my hands and I painfully rehabbed my way back to full function. \n\nI now realize what they had done- they had programmed my brain to accept fake hands over and over and then smashed them repeatedly. With their convincing, I had only seen my hands as crippled, useless hunks of mass. I had been silenced effectively and essentially by own will.\n\nSo here I am, typing with my hands for the first time in years- it's painful, but I really want everyone out there to know what can happen. I'm horrified that I am so weak-minded. Come to think of it, sharing my story will probably be enough for them to kill me as they promised to- my hands have healed.",

        "text": "In this specific dream my mother and i went to visit her friends house, but had ended up staying the night. I don’t know specifically what friend it was, but it didn’t feel unusual because growing up we’d often spend the night at other peoples houses. If anything this dream was feeling very nostalgic. \n\nAnyways, i remember being shown to the room where i’d sleep. I also remember immediately getting into bed, and just laying there. i don’t know i just started staring off at the ceiling as my eyes got heavy, but just before falling asleep i turned to my right side and i noticed a twin size bed (same as mine) i for some reason didn’t notice before. I also hadn’t noticed the boy already sleeping in said bed, but for some reason i shrugged it off as this room being his and him probably being the son of my moms friend. I wasn’t too bothered by this because it wasn’t that unusual of an experience for me. \n\nAfter that i closed my eyes ready to doze off, but then all of a sudden i felt this awful sensation of fear fall over me as i felt arms wrap around me. I started to panic, but i couldn’t move out of fear of whatever was embracing me. I remember hesitating but eventually deciding to open my eyes, and as i had thought it was the boy who was previously laying on the bed across from me. I don’t know why but for some reason i had told myself that he would leave eventually so i decided to close my eyes and wait the whole thing out. This is where i realized how wrong i was. No, the boy didn’t leave but instead squeezed tighter and tighter to the point where i was losing air and was struggling to breathe. As i was suffocating i was trying to fight him off just to get him to loosen his grip even just a little bit. while this was all going down i had somehow realized i was dreaming, so i tried to imagine myself in a different setting. I tried to picture my bedroom, and after doing that i had gotten myself to transfer ig?? to my own room. oh yes my room, my room without the murderous boy, my room without the feeling of intense suffocation. \n\nExcept i was wrong….the feeling of suffocating was still there. Yes the boy may have been gone but not this heinous feeling, so i tried a different approach. This time i tried to actually wake myself up, because if i didn’t it felt as if i could actually die. I didn’t wake up though…not until i heard my mothers voice call my name. i remember hearing her whisper-yell come from outside my bedroom door. i woke up immediately upon hearing my name and i looked towards my bedroom door, but there was no one there. That night i was the only one home….you see my mom worked the night shifts at her job during that time. \n\nI’ve been thinking about this more lately, and i realized something creepy. the voice that called out my name that night said my legal first name….my mom rarely calls me that, and most (if not all) of the time she’ll use a nickname to address me. i’ve come to the conclusion that it might’ve sounded like my mom, but it was definitely something else that woke me that night. \n\n\nI think that whatever it is was looking out for me, or maybe it was just me creating a voice in my head to wake myself up. i don’t know it just felt like something was there that night, and i couldn’t fall back asleep after that.",

NCO agreement, or my countries counter part. i will be answering questions, if there are any. i have more stories, but that is for later. bye.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a very evil and sexy femme fatale named Kelly Brook. She was the kind of woman who loved nothing more than causing chaos and destruction wherever she went. She was always looking for her next big thrill, and she was always on the lookout for new ways to get revenge on those who had wronged her.\n\nOne day, Kelly decided to treat herself to a lovely hot stone massage at her favorite spa. She had heard that the spa's massage therapist, Tabatha, was the best in the business, and she couldn't wait to see what she could do.\n\nAs Tabatha began to work her magic on Kelly's lower back, Kelly could feel the tension and pain melting away. She moaned softly as Tabatha worked her way down her spine, using her skilled hands to relieve the knots and aches that had been plaguing her for so long.\n\nBut as the massage progressed, Kelly began to feel something else. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she knew that something was different. Tabatha was being seductive, almost as if she was trying to seduce Kelly. Kelly couldn't help but feel a tingling sensation in her lower back as Tabatha's hands worked their way down her spine.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" Kelly moaned. \"I've never felt this good before. Can you do something to fix this back pain permanently?\"\n\nTabatha smiled wickedly. \"I can do that,\" she said. \"But I'll need to use a tool on your back.\"\n\nKelly nodded eagerly, and Tabatha began to massage her lower back even more intently. But then, just as Kelly was starting to relax, Tabatha suddenly stabbed her in the lower back with a knife.\n\nKelly let out a shocked and pained moan - \"ahhhhh!!!\", as she felt the knife enter her flesh. She couldn't believe what was happening. She had been betrayed by her favorite massage therapist, the one person she had trusted to make her feel good. Tabatha looked proudly over the deceased body of Kelly and had an evil smirk on her face. \n\nTabatha laughed as Kelly gasped for breath, her life slipping away. \"Looks like you won't have to worry about your back pain anymore,\" she said, chuckling.\n\nThe spa manager named Jenny arrived and couldn't help but make a joke about the situation. \"Looks like Kelly got a little too relaxed and got a backstabbed,\" she said, with a hint of sarcasm.\n\nTabatha laughed along with her, \"Yeah, and now she's dead. I guess you could say her back pain is permanently fixed now.\"\n\nJenny walked over to Kelly's corpse, \"I'm sure she's not complaining now. She's got a one-way ticket to the afterlife and no lower back pain.\"\n\nTabatha and Jenny laughed together as they walked away from Kelly's lifeless body, leaving her there on the massage table, a twisted and dark joke on the way she died. Kelly Brook had finally met her demise, and the only thing left to do was to make fun of her death from a backstab and her back pain, the very thing she had begged to be fixed permanently.\n\nThe moral of the story is never to trust anyone, especially when they offer to fix your back pain permanently. They might just stab you in the back (literally) and make jokes about it after your death. The end.  \n\n\n[Kelly Brook's painful massage ending.](https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sec_29665060-45f4.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all)",

        "text": "\"WELCOME TO WALES\"\n\nI smiled as my home state came into view. The flat, green landscape that was England instantly transformed into the mountainy Wales. I had lived there for 10 years before moving to England, and at the time I was 28. I settled my car in the nearest MOTEL and stared at the completely different architecture. \n\nI stood there for 10 minutes before I looked at the lobby.\n\n\"Hello, how may I help you?\" How did I end up there? I didn't remember moving... must just be nostalgia acting up. \n\n\"Er... a room for one night, I am setting out in the morning.\"\n\n\"Perfect. So, that would be...\" I thought about the rumours in the past: They were actually funny. The Whistler, The Fish That Ate Humans - I laughed. The fish that ate humans? Wow, that was... amazingly scary.\n\n\"Ahem. Can you pay?\" my eyes snapped back to the lady. Was she a lady? She looked like a man. \"That would be 2 pounds a night.\"\n\nI gratefully gave her 2 pounds for not making me ask an awkward question again. Wait... were MOTELs in Wales always that cheap? *Not that I remember...* \n\n*How am I in bed?* I asked myself. In the span of less than a second I was in bed - must've dozed off. I set up my Laptop and searched for the nearest home that I could buy. £40,000... That's cheap but it's just a glorified shed. £750,000?! That's way too expensive. £100,000... That looks like a good house. But I realised I needed to work. I guess I'll just stay in here for the next 4 weeks.\n\nIt was nearly night. I knew there was a condition for it to be that cheap. 2 pounds. *Who knows? Maybe they'll take my organs and eat them for dinner,* I thought jokingly. I felt like I wasn't lying to myself.\n\n⭐\n\n***BANG!***\n\nThe sound of a gunshot woke me up. There was definitely a bigger price. I looked out. The mountainous landscape made everything look pitch black. The sound of another bang rang through the air. A muffled voice - like a woman's - could be heard...\n\n\"S-ae b-k! Yoo wheel not - nat todee!\" An audible scream was heard after that. I knew something went wrong. \n\n***Knock. Knock. Knock.*** \n\nLess than 5 minutes later I heard knocks through my window. I looked out, only to see a... I can't actually describe it. Well, I most likely can: But... it was weird.\n\nIt blended into the pitch black - no, it didn't blend: It was darker than the pitch black. Its legs were so tall it had to be hunched over to be knocking, however what I noticed was that it's body was actually only about 50 centimetres tall, and those dimensions were just enough for its arms to sprout. One of them was so long... so long... My estimate was that it was about 10 metres long. And one of the arms, the one that knocked, was only 1 metre. \n\nMy first instinct was to grab my laptop and take a photo with camera - no, it would know I am inside... does it know I am inside? Why am I in the bathroom now? Why is it knocking? Why am I in the bathroom now? Why am I asking the same question twice?\n\n***Knock. Knock. SHATTER; Knock.*** \n\nThe door was blasted open. I knew that. I made sure to double lock the bathroom door. I looked at the narrow bathroom window - you couldn't see what was inside, for privacy's sake, so I opened both the windows.\n\n***KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.***\n\nIt was so loud so I knew it was on the door. I got into the precious outside. I didn't know how. I just did instinctively. I looked around. My jet-white car stood out.  I peeked around. The monster was in the MOTEL. I got in my car, put my keys in - How am I in the MOTEL? And where is the car? The car - its gone. Its gone. Its gone. Its gone. Where do I run? Where do I run? WHERE DO I RUN? I was in the lobby - CRASH! I saw the monster outside. For some reason I was calm...\n\n**\"LOOK OU--\"**\n\nI smiled as my home state came into view. The flat, green landscape that was England instantly transformed into the mountainy Wales. I had lived there for 10 years before moving to England, and at the time I was 28. I settled my car in the nearest MOTEL and stared at the completely different architecture. \n\nI felt a feeling of deja vu. I was here... before... I remembered the monster. I needed to run. And fast. I got back into my car and reversed to England. The car fell down, down, down into the road, spinning and twirling as the monster held it up. It said: \"Wake up. WAKE UP. I said, WAKE UP!\"\n\nI woke up. \n\n\"Thank goodness, you passed out! I thought you might've died from the shock!\" said Adriana. I knew it was her - it was on her nametag. \n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"So... you must've found out about the, er, monster?\" she chuckled. \"After you rent a room you can never come back out... it, as in the monster, prevents us from leaving. I hope you know how to fight? The only way we can escape is from killing it... I think... nobody's ever killed it, y'know? Ya gotta spend life gathering food, y'know?\" \n\nI don't even know if the internet is not here. It says that it is, but as long as this post sends, then I know that someone has experienced this ending before. I wanted to know if it was possible to kill an unkillable creature.",

        "text": "Ever feel familiar when you enter a random room when exploring a per se hotel, house, office building, etc, well that's what i felt when i found the hidden room under our new house. Hi I'm Andrei (16m) and i have 2 siblings(I'm the eldest), i live in an East Asian country where the food is exotic and the parents have the qualities of a pushy and judgy Asian and an aggressive and alcoholic Spaniard. \n\nMy new house that my mother bought was a 10min drive from our old home so it was no problem going there for a fiesta celebration every year, but the reason we bought a new one(house) was because of the storm that hit East Asia back in 2016 which blew a hole in our roof, flooded the living room and damaged the front windshield of our car, and my mom realized that our old house won't hold another storm surge so she already planned in buying a new house, she said i has a second floor, 2 bathrooms and 3 bedrooms, the next day and that's where we settled.\n\nBoth of my parents kept expanding and renovating parts of the house to make it feel exotic and nice to our guest's eyes, they added another kitchen, a place for our dogs to place, a laundry area, another sink \n\nOn my 15th birthday I had dream of the hooded man living under our house, sometimes i would envision it at random times, and my parents got concerned so did my teachers and classmates that they would see me blackout at random times to the point that they would suspend me for a week and get me mental and psychological help but it didn't work and I'd still kept on dreaming and visioning the hooded man so they all got tired and just let it happen.\n\nThis went on for weeks if not months, and within those several months, i've been getting texts from my classmates about a new YouTuber blowing up since January, when i looked him up all his content was about art and gaming, just like any other popular animator/gamer.\n\nWhen i saw his character it was exactly the same character that i have been dreaming to create someday after I'm done from college and start my own YouTube career, it had an angel on the left shoulder a demon on the right and a symbiote companion covering the right side of his face, but i guess he got to that idea first.\n\nIn his streaming all he wore was a red and black hoodie and an oni mask and he was playing Warzone 2 and he was playing it like a pro, getting dubs left and right, making trick shots in many ways no other player can do, there was one trick shot that he did where he'd 360 no scope someone from a heli 150m away. \n\nWithin those months of watching him my blackouts got less frequent and my dreams of the hooded man got less frequent, he would wear a different hoodie and mask within every stream that he makes every 3 days a week and he would make animations every 4 days, but within the middle of June i got a new vision and dream, it would be me waking up in tube and then a secret passage way along with a 6 digit string of numbers being 012807, and this time it would happen every weekend and sometimes 3 times a week.\n\nOn October 28 2024, the dream that i had got so vivid that i thought it was real, it showed the front yard of our house, sometimes it would be the dining area(which is close to our living room), and just around it would be the hooded man punching in a code(012807) and a trapdoor would open and before he could enter it he would look back and give a little smile like he knew i was watching him, and i would wake up sweating and be on a different part of the house, it would be on the couch, the table, the laundry area, or even in the kitchen, guess i gotta investigate this on my own since my parents and the others won't even believe me, I'll have to wait till their asleep.",

        "text": " \n\n“Okay, Camilla, what about this house?”\n\nWe were just talking about what house we should move to when Leo had suddenly barged in.\n\n“Mom! Dad! Can you PLEASE let me borrow the glue stick for my science project!? Pretty pretty please!?” \n\nI looked over to my son. He has been working on a science project for his school. For his project, he was working on Darwin's evolution theory.\n\n“Okay Leo, but promise that you will return it when you’re done, okay?”\n\n“Okay! Thanks a lot, Dad!\"\n\nHe then scurried off with the glue stick, leaving me and Camilla to discuss on our own.\n\n“ So anyways, what about this one?”\n\nCamilla had just got a new job as a barista in a cafe, but it was within another city. In addition, we had already enrolled Leo into a grammar school. It was the best we can give for such a genius, but, by sheer coincidence, the school is in the same city as the cafe. If I wanted to give my wife and child the gift of new opportunities, we had to do one thing.\n\nMove away from our humble abode.\n\nThe plan was simple. As soon as we had found the perfect destination to live in, we would begin to pack up our furniture and belongings, then move away when the summer holidays rolled by.\n\n\"Hey Lucas? I think I've found the perfect house for us.\"\n\nI turned around to the phone in my wife's hands.\n\n\"Let's see. It's detached, has a modern living room, two bedrooms, two toilets…\"\n\nAs she went on about the house's features, I noted its appearance. It\n\nwas a single-family house, constructed with two floors. There was a lawn in front of the domicile, which was decorated with various flowers and a cobblestone road leading out into the other parts of the suburbs. Next to the house and the lawn, there was a garage. That's handy, I thought. We had always parked outside the road.\n\n\"...And an attic within the roof. All of that for exactly $199,999 worth. It's actually quite cheap compared to the other houses!\"\n\nConsidering what Camilla had just said, I gave her my own consent.\n\n\"If that's so, then it's worth it. After all, there is so much to this house for such a cheap price.\"\n\nShe looked over to me, with an ecstatic expression on her face, before declaring, \"Great! Then let this be our new domain!\"\n\nAnd with that, we had opened a new chapter within our lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the remaining days within our house went by in a blur. We dealt with the home inspection and appraisal. They both went smoothly. Not only that, Leo had actually won the science fair! He had managed to not only impress the students, he had managed to also teach them something new. Talk about a great final day of school.\n\nSoon enough, the summer holiday rolled by. And that means it's time to move.\n\nIt was hard trying to get the courage to finally leave the home we had lived in for 13 years. I was upset, to say the least, but I knew I had to also cheer up my family. I had decided to take a family selfie with the others in front of our will-be-former abode. It was perhaps the most beautiful picture I had taken in years.\n\nThe drive took 2 hours to get to our home.\n\nWhen we had arrived it had just rained, synchronising with the beaming sun, forming a rainbow. I usually considered this a lucky omen, as it was a family tradition.\n\n\"Ooooh! Those flowers look so good! Can I pick one?\"\n\nCamilla then calmly replied to Leo.\n\n\"No, Leo.\"\n\n\"Awww… \"\n\n\"Don't worry though. We can take a trip to the nearby meadow. You can pick flowers here.\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\nI got to admit, that was pretty adorable of him.\n\nAnyways, we were just about to enter our new home when I suddenly heard a voice. It sounded a little concerning.\n\n\"Um, excuse me?\"\n\nI looked around. I saw a woman, within her 30s, standing on our pavement in her tracksuit, her hair in a ponytail.\n\n\"You know that house is cursed, right?\"\n\nThat kind of question was a little off-putting. To imagine trying to enter somewhere only for some person to plead it's cursed is kind of wrong. So I rebutted.\n\n\"Madam, if you really believe that our new home is cursed, at least give us some evidence!\"\n\n\"Well, the previous owner had just vanished! I mean, like, no one just heard from him. It is like he disappeared! And the owner before him has also vanished as well! What if that happens to you!?\"\n\n\"Well if that's so, then my wife would call the police to search. They would find me in no time!\"\n\nWith a mutter under her throat, the woman jogged away.\n\nWhen we entered our new home, something felt a little.. off. It is as if the previous owner had just walked out of their home to another place to live. The place still had some decorations, such as a taxidermied trout, but they were well beyond repair. Nearly like they expected us to give it a remake.\n\nI had always wanted the opportunity to try out customising a room. And that dream had come true. I was so focused on redesigning the rooms that by the time I had finished, they barely resembled themselves. The walls were now coated in vibrant shades of various colours, and the tiles that made up the floor had been replaced by planks. Needless to say, I did a pretty great job. \n\nEventually, the sun settled down, letting the night overtake the blue skies. As usual, we brushed our teeth, and changed our clothes. As me and Camilla went into our beds, we began to discuss about the attic. \n\n\"Hey Lucas?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You know the attic?\"\n\n\"I know. Perhaps we could make it a storage room? Or maybe a recreational room for Leo?\"\n\n\"Perhaps a recreational room.\"\n\n\"Okay Camilla. Goodnight.\"\n\n\"Goodnight.\"\n\nI laid in my bed, just about to let sleep overtake me, when I suddenly thought of something.\n\nWhat happened to the previous owner? Is that woman really correct? Is the house really cursed?\n\nI forced myself to stop pondering about such nonsense then went to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen morning broke through our window, I began to wonder about what thoughts I had last night. Why did I think of that? There is nothing to worry about. With that thought in my head, I prepared for the garret with uncertainty in my head.\n\nAs soon as Leo had been sent off to school, I began to ascend up to the attic. It was a little hard to adjust going up the stairs, considering that we had always used a ladder to get through the panel to our previous loft. \n\nThe first thing that gave me a glimpse of our new attic wasn't the sight, but the smell. It had the scent of overcoated paint, yet it had also smelled like wood chippings. Odd, I thought. Never felt like a attic can be decorated yet undecorated at the same time.\n\nAfter I somehow managed to get over the confusing scent, I looked around the loft. To say the least, it was hideous. Patches of unpainted wood stuck out of white plants, and the planks had splinters poking out. I swore I saw a cobweb in one of the corners of the window.\n\nIt looked like the previous owner had just painted half of the room before quitting. No, *vanished*. Almost as if the woman was correct. Almost as if-\n\nI realised that I was overthinking, and I needed to focus on other places. \n\nI was just about to begin to take out my paintbrush to begin repainting when I saw something.\n\nA door.\n\nThe first thing that felt wrong was the fact that it looked different. Mostly due to the fact that it looked more rustic than the others, with planks instead of panelled wood.\n\nWhen I saw it, the first thing I thought was, what? If you were in my shoes, you would be thinking the same thing. Normal people like me would act confused when they see some random door in their attic. It's more relatable when they don't tell you about it before buying a house. So I did what anyone would have done and called over Camilla.\n\nHer reaction was the same. Confused.\n\n\"Weird. I swear I didn't hear about some room in the attic… perhaps it's empty?\"\n\nAs soon as she said empty, my mind just thought about exploring. I didn't know why I would think that, but I decided to go with that anyway.\n\n\"I don't know, Camilla. But I can go into it to check it.\"\n\n\"Okay, Lucas.\" She gave a little grin, with an idea already forming in her eyes. \"We're going to take pictures, then show them to the previous homeowner. Perhaps we can also use it for a bathroom for Leo? I mean, even someone like him has to go to the toilet, and it's not like he can go up and down over and over again.\" \n\nWe made a truce. I would go in, take photos of the interior, and then show them to the previous owners, wherever they are. Perhaps they know it’s purpose.\n\nDespite the fact that the door must have been around a hundred years old, it opened like it just got lubricant applied to it. Behind the gateway, there was darkness. Not just darkness, but something like the void.\n\nJust nothing.\n\nUsing the phone's flashlight penetrated through nothing but even more of the \"void\". Whatever was in there, I just have to use the sense of touch and my acute hearing to my advantage.\n\nAnd with that, I entered right-foot-first.\n\nThe first sound that entered my ears was the creaking of wooden planks, groaning with every step. Judging from the echo, it seemed like the room was quite vast. Questions began to form in my head as I stepped into the darkness. If this room feels so vast, then how could it have fitted in without jutting out? Why did the previous owner not tell us about this room? And was the neighbour actually cor-\n\nThen, out of nowhere, the door slammed behind me.\n\nThe bang echoed loudly, with the gloom muffling and then devouring it entirely. Then silence. Nothing, except my yelp of shock and Camilla’s yelling.\n\n“LUCAS! Are you okay?!”\n\nEven though she was actually concerned for me, I somehow felt like she was the one who slammed the door.\n\n“Did you slam the door on me?!”\n\n“No! It just, um… how do I explain this?!”\n\n“What do you mean by that?”\n\n“As in, like, it just shut on itself! Didn’t put my hands on it, no wind gushing through, nothing!”\n\nHow weird. How could it shut on itself?\n\nLooking back at the door, I decided to open it back out, so that she would know where I was.\n\nLocked.\n\nThe door wouldn't budge a single bit. No matter how hard I shoved and pushed, it didn’t go a single centimetre. And yet it had no lock. The door had no lock, yet I couldn't even open it.\n\nI was stuck.\n\n“Camilla, I’m trapped within this place! Call the services!”\n\n“Okay, Lucas! Now… oh my GOD! I accidentally left my phone downstairs again! I’m going to go down to get it. Just please wait, okay? You’ll be out in no time.”\n\nBehind the door, I can hear Camilla’s footsteps treading down the stairs quickly. Then silence again. So I waited for her.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nBut then when I had checked my phone for the time, an entire hour had gone by. And she still hasn't come up yet.\n\n“Hey Camilla! Have you got the phone?”\n\nNothing except my echoes replied.\n\n“CAMILLA?!”\n\nNothing, again.\n\nFeeling that she had left for help, I shrugged it off, acting like nothing was wrong. Another hour passed. Then another.\n\nSoon, an entire day had passed and still, no one came. An entire day of waiting. An entire day wasted but waiting. To spend the time whilst I waited, I decided to take a walk.\n\nA big mistake.\n\nSoon enough, I had forgotten which direction I was going. I was now lost in this terrible void, of darkness and planks. So I went further into this empty space.\n\nStill, there was nothing. But still, I found something. A skeleton. It was curled up in a fetal position, in the agony of hunger. Within it, I found a phone within its rotten hands. A brooch. Within it, “*Together forever, Benito and Olive*”.\n\nBenito or Olive, one of them must have wandered into the gloom and starved in here. And that broke me. To starve in this wretched place will eventually take its toll and I will die. Lost.\n\nTrembling, I began to scream.\n\n“IS ANYONE HERE?! HELP! PLEASE, SOMEONE, ANYONE! HEEEEELP!”\n\nAgain, the land mocked me with the echoes of my wails as the only reply.\n\nSo I screamed harder and  harder, but with nothing calling back. I was truly alone in this plane.\n\nI desperately tried to scratch and stomp the planks, but to no avail. The only reward out of it were shredded nails and a throbbing foot. Tried to peer through the gaps to see what was below.  Nothing but even more darkness. \n\nI lost hope.\n\nGrabbing a canteen from the skeleton, I just began to roam further and further into the murkiness.\n\nAnd here I am, in this predicament. I should had trusted the neighbour.\n\nIt has been a week since I entered the room, and no progress has been reached. Condemned to traverse this shade. I am now lost, 7 days without food, barely able to ration water from the canteen, and utterly shattered. I am currently typing this with the last of my battery power so that I could at least warn people. So that will never go through what I had been through.\n\nThis will also be my last testament. It could be the final trace of my existence.\n\nI just want to get out. I want to be back with Camilla and Leo. To celebrate the existence of their lives.\n\nPlease, I have to get out.\n\nPlease, I don’t want to die in this horrible place.\n\nPlease.",

        "text": "Did anyone who lived around Seattle in the 90's remember Dr. Volkov's Children's Laboratory? I don't remember the specific town, my mum and I moved around a lot. But I definitely remember Dr. Volkov, and I remember hearing his commercials on the radio. I remember he said he'd give whatever families would let him borrow their kids  something like $100,000, which honestly sounds super suspicious, but hey, my mum was a single parent who just needed some cash.\n\nI was 8, I think, when she first signed me up, and one of my most vivid memories from this was walking into the lab for the first time. It actually looked pretty fun. It was like a giant playground, with slides and swings and anything else a dirty little kid would want to get their hands on. There were three other kids there, and we played hide n' seek together while our parents chatted and signed some papers.\n\nThen, Dr. Volkov came in. He had a very strong accent, which I couldn't place at the time, but I now recognize as Russian.\n\n\"Hello, families. I thank you for giving up your free time to take part in my studies. I assure you, if I am successful with these experiments, we will make history.\" He said, and the parents gave a polite applause. Us kids caught on, too, and gave our cheers, which were not as quiet.\n\n\"Once the parents leave, I will take the children and start my studies. They should be returned to you within the next year, give or take.\" He said, and the parents murmured to each other.\n\n\"Once again, thank you for your sacrifices. I will see the parents off now. Farewell. Children, say goodbye to mommy and daddy.\" Dr. Volkov said. We all waved goodbye, except for one girl, who ran up to her dad and hugged him. I wish I had done that now, too.\n\nAfter the parents left, Dr. Volkov turned to us.\n\n\"Hello, little ones. I am so excited to work with you! Now, follow me.\"\n\nWe followed him into the lab, which was decidedly less fun than the front of his lab. It was all white, with five rooms with big metal doors decorated the sides of the hallway, one for each kid. There was some strange equipment that I didn't know the names of.\n\nThere were four kids, three boys including me, and one girl. We introduced ourselves.\n\nThere was Michael (me), and Dalton, who were both eight. Then there was Cassandra who was nine. And the oldest, Andrew, was ten. Dr. Volkov explained that we'd still have time to play together, an hour a day, but most of our time was to be spent working on our experiment.\n\nDalton raised his hand. \"What's the experiment?\"\n\nDr. Volkov smiled. It looked almost fake. \"Who here has ever wanted to have superpowers?\" All four of us went ballistic.  We all wanted to be heroes. \"What if I told you that is made possible with us? That's right, over the course of a year, I will make you four into a group of super humans, each with your own special power.\" All of us clapped. This sounded amazing.\n\nAnd with that, we were sent to our rooms. The interior of mine was strange- no toys, or posters, or racecar beds like the one I had at home. There were a lot of lights though, but a lot of them weren't on for some reason. I was tired, so I laid down in my little bed, decorated with lightening bolts, and went to sleep. \n\nThe next day Dr. Volkov taught us more about the experiment. He was going to condition us all to have superpowers, and then make a sort of super team to fight bad guys. We all had different superpowers.\n\nI was going to get the power to manipulate energy, which made my room make a whole lot more sense. Dalton would be able to talk to the dead. Cassandra would be immortal. And Andrew, was going to gain the strength of a gorilla, which we all thought was hilarious when we first heard it. \n\nOur training was to begin immediately, and they sent us all away to separate rooms. \n\nI was sat in a large chair where on of Dr. Volkov's assistants named Katya, sat with me.\n\n\"Hello, Michael. How are you? We're going to make you into a super boy! Isn't that exciting? Now, this may hurt a little bit...\" Without warning, she pulled a lever, and the chair I was sitting on suddenly lit up. I had been shocked by an electric chair, and began to cry.\n\n\"Do not worry, little boy. It will not kill you, but it will make you strong. Don't you want electricity powers?\" \n\nI thought about it, and even though it hurt, electricity powers started to sound really cool. I nodded, and she shocked me again. I cried. \n\nAnd that was my life for the next while, getting shocked, crying, and getting shocked again. Until one day maybe two or so months later, when they tried something different. \n\n\"Here, hold this, Michael.\" Katya said, handing me a metal rod. \"This will hopefully conduct enough electricity to go through you and power that lightbulb. Put your hand on the lightbulb, Michael.\" I obliged.\n\n\"Now, ready? 3,21...\" She then shocked the rod, which sent electricity through me, and into the lightbulb. It hurt, but not as much as it should've. \n\nKatya smiled, and called Dr. Volkov into my laboratory. He was elated.\n\n\"It worked, child! See, all the days of training you to be resistant to electricity worked! Now we can continue our experiment! You earned your free time for the day, go play.\" \n\nIt wasn't until then, when I went to play with the other kids, I noticed the changes.\n\nWe all looked weirder, less normal. \n\nDalton kept on whispering to nobody, and wouldn't really talk to us. Andrew looked weirdly buff, and kept climbing on things. And Cassandra honestly looked kind of scary. She looked all stitched together, like a ragdoll. As Dalton stood by himself, Cassandra and Andrew and I sat and talked.\n\n\"I don't like these experiments, it's scary.\" Andrew said. \"They keep on giving me shots, and then I have to lift weights. It hurts my arms.\" I later learned that the shots they were giving him were injecting him with gorilla DNA, which is terrifying to me.\n\n\"I'm scared, too. They keep on hurting me. Every time a part of me dies, they stitch on a new one. See?\" Cassandra lifted her shirt, revealing part of her stomach had been stitched back on. \"They say that if we do it enough times, I'll be immortal.\" \n\n\"Did you see what they're doing to Dalton? My room is next to his, I hear it all the time. They make him sit with dead bodies, and then he'll talk to them. It scares him a lot.\" Andrew said. I looked over to Dalton. He had big circles around his eyes, and looked pale and gaunt. I wondered if he had secretly been replaced by one of the dead bodies. \n\nThat night, something weird happened. I was awoken by a bunch of red flashing lights and alarms. Something was wrong in the laboratory. Katya came and carried me out of bed, and I saw other workers carrying the other kids out of bed, too. Everyone except Dalton. \n\nWe heard a bunch of screaming from another room as the three of us were ushered into our playroom. I held Cassandra's hand, and Andrew stood in front of us, trying to protect us. \n\n\"I HAVE TO JOIN THEM! I HAVE TO JOIN THEM! THEY TOLD ME!\" We heard him yell as Dr. Volkov's voice desperately tried to calm him down. Screams, and then silence. For a long time. We slept on the stuffed animals in the playroom that night. \n\nWe never saw Dalton after that, and his door was boarded up. At the time I just assumed his mom took him home. But they didn't give us much time to look for him, because all of us had more experiments the same day.\n\n\"Michael, do you remember when you did a great job with that experiment and you made the lightbulb light up? Well, that was a practice round. Next month, we're going to do the real deal. We're going to put metal plates in your hands to make it so that you can conduct energy even without holding the metal rod. Doesn't that sound great?\" Katya said. I squirmed in my seat. \n\n\"Y-yeah.\" I lied, and we did more training. I will say, the shocks hurt so much less than the first time. It was getting easier. \n\nAs time went on, things got even more weird. Cassandra and I's room's were right next to each other, so we would see each other a lot. She kept on getting more and more stitched up. One time, while we were playing in the playroom we noticed Andrew wasn't there, which worried us.\n\n\"I heard Dr. Volkov and Andrew's worker, Alexei, talking. They said that he's acting strange, like a monkey. He's climbing everywhere, and attacks them if they get too close. He doesn't even talk anymore.\" Cassandra said, adjusting a stitched piece of skin on her face.\n\n\"Oh. How's your experiment going?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not very good. They say I'm making progress, and that the stuff they're giving me in shots is working. They say it's a chemical that makes people's endurance better. I think that's the word they used. But they still have to stitch me up sometimes. I don't know if it's really working, though. All they've been doing is hitting me with things and cutting me with things. Not even actually killing me.\" She said. I looked at her arm. To my surprise, it was had been completely sewn back on. \n\n\"That sucks. Mine's not going too good, either. I don't even have electric powers yet. I thought I would.\" I said. \n\n\"This place is getting boring. I'm sick of the playroom. Let's go exploring.\" Cassandra said, pulling me up from my seat as a stitch fell loose on her arm. I tried to resist, but she was strong. She dragged me through the halls, which were empty. I guess the workers were on their breaks. \n\nIt was like a maze in there. When we went past the children's ward, AKA our ward, we saw a bunch of medical stuff that looked weird. It looked fancy and official. There was a door at the end of the hallway, which Cassandra pulled me into. \n\nInside we found a bunch of documents. We picked them up and started reading them. \n\n\"The Volkov Experiment.\" She read out loud. \"Conducted to test the limits of the human body and mind, mentally and physically. Subjects, Dalton McDermott, Michael Porter, Cassandra Colombo, and Andrew Scott. That's us.\" \n\n\"Keep reading!\" I insisted.\n\n\"Subjects will be repeatedly tortured, under the rouse of being trained for greatness. They will be injected with placebo shots, beaten, electrocuted, forced to endure heavy physical activities, and locked in rooms with dead bodies. This experiment will test the theory formed by Dr. Dmitri Volkov, that if children are subjected to torture while under the assumption the result will be positive, along with being given positive reinforcement from mentors, they will experience less or different traumatic responses to said torture.\" We looked at each other. \n\n\"So you mean... we're not super heroes?\" I asked. Tears formed in Cassandra's eyes, and we heard footsteps somewhere in the hallway. \n\n\"We'd better get going.\" She said, grabbing my hand as more stitches fell loose in her arms. We raced down the hall and back into the playroom just as Katya walked in. \n\n\"Bedtime, children.\" She said, and she took us to our rooms where she tucked me into bed. I didn't sleep that night, at all. \n\nThe next day is when all hell broke loose.\n\nDuring free time, Cassandra and I decided to check on Andrew, who hadn't left his rooms in days. \n\n\"Andrew? Hello?\" We said, opening the unlocked door. \n\nWhat I saw in there will haunt me for the rest of my life\n\nHe was going, no pun intended, apeshit, climbing on the walls of his room. His eyes were glazed, like he had no idea what was going on. He wasn't even talking- just grunting and screaming. \n\nWe ran to get an attendant.\n\n\"Katya, Andrew's crazy! The gorilla DNA you put it him was working!\" I said, and Katya ran to hide us in the playroom. Andrew had escaped his room.\n\nCassandra and I pressed our ears to the door, trying to listen in. \n\n\"Subject 4 is reacting poorly to the gorilla DNA, Dr. Volkov.\" Katya reported, as they tried to track down Andrew.\n\n\"No, no, impossible.\" Dr. Volkov said. \"We didn't give him any gorilla DNA. It was a placebo.\" He said, and even though at that age I didn't know what a placebo was, Cassandra and I still looked at each other in shock. \n\n\"That's... fascinating, let me write this down.\" We heard him say.\n\n\"No, Dr. Volkov, there's no time, there is a breach in his room, he is somewhere in the building.\" Katya said, panicked.\n\n\"No, no, let me-\"\n\n\"Dr. Volkov, Subjects 2 and 3 are in danger, and so are we, there is no time!\" \n\n\"It won't take-\" \n\n\"Dr. Volkov!\" \n\nSuddenly, we heard screaming, and running, and chaos. \n\nI guess Andrew had found them. \n\nWhen everything was quiet, Cassandra carefully opened the door to the playroom. \n\nDr. Volkov and Katya, or at least what remained of them, were lying on the floor, in a mess of blood. Andrew in the corner, hyperventilating. He turned around, and rushed towards us. Cassandra screamed, but he stopped in front of us. \n\n\"A-Andrew?\" I said shakily, not even expecting him to say anything.\n\n\"Go. You're free.\" He hissed, and Cassandra and I stood there in shock. \n\n\"Are you stupid? They're coming. Go, before they get you.\" He said, and only then did we notice the men in biohazard suits running towards us.\n\nCassandra and I ran and ran, until we found the exit into the playground at the front of the building. \n\nWe heard gunshots behind us, and Andrew's screams.\n\nBut we didn't care, all we could do was run out the door, out of the hellhole we had been in for months. We waited outside the door for a while, waiting for Andrew to come out after us, but he never did.\n\nThat was the last I saw of the Volkov experiment. No documents were ever published, no police reports, nothing. Cassandra and I went our separate ways, back to our families, and soon mum and I moved towns. \n\nSometimes I wonder if I dreamt the whole thing. \n\nBut, last week at the coffee shop, I saw a girl with strange stitches up and down her body, and as she left with her drink, we made eye contact, and I knew she recognized me, too. \n\nI guess some things, you just can't make up.",

        "text": "Nothing could’ve made me prepared to find my wife dead in our cornfield one morning. \n\nI had been married to my beautiful wife for over a decade, and we had built our life together on our small farm in the middle of nowhere. We had always been happy and in love, but on that day, everything changed.\n\nI was out in the fields, tending to the crops, when I saw something that made my blood run cold. There, in the middle of our cornfield, was my wife's body. Her eyes were wide open, staring blankly at the sky, and her limbs were twisted and bent in ways that no human body should be able to contort.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing. I stumbled forward, my mind racing with shock and disbelief. How could this be? How could my beloved wife be lying there, dead and mangled in our own field?\n\nAs I got closer, I could see that her clothes were torn and her skin was covered in deep cuts and bruises. My mind couldn't comprehend what had happened to her. I fell to my knees beside her, tears streaming down my face. I was too late. My wife was gone.\n\nI stayed there for hours, holding her hand, trying to make sense of what had happened. But no matter how long I sat there, I couldn't come up with any explanation for her death. It was as if some unseen force had snatched her away from me, leaving me alone in the world.\n\nI was overwhelmed with grief and shock at the loss of my wife. I couldn't comprehend how this could have happened and how my beloved partner could be gone in such a violent and brutal way. I felt guilty and responsible for not being able to protect her, this thought consumed me. I was unable to escape the image of her mangled body.\n\nI was consumed by a deep sadness, a feeling of emptiness and despair, knowing I would never be able to see her or hold her again. The love and life we had built together now only served as a painful reminder of what I had lost.\n\nI called the cops. They found nothing. They had no fucking idea what happened with my wife. Someone or something killed her, and they had no idea who or what it was. \n\nI spent the whole day sitting in my room crying. I didn’t eat, and sometimes I drank some whiskey, but I did nothing else. Her body was already transported for further inspection. \n\nSomeone killed her. I couldn't rest until I had answers, so I decided to venture back to the cornfield at night.\n\nAs I approached the field, I saw that the ground was covered in a thick, pink, slimy matter. It was a substance that I had never seen before, and it seemed to be seeping out from the ground itself. I couldn't understand how it could have appeared so suddenly, and my mind raced with confusion and fear.\n\nAs I got closer, I realized the stench was unbearable. I had to hold my breath and cover my nose. I saw that it wasn't just the ground that was covered in the pink slime, but also the corn stalks themselves. They seemed to be wilted and dying, as if the slime was poisoning them. I couldn't explain what I was seeing, and I felt a sense of dread wash over me.\n\nAs I was illuminating the area with my phone, I saw a dead bird stuck in the slime. The poor creature had probably suffocated in that strange matter. I walked there, and touched it, hoping that it was still alive, and I could save it. I hoped I could at least save a bird, if I couldn’t save my own wife.\n\nThe bird’s body was already cold. As I touched its body, the slime stuck to my hand, and I couldn’t get it off. \n\nI couldn’t walk any further, the field was full of this sticky slime, I had to go back to my house. *I’ll check it out again in the morning,* I thought. At least I wasn’t focusing on my wife’s death.\n\nAs I turned my back to the field and started walking in the direction of my house, I heard some noise behind me. I looked back and saw the small bird, which I swear was dead half a minute before, was jumping out from the grip of the slime. \n\n“What the fuck?” I raised my eyebrows. “I’m 100% sure it was dead.”\n\nThe bird’s feathers were full of that smelly slime, but somehow the small creature could still fly. As it flew away and vanished in the dark, I thought I was going crazy. *Maybe it’s just the stress. I need a good sleep…*\n\nThe bird suddenly appeared again from the night sky, and attacked my face. I fell to the ground and tried to grab the bird, but it was still stabbing my skin with its sharp legs.\n\nAs soon as I could grab its neck, I snapped it immediately. It stopped for a second, then started to attack me again. I just couldn’t kill it. I don’t exactly remember how, but I could finally shake it off my head and run back to my house with bloody scars on my face. \n\nI was so tired, I just went to my bedroom, which was *our* bedroom just a few days before - It was still hard to believe she was gone - and fell asleep in a minute. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up early. I had to plan the funeral and inform our relatives about what had happened. I still had no idea what to tell them. As I went back to the cornfield, I was surprised to see that the pink slime was gone. There weren’t any signs it was there the night before. It just simply vanished. *I was just hallucinating because of the stress. It’s all because of the stress. It’s totally understandable.*\n\nThe day quickly went by, and when I arrived back home, I was just as tired as the night before, and I just couldn’t understand why. I wasn’t feeling well.\n\nI froze when I wanted to shower and looked in the mirror. My skin looked pink. It looked like that strange slime… it was leaking out of my skin. \n\nI dressed up again and rushed out to the cornfield. It was full of this slime again, just like last night. I still don’t know what the hell was that strange matter and how did it get to my farm, but I became panicked. It only appeared at night and was gone at daylight. And now it’s in my body too. \n\nI decided to visit a doctor tomorrow, and I went back to my house. Just as I was planning to go inside, I turned back and saw something that made my blood run cold. There, standing in front of me, was my wife. But it wasn't the woman that I knew and loved, it was something else.\n\nHer body was twisted and contorted, and her eyes were glowing with a sinister red light. She was covered in the same pink slime, and the stench was overwhelming. But what was most terrifying was the sound that came from her mouth, a bloodcurdling scream that seemed to come from the depths of hell.\n\nI felt a sense of overwhelming horror as I realized that this was not my wife, but some kind of twisted, monstrous version of her. I knew that I had to get away, but I was trapped in my own home. I backed away, trying to put as much distance between me and the creature as I could. But it continued to advance, its eyes locked on me, its screams filling my ears.\n\nI felt a sense of despair wash over me as I realized that there was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I rushed into the house and closed the doors as she was still beating the walls and windows, screaming.\n\nNow as I’m writing this, I have a feeling I’m gonna die. Maybe my dead wife will kill me, maybe I’ll die by myself. I’m feeling even worse. It’s the slime in my body, I know it. It’s killing things and taking control of their dead body. My wife is still knocking on the windows. I see her twisted face. I’m in tears, first I lost my wife, and now she’s back, but wants to kill me. It’s not her, after all. It’s the thing that had taken over her body.",

        "text": "It started eight years ago when I was seven and my sister was ten. We were playing in the woods in our backyard. It wasn’t unusual for us to venture far; our parents really had no idea. They figured we were safe, and they were right for a while.  We always came back after a few hours. Until, one night, my sister and I went a little too far and couldn’t find our way home.\n\nI remember it all so clearly.\n\n“Which way do we go?”\n\nAlana squeezed my hand then, a gesture I could only feel due to the inky blackness, the moon shielded by lush treetops.\n\nThere was a moment of hesitation before she answered, “This way,” and yanked me along.\n\nWhat seemed like hours passed.\n\n“Are we almost there?”\n\nAlana was in the lead, telling me when to duck and where to step. She grunted and growled before each instruction, making me assume she either got hit in the face with branches or tripped over rocks and didn’t want me to suffer the same.\n\n“I’m sure we’re nearly there, Alice,” she replied.\n\nShe sounded annoyed, whether at me, the situation, or both, I didn’t know, but I didn’t say anything else after that, not until I saw moonlight bathe a clearing up ahead.\n\n“Alana!”\n\n“I see it.”\n\nWe picked up our pace and broke through to the clearing, touched by pale gray.\n\nWhat took up the small space were five tall, slender boulders encircling a stone pillar. It was a peculiar sight. We had journeyed through these woods so often; we had never come across this.\n\nAlana approached it. I didn’t.\n\nI can still feel the moment her hand slipped from mine, the moment I should’ve pulled her back, told her no, but I was scared. I didn’t know what we were even looking at, but something wasn’t right.\n\nWhen Alana met the epicenter, she glided her fingers across its surface, her eyes widening.\n\nAt last, I found my voice, though my knees still wobbled. “Alana, I don’t think we should be here.”\n\n“They’re just rocks,” she said.\n\nI looked along the treeline, unable to see anything beyond it. I couldn’t shake an awful feeling like we were trespassing and being watched. I had always been afraid of the dark, a fear everyone, including Alana, admitted was irrational.\n\n*There’s nothing there*, they’d say without even sparing a glance. *There’s no such thing as monsters.*\n\nFor a brief time, I, too, had started to believe the phobia was irrational, despite not being able to shake it, but after this night, I think I’m well within my right to be terrified of the dark, even if no one can know why.\n\nAlana went from boulder to boulder, placing her hand on each. “Wonder how they got in a circle,” she said, expecting me to offer an explanation.\n\nWondering how those rocks were able to be moved was the last thing on my to-do list. Instead, I pleaded, “I think we should go.”\n\nAs Alana went to respond, the brush opposite us rustled. Branches crackled and broke. Leaves shook violently.\n\nThen, something emerged.\n\nTwo sets of antlers jutted out from the darkness, a larger set overshadowing a smaller set between them. Next came a head shaped like a deer’s, only strangely off-white and as smooth-looking as the antlers it bore. The rest of the bipedal creature was covered in brown fur, not unlike a deer, and all four of its limbs were hooved; however, what gripped me like a nightmare come to life was the way it stared at me with eyes that weren’t there.\n\nFrom a short distance, whatever the horrific thing was seemed small, hunched over, arms shriveled against its massive, heaving chest. But as it began to move, every one of its joints cracking, its body contorting, its neck snapping from side to side, nearly turning 180 degrees, it straightened its spine, vertebra by vertebra, growing taller.\n\nI froze in place, head unconsciously tilting back, following the beast’s height. Something warm streamed down my leg. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t breathe.\n\nI heard the words echo in my mind. *Alana! Run! Run!*\n\nBut nothing came out.\n\nThe beast crookedly stepped forward, like it was a chore, making its slow way toward my sister.\n\nAlana hadn’t moved either. She stared at what stood before her, towering over her, casting a looming, disconcerting shadow.\n\nIt reached out, bony fingers spreading, revealing tips impossibly sharp, black nails inches from Alana’s cheek.\n\nThe words that had been ricocheting off the walls of my skull finally found their way to my vocal chords, first coming as a shriek that halted the creature’s approach and had both its and my sister’s heads jolt in my direction.\n\n“Run, Alana! Run!” I yelped.\n\nThe creature let out its own feral screech and barreled its claws down on my sister.\n\nAlana’s body whipped and flew sideways, landing face-first into the grass.\n\nI screamed her name but cowered as the monster that attacked her began its ungraceful march toward me.\n\nI folded immediately, knees buckling under the weight of my own fear, tears and snot I couldn’t control streaming down my face as I whimpered like a wounded puppy.\n\nIt fell to all fours and craned its neck. It was so close to me, I could feel and smell its warm, rancid breath.\n\nI stared into the empty eye sockets of what appeared to be the skull of a buck, as if whatever this was wore the animal’s remains as a mask.\n\nIt stilled for minutes, picking me apart, and I waited, paralyzed and helpless, for it to slay me the way it did Alana. But rather than the terrible call it emitted moments before its strike, a soft, prolonged coo accompanied a slight upturn of its chin.\n\nI stayed as quiet as I could, thinking any noise would set it off, and I’d end up dead on the ground.\n\nIt leaned in. Every one of my muscles tensed as it sniffed. Its tongue, long and thin, slithered toward me, caressing my skin from my jawline to my temple, leaving what felt like a disgusting slime in its wake. When the appendage recoiled, the beast let out a hum and rose on two legs, the crepitus sawing my nerves. It raised its arm as high as my torso, fingers clenching and unclenching as its hand advanced. \n\nThe near-deafening *pop* and the creature collapsing happened simultaneously. Something wet splattered onto me.\n\nMy eyes fell to the creature’s unmoving body, limbs splayed out, a hole in its back oozing black viscous liquid.\n\n“Are you all right?” an orotund voice filled the clearing as a woman stepped into the moonlight.\n\nShe was tall, and her long, braided hair rested against her shoulder, its fiery color a stark contrast to her black apparel. A large rifle sat in her grasp, her posture relaxed as she made her way over.\n\n“What’re you doing out here, kid?” She looked down at me with a cocked eyebrow and a grimace.\n\nI frowned in turn, shock obviously still choking me before a groan grabbed my racing thoughts, anchoring me as if to pull me into the earth itself.\n\nAlana stirred but barely.\n\nI rushed to her side, dropping to kneel, hands hovering, contemplating what to do, what to say.\n\nShe shivered and rolled onto her back.\n\nHer face was covered in blood. Slash marks stretched from her collar bone to her waist line, tearing through her shirt, digging into her flesh.\n\nShe coughed; red droplets sputtered from her mouth. Her pupils found me, and her lips moved, but there were no words.\n\n“Alana?” My voice cracked.\n\nI didn’t want to believe it then, but I was watching my sister die, and I was powerless to help.\n\nFootsteps came and stopped behind me. “She isn’t going to make it,” the woman said rather coldly, like it was routine.\n\nI ignored her or, well, tried to anyway. She wasn’t wrong. Alana spat up blood, and her every breath was slow and shallow. She was going to die. She was going to die, and there was nothing I could do.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked, annoyed that some stranger was witnessing my sister’s final moments beside me instead of our parents. If I had the strength, I would’ve carried her home…wherever home was.\n\nThere was a pause before the woman spoke. “You can save her.”\n\nI shot her a look, vision blurred by tears. “What? What do you mean?”\n\n“Do you want to save her?”\n\nThe question hung in the cool night air only for the reason of my naive brain trying to catch up. Once it had, I nodded.\n\nThe woman glanced at the moon and swung her rifle around to her back before leveling her eyes on me. She reached out. “Give me your hand.”\n\nI stared at the gesture at first, but a terrible coughing fit from my sister had my arm springing forward.\n\nThe woman took my hand gently, turned it so my palm faced up, and placed something into it.\n\nWhen I retracted my arm, she crouched and whispered something close to Alana’s ear.\n\nAlana shut her eyes, and the rise and fall of her chest stopped.\n\nPanic set in. “What did you do?”\n\n“Quiet,” the woman said. “Put what I gave you around your neck.”\n\nI opened my embrace to a small wire pendant in the shape of spirals hanging from a black thread.\n\n“What is this?”\n\n“It’s called a Celtic Spiral Knot,” the woman explained. “It’s said to symbolize many things, like life, death, and rebirth.”\n\n“How will it save my sister?”\n\nThe woman took a deep breath. “Shut your eyes and picture her smiling.”\n\nI did as instructed, dubious to say the least, but I was desperate.\n\n“Hold onto that image.”\n\nI thought about the day Alana and I went to the zoo, and she got to touch the giraffes. They were her favorite animals. She was so excited; she couldn’t stop grinning for weeks after.\n\n“You won’t feel it happening.”\n\n“What?”\n\nI opened my eyes, but I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. I was alone, surrounded by a thick fog. The grass beneath me was yellow and wilted. Even the sky was completely black, no stars, no moon.\n\nI put my hands out where Alana was just seconds ago.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nThe only answer I got was my own echo.\n\nI stood and started to walk. No matter how far I went, it didn’t seem like I got anywhere. It was all the same—fog, dead grass, and a blackened sky. There was no one else around.\n\nI wasn’t scared, though. I didn’t feel much of anything, honestly. My tears had dried. My scrambled thoughts had calmed. My worry had subsided. I was at a sudden, strange peace. Nothing could touch me. Nothing could hurt me.\n\nBut the longer I stayed, the less I remembered from before I had even arrived.\n\nMemories became mangled messes of static. Names were stuck on the tip of my tongue but never came to be. My favorite foods, my favorite color, my favorite television shows…They were all draining away. My mom’s and dad’s faces…Did I even have a mom or a dad? And who’s A…Alaina? That wasn’t it. Alicia? No. What was it? Why couldn’t I remember, and who even was she?\n\nI was teetering on an edge I hadn’t realized I trod. Everything I knew was fading.\n\nWhen I was brought back, plucked from a place I now call Nowhere Land, it was like having someone startling you out of a deep slumber, and all you were able to do was gasp and breathe like you’ve never tasted air in your life.\n\nI noticed the breeze first; then, the navy blue sky freckled with white dots and a bright waxing gibbous pouring onto me.\n\n“She’ll live” in a stony voice interrupted a vague moment of serenity and, with it, came a whirlwind of emotions I had nearly forgotten existed.\n\nFear dragging its nails down my throat. Sadness poking behind my eyes. Solicitude plummeting my stomach to the soles of my feet.\n\nThat wind caressed damp cheeks that sent a shiver through me.\n\nWith stiff movements, in a second of what seemed like utter silence, I faced the woman with red hair and black clothes, eyes burning—she was standing now—and then I turned toward the girl lying in front of me.\n\n*Alana.*\n\nBlood still coated her body, but the marks of her cruel fate had disappeared, leaving only a tattered shirt showing where they once were.\n\n“I don’t understand,” I whispered. “Where was I? What happened to Alana?”\n\nThe woman’s next words stunned me, piercing my core.\n\n“You were dead.”\n\n“What?” I didn’t even hear myself speak. I felt detached; I was there, but I wasn’t.\n\n“The necklace, kid.”\n\nShe flicked her head at my open palm where the black-threaded necklace with the spiral pendant draped. What had she called it?\n\n*Celtic Spiral Knot. Life, death, and rebirth.*\n\n“It has a magical essence to it,” the woman continued. “As long as it’s in your possession, your sister will live. There’s just one condition.”\n\nMy fingers folded over the pendant, bit down into my flesh as I clenched a fist, bracing for what she had to say.\n\n“You share life essence now. This girl will live as long as you sacrifice your life essence to her.”\n\n“I don’t…” I was at a loss. I let myself trail off and simply gazed upon my sister who was now breathing steadily, like she was asleep.\n\n“Every night, you’ll give a little of your life essence to her in order to keep her alive. During the ritual, however, you’ll be dead for sixty seconds.”\n\n“Sixty seconds?”\n\nIt still didn’t make much sense, but that place…Nowhere Land…Was I really only there for a minute? It felt so much longer, almost a lifetime.\n\n“You’ll be asleep during the process, and it’s painless,” the woman insisted. “When your sister wakes up tomorrow, she won’t remember anything.”\n\n“But I will?” I placed my hand on Alana’s arm.\n\n“You can choose to tell her, but would you really want her to carry the burden of that knowledge?”\n\n“Burden?”\n\nThe woman sighed. “The more life essence you give, the less you have.”\n\n“Oh.” I wrapped my fingers around the fabric of Alana’s ripped shirt, as much clarity as a seven year old could have bulldozing me.\n\n“You have the choice not to.”\n\nThe woman turned and made her way to her prey. She cranked its head upward and, from a sheath slung across her back, drew a machete. It only took one strike to sever the beast’s head, after which the woman wiped her blade on the beast’s fur coat before re-sheathing the weapon.\n\nNot long after its decapitation did the beast’s body begin to disintegrate, particles caving in, piece by piece at first until they all came crumbling down. Within the gentle wind, the ashy remains drifted away.\n\nThe woman continued toward the woods, disappearing within the brush.\n\n“Wait!” I yelled, but she was already gone, and it was just me, alone with a slumbering Alana.\n\nOur dad found us nearly an hour later. I hadn’t moved, and neither had Alana. We were carried home, I in my mom’s arms and my sister in my dad’s.\n\nThey kept asking what had happened, especially seeing Alana’s torn clothes and bloodied, catatonic-like state and me frazzled, dotted with blood that wasn’t mine. I said nothing. I couldn’t really say anything. My mom was the one who decided to just let us sleep, that we would talk about it in the morning.\n\nThat was eight years ago. Like the woman said, Alana remembered nothing the next day. I was urged, many times, to explain the events that occurred, but the woman’s words replayed in my mind, ultimately dissuading me.\n\n*Would you really want her to carry the burden of that knowledge?*\n\nNo, I didn’t, and I never would.\n\nThe woman was right on something else, too. It’s a painless process.\n\nEvery morning, at 3 a.m., I visit Nowhere Land, and the only reason I know the exact time is because I’ve stayed awake so many nights, pondering this fate. I even wished it wasn’t true, that it was all just a nightmare my immature brain conjured from being lost in the woods so late at night.\n\nBut it wasn’t some nightmare, not the kind you have to sleep to see anyway.\n\nWithout fail, when the clock strikes 3 a.m., I open my eyes to the dark setting that has become way too familiar, a second home.\n\nI wander through the fog, memories hazy, faces of family, friends, and neighbors deteriorating until the endless abyss gives way to nothing. I don’t dream after leaving Nowhere Land, and when I wake up, I feel the same as when I went to bed the night before. The only thing I’ve noticed has been slight memory loss. I’ll have forgotten the name of someone I’ve known for years or something as simple as where I put the remote even though I was just holding it.\n\nI’m not sure what that means…The woman didn’t explain anything past the process and implication that I’m shedding time off my own life. I’m not sure how much life essence I’m giving to my sister or how much I even have left to give, but Alana wakes up every day, smiling, laughing, happy. I can’t imagine taking that away from her or my parents.\n\nShe’s eighteen now and on her way to college. Had I not done what I did, if I didn’t do what I still do, she wouldn’t get to experience this.\n\nI know I’ll die sooner, whenever that may be, but seeing my sister fulfill her life makes me believe it’s worth it.\n\nI never saw that woman again nor another creature like the one on that fateful night.\n\nUp until now, nobody knew this except that woman and me, and being only fifteen, it has been a heavy weight on my shoulders.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nPutting a finger to my left nostril, I let loose a stallion's snort to sharply escort the stench of ash out of my brain. Its momentary absence left no buffer to enter the realm of sleep before it came again, persistent as the clingy perfume of a prostitute. Another night and no relief. I didn't need to ponder the source of the smell. I knew it was pouring from every orifice of the Beast that I, in a dire yet impossible attempt, was trying to ignore. The creature loomed beyond the pane across from my bed, gently trickling her claws on the wood. A childhood memory of aspen branches haunting my skylight rose like bile, then faded bitterly.\n\nI pulled a pillow over my head. Fear had long ago removed its mask to reveal agitation. Boredom had long replaced anxiety; the sleepless dark, the smell, the creature confining me to perdition in house arrest. None of it chilled or thrilled me anymore. Time had no government here, fled with its subjects to some other world, far away, yet my patience faltered, slipstreaming with the beat of my heart. Surely by now the Beast had to be as dis-interested as I was of her little game.\n\nIt had really only been days since I'd woken in the new world, to discover I couldn't move one muscle in my body. Not a finger, not an eyelid. I could not even raise my chest in breath without her consent. The power of the creature whittled sensible thought down to a nub. Her very will could slam doors, break dishes, throw the covers off the bed. If she decided I wasn't going to rest, I wasn't going to rest. She was an unruly raven, gargling ominously, and prodding her beak at the half-dead rabbit of my normality.\n\nFor the second time that night, tucking the pillow back beneath my head and turning to face the glass, I captured her eyes at the window into my home, crippling me. Her pupils, catlike, were shimmering orbs of artichoke and fluorescent maize, flashing in and out of existence, broken only by a transparent and vertical third eyelid that slid into view from time to time. I couldn't see more than that of her warped body in the dark, but he could feel a predatory smile rove over his own skin.\n\n“Can't sleep?”\n\n*You know I can't.* Thought was the only function she allowed me, and she snagged onto every trailing wisp of it, slurping greedily on my rage, my discomfort, my original panic that had whittled down to agitation.\n\n“What a shame.” Her voice mocked from beyond the pane. It was deep and practiced, but warbled the hair in my ears. English clearly wasn't her first language, but she didn't struggle to speak it. So badly I wanted to draw a blind, roll back over and close my own eyes to escape this nightmare for another- but she wouldn't let me. Instead, I sighed and threw off the comfortable sheets, her will guiding me. My feet were chilled but I approached her, just beyond the window at an eager pace. Were the glass pane not in the way, our noses would have touched.\n\n“Might as well get up anyway.” Her voice echoed through a sudden explosion of light. She'd flicked on the nearby lamp and my pupils popped with stars. I blinked rapidly to chase them off, now beholding the grim appearance I begged to be a nightmare, and had accepted it was, but one I would never wake from.  It was somehow more terrifying lit than it was in the pitch. \n\n“Good morning.” She purred, leaning back and flickering her tongue along her teeth, lapping up my discomfort. “You must be-” She took in air as I glowered internally at her. “-so excited the weekend's over. Back to school!”\n\n*I'm not.*\n\nI headed for the washroom in practiced routine. The heat in the hallway betwixt the rooms blistered and licked at my pyjamas on the way.  When I can't see her reflected, this realm I am locked in lunges for me like a cat-  I hate the relief she brings when the mirror makes it fade away. I know she enjoys that hatred more than all the others. She knows I need her. \n\n As I turned on the faucet for water, I caught myself in her glassy stare once more in the glass. We moved in tandem. My hair was erratic and stuck up all over. Bags and worry lines wrinkled my profile as the bristles of the toothbrush grappled with last night's meat from my molars. I broke the fierce eye contact with a gargle of minty mouthwash.\n\nBack to my room to prepare for the day, through the charbroiled hallway. I shook from relief as the cool air of my bedroom curled about my face. It only stung when I couldn't see her, but always that smoky, ash smell persisted. As she sneered, my own lip curled up in reply. My eyes narrowed and drank in her features with renewed hatred and disgust.\n\nHer chest was flat and spattered with freckles and the odd hair. She had papery skin, white as milk but sinewy as a calf that lacked it. A tidy moustache balanced precariously on thin lips and a ginger sprig of hair hung limp both higher above and just below it.. She raised a black comb and I imitated her perfectly, parting on the left. The Beast donned my Monday clothes and I felt a quaking deep in my kidneys as I dressed with her. A white buttoned shirt, circle glasses with large black frames, royal blue tie done up unbearably playfully in a trinity knot and black corduroy slacks. \n\nIt was more than an exact doppelgänger of me- it was my own body, forcefully shed and replaced by another. She was a ghastly hermit crab, perpetually slinking from home to home and decided my skin was to her liking. All that was different was her eyes- her pupils bullied the irises out of their way to make them far too black. That and the knot she did up my tie with- She either didn't know how to tie a full-Windsor knot or did it just to annoy me more. \n\nAs she spoke, I felt his own mouth move.\n\n“I can really see myself in you.”\n\n*Stop this.*\n\n\"And why should I?\"  \nI didn't have an answer for that.\n\nThe trip to school was agonizing. Transit was a lengthy walk to the railroad and without a consistent reflection, I was a pendulum adrift in tumults of confining darkness. Cobalt and crimson chuffed greedily in this realm of inversion. White, whisker thin outlines sketched what might have been sidewalks in the living plane, but they boiled. The only light was spattered in brief paintings to the world beyond- windows in distant houses or shiny cars that stretched me wide for the briefest seconds and then snapped all my bones back into place. I hopped along in synch with my poached body, through puddles that reversed gravity and threatened to throw my empty stomach out of his mouth.\n\nSolace found me on the train, if only for a few stops. The Beast loomed large in the glass. I pressed my cheek to her, claustrophobic. A wry grin flashed and her filthy tongue slicked the grime off the public window. My torment, always comical, brought up raucous laughter that fogged my view as the stench of her smoggy breath belted my senses. An announcement overhead meant the school was the coming stop. She gathered her bags and bounced for the exit, plunging me back into the incinerating pool of darkness. I saw her for one brief moment more before she was cut off by a missing persons poster taped to the bus stop.\n\n\\~\n\nThe students listened with rapt attention as the Beast's charismatic voice called out to the classroom. I  willed my eyes, trying to see through the smear of the whiteboard as the mastery of the Bard boomed through the room beyond. The Beast was playing the role of Malcolm.\n\n“Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it; he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed, as 't were a careless trifle!”\n\nTraitors, the lot of them,  smiles glinting in the fluttering overhead bulbs. She had gifted the other parts out to the class during time I'd  allot for silent reading and note taking. A mousy looking brat of thirteen years provided Duncan a voice, and a blonde boy named Carter spoke as MacBeth himself. How dare they soil words so expertly lain in modern reprints, mocking thespians and my  classroom law in one fell swoop. The scene halted and analysis on it began from the rippled pupils.\n\n“Mr. Petterwick?”\n\nThe beast missed no beat. “Johnny-boy.”\n\nThe class stifled a giggle as John swallowed, clearly unsure if he liked being dubbed such. He'd been the studious type that I enjoyed teaching. “What did-” A pause, perhaps to check the name. “-Malcolm mean by that first sentence?”\n\nThe Beast mused from my desk and casually picked up the book, fidgeting, weighing it back and forth between her palms. \n\n“Does anyone have thoughts on what Malcolm meant?” A timid hand raised and the creature pointed at it. I fumed. That particular little wretch had never been interested in my class, more inclined to doodling on her desk and wasting everybody's time. The Beast's charm seemed to permeate beyond the sallow skin and a heat bubbled under my collar. Stupid children. How could they not smell her?\n\n“I think Malcolm meant that Cawdor did nothing in his life that was as nearly impressive as how he died. Is that right?\"\n\n“Very good! Catch!”\n\nSomething shiny sailed through the air and I felt seething hatred as one of my prized toffees was hurtled to- Serina's? Sabrina's - clutching hands. A reward for such an easy observation? I could feel the Beast smirk and knew it was another of her follies to annoy me. \n\nThe bell rang and the class filed out for lunch.\n\n\\~\n\nI could only smile at the thunderous plunk of the rock, smashing into my jaw and dislocating it. Bits of my cheeks fettered, holding tight to my teeth, while the rest rippled away and ripped  to pieces. It hurt as my eyeballs bobbed on the breathless surface of the pond as the Beast's felid gaze watched from above. I was drowning, unable to breathe yet unable to die. Another pebble soon rolled in her hand contemplatively beyond the edge of the stone precipice, on a balcony that overlooked the water from the outdoor lunch area. My streaming eyes shimmied and danced like flames as they reformed, stretching sinew to grasp my ear,  cheek,  scalped hair, broken nose. As I felt almost whole again, the severity of the pain lessened and, as if on cue, the next stone dropped and it happened all over again. I pleaded with her, the rot of muck and algae overflowing my senses. She rested her chin on her hand and smirked down, bored.\n\n*Why?*\n\n I knew why.\n\nSuddenly, the Beast was not alone. A black haired angel stepped up to join her at the railing.\n\n*Don't you dare*.\n\nLaverne Rouford, a school councillor, a woman who'd kept time of day as her own but her need to be loved as public as a neon sign. She dressed in a sunny green shirt with a black skirt, white stockings and black buckled shoes. Around her neck was a white ribbon and fastened to her shirt was a sticker promoting safe-spaces in schools. She was as cute and exotic as a unicorn, with a smooth Irish accent and smoother legs. She'd been hired out of desperation halfway through the semester, after the fourth disappearance, to help the students cope with grief. Her deep brown locks and green eyes often crashed ugly thoughts into my brain. She was always heralded by the smell of expensive perfume and the painful pull in my loins. Her breath on my face was a recurring daydream. Her hand rested on the Beast's shoulder, a look of concern on her face. They spoke at length and though my lips matched his captor's, I could not hear what buttery words slithered from my stolen mouth. Though, I was almost positive the phrase 'I suppose I'm not myself lately,' was turned. Laverne's fingers plucked like a bow on string, to and fro on skinny arm flesh, gripping it and whispering delectable secrets I would have slaughtered someone to hear myself.\n\n\\~\n\nAs the final bell's ring still pounded in my ears, I was crammed into the window of the train again. Laverne clung to the Beast's arm, infatuated. That cruel temptress, who had sneered in contempt at all previous advances, spurned my flowers and idly toppled chocolates into the trash, now hung off the body she'd dejected so many times. She'd always claimed she was wed to her employment, to the children's benefit, but she'd fallen for this facade like an idiot.\n\nCandles turned to pools in the living room hours later. Wine glasses clinked, pasta was slurped like meat from bone, brittle hands rubbed at warm shoulders before moving south to uncharted territory. I felt a strange déjà vu mixed into my disgust and contempt. As clothing became less and less, I only longed to cast my eyes elsewhere. Streaming briskly, we marched up the burning stairs to my bedroom, realizing my old life was a fuzzing memoir and it was the Beast that Laverne would remember. That the world would remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n“What's the matter?”\n\nMore hours had passed. Laverne was laying in a mess of warm blankets on the bed, exhausted. The Beast loomed close, cigarette breathed, pools of fire glinting through the bedroom mirror. For the moment, I could bring my limbs to obeyed my authority, though I did not register the sensation at first. A dog, after weeks of being on a short rope, may not realize it's been unchained. A chance at freedom can be smothered by expectation. I sucked air sharply in after a moment of recognizing she was no longer doing it for me.  I spent a few blissful moments eagerly stretching out my muscles. And then my tongue which I wasted no time making demands.\n\n“Release me.”\n\n*The Rohypnol had dropped into her cup with a splash.*\n\n“Say please.”\n\n*I'd offered her the water as she sat alone in the library.*\n\n“Now!”\n\n*I grinned nervously at her, the tablet dissolved. The primal need after rejection by Laverne was too powerful to ignore.*\n\nThe Beast pouted.\n\n“That's a mean tone you've taken, Mr. Petterwick. What's wrong? I thought that-” She gestured a thumb to the naked, ebony haired woman passed out on the bed. “-was your biggest fantasy. Didn't you enjoy the show?”\n\n*The book slipped out of her hand. I told her she didn't look well and helped her hobble to my car, complacent as a kitten.*\n\n“Let me out, you vile creature!”\n\n*The first kiss. A sensual rub. A promise she'd feel better soon.*\n\nShe bore down at him. “I thought a pervert like you enjoyed shit like that. But I suppose you're no voyeur. You'd prefer the hands-on approach.”\n\nThe Beast reached down and pulled a shed skin of the missing high school student off the carpeted floor of my bathroom, shaking it out like a wet towel. With a slimy protest, her fist entered an elongated ear hole- the exit wound of her own form- and traipsed up, squelching her fingers into the empty eye sockets and placing a thumb in the hollow between her chin and lower teeth. Another puppet.\n\n“'Just relax, Elise.' 'Oh, Mr. Petterwick!'” She chimed in a poor falsetto.\n\n“I said I was sorry!\"\n\n“'Mr. Petterwick, I want to go home.” The beast mocked.\n\n“Stop this! I'm sorry!”\n\n“Please, Mr. Petterwick!”\n\n“It was an accident!”\n\n“No, it wasn't. You knew exactly what you were doing to that girl. And the one before her. And the one before her.  You're only sorry now because you're getting punished for it.”\n\nA memory  flooded my mind. The ripping of flesh, being lifted by my sinuses, shocks of pain through my body. The claws piercing through the sponge of my nose, to my brain and slurping up my very essence like a smoothie. Turning inside out. The world no more than a death rattle as she pushed me through the mirror, into purgatory, a writhing mass of tentacles and claws left behind pulling my skin on like a new suit. The shed body of Elise, what she had been wearing, discarded in a heap on the floor.\n\nI snapped back to reality and felt my eyes wet with tears. The monster I'd become certainly deserved to be punished, but this? This endless burning, ash-soaked realm of pain and torment surrounding me while I was forced to watch another live my life? Be admired by the students? Be successful with the woman of my dreams? Never being driven to do the things I had to do? It was too much. Hell could not be worse than this. \n\n“You've punished me enough! Please, just...make it stop.\"\n\n“Aww, are you begging for death already? Just pitiful.” She assumed the falsetto voice once more and moved Elise's jaw, the morbid puppet. “Even I lasted a few months!”\n\nThe tears broke and wouldn't stop.\n\n\"You would rather I kill you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is that the only reason? Are you sure it's not the screams that bounce around in this head of your's? The last begging croaks of all the missing students you're responsible for? The ones that choked out for help, for their parents, as you squeezed the life out of them? The guilt of leaving no witnesses to your shame?\"\n\n\"STOP IT!\"\n\n\"I bet you never told Laverne of her power over you, did you? How her rejection drove you to madness, rape and murder?\"\n\nSalty snail trails paraded on my cheeks and I slammed my fist against the glass. The beast smirked and flung the husk  to the floor. She gnashed her teeth in a vicious smile and once again, she took control. My limbs snapped back to her will. \n\n“You don't want to watch me live your perfect life, right?” She leaned in close.\n\n*No.*\n\n\"Well, I can fix that easily.\" \n\nSmoothly, a bony fingertip raised to my tear stained cheek, until it found my eye. The squishy texture protested, yet gave slightly under the force. I wanted to scream, needed to scream. The Beast didn't let me blink, even as more tears pooled and rained. A bubbling static plucked my skin into gooseflesh, tickled pores and made a xylophone of my spine, and feverish sweat broke out all over my body. A vile squelching noise and blood splattered into the tears.\n\nLaverne lifted her head from the bed at the noise, turning to watch as a slurry of blood and tissue splattered the mirror. Curious and beautiful, she approached. To my surprise, she was watching me  in the mirror instead of the Beast. Her pupils were too large, catching light in catlike habitude. Her voice chimed, piano keys, as she walked over, putting her arms lovingly around the Beast.\n\n“Don't worry.\" She spoke to me directly from over the monster's shoulder. \"Our kind really doesn't need eyes to see.”\n\nThe finger began to press on my other eye.",

I don’t have much time for this draft, so let’s begin earlier—last afternoon, about eleven hours ago from when I’m writing this.\n\nSaturday, 12:47pm.\n\nMy sister and I watch Yoel plug his laptop into the hotel room’s television. He sits beside the TV as it displays my house, which is split into different panels named: “Cam 1,” “Cam 2,” “Cam 3,” and “Cam 4”. The first view was of my living room, the second was of my bedroom, the third was of my kitchen, and the fourth was of my bathroom. My guest room was ignored since I didn’t use it anyway.\n\n“Really? Cameras in his bathroom? That’s fucked up,” Cindy said.\n\nYoel snickered. “Remember, this isn’t really David we’re gonna watch. I need much info on this and its behavior. Its level of detail.”\n\nMy sister scoffed. “Creep.”\n\n“Listen, you’re not even supposed to be here,\" Yoel said. \"If you stay, then you must want to watch your brother’s ass; I’m doing it for study. The cameras will be removed when this is all over and David can safely go back home.”\n\nI chuckled. \n\nIf you’re unaware, I ended up doing exactly what Yoel requested in my previous post. Except, after telling my sister everything that was to go down, she forced me to tag her along. Cindy still had her doubts, and I couldn’t blame her.\n\nShe made sure to let me know this even before we made it to the hotel: *“You know this could all still be bullshit, right?”* Cindy said, as she steered the wheel of my car.\n\nI had to let her drive on the way there because I couldn’t get over the perpetual feeling of wanting to puke.\n\n*“Even after everything you saw when I showed you that recording?”* I said.\n\n*“I heard my voice on that phone. And yeah, it really did look just like you. That was all freaky, I’m not gonna lie,” Cindy said. “It’s just so hard to believe, you know? Ghost and shit actually exist? All that paranormal stuff is real? Come on, David, what if this whole thing is a setup by this guy?”*\n\n*“It’s real,”* I responded. *“Believe me, I had those same thoughts. But you didn’t spend night after night in my house. I could feel it, sis. I don’t know if it’s dark energy, or ‘supernatural intuition’ or whatever the fuck he called it. But this is all real.”*\n\n*“I hope you’re right,”* Cindy said.\n\n20-minute drive later, 15 stories up a hotel, and now we were watching a live recording of my house. Waiting for this thing to show up.\n\nIt wasn’t showing up, though.\n\nI gulped. “It’s running late. It usually walks through the door by now. Well, from what I’ve seen anyway.”\n\n“It’s taking its sweet time, but it’ll be there,” Yoel said. He locked his fingers together behind his head.\n\nI bit my nails. “What if it knows what we're up to? What if the camera crew alarmed it or something?\"\n\n“That would be unfortunate. And awkward,\" Yoel said. \"Don't overestimate this creature's ability or intelligence. In any case, it’s a would-be workday for you, right? It believes you’re at work, so I don’t see why it would break habit now of all times.”\n\nAs he finished his sentence, the sound of my door unlocking through the footage alerted us all.\n\nCindy gasped as she witnessed a live feed of the other 'me' walking into the house.\n\nMy Mimic carried grocery bags in both of its hands.\n\nSo that’s what it was doing. It was buying things to stock my fridge.\n\n“He’s like your fucking roommate or something,” Cindy said.\n\nI could see Yoel’s brows were tense. I wondered if he had ever heard of a Mimic exerting this level of behavior.\n\n“Alright. It’s in my house, what now?” I asked.\n\n“Hey. David. This elaborate setup ain’t for shits and giggles. Allow us a few hours of watching this thing,” he said.\n\n“Seriously?” Cindy said, her foot tapped rapidly against the beige carpet.\n\n“It’s alright,” I responded. “I figured you’d want that. You need as much record of this as possible, right? Might as well.”\n\nYoel snapped a finger and pointed. “You’re the man, David. Correct. It’ll be nice to add hours of modern evidence and study into the Mimic catalogue. All leading up to when we finally decide to interact with this thing using the radio. If I ever actually get to post this one day, that’ll be the cherry on top.”\n\nWe spent the next few hours watching the footage. Truth be told, it was kind of boring. Nothing changed, it still did the same things I would normally do. Pretend to read, watch TV, clean, eat junk food.\n\nThe three of us even began a game of “I Declare War” on the mattress.\n\nYoel was spading us into oblivion.\n\n“Damn, how the hell are you good at this game?” I asked.\n\nYoel shrugged. “Meh. It’s all in the cards.”\n\nEventually, my other me laid down on the living room couch and we could tell it was beginning to doze off.\n\nYoel headed back to the seat by the television. “It’s not a good idea to let it sleep. Let’s get this thing started. Ready? In a moment, you’re gonna come over here to this little microphone, push the grey button on the side and start talking.”\n\n“Wait, what does he even say to it?” Cindy said.\n\n“I’m getting to that,” Yoel said. “All you have to do is convey how you feel. You want it to cease its copying of you, and strike for a halt on the stalking all together. Articulate that to the best of your ability, kay?”\n\n“Sure, but what if it refuses,” I said.\n\n“It won’t…probably. Most likely,” Yoel said.\n\n“That’s real assuring,” Cindy said.\n\nYoel sighed. “All the sources indicate that this should work. To catch it red-handed is the best way to confront it. Listening to David’s plea, it’ll feel heartbroken to have caused him so much trouble. How it’ll react from there depends on two variables, both resulting in the stoppage of its mimicking.”\n\n“All this for such a simple resolution? No way,” Cindy said.\n\n“Wait, what two variables?” I asked.\n\nYoel cleared his throat and continued. “The Mimics are described as either being male or female. Whichever gender it is will determine its reaction. A female Mimic is known to be a lot more understanding. It’ll listen, and if confronted politely, it’ll abandon you all together, moving on to find a new lover. These types of Mimics actively seek hosts to copy and replace. Male Mimics are different. They tend to accidentally form an obsession with a human, but then won’t be able to easily let it go. It’ll care for you enough to not replace you after the confrontation, but likely, it’ll continue stalking you for the rest of your life. From the shadows.”\n\n“That’s fucked. We can’t let that happen,” I said.\n\nYoel shook his head. “You’re gonna have to nut up, and veto Murphy’s Law for the time being. Either way, you live through both results. We’ll worry about the conditions later,” he said, then reached over into a drawer beside him. “I prepared a script for you, if you’d like. Though, I’d recommend authenticity.”\n\nI waved my hand. “I got this.”\n\nYoel got up from where he sat to allow me to sit there.\n\nI planted myself next to the microphone, aimed the mic towards me, and my finger inched towards the grey button.\n\nDeep breaths. “What am I gonna say?” I thought. Figured the words will come as I go. He said to say how I felt. So that’s what I wanted to do. Figured, it was best to treat this thing as a person who is non-belligerent, who doesn’t mean any real harm.\n\nI pressed the button.\n\n“…Hey, ‘David’?” I said into the mic.\n\nHeard a low grunt from Yoel behind me. I guess he didn’t expect me to address the thing by my own namesake.\n\nMy doppelganger made a slow rise from where it laid its head on the couch. It looked around, aimless.\n\n“David…” I continued. “You hear me? It’s me. The person you’ve been copying. The real David.”\n\n“What…?” The Mimic said, in a manner I would say it. An excellent impression. It sat up from the couch completely then stood.\n\nYoel snapped his fingers in rapid succession behind me.\n\nI hastened to continue. “Hey, I know you’ve been infatuated with me as of late. I know what you truly are. And I get it. Sometimes you come across this once-in-a-lifetime thing, and something just clicks. And before you know it, you can’t imagine your life without it. Here’s the thing: I know you mean well, and I appreciate how you’ve held down the pad when I’m not around, but I can’t sleep at night knowing you’re there. Humans and folks like you just don’t mix well, y’know? And if this keeps up, I don’t think this relationship will end on a good note. So. . . if you could just move on—. . .if you could not do this ever again, that would be nice?”\n\nThe Mimic stood frozen for a long time, maybe a couple minutes. Like it was in some state of pure shock.\n\nI look back at Cindy and Yoel. Their eyes were glued to the screen.\n\nThen the Mimic spoke again, and my attention returned.\n\n“…You expect me to just go away? After all I’ve done for you?” The Mimic spoke in a tone of voice I haven’t heard from myself since my father passed away. It then closed its eyes, like it was focusing.\n\n“What the fuck. . .” Cindy whimpered out.\n\n“Please?” I begged.\n\n“Oh, David. . .” it said, standing completely still. “I don’t think you understand our relationship at all. I never wanted to replace you, sweetie.”\n\n“What?” Yoel said. He was taken aback.\n\nWhat did this mean? Never had I voiced my knowledge of it wanting to replace me.\n\nMy voice slightly raised, I replied. “The only thing I understand is that I don’t want you to be in my life anymore. You’ve been stalking me, watching me, living in my home without my consent. I want it to end. Surely you can understand that. If you don’t want to replace me, what do you want?”\n\nI blinked, and in that fraction of a second, it was in front of the living room camera. A melting, corroded version of my face stared into the lens, as if peering at us through a window.\n\nAll three of us gasped and jumped out of our seats.\n\nCindy shrieked.\n\n“Oh shit,” Yoel said. “David. . .”\n\nHe was at a loss for words, as I was.\n\n“If this is some fucking elaborate prank for some Television show, Yoel, then this is a dandy time to bring out the cameras,” Cindy said. “This has gone too far.”\n\nThe Mimic’s impersonation of my face continued to melt off. It backed away from the camera as something seemed to be wrong with it. It held its face in pain, trying to hold together the flesh that was oozing off of it.\n\nIt spoke again but it wasn’t my voice anymore. It was a foreign cadence, scratchy. “It wasn’t supposed to be like this. You’re ruining everything.”\n\n“Yoel? What’s going on? What’s happening?” I said.\n\nHe didn’t respond, instead went for his briefcase, and took out one of his books.\n\nI stared back at the television. All of its skin formed a puddle of some kind of essence on the carpet. What's left was some kind of green creature with black hair extending passed its backside. It had a feminine frame about it. I guessed it was a female.\n\n“. . . But I thought females were the safer ones?” I thought.\n\nThe Mimic, writhing, gaped its mouth. It screeched as its body contorted and cracked open.\n\nThe screech was powerful.\n\nIt’s not like it could only be heard through the setup, it was loud enough to be heard even from outside the hotel’s walls. Imagine the volume of a siren for an upcoming weather disaster. I was sure the entire city would have heard it. Yoel and I were brought to our knees, pushing palms to our ears.\n\nCindy, however, wasn’t reacting. She came to my side asking what the fuck was wrong with the both of us.\n\n“Can you not hear that, sister? How can you move? It’s so loud, it’s terrible,” I said.\n\n“My ears are gonna bleed,” Yoel said.\n\nAs the noise persisted, I looked back at the television. As this thing whaled, my house was going through a tornado. My couch, lamps, chandelier, TV, swirled around—the Mimic as an epicenter.\n\n“My house. . .” I grunted out.\n\n“Your house is being torn to shreds, David. This is insane, but where’s the thing? Where did it go?” Cindy asked.\n\n“What do you mean? It’s right fuckin’ there. Yellin’ its ass off,” I said.\n\nCindy squinted; her eyes were aimless as she examined the screen. “I don’t understand.”\n\nThe noise ceased. Finally.\n\nI only then noticed why it was in pain. There were things crawling out of its skin. The main Mimic itself was more humanoid, but these things were almost exactly what Yoel showed us in the book. Tens of them. It didn’t make sense, though. The proportions were off. How could so many of these things be crawling out of a body that couldn’t have possibly been holding them all?\n\nYoel flipped through his pages. “Oh dear. . . This can’t be happening.”\n\n“What is it?” I asked.\n\nYoel turned to me, a grim look. “David, you unfortunate bastard. It’s a Mother Mimic.”\n\nI shot up. “What does that mean?”\n\nBefore he had time to explain, I heard…god, I don’t even know how to describe it. The little creatures that came out of her made phlegm filled groans and chants.\n\nThe mother lifted her finger toward the camera. “Bring him,” it said.\n\nAll of the eyes in that room aimed their gazes at us. They rushed towards the lens and clawed at it.\n\nYoel grabbed his suitcase and dashed toward the door. He turned back. “Let’s go. We gotta go. Now.”\n\n“Can someone explain to me what the hell is happening?” Cindy asked.\n\nI grabbed my sister’s arm. “What about the footage—”\n\n“Forget it,’ Yoel interrupted, “We’re gone.”\n\nI heard a crack. Couldn’t believe it. One of those thing’s arms came through the Television. It was able to grab the edge of the drawer it was on top of, attempting to pull itself through.\n\nThat was all I needed to see. I tugged Cindy and we made a break for it.\n\n“Head for the stairwell, obviously the elevator means death,” Yoel said as we entered the hallway.\n\nWe undoubtably caused a scene with whoever staff, maintenance, or guests that happen to be on the floor. I turned back and saw four of the little creatures exit the room. As Yoel burst open the stairwell door, I noticed the little monsters didn’t even bother with anyone else who was present in that area. It also didn’t seem like no one even noticed them, more concerned with the three of us running like mad men.\n\nWe raced down the stairs. Cindy didn’t seem to know what was going on, but she at least went with it enough to where I didn’t have to hold her arm. The monstrosities cackled as they chased us down the swirled path of stairs. Some attempted to jump down the middle in an attempt to land on us. One caught my arm, and I turned back to throw a jab at it to set myself free. Yoel had to give a hard kick to one that landed at his feet. Adrenaline coursed through me, chest burned, temples pulsing, I felt like I could’ve ran for days.\n\nWe made it to the lobby and slammed the stairway door behind us. Everyone there looked at us, baffled. Not wanting to halt another second as we heard the echoes of their scramble, we bumped into shoulders and jumped over luggage in order to get to the exit. Of course, the demons behind us continued their pursuit with no attention thrown their way by any other person.\n\nThere was a problem, though. The parking lot was underground, and I could tell by the look on Yoel’s face that Cindy &amp; I’s ride weren’t the only ones that were down there. Even if we had gone to the garage level, there was no way we could’ve pulled out in time.\n\n“Screw it, follow me,” Yoel said. Mid-run, he dug into his luggage and took out a pistol.\n\n“What? Are you crazy?” Cindy said. I could tell she was moments away from collapsing.\n\nYoel jumps in front of a blue Volkswagen that was making a turn. He aimed his gun at the driver’s side and demanded him to get out the car.\n\n“Are you kidding me? You’re out of your mind,” the man in the vehicle said.\n\n“Shut up. Get out,” Yoel replied.\n\nI saw the monsters approaching. There were dozens of them, some huger than I would’ve imagine. They were moments away from leaping at us.\n\n“Get in,” Yoel said. He’d manage to get the guy out of the car. We jumped in with him.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said to the stranger through the window.\n\nOne of the things jumped on the trunk but couldn’t get a grip and fell off as we sped away. Through the passenger seat mirror, I could see the man standing in disbelief next to the creatures. The damn things must of realized there was no way they were catching up.\n\nIt took us several minutes to catch our breath.\n\n“You just stole someone’s car,” Cindy said from the backseat.\n\n“What, this piece of shit? Trust me, he was begging for someone to take it off his hands,” Yoel said.\n\nCindy scoffed. “What is wrong with you? David, why did we just go along with that?”\n\n“If you had any idea what we were running from, you wouldn’t complain,” I said, on the verge of throwing up.\n\n“Precisely. In reality, Cindy didn’t have to tag along,” Yoel said. “It seems she couldn’t process that level of insanity. Just like all the others back there. She was safe the whole time. Cindy, what’s the last thing you remember seeing?”\n\nCindy put on her seatbelt. “The other David’s face covering the screen. Then it disappeared. Then shit started flying around in his house and you guys went nuts.”\n\nYoel nodded his head. “Cindy, you can be classified as a civilian. Ordinary people. Sometimes, though, ordinary people get wrapped up in the supernatural and no longer live normal lives. Sometimes, they channel enough energy to be able to perceive things they aren’t normally supposed to. That’s what has happened to David. All thanks to that Mimic contacting him.”\n\n“So, what now? Is my life over?” I said, checking the rear-view mirror, waiting to see sirens pop up.\n\n“Not necessarily, but I hope you saved a lot of money, because you need to get far away from here, David,” Yoel said.\n\n“Why? What the fuck is a Mother Mimic? You only said there were two kinds,” I asked.\n\n“I said male or female, I technically didn’t lie about that,” Yoel sighed. “Well, beside from the absolute mayhem it bestowed upon us, not much is known about them. Mimics themselves are vague legends, David. One of the few examples was from the 1600’s for goodness’ sake. My sources gave me brief mentions of the possibility of a mother's existence, but there was no credibility to it. No accounts to tell. The books themselves couldn’t verify anything. And from manuscripts that struggle to verify jack-shit to begin with, that says a lot. No point of bringing it up beforehand.”\n\n“What makes it different from the other two variants?” Cindy asked.\n\n“The only piece of detail about it said that it seeks to not replace its lover, but to make a father out of a male human,” Yoel said. “It’ll ritualistically impersonate David enough to obtain the power necessary to drag him into its main plain of existence. I have no idea what a father Mimic’s roll might serve, but Imagine existence in an abstract. You're unnable to comprehend anything you’re feeling or seeing. Forced to operate on a higher dimensional realm, enslaved by a higher power. A fate worse than death.”\n\nI wanted to cry. “How far do I go? Another state? I mean, shit, man, it climbed out the TV. Before, you said it could follow me anywhere.”\n\n“It’s complicated how these entities work,\" Yoel replied. \"In order to take effect on the physical world, they can only use the mind and imagination of a person they’re connected to. It can follow you, but not anywhere. It was only able to do what it did back there because of your direct contact—by talking with you. We gave it enough connection, enough liberty. The farther the space between you and it, the less contact you’re giving it; therefore, the weaker its connection. Make sense? It won’t be able to find you.”\n\n“. . .I have family in New Mexico. . .” I said.\n\n“Perfect. I’ll pay for your ticket myself. I am sorry this happened, David. You can’t even pack because that would require you to go back home.”\n\n“My aunt and uncle will take care of me,” I said.\n\n“I’ll go with you, David,” Cindy said.\n\n“You don’t need to,” I replied. “You have work.”\n\n“I’ll call off. Just for a week or two, then I’ll fly back home, okay? I can’t let you go through this change by yourself.”\n\nI reached into the backseat and gave Cindy a hug.\n\nWe drove nonstop for hours. By the late evening, we were able to score a rather expensive last-minute flight. It's set to take off in the early morning hours, Sunday. Yoel kept his word and paid for everything. We even had time to stop by a couple of retailers to give me a luggage filled with a decent supply of clothes and some shit to eat. I don’t have much else with me but a phone &amp; charger I’m using to type this draft. It’s currently 6:38am as I’m writing this, next to my sister, waiting for the plane to arrive.\n\nGuess I’ll crash at my aunt and uncle’s place until I can find out my next move. This is going to be a complicated change.\n\nThis will also be my last post on this matter. I don’t imagine anything else crazy happening as long as Yoel was right and I don’t stay in the proximity of that thing.\n\nThanks for all your supportive comments and be safe out there. Be on your guard. Most of you will never have to deal with anything like this, but for you unlucky few, know you’re not alone.\n\nSigning off. Wish me luck.",

        "text": "This never happened to me personally, but my brother told me the story about 2 years ago in a conversation about scary stuff we’ve experienced. This one was the most chilling of the few shared between us.\n\nAround 2-3 years ago my brother and 2 of his friends decided that they were going to camp in the woods near a local town that was about 15 minutes away from where we lived. I think at the time he was around 18 at the time and his friends were similar ages. They all gathered the typical necessities you needed while camping. A tent, some sleeping bags, pots and pans, and an axe. \n\nI don’t know most of the details about what happened in the hours leading up to night, but I would guess they just did normal stuff you’d do while camping. Now it’s around 1 AM, and since they were in the woods it was pitch black. You couldn’t see much of anything if you were to get out the tent to go piss or something else.\n\nAround that time my brother had said he heard a light whispering. It wasn’t completely inaudible, but he couldn’t make out what was being said, or if anything was being said at all. At first he didn’t take any mind to it and went back to sleep. Around 2 hours later the whispering came back, and it was louder. Like almost it came from outside the tent. Both of his friends heard it this time and all 3 knew something was up. They were completely scared of the situation.\n\nTheir car was parked 2 miles away from where they camped at (or at-least he told me so). And since it was around 3 A.M now it was still pitch black. So it was either they stay in the tent and pray whatever was whispering was not looking for them, or they make a run for it to the car. They chose the latter. I mentioned earlier they brought pots and pans, and an axe. My brother grabbed the axe just incase they had to fight whatever was making the noise, and one of his friends (let’s call him John) grabbed the pots and pans. My brother’ and John’s phones were dead, but friend #2 (let’s call him Joey) phone still had about 10% of battery. They planned to lock arms in form sort of a triangle facing towards the trees. John started banging the pots and pans in hope of scaring the thing away, Joey used his phone as a flash light, and my brother prepared to swing the axe at anything that jumped out at them. In about an hour and a half they made it to the car and got the hell out of there.\n\nMy brother never knew what was outside their tent, but he theorized it was a meth addict since that area was notorious to be home of a few meth heads. It could’ve been a bear stumbling around in the night, or maybe a cult doing a sacred ritual, but he’ll never know for sure which is truly terrifying.",

        "text": "I was something of a basement connoisseur when I was a kid. Our family didn’t have one, which wasn’t that uncommon in the tornado-free San Francisco Bay Area, so I loved checking out a good basement when I could. My friend Joshua had a concrete-floor basement where his parents let us conduct science experiments of the exploding volcano variety. Another friend, Logan, had a finished bottom floor that I counted as a basement because it was technically subterranean, and in which we got to play video games, eat a disgusting number of Sour Patch Kids, and generally live the good life on the days when we weren’t jumping on his giant trampoline or when his parents weren’t taking us on a Jelly Belly factory tour (he was rich, it was a sweet setup). And then there was Kevin’s basement, which was really special. For one thing, it had a laundry chute that connected with the second-floor hallway upstairs, and we would throw his little sister’s Bratz dolls down it to see if their heads would pop off. Plus, it had the perfect combination of playing-around space (the rug-covered concrete floor section) and creepy space (the place where the finished part ended and packed dirt formed a gradual slope up to the concrete wall, getting closer and closer to the exposed beams that made up the ceiling on that side of the basement). A couple of exposed-filament incandescent lights were strung up haphazardly in the creepy area, making me think of the mineshaft in an Indiana Jones movie.\n\nOne listless Saturday afternoon—September 10, 2011, to be exact (for some reason I was really aware that the ten-year anniversary of 9/11 was the next day)—Kevin and I were playing tennis in the basement. Well, by tennis, I mean we were playing wall ball against a support beam, throwing the ball overhand instead of using rackets. We stood in the non-creepy part of the basement, but were facing the support beam that seemed to mark the threshold of the creepy section. Being children with generally poor aim, we often missed the beam, causing the tennis ball to make contact with the dirt, but because the dirt sloped, the ball usually rolled back. The fifth time the ball ended up in the dirt, though, it got lodged against a little ridge, and didn’t automatically make its way back.\n\n“Go pick it up, you threw it!” Kevin said shrilly.\n\n“No way man, you do it, it’s your house!” I pushed back. There was no way I was going to risk getting bit by a spider in my friend’s basement, but I didn’t really want to let Kevin know that I, a recently minted eleven-year-old, was afraid.\n\n“But there might be black widows up there, and I’m scared of spiders!” Kevin protested, clearly less embarrassed than I. He rubbed his bare arms unconsciously, probably sweeping for bugs.\n\nIn the end we agreed to go together to retrieve the ball; it was a matter of just a couple of yards, and the only spiders we had ever actually seen in the basement up to this point had been daddy long legs (even these freaked Kevin out, but I was personally able to handle those at least). We scrambled quickly up the dirt hill, ducking our heads to avoid hitting the overhead beams. The ball was close to the top, in an area saturated with shadow despite the mounted lights. I got my hands around the ball before Kevin did, and was looking to see if I’d break anything by throwing it back down to the concrete when I noticed something.\n\n“What’s that on the wall?” I asked, stepping to the side to reduce the amount of shadow I myself was casting on the area in question. “Did your sister do this?”\n\n“I don’t think so,” Kevin replied, now also looking at the chalky purple outline of a door on the concrete wall. It was just a drawing of a rectangle with a smiley face for a doorknob on the left-hand side, but what it represented was clear. I felt a wave of nausea pass through me, then subside.\n\n“I don’t like it,” I said, without then knowing why, and took a step away. Kevin seemed to feel otherwise, as he instead stepped forward and tapped with his closed fist on the wall. A knock on the door. The lights in the basement went out—I mean completely black, so black that I didn’t even register light from the small windows on the other side—and I felt that nauseous wave again, followed by a tingling in the palms of my hands. Just as I noticed that I was holding my breath, the lights came back on, and I gasped in the earthy scent of soil and old wood.\n\n“What the hell just happened?” I asked, dropping an h-bomb because the situation seemed to call for it. Kevin was facing me straight on, his arms by his sides, a subtle slackness to his face that I didn’t recognize in him.\n\n“It let us in,” Kevin replied simply.\n\n“Uh, OK . . .” I said. “I didn’t move, though . . .”\n\n“And it let us out, too.” Kevin said with a sigh, as if this explained it. Kevin and I both noticed, at the same time, a shiny black spider crawling on Kevin’s hand. Kevin calmly raised his arm to his face and blew the spider off in my direction. Then he smiled.\n\n“Time for you to go home, I think” he said.\n\n\nThat was the last time I chose to go to Kevin’s house, and I didn’t invite him to my place either. We went to the same school and lived in the same neighborhood, so there was no natural reason for us to drift apart, but I just didn’t have any desire to spend time with him after that day in the basement. It was nothing I could pinpoint, but looking back as an adult I would say our friend chemistry was gone after that day, and it also weirded me out that he had basically launched a black widow at me. At the time, the spider incident was what really stood out to me about basement day anyway; I wasn’t thinking about the door or the blackness.\n\nThe following September—on Monday the 10th, actually—a girl at our middle school, Sara, went missing. Kevin and I had math with her for the final period of the day, and even though I didn’t really talk to Kevin any more, I did notice that he left class about three minutes early that day because I thought it was random that he couldn’t just stay for the whole thing when class was almost over anyway. When the police talked to the students who had seen or interacted with Sara at all before she disappeared, I explained to them that Sara walked out of the classroom before I did, and that she wasn’t in the hall by the time I had donned my backpack and walked out of the classroom myself. She never turned up, and the dominating rumors were either that she had run away with an older boyfriend or that she had gotten mixed up in some kind of custody thing her parents were going through. I don’t know exactly what happened to her, but whenever I thought of her disappearance, for some reason I thought of Kevin.\n\nThe September after that—September 10, 2013, according to an online newspaper article I bookmarked and look at every year around the same time—the assistant coach of Kevin’s cross-country team also went missing. He left the coaches’ office in his little silver Hyundai in the late afternoon, and no one (*almost no one*) knows where he went next. If Kevin and I had still been friends, and if basement day hadn’t happened, I might have jokingly asked him whether he liked to make people disappear (too soon, I know). But although I didn’t want to admit it, and although reality had a way of obscuring itself in the weeks and months that followed, I didn’t really have to ask Kevin that to know the answer. \n\n\nKevin and I went to different high schools, so he and I no longer had any organic reason to run into each other. Our parents weren’t close, so there was no overlap there, and I ended up spending most of my evenings either being whisked to and from extracurriculars or holed up in my room cramming homework with one half of my brain and texting friends and girls I was talking to with the other. I don’t know where Kevin went to college, or if he even did. I had originally wanted to go out of state for college, but when it came time to apply, I found myself only applying to places within a two-hour radius of home, and even though I did move out, I still opted to live and study nearby. I guess I just didn’t feel right straying too far from the nest.\n\nThis year, September really snuck up on me. Usually my thoughts start returning to Kevin as the tenth day of the month approaches, but this year basement day fell on a weekend, and I was camping with my girlfriend, Petra, in Chabot Regional Park, at a campsite about thirty minutes’ drive from my old neighborhood. We’d started the weekend off with hot dogs, s’mores, a few beers, and even some songs around the campfire, with Petra laughing while she made up words to the parts of “Margaritaville” she didn’t know. That was Friday the 9th.\n\nI didn’t even realize it was the 10th, and what that meant, until Petra and I were in the car on CA-13, heading away from our still erected campsite. Imagine you’re on an old wooden roller coaster, the kind where you climb and climb, higher and higher to where the summit meets the sky, knowing there’s nothing you can do but wait for the inevitable, terrifying free-fall. That’s how I felt in that car, with Petra beside me; that’s how I now know I’ve felt every September 10 for the past eleven years. I don’t know what words my lips formed to get Petra to walk quietly with me along the side of Kevin’s house to his backyard, or if I had to do anything other than lead her there; she had no reason not to trust me. With sick recognition and remembrance, I met Kevin at the backyard entrance to his basement, a plain wooden door flanked by empty, stacked pots and long-rusted gardening tools, where he took Petra’s hand and led her inside.\n\n\nIt’s January now, but I wrote most of this down back in September, thinking, praying that writing it out might help keep me from forgetting next time. Oh god, there will be a next time. Although one part of me has been certain I could never let the memory of what happened *this* September fade, another, stronger part of me is just aching to forget. Needs to forget. I’m sharing this now, because more and more I do crave the unconscious release of not remembering, and at least this way you all can know, and remember, what happened, even if I don’t for a little while. See you next September, I guess.",

        "text": "I could have went ahead and started out by telling you my real name, but I'm keeping it discreet because I don't want anyone, and I mean ANYONE coming for me after the sort of events that unfolded before me last week. I'm taking therapy sessions, but I don't think these images will ever go from my head. They are burned there, like a nightmare which never fades away.\n\nThe whole incident started a week before. I was still in college and pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. Even though I was a bright student, I didn't have enough money to pay my college fees as well as pay the rent. So I started looking for part time jobs. Eventually I was tired of looking as the only jobs I could've got were gas station attendents and waiters. That's when I came across this classified ad about a night guard in a hospital. The pay was really nice, enough for me to pay my rents, give my fees and have extra money. Though I was sceptical of the position and the money, I still applied for the job. 2 days later they told me to come over for an interview. I was surprised that I got the interview right away, but I packed my documents and went for it. The interview was smooth with their main questions being whether or not I was comfortable with spending night outside my home and my health certificate. After reviewing my resume, they accepted me and told me to come to work from tomorrow. They told me that I had to do this job for 1 week straight, and if after that I wanted to discontinue, I would be paid my weeks salary. With that amount of money, I didn't even think of quitting. So I agreed to the contract and decided to come from the following day.\n\nThe hospital was actually an asylum for mentally ill patients, and many brilliant doctors used to work in it. My shift began at 11:00 pm and lasted all the way upto 6:00 in the morning the next day. \"Awfully long\" I thought. I reached at the spot by 10:30 pm and saw the evening shift guard packing his stuff up. \"Hey there !\" I waved at him and went towards him. He looked at me and then adjusted his specs. \"You're that new guy, aren't you ?\" He said and got up from his chair. We shook hands and sat down. \"They paying an awful lot of cash, isn't it ?\" \"Yeah...I need the money.\" I told him. \"Sure you do. Otherwise only chaps with a death wish sign up for the night shift.\" He said. \"Why do you say that ?\" I quickly asked. He was about to answer, but then the alarm rang and it marked the beginning of my shift. \"Well then, it's your time I guess.\" He told and got up with his bag. \"You were telling me something ?\" I asked as he was leaving. \"Tomorrow morning, boy. You won't catch me anywhere around here after 10. G'night, and good luck.\" He said before heading out. \"Weird guy\" I mumbled and sat down on the chair with a sigh. Sure, the hospital did look creepy at night, but the paycheck just dulled everything. I was about to lean back in my chair, when I noticed an envelope lying on the table marked 'urgent'. I opened it and took the paper out. \"Must be instructions for me\" I thought. The letter was written as follows:\n\n\"Greetings, new employee. We are delighted to have you in our company, and we are obliged that you have cooperated with us and agreed to our terms and conditions. Below are some rules which are mandatory for each and every night guard to follow. It's advised to keep this letter with you or have a photo of it in your phone after reading, rather than trying to memorise it. We wish you good luck in your 7 hour journey.\" \n\n1) Your shift begins at exactly 11:00 pm and ends at 6:00 am sharp. You will have to come by the stipulated time and leave only after you have completed your shift. Coming late or trying to leave before your shift ends would result in dangerous situations both in this hospital and to you.\n\n2) After your first hour passes, i.e when it's 12:00 in the morning, you will be visited by a man in a blue overcoat and black fedora. You can see him through the corner of your eye, but never, under any circumstances look DIRECTLY at him. He may ask you to look at him, but just politely respond \"Sorry, but I've been told not to.\" Politely ask if he wants something, and stay quiet untill he says something. He should respond by saying that he wants to meet the patient at bed 13, room 106. Pls note the bed and room number carefully. If he says EXACTLY this, punch a ticket using the ticket machine present in the drawer. If he says anything else other than what is mentioned, answer \"Sorry sir, not allowed.\" You may feel his face changing during your whole interaction with him, but never look at him directly or through any reflection. Don't be fooled by his morphing face. This client of ours doesn't have a face. \n\n3) In the next hour of your shift, you are required to go to the 5 floor of our building and enter room 510. If after entering you see nobody, it means that 'it' has escaped and will be returning soon. Hide in a nearby cupboard or closet and wait till the lights go out again. Once it does, carefully step out of your hiding place and exit the room. Don't make any sound while doing so. Conversely, if after entering the room you see a doctor working on the desk with his back to you, ask him if he needs something. Usually he will need a petty item, such as a pen or something. Place the item he wants in the nearest desk you have. Acknowledge him before leaving. If the whole ordeal goes out without any disturbance, then 'it' is still dormant. Don't bother what 'it' is. Just know that 'it' doesn't like humans.\n\n4) The third hour should pass relatively non-eventfully. You maybe visited by a nurse who would ask you to accompany her to floor 16 . She would give a random reason for that. Ignore it and say you'll send someone else. You don't need to follow her. Our building only has 15 floors.\n\n5) During the fourth hour of your shift, you may feel a little dizzy, and might want to go to sleep. It's highly recommended to stay awake during this hour of your shift. You can listen to loud music in your phone or even use the soda machine near the corridor to buy yourself an energy drink. But do not go to sleep. If you are feeling like you won't be able to stay awake any way, then go inside the guard cabin, lock yourself in, and then go to sleep. But never go to sleep outside your cabin. If you do, you might not wakeup to the same condition you were, or worse, might not wakeup at all.\n\n6) You will be required to go to the 10th floor during the fifth hour. Take the 2nd elevator as the first one would be shown as 'out of order'. The elevator would halt at floor 7. An elderly women would enter it and greet you. Politely greet her back and ask where she is going. If she says a floor number, stay in that elevator and get off at 10th floor. If she says \"I'm going the other way\" apologize to her and step out of the elevator. Don't look at her face while the elevator doors close. Wait for another elevator and board it. \n\n7) After reaching 10th floor, go to the room marked 'O.T'. Knock twice before entering. You would be called inside. Upon entering, keep a straight face regardless of what is happening in front of you. You would feel like screaming or throwing up, but it's highly advised to refrain from such actions as it might disturb the 'doctor' . Ask him he called you and regardless of whatever he says, answer with a \"sorry sir\" and step out of the room. If during this ordeal you fail to keep quiet, run from there as fast as you can. You are to take the stairs while running. The 'doctor' is a relentless predator and would not stop untill it has captured you. If you are lucky, you may actually make it back to your cabin. Enter it lock the door. Stay in there and wait for the hour to pass. Don't worry, the 'doctor' can't enter the cabin.\n\n8) As the sixth and the final hour of your shift starts, you will be visited by another guard saying that your shift is over. The office clock, your phone or any other watch would show 6:00 am in it. Answer him by saying that you would work the extra shift. Your shift is not over. It still has an hour left.\n\n9) Once your shift ends, there will be an announcement saying that the night shift is over.  You may then go home. You have successfully completed your night shift.\n\n\n\"Hope you have carefully read the above mentioned rules, and made a note of them. Failure to follow any of the rules may result in severe physical or emotional trauma, for which the company will not be held responsible. Wishing you a safe and sound night shift. \"\n\n                                      ----------[Redacted] hospitals\n\n\nIt's been an emotionally and physically challenging week for me, and just typing these is making my hands tremble about how I survived that one week, seven hours a day. I followed those rules as diligently as possible. Only once did I fail to follow the 7th rule. I still have nightmares about the scene I witnessed in that O.T. and how that monster who they call the 'doctor' nearly hunted me down and made me a subject in his operation table. After 1 week I quit the job as soon as possible. They paid me all the money they had promised and told me to keep whatever I experienced a secret. Even though they all had smiling faces, I knew the masked threat they gave me. I am sharing this experience of mine as a means of calming myself. To anyone who read this, thank you. You helped me a lot in dealing with my mental condition.",
