        "text": "My first FPS game was Halo 1 on PC, which I played as a kid without knowing anything about optimizing game settings or mouse DPI or anything. I just played with the default Windows mouse settings and a crappy offic mouse and actually got pretty good at the game.   \n\n Later on I started playing TF2 and started reading all this stuff about optimizing your setup to be better at the game. Now one of the first things I saw was people unanimously claiming that mouse acceleration is bad and ruins the game for you. So I followed the instructions, and proceeded to suck at TF2 forever.     \n\nHowever, I still carried the mentality of \"no accel = good\" into other FPS games I played and I proceeded to suck at every single one of them. It has been literally years since playing without mouse accel and I have never come remotely close to being as good as I was at Halo. In fact, I basically suck at FPS now. While I obviously play games less often than I did as kid, I have definitely spent more total hours playing shooters without mouse accel.     \n\nHowever, if I reset my Windows mouse settings and hop into Halo again, I can find some of the same feeling I had years ago, although I am definitely not as comfortable as I used to be since I've gone so long without using mouse accel. You might say it's just because I'm bad at the non-shooting aspects of all the other games but I've tried playing Battlefield with a controller, on PC, and actually did better than with my usual mouse setup.      \n\nNow that I think of it, basically the physical action of aiming in every single FPS I've played since Halo has been uncomfortable for me. The best way I could describe it is like trying to write with your non dominant hand. What the mind wants to do and what the body actually does don't match up. And the irony is I've actually gotten used to writing with my left hand just from random doodling but I've never gotten used to what I thought was the \"optimal\" style of mouse-based aiming even after all these hours of playing shooters.        \n\nDoes anyone have a similar experience or am I potentially schizophrenic?

        "text": "Although I love gaming, starting a new game is often a very tedious effort. In a lot of ways this is because of the complexity of making the game initially compelling.\n\nMaking the first few hours of a game compelling is a pretty difficult task. The developer is tasked with introducing us to a world, showing us the basic mechanics and controls, demonstrating the gameplay loop, as well as alluding to wrinkles that will give the game more depth all within a very short amount of time. This can be especially difficult for longer games, where player progression may take hours to actually take hold.\n\nBecause of these diffictities, I think it is worth it to look at games that nailed their first few hours and examine the reasons why.\n\nHere are some that come to mind.\n\n**Borderlands 2**: One of the biggest criticisms against BL1 was how the first third or so of the game really dragged on due to a lack in enemy variety and locations. BL2 effectively redemies this issue by throwing many interesting enemies at you and funneling you through several environments. You are also introduced to your character specific skill as well as the skill tree as a whole, both of which allude to further wrinkles in the game.\n\n**God of War 3**: Nothing is quite as big of an exclamation point as killing a Greek God within the first 20 minutes of your game. The first few hours of GoW3 demonstrate the games scale and does a decent enough job to show you the basics of combat. More than anything, it empowers you immediately, making you truly feel like a god.\n\n**DOOM 2016**: The first few hours of this game are incredibly well designed to give you clear indications of how the game is meant to be played, while simultaneously drip feeding you with more skills and abilities. The first gore nest in particular is a great microcosm for what DOOM as a whole will play like. \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8xyz97/subnautica_mixed_feelings_about_a_good_game_and_a/",
        "text": "Subnautica is a great game. It's a futuristic survival sandbox that takes place on a vast ocean planet with several interesting locations and intriguing creatures, ranging from small and cute to massive and ferocious. I loved it, I got 25 hours out of it. I didn't really have mixed feelings about it until I started to read about it. \n    \nMechanically, Subnautica is stellar. I feel that the choice not to include many conventional weapons was refreshing because it created a relationship with the world and its inhabitants far more complex than what we see in most games. It forced you to be clever and resourceful, and to know when to run away. It also created a sense of vulnerability that was diminished as you progressed through the game, which makes the player feel like they have grown.\n    \nUnlike a lot of sandbox survival games, Subnautica is not procedurally generated. There is a crafted world and a story. This may not lead to infinite replayability like you see in Minecraft, but it also means the developers had a chance to really develop the world. The different biomes feel great, the story is engaging without being obtrusive or diminishing the sandbox experience. Without wishing to spoil, the pacing is also well done and it seemed like a lot of thought went into the player experience.\n     \nIt's not a perfect game. I encountered some minor bugs and some of the mechanics felt underdeveloped to me, namely the fact that your base could be damaged even though you had few tools to defend it and no real threat--other than your own vehicles--unless you consciously built in a dangerous area. However, at $25 I think it was a steal. I loved it, got over 25 hours of playtime out of it, and if it had been a $60 full price game, I would have still been completely satisfied.\n    \nInterestingly enough, the only issues I have came after beating the game and reading some news about it, and comments from the developer, while searching for mods. \n    \nBefore I go deeper into these topics, I would like to point out that I think you can disagree with someone and still enjoy their art. I don't like this sort of tribalism we see today; the \"you're either with us or you're against us\" mentality where some people feel like they need to distance themselves from people who have differing viewpoints. I may not agree with some of the business decisions of Unknown Worlds or some of the political stances of Subnautica's game director, Charlie Cleveland, but that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy the game or appreciate the artistic decisions.\n     \nFor example, the decision not to include guns in this game was controversial to some. It was deliberate. The game director mentioned that Sandy Hook was one of the factors that they considered, and was even quoted as calling the decision \"one vote towards a world with less guns\". I am a gun owner and a hunter. I, too, want to live in a world with less needless violence--as I'm sure most people do--but I think it's fair to say that I would disagree on what the best path to that kind of world is. \n    \nYet, as I already stated, not including guns was, mechanically, a great decision and it increased my enjoyment of the game. It was possibly one of the reasons that made the game so notable. In most other survival sandboxes, I would have just cleared out every threat until I was the apex predator. In Subnautica, I often found it more expedient to ignore creatures unless they spotted me, and even then I would scare them away over killing them. My friend commented that the wildlife in most games feels like World of Warcraft mobs; they just try to kill the nearest thing. In Subnautica, the animals feel like animals. \n    \nWhat I really have mixed feelings about is some of the reactions that the developer has had to the community. For example, the sound designer, Simon Chylinski, who did a really good job on the game, was fired over comments that he made on social media. There were accusations that the statements were \"hateful\" and at least one outburst directly referenced the game. \n    \nIn response to a very vocal subgroup within the game's community clamoring for a female character, Mr. Chlyinski posted a poll where he asked if players would rather have development time spent on adding a female player character--or--improving the core mechanics of the game and bug fixes. One could argue that due to his position at the company, that he is perceived to represent the views of the company, but I don't think that's giving people enough credit. As reasoning individuals we are capable of recognizing when people are speaking for themselves. It is also notable that about 75% of the responses were in favor of core mechanics and bug fixes over a gender option. Small sample size, charged topic; it's not clear if that poll would be representative of the opinions of the playerbase as a whole, but in a game that takes place 100% in first person and the main character does not speak, it does fit with what my expectations would be. \n    \nOn the topic of a female main character, I do strongly disagree with Charlie Cleveland's position. In response to the perceived community reaction, he tweeted: \"To clear up some miscommunication - I REALLY wish we had made the main character female. We didn’t have time to address that in @Subnautica but I really want to fix that for the expansion (not by a selection screen but by making the player female)\". To me, this smacks of blatant tokenism. Wishing to retroactively capitulate to a minority of vocal players in the most extreme way possible. Arguing inclusivity but wanting to make the character strictly female, not for story or mechanical purposes, not because it fit the artistic vision of the people who worked hard on the game, but simply because he feels that women aren't well enough represented in gaming.\n    \nFor the announced Subnautica DLC, the main character is going to be female. I don't oppose this. Like I said, this is a game that takes place 100% in first person, so it is largely irrelevant. Besides, I play as characters who are not like me all the time. It has never once diminished my enjoyment. I like to roleplay as other people, especially people who aren't like me at all. But I question the motives behind the decision. \n    \nIn regards to the accusations of hateful comments by the sound director, a Kotaku article wrote: \"Twitter users subsequently found many questionable statements in Chylinski’s Twitter feed, including tweets about immigration claiming “importing random ppl from the 3rd world is also importing 3rd world tier crime rates and IQ.” Another tweet mocked a poll on YouTube about gender diversity by referencing attack helicopters, a meme commonly used to make light of transgender issues. Other tweets make light of global pay inequalities between men and women, praise colonialism, or reference “SJW logic.” \n    \nMaybe I'm just cynical, but I get the feeling that if he had said something truly outrageous, the press would have jumped on it and lambasted him over it. To me, this seems like someone with a conservative viewpoint who grew up in the same internet age as a lot of us memeing about controversial topics. It feels like that same small but vocal portion of the gaming community that loves to get offended about things is looking for any excuse to rake someone over the coals for disagreeing with them, and that the developer, regardless of what their motivations may be, are more than happy to oblige.\n     \nI don't claim to know the whole story. Maybe Chylinski is an asshole and he was already on the way out. But what I do know is that I wish gaming could be separate from identity politics. \n    \nI commend Cleveland on one thing, when people complain about things like \"games are too violent\", \"there isn't enough representation in gaming\", my response is usually \"Ok, so make a game without guns. Make a game with a female protagonist.\" And that's what Unknown World did. They made a game--a really, really good game--with no guns. Then they added a DLC with a female character. I may not agree with their motivations, but at least they are incorporating the change that they want to see into their games instead of demanding that everyone else do it.\n    \nI think as members of a capitalist society, we vote with our wallets. But I think it's also important to recognize what you are voting for. I enjoyed Subnautica a lot. I would gladly play more games by this developer if they were as fun and inventive and made with as much care. It is likely that I will pick up the DLC. That doesn't mean that I support of the decisions or views of the developer or the game director. It doesn't mean that I'm picking sides. They made a good game, and as long as the games stay good I'm happy to pay. And that's what I hope for: that political views and shoehorned ideology don't work against the quality of DLC or future games. That Subnautica wasn't just a fluke.\n    \nConsider this one vote towards a world with less identity politics... and more fun.\n    \n**TL;DR:** \n    \nI really liked Subnautica, though I disagree with some of the viewpoints of people who worked on the game. I feel like there is too much identity politics in gaming. Is disagreeing with someone reason enough not to buy their product? Or should we put this aside and judge a person's work by its merits? I lean toward the latter.\n    \nIf you want to see Subnautica or if you want to hear the conversation that started this discussion, you can watch my playthrough: https://youtu.be/ZxbVOz0r_wk\n",

        "title": "What would everyone think of an FPS where every shot was perfectly accurate to the axis of aim, but inaccuracy was simulated by the axis of aim itself moving relative to the screen (i.e. aim indepedent of the axis of vision)?",
        "author": "StevesEvilTwin2",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8xytap/what_would_everyone_think_of_an_fps_where_every/",
        "text": "In a traditional FPS game, your Axis of Aim (AA henceforth) and Axis of Vision (AV) are one and the same. Your gun is always pointing at the center of your field of vision. You look directly at wherever you want to point your gun. Inaccuracy is simulated through spread and recoil. Generally spread causes your bullet to go in a random direction within a cone of fire. Recoil will rotate your AA and AV upwards after every shot, which means your eyes in your *head* will end up looking at the sky due to the force of the gun in your *hands*.      \n\nHowever, what about detaching the AA from the AV? In a traditional FPS your AA is always directly outwards from the center of the screen, so even if there is no reticle on screen, the player can just put a sticker on their monitor and aim with that. If the AA was independent of the AV, then the reticle would be free to move around on the screen and the sticker would not work (given that the reticle still follows the AA exactly).      \n\nWith a free-axis system, instead of having random spread the moment the bullet is fired, you can have the bullets be perfectly accurate to the AA, but have the AA itself be unstable. Assuming there is a reticle, the reticle would be wobbling in a restricted area on the screen similar to how some games have scope sway. The benefit of this system is that a skilled player can compensate for the wobble near perfectly and have perfectly accurate shots rather than having to deal with uninteractable RNG. To simulate the increase of spread that comes with continuous fire, we can either increase the speed of the wobble (making it more difficult to predict) or increase the area in which the AA can move (similar to an increasing cone of fire). While both the wobble and random spread have a factor of randomness, with the wobble, you can see the randomness before you fire and thus can compensate for it whereas spread is decided after you've already aimed.          \n\nSimilarly, with a free-axis system, recoil would be simulated by bumping the AA upwards while your AV would stay the same if you don't move your mouse. Your mouse still controls the AV and AA, so you would compensate for the reticle moving upwards by moving your aim down. The difference is there is a limit to how much you can do this. In a traditional system, you can essentially negate recoil forever provided your sensitivity is high enough or your mousepad is big enough just by continually pulling down. If you tried the same with the free-axis system though, you would eventually be looking at the ground and not be able to see what you're shooting at. This means that recoil as a mechanic will eventually force players to let go of the trigger and let the reticle re-align. This forces players to consider their positions more as it is much more difficult to re-adjust your aim once you've started firing. It also makes silly prolonged spray fights where two players crouch in front of each other and see who is better at pulling down a much less appealing tactical option.       \n\nWhen I was thinking of this system I was mainly thinking of modern military shooters or counter strike style games, but just the spread part might work for more arena style shooters as well (not like arena shooters had recoil to begin with). I admit this is also biased towards mouse and keyboard controls. I'm not familiar with playing shooters with a controller so I'm not sure how well it would transfer to consoles. What does r/truegaming think? Does this system have merit or will it feel like you're fighting the controls too much?",

        "text": "Hey, what’s up guys?\n\nOk, so this is my first Reddit post ever – please, go easy on me. I’ve spent a lot of time on here lurking on people’s posts and I think that it’s my turn to share something with you guys.\n\nI’ve recently been hired in a French Indie Studio that is about to release a game. So I’ve been catching up on a lot of things they’ve been doing until now. And that’s where I’ve realized that the studio has developed a game literally based on players’ feedback. \n\nMagiCats Builder is basically a 2D sandbox platformer that allows players to create their own levels. Nothing new, right? But wait for it. Beside the fact that it’s a beautiful free to play with this intuitive coding interface the real innovation is the whole concept behind it: the game has been developed for the players WITH the players. \n\nOk, let me tell you that during the first week that I worked there, I felt like everybody in our team was able to make games but none of them was into this kind of game nor knew how to work it out! I started freaking out thinking: “There’s no way you’ll create a good game if you’re not 100&amp;#37; into this kind of game. This will never go well - what did I sign up for..?”. Then I tried the game and surprisingly discovered a well done and beautiful game with both funny and technical aspects well balanced. So… How come? \n\nWell, talking individually to my colleagues I figured that there’s no need to be a former Chef to make innovating tasty meals. You just got to know the basics and then let yourself be guided by the taste of your customers. This is exactly what our Indie Studio has been doing for the past 8 months. Through the Early Access period, they’ve been matching the knowledge of our members with the game experience expected by players. \n\nBy the way, I would like to thank all the players involved in gamer communities that help developers and studios finding bugs and more generally improving their games. I think that a lot of companies tend to create games regardless of what people and players want. This is actually sad. And it’s sad because gamers are the ones going to the heart of games. They are the ones games are made for. So why not fully rely on them and produce a video game that will provide them the best gaming experience. \n\nI didn’t know it, but there are several platforms allowing exchanges between players and developers. The studio I work in uses social media, reviews on the different stores we’re proposing our game on and online platforms such as Discord. Punctually they met players in real life during events.\n\nThanks to their feedback, they managed to improve both visual and technical aspects of our game.\n\n**Visual aspects:**\n\nStarting with the most obvious, the game design has been deeply reworked. We kept the main idea the dreamlike atmosphere but changed so much things. \n\nFirst and foremost, the main character: The MagiCats. At first it was a dog but it evolved to something more charismatic, a cat. We went from the little space Corgi to our actual badass Nathan Drake-like epic cat. \n\nThe artistic lead strongly changed too. Thanks to players’ feedback and the devs’ observations, the game got a simple but strong visual identity. The devs integrated graphic rules that help the reading of the game. The environment we started with was too confusing. Because of the outlines, people thought that certain elements were interactive while they were in the background and not supposed to have any interaction with elements on the first plan. We also desaturated the colors and changed them for less flashy ones, so less confusing and more harmonious. As a result, with a desaturated and outlines-free background, elements on the first plan began to stand out naturally.\n\nThe coding interface of MagiCats Builder allowing people to customize their levels got more and more simplified and illustrated to become a more intuitive coding engine. It helped new users interact quite easily with the coding part of the game.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\nThe gameplay of the game evolved according to what players expected. We integrated movements such as the dash or the possibility of hanging on walls for several reasons. The main one would probably be the fact that adding these two abilities made the game more interesting. Dashing and hanging on walls provided players with so many ways to finish levels, which feels so much better gameplay and design-wise when playing tricky levels designed by other players. Also, dashing for whatever reason and hanging on walls are characteristics that the devs believed to be representative of cats.\n\nA multiplayer mode has been integrated too. This one has been requested by our gamer community on every event we did and we kind of rushed to make it happened, but we made it and it works pretty well actually. \n\nBesides that, there’s an upcoming online mode we’re working on, there’s an item we put in the game that reverses the gravity… There are so many things that our studio improved through these 8 months in Early Access that I can’t mention them all. The list simply goes for ever but the result was worth it. The perfect balance between developers’ knowledge and gamers’ expectations ended up in a cute and easy to pick up game.\n\nSo yeah, I would like to thank all gamers involved in such communities. I didn’t know before working here that their point of view could bring so much. I didn't actually realize that some of them could be relevant enough to deeply change the structure of a game.\n\nWell I think that I’m going to stop here. That was my experience, I hope that you guys enjoyed reading it. \n\nTLDR; I started working in a game studio with people not really into the game they were making. But I discovered that their solution to that was drawing inspiration and help from the community, which is something that game studios should be doing more often.",

        "text": "Long time gamer here, but I felt like I should share my story of when I left games for over five years when I became an ultra Christian.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nGames always felt like my biggest love in life, until I became a teenager that is. Even through those adolescent years though I looked forward to metal gear solid with the anticipation of someone obsessed with their hobby, I made sure to follow monthly game magazines and remember how fondly I played my first RPG (Wild Arms) while neglecting my exam studies. After leaving school I had become Christian and ignored games bit not completely. Id still read IGN and Gamespot, and had a ps2 which was chipped (because everyone knows that in the ps2 era there were just too many damn interesting games to buy them all if you were on a college budget).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nAbout halfway through college I got serious about Christianity and dismantled my name cabinet. I don't regret it and it wasn't done out of guilt or anything negative, I just felt it was something I needed to do. I only ended up going back foce years later, no reading, no playing... In fact I remember seeing a demo station with dmc5 and Lego Indiana Jones at a store, and a Wii boxing game, it blew my mind that games had progressed so far beyond where I left them (jak and daxter 2). The moment I came back though was while riding in the back of a truck through Tanzania. I had images of Street fighter 2 in my head, and just those memories put to paper brought me so much joy. It's then when I realized that through the bad times, it's gaming that was my first love, and though things like romance would come and go, even religion with it's all consuming emotion, I'd always carry with me those memories as a child.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nMemories of ghosts n goblins, of yie ar kung Fu, of every Japanese game that found itself at corner arcades and inside of malls. All those hours with the PlayStation and famiclones, I fucking love the inspiration that allowed me a arrogant entitled kid to partake in saving the world and going on epic adventures. Software is the most beautiful gift , enabled by hardware that pushes the limits of course. I'll forever be grateful to the Japanese devs , the unnamed heroes (e.g who made r-type) and those who are not longer around (saturo Iwata, Hiroshi Yamauchi etc). Thanks for reading, time to fly (literally, as I typed this before take off). What are your earliest memories of gaming, do you regret putting so much time into your hobby, or is it something thats given back as much as youve put in? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "We rightfully praise games for streamlined interfaces, quality-of-life improvements, and intuitive mechanics. What about when the designers introduce unpleasant, inconvenient, or annoying parts of the game as part of the game's intended design?\n\nThe typical justification for intentionally inconvenient design is to dissuade reliance on a certain game mechanic and demand a more strategic approach to how players interact with (or avoid) that mechanic. Resident Evil does this with shooting firearms (which is slow and restrictive), Ace Combat 04 does this with resupplying (which is time-consuming and boring). It's the less glamorous cousin of making a mechanic responsive, versatile, and pleasantly tactile in order to encourage its use as the game's bread and butter.\n\nBut I'm more interested in the other ways mechanical discomfort can elevate a game and forward the its purposes or messages. Nier Automata's diegetic interface is used as the basis to interfere with or even strip away control, vision, UI elements, and general situational awareness. These instances of frustration are used to introduce challenges during certain fights or sometimes contextualize plot points as something that have gameplay implications. Flower, Sun, and Rains' controls and puzzles can often be obtuse, cryptic, and downright unfair: all to contribute to the theme of a self-aware lampoon of puzzle-adventure games (perhaps elevating this theme even to the detriment of the gameplay itself).\n\nGames with AI partners or radio support teams will often take these away from you at some point in the game. Sometimes it's for challenging levels designed specifically for your restricted abilities, sometimes it's to force the player to learn their solo character's intricacies in isolation without the distraction of a partner, and sometimes it's just to remind the player how much of an asset the support characters are in-game. It makes sense that the Metal Gear Solid games and their focus on tightly-crafted levels with closely-curated challenges would use this form of inconvenience often.\n\nOn the one hand I believe that video games ought to be fun. If a design decision is made that does not contribute to that fun, it calls into question whether that decision really belongs. On the other hand, I believe that carefully-designed frustration and inconvenience can actually contribute to the player getting a better experience whole. They serve as a powerful tool that developers can use to guide the player to a more engaging and meaningful experience with their game.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What kind of value, if any, do you find in intentionally frustrating or inconvenient parts of games? Examples, whether of this being done remarkably well or horribly, horribly wrong, are welcome.",

        "text": "In my opinion both things should exist, but they should also be separate. Like the review of a movie and the review of the blu-ray release. I remember before heading to the movies with my parents we used to open up the newspaper and, just beside the screenings sections, there was a small piece of commentary from highly important big name critics on new movie releases that we thouroughly read.\n\nFor games, the 'artistic opinion' the reviewer has, if included, is often placed at the end and summed-up in a sentence or 2 before the vote but, much like you wouldn't read a review of a movie that dissected how every action scene or plot point develops before going to see it, watching a review that spends the whole time showcasing the graphics, the gameplay, the story and the soundtrack kinda ruins the surprise of experiencing the game yourself. \n\nMost people that make reviews, even beloved youtubers (I don't really follow them though) like Angry Joe, Jim Stirling, etc. Are just there to scream on and on and on about the bugs, the lootboxes, the graphics etc. which all are objective things and that's fine but they rarely go much deeper than that and it shows, it feels like something's missing. On youtube it's full of videoessays from minor youtubers that explore the meaning of particular games, and I'd love to see full fledged critics with a degree in Classic Studies do the same\n\nI get it, a game is a pretty big investment and that's why the buyer's guide kind of review is needed; however, especially years later, it kinda loses its purpose as usually games go steeply down in price and there're often patches, mods, dlcs, whatnot and the technical value of the game is probably not as important anymore. Infact I personally would like to know who made the game, why, what piece of their own culture inspired them, what they wanted to communicate etc.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that we should treat games as any other piece of art, and we shouldn't just stop at the more pragmatical stuff. Even multiplayer only games can be analized from such a standpoint, of course, because there's always meaning in everything. Do you agree?\n\nEdit: TL;DR I'd like it more if they made critiques alongside reviews",

Read some critiques of the combat online, didn't really bother me much. I bought the DLC shortly after it released, and told myself I'd play it one day when my backlog got smaller.\n\nFast forward to June 2018, I just finished God of War and Bloodborne and decide to myself that I'll give The Witcher 3 DLC a shot.\n\nI got 2 missions in before I gave up. The combat is *sooooo* bad, how did I get through 100 hours of this the first time around? The attacks have no weight to them, there's no substance to it. I feel like I'm doing figure skating moves while I fight, and the limited variety of attacks don't help things either. \n\nThen there's the quest design. Praised in the main game, I felt like the first couple missions I tackled in the DLC had a very formulaic makeup:\n\n-travel to X location\n\n-use Witcher sense to see a bunch of red objectives\n\n-track footsteps or blood trails\n\n-fight monster, quest complete\n\nThat's the majority of quests in The Witcher. That's it. Some may change the location, some may change the monster, but you're going to be doing this for the large majority of your time with this game, and it's unfortunate that they're all of the same exact formula. \n\nAnd I'm not even going to begin how bad the Horse movement is...\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?

It also added a wing-suit to make flying around faster. \n\nYet with all of these additions, it was less fun for me and I never beat it to this day. I personally think they made some things too complicated (such as the rocket boosters) and they require far too much time to set up in the middle of a fight, so i find myself just standing there fumbling with buttons while i'm tanking hundreds of bullets. I also think the addition of the Wingsuit is a detriment, because it takes away any reason at all to get a car or helicopter. You are much more agile and the transitions are much faster. There is almost no downside to using it.\n\nDid you guys feel the same way? Are there any other games that made you feel this way? Where extra content somehow felt like a step backwards?",

We also will be able to work on our [Discord (yeah we have one, join up!!) ](https://discord.gg/N5pFMH) which is much more casual in nature. Expect a squashing of the dreaded list post in the future!\n\n# Speaking of List Posts:\n\nI know a lot of people have been confused about what constitutes a list post and the rules haven't made it very clear, so here's a primitive expansion of the rule:\n\nA list post is anything that attempts to garner what can be boiled down into a collection of something. The standard list post is \"What is your favorite X?\" which is a list post because after people have gone through and commented, you can pick through the entire post and just make a list of everybody's favorite X's.\n\nA common misconception is that a list post should be allowed because people still have great discussion in these posts. It's one of the best parts about this sub, people having deep, quality discussion, but I'm not debating that part. It isn't that list posts produce great discussion, it's that great discussion still happens despite it being a list post. List posts are easy, quick to digest posts that get attention fast, which detracts from the article-quality posts that some of our subscribers put a lot of heart writing.\n\n# Anyways...\n\nAgain, congratulations to the new moderators, it'll be my pleasure to work with all of you for the foreseeable future :)\n\nAlso.. Feel free to ask about anything related to the state of the subreddit, new (or old) moderators, or any other burning questions you might have about anything, ask away!",

I honestly dont know why they are in so many games, I honestly think that games like Battlefield would be more fun without them.",

        "title": "Quick Fortnite rant",
        "author": "topchump",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8x1r78/quick_fortnite_rant/",
        "text": "I feel as though I have to use this subreddit as a chance to soapbox my favorite rant on Fortnite. More specifically why I hate it, but wouldn't tell others not to play it. My backstory: followed the Fortnite (single-player) development since announcement, watched Ster play the (single-player) streamer beta with luke warm reaction, and played the single-player early-access when released.\n\nSo quick timeline here: game is announced in 2011, Ster plays it mid summer 2017, and I start playing in late summer 2017. When I joined single-player Fortnite (prior to being called Save the World) the development of the game was in a dismal state. Highly polished gameplay and visuals were ruined by repetitive questing, terrible micro-transactions, and probably the most complex/awful tag-on RPG systems ever. This game had experience systems for: weapons, traps, skills, playable characters, and non-playable characters. The community was overwhelmingly negative towards the dev team and game state. I suggest you to use the wayback machine on the fortnite subreddit's page, consensus is bad. This was looking like the release of a doomed free-to-play that has been stuck in development hell. Suddenly, the team at Epic takes some of the Unreal Tournament crew to make Fortnite Battle Royale after seeing the success of Player Unknown's Battleground and wanting to do something in a similar vein. \n\nWhen Fortnite BR released in September 2017, I was already pretty upset with Epic and refusing to play anymore Fortnite, or other Epic game. Fortnite BR seemed to me like a blatant copy of a popular game using the dead corpse of a failed title as a show of \"polish.\" And honestly, that's what it is. Fortnite BR filled a market for a polished, interesting, battle royale style game while the leader in the market PUBG was glitchy, and becoming stale.\n\nHere comes the crux of my division of opinion on Fortnite BR: I think the consumer has a right to buy/use the best product available, and PUBG or other clones are not the best on the market. However, I do find it gross how Epic and parent company Tencent has effectively undercut a customer of theirs. PUBG uses the Unreal Engine and relies on Epic for aid with development/licensing. As well, Tencent is the company responsible for the mobile ports of PUBG. It feels as though, while not necessarily illegal, there is a huge moral issue regarding this situation. Epic/Tencent is effectively triple dipping on Battle Royales with licensing fees from PUBG, a better competing game with Fortnite BR, and production of the mobile port.\n\nIn January, PUBG developer Bluehole/PUBG Corp. filed a lawsuit against Epic Games claiming copyright infringement, but the case was closed for undisclosed reasons. Although Player Unknown (Brendan Greene) has been making battle royale style games since 2013, he doesn't \"own\" the game mode, it's been on public consciousness since *The Hunger Games*. However, a precedent that a company selling a product (Epic Games with Unreal Engine), can undercut their customers who use the engine by cloning the game using better resources and likely a better team should be alarming. Fortnite BR feels like an incredibly morally gray area, using a failing game's assets to copy a successful one by a customer, then choking them out legally and financially. It all feels a little gross.\n\nWhat seems most surprising is that Epic has turned around their public perception since releasing Fortnite BR. The BR community loves the changes Fortnite brought to the series with building and a less serious atmosphere. Constant content and developer feedback is a major plus, and even the Save the World portion has started to receive transparency with development roadmaps and increased updates. I think this is a great thing for consumers, with another fun BR game like Realm Royale there seems to be stiff competition in this emerging genre, but I would like to know what you guys think. Should Unreal developers be wary of the way Epic has acted? Does this extend to other Engine providers? Do you feel the same way I do about Fortnite BR or not?\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8ww358/reducing_complex_competitive_games_to_a_web_of/",
        "text": "All “complex game systems” (the game itself, and the design it uses) can be broken down to simplified games. These “simple games” will be referred to as **components** from now on. Each of the 4 main primary components should be represented in any competitive game. In addition to these 4, are 2 variations of primary components, and the 3rd is the variable component — simply just RNG.\n\nA **solution** to a system is the win (or loss) condition state. Each game system is usually unique, and has different solutions even within the same genre. Systems are also asymmetrical, and while you can “solve” individual conditions set by single components the same way between games, the win or loss state of the entire system hinges on the composition of these components, game meta and other game balances unique to each game system.\n\nThe original purpose of this document, is to analyze and look at how difficult it is to design and balance games, and also how many variables are active when competitively playing games. In essence, this was to be a guide for further discussion and deeper analysis. But, enough with all that. Let’s move on to the components themselves:\n\n## Components\n\n### Primary (predictive)\n\n* Tug of War, ToW\n\t* Failures or Successes have a compounding effect.\n * There is always a resource trade-off. Expending energy will lead to fatigue.\n* Cat &amp; Mouse, C&amp;M\n\t* Utilizing all resources to make the best of bad situations.\n * Turns opponent’s strengths in to weaknesses.\n* Rock, Paper, Scissors, RPS\n\t* Conditional concepts and strategies will always beat some,\nwhile also always failing against others.\n* Tag\n\t* Outcomes are decided entirely based on one’s ability to utilize\nthe same exact tools as all other combatants.\n\n### Variable (unpredictable)\n* Random Number Generation, RNG\n\t * RNG as a component is not solved by any other component. It ***solves*** for any of the other components, being used to co-opt other systems.\n\n \n### Variants\n* Keep Away (basically Tug of War)\n * Withholding resources.\n * In this variant of ToW, there is no resource related trade-off.\nBecause of this, after a trade has finalized, everything is essentially reset.\n* Hide &amp; Seek (basically Cat &amp; Mouse)\n * The exception to C&amp;M, is that H&amp;S eventually reverses the roles as a static system, ensuring that everyone eventually has an experience of any role.\n * [Prop Hunt](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135509255), [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/), [Depth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274940/Depth/) &amp; [Evolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolve_%28video_game%29)\n\nComponents can be used to temporary solve short term problems, that don’t directly create a win or loss state for the whole system. Most often, these short term solutions are solved by the component itself, being used by other players. As an example, losing in a simple game of RPS, is most often because of the random strategy of RPS, and not because your opponent figured you out, or was faster. The more games you play against a specific opponent, the more it becomes about C&amp;M.\n\nComponents represent mechanics and strategies within a game, from intended design, all the way to metagame. Getting in to each individual component, we can see that these components can share functionality, as well as be a solution for each other.\n\nThe following details each component, and systems related to them. I want to be absolutely clear on this point though: “Imperfect” **does not** mean “bad” or “broken”. It just means it creates a special case for balance within the entire game system.\n\n \n### Tug of War\nResources &amp; Player Endurance\n\nIn addition to ingame resources, there are several concepts that exist in some form, in every game.\n\nThe player’s own mental, emotional and physical health is an important factor. “Player Health” in this sense, falls under the ToW category, and has a much more potent impact in certain genres over others. This is not something that should be ignored simply because it isn’t designed in to game deliberately.\n\nThe resource of actual Time is also important. A loss solution within a single component may set a player back a few seconds. Or even minutes. The longer this set-back, the greater the impact on the Player’s Health. Some games deal with matches that have a specific Time limit, while others can go on as long as they need to.\nThis dichotomy begins to reveal an interesting pattern we’ll see throughout this analysis\n\nGame (to name a few..) | Player Makeup | Time Limit\n:-:|:-:|:-:\nCounter Strike / Overwatch | 5v5 | Yes\nLeague of Legends / DOTA2 | 5v5 | No\nStreet Fighter / DBFZ / HS | 1v1 | Yes\nStarcraft | 1v1 | No\n\nThere is a greater emphasis on Time loss as a resource in games without a time limit, and that having a greater impact on the players. However, games with time limits, solutions have a greater emphasis on gaining “reads” or direct insight to how your opponent plays.\n\nIn basically all games, there is a loss of time whenever the player dies. However, in most competitive games there is also a resource penalty. The player uses resources to buy gear, units or upgrades. Those purchases, or the resource itself are lost on death. This is true in DOTA2, Starcraft and Counter Strike. Not all games have these additional losses, though. In League of Legends, you don’t lose items or gold when you die. The loss of time in not being on the map gaining resources is quite substantial, but it is not a compounding loss like in other examples. That is the example of **Imperfect Tug of War**.\n\n \n### Cat &amp; Mouse\nMovement, Control &amp; Mind Games\n\nToW isn’t the only component that deals with the player’s capabilities outside of the game. Player Awareness is directly related to where a player is. It’s not just being too close to an opponent at an inopportune time, it’s having the capability as a Player to see and assess situations.\n\nMap control is a resource, and falls under ToW. However, a player’s capability to utilize that resource in positioning is very much a game of C&amp;M. Situation Control, arises from this. Control in general, is a binary system between having or not having it, and gaining control in other areas. Failing to properly make such a trade as a competitive player leads to more and more loss solutions.\n\nA player’s tactics and deception is also in the C&amp;M component, leading to a stronger position and control. I suggest looking up countless resources on psychological “mind games” between players, and general deception and bluffing tactics.\n\nIn most games, you can chalk a loss up to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, in **Imperfect Cat &amp; Mouse**, a loss can come at any moment, regardless of where you are or whatever kind of positional advantages you have. Some games have single instances of giant Area of Effect abilities that can kill opponents regardless of where they are. Call of Duty [killstreaks](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Killstreak) are an example of this as a core feature.\n\n \n### Rock, Paper, Scissors\nCounters\n\nRPS is a widely used and documented component. It is much more grounded within the mechanics designed within the game itself, rather than strategies outside of the game. Later, we’ll talk about RPS examples as they related directly to specific games, so for now let’s just quickly isolate “variants” of RPS.\n\n* Closed Variant: Fire beats Wood, Wood beats Water, Water beats Fire\n* Open Variant: Gun beats Melee, Melee beats Shield, Shield beats .. nothing\n* Cluster Variant: Fire is strong against Wood, Plastic, and Ice.. but is weak to Water and … (this could go on for a while)\n\n**Additional Examples**\n\n* Crowd Control → Cleanse → Silencing → Shielding / Blocking → Bypassing → Buffing (Open)\n* Dodge → Accuracy → Attack Speed-Debuff → Power → Mitigation → Penetration (Open)\n* [Fire Emblem Weapon Triangle](https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/File:Weapon_Triangle_with_Characters.png) (Closed)\n* [Pokemon Element Chart](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type/Type_chart) (the greatest example of Cluster RPS)\n\nVariants of RPS can be used in combination with each other, to further push it’s capability to solve systems. On it’s own, RPS is an extremely powerful system used for solutions. While it’s power is related to the math within a game, it is no more powerful than the other components when within a complex system.\n\n**Imperfect RPS** is where users can choose to override the standard system of balance with varying degrees of restrictions. A player can choose “paper”, but when their opponent throws out “scissors”, you can choose to change to “rock” at the last second. Another way to look at Imperfect RPS, is building up powerful strikes that essentially bypass Closed RPS. This is a system where Fire is never supposed to beat Water, but is capable of being charged up so high that it blasts through that balance. Dissidia uses more of a Cluster RPS system, but the [Bravery System](http://dissidia.wikia.com/wiki/Bravery) is a close example of this.\n\n \n### Tag\nImmediacy &amp; Execution\n\n\nA player with better speed, execution or performance, will edge out win solutions against less capable players. It isn’t just muscle memory to hit button combinations in a fighter, or knowing what units to build and when in an RTS. It’s to utilize the same exact components or strategies your opponent has, but faster or more efficient. Tag is a Base Race in League of Legends. It’s scouting in Starcraft, not dropping combos in a Fighter, and faster reactions in an FPS.\n\nAs mentioned before, it is also a player’s capability to resist negative changes in mental or emotional state during play. The quicker a player tilts, the more endurance they need to build up as a player. Players who train their body and mind, while being healthy and focused, will always perform better than lazy or unhealthy competition. This is the core reason esport teams hire or work with psychologists and physical trainers for their players.\n\nTag, by nature is a real-time system. Which means that **Imperfect Tag**, is turn-based. In many turn-based systems the resource of time, and time limits becomes an important balancing or scoring factor. Hearthstone is an example of Imperfect Tag. However, there is no system which rewards players who play faster or more efficiently, unless we count limited use cards which effect time limits. \n\n## Game Examples\n\nI can’t just stop at talking about these concepts in vague terms. It’s important to go further and analyze specific games, and how specific elements and concepts within those games affect the others. Understand that it takes you less than 10 minutes to read this, but it took me hours to write. The original version of this was written years ago, and only recently revised it over the last week.\n\nIt would take an inhuman amount of time to analyze replays from a healthy amount of games to quantify the observations made here. That, or building a series of games within a sandbox with the sole purpose of collecting data to apply actual numbers to these words. While I am more than willing to do that -- simply dissenting from this concept without actually offering anything substantial or even a dissenting opinion at all, won’t help anyone. It won’t help players talk about balance in the games they love with the developers. It won’t help developers talk about how they want to change and balance a game with their audience. It won’t help new developers even begin to understand how to balance their games. Keep this in mind as we move to the final section of this piece.\n\nAfter a few game examples, I’ll link to a google doc containing a pretty ball-of-yarn-esque [chart](https://i.imgur.com/knrp5TG.png) illustrating how one minor change in one component of a game, throws everything out of whack. This is the information that I think would be important to quantify with actual data.\n\n### Starcraft 2\n\nUnits and Structures are lost when destroyed, being a perfect example of ToW. However, Minerals and Gas can not be lost when any structure or unit is destroyed (unless that unit is carrying the resources), which is Imperfect ToW. The importance of managing your resources (minerals, gas and food) can not be understated, simply because there is a minor example of Imperfect ToW. However, supply block being a ToW component adds to the Tag importance of player execution. That being said, SC2 gets perfect marks for each component of C&amp;M, RPS and Tag. A player’s unit positioning, poke, scouting, unit counters, base management and execution is all fully on display. The importance of ToW, and finite resources means players C&amp;M and Tag has to be exceptional to make full use of every action. Overtime, RPS becomes a kind of second nature, and as opponents learn each other's tendencies, further emphasizes new or unexpected C&amp;M strategies. RNG affects player starting locations (C&amp;M) but overall isn’t used more than that.\n\n### Counter Strike: Global Offensive\n\nWeapons, gear and grenades are all lost on death. Importantly, weapons and some gear (defuse kits) can be picked up by others. Instead of being completely Imperfect ToW, this trading of weapons isn’t as powerful as the player gaining additional overall power. Currency to buy resources isn’t lost on death, creating a varied system of Imperfect and perfect ToW. What is incredibly important however, more so than other games let alone genres, is audio. Being able to hear and react to your enemy’s movements falls under C&amp;M. Position is incredibly important, as there is no capability to teleport or transport yourself between two locations. The decisions you make in C&amp;M components are more important in CSGO, than any other competitive game. RPS is not a defining component, only being applied to certain ranges and varying rates of fire. It can be important, but isn’t game defining. Technical execution is important, but it’s also worth mentioning the component of RNG as Tag, bullet spread from recoil. To be expected in a “realistic” FPS, but it’s also worth mentioning that in CSGO this RNG severity is diminished as it’s predictable muscle memory for players to [compensate](http://csgoskills.com/academy/spray-patterns/). Overall, this doesn’t lower the importance of Tag by much, but does increase resource management of ToW.\n\n### DOTA2 &amp; League of Legends\n\nWhile there are many similarities between DOTA2 and League of Legends, key differences shift the way each game works mechanically. League of Legends has Imperfect ToW, where there is no direct loss of resources (gold) on death. This lowers Tag requirements for success. DOTA2’s courier can be seen as a ToW resource, while microing it increases Tag requirements for success. In League of Legends, the C&amp;M of changing your position with Flash, Teleport or Recall is (potentially) freely available to everyone, while in DOTA2 it must be bought as a resource, further increasing ToW importance. Both games require excellent C&amp;M from players, but the ease of repositioning yourself in League is important to keep in mind. Both games handle the component of RPS similarly, with League leaning a bit harder in to Closed RPS in regards to character matchups. Overall, both games layer the variants of RPS in terms of characters, abilities and combat stats fairly equally. In regards to Tag, both games reward player execution equally as well, in regards to targeting, skills and attacking. However due to the differences in ToW and C&amp;M, the importance of Tag is wildly different between the two games, and drastically changes strategies teams employ for victory to accordingly focus on the most important components.\n\n \n### Fighting Games\nStreet Fighter (series), Smash (series), Mortal Kombat (series), Dragonball FighterZ, Tekken (series), Soulcalibur (series), as well as literally dozens of more..\n\nToW is Imperfect in most all fighting games. However, this shifts importance to C&amp;M and Tag, while RPS is powerful on it’s own. Health (ToW) is often used like a resource in any other game to get in and gain a position (C&amp;M) advantage on the opponent. Poke, “footsies” and spacing (C&amp;M) between you and your opponent further boost the importance of RPS and Tag. While RPS is less important in some games than C&amp;M and Tag, it’s still worth mentioning exactly what is going on with the component. Frame data, and hit/hurt boxes creates a deeply complex web of closed and open RPS. This degree of depth makes fighting games difficult to learn, but often not reliant on RPS as the only means to success. Players who are more technical (Tag) or have better “mind games” (C&amp;M) will still being using the same RPS as everyone else, just.. better. This is why C&amp;M and Tag edges out over RPS in fighting games. It’s not that it (RPS) isn’t important, or even what most people think of when talking about fighting games, it’s that concepts related to execution and position are that much more important. Reacting (Tag) to your opponent sticking out the wrong normal at the wrong time, is an opportunity to punish (RPS) with the correct counter. Being at the right distance to bait opponents, or varying your attack patterns to keep the opponent guessing. Most pro players, don’t have the entire game’s framedata (RPS) memorized. This is why apps and tools are so frequently used to remind players of certain details in the metagame. They instead choose train and improve on their C&amp;M and Tag dominance.\n\nThese are just a few examples of complex systems. This doesn’t begin to go in to the ease of C&amp;M movement in Fortnite or Overwatch’s unique map (ToW &amp; C&amp;M) variances among many other examples.\n\nTo see more breakdown in components themselves, as well as the effects it has on a system in whole, you can see this full doc on [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17BuMUaPVksKFHN8Kaxzts9CxV8KaJTtjsTJ8H9UNNG0/edit?usp=sharing#heading=h.6rcgtto8f0xj).",

For example, God of War 4 post game has a winter setting post game with a very understandable reason. Horizon Zero Dawn's DLC is called \"The Frozen Wilds\" and is very snowy. Assassin's Creed Syndicate's DLC, Jack the Ripper, has an snow effect on screen always. It seems odd to see such an effect out of nowhere, but I really like it because it shows something new on the screen. Does having a winter environment in a game symbolize anything for you?",

        "text": "The intro to Axiom Verge had my eyes rolling so far into the back of my head that I saw my brain. The game starts as every single \"retro\" indie game starts, a low-resolution, low screen size cutscene featuring NES reminiscent pixel art, text instead of voice acting, and a cheesy sci-fi setup. Do YOU remember the 80s? These devs sure do. Coming to you from the people who played Metroid, it's Axiom Verge! I've gone through this song and dance so many times with so many games. Main menu with UI reminiscent of Zelda NES. Intro cutscene with generic, boring plot you don't care about, tinged with an ugly 80s retro aesthetic.\n\nThe start of the game is explicitly the same as Metroid. Or, not really the same, unlike Metroid there's boring, uninteresting dialog to click through that is boring and uninteresting because it's setting up a vague mystery about two characters I know nothing about. You start on an elevated platform with an upgrade to your left, like Metroid. The screen transitions are the same as Metroid. The first enemy you encounter is a less iconic zoomer. The second enemy you encounter is a wholesale ripoff of the flying creatures from 1 and Zero Mission. The third enemy you encounter is a hive from Zero Mission. These devs don't seem to have an original bone in their body.\n\nAfter 8 minutes, I'm completely done with the game. There's limitless potential for a new take on the idea of Metroid, even one done in the retro aesthetic. And instead of making something new, they just made Metroid with the bland stock indie game presentation thrown onto it. This game brought me back to the horrible years of indie games, where everything was just a bad remake of an NES/SNES game but with a gimmick added onto it. But as far as I can tell, Axiom Verge doesn't even have a gimmick.\n\nWhy did this game get good reviews? I mean, I guess it's completely playable, which is better than most indie games on Steam, but still, it's just a worse version of what we already have. Why do people like it?",

Now 2 years later, Hitman 2(otherwise and initially called Season 2) has been revealed. It's expanding on pretty much every factor of Season 1 - levels seem to be even bigger(Season 1 levels being huge themselves), less triggers and more open style gameplay, the animations being improved along with the new ones. \n\nBUT. It's on the same engine(Glacier 2) and has the same animations. Visit any place of discussion except r/HiTMAN and Hitmanforum and you'll see the phrases 'There's nothing new, everything looks the same!' and  'It's the same game with a reskin!' posted almost everywhere.\n\nThe exact same thing is with AC: Odyssey - same engine and animations but new content working on the framework established by the prequel Origins. The comments are the exact same, even more in comparison with Hitman 2. You'll see everyone calling this 'same as Origins nothing new' almost everywhere.\n\nThere are even more examples like - \n\n\nFar cry 4 which provided a bigger map with more outposts, a new story and improved on the brilliant mechanics of 3 whilst adding new ones,\n\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided with more augs, bigger levels, expanded dialogue system and mechanics, especially the cover system,\n\nSniper Elite 4 which expanded on the size and quantity of levels from 3 aside from lots of new content like weapons and multiplayer modes\n\n\nAnd the list goes on. All of the above games offered new content expanding on the established framework put up by their prequels and using the same engine, animations and assets but got negative reception for the latter and (most probably) lost a few sales for this reason.\n\nWhat're your thoughts on this?",

        "text": "INSIDE has an amazing, pseudo-realistic yet vibrantly fantastic aesthetic that clearly shows a mastery of Unity and 2.5D environments by the developers. It also, like LIMBO, has an impressive aray of visual shaders and effects, and a gorgeous ambient soundtrack. For these reasons alone, the game is worth playing. The game has far less interesting puzzles or even puzzles in general than LIMBO, but most of the time this is acceptable and doesn't detract from the experience. \n\nHowever, INSIDE's story is a curious subject. In many ways the narrative is the strongest and yet most detrimental part of the game. It shares many of the problems and strengths of LIMBO's story, whilst amplifying the positives and at the same time the negatives. Both stories are EXTREMELY vague and ambiguous. They supply the player with a large array of visual storytelling and powerful imagery, evoking countless questions whilst answering none of them and encouraging the audience to draw their own conclusions. In a sense, it's really the player who creates INSIDE's story; Playdead only provides a writing prompt. \n\nThis approach is a double-edged sword to the extreme. The lack of any definitively cohesive plot creates an atmosphere that is all build-up and no payoff. The tension and excitement along the way is superb, but without a conclusion it all ends up spilling over. I was left with a strong sense of dissatisfaction and only a few disconnected ideas about what I had just witnessed. If you're looking for a potent story to cozy up to with hot chocolate and a warm blanket, INSIDE probably isn't for you.\n\n[](#s \"There is one major flaw in INSIDE that replaced my dissatisfaction with anger. Once all secrets are collected, the player must backtrack to a previously locked door and manipulate the directional lever beside it to play out a fairly long tune. This Konami Code-like puzzle is an appaling display of bad design and so alien from the rest of the game that it seemed like the developers temporarily abandoned their senses.\")\n\n[](#s \"While bad enough as a concept at all, this code is as far as I know only acquirable playing very faintly in the background of one of the previous secrets- BEFORE the secret is acquired. Once the door is opened, the player is treated to a short and generic cutscene where the protagonist performs an action so ambiguous as to imply practically anything one could dream up. Compared to LIMBO's wonderful secret puzzle full of interesting concepts and difficult platforming, this \"secret\" was an insultingly simplistic waste of time and a missed opportunity.\")\n",

I remember the characters being cute and childish, but every female toon in this game (save for the teenies) is busting out of her clothing. The Nymphs went from maybe 90% clothing coverage to the inverse, and are also preposterously curvy and buxom. I've found exactly one post online detailing this and I find that odd. \n\nThen there's the bubblizing. This has never been prominently featured in a Rayman game other than Origins and Legends, I'm guessing. If you're familiar with weird sexual fetishes, you've heard of inflation. As it's presented in Legends, I assume it's not playful artistic choice and is instead an artist fulfilling their fantasy in a game accessible to people ages 10+ which is super creepy to me. Characters wearing skirts have their panties revealed when they bubble, shorts stretch to show panty lines, their breast curvature covers half of their face. Obviously I cannot find people discussing this online because if you Google it you'll get a dozen pages of erotic results, since that's clearly the intent of this choice.\n\n\nSo what happened? Artists or creative dev leads thought they could sneak it in? Devs got older and thought of their game as aging up with them? Would love to hear your thoughts, as I can't find anybody discussing it.",

        "text": "I don't play FPS games much, especially competitively, so I don't know much about them.  I do play fighting games and RTS, though.\n\n\nWhen it comes to FGs and RTS, there's a lot of game mechanics that can affect the competitive viability / enjoyability of a game.  For example, the Ultra attacks in SF4 were activated once you took a certain amount of damage, leading it to be sometimes derided as \"a reward for losing\". and anti-competitive.  Or Guilty Gear's \"Roman Cancels\" were praised as something that adds skill and depth to the game.\n\n\nOn the flipside, there's a lot of praise for how Starcraft has very different construction mechanics for each faction, giving a great amount of interesting variation in gameplay.  Or other RTS examples might be how damage and amour types are simulated, the resources and how they are gathered, etc.\n\n\nWhen it comes to military shooters, though, there aren't normally very much abstract game mechanics as far as I know?  Shooting, reloading, running, crouching, etc all work fairly similarly between different games.  Please educate me if I am ignorant about this.\n\n\nThe only opportunities for different mechanics seem to be the \"match rules\", ie. victory conditions, how capture points work, how respawning works etc.  I'd like to exclude those for now, and just talk about game mechanics for the moment to moment combat.\n\n\nDo military FPS games actually have differences in combat mechanics that aren't obvious to an outside observer like me?",

        "text": "This is just a post about Detroit: Become Human and David Cage. Criticisms and praises.\n\nSo, David Cage is basically a meme at this point. Because he delivers these games that are ambitious and have unique ideas, but usually come with these sort of on-the-nose, sort of ham-fisted moments. But as time has gone on, his games *have* gotten better in my opinion. But my question is this: Is David Cage holding his own projects back?\n\nI'm so torn because I feel like this has got to be the very first true big budget game where your choices matter. Like on the level of Undertale, but with the hassle of mocap and voice acting and making new expensive scenes that half of players will never see.\n\nI've heard several people say that David Cage absolutely *did not* like the Connor and Hank story because there was \"too much improvisation\" by the actors. It's also no surprise that the Connor / Hank story came out the best and the least on-the-nose of all the main characters. I feel like David Cage just absolutely needs someone to balance him out and say \"Hey. You have 5 great ideas for this part, but this one idea that's part of it is really kind of stupid\". \n\nThe Marcus story was so purely David Cage. I don't even have to look it up to know. Odd fixation on Neo from the Matrix? Check. Characters that are sort of one-note (Like Leo, the school special drug addict). But it still works at times to me, regardless of how many \"super cool coats\" Marcus amazingly finds, and all the very Cage-esque moments. \n\nThe Kara story was overall minor, but it did have some very sort of goofy moments. Like a twist or two just not making much sense. And judging how you go down the story, it can get very on-the-nose as usual. But even down that path, I actually think it was somewhat enjoyable. I think all the stories were, really. (Also shout out to Luther. I'm sure a lot of people didn't have him in the playthrough, but the actor was awesome.)\n\nIndigo Prophecy was just so amazingly fully of bad ideas. I know some people think it's this amazing game, but I think if they took a closer look at what's actually happening in the game, they'd see what I mean. Maybe they played it when they were younger, or maybe the good outweighed the bad. \n\nAlso the weird kind of sexual undertones are still plenty, though less prevalent in this game.\n\nI sort of feel like every game Cage has done is better than the one before (personally), and I wonder if it's due to him having to answer to more people. Omikron, his first major game with David Bowie is just... it's so bad that it's not even worth it to play it for jokes if you ask me. Indigo has so many goofy ass moments, and the simon says mechanic is so ridiculous. Where the story starts with an interesting pace, it quickly turns into a fanfiction that a 10 year old wrote at times. Heavy Rain was the first big one for most people, and though the story doesn't really stand up to me for several reasons, it was just so cool to see a game that had such a focus on the narrative. I think Beyond Two Souls actually worked out well until the whole super marine kind of stuff. There always just seems to be a point in these games where Cage wants to shoot things or be Neo.\n\nI'm optimistic to see what David Cage comes up with next though, actually. Detroit was one hell of an impressive feat, and it's nice to see things being toned down. I wonder if we'll see any other games trying to take this one at some point. The level of complex paths.",

        "text": "Hi r/truegaming,\n\nA few weeks ago I posted asking people to participate in a survey for my Masters project. Thank you to everyone who took part. As promised, here’s my results.\n\nSo first, a bit of demographic stuff. In the end I got 3576 responses, with is incredibly. What’s even more amazing is that only 37 of those weren’t usable for one reason or another.  In total 2950(83.36&amp;#37;) of the responses were male, 512 (14.47&amp;#37;) responses were female, 66 (1.86&amp;#37;) identified as “other”, and 11 people did not respond (0.31&amp;#37;). In total, 1664 (47.02&amp;#37;) of respondents were from the United States, followed by 403 respondents for the United Kingdom (11.39&amp;#37;), 217 (6.13&amp;#37;) from Canada, 157 (4.44&amp;#37;) from Germany. A total of 39 respondents left the question about country blank, and a total of 87 other countries make up the remaining 31.02&amp;#37;. 2309 (65.24&amp;#37;) respondents played alone, while the remaining 1230 (34.76&amp;#37;) played with others. The majority of those played with others online, with 1090 respondents doing so, or 88.62&amp;#37; of respondents playing with others, and 280 respondents playing with other playing in the physical world. Some respondents played other people both online and in the physical world.\n\nThe aim of the survey was to see how two previously validated questionnaires work together. The questionnaires were the Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ), and the Player Uncertainty in Games questionnaire (PUGS). The theory was going in that the scores would correlate in an inverted-U shaped curve, so as the immersion score increases, the uncertainty score increases, until about half way when the immersion score should start decreasing while the uncertainty score continues to increase. I thought this as too much uncertainty should make a game unenjoyable.\n\nHowever, this wasn’t the case, and there’s just a steady, slight linear correlation. Which is great as the theory’s partly right, immersion does increase as uncertainty increases, however it’s also interesting that there’s no drop at all.\n\nThank you True Gaming for helping me.",

        "text": "I absolutely love gaming, but even though I've been playing since the days of Pong, I'm not that good at most games and get easily frustrated by having to do the same things over and over to get past some part of a game. I don't have the reflexes that many others have, except for in racing games. \n\nSo, I tend to play games on easy. I don't think there's anything wrong with people liking more difficulty, and they enjoy bashing on something until they get past it, but that doesn't translate as fun to me. \n\nFor me, I love a detailed, rich, vast open world I can explore and discover hidden things. I love being surprised by details that developers take the time to tuck away for inquisitive people. Having exploration rewarded somehow is very fulfilling. I also love having my choices affect the world in a very perceptible way. \n\nI don't like games where you're constantly under attack and having to fight.  I'm bored by pure shooters and am not very competitive, so I have no drive to pwn anyone or climb leaderboards or complete achievements.\n\nExamples of games I really love are The Witcher 3, most Elder Scrolls games, No Man's Sky, GTA V, Subnautica, Lone Echo, and Dragon Age Inquisition.\n\nAny others here that feel similarly about gaming difficulty? What makes a game really fun and/or engrossing for you? Let's hear what fulfills you in a game and what games do that for you!\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a trend here and I think you guys have helped me understand why I'm not into difficult games! A lot of you are saying you used to enjoy the challenge, but as you got older you want to enjoy the experience. That makes sense. When I was a kid, I'd be in the arcades and there were kids there who were always there and were all about mastering the games and I didn't have the money to go there every day after school and just play for hours at 25 cents a pop. So, I never had the chance to \"git gud\" because I couldn't play enough to do so, and I'd get stomped every time when playing against others. So, I played Dragon's Lair, Thayer's Quest, and once we had a computer at home, Ultima IV. Plus I loved text adventures. I guess that feeling just kind of stuck. ",
