Psychedelics (the mushroom) cause people at-risk for diseases like Alzheimer's or schizophrenia to lierally break, yet we do little to provide resources or give them help so they don't turn to drugs, and they die. Immersive psychological horror experiences or even just regular media like 13 reasons why have caused deaths much more directly by triggering people. None of this leads to change, to warning labels, to anything, because people who don't get caught in the cross fire still want the experience enough to pay for it.\n\nThe truth is, when we start testing neural implant technology for real, there are very likely going to be dozens of Coopers -- willing participants, \"informed\" of risks, duped into tests to make a little money, and left dead by an unknown risk factor, or an electrical surge, or cell phone interference. If they had gotten his family medical history, seen the Alzheimer's, he never would have been allowed to use the mushroom. But, he, like so many in our world, falls through the cracks on the road to SaitoGemu's next quarterly report.",

Spoilers(ish) ahead because some of the themes have to do with the twists that occur in the respective episodes. I think you could group them by\n\n**Setting:** \n\n(1) Current world (same societal rules, current tech drives the episode)\n\n(2) Slight future with particular new tech (same societal rules, new tech drives the episode)\n\n(3) Distant future (dystopian future with totally different societal rules, episode draws comparison to our current society)\n\n**Overarching Theme:**\n\n(1) \"We're obsessed with social media/gawking.\"\n\n(2) \"Humans are capable of horrible things, tech makes it easier or drives us further.\"\n\n(3) \"If you try to recreate someone or clone their mind it will have unexpected consequences.\"\n\n(4) \"Our initial impressions of someone can be completely wrong.\"\n\nYou can basically assign every episode to each of these categories, though I'll admit I have about 5 left to watch, mostly from the earlier seasons. A few episodes, especially in seasons 3-4 (when they've exhausted the themes alone) tap into two lessons, especially the human nature because that's a central theme of the entire show. Some of the ones that fit this scheme:\n\n|Episode|Setting|Theme|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|The National Anthem|Current World|Social media/Human nature tech|\n|Fifteen Million Merits|Dystopia|Human nature driven further by tech|\n|Be Right Back|Slight future, new tech|Recreating someone|\n|White Bear|Slight future, new tech|Human nature/Initial impressions|\n|Nosedive|Dystopia|Social media|\n|Playtest|Slight future, new tech|Human nature driven further by tech|\n|Shut Up and Dance|Current world|Human nature/Initial impressions|\n|San Junipero|Slight future, new tech|Recreating someone|\n|Men Against Fire|Dystopia|Human nature driven further by tech|\n|Hated in the Nation|Slight future, new tech|Social media/Human nature|\n|USS Calister|Slight future, new tech|Recreating someone|\n|Arkangel|Slight future, new tech|Human nature driven further by tech|\n|Crocodile|Slight future, new tech|Human nature driven further by tech|\n|Hang the DJ|Dystopia|Social media/Recreating someone|\n\nJust some thoughts, but I think this holds up. Obviously you could do this with slightly different themes. You could add or subtract categories, but after seeing the \"starter pack\" I thought it would be fun to go through a see what I could draw from this.",

Probably not what the writers meant but would be an interesting point if true.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Apparently the writers have hinted at a sequel and I'm looking forward to it if that's true.

        "text": "[https://www.netflix.com/title/81000509](https://www.netflix.com/title/81000509)\n\nIf you're looking for a Black Mirror fix, *On Children* is a Netflix Original Taiwanese Anthology series that seems to be heavily inspired by Black Mirror. It includes similar premises and (the first episode at least) involves a destructive piece of technology and it's extremely dark. Each episode is a standalone story.\n\nThere are however a couple of key differences.\n\nFirstly, the show's focus is much more on paternal, familial relationships, and the pressures of youth. Since the series comes from Asia, where scholastic pressures are much much higher than in other parts of the world, this is what it seeks to satirize. Because of this the Science Fiction aspects take a back seat, but are the vehicles it uses to satirize Asian culture similar to how Black Mirror uses its Sci-Fi elements.\n\nSecondly, the show branches out from Science Fiction, into more fantasy/magical realism elements in several episodes. The first episode, however, is indistinguishable from a Black Mirror episode if it wasn't for the fact that it's in Mandarin and was shot in Taipei.\n\nThirdly, the episodes are all 90-100 minutes each, however they still have a personal, small-scale, feeling that keep them from feeling like feature films.\n\nAs far as my personal opinion goes, I was blown away by the first episode and recommend it to any fan of Black Mirror, only four more to go! Enjoy!\n\nEdit: Just finished watching the second and third. The second episode is a lot more abstract and leaves several open questions, it's worth a watch in my opinion, but is a little bit of a hard pill to swallow if you don't like abstract storytelling. The third episode is basically a Black Mirror episode, so you guys will probably like that one a lot. I'll continue to update this post with my opinions on the final two episodes.\n\nEdit 2: Episodes 4 and 5 were fucking excellent. I now consider this a must watch for basically anyone. It's an impressive piece of work. Below are my final episode rankings for anyone interested.\n\n1. ADHD is Necessary\n2. Mother's Remote\n3. Peacock\n4. The Last Day of Molly\n5. Child of the Cat\n\nHappy Watching!",

        "text": "By the first plot I'm referring to the device where the doctor could feel the sensations of other people. I think a \\~ 45 minute episode where it would start out as him having trouble with patients, he would get talked into the device, then the middle section of the episode showing all the benefits (helping patients, better sex life, etc) and then with 15-20 minutes left have the death experience which would give him the craving for pain (I assume the reasoning behind this is that things that cause pain generally lead to death and his body wants to feel that rush of endorphins from the death experience so his body wants him to feel pain) and show him spiraling slowly and then the most extreme part of the twist be where he would finally start gruesomely mutilating his own body and then the end could be where he killed the homeless guy. \n\nI'm personally someone who didn't love Black Museum (didn't dislike it either, just wasn't super impressed) but I thought this plot line was really interesting and if it had the time of a full episode to explain the plot further and have more details could be a really interesting story (especially since a device like that would have serious benefits). I dunno, just my two cents. ",
