She is ok with learning buttons, steaming etc. but she most definitely won't get a scale out every morning and weigh her shots nor flush the group like on a HX machine etc. so some sort of programmability would go a long way.\n\nThese are the machines I've been looking at. Although full disclaimer, I may end up going with a Breville Dual Boiler as they're only $1,000 in Australia. But I prefer the look of the more \"prosumer\" machines.\n\nLelit Elizabeth PL92T - $2,550\n\nRancilio Silvia Pro - $2,600\n\nAscasa Steel Duo PID - $2,630\n\nBellezza Bellona - $2,680\n\nProfitec Pro 300 - $2,900\n\nRancilio Silvia Pro X - $3,000\n\nQuick Mill Sunny - $3,400\n\n**The Quick Mill is pretty expensive but if it's a great machine that my wife would enjoy using the. I could probably justify it.",

My ratio was 1/10.4, which was ideal. I go coarser but in this time, it was not delicious as my first try. Later, I went to my first grinder setting, but I decreased my coffee amount by 0.5 gram.

It won't quite fit it all in one pour but if you bloom 50g around 45 seconds it should all go right up to the lip.\n\nDraw down takes around 4 minutes. When it stops dripping you can insert the plunger and push down an inch or so to push the remaining water out of the cake.\n\nI'm surprised how well it works. I have the same beans the coffee shop uses and there's virtually no difference between the AeroPress and their zero bypass brewer.\n\nI haven't tried a single filter brew yet but I imagine the draw down will be to quick and produce a weaker cup.",

I buy a light roast from a local cafe, dial it in on my Baratza Encore which I clean monthly or whenever I try some new beans, use an electric kettle with temperature control (usually 200 F), brew in an Aeropress (13g grounds, 250g water, swirl 5-8 times, brew for 3 minutes, break crust, press), and let my coffee cool for a bit before drinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've varied my brew time, grind size, water temperature, press speed, coffee ratios, used multiple filters, added ice to cool it down, and nothing I do makes my coffee taste really great. It's fine, honest. It's not excessively bitter or sour, not overly astringent, nothing obviously wrong with it. It's just not particularly amazing. I thought maybe it was the coffee, so I tried a washed, single-origin Ethiopian bean and I got similar results. Recently I went to the bay area and picked up a bag of Solano Roast from Souvenir Coffee Company (they make really good coffee for anybody near Berkeley or Albany and staff some really knowledgeable people). When I had it in the shop, it was a wonderful combination of floral and fruity notes with a nutty undertone. I often perceive flavors as colors, and it came out as splashes of lavender and pink over a substrate of a gentle transparent brown. To this day, it is the best coffee I have ever had. I took a bag home, and none of that was there no matter what I tried. In fact, every coffee I try at home tastes kind of the same: some fruity or acidic notes with this sort of generic chocolaty taste. It's just kind of whatever. Not great. Not terrible. Just kind of... okay I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the Encore isn't the best, but surely it can at least make a good cup of Aeropress coffee? I've got clean filtered water that I get out of an under-sink filtration system, weigh out all my ingredients to within a few percentage points of my target, and always keep time.

The issue I'm having is that the grinder hold around 1-2 grams of coffee inside the grinder when used. I have it a setting for pour over coffee with granuals around the size of coarse sea salt. I also use the wet spoon method to try and give rid of static as well. When looking up the chute, it appears the coffee is forming a plug at the 2 'de-static' bars that are inside and I have to use a small rod to unclog the machine. Any tips on how to relieve these symptoms or how to remove the static bars?",

        "text": "I am curious to hear from other people who have used at least two highly-rated brewers. I have had three: The OXO 8-cup, the Bonavita BV1900TS, and the Breville Smart Brew Pro. I would describe them as follows:\n\n1. Bonavita BV1900TS - Dead simple to use and gets the water hotter than the others. You can run a cycle with a bloom or not. Flat bottom brew bed almost always comes out looking good. Coffee is excellent. Carafe is annoying. There is usually and ounce or two that doesn't pour through the lid and the lid is a separate item than the brew basket and must be added after brewing.\n2. OXO 8-cup - Also simple but set up to use two different modes, small batch and large batch. This involves two different filters. We typically make \"4 cups\" at a time, which is the top of the small batch. The machine does not heat water up to the same temp as the Bonavita, so we have to grind finer (15 vs 18 on my Baratza Virtuoso) and that can cause the bed to touch the shower head during brewing. Not ideal. Carafe is slightly better, especially because it brews through the lid into the carafe. \n3. Breville Smart Brew Pro - Lots of options and settings, but we did not have a good experience with this machine. We did have a refurbished unit, so that could have been at the heart of our issue (I tried too long to figure out how to make it work, so it was too late to return it for another one. Breville claimed that the problems I noticed did not rise to the level of defective.) For us, the unit did not get anywhere near hot enough unless we brewed over 24 oz (topping out at 175-180 degrees). We don't drink that much, so we ended up negotiating to return it for store credit. My wife was very sad, as she liked the look, the feel (little things like the brew basket and carafe clicking into place), and the programability. I really wanted to like this machine, but it just let us down (even in single-cup mode at 208, the coffee was lukewarm in the carafe). Looking at reviews, some people seem to have great units, and others don't.\n\nSo, who has used a few machines, and what do you think? I am still in the market for an and-game machine with programability, options, durability, and the best coffee. With respect, please only comment if you have used more than one good machine, as the comparison is what I am after.",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI have been struggling with our Bonavita BV1900 for a couple of years or so. It has the common problem of stopping a brew halfway through the cycle. The common suggestion I have found online and through this sub has been to up the descaling, which I found worked poorly (for a day or two), if at all.\n\nI was able to find a solution that has worked really well so far (for at least 10 brew cycles with no problems). It's kind of simple, but it just means taking the machine apart and cleaning the tubes that connect to and from the heating element. The tube that connects the reservoir and the heating element is especially problematic because it has a curve and an internal spring that prevents it from kinking, but it gathers gunk.\n\nI wrote about this in a blog post here with photos: [https://www.mentalhalf.com/bonavitarepair](https://www.mentalhalf.com/bonavitarepair) which I hope I am allowed to link to. I had some affiliate links on my site which are dead. I am not trying to make money, just help people find this repair, as it was very frustrating for my family.

        "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nI posted this on the espresso sub as wel but I figured you all are just as knowledgeable. I have a BBP Semi-Automatic espresso maker ($1,000 or so), and a Gaggia Brera super automatic ($450). I used the same beans in both. When I use the Breville Barista Pro, the taste is fantastic, but it gives me Esophagitis every time. When I use the Gaggia, the taste is no where near as bold, rich or complex, and I have no GI distress.\n\nSomeone suggested trying some paper filters in the Breville to absorb irritants and I’ve ordered a pack, but I’m wondering if anyone else has any ideas why this would be? The bean I use is low acid (ph 6.8), dark roast. I don’t think acid is the problem anyway. There has to be something the “real” espresso maker extracts that the Gaggia doesn’t. I’m almost tempted to try a light roast coffee just to see what happens. \n\nNote: I’ve tested this several times, and it’s definitely the Breville. For some reason coffee fans first reaction, despite about 20% of the total population being unable to tolerate coffee is to say “it’s not the coffee,” but I assure it is. It’s just strange to me that my super automatic sits fine and my semi causes me problems.",

        "text": " Hey! So I’m pretty much disgusted with how bad Google Reviews / Tripadvisor / Yelp are for discovering great coffee shops (by great I mean coffee shops which locals love and go to regularly). I travel a lot and I always try to find cool community-oriented cafes with a great vibe and good coffee. Sometimes, I travel to a different city just to see what the coffee culture is like in the area. What can I say, it’s an obsession.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the apps I’ve tried so far were good. Especially Google Reviews, Tripadvisor, and Yelp. Is it just me or it is actually impossible to find good local coffee shops there? They are usually lost in the endless lists of touristy restaurants and mainstream venues. And I’m not even talking about finding certain categories of cafes, like coffee shops which are good for remote workers, for specialty coffee, etc. The best way is probably asking locals but that’s often difficult as you need to find people who like same things as you.\n\nI also enjoy meeting new people. I know I could use Tinder or Bumble but that takes too much time and it’s not what I’m looking for. I just want to grab a cup of coffee with someone (ideally someone local who knows the good places), talk to them for an hour or so, and then move on with my life. Ofc, if we end up becoming friends (or more), I’m very happy but I don’t want that expectation to be there even before meeting the person.\n\nDoes anyone here have any recommendation on apps / websites I should try out? Because I’m seriously considering creating a new app. Maybe even something open-source and/or non-profit. I would like it to be a cool community project where we will create something that like-minded people, people like us, will love and use. Whether for discovering new coffee shops or meeting new people. I would like it to be a place where both coffee lovers and coffee shops will have their own profiles and you can see which coffee shops are trending right now. Maybe even a marketplace for coffee supplies. I guess it would be sort of a social media platform for coffee lovers all around the world. Potential name: Coffeehoppers. What do you think?",

The aroma setting actually seems to control how much ground bean is added to the brew group. By my measurements: lowest aroma = 8s, highest aroma = 10s (actual measurements 8.5s and 10.2s) \n2. I only get well-formed \"pucks\" of spent grinds when using the highest aroma setting (still very wet)\n3. Any aroma setting less than the highest results in a sludge that sticks to the brew group's discharge ramp and must be rinsed away after every use.\n4. I can get a less-wet puck of spent grinds if I use pre-ground beans tamped in the scoop. (Measured to be approx 8g of ground coffee)\n\nI'm using \"medium full body\" beans from a local roaster called Bridgehead, for anyone in Ottawa, it's the Logdriver Espresso roast.\n\nOverall, the espresso that's being delivered seems fine to me (admittedly I'm no expert in this regard), but I'm a bit disappointed with the fact that I'm constantly tending to the brew group.\n\nI am wondering if this is normal for the machine (if not, should I seek a replacement?) or if my choice of bean is to blame? I would expect that regardless of the aroma setting, the spent grounds should be 'dry' enough to slide into the waste bin on their own.",

I had to grind slightly more coarse as at first I was getting some over extracted flavours, but now it's like a whole new world of flavour. I can wholeheartedly reccomend anyone who enjoys a pour over to grab one when they can. It's 100% worth it.",

Knowing myself, I'll end up using the auto brewer during the week so I'd like to still enjoy a decent cup. I understand it wont match the V60. All that being said, I'm looking for an auto brewer that is programable and can still produce a good quality brew. I've looked at the Oxo and Bonivita models but neither of them are able to be programmed that I'm aware of. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",
