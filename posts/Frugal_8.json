Every goddam time I cook legumes from dry they soften up when hot, but when I cool them down they harden up again. If I over cook them they turn to mush, and the ones that don't will still harden up again leaving a weird chalky paste with hard lumps ... I love legumes, and I really want to be able to use dried ones, but I just can't seem to make it work. Unless I only cook what I'm about to eat I can't use dried ones, but I need to batch cook so I can eat at work... I can't find this anywhere online, Google just pops up with beans that never soften. \n\nAnyone else come across this?",

I am willing to pay for a quality fridge that will last, but most new fridges have a built in ice/water dispenser and I do not currently have a water line set up to connect these features. I think I would eventually like to set this up, but don’t think it is a priority right now given that I just need a new fridge as mine is broken so replacing the fridge in the very near future is the most important thing. I also purchased a countertop GE opal nugget ice maker (that I LOVE!) last year, so I already have an ice maker that I use regularly at home. This has been great for drinks, though not great for filling coolers etc. The tap water at my house is great so I just drink straight from the faucet. \n\nI am going back and forth about purchasing a fridge that has the ice/water dispenser given that it would be an extra cost and project to install a water line. My reason for wanting it is that a fridge is an appliance I hope to not need to purchase again any time in the near future and I do not want to regret not having the convenience of these features in the future if I were to want to install the waterline. For example, I am not sure or the life expectancy of my ice maker and if it were to break, would I regret not having the opportunity to just use the ice maker in my fridge? Essentially, it feels like a “nice to have” feature instead of a “need to have feature”, given that I am generally fine with drinking my water from the tap and using my countertop ice maker. I am aware that I could just purchase a new fridge that have these features and then not use them until I am ready, but am wondering if I am missing anything here with the trade off (for example, the space that these features take away from fridge storage if I am not going to use them or if there is a chance that not using the waterline for some time would affect it’s use in the future)? \n\nIt seems like a small cost to have the opportunity to use these features in the future should I wish, but also feels unnecessary all of the same?",

They’d demolish it, and haul it away as trash or scrap. \n\nInstead of this, I advertised the shed online for free to anyone who could use it or the materials. I finally got it removed in whole today by a couple that wants to raise chickens! They are able to use the barn for 90% of their coop, they hauled what they didn’t want away. They are super happy and I am too. \n\nI saved $600+ dollars, they saved on wood and metal, and we are all happy. I’d consider this a win!",

        "text": "Hello, I am 32 M and I am needing help to learn about frugality. Growing up, my parents always tried to find the cheaper/cheapest options for things needed to be done (i.e. auto repair, home improvement, etc.), but their endeavor always ended up costing them more in the short run. So seeing that, I grew up with the view point *the cheaper option, always costs more*.\n\nI've also subconsciously equated frugality with being poor, broke and a *cheap fuck*, to me a cheap fuck is someone whom goes to a restaurant, orders a lot ajd expcts the best service, yet tips $1.00 and thinks that they over tipped. Or someone whom you're sellijg a used product for $10.00 (with a retail value of $20.00) and they barter it down to $7.00 and still complain. I am learning that frugality is not that.\n\nLast year with my recently aquired engineering degree, I went from $41K a year to $70K a year and somehow still found myself broke, a friend told me its due to a term called *Lifestyle Creep*. And the weird part is I don't own anything expensive (i.e. jewelry, car, etc.), but somehow my money goes down the drain. \n\nI also want to know, if it's okay to have areas where you won't compromise on the frugality. Such as keeping the AC temperature below 70 degrees? I reading here how some people really *go all out*. Also, how much should I be saving up? Is frugality a life long journey?\n\nSo if anybody have any books to recommend me, any websites, any hacks, etc. I'd really appreciate it.",

        "text": "I live in the desert in California. Not by either of our choice. Husband’s job.\n\nWith the cold front that’s come in the last few days it’s been about fifty degrees outside but we’ve heard summers usually stay between 82 and 90 degrees. The new apartment we moved into when it’s fifty degrees out feels like eighty. Right now I’m in just socks and a nightgown and pretty uncomfortable. It’s realistically probably not that hot but it’s definitely warm and muggy. I have the two windows in our apartment open and it still feels like absolute hell when we turn the oven on or use the dryer. There’s one ac unit, in the living room, but we tested using it twice a week for 8 hours each time overnight and electricity bill went up almost $50 just for the 8x a month we used it. Any advice to cool the place down? We definitely probably cannot afford another plug in AC as an extra $50 a month on electricity can’t fit into our budget well anyways. It’s 750 sqft and the ac unit, in the living room, takes maybe three hours to actually cool the house down. (We also have a siberian husky who needs to stay cool so we prioritize his health first and give him ice baths which he loves, though.)",
