Since then I've put in a lot of leg-work to fix bugs and improve reliability (running Shellcheck, removing `eval`, fixing problems with almost every part of the software silently swallowing almost every error etc.). This hasn't been easy - not the bug-fixing itself (I've dealt with worse code in my life, shockingly, maybe I'll tell the stories of that one day), but the man who wrote it. Any time I report a bug or change code, he becomes actively hostile, shutting things down as \"not a bug\" or \"you only made this change because you prefer it\" or my personal favourite: \"no-one is using it that way\". This is especially obnoxious because I'm the new guy and he is twice my age, so the higher-ups trust him somewhat more than me. I keep making the changes anyway, because I don't negotiate with terrorists. Yesterday, out of the blue, a customer sent an email to our customer support, saying (paraphrased, but only slightly) \"I don't have a bug to report, but I just wanted to compliment you on how much more reliable the software has become since the last update\".\n\nI celebrated in a way that I believe symbolically represents the occasion: by doing nothing.",

        "text": "EDIT: *Explanation* &amp;mdash; I wrote a \"stopgap\" internal SPA in Angular about two years ago that keeps a bunch of data in IndexedDB so that the app doesn't crash the tab with large workloads.\n\nThe app's roadmap was hijacked before it even launched by an $angryLady who doubled the size of the scope, and then cut our development timeline in half...in the same change request.  We launched on time, building twice as much app in just 3 months rather than the 6 we had planned to spend, but the result bore no resemblance to what I had envisioned.  Every once in a while, she asks me to integrate another feature that makes little-to-no sense, and then questions my dev time estimates with statements like \"Isn't this like three lines of code?  How could you possibly need six hours?\"\n\nThis particular gem resulted from $angryLady ordering me to write her a report that identified users who make innocent mistakes.  You see, IndexedDB doesn't get cleared automatically, only when a specific function is invoked.  The app would see existing data from a previous session in IndexedDB and just pick up where the user left off.  The issue is that users would leave partially-completed work for months, forget about it, and then the partial jobs would get submitted the next time they used the app.  Much finger-pointing ensued when products that had been allocated off the website months ago started spontaneously coming back to life.\n\nI refused to build a Big Brother report on moral grounds, so $angryLady yelled a lot.  Her request was leaked to her staff, who staged a minor coup, and issued a formal request for a feature to opt into starting each app session with an empty IndexedDB.  This way users who actively use the long-term storage capability can continue to do so, but accident prone users can disable it.\n\nWhen I asked how long the opt-in should last (because cookies need to have some sort of expiration), $angryLady said \"lol, forever, duh.\"  I believe I put equal effort into my code as she put into her answer.\n\n-----\n\nFor a nice change of pace, here's some horrible code I just finished writing.\n\n    vm.setPersistance = function (persistance) {\n      $cookies.put('persistancev1', persistance, {expires: Date.parse('2038-01-19')});\n      /* \n       * If this program is still being used in 2038 and nobody finds this bug before then,\n       * please go through HR's records and get in touch with [NAME REDACTED] to let him know.\n       */\n    }\n\nTL;DR: Javascript's Date might not be susceptible to the 2038 bug, but that doesn't mean my code has to be.",

The CEO is pretty tech-savvy and a generally smart dude, but until I joined all the work was done by a single developer. There are a lot of WTF moments in the codebase, but my favourite is one that never actually impacted consumers. We had a point in our code (I will keep using \"we\"/\"our\" here for diplomatic reasons, but I know I'm not fooling anyone) where we were directly `eval`ing user code in shell (most of our codebase is in shell). This would be bad enough, but the only reason we `eval` at all was to glob, which _shell already does_ if you leave a variable unquoted. We only found out about this because we discovered that the part of the software it was included in had a bug that prevented debugging, and that's when I noticed the `eval`. We considered using this to emulate debugging (use shell injection to `wget` and install the package file containing our debug scripts), before realising that this code was totally unreachable because the script that called it had a typo in the filename it used to call into the script. Did I mention that there was no `set -e` anywhere in the code?\n\nOh, and today I found another shell injection issue caused by shelling out from PHP using string concatenation. In a routine added to improve security. Yep.",

        "text": "I made the mistake of opening some of my coworker's code (by clicking on one of the numerous warning messages) and I don't even know what to say. This is the code that controls our entire automated process. I'm gonna skim through the code and write things down as I see them:\n\nAll the code is in a class called Form1 which is ~9000 lines long. I just found ~6000 more lines of the same class in another file. New methods seem to be added randomly between the two files.\n\nI'm not even gonna get into the problems with the user interface.\n\nThe class contains ~200 static class variables and no member variables. One of them is a string called `ch_Tab` with a value of `\"\\t\"` (the string, not the char). It's not a constant.\n\nThere are at least 100 `while` loops that look like this:\n\n    count = 1;\n    while (count &lt; 4) {\n        // ...\n        count += 1;\n    }\n\nThere is one actual `for` loop.\n\nNaming convention seems to be the same for anything with a name. Here's the rule as far as I can tell:\nIf it's a member variable, optionally prefix it with either `\"s_\"` or `\"m_\"`. Randomly write each word in lowercase, Tiltecase, or UPPERCASE and concatenate them. Randomly put underscores between words. I'm not even kidding. Here's some examples:\n\n`first_ProofFolder`, `m_outputType`, `mostOFthem`, `need_aSQL_okmsg`, `deleteIF_exists`, `deliverthe_proofText`.\n\nThere's a ~1000 line method that takes 11 arguments, all of which are `bool`s and most of which are `ref`s. This method is only called once.\n\nI just found a method that's &gt;3500 lines long.\n\nThere are so many empty blocks. Especially after `catch`.\n\nThere's a lot of code that has been commented out. And most of the other comments are just dates of when the method was added. We do use version control by the way.\n\nReturn values typically end with `+ \"\";` for strings and `+ 0;` for ints. Void functions usually end with explicit `return`s.\n\nThis is how to use String.IndexOf according to this code:\n\n    // Equal to haystack.Length if not in original string.\n    (haystack + \"needle\").IndexOf(\"needle\");\n\nHere's some fun functions:\n\nThis first one reinvents the wheel by using the wheel.\n\n    private static string replaceALL(string sourceString, string findString, string replString)\n    {\n        string newString = sourceString + \"\";\n        while (newString.IndexOf(findString) &gt;= 0)\n        {\n            newString = newString.Replace(findString, replString);\n        }\n        return newString + \"\";\n    }\n\n\nThis next one is just a good summary of the general code quality. While also reinventing the wheel.\n\n    private int greater_OF(int parm1, int parm2)\n    {\n        if (parm1 &gt; parm2)\n        {\n            return parm1 + 0;\n        }\n        return parm2 + 0;\n    }\n\nThis one reinvents the wheel, but makes it worse.\n\n    private string padTO(string value, int len) //works up to length of 80\n    {\n        return (value + spaces40 + spaces40).Substring(0, len);\n    }\n\nAnother showcase of how to write code if you don't understand the basics of the language.\n\n    private int tabCount(string theSource)\n    {\n        int ret = 0, y = 1;\n\n        while (y &lt;= theSource.Length)\n        {\n            if (theSource.Substring(y - 1, 1) == ch_Tab)\n            {\n                ret += 1;\n            }\n\n            y += 1;\n        }\n\n        return ret + 0;\n    }\n",

        "text": "I work with embedded systems. Today, I ran across an interesting series of bugs that (almost) nicely canceled themselves out.\n\nThere's a driver that has a number of callbacks. It manages them using a fixed array - when an event happens it iterates over the entire array calling any non-null callbacks. To remove a callback, iterate over the array and set the matching entry to null (or assert if it isn't found). To add a callback, it iterates over the array, attempting to find a free slot. If it finds one, it inserts it there. Otherwise, it asserts. (This is important.) Very simple, and fast enough for our needs (it's only 12 entries), while allowing callbacks to be added and removed essentially at will.\n\nDrivers are classes that get pulled into a central registry and interacted with entirely through said registry - the registry has a pointer-to-something-implementing-said-interface for every interface, and everything is done indirectly through said pointer. (There actually are sane reasons for this for us - I personally don't think the tradeoffs are worth it, but nevertheless there are justifications.) Due to the performance and space implications of inserting a check before every time any driver call happens, the code just unconditionally uses said pointer normally. There is a debug feature for inserting said check, but generally speaking no-one bothers to test with it enabled.\n\nWe use the same interface setup for all the drivers, including cases where we only have one implementation. And we use an optimizing compiler, that's smart enough to directly call the driver if there's only one implementation. Did I mention that the driver in question is one of those drivers?\n\nOh, and some drivers are initialized and registered before others, due to some interesting bootstrapping reasons.\n\nA long time ago, someone decided to add a callback early in boot. Before the driver in question was actually initialized and registered.\n\nAs a result, the reference it uses is to null. Due to the optimizing compiler, it directly calls the driver function, instead of trying to treat *NULL as a pointer-to-function. Only, the driver function ends up being called with an implicit class instance (pointer-to-this, if you'd like) of... Null. 0. Only... 0 is actually a valid address for us. It's the start of ROM. So it treats the start of ROM as the callback array, and starts iterating over it trying to find a free slot. If it ever found a free slot, it would attempt to write there, and fail (due to ROM being read-only), which we would catch. However, given it's the start of ROM, i.e. code, as it happens it fails to find a free slot.\n\n\"But wait\", you say. \"Then it should assert\".\n\nYou're right. It should. Only, someone hadn't *quite* figured out asserts when they wrote the code:\n\n    void addCallback(callback_t *callback) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; NUM_CALLBACKS; i++) {\n            if (mCallbacks[i])\n                continue;\n            mCallbacks[i] = callback;\n            return;\n        }\n        assert(true); // No free callback!\n    }\n\nSome days...",

        "text": "Few years back, I was assigned the maintenance and support of the existing website for one of our clients. Website was built with an open source PHP CMS, used Mysql and was deployed in a unix server at client's premises. It was huge and involved a lot of non-standard functionality, so a lot of custom code and CMS extensions were involved. \n\nOne day I was asked to fix a bug in a specific page that displayed some statistical data. I was initially puzzled to find out that data in this page were not stored within CMS's database, it was rather fetched by an Oracle db, located in a Windows server, also within client's premises. A bit weird, but OK, there must have been reasons. Data in that page involved a publishing workflow. The CMSs admin(s) would be able to create new datasets in draft mode (hidden from public), and publish them at a later time. This is when I found out that there was a second Oracle db involved in the same Windows server. The first one was named something like *'statistics-admin'*, while the latter was named *'statistics-public'*. Do you see where this is going? Well, the two dbs were identical schema-wise, but the first contained all data (public and draft), while the second one contained only the public data (yes, duplicate content). And the UI would switch between the two dbs depending on the logged (or non-logged in) user. I nearly had a stroke. \n\nWell, the \"beauty\" and the reason for this post, is the \"magic\" that happened when the admin wanted to publish the data. Are you with me? At first a *PHP* function was responsible to handle the publish action. Then via PHP, a *shell script* located in the prod server would be invoked. The shell script would then connect via *ssh* to the Windows server and via *cmd* would create a *.bat* file in that server. Then it would fill the bat file with commands to export/dump the *statistics-admin* db and import it to the *statistics-public* db. Finally after the shell script completed, a new ssh connection to the win server would be made (this time directly via PHP) in order to execute the newly created bat file and complete the synchronization process.\n\nHere are some screenshots of the PHP function and shell script contents with all names changed to protect the innocent: http://imgur.com/a/oAdRL\n\nTill this day, it remains the sickest implementation/decision I have ever seen.

Would like to know if anyone good at computer programming/coding can help me with a few aspects for building my new mobile app. Got some of it done already. \n\nHere's a little bit more on what kind of app and its functions:\n\nIt's an app on your phone for people who are looking to carpool from one place to another (driving distance). Using Google Maps, your real-time GPS location is presented with your picture on the map and allows you to see who around you is also on the app and also looking for a carpool. The point of the app is to be able to locate another passenger or driver going from the same place you are, to the same destination you are headed to. You're able to locate one another when you allow GPS to track you and show on the Google Map the app provides. The purpose for this is to be able to get connected to someone with a car that can drive you to where you needed to go in return for credit/debit payment, exchange for gas/toll money. \n\nThe hard part:\n\nThe app is also available as a website on the internet. When you log in to your account, the real-time GPS provided by Google Maps on the website version of the app uses either your last location based on where you were when you last logged in on your mobile device, or using GPS to locate your phone by giving your accounts registered mobile phone number. I want to also be able to use the app and the website at the same time while logged in on both sources. I also want to work on creating a forum where people on the app are able to instant message each other on the app/website to exchange information, details, etc. \n\n\nAnyone who has any experience in this sort of thing or anyone that thinks they could be of help, message me or comment below!

        "text": "So, this happened a couple of years ago when I was still in school. We had an online grading system. Basically the school had a website and each student had his own account.\n\nOne night out of pure boredom and curiosity (I swear) I tried to get in the system's database.\n\nI started with the obvious. Is there an exploit on the admin login page? Spoiler: there was.\n\nThe website utilized one of the worst login system I have ever seen. The authentication happened client side, and the the result was sent to the server through AJAX. I was shocked first, then I realized I shouldn't have expected anything better.\n\nSo I got into the admin account, but I couldn't do much. I could post news articles and change some aspects of the website. This was lame, so I went further.\n\nI tried finding a phpMyAdmin login site, but I couldn't, so at last, I went a bit deeper, and I targeted the database itself\n\nI used PHP for convenience (pretty ironic, I know).\n\nThe database was on the port 3306, as usual, but I was missing something. The password and the username. I sat there for about half an hour thinking about how I could get into there, and just for the sake I tried entering \"root\" as a username and nothing as a password...\n\n...I got in. I sat there with an expressionless face for about 5 minutes. I dumped the contents of the database. There were 3 separate tables, 2 of which are important for this post, and one about the page information. One of them was named \"users\", the other was \"teachers\". You can probably guess which one's which.\n\nI dumped the contents of both tables, and I saw 3 columns, \"name\", \"password\" and \"isAdmin\". Here came the next shock, the passwords where stored in plain text, including my own. I tried it on the main site, and boom, I saw a random guy's grades.\n\nThe teacher table was the same. I also confirmed this one. I didn't change any grades though.\n\nNext day when I saw the IT teacher, who was responsible for the website too, I told him \"Maybe you shouldn't leave database passwords on default values\". He first was very confused, then his expression slowly turned to a mix of shocked and anxious. I silently left, as if nothing has happened.\n\nThe password was changed next day.",

        "text": "So my company doesn't want us using secure emails to send files to clients anymore so they rolled out a feature to send files via secure ad-hoc ftp accounts. The client receives a generated username and password which they can use to access the account and download/upload files.\n\n\nWell, lately we've been getting clients saying that sometimes when they try to download a file, they'll get an \"invalid credentials\" messages. The weird thing is, if their account has, say, 6 files, they can download 4 with no problem but get the message with the other two.\n\n\nI just got off the phone with IT and the conversation went something like this:\n\n\nMe: So, any idea why this is happening?\n\n\nIT: Yeah, we've come across this from other users. If a client copies and pastes their password, it will sometimes have an extra space at the end. They can log in with it but it causes issues with some files.\n\n\nMe: . . . So what do I tell them?\n\n\nIT: Just tell them not to copy and paste it. They have to type it in manually.\n\n\nI'm not a professional programmer, but that just sounds like a horrible coding job. Why would a password with an extra space even work? And why not code it to just trim off extra spaces at the end instead of using having to spend time walking clients through on how to enter their password? How lazy can you be?",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/5unm90/the_story_of_a_lonely_method/)\n\nSo we left off with the following two static methods:\n\n    public static float manhattan(Point A, Point B) {\n        return Math.abs(A.x - B.x) + (float) Math.abs(A.y - B.y);\n    }\n\n    public static float distance(Point A, Point B) {\n        float distX = A.x - B.x;\n        float distY = A.y - B.y;\n        return (float) Math.sqrt(distX * distX + distY * distY);\n    }\n\nNow, to continue the story, let me introduce you to Rob. I think Rob has OCD. He always extends everything he thinks isn't completed. He looked at the commits, and he found this two methods, and he thought there's something missing, but what... Oh right, the [Canberra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_distance) distance! So he made a new method:\n\n    public static float canberra(Point A, Point B) {\n        float x = Math.abs(A.x - B.x) / (Math.abs(A.x) + Math.abs(A.y));\n        float y = Math.abs(A.y - B.y) / Math.abs(A.y) + Math.abs(A.x));\n        return x + y;\n    }\n\n(This happened 6 months ago, and no one has used this method ever, nor does anyone know where this should be used.)\n\nOk, this isn't that bad (apart from wasting time). But then Bob came along. Bob still thinks, that one method is better than multiple, so he took every function, and put them into one (I shortened the code, because it would be way too long):\n\n    public static float distance(int type) {\n        if (type == 0) {\n            // Euclidean distance code\n        } else if (type == 1) {\n            // Manhattan distance code\n        } else if (type == 2) {\n            // Canberra distance code\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nMy first reaction was complete confusion. Just the fact that you had to know what you need to pass in for it to work, and if you fail in it, then it dies silently scared me. I asked him to refactor it, so it uses enums, and no magic values, and switches instead of a chain of ifs.\n\nHe did...kind of. The result was this:\n\n    public static int EUCLIDEAN = 0;\n    public static int MANHATTAN = 1;\n    public static int CANBERRA = 2;\n\n    public static float getDistance(Point A, Point B, int type) {\n        if (type == 0) {\n            // Euclidean distance\n        } else if (type == 1) {\n            // Manhattan distance\n        } else if (type == 2) {\n            // Canberra distance\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nWell, almost. He completed the half of one of my requirements.\n\nA bit of background info for non-java developers. We use java 8, and since java 5 you could make enumerations, static values with names:\n\n    enum Type {\n        TYPE1,\n        TYPE2,\n        TYPE3 \n    }\n\n    Type.TYPE1\n\nThey are amazing if you want to achieve user friendliness.\n\nI told him he should use them (he already knew about them). Finally, he achieved something that's acceptable:\n\n    public static float distance(Point A, Point B, Type type) {\n        switch (type) {\n            case Type.EUCLIDEAN:\n                // Euclidean distance code\n                break;\n            case Type.MANHATTAN:\n                // Manhattan distance code\n                break;\n            case Type.CANBERRA:\n                // Canberra distance code\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n(It's a shame this took almost 3 days)\n\nI made a second method though, which didn't take in a type parameter and defaulted to euclidean distance, because we use that the most.\n\nThen Jim came along, and he took everything apart, because why not. But don't worry, it wasn't a sane refactoring. He still took in the type parameter, he just didn't use it, and he left the default method there.\n\nI ended up fixing everything and I removed them from the file's editor list.\n\nI'm still tempted to put some zero width spaces in their code though.",

        "text": "Let me tell you about the story of a method in a java project I've been working on.\n\nLong ago I had to get the distance between two Point objects, and because there wasn't any set way to do it, I made a static method in the Point class:\n\n    public static float getDistance(Point A, Point B) {\n        // Distance between the 2 points\n        return (float) Math.sqrt(Math.pow(A.x - B.x, 2) + Math.pow(A.y - B.y, 2));\n    }\n\nAnd this method stood here unchanged for almost 2 days (believe me, that's impressive).\n\nThen another programmer came along, let's call him Jim. He looked through the commits to the project, and when he found this part, he thought it's not very clear, so he changed it:\n\n    public static float getDistance(Point A, Point B) {\n        // Distance on the x and y axis\n        float distX = A.x - B.x;\n        float distY = A.y - B.y;\n        // Total distance with Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)\n        float dist = (float) Math.abs(Math.sqrt(Math.pow(distX, 2) + Math.pow(distY, 2)));\n        return dist;\n    } \n\nThis edit may look a bit stupid to you. Don't worry, it is (it reflects Jim's intelligence pretty well). Because that abs has literally no purpose there, I removed it and later spoke to Jim about this. He understood and never touched the code again.\n\nThen someone else came along, let's call him Bob. Bob is lazy, he doesn't like creating new stuff. He also had a problem similar to mine, but he had to get the Manhattan distance between two vectors (vectors and points share the same \"Position\" super class).\n\nInstead of doing it the proper way by creating a new method in the vector class, he took the current method, moved it to the Position class and changed it a \"bit\":\n\n    public float getDistance(Position A, Position B, boolean isVector) {\n        if (isVector) {\n            return Math.abs(A.x - B.x) + Math.abs(A.y - B.y);\n        } else {\n            float distX = A.x - B.x;\n            float distY = A.y - B.y;\n            return (float) Math.sqrt(distX * distX + distY * distY);\n        }\n    }\n\nYep, using a boolean flag. Because reusability is overrated...\n\nSince this, I had to take this Frankenstein of a method apart into a Manhattan distance method and an Euclidean distance method, because Bob himself started passing it a true when dealing with points and vica-versa to get the appropariate distance method.\n\nThis is only half of the story though, this isn't how the method got finalized, but I post that later.",

Those of you who have been at this game for a while probably know where this is about to go.\n\nConfused as to how 159 dictates a success, as does 157 and 155 (and really most numbers &gt; 128) I decided to dig.\n\nThat's when I discovered it was a bitmask. But it gets better. Nowhere is this mask actually documented. In fact, the only reason I know how it works is because I found the code that generates icons for whether or not things worked.\n\nHere is said code\n\n    image = 'help16.png';\n    if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 128) {\n    image = 'tick16.png';\n    } else if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 64) {\n    image = 'left16.png';\n    } else if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 32) {\n    image = 'delete16.png';\n    } else if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 16) {\n    image = 'down16.png';\n    } else if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 8) {\n    image = 'up16.png';\n    } else if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 4) {\n    image = 'right16.png';\n    } else if (data.pmts[i].state &amp; 2) {\n    image = 'warning16.png';\n    }\n\nI am now waiting on a user to explain what the various arrows mean so I can write a human readable status.\n\nThis might make sense if this was a 30 year old COBOL engine, but it isn't. It's a 10 year old JavaScript/PHP website. \n\nHurray!\n\n*EDIT: Double and triple checked, he never actually checks anything outside of the leading bit. There's no \"Success with warning\" scenario.
