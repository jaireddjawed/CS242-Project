So here we go.\n\nStarts off with the typical rhetoric \"oh I think the nazis are dumb too\", goes on to show its true colors with its responses to the comments.\n\nSome of the funniest highlights includes\n\n(In response to I have the right to punch nazis if nazis think they should kill people)\n\n&gt;And here is the problem here folks. Here is the problem right here...Do you not see a problem with this ? How in the hell do you not see hypocrisy here ? You think violence is ok to someone who is just saying their bullshit views ? You actually don't have the right to assault someone unless you are in a self defense situation.A lot of Nazi's and White Nationalists are gun owners. Surely you don't think it is a good idea. Responding with violence is stooping to their level. You are like the Charlie Hebdo cartoonist terrorists who killed cartoonists over a cartoon of the prophet Muhammed. How are you different than them ? Because I don't see it. Violence is never the answer unless it is for self-defense. It doesn't matter what someone believes in.Once again, if there is a law passed permitting people to respond with violence to hate speech, then your ass can be kicked one day for saying an opinion that someone doesn't like. It is a slippery slope dude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This is my unpopular opinion, but if I'm a business owner (I hope to be one one day) then I would service anyone. Nazi, Jew, KKK member, gay, straight, ect. Money is fucking money. A smart business man sells to everyone and leaves politics out of it. More tolerance = more money.But you surely don't think it is worth losing money over for denying people services based on their political views, do you ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Who gives a fuck. You have a business to make money, taking a (perceived) moral high ground has no reward. Denying a Nazi or a Republican service does not reap any rewards. Actually it hurts your business in the long run. Why ? Because there would be outrage on social media and now half of your customers could be lost because you want to get all political about it.I am thinking from a business perspective. I'm in it to make money. If you are in it for the politics then you are playing the wrong game.",

People complain about immigrants being lazy, but i bet most immigrants at least are better behaved than white expats, who are almost certainly assholes.\n\nIronically the only good english teacher I have ever met is a black dude from California  who taught me about rhetoric and gives example on how the moderates try to whitewash figures such as Nelson Mandela and MLK to make them more appealing to white liberals. He also played the class a documentary about Thomas Sankara, which is good praxis.\n\nEDIT: Oh and I forgot to mention that white expat guy was literally a former wall street worker, so hes probably bad to begin with.",
