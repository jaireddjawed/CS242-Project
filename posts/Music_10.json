        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nthere's this video that i cannot find on youtube anymore, mainly because the name was in Japanese and i feel like i'm going crazy. It was a video made with cgi, it was a chillout/funky song with a female voice with the camera flying around as the singer was melting into a pink blob. Very trippy vibe, the landscape was like a barren grey-ish land. The singer, she also did some rapping in the song. I remember seraching for her at the time and she was tagged as a rapper too. I remember that the video got plenty of hits, probably millions, cause it was very cool and artistic. At one point in the song she said \"kudasai\". And last thing i remember, when i serached for a translation of the songs it said it was a song about \"tea\".  \nPlease if you have any idea, help me find this amazing song/video!   \nThank you all.",
