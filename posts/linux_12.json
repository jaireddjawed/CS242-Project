Back in the day, there was a lot of excitement and innovation in the space, and it felt like the world of opensource was led by Linux projects big and small. Many developers preferred working in a Linux environment. \n\nToday, opensource is everywhere, whether being used in Linux, windows, mac, mobile, or web. It is possible to install Windows subsystem for Linux and run command line programs and even GUI programs on Windows. Microsoft's Visual Studio Code has become the standard IDE across platforms and Github the standard codebase. CLI is still pretty important for developers, but it seems like you can use any OS you want with relative ease.\n\nI am thinking of reinstalling linux to make web development with CLI tools liks npm, git, etc easier, but I will have to dualboot for gaming + graphic design. I don't need headaches, I just need things to work as well as they can. I don't want to spend weeks on this. I may just try windows subsystem for Linux, but I do miss running Fedora, etc sometimes.\n\nSo i'm curious, where is linux doing well these days and being used, and where has it been doing less well?",

Working and coming from the Windows side for me I think being able to do things in Linux that I can do in windows including the more advanced things when it comes to troubleshooting is my litmus test but I wanted to get some other experience. I don't know many people irl that use Linux at all (and even for me it's not a daily driver on ALL my machines) so my sample size for questions like these is...well non-existent. But then I remembered the Linux sub reddit. (Adderall shortage is pain)\n\nCurrently I am running the latest Ubuntu LTS and while I feel I am good with it I don't think I would consider myself as having learned it. Troubleshooting and understanding the various issues or weirdness I run into still give me enough issue from time to time, means that Google is still my friend (not that I expect to ever not have to Google something). \n\nSo for some insight I ask the question once more: what, to you, makes you feel you have learned a Linux distro to a satisfying amount? \n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hi, \n\nI posted recently about a new command line Kafka client I've been developing for personal and commercial use; I now have some updates to share\n\nThanks to requests and suggestions on here, other subs and actual commercial usage, `klient` now has a completely revamped CLI and the following features:\n\n* Simple and intuitive CLI (command line interface)\n* Describe clusters by outputing information about brokers, topics and partitions\n* Create topics with default values or with specific partition counts and replication factors\n* Delete topics  \n* Read topics quickly and simply as an exclusive consumer (all messages in all partitions)  \n* Read from topics with granular control over the partition and the offset or time ranges  \n* Read from topics as part of a shared consumer group  \n* Format data read from topics so it can be readily piped into other processes, such parsers (eg: pipe `json` values into `jq` for formatting and querying purposes)\n* Write to topics interactively by following simple CLI prompts to specify the value and, an optional, key\n* Write to topics based on data read from `stdin`, such as data piped from a pre-defined file of topic values; optionally containing their associated keys\n* Authenticate anonymously or with TLS and/or SASL (using plain or SCRAM credentials) \n* Ships as a single binary for ease of deployment and installation; even on scratch based container images (does not require `libc`)\n* Confidently backed by a solid suite of unit and integration tests\n\nAs a recap, or for those who  missed the original post, unlike the standard scripts, and many binary clients, `klient` is a native, statically-compiled, binary. It uses [segmentio/go-kafka](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) internally, which means `CGO` can be disabled during compilation.\n\nThis makes it very portable, especially when using `scratch`-based container images.\n\nYou can get full details in the [README](https://github.com/comradequinn/klient#readme) and you can download pre-built binaries for your preferred system [here](https://github.com/comradequinn/klient#installation) or browse the releases [here](https://github.com/comradequinn/klient/releases)\n\nAppreciate there's some other options out there, but I hope some of you find it useful :-)",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nSo I have a half-decent Hi-Fi setup and recently added a new USB to SPDIF dongle that does 24/96. (The DAC in my AV receiver/amplifier can't handle 44100 Hz correctly and can't hahdle 192k at all, so 24/96 is the best choice I have). I run Fedora, currently on 36.\n\nSpotify, with its Linux desktop client running as a Flatpak, sounds rather good, but I'd rather try something lossless. But what provider can I use?\n\nI tried TIDAL. But the web player, with the Hi Fi setting, sounds somewhat worse than Spotify; I guess that Google Chrome might not be doing bit-perfect audio from that lossless stream. The only Linux desktop client for Tidal I found was Strawberry, and I have not as yet managed to get it to connect to TIDAL, though I need to play around with getting files from the mobile phone.\n\nI tried Apple Music. Their Web client can't do lossless. Nor can Cider. Nor can the Snap version of Apple music desktop (which seems to be a wrapper around the Web client).\n\nI can't find even a hint of a Linux client for Qobuz or Amazon Music Unlimited.\n\nSo, what ways might there be to get proper lossless streaming on Linux? Or am I limited to Spotify 320k OGG, plus finding FLAC versions of stuff I really want to hear in best quality?",

Despite this, and the valiant efforts of  'it just works' distros like Linux Mint, ZorinOS, Ubuntu, Elementary OS,  Pop!\\_OS, etc., Linux still struggles in desktop martketshare. The  writer believes that onbaording can help remedy this issue. Much like  installing a new app on your phone gives you a quick overview of what  the app does and how to use it, onbaording can be done in Linux distros  to get users familiar with how the desktop works. This includes updating  the system, downloading and installing software, changing system  settings, pointing out and explaining useful tools, and so on. In the  author's mind, this is done through a step-by-step wizard that points  to, or circles, where the user needs to click and what they need to do.\n\nI  know that DE's like KDE Plasma with the 5.27 release have created their  own welcome screen, and of course most 'it just works' distros nowadays  have their own welcome screens as well. However, this takes it a big  step further. Thoughts?",

You need to trudge [through the documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/spins/) or know about the existence of the [spins.fedoraproject.org](https://spins.fedoraproject.org) site.\n\nThis also doesn't include distros that had a KDE edition and later axed it - most famous of all, [Mint](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Mint-Dropping-KDE). It's rather obvious why they did that - to push their in house DE, Cinnamon. But it still reaffirms how many popular distros which have a \"KDE\" edition, and either don't show make it accessible to know about. Most of these distros even ship with GNOME or a GTK+ based DE.\n\nWhy do these distros treat KDE as a second class citizen??",

        "text": "They both have on board RGB, meaning you can get that gamer aesthetic without having to even install software on your computer. This means, of course, that they will work fine on Linux, or even on a console. Even without RGB, it's still a fantastic case because of all the air flow from its mesh panel front that also serves as a dust filter. They're also relatively affordable for your first build, the case is like $90 and the keyboard is like $50. As much of a meme as RGB is in the gaming community, it's honestly really nice and adds a fantastic customizable bit of visual flair, and being able to use it without having to worry about whether or not the software will work on Linux is fantastic. Just a heads up for any noobs: You might need to look up a guide for daisy chaining the fans together. I had to and would have been completely lost without it.",

        "text": "Hello, I used belenaEtcher to flash an SSD as described in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/_Ua-d9OeUOg?t=170). I used an adapter which treats my ssd like a USB drive. Simple enough.\n\nBut now that I have PopOS installed on my computer, it doesn't recognize the SSD as a storage device! I can't save files to it or delete anything. (I have if connected via SATA, as it should be.) I know that it is correctly plugged in and everything because I can see it on my BIOS. Linux just pretends it... isn't there.\n\nThis is especially a pain because I am trying to install Windows for a dual boot. Windows won't install on my NVME drive (weird), so that leaves the SSD, but it doesn't want to install on the SSD either! Did I screw up a perfectly good drive? How do I clear it and get it back to normal?\n\nThanks.",
