Instead, they would prefer to live in gated and guarded residential areas, spend time in areas where not everyone is allowed and commute using a private vehicle. \n\nPerhaps, this is a major source of motivation for the proponents of a suburban, car-centric lifestyle. What are your thoughts on the very visible social ills in public spaces of major cities?",

Last year before the winter break I decided to take a break from my studies at university to do a community college GIs &amp; Planning technician program to see if I would like urban planning as a job. The classes at the college taught me how to design diagrams of subdivisions &amp; streets using software like Sketchup, Autocad, and Adobe photoshop but very little on urban planning from an policy perspective. We didn't learn anything about public transit systems, economic development, how neighbourhoods develop, or land use planning. This was a total shock to me because I thought that urban planning was almost entirely policy based focused on urban development and land use planning. I loathed the community college planning technician program &amp; quit out of disappointment.\n\nIf I were to do a masters or PhD in Urban Planning after my Geography undergrad would it similarly focus on teaching how to use design software to create diagrams of streets &amp; subdivisions? Do Urban Planners just sit around designing diagrams of streets &amp; subdivisions all day or is the technical drawing aspect of planning handled by planning technicians?\n\nWhat's the difference between an urban planner with a masters/phd degree and a planning technician in terms of job description?",

IMO we need to put more power into the hands of professionals and find ways to bypass local councils, commissions, and boards who are more often than not composed of home-owning retirees doing this in their free time and voting with their feelings rather than professionals making evidence-based decisions.",

        "text": "I am curious about CDDs and I have a few questions about them. Are there comparable frameworks in other US states or around the world and what role do professional planners, if any, have in this form of local government that is an alternative to the municipal corporation? These are master-planned communities, but does that mean that they necessarily have comprehensive plans like most municipalities in the US?  It seems like some of them indeed have urban planning departments but I am not sure if that is universal. A sort of tangentially related question is: do many people who study or work in urban planning move to the private sector but still find their skills applicable or apply them as entrepreneurs?\n\nBelow is the background for my question.\n\n[This article from Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/01/the-villages-is-a-boomers-utopia-and-demographic-time-bomb), an excerpt from an upcoming book about demography and politics, has a sensational title, but overall it is a mostly fair assessment of a place, in my opinion; I found it educational but not entirely reflective of its title. I think The Villages is a fascinating place, but I can understand how residents and others might find the coverage, given past coverage based an unfounded rumors, truly sensational and needlessly intrusive. Discussing Florida can also be a polarizing topic these days but there is no question that it is a significant and growing place, so I hope that any discussion or opinions shared that might follow is civil and informative, especially if it happens to go beyond the questions I asked. \n\nThe article notes that it is an intentional community that is well-loved by its residents and truly is tight-knit (“People come not for the homes but the amenities— and for the community within and between the developments”). Its coverage of the Villages fits in with another recent piece of coverage about the place in popular mass media, taking an angle that on economic and urban development. In a video about Florida’s development history by Wendover Productions (also with a sensational and click-baity title, “[How Florida Got So Weird](https://youtu.be/AIqxfBhlwx0,include)” that doesn't fully reflect its content ) it has a starring role (alongside Cape Coral and (West) Palm Beach, both of which are not CDDs). \n\nSome of the most surprising things I learned about the Villages from the VF article are that its population could increase to 250,000 in the near future with expansion and that it may begin constructing more housing for younger people. So descriptively I would call it a city or at least a very large suburb. But maybe the Villages defy easy descriptive explanation. The VF article defines the place as “a series of interconnected housing developments—the “villages” themselves—marketed as an all‑inclusive lifestyle that redirected retirement from senior community centers to senior‑ centered communities”, and notes that it is one of the fastest growing places in the country.\n\nI have been aware that Florida has a lot of special purpose districts, perhaps the most famous been the one at Disney World, but something lacking from these recent pieces of coverage about the Villages, but buried a little deep in its Wikipedia article (it is primarily defined there as a CDP) is the specific vehicle under which it is formed and governed, which was my TIL-about-this moment: the [Community Development District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development_district).",

Firstly, because outside a self-selecting sample of major economic centers and tourist hubs, I'm not sure if all European cities would pass the smell-test this sub has for best practices.\n2. I think we also risk conflating genuine progressive change with just imitating whatever Europe does, ignoring local contexts that could challenge the applicability of those lessons.\n3. On a more personal note, I think it just sounds snobby when people talk about good urban policy by sharing anecdotes from their Euro-trip, and then say something like \"But none of that exists in America!\".\n4.  I worry this attitude is also counter-productive to achieving change in America and other countries, because it risks framing every urban policy debate as \"catching up to 'Europe'\", which residents might resent.\n\nEven though there's plenty to learn from European urban planning, cities in North America and elsewhere are perfectly capable of becoming great places to live on their own terms, and denigrating that potential would be a serious error.\n\nI'm not interested in making this a debate post or CMV.

(See [White Plains Code of Ordinances Sec. 9-7-3](https://library.municode.com/ny/white_plains/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIXZOPLBUST_CH9-7AFHORE_ARTIAFREHORE_S9-7-3AFHORE).)  Developments between 10 and 14 units have to reserve 1 unit as affordable; developments above 14 units have to have either 12% or 8% affordable units, depending on which income group is served.  But because  this developer intends to develop all 98 McMansions for  sale, not rental, White Plains' Planning Commissioner says it's exempt  from this requirement and doesn't have to include *any* affordable units.  (See [Planning Board Jan. 9, 2023 meeting video](http://whiteplainsny.swagit.com/play/01102023-803) at 3:04.)\n\nIn the first place, is the Planning Commissioner's interpretation of the Ordinance correct?  The Ordinance applies to \"Any multi-family rental or mixed-use development that includes ten (10) or more residential rental units including new construction.\" ([Code of Ordinances Sec. 9-7-2(J).](https://library.municode.com/ny/white_plains/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIXZOPLBUST_CH9-7AFHORE_ARTIAFREHORE_S9-7-2DE))  This Developer plans to build 98 McMansions and sell them off.  But in America today, a significant number of single family homes ultimately end up as rental housing, due to the increased prevalence of investor-owned housing.  So, it is conceivable that, ultimately, 10 or more of the houses might function as rentals rather than owner-occupied.  Does the Planning Commissioner have to at least look into this to determine if the project meets the definition in Code of Ordinances Sec. 9-7-2(J)?\n\nSecond, assuming the Planning Commissioner is right and that the Ordinance does not apply, what's the inherent justice in the fact that the McMansion developer doesn't have to include affordable units?  Is  this like a loophole / oversight / arbitrary difference?  Or is there a  good reason why a downtown \"luxury rental\" development should be  subject to an affordable housing requirement but a development of almost  a hundred McMansions in an outer neighborhood should not?",

I think planners could create such an environment if they're willing to create a subsidy for higher occupancies\n\nbut to shape the rollout of SDCs like above, planning is needed. however, it seems that most urban planning folks I talk to seem to either think SDCs are never going to exist, in spite of them operating today for the general public, or that cars=bad and thus don't want to plan for them, even if the negative aspects of cars can be dramatically reduced by getting 2-3 fares per vehicle and having them be electric. \n\nso this all leads me to wonder, should planning for SDCs ever happen? if so, when? if it does, what kinds of shaping of the industry should happen? I've laid out 1 possible scenario of how a city could be changed for the better by them, but what do you guys think? are there other things that could be even better?",

You can simply design retail areas different than what they are today. Older main streets and commercial areas have stores that are built closer to the street and have wide sidewalks. Not building strip developments would be a better way to promote pedestrian friendliness. Places like Old Towne Orange are built with this type of design. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old\\_Towne,\\_Orange\\_Historic\\_District#/media/File:Fountain\\_at\\_the\\_Orange\\_Circle.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Towne,_Orange_Historic_District#/media/File:Fountain_at_the_Orange_Circle.jpg) San Elijo Hills incorporates classic pedestrian friendly design as well , but has on street parking and parking in the back [https://www.ambientcommunities.com/portfolio/san-elijo-town-center-marketwalk/](https://www.ambientcommunities.com/portfolio/san-elijo-town-center-marketwalk/)\n2. Eliminating on street parking and removing vehicle traffic makes deliveries and trash pickup more difficult and more costly.\n3. On street parking not only makes deliveries easier, makes your business more accessible which is good for business. It also reduces the need for parking lots and parking structures. \n4. Cars are a thing - the elimination of cars has never been done and likely never will be. Hong Kong, which to my knowledge has the lowest car ownership of developed countries, still has motor vehicles. Eliminating cars entirely or eliminating cars except for certain edge case scenarios is not a practical goal. Reducing driving is a practical goal, eliminating it isn't. You have to accommodate cars to some extent. Making driving too difficult will either make your development unviable or much less viable.\n5. It's largely been unsuccessful - Over 89% of Pedestrian malls have failed and been reconverted back. Not only did pedestrian malls not revitalize main streets or downtowns, they hastened their decline. Only University towns were able to make them \"work\" [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284542059\\_The\\_Experiment\\_of\\_American\\_Pedestrian\\_Malls\\_Trends\\_Analysis\\_Necessary\\_Indicators\\_for\\_Success\\_and\\_Recommendations\\_for\\_Fresno's\\_Fulton\\_Mall](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284542059_The_Experiment_of_American_Pedestrian_Malls_Trends_Analysis_Necessary_Indicators_for_Success_and_Recommendations_for_Fresno's_Fulton_Mall)   \n\"Burlington, Iowa's Jefferson Street's ground-floor vacancies dropped from 80% to 20% once the two blocks were reopened to cars\" The article provides numerous other examples of positive economic development trends from opening up areas to vehicles.  \nAllowing car traffic to return to Buffalo's main street has actually helped revive it [https://www.planetizen.com/node/86726/cars-credited-comeback-main-street](https://www.planetizen.com/node/86726/cars-credited-comeback-main-street)\n\nPedestrianization would likely just lead to businesses leaving an area and removing its economic vitality.",

        "text": "I live in a college town that is increasingly interested in becoming more pedestrian and bicycle friendly especially in their downtown areas. At the same time a vast majority of the town is rural/suburban and there is definitely the need to address the large majority that goes to/from the downtown area via car.\n\nWithout going cold turkey, what are some traffic management strategies that the town could look into to address some bottlenecks  in town but at the same time not add new turn lanes or be too focused on level of service? Some initial thoughts was working to optimize traffic signals and roundabouts. Any other ideas?",

        "text": "Today, new [annual population estimates](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230111/dq230111c-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&amp;utm_medium=smo&amp;utm_campaign=statcan-population-22-23) for Canada’s subprovincial regions for July 1, 2022, have been released.\n\nCanada’s census metropolitan areas (CMAs) experienced a significant rebound in population growth in 2021/2022, with many seeing their population increase at the fastest annual pace since at least 2001/2002. New permanent immigrants and net gains of non-permanent residents accounted for most of this growth. The estimates released today give us a regional look at the demographic trends emerging in Canada following a year with fewer restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; with increased immigration targets by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada; and with the admission of people fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere are a few highlights:\n\n* The CMAs of Moncton, New Brunswick, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, had the fastest growth rates of all CMAs in 2021/2022, at 5.3% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are more than twice that of Canada (+1.8%) for the same period and represent the first time in at least 20 years that both of the fastest growing CMAs are found in the Atlantic provinces.\n* All CMAs in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario saw net losses from people moving to other provinces in 2021/2022. This contrasts with all CMAs in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec (except Montréal) and Alberta, which recorded net gains from other provinces.\n\n*We are Canada’s national statistical agency.

De nombreuses RMR ont enregistré leur plus forte croissance annuelle depuis au moins 2001-2002. L’arrivée de nouveaux immigrants permanents et les gains nets de résidents non permanents ont été à l’origine de la majeure partie de cette croissance. Les estimations diffusées aujourd’hui, nous donnent un aperçu régional des nouvelles tendances démographiques au Canada après une année ayant été marquée par une réduction des restrictions liées la pandémie de COVID-19, par une augmentation des cibles d’immigration établies par Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada, et par l’accueil de personnes fuyant l’invasion russe de l’Ukraine.\n\nVoici quelques faits saillants :\n\n* Les RMR de Moncton au Nouveau-Brunswick (+5,3 %) et d’Halifax en Nouvelle-Écosse (+4,4 %) ont connu les taux d’accroissement démographique les plus élevés parmi les RMR en 2021-2022. Ces taux de croissance sont plus de deux fois supérieurs à celui du Canada durant la même période (+1,8 %). C’est la première fois depuis au moins 20 ans que les deux RMR qui affichent la plus forte croissance se trouvent dans les provinces de l’Atlantique.\n* Toutes les RMR de la Saskatchewan, du Manitoba et de l’Ontario ont connu des pertes nettes de population vers d’autres provinces. En revanche, toutes les RMR des provinces de l’Atlantique, du Québec (sauf Montréal) et de l’Alberta ont enregistré des gains nets de population en provenance d’autres provinces.\n\n*Nous sommes l’organisme national de statistique du Canada.

Just wondering if this is an indication I did a bad job on this case and failed to properly consider the stance of the planning commissioners. The report was of course reviewed by my supervisor, who agreed 100% with my recommendation. Normally, the commission follows the recommendation of staff in my city, so I'm not sure how I should feel about their decision.",

At multiple city council meetings, a new city council member frequently asks city planners for deceleration lanes to be installed when new buildings are being built on larger residential and minor arterial streets even when traffic volume impacts are not expected to be large.\n\nI've done some web search but 95% is focused on highways, which makes me think outside of a major arterial with heavy turn volume like a major shopping center or school there really are not indications for deceleration lanes on non-highway streets.\n\nAny help appreciated!
