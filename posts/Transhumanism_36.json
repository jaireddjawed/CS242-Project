Does anyone have any personal connections? My promotion budget is almost non-existent (limited to my personal bank account), but I'd love to send out a few paperbacks!\n\nAlso, I've been giving out the ebook for free to the subreddits that helped me in the writing process. If you like new adult fiction and sci-fi, [check it out.](http://www.vanderarkbooks.com/the-day-i-wore-purple-reddit)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n[My work on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5005386.Jake_Vander_Ark) so you know I'm legit.",

        "text": "**Disclaimer**\n\nEverything is subject to change based on democratic opinion of those involved in the initial project to start up the community, including name. Everybody eligible will have equal impact with the assumption that all academic members are rational and therefor able to make intelligent and informed decisions mostly, but preferably entirely, free from bias, manipulation, and misinformation. Any constructive feedback is outmost appreciated.\n\nI've made a post about the subject previously [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/485p4t/any_academic_transhumanism_communities/).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAfter thorough research, several inquiries, and many social dialogues; I've come to the conclusion that there is no community for academics interested in transhumanism, and that there is a considerable demand for it. Following the conclusion, many of us have decided to form one. With my prior professional and avocational experience in both marketing, promotion, and community management; I'll be spearheading the project.\n\nATA - The Academic Transhumanism Assocation is a community exclusive for academic individuals that meet certain criterias to ensure intellectual competence within the community, with the purpose of fostering academic/intellectual dialogue exchanges, further educate on the subject of philosophy involved and its currents, promote research through collaboration, social networking, and voluntarily sharing knowledge and data, among other goals.\n\n**Admission**\n\nMembership is exclusive and will be free. To apply, one must be able to prove academic position and/or background related to transhumanism (examples: BSc, MSc, PhD; BME, BE, ME, CS, EE, PE, Mathematics, Medicine, Law. Comprehensive list will be available on the website). Evaluation of information is reviewed in confidence and never released to the public under any circumstances, and all information will be permanently erased once approved by atleast two individuals with proper administration rights. Login information to the website and forums will be sent by email, alongside contact details to admins. Several countermeasures against social engineering will be used to gaurantee the identity of our members since, as already stated, all information will later be deleted for reasons related to personal privacy. To add: we also accept undergrad students.\n\nIt is possible to skip a lot of the countermeasures through direct referral by a representative.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nA website and forums is currently under construction. The former will serve as a front representation of our community where the frontpage will show curated articles related to research, studies, philosophy, news, politics, among other subjects. Other planned pages on the website would be an archive for all articles, educational pages to introduce Transhumanism and the many philosophical branches involved, members' list (members decide what to show and what to hide (public or within the community) with the option of being completely anonymous), educational pages for academic purposes (more on this will be explained later), and other features and information.\n\nSeveral volunteer individuals will receive various exclusive rights to to create and edit specific pages, with positions such as news curator within certain fields, writers, organizers, et cetera. Everything will be run by the community, with transparency and democracy.\n\nThe forums will serve as our main social hub where most social interaction and dialogue exchanges occur. It will be moderated by several individuals with rights to specific subforums, and a few global adminstrators with rights to every subforum. Many practical features will be present. A comprehensive list will be announced later.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nPromotion will be conducted through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, et cetera) but also through referral and by on-location representatives at educational seats. The representatives are volunteer members that wish to represent the community at their university and/or surrounding location, and refer members through creative but non-intrusive means. Information will also be provided at various meet-ups, communities, and conferences (example: Mensa, professional/university events, transhumanism meet-ups, tech conferences). The identity of all representatives and their representative location/educational seat will be available to the public on the website alongside contact information for many practical purposes. They will also have a special flair on the forums for similar reasons.\n\n**Financing**\n\nEverything will be run and supported through donations, and all information about expenses and income will be available to all members on the website. Any surplus in finance will be carried over to paying for the next month, and so forth. If the surplus is a considerable amount above several months of maintenance costs, then a democratic discussion will be held on the forums to discuss how to allocate the finances based on what the community believes is rational and necessary.\n\n**Moving Forwad**\n\nIf you wish to be a part of the community as a member and/or be involved in the project with an active role, contact me (preferably by PM as it'll be easier for me to notice and respond). We need representatives, writers, moderators, curators, promoters, et cetera. If you believe you can be useful in another way or role that I have not mentioned, do let me know. If you have any questions, simply ask and I will do my best to answer. Any constructive feedback and criticism is very much appreciated.\n\nExam period is next week, so there is the possibility of delayed response as I am very busy studying at the moment. You can contact me in English, Swedish, Russian, and Korean. I'm fluent in all four.",

Furthermore, those who do get said implants will not be competitive with those who have better models and are thus able to do more. Essentially we have a rich get richer, poor get poorer scenario.\n\nBut of course, we can just have the government regulate it so that everyone has an equal shot (unless they are in government/military work, then upgrades) but then comes another problem. What about the countries that don't regulate? How is American one percenter A going to compete with Chinese oligarch B when Chinese oligarch B is able to pay for higher end enhancements out of pocket?",

        "text": "Greetings from Wire|Head.  \n\nWe’re a Medium publication, and we’re currently looking for writers to submit original works of both fiction and nonfiction to be published. If you’re looking for a place to submit your cyberpunk / futurism / transhumanist story or article, then look no further than Wire|Head.  \n\nWe are looking for short stories or articles that represent or examine the cyberpunk, futurism and transhumanist communities. Fiction would need to be original works. While fan fiction would be considered, please keep the ideas you're representing unique and of your own creation. Articles would need to examine, in depth, a facet of these movements. While there is a growing interest in these communities, \"introduction to\" articles can be found in abundance.   \n\nAs of now, we have no restrictions on length of articles or stories, but do keep in mind that this is a web publication, so this isn't an ideal place to submit a novella or thesis.  You can check out our publication page [here](https://medium.com/wire-head) to get an idea of exactly what we're looking for, or you can message me directly for more details.  \n\nBeing a relatively new publication, we cannot offer any monetary compensation for your submissions, but we can offer a growing audience and like minded viewers to showcase your work to. More than anything, though, we're looking to build our publication, with aspirations of one day turning into an independent online journal, and we would like you to be a part of it.  \n\nTalk to you soon, the editors of Wire | Head",
