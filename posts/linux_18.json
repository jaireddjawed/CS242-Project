I love using the microsoft ink touchscreen for writing mostly mathematical notes and filling out worksheets/review quiz PDFs. All of my notes are currently written in OneNote, but the majority of my notes outside of what is hand-written are all text-based and do not NEED to be written in OneNote. Frankly, I'd prefer to write them elsewhere, but it's easier to keep everything organized in OneNote.\n\nCurrently, the majority of the classes I'm enrolled in are getting me to do extensive Arduino programming, Linux server management and more that I choose to do within a Linux Mint installation in VMware Pro 16 for all of this work. Linux is much more comfortable for all the work that I do. While working with a VM can be a real pain in the ass I wanted to see if there was a linux distro of some kind that enables pen input, and any pen-friendly applications I could pair with that. \n\nThanks so much!",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I have been using Linux based OS's on my desktop for many years now, mainly Ubuntu since it has the best support and the least hassle as far as configuration. I have always thought that learning Linux was an investment that pays off once you reach the point where your workflow becomes vastly more streamlined vs Windows or Mac because of the endless automation and customization options available, but lately I have switched over to Visual Studio Code as my IDE and now I am beginning to doubt if using Linux is really worth it. \n\nI use Linux as my main OS for all productivity tasks (programming, writing, file storage and management, photo editing, video editing, etc). I really like the I3 desktop for its ability to streamline window and workspace management and think that it is much better than Windows in that respect. I used to think that GVIM + command line tools were the best for programming once you crossed the skill barrier, but using VSCode, I don't think that's true any more. As far as general writing, LibreOffice is basically the same on Windows, so there is not much of a difference there. As far as video and photo editing, many open source tools are probably adequete for my amauter uses, but it is the same thing as the writing, these tools are available on Windows and are basically the same. If I ever became more serious about that stuff also i would probably switch over to photoshop and the other industry standard tools because learning those would be a markatable skill. The last big advantage I think Linux has is its file management and software management, which i think is undeniably the best of any system because of the command line tools available.\n\nMy main concern is I am not really sure if these benefits justify the countless hours of troubleshooting and configuration i have had to do to get everything working smoothly. Whether its automating things with simple aliases or bash functions, configuring i3, configuring various subsytems with misc. corks, or simply reading through the man pages of a command to figure out the best way of doing something. It seems like installing and managing all non-GNU software on Linux desktops is a bit more time consuming than on Windows also. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love using Linux for the hobby of it because I find computers really facinating and I like optimizing and customizing things, but I am beginning to doubt whether using Linux is really boasting my productivity. Granted there are other benefits to using Linux, it's free and open source, there are less privacy concerns, it's arguablely more secure depending on the use case, but those benefits aside, what are your guys' reasons for using Linux desktops and do you think they are more productive? Are there any secret tricks to streamlining Linux desktop use that I am not aware of?\n\nThe only reason I made this post is because I am getting a new job soon and my manager wants to know if i want a Linux machine or a Windows one for development and I am hesitant to get a Linux machine just because I know how much time I can \"waste\" fiddling with different desktop configurations and such. I also know that i would be the only one using a Linux machine for development and I do not want to be unable to help my other teammates if they have an issue with their machines.",

        "text": "So, from what I can find online, Linux at large is supposed to use the System V AMD64 psABI. However, there is a BIG discrepancy I have seen someone point out in [This stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65992291/x86-64-system-v-abi-argument-classification-for-parameter-passing), and which I have checked myself. \n\nThe supposed latest psABI specs ([https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI](https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI)) contain the following, with regards to classifying aggregates for argument passing (section 3.2.3, page 24, of the AMD64 ABI 1.0 – December 6, 2022 specs):\n\n&gt; The classification of aggregate (structures and arrays) and union types works as follows:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. If the size of an object is larger than eight eightbytes, or it contains unaligned fields, it has class MEMORY.\n\nHowever, when we look at the gcc source code, we can find this:\n\n    /* On x86-64 we pass structures larger than 64 bytes on the stack.  */\n    if (bytes &gt; 64)\n        return 0;\n\n(source: config/i386/i386.c if you want to check it out)\n\nMaybe I am missing something here, or maybe it uses an older version of the specs, but this to me seems like a big discrepancy, and completely breaks any interoperability I may want to have with gcc compiled code if I follow System V's ABI. It also makes me wonder what other differences there are between the two, which worries me.\n\nSo yeah, basically I wanted to know what x64 ABI does GCC actually use, and where I can find the specs for it.\n\nThanks in advance for the help.",

Also the fact that all the files are just there and you can look and see what’s up with them opens up that black box that a computer was to me when I was young.
