        "text": "The well known Jaws theme (the classic one for when the shark appears) is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because of its immaculate ability to create suspense but also because the theme itself reflects where the shark is. Due to technical difficulties, production had to create innovative ways to show where the shark is as it couldn't be shown too much of the time - this is why the barrels are so efficient and why they were used.   \n\n\nThe music reflects everything about the shark, when the shark goes physically up in the water, the pitch goes up. When it gets closer or further away, the volume changes accordingly - along with the tempo. The horn that is used is meant to represent that the shark has entered attack mode. It is so incredibly perfectly implicative and is such an incredibly smart way to compensate for the fact that they couldn't show the shark too much and had to create ways to show where the shark was.",

It's all about when your movie comes out and what other movies came out in the same year. And sometimes you just get the short end of the stick.",

        "text": "I watched this movie last night and I genuinely don't understand how this isn't a huge cult classic like The Evil Dead. This is a wild psychedelic folk horror movie set in colonial America and it feels like The Witch on mushrooms or an 18th century version of Mandy. This is clearly a low budget movie but the craft and skill involved in the cinematography and editing are way beyond what you would expect from an indie horror flick that was made in the early 80's.  It's a bit of a slow burn and it does take a little while to get to the fun stuff, but once this thing gets cooking, it is some of the best atmospheric horror I've seen in a while.\n\n\nBeyond the aesthetics, it also has some stuff to say and it is an interesting commentary on environmentalism, religion, and the treatment of Native Americans throughout history. I wouldn't say any of that stuff is reinventing the wheel and some of it might be a bit dated considering this movie is 40 years old. \n\n\nOverall, this is wildly underrated and underseen. I can't believe I had never heard of it before and I would encourage you to check it out if you're into folk or psychedelic horror. Certified banger, in my opinion.",

It makes no sense to add a mini teaser showing the ending of the trailer or a big coop scene in the first 5 to 7 seconds. Then we are expected to react to it when it comes but we already saw it in the beginning! I just saw that they did this with transformers rise of the beasts. Yes I know this has been happening for a couple years now which is why I forward the first 5 seconds sometimes. Whoever makes movie trailers and thought this was smart it's not. You just spoil the trailer.",
