        "text": "My girl and I have been together for about 8 months now, and it is the best relationship I’ve ever been in. She has always been so great, and is one of the kindest people I have ever met. \n\nRecently, I have been increasingly anxious about our relationship for some reason. It’s likely due to underlying anxiety/depression and low self esteem I’ve dealt with my entire life. I’m planning on starting therapy, and have talked to my girlfriend a little bit about these issues in the past, and she has been very supportive. I did not talk about however, how I have started to feel insecure in our relationship, and my feelings of low self-esteem. I’ve had thoughts recently that I don’t deserve her and wondering why she is with someone like me. I really don’t know why I’m like this because I know she loves me and I trust her more than any other girl I’ve dated. \n\nShould I bring these feelings up to her? If so, how should I go about it? My gut tells me I should, but I worry these insecurities may be a surprise to her and might be trauma dumping on her too much. I don’t want to give her the impression that this is her fault, or that I expect her to solve the problem. I realize I need to solve these issues on my own but I think it may be valuable to let her know where I am at. \n\nI truly believe there is no reason for me to feel insecure about the relationship. For some reason though, these emotions keep coming up, and I am worried it may damage the relationship in the long run. \n\nTL;DR: should I tell girlfriend about my recent insecurities about our relationship? If so, how should I without dumping it on her, or making it her problem?",

        "text": "I (19 M) started dating a man (41 M) I met on Tinder. I resorted to dating apps because I'm gay.\n\nI'm a 1st year college student.\n\nBasically I told my friend (22 M) about it and he said it was extremely predatory and that I need to get out of the relationship.\n\nHe said he's only 22 and already kind of hesitant to date a 19 year old because of the differences in maturity and life experience in those 3 years alone, and he can't fathom a 41 year old man having anything but predatory intentions wanting to date someone my age.\n\nI said that I'm an adult, and an adult wanting to date other adults is normal. He said,\"Why do you think they go after 18/19 year olds. Because they can't go lower. They like children, they like teens, but they settle for whatever they can do without going to jail.\"\n\nHe asked me if I would date a 14 year old, and I said ew no, they are children. He asked if it was the legality that bothered me, or the differences in physical and mental maturity. I said physical and mental maturity. He insisted the power imabalance, maturity gap between me and a 41 year old man is way larger than that of me and a 14 year old, and a 41 year old man dating someone my age is like me dating someone even younger than 14, likely 11 or 12.\n\nI said his analogy sucks, and that why do we have to be at a similar maturity level. He said maturity levels can differ, but ours differ so massively, it's basically an adult dating a child, and that he only wants to date me because I feel like a young, naive child to him, and that while it may be legal, it is so horribly immoral, and men who do that stuff are a disgrace to society.\n\nI kept arguing back with him insisting that I really like him, and he's the best man I ever met.\n\nMy friend said,\"Look I'm not forcing you to break up with him. Technically yes it's not my relationship. But you need to understand I'm only trying to help you. Really. Just because your \"boyfriend\" can legally get away with it, doesn't matter, it's really just telling to the type of person he is.\n\nI told him I don't want to talk about this anymore. My friend said that if that's my wish, he respects it. He just really wants me to consider everything he told me, and that he hopes I'll change my mind later.\n\nTLDR; So yeah.",

I’m on the phone to someone making a call and the line cut off mid was. I audibly huffed and  to an outsider it may have seemed like I just hung up ( I had hung up on a very abusive client before so maybe Connie knows about this) and Connie looked at Joanna (other member of staff) and I think pointed at me to ask who I was speaking to ans Joanna just across the room said “client”. So because obvs Connie is a stirrer I also said “yeah it’s a client the line cut and I need to call them back” \n\nLater on another person from work came and sat with a group of us at lunch ans rambled on about how unkind she was to people in school and was a bully. Not much has changed in fairness she’s always talking behind someone’s back. She then turned to someone else and said ““we’re you like me too? “\n\nTldr: seriously questionable things happening at work Does this sound like a toxic place to be? Or me just being ott",

Soon to be fiancé…\n\n\nHe was my first kiss &amp; I was his. We spend 24/7 time together, everyday, everywhere. He hugs me, so affectionate &amp; we slept together 2 times. I felt like he actually loved me because I was the first girl to come to his house…cook together…kiss…cuddle…make out.\n\n\nUntil today, he texted me to not text him all day because his sister might seen and had his phone. First time he ever told me this. He told me his sister is going somewhere and apparently she called him too, absolutely bullshit. HE TOOK MY VIRGINITY DAY BEFORE THIS….\n\n\nAs soon as he left, he went to a flower shop and asked me for money. For the flower WHICH WASNT EVEN FOR ME!!! Next thing reserved the best 7 star restaurant WITHOUT ME knowing. I was tracking him everywhere, his taxi rides as well.\n\n\nTL;DR I called the driver and he told me , the guy was alone without no sister, and he had flowers. My heart dropped and my friend &amp; I went to the place. I made sure he didn’t see me. He wasnt with his “cousin”, it was another girl from our school that posted videos of him together with her. (Funny thing) it popped on my tiktok. My friend called him, from a fake number, and he regularly picked up without hesitation. So he had his phone. \n\n\nHe came home, called me of course. He said his cousins came and all. He wasn’t just with her (but he was lol). I have heard seen everything. Im pretending like I didnt see anything, know anything. Going with the flow until I go to his house to explode. \n\n\nShe’s definitely not a friend. He dropped her off home. I personally felt hurt after hearing all proof. I pretended like nothing happened. But I am going to his house soon and I dont know if I should end this?",

In the past I would read online blogs and lurk on forms like r/sex to get general advice and then go with whatever feels right/my partner wants. Generally, I’m super open minded and willing to learn/try new things. \n\nI’ve never had an issue eating girls out in the past, often times being able to have them orgasm, but the problem is my current FWB. There’s no nice way to say this, but I’m just not into her vagina. I never thought this would be the case with lighter skin girls, but her lips are very dark and it just turns me off. Moreover, they’re very flappy, like butterfly wings, as opposed to a petite slit that I’m used to seeing. I don’t mean to sound insensitive, and I would never tell this to her face, but when we have sex the only way I can get off is if we’re doing it from behind and I don’t have to look at it or see it.\n\nSex in general is fine, that’s not really an issue, it’s just more so that I can’t bring myself to put my mouth there. That being said, I don’t want to be selfish and prevent her from being with someone who is actually into her. I know that the right thing to do is to break it off, but I’m not sure what to say.\n\nThis is an FWB situation, neither of us are seeing anyone or looking for a long-term commitment. If I tell her that I’m not interested in doing this anymore she’s going to know the issue will revolve around sex or attraction. I really don’t know what to say, if she asks me why.\n\nTL; DR: I (18M) am no longer attracted to FWB after seeing her vagina. How do I break things off without making her self conscious about her vagina.",

        "text": "I really do not know where to begin. I just see my family crumbling and I feel like Im at a crossroad where I need to pick between my family and my girlfriend (who would have been my soon-to-be fiance). Our families are both Indian and telling our parents is a sign of engagement.\n\nI have been with my girlfriend for 4 years, met in college, etc. My parents both have a long history of heart and health issues, most of which came from stress-induced events. My father \\[74 M\\] has suffered from multiple heart attacks, my mom \\[65 F\\] has suffered from heart rhythm events (atrial flutter/fibrillation). My mother is severely against alcohol. I am not sure what happened but she has a strong stance against alcohol - from what I know, her brothers drank back home, ruined their lives and their wives lives, her sisters lives, reached liver failure, died, etc. and ruined their families. My dad used to drink too and over time he quit because of her as well when we were children. Because of this strong PTSD she has, I was never able to tell her that I socially drink on my own, because even a hint of alcohol made her react so severely that we thought we had to take her to the hospital because of her panic attacks.\n\nMy girlfriends family socially drink - a LOT. Her dad drinks every day, they go to family gatherings (their family is more modern than mine and have a huge family when compared to mine), visit each others houses and drink , etc. My siblings were all against me telling my mom that she and her family drink. I obliged until I felt like I couldn't anymore. My girlfriends dad would not want his daughter to go to a family where she would feel like her lifestyle gets restricted. Knowing that we have restrictions and that she has to hide alcohol in front of my mom and live with her would be a deal breaker for him. She's his only child. My girlfriend likes the social aspect with her family and doesn't want to give it up.\n\nRecently (2-3 months ago) I told my mom first about my girlfriend (dad doesn't know because he would've been harder to convince and need my mothers support first) . At first it was so hard to convince her because of religion differences, etc. That itself took a large amount of time for her to get over. Then, (Stupid me) it got to a point where my soon-to-be fiance needed me to tell my parents that her parents drink. Her parents would not hide it (as they would find it a ridiculous request). So i told my mom and she reacted insanely terrible. Like her life was over. Its been over a month and she wont stop crying, she panics and I see how miserable she is. She wont sleep for more than an hour at a time. I feel terrible.\n\nTo put a halt on this mess, it felt like I had to pick between my family and my girlfriend. The situation at home was so bad and mom wouldn't calm down to the point where I just said fuck it and ill leave my girlfriend if it means so much. I told my brother in law that, which then eventually had to tell my mom that to calm her down because he saw the direction she was going and thought she was going to need to be hospitalized at the rate she was going. I changed my mind a week later and talked to my girlfriend and reconciled. I never wanted to leave her, I just felt forced to in that situation to preserve my mothers health.\n\nTo put it simple, my siblings have given up support for my relationship. Everyone in my family considers me selfish for trying to satisfy her parents comfortability over my mothers PTSD. My oldest sister is married and lives far away. My mother always goes to her to talk whenever she needs support. The things she said to my sister and seeing how I broke our family stressed out my sister so much that she ended up in the hospital for a week, and is at high stroke risk. My second sister, The sister that currently lives in the house with me has already cut me off, told me I knew i shouldn't have done this, and chose their family over our own and me choosing my girlfriend over the sanity of our family. She agreed to be civil for the sake of our parents as they are alive but will cut contact whenever they're gone. She blames me for my sisters hospitalization and my mothers state and says that I am voluntarily \"killing them\" by going back to my girlfriend. My oldest sister is furious i told mom about the alchol, but hasnt cut me out of her life, she wont say that she doesnt support our relationship but deep down I know she hates my girlfriend. Its just so tough when the people who matter to you in your life all disagree on your life choice.\n\nIt would have been completely different if I wasn't expected to live with my parents post marriage. My parents are solely dependent on me. I financially support them completely (I have a good paying job) and help them as a caretaker. If i just abandoned them and decide to elope or something similar, I would be fine financially but they would not be. My parents and siblings sacrificed a lot to raise me and to put me through college and to be where I am today. I would feel guilty my entire life if I just left them abruptly and did that to them.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I see my family crumbling, but I also love this woman to the point where I am ready to have kids with her, get a bigger house ,etc. I am fully committed to her and cannot see myself with anyone else. I cant give another woman the love I gave her. But at the same time I cannot just abandon and go no contact with my entire family. It would crush me and I know what it would do to my elderly parents.I hate this entire situation and don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR : None of my family members support my relationship with my girlfriend. My family is crumbling and I need to decide if I want to stay with my girlfriend and marry her or save my crumbling family and try to rebuild it. I want to have both. Please tell me what you'd do if you were in my shoes.",

        "text": "\nLittle backstory: Me F23, guy in question 10 ish years older. He used to be my direct supervisor for a year and a half. We work in the business that never sleeps, pulling 200-250 hours a month. Were working closely from the very beginning but closer with time as we both got promoted etc. Became very good friends also outside work. He quit a few months ago but we keep in touch.\n\nHe is one of these very nice guys. He would always be there for me if I got in some trouble, we live nearby so at some point he started giving me lifts, when I was moving flats he helped me transport my stuff etc. He is like this with other ppl we used to work with as well.\n\nThis week though, has been so off and now I feel like I am going crazy.\n\nWe met up for some drinks Friday night and I got a bit wasted. He took care of me, got me home safe. I was sick and we were sitting on the stairs near the toilet and he was hugging me a bit and striking my shoulder while I was trying to pull myself together. We hug occasionally in a friendly manner (when saying hi and stuff) so it didn't seem like a big deal. During this evening I mentioned I am gonna sign up for a course to get my driving licence soon and he suggested that we can meet up tomorrow late evening so I can try myself in his car. I said that's cool. Since I had a massive hangover we rescheduled for the next day.\n\nWhen we were driving around he asked if I am working tomorrow because maybe I want to grab some food etc. I start work at six so I took a rain check. He asked if I have any plans after work tomorrow. I said I have to sort out something in the city hall. He offered to pick me up from work and give me a lift there and go for a walk or sth afterwards. I found it a bit off but why not.\n\nThe day after he messaged me again saying that he can give me a lift to the airport (I am going for a holiday in a couple of days). He has also been saying some little things which on their own do not seem too weird but combined make me feel a bit uncomfortable. For the record I am very much not interested in him this way.\n\nHe is still looking for a new job all over the country but he said he really hopes he won't have to relocate as he likes our city and he would be close to me. I dismissed it saying “and to X” (our colleague who is one the same terms with him as myself). He answered “and you” with a big smile and punched my thigh jokingly.\n\nToday is women's day and he messaged me with wishes and said he is sick now but later he will take me somewhere nice.\n\nWhen we were driving the other day he was talking about a hoodie he was wearing and then he said something like “I gotta dress you in it one day so you know how warm it is”\n\nAnd don't get me wrong. I like him as a friend and I like hanging out with him. We have a similar sense of humour so it’s quite fun but three days in a row seems a bit much especially with him texting me everyday. Most of this things he does/says on their own are okay but combined really give me a weird feeling.\n\nX and I were talking today and his name came up. I used it to mention how much he has been talking to me and stuff and to see if he does the same with her. But no, it's only me.\n\nIs something going on or am I reading too much into this?\n\nDon't really wanna ask him because it seems way too weird as I see him more as a friend-mentor. I never did/say anything suggestive and 90% of things/ meetings he initiates.\n\nTLDR: Ex boss has been approaching me a lot and making bit ambiguous comments. Don't know what to think.",

        "text": "\n\nHi. First off, we're Dutch, it's semi-legal here and it's not a big taboo among my peer group. Bf (25m) and I (25f) live together in a rental. I don't smoke weed, he smokes relatively frequently, a few times a month. I'm fine with weed as long as he remains functional and doesn't do it more than twice a week. I think that's very fair and those are the preestablished rules we have. He had a very unhealthy relationship with weed (addictive) a couple of years ago so the rule is also that he tells me or at the very least doesn't lie about pot use.\n\nAbout 10 days ago he had an indoor festival thing he went to with some friends. He used XTC and afterwards smoked some weed to be able to fall asleep. I was aware of this.\n\nTwo days later he also smoked some weed. I was not aware of this but as I was staying with my folks (for unrelated reasons) I didn't really mind. \n\nA day later he tested positive for covid. I went home to take care of him, fortunately he didn't get it bad (I have it too since yesterday). During the whole week I was home, healthy, and caring for him, every time he went to do the laundry in our outdoor shed he'd come back smelling of pot. A few times he had swollen, reddish eyes. I blamed the latter on his illness but I constantly confronted him about the smell. He denied it every time, blamed it on a very stinky grinder he had in the shed (can confirm: grinder stinks up the whole room). I figured I'd let it slide.\n\nCue to less than 10 minutes ago. I'm taking a bath. Our outdoor shed is attached to the outside of the bathroom. The window in this bathroom is literally a pathetic excuse of a frame with single-pane cracked glass in it, so it's like I'm bathing in the outdoors.\n\nI smell weed. Two minutes after that I hear the door of the shed close. I call my boyfriend and ask him if he was outside. He confirmed he was doing laundry. I ask him if he smoked weed. He again denied it, said it was the grinder smell, yada yada. For a couple of minutes he keeps denying it, saying I'm accusing him of doing shit he's not doing, whatever. I tell him \"I know you had some left from the festival. I know you have your reasons. You just started a new job, your girlfriend is sick\". He's quiet for literally a whole 3 minutes and then confesses he smoked just now. After essentially declaring me crazy for smelling pot on him, seeing his watery eyes, etc......\n\nAgain, let me reiterate. I don't mind SMOKING WEED but I sure as hell mind LYIN' ABOUT IT. I seriously saw stars for a moment. It's so unlike him to lie about shit like this. He denied all the other times, but I just can't believe him. Again, he's been addicted to the stuff (inb4 you can't get addicted to weed, true, but you sure as fuck can get addicted to the effects it has on you, and he failed a year of college because he needed pot to function). \n\nI don't know what else he's been lying about. I don't know what to do. Help?????? \n\n(The house is a rental but the landlord is my parents so I am very fortunate that I will not have to move out if the relationship ends.)\n\nTl;dr my bf lied about smoking weed at least once but likely numerous times. This is not normal behaviour for him and I'm freaking out.",

        "text": "I have been at uni for about half a year now and have made a friend who I think I have feelings for.\n\nAt the beginning, I didn't really consider acting on them as my friend group at uni pretty much only consists of him and another mutual friend and I did not think it was likely he would be into me as well or even gay.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago he told me that he and our mutual friend who is lesbian are going to an LGBT event and that he noticed I was going to it as well. There were only limited tickets for that event so it was not intended for allies and from how he talked about the event it definitely seemed like he was a member of the LGBT community as well.\n\nKnowing that he is probably into men as well has made me reconsider whether I should act on my feelings. I feel like he definitely enjoys spending time with me and from what I have heard it seems like there is no other male person he is spending more time with at the moment. Sometimes, we just text for fun even though we are both pretty awkward people who usually don't do things like that. I also know that he is not in a relationship. He also seems to care about me. He texted me when he felt like he was leaving me out of something (when it definitely wasn't) and told me he felt bad about it. He also always seems happy to see me and tells me how he is always looking for me when we are eating lunch at uni.\n\nHowever, sometimes it seems like there are signs he only sees me as a friend. When we did a personality test with our friend, for example, his test results told him whom he could date and he joked that those must mean he can't date anyone of us. I feel like it's unlikely to make that kind of joke if you are romantically interested in someone. In a conversation which in only joined later, it seemed that like he was talking about how he is now or next year statistically at the point of his life where he'll meet his first partner. That also does not seem like something he would say if he had feelings for me.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, our mutual friend's girlfriend was visiting her, she and her girlfriend went to an event. In my and her presence, he told that he got tickets to that event as well and was hoping that he wouldn't only be there with them. I took as a hint that he wanted me to go there with him and asked to join as well. However, for complicated reasons I also sort of panicked and asked if it was ok to come without a date. They obviously said yes, but that way I felt like I was giving him the wrong signals (if it was actually hint). However, later he also said that he was disappointed that some of his other friends didn't come so I am not sure if I was over-interpreting that situation.\n\nIn general, when I am suggesting we do something, he nearly always joins me, but often suggests inviting our friend. I understand that we shouldn't leave her out, but it seems like spending time alone with me does not have a particular appeal.\n\nI really enjoy spending time with him and I feel like he is nicer to me than people I have very long and good friendships with. For this reason, I am really afraid of damaging our friendship and don't know if I should say anything.\n\nTLDR: My crush is most likely gay and I know he isn't in a relationship. I think he really enjoys my company and he is very nice to me, but his behaviour gives me the uncertain impression that he is only having platonic feelings for me. I am thinking about telling him, but don't want to damage our friendship and don't have many other friends at uni besides him.",

Is this a form of “shit testing”? \n\nTDLR; my (27m) gf (27f)makes hurtful comments about things that I do which bring my mood down and I deem unnecessary in the relationship.

        "text": "Context:\n\nMy wife[W26] and I [M26] have been together for 3 years now. \n\nAt the start of our relationship, we were both very much planning for kids in our future. When we got together, she had a copper IUD, so we have planned that when we’re to make the choice for or against, we would have it removed and begin trying. \n\nRecently, due to a variety of factors (politically, selfishly, and, monetarily) we’d been leaning against kids.  My wife went to the gynecologist about a month ago, where we learned her IUD was being pushed out, due to some internal factor, or improper placement from the gynecologist that inserted it. My wife does not do well on hormones and other methods, outside of condoms. All of this  sped up our decision and, as the title suggests we decided the best course of action would be a vasectomy. \n\nOnto the scenario at hand:\nMy parents [M56] and [F54] have not been involved in this decision. My father is mid right leaning, and my mother leans slightly to the right, whereas my wife and I lean left. They are currently aware that we are unsure if we want kids, but have not been updated on the finality of our current decision. \n\nWhen they were told this, my dad said “Oh well to me that feels like the point of marriage, so I don’t know why you’d decided against it.” My mother, the other hand, accepted that news and said she was happy for us one way or the other, but we could tell she was incredibly disheartened. My wife and I are both unsure if either telling them before or after the surgery is the best course of action. I know it’ll break my mother’s heart, but, that’s not a reason to not go through with it. \n\nTo top it off, the surgery is currently in 5 days, and my mother’s birthday is tomorrow, so we will be seeing them in person before the surgery. \n\nShould we tell them or wait?\n\nTL;DR: I’m getting a vasectomy in 5 days, and we’re unsure when we should tell my parents.",

Everything was good between us, except for the fact that he suffers from a lot of mental issues and is in a really bad place mentally. His older brother committed suicide a year or so ago and he still hasn't recovered from that trauma, which is understandable. He is in need of seeing a psychiatrist as soon as possible but unfortunately he can't at the moment because he doesn't have enough money. I helped him financially as much as I could but I can't help him get treated because I don't have that much money and I myself, am seeing a psychiatrist for my own mental issues. In short, our relationship is very complex and we've known each other since we were 12.\n\nHe has a habit of ghosting me for a while, then reappearing a feaw days later apologizing and telling me that the reason he wasn't responding is because he was pretty depressed. That hurt me deeply but I kept trying to be understanding and supportive as much as I could. \n\n2 days ago, he sent me a message saying that he loves me, I reponded with a heart warming message explaining to him that I will never give up on him and that I'll be there for him whenever he needs me. He read the message and then blocked me! I find this so bizarre. I kept trying to contact him to understand what I did wrong but he ignored me. I am just shocked and hurt beyond words. I don't understand his behaviour. If he needed time to himself, he should have explained it to me. I feel horrible and don't know what to do. I can't just forget him and move on without even understanding what went wrong. Any advice is appreciated. Should I keep trying to reach out to him or should I just let it go?\n\nThank you!\n\nTl; dr my boyfriend blocked me without explaining why and I need advice dealing with this situation.",

Got her number with an excuse that I had to send her something we talked about and she smiled when I did that.\n\nI texted her about something random and she replied with really short texts, and she never initiates texting me, which is why I'm doubting myself. Then a week after (there was a holiday), I asked her if she was going to uni coming monday and she said no, but that she'd have to go on wednesday, so we travelled to uni together then (I guess her not just leaving it at \"I'm not going on monday\" might be a sign she's interested?). \nNow this weekend I was back at home, otherwise I might have asked her out then. Instead I asked her last Sunday if she wanted to go again some day this week, she said \"wednesdays if you'd like bc we both have morning classes\". \nWe went this morning and talked but I was super tired (now I'm like fuck why was I so dead, I would talk way more now that I'm a bit more awake lol) and a bit nervous so there was some very slight awkwardness/silence sometimes, although very brief. Also because we were sitting face to face instead of side to side made it harder to be relaxed. \n\nNow just the fact that I'm asking her every time (she's never texted me out of the blue) and that she texts back very short replies (although she responds fairly quickly) makes me hesitant to ask her out, paired with the fact that today was a tiny bit awkward irl just makes it feel not the right time to ask her to do something for instance for tomorrow or the weekend. She does seem interested irl I guess though, she asks personal questions and isn't on her phone when we talk for instance. \n\nIs it fine if I wait till next Wednesday to see her again on the commute and hope for a better more active conversation (scared of waiting too long as well, what if she meets someone in the mean time) which I will try to achieve by drinking a coffee in the morning instead of being tired af lol, or should I just ask her to do something now? \n\nWhat should I do? And if you had to guess, is she interested probably or no?\n\nThe short replies and me asking her every time just make me doubtful about it lol, but she could just not be a texting person and be thinking \"oh he's asking me to do x and y, this is cool\" and maybe not feel the need to ask me as I am clearly (I guess) interested and asking her to do stuff\n\n\nTLDR:\nMet girl on the train, got her number with an excuse because I felt like she was interested. Asked her to travel to uni together which we did, was fun/nice and we laughed and talked. Went again this morning but was a tiny bit awkward at times because I slept poorly and was nervous, should I now just ask her out anyway (which feels \"not right\" as I first want to vibe well the last time I saw her + I'm insecure as she texts really short messages and I am thus far always the one asking her, but she does seem interested irl) or wait till Wednesday to see her again and drink a coffe and have a good/fun conversation again, first?",

I was mid to late 20's and a virgin due to a lot of reasons....nothing religious or virtuous. Mostly due to timing and lack of interest.\n\nThis friend and I were very close but unable to be together mostly due to distance and some other factors. We remained the best of friends throughout and still today.\n\nA few years into our online relationship we met and had sex. I lost my virginity to him. To me it wasn't a big deal. I just never found anyone I wanted to have sex with but I didn't have the mindset that I was keeping it special for anyone. He found out that I was a virgin that time we had sex as my hymen broke.\n\nSo fast forward to today...decades later. We have been friends this whole time and we have started talking about the old days.\n\nHe said to me that if he knew I was a virgin back then, he wouldn't have had sex with me. He said this a few times. He said he went home that day after we had sex and felt like a creep. He then burst into tears talking about it and was quite emotional. He said later that he got emotional about that topic but also just in general thinking about those old times. We've both been reflecting a lot on our lives in general so it's possible the emotions have been building up anyway.\n\nTo me, I just didn't see it was worth mentioning at the time. Much like I'm sure anyone who has sex with someone doesn't announce they've slept with 3, 6, 1 , 2, 7 people. They just have sex. No one announces the notches on their belt do they?\n\nBut seeing his reaction now, I feel terrible and feel like I have done something wrong but been oblivious to it all this time. Part of me feels like I have violated him some how but I am not sure that's the way to view it?\n\nI know there's nothing to do about the situation. I apologised to him and explained my thinking at the time. It's decades later and we're still friends so it hasn't affected that.\n\nSomething is nagging at me that I am not seeing something and I feel so terrible about his reaction all this time later. I feel I have done something to hurt him but can't grasp a concept of what it might be, or if I have done something wrong or not?  I am very confused. I just know I don't like to see him in emotional pain.\n\nIn my mind, I feel and felt fine about it. But the conflict I feel is in seeing how it impacted my friend. I don't want to be ignorant about this.\n\nI would appreciate any insight others have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I'm unsure how to view this experience a friend and I shared.",

        "text": "\nHello! \n\nMy boyfriend (22 M) and I (22 F) have dated for 5 months and I recently have been feeling stumped. \n\nI’m generally a very affectionate person and I really enjoy receiving affirmations and reminders of love. However, my boyfriend is rarely a romantic person. \n\nWhen I raise these concerns to him, he often responds with “I grew up alone most of my life so I’m used to enjoying my own company.” Though I understand his perspective of not being a romantic person, he doesn’t make efforts to calm my worries. \n\nHe can be affectionate when we meet in person, however, he’s rarely affectionate whenever we’re apart. Most of the time, we’re not seeing each other as I have a full time job and he’s busy on the weekends. \n\nWhat hurt me the most was when I was willing to leave early on a Friday to hang out with him but he decided to not hang out because he didn’t want to miss a video game event. We haven’t seen each other in more than two weeks and he didn’t make plans for Valentine’s Day. Because he knew how much of a romantic sap I am, it hurt me when he didn’t even acknowledge Valentine’s Day or make plans knowing it would be so special for us celebrating our first Valentine’s Day together. \n\nI brought up that he could visit me at work during my lunch breaks as he doesn’t have a full time job and is mostly available on the weekdays. He explained that he’s not able to visit because he’s studying for an important exam, however, he often sends me snaps of him playing video games most of the day. He also has been playing a new video game more frequently than usual, leaving him to rarely respond to my messages. \n\nI’ve also been recently sick lately, making me unable to see him but it hurts how he couldn’t drop by at least once to check up one me instead of sending occasional messages.\n\nI feel stuck. I love my boyfriend but I’m beginning to fall out of love because I don’t feel he makes any effort to show that he loves me.  \n\nWhen I raised these concerns again recently, he dismissed it saying it’s not a problem and that we’re still learning love languages. I feel like I am the only one accommodating him while he rarely does anything to improve. \n\nTL;DR should I break up with my bf because he’s very anti-romantic?",

        "text": "My gf (33F) informed me (29F) today that she emailed her ex a music video of people spitting into each others mouths and on each other. Apparently her ex loved doing this while having sex (my gf did not) and she thought it was funny at the time, while being drunk, to email her the video. We have been together for a little over a year and upon her telling me she did this I felt it was very disrespectful to me, for her to contact her ex, especially a video reminiscent to when they used to have sex. This is not the first time she has done something similar while drunk and she gets flirtatious around friends and people which i have communicated my discomfort to her about. Before meeting me she had a one night stand with a friend who she still is in contact with, which i have met and spent time around and occasionally when we have gone out to drink she will get a little too touchy for my comfort with her. \n\nShe also recently informed me that another ex reached out to her with whom she had a long past with and she felt the need to respond and check in on her. I expressed my discomfort with this but she went ahead and texted her anyways. After this i was extremely upset and we tried to discuss the situation where she said i needed to trust her and that she had no romantic feelings towards her ex and only loved and cared about me. Her reaching back out to make sure everything was okay with her ex was not going to turn into anything other than that. \n\nMy gf told me not to be worried and that i am overreacting. I feel as though she is in a sense low key cheating on me. I don’t know what else to do as this is very triggering for me n she has made it clear she will do what she wants n i just need to trust her as she has no romantic interest in any of her exes.\n\nTL;DR-my gf reached out to her exes and thinks I’m overreacting since it made me uncomfortable even though she said she has no romantic feeling towards them.",

        "text": "My (27F) boyfriend (27M) (now ex I guess) blocked me and stopped talking to me without a reason!\n\nUp until 2 days ago, I (27F) was in a relationship with my boyfriend (27M). Everything was good between us, except for the fact that he suffers from a lot of mental issues and is in a really bad place mentally. His older brother committed suicide a year or so ago and he still hasn't recovered from that trauma, which is understandable. He is in need of seeing a psychiatrist as soon as possible but unfortunately he can't at the moment because he doesn't have enough money. I helped him financially as much as I could but I can't help him get treated because I don't have that much money and I myself, am seeing a psychiatrist for my own mental issues. In short, our relationship is very complex and we've known each other since we were 12.\n\nHe has a habit of ghosting me for a while, then reappearing a feaw days later apologizing and telling me that the reason he wasn't responding is because he was pretty depressed. That hurt me deeply but I kept trying to be understanding and supportive as much as I could. \n\n2 days ago, he sent me a message saying that he loves me, I reponded with a heart warming message explaining to him that I will never give up on him and that I'll be there for him whenever he needs me. He read the message and then blocked me! I find this so bizarre. I kept trying to contact him to understand what I did wrong but he ignored me. I am just shocked and hurt beyond words. I don't understand his behaviour. If he needed time to himself, he should have explained it to me. I feel horrible and don't know what to do. I can't just forget him and move on without even understanding what went wrong. Any advice is appreciated. \n\nThank you!\n\nTl; dr my boyfriend blocked me without explaining why and I need advice dealing with this situation.",

        "text": "Long ramble-y post incoming. Last Sunday, my (22F) boyfriend (26M) of just over a year and I had a few drinks at home (a lot) and then a friend of his asked him to go out. I didn’t feel like it so I stayed home but the next morning, he came back into the bedroom and told me that this wasn’t working. I was confused but started packing my stuff (we lived together) and was talking to him trying to understand why because we were really, really happy together. At some point, he told me to stop packing and that he didn’t want me to leave. Then chugged three beers and told me that he had one drunk kiss with some random girl at the bar whose name he doesn’t even remember. I was heartbroken and went to a lifesaving friend’s “for a few days”… which turned into one day before I caved and asked him to talk because I couldn’t stand the uncertainty and I missed him too much. We talked and he told me that he loved me and that he was sorry and that he would do whatever it took to win me and my trust back. And so I went back home. I asked him all of my questions and completely forgave him. Wednesday was rough but Thursday was mostly wonderful and full of love. Friday something changed. He couldn’t look me in the eyes and tried to break up with me. I told him no and that after Thursday, I knew for certain that we could get past it. I guess something I said got through to him because the next morning, he came home from the gym and told me that we were worth it and that he wanted to try. The rest of the day was a little stiff but lightened up as time went on and Sunday was good again. Monday morning, he came into the bedroom while I was still sleeping and just held me and told me how much he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Then he was telling me about how we need to spend less (which I have been saying, especially since he is currently the sole breadwinner and has been since we started dating and moved in together) and that we might need to move to a less expensive apartment complex when our lease runs out next month. I sat next to him during his meetings and he held me. Then something changed that night and I felt him pull away again. All Tuesday (yesterday) he could barely look me in the eye and wouldn’t smile at me or laugh and then the night came and he said that this wasn’t going to work. That he needs to be single and that he needs to work on himself and focus on his career so that he can be where he wants to be when he gets older. He also said that he’s still young and he can’t be fully financially supporting someone else. I’ve been in an embarrassingly long post-grad funk (almost a year now) and have felt awful that he’s been the provider but genuinely was working to change that. I told him that but his mind was set. During the break-up conversation, I asked him if he loved me and he said that he does and I completely believe him, even though it would be easier if I thought he didn’t love me anymore. I took some of my things and am staying at my parents’ house for a few days a couple cities over. I’m planning on getting the rest of my stuff this weekend. I just don’t understand how this happened so quickly and how this could happen since he still loves me. I saw the rest of my life with him. I know that I’ll get through this but I really need advice on how not to fall apart right now. Any advice on getting on my feet with a useless degree (music) in an expensive city (Austin) would also be super appreciated. Austin is my home and I want to stay. I also just booked my first singing gig that is set to start rehearsals in a couple months and is here in Austin.\n\nTLDR; The man I saw my future with and who I lived with broke up with me even though he still loves me. How do I move on and get on my feet when I’m unemployed in Austin?",

        "text": "Buckle up, this might get long.\n\n**TL;DR!:** M*y partner's best friend, who I was also friends with for a while, has recently stopped talking to me for no easily discernable reason and is getting on my parters case about it. We're both unsure what to do about either restoring that friendship or finding another arrangement.* \n\n  \n**Prologue**\n\nI met my partner (who we will call Penny) a little over two years ago when we were in graduate school together. Started off as great friends, hooked up here and there, but didn't start to officially 'date' until we were out of school. A few months after we met she introduced me to her best friend, who we will call Claire (not real name). Claire and Penny had also met in grad school and formed a nice friendship going, and the three of us hit it off really well, started up a group chat, and frequently made plans with each other. While this was going on in the intervening 2 years between when Penny and I met and eventually started dating, Penny and I maintained our own friendship, as she did with Claire. Claire and I would occasionally hang out on our own, but would often chit-chat over text. Things were nice, absent the normal bouts of friend-group drama. \n\nFast forward to about 7 months ago. Claire starts to get on Penny's case because she is having a hard time making heads or tails of what Penny and I are doing, and is finding it uncomfortable to be around us as a group. Penny and I were a bit unsure of what to do about this since we never showed any PDA, didn't arrive/leave together, didn't have any inside jokes, etc. When Claire would come at Penny with this kind of stuff, it was usually worded as an accusation (i.e. \"we were only friends with her so we could date\") that wasn't super backed up by what was happening. She had expressed some anxiety over her two close friends dating and leaving her the third wheel, but never made any attempts to try and rectify that or make the adjustment. We let this all go every time; Penny apologizes, but Claire never says anything to me about it. She's too inflammatory to talk to in the moment, and her insistence on not talking to me at all makes it hard for us to work together. \n\nAs this is going on, the three of us form a nice group for ourselves. Penny and Claire get incredibly close despite frustrations with all the drama, and she starts to give Claire a lot of leeway with the antics. Claire and I go steady as friends, but cracks start to form. She'll occasionally ignore texts, not engage with me when we all hang out and hang out with me only when she needs to ask for something (cat sitter, home repair). I put up with it because Penny doesn't know what to do about it, and because I don't want to ruin their friendship. \n\nIn December, Penny and I had a sit-down and figured out that we both had feelings for each other, but were kinda dancing around them because of the drama. We're happy and excited. Penny tells Claire, and she's tepidly happy for us and expressed that she is just happy we figured it out and are happy. We all make plans to go away on a trip for Claire's birthday. Claire brings her partner of almost a year, and both of us, as couples, have an amazing time and everything seems fine and normal. \n\n**The Unraveling**\n\n2 weeks have gone by since we got back from the birthday trip. Claire had covid for one of those weeks. Penny and I are in the honeymoon phase and are pretty happy with ourselves. Claire sends a massive text accusing Penny of abandoning her since the trip and accusing both of us of failing to make plans with her and leaving her behind now that we're dating.  Keep in mind, 2 weeks ago we spend nearly a week together, and she had covid immediately after. Claire ends the text by asking Penny to not tell me anything, but unknown to her, I'm sitting next to Penny when she gets it. I've seen it. \n\nWe make group plans to have everyone over at my place for a movie night. Told Claire to bring her partner. She bails, saying she doesn't want to be a third wheel. Penny and I don't know what to do. \n\nClaire stops responding to my texts. I get in the habit of reaching out every other day, or so, with either an open question (hows work, Penny told me you were sick, feeling okay?), and maybe get a response once a week. The question is never returned, and she's stopped making an effort to engage with my life and what I have going on. Penny tells me that Claire will only intermittently engage with our relationship when they hang out. Claire will occasionally send me a TikTok or a tweet or something, and I always make a point to respond quickly, but the conversation dies pretty quickly since she won't engage with me or my life. \n\nPenny and I have a conversation about how this is kinda really frustrating and hurtful for me. Claire, I was tight and it was really hard for me to have that friendship fall apart in a way that left me feeling incredibly anxious about what I did/didn't do to cause that. Penny feels like her hands are tied since this isn't her fight to wage, and she doesn't know how to approach Claire in a way that won't set her off. We decide that it's probably best that I send her a message just saying that my feelings are a little hurt by how things have been going and that I'd like to talk about it. \n\nI send it. I never got a response. It's been nearly a month since that text. \n\n**The question**\n\nClaire has made a bunch of comments to Penny about how she'd like to do something as a group, along with other comments that convey that she still sees me as a friend. I've maintained with Penny that I don't really trust Claire and that I'm really not sure how she's appraising the situation between her and me if she isn't talking to me but is still interested in making plans that involve me. Penny feels incredibly stuck since she, knowing my side of the situation as well, feels like Claire isn't being honest with her. Neither of us knows what to do. \n\nIt's a mess of a situation. I understand that it's never the easiest thing when your two friends start to date, but this all seems a little extreme and unnecessary.  Penny has kinda come to terms with the fact that she's maybe given too much leeway to Claire's behavior, and that I've given it too many free passes. We've both talked to friends about it independently and they're both confused and frustrated by it as well. Penny and I are pretty lockstep on things, and she doesn't want to ask me to breach the conversation again since Claire is the one who's ignoring my feelings and what I had to say.\n\nIs there something I'm not seeing here?",

Legally this is ok but it just feels a little weird. \n\nAny advice? TL;DR what should we as friends do?  And what do you think?",

        "text": "I am a man in his 30ies and I have a wide family in two countries. She  is my distant cousin, about 10 years younger than me, from the family  brunch in the other country.  \nLast time we met, in a family reunion,  she was too young to remember me. She only knows me through stories by  her mother and older siblings who know me much better, as we had other  meetings since then.  \n\n\nRecently, her mother told us she is worried  about her: She lost motivation to finish university after two big  break-ups with boys and covid. She now has a new boyfriend (whom she met  online) and she started talking about leaving university to just be  with him.  \nHe also appears to have some extremist socio-political  ideas, my cousin never expressed before, but she says they agree in  everything. Her mother believes he found her vulnerable and desperate  for love and he manipulates her. She is so much in love, she listens to  nobody.  \n\n\nI don't know the guy and I don't want to be preoccupied, but all this sounds like a red flag to me, too.  \nOf course it is totally understandable that when your mother doesn't like your boyfriend, you don't want to discuss it with her.  \n\n\nAnyway,  I have some experience, so I thought I may be able to help. We may  don't know each other, but she is my family and I care about her. And  family means to offer your help unconditionally, even without being  asked first.  \nI decided to do my own research first, going to the  source: her social media profiles. I needed to see her side and read  what kind of ideas she expresses online, myself. I googled her full name  but I couldn't find her social media profiles. She uses a nickname, I  thought and I stopped.  \nA few weeks later, I decided to try again.  This time I opened and analysed every single page her full name appears  and I discovered her nicknames (at least some of them).  \n\n\nIt turns out she really needs my advice. Not about her bf, but about her life:  \n\n\nShe shares too much information about herself and she doesn't know when to stop. This has been proved too bad for her anonymity.  \n(People,  please, if you want to protect your anonymity online, don't use the  same nicknames/avatars/signatures/email addresses in profiles you share  with irl friends/family/colleagues, don't share your personal pictures,  don't post about where you live/what you do irl.)  \n\n\nShe wants a  life partner to start a family with - which is wonderful - but her  description of it sounds more like a teenage dream fairytale fantasy  than a real life scenario.  \nIt's not bad to have dreams, it's good,  but we need to be practical too. She used to blame society for not being  able to live her fairytale, when the real problem was in her, not in  society: Before she is ready to be a mother and successfully raise  children, she needs to be mature enough to be able to protect them,  guide them, advise them, be their rock through life. She can't do that  if she is like a child herself.  \n\n\nShe trusts easily online  \"influencers\". She treats them as some kind of wise grand gurus of life  and she feels blessed if she gets their attention, when they are nothing  more than ordinary next-door people, only a few years older than her,  who just have the ability to promote themselves. Some are even fake  ones, who's actual lifestyles are the complete opposite than the  lifestyles (or the ideas) they promote.  \nFor example, a girl who  claims to be voluntarily unemployed, spending her day doing offline  activities, while in reality she is officially an employee of an  influencer company and she earns money by making professional videos  advertising commercial products.  \n(I don't know how many of you are aware that a 10 min video like those, has many hours of hard work behind.)  \n\n\nShe  shares her innermost thoughts and details about everything: her likes,  her dislikes, her dreams, her insecurities, her sex life, how  desperately she wants to find love, her obvious ignorance of how men  think, etc.  \nThis way she makes herself vulnerable to anybody who may want to take advantage of her and break her heart.  \n\n\nShe  used to post nudes and amateur porn of herself in an nsfw subreddit and  delete them after a few days, during the pandemic. Unfortunately, she  has been recognised by some people.  \nI don't judge her. My first  girlfriend did something similar before she met me and I have an  understanding ever since. Besides, we live in the 21st century, it's her  absolute right. It's those people who gave her out and shared her  photos without her permission who should be judged. But unfortunately  not everybody think this way.  \n(Girls, please, if you really want to  share your nudes/porn and never be recognised, don't use the same  username/email address/etc you use elsewhere, don't post your face or  details of your body/clothing/your room that may be recognisable, don't  use this identity to talk about things you usually do.  \nAnd never  forget: If you are beautiful, your content will be downloaded and saved  as a precious treasure, especially if they know you are going to delete  it later.  \nMen will never ask for nudes, a woman they respect. If they  know you share them and they respect you, they may ask you why a  respectable woman like you is doing something like this, to get the  answer that these two are unrelated.)  \n\n\nSome people are mercilessly  making fun of her, because of all of the above, and she doesn't seem to  really understand why they do it. She says she doesn't care what they  say, but I don't believe her. She just doesn't want to admit it publicly  and she doesn't know how to stop it, so she just accepts it. But I  know. And I can help.  \nShe has some online \"friends\" telling her they  do it just because they are jealous of her and that she doesn't need to  change anything. Those \"friends\" are either immature people like her,  who can't see the problem, or they just don't care about her and they  enjoy the \"fun\".  \n\n\nI also discovered good things, that make me really proud of her being my family:  \n\n\nShe  had a tough time through school and university. She had been bullied,  she had been depressed, but she is strong and doesn't loose her  authenticity and passion to be herself.  \nShe is empathetic and she is always ready to offer her knowledge to help those who need it.  \nHer  socio-political views are rooted in her genuine desire for equality,  justice and to make this world a better, fairer and happier place for  everyone. She just lacks the historical knowledge and substantiation to  support them. I would really enjoy to discuss everything about this  topic with her.  \n\n\nMy problem now is, some of the above are so  personal and sensitive info, she may wouldn't want anyone in the family  to know. When I began searching I didn't expect to find these things.  \nI  feel guilty that I violated her privacy, although I didn't really do,  since it's all public. I only found what anybody who knows her name can  find. I would never open her notebook or her browsing history or  anything else that is hers without her permission, because I value  people's privacy.  \nI am autistic and I didn't think that maybe this is  wrong until I read the whole thing and I started wondering what to tell  her. All I was thinking was that I want to help her to improve herself  and be happy with the scenario of life she choose to have. And in order  to do this, the first step is to collect all the information that is  publicly available.  \nMy family is the most important thing I have in  my life and I don't want to wreck it. But I can't pretend I don't know  and do nothing, when I know she needs help. I have to somehow help her. I  know I can because I have done it before for other people. I'm ready to  do it again, this time for a family member.  \nPerhaps right now I am  the only person in the world who can do it, because I doubt anybody else  in the family knows what I just discovered. And I think I should not  tell anyone without her permission.  \nOn the other hand, maybe that's  exactly what she hopes to happen: Someone who cares about her to  discover all this and approach her about it, relieving her of the  uncomfortable position to do it herself. She knows very well she is no  longer anonymous.  \n\n\nSo I'm here to ask you this: If you were this  girl and you received an unsolicited message from a distant cousin of  yours, who you don't really know personally, and he reveals to you that  he knows all this stuff about you and he wants to help you, how would  you feel? Would you feel loved or betrayed? Would you think of me as a  trustworthy relative or as a creepy stalker and you'd rather not to hear  of me ever again?  \n\n\nFeel free to post your answer here or to contact me privately if you prefer this way. I don't mind.  \n\n\ntl;dr:  I found her social media and read all her posts. Nobody knows I did.  She needs advice and I can give it to her. I need to tell her what I did  without upsetting her.",

        "text": "td;lr \nI am having a strong urge to reach out to my ex boyfriend whose heart I broke and I was very toxic to, but reaching out will do more harm than good; here to vent\n\n\n\nIm going to name change, I 32F can’t stop thinking about my ex, drew (34M). I’m not sure the point of this post but feel like it’s the only place to purge this from my mind. We started dating in high school, we were very similar, in a toxic way. We both had traumatic childhoods. Both wild, passionate, hard headed. There was never physical or mental abuse but we did both cheat on eachother. We were emotionally not a good fit. It was impossible for one of us to end things, we just could never say the words “we are done.” All this time, I have never run into him despite both living in the same area. I haven’t really thought about him at all in all these years. My sister saw him about 6 years ago and he asked about me and told her his marriage was bad, that is really the only time I heard his name at all. We were comfortable around eachother. We had great sex, and we had fun, but both insecure. When I think of us, I think of hurt. Not all the happy times. I am not sure where this deep constant thought is coming from. It’s almost like a need. An urgency. It’s driving me crazy. Our break up was slow, and painful. For him. I started hanging out with the man who would quickly become the love of my life. Who was fun and patient and calm, he was everything I needed and wanted. But throughout this, I was still stringing drew along. Not quite ending it but staying just present enough to give him hope. I think he believed I was going out and possibly dating, but I don’t think he knew that I was fully in love and committed to someone else. I know he was filling his time with a girl from work, which I completed ignored because it gave him something else to focus on; instead of driving by my place and blowing my phone up. Then 9 months into my new relationship; I found out I was pregnant. I was 20- almost 21 at this point. And Although scared, it eventually became a happy time. The thing is, I couldn’t tell drew. I was still stringing him along. He couldn’t get ahold of me by phone, so he would email me. Begging to just hear my voice, to see me, to see his dogs, telling me he loves me. I would email him back every few weeks telling him I will always love him but we couldn’t be together and that I hope we could be friends one day. I still could not tell him I was pregnant. Then out of the blue, i was about 5 months along, I get an email, in the subject line “congratulations” - when I say my heart fell into stomach. He knew. I opened it; it was short and filled with anger. I remember crying for weeks, not because he found out, but I couldn’t believe how badly I had fucked up. How could I have not told him? How could I have put him through that and letting him find out from someone else? If the roles were reversed I would have just died of heartbreak. I called him one day when I was about 8 months along. I told him I was going to come see him. So I did. I was huge and pregnant, I remember the absolute heartbreak in his eyes when he saw me, saw my round stomach, saw that it was all real. His voice cracked and he said “I didn’t know you were so far along” realizing that I had been with someone else for longer than he originally thought. We talked for a bit and I left. He continued to text me til my baby was about 7 months old. Telling me he would love and raise her with me, that he wants to be together. Eventually after not replying after so long he stopped texting and calling, and we never spoke again. I was young, and stupid. We both were. I have grown a lot since then, I have healed myself through therapy and having kids has changed me in a way nothing else could. Which only makes the mistakes of my past and the hurt I brought onto others even worse. I can’t stop thinking about him and dreaming about him. Not in a cheating sort of way either. I just don’t know, I needed to get this out because the feeling and urge to see and talk to him is so strong. Stronger than anything else I have ever felt. He ended up with a girl he used to work with. I just know he is unhappy, even since the beginning, if I would have asked him to be together he would have left her. Which is why opening this door would not be beneficial for him, it could potentially destroy his home. I don’t want that. Even tho I feel like I owe him some kind of peace or closure. I know he picked up drinking when I put him through all that, and last I knew he still had a pretty sloppy issue with drinking. I just don’t want him to go through life wondering what if, or holding on to all of that heaviness. We were so wild and so triggering for eachother but the love and passion was so fierce. I hate that we can’t be friends, I hate that we went through so much and still to this day he knows more about me than anyone else. I wish it wasn’t like this. I hope you are happy drew, I hope one day we are both at a place that we can have a conversation.",

But now we've reached a boiling point, and we don't know where to go from here.\n\nFirst things first, a little information about my gf: She's (mildly) autistic, she has ADHD and has been far more sexually active then i have been in the past. The reason for this is that she's been using sex and intimacy as (how she puts it) a form of self-harm, and adding value to herself. This has caused some mental issues that are, because we've been together, bubbeling up. Causing her to not feel sexual at all.\n\nShe had hope that these issues would pass after we had sex, which has not been the case.\n\nWe talked about it a little while ago now, but simply don't really know where to go from here. As the both of us don't want to break up.\n\nShe's tried therapy before, but says that it doesn't work for her, and that it's too expensive.\n\nI've offered to explore more unorthodox ways of being intimate, such as watching a show together or reading the same books together, as a way of showing affection without actually having to touch one another. But she isn't sure if that would work, and feels like it would be unfair towards me since physical touch is my primairy love language. I'm a very patient guy, and don't mind having to wait for her to heal to a point where she can accept being intimate and sexual in a more \"normal\" way, but she still feels like it would hurt me, or damage our relationship.\n\nI really don't know how to help her feel better, but don't want to give up the relationship either\n\ntl;dr: She's having issues with intimacy because of past trauma, and doesn't know how to process it. but doesn't want to break up either",

The greatest kid ever made, facts. \n  So I work full time from home while taking care of the boo and his dad works out of the house. It's been a lot on me, feels like I'm doing a bad job all around - being a momma, an employee, and keeping the house functional. I rarely get a break, maybe 40 minutes to eat by myself when his dad gets home.\n  Anyways - we have had the opportunity to have 3 'date' nights since the boo arrived. And every single time it goes down the exact same way. \nIt's the end of the day and I'm covered in baby drool, haven't  showered yet that day. Still gotta get baby ready to go. Hubs says he wants me to something sexy but I just want to sit down. Baby gets dropped off. Ask each other 8 times what do you want to eat until I decide (usually take out). Hubs asks me what he can do to turn me on. Wants me to go put on something sexy. Asks what he can wear that will turn me on? Asks what my fantasies are. Asks \"there's nothing you want to do to me\"? MULTIPLE TIMES. Asks if I want to use toys. Do I want to tie him up? Why am I not telling him what to do? Asking me: you have no imagination? There's nothing at all? Do I want him to get naked and clean? Will that turn me on? \n\nYeah no absolutely not turned on. \n\n\n\n I will just sit there, how awkward is that? Asking someone to be turned on? Over and over. My answers are usually I don't know or really? Walking around the empty house aimlessly asking me what he can do to turn me on. To me it's weird, he doesn't even try and kiss me.\nI work two full time jobs and one is basically a 23 hour shift. I'm effing tired. And when we get a 3 hour break all he wants to do is have some bizarre orgy. He says he wants it to last.  And we have sex 3-4 times a week already. \n \n I just don't understand. IT'S SO AWKWARD!!!!!! After the 10th question I want to say \"will you just effing stop and let's get this over with?\" I'd rather have the time alone than be badgered. \n\n  At this point my fantasy is sitting on the couch and watching one tv show in entirety or going out to dinner and watching movie without being asked what my fantasy is over and over. \n\n TL/DR My hubs spends our alone time asking what turns me on relentlessly, when all I want to do is hang out.",

        "text": "We had this argument the other day and we kind of broke up. Basically the issue started when she kept making these \"jokes\" about breaking up with me and leaving me forever. She would always talk about how much she loves me and doesn't want to lose me, but then would make jokes like that. I tried asking her why she was making those jokes and she said that she's just being silly. These jokes would come out of nowhere and were really confusing for me, I explained to her that I don't like jokes like that, and to please not make them. But then a few days later she started doing again and I told her \"that's not funny, I told you that I don't appreciate those jokes\" and also told her that if something is bothering her, just say what it is.\n\nShe did apologize, but instead of trying to understand why it hurt me, her \"apology\" was like \"sorry, I thought you would've known by now that I'm just a silly person\". And I told her how it's not a funny thing to joke about, and she was like \"I said sorry already, I don't know what else you want\". And then at that point I told her that I couldn't be with someone who makes \"jokes\" about dumping me.\n\nWe haven't spoken since and I feel kind of guilty about it. Maybe I was overreacting but I did tell her already that I didn't like those jokes and she'd make them anyway. And, I didn't appreciate how she'd try to gaslight me, making it out to be like me getting hurt is all my fault for not recognizing that she's just a \"silly person\". However I do miss her and sometimes think it really is my fault. Honestly I could use some advice, I'm wondering how I handled it and also what I could do better if this situation happens again. \n\nTL;DR: broke up with GF over her making hurtful jokes that she knew I didn't like, now feel guilty and am wondering if I could've handled things better.",

The greatest kid ever made, facts. \nSo I work full time from home while taking care of the boo and his dad works out of the house. It's been a lot on me, feels like I'm doing a bad job all around - being a momma, an employee, and keeping the house functional. I rarely get a break, maybe 40 minutes to eat by myself when his dad gets home.\n Anyways - we have had the opportunity to have 3 'date' nights since the boo arrived. And every single time it goes down the exact same way. \nIt's the end of the day and I'm covered in baby drool, haven't  showered yet that day \nGotta get baby ready to go\nHubs says he wants me to something sexy but I just want to sit down \nBaby gets dropped off\nAsk each other 8 times what do you want to eat until I decide (usually take out)\nHubs asks me what he can do to turn me on\nWants me to go put on something sexy\nAsks what he can wear that will turn me on\nAsks what my fantasies are\nAsk \"there's nothing you want to do to me\"? MULTIPLE TIMES\nAsks if I want to use toys\nDo I want him to get naked and clean? Will that turn me on? \n\nYeah no absolutely not turned on. \n\n\n\nI will just sit there, how awkward is that? Asking someone to be turned on? Over and over. My answers are usually I don't know or really? Walking around the empty house aimlessly asking me what he can do to turn me on. To me it's weird, he doesn't even try and kiss me.\nI work two full time jobs and one is basically a 23 hour shift. I'm effing tired. And when we get a 3 hour break all he wants to do is have some bizarre orgy. He says he wants it to last.  And we have sex 3-4 times a week already. \n\nI just don't understand. IT'S SO AWKWARD!!!!!! After the 10th question I want to say \"will you just effing stop and let's get this over with?\" I'd rather have the time alone than be badgered. \n\n At this point my fantasy is sitting on the couch and watching one tv show in entirety or going out to dinner and watching movie without being asked what my fantasy is over and over. \n\nTL/DR My hubs spends our alone time asking what turns me on relentlessly, when all I want to do is hang out.",

I was not perfect either but I’ve worked on my communication skills and worked hard to grow as a person. He has done so many hurtful things that I now, today would never accept, I’ve learnt a lot these months. \n\nHe always says he will do better, a month ago he said that this time he would put in all of his energy and efforts. I gave him a month and it was better for a week. The final straw was when I told him a few days ago that I feel like he hasn’t put a lot of effort in to our conversations and not telling me much at all. He then proceeded to flip the problem onto me, saying he did so because he thought I was mad at him and that what “I did” was not ok. I told him that I’m tired of repeating the same things over and over again. I also said that I felt like he didn’t understand what I meant and THEN he just switched the subject asking how my day was? He hasn’t told me that he loves me in 8 months so last time I brought it up crying, he said that he will think about it. Now he only says “I love you more each day” during arguments, not “I love you” randomly. \n\nAnyways, I don’t know how to break up because I feel like it’s my fault and that he will tell all his friends that “I’m the bad guy”. I’ve never broken up with someone before and I’m afraid that his comforting words and hugs will make me give him another chance. But deep down I know I’m done. \n\nTLDR; I’m breaking up with my bf of two years, but don’t know how I’ll manage to do it",

        "text": "My wife (34F) and I (34M) would’ve been celebrating our 10-year anniversary in May. But last month, I asked her to move out.\n\nI'll skip over the drama (there’s a whole thing if you’re interested) because the main point is more important. In a nutshell, we’d been treading water for years, trying to stay above the surface. I did everything I could to save it, but she refused to engage or work to maintain the relationship, forcing me to spend most of my time walking on eggshells to make sure I didn’t do something to upset her.\n\nAnd then I saw a screenshot of this tweet from @ chenchenwrites:\n\n“i do not want to be merely tolerated or accepted. what miserably low standards. i want to be celebrated. i wanted to be asked serious questions. i want to be asked about my dreams and desires, my sorrows and my favorite trees. i want to be wanted. actively. abundantly. today.”\n\nIt was a gut punch to realize that I was, at best, merely being tolerated – that she had become entirely uninterested in me as a person, and that we’d been coasting on the familiarity and inertia of our time together.\n\nIt struck me that I (hopefully) still have more than half of my life ahead of me, and when I looked over at her ignoring me on the couch, I decided that even though I love her, I absolutely could not spend that time in a life like this. She didn’t do it intentionally, but she had conditioned me to make myself very small and acquiesce to her whims while never feeling comfortable advocating for myself because I knew she would respond negatively. I had to socially isolate myself because she refused to engage with my friends and I was made to feel bad for leaving her home alone. Her subtle body-shaming gradually warped my self-esteem (we're both attractive people, but it'd been a dead bedroom for years). And any difficult conversation I ever tried to have resulted in her either stonewalling or finding a way to blame me.\n\nThe idea of an emotionally healthy relationship where both partners can productively discuss their thoughts and feelings was almost unfathomable to me. But during this time on my own, I’ve discovered that I still have a network of wonderful friends who leapt at the chance to support me and hold the space for me to not be okay. I've made new friends, and I’m learning how to ask for help. I've even connected with some on a more intimate level as I navigate what it means to be single again after so many years, and have been floored by how incredible it is to have mature, productive conversations about emotions and expectations.\n\nAll in all, every day is getting easier. I wanted to share this with you in case you’ve been experiencing something similar. **Don’t settle for merely being tolerated!**\n\np.s. Naturally, you’re only getting a portion of one side here. I’m sure she has her own narrative, but she has never been forthcoming with it. I want to stress that I still deeply care about her and hope she is happy in the new life she has chosen to live. Mercifully, the divorce is amicable and uncontested (with no kids!!), and we're sharing custody of the dog.\n\ntl;dr: My wife wasn’t interested in maintaining the relationship and I decided to end it after realizing how low my standard had fallen thanks to a tweet. The title’s a little glib.",

My mother lives downtown in that city and to get to her house by car takes at least an hour. With traffic and finding parking it's usually closer to 1.5 hours. I hate the traffic in the city, which is why I live in the suburbs so I find driving to her house stressful in general. Driving with our two young kids in the car makes it even worse. They get bored and restless and I really don't like having them stuck in their car seats for so long. So we don't drive down to my mom's that often right now, which she is always making passive aggressive comments about and trying to make us feel guilty for not visiting more often. \n\nI have tried to explain to her that I don't think it's good for the girls to be in the car that long (2-3 hours for a return trip) and that I also hate the drive, but she doesn't accept this as a valid reason. \n\nShe doesn't have a car herself so if she wants to come visit us she needs to take a bus or come up with my brother, who lives about 10 minutes from her house in the city. She has a friend who also goes on \"outings\" with her, that has driven her a few times.\n\nHow can I make my mom more understanding about the difficulties in visiting her? Is there something I could do better or different myself?",

My bf lives alone, so I spend the weekends over at his house. Last weekend while I was there I asked him if I could use his gymcard, becuase he doesn't use it right now. He said sure.\n\nWell Sunday morning he told me his bestfriend asked for the card and he gave it to him for 2 weeks. I got upset, because he already told me I could have it, and I told him so. Now I know it's his card so he can give it to anyone he wants, but I was still upset. He does this thing where if I'm mad he keeps trying to hug me and kiss me, so I tell him no. Afterwards he got super mad and left his own appartment, leaving me there without any explanation.\n\nAfter he left I also left, no use in staying in his appartment if he's not there. While in the car he called and told me I had 2 choices, either I stop being mad and pick him up or I can go home. He didn't get why I was upset and kept saying he didn't promise me anything and if I want it that bad he would get it back. I answered that it's fine I will just use my sister's card, but that it's the principle for me and if he would've just said sorry I would've forgotten about it already.\n\nHe told me to go home and calm down, so I did. Now after I was home he asked if I would be going to our reservation at the restaurant that evening, I told him no.\n\nMonday comes and he doesn't text, I send him a picture of my hair in the afternoon, he ignores me. Tuesday comes and I text him asking if he's going to text me and try to solve this or if he doesn't want to fix it anymore, still no answer. Wednesday (today) I don't send him any messages and he doesn't either. It's stressing me out and I'm not sure what to do.\n\nHe has done this a couple of times in the past and it has always been about stuff that he's kept on his mind from previous arguments, that he doesn't tell me, after which he explodes and ignores me. I'm at my wits' end.\n\nI want to apologize for my childish reaction, but I can't because he's ignoring me.\n\nWhat should I do about this situation?\n\nTLDR; BF is ignoring me after a stupid fight.",

        "text": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nThe first two years of our relationship were euphoric, I (28M) finally found someone (28F) who meshed with my personality, shared the same type of humor, and I felt genuine unconditionally love from (hard to find because of my background). But the last year, we moved to countries on the opposite sides of the world following graduate school to pursue opportunities we couldn't pass up. These weren't permanent jobs, so we planned to do long distance, and everything quickly fell apart. The time difference made communication difficult, and our schedules and workload made us quick to agitate and point fingers when issues came up. Just my POV, but she became jealous and controlling (she's been cheated previously and has underlying trust issues she's acknowledged) and I began cutting off friends and bottling up my emotions because I didn't like fighting. We were both miserable, clinging on to this shred of romance that was quickly fading away until one day we had decided it would be best to end it before we truly hated each other. I guess I never really processed the split, choosing to internalize everything into my work, reconnect with friends, and work on myself.\n\nWe broke up nearly two years ago and went completely no contact for the following year. She reached out last year to just chat and I'm truly embarrassed to admit how good it made me feel. She was my best friend and over the next year we began to talk more and more. She told me about her daily life, that she spent the time apart going to therapy to work out many of the issues that she felt contributed to our split, and reminiscing on our relationship. I restructured my schedule the last 6 months just so we could talk on the phone to sleep (Tragedy Incoming ). I truly fell in love with the person she became and secretly applied to a job near her which was way above my expertise and figured I'd leave it up to a higher power to give me an answer. I got my offer 3 days ago, and before I could even tell her, she called crying saying she hadn't been honest. She had been in a relationship for the past year and felt trapped, because he was a good guy but she just didn't feel that connection. She talked about how she would leave her current situation in an instance if I somehow moved back to her country and we could start over (Why does he have to send mixed signals).\n\nThis truly broke me, the girl I fell in love with this past year had been essentially doing the most untrustworthy thing in a relationship to her current boyfriend while I was about to move my entire life to be with her. I'm fucking 28 and am supposed to be a fucking man, but I've spent the last couple days ugly crying and eating entire deep dish pizzas (I Love Chicago). I'm not sure if I can take the job anymore and am even less sure that I can date/trust her given the situation. I've always heard that the relationships which start in treachery (cheating in this case) will end in treachery. I know it's probably best I just focus on myself and move on, but I love her so incredibly much it's hard to see myself with anybody else. I've dated casually and I can't stop using her as a benchmark for others. I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to do what I know I have to do. \n\nAnybody else go through a similar situation? \n\nIs it feasible to start something with her? Or am I just being overly emotional and hopeful?\n\nPlease tell me it gets better. I really need it.\n\nTL;DR: We split. Worked on ourselves apart. Reconnected virtually and I fell in love again. Got a job in her country just to find out she's been in a relationship for a year.",
