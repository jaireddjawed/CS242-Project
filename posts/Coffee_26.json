Do you?\n\nMy thought for this week is the irony of coffee 'origination'. For most people it doesn't matter were the coffee beans come from, only that they come from *somewhere*.\n\nThere's no real preference for Kenya over Costa Rica, just that it must have an origin somewhere. This is in opposition to most other foods and beverage where the specific origin (e.g. Champagne) is essential to 'quality'.\n\n## Equipment\n\n* [Anfim launch their latest commercial grinder for sale](https://www.anfim-milano.com/en/product/luna)\n* [Gruppo Cimbali release their technicians' taste wheel](https://www.comunicaffe.com/gruppo-cimbali-launches-the-coffee-technician-wheel/)\n\n[The Wheels on the Parameters Classification go round and round](https://preview.redd.it/vbtvvfpgmdfa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=970217c36296cfa8eb9fae43b89c3ab1d3c4d0a9)\n\n## Industry\n\n* [Flash-frozen coffee start up is spending up to $160k a month on influencers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/01/30/cometeer-coffee-pods-layoffs-ceo-switch/?sh=7cea84a16c64)\n\n*I'm all for new coffee start up companies and hardware is still always hard.

Trying to reduce my expenses, I'm coming back to making coffee at home and quitting the energy drinks and gas station coffee.\n\nSo I cleaned my coffee maker today. I first ran through some vinegar and water solution. Then after that I have been running through plain water. The issue is that I keep getting black, floaties in the pot. They look like old bits of coffee grounds honestly. I put in a filter and it cought all the visible debris.\n\nMy questions are: has anyone dealt with this before? Doesn't matter how many times I try to flush it, there is more debris and it weirdly seems a consistent amount. If I use a filter and make coffee, is it safe to start drinking out of? \n\nThanks in advance",

All I can say is holy cow!

Three to four times per grind, I am shaking the grinder, thumping the side of it with the heel of my hand, and opening it because I think the beans are fully ground.  No. they're just hung up above the burrs.\n\nI think I surfed through another thread that suggested using different beans.  Well, this is a roaster and varietal that I REALLY LIKE.  I feel like such an exceptional machine should be able to handle them.  Added details, I am grinding for a French press..started grinding at 50, then worked my way backwards to 45 and now finally 42.  The beans are somewhat oily, promoted as wet processing / Fully washed and Giling Basah, and sundried.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience?  Any feedback or help?!",

I have two small kids so the quieter grind and value for money are leading me to manual at the moment and waiting for birthday/holidays to ask for a nicer electric one. Espresso upgrade would be nice,  but my wife's pallete isn't super sophisticated, and the Cuisinart is sufficient for her right now. I mostly do pour over, and sometimes French press.\n\nMy main question, is there a quality grinder that tends to hold up the best to provide good value used or a diamond in the rough to look out for at thrift shops? I would ideally spend between $50-75 for used. Or would a cheaper one in that price range new get me by until the gifting seasons?",

        "text": "I have been tweaking my French press method for a few months now to try and achieve the best cup of coffee possible, and today I can honestly say what I am drinking now is absolutely bliss! I start by boiling a pot of bottled water. Once that water is at rolling boil, grind the coffee. I only use dark roast whole beans, preferably Italian of French roast. I use a median coarse grind. Enough grind so there is a little fluff towards the bottom but some chuckies on top. I use 3/4 cup of coffee. The grind is very important! Also, grind right before you add water, do not let it sit in the grinder for more than 30 sec. Set a timer for 5 min and start the timer. Add just enough water to cover the top of the coffee in the press. Put the top on to hold the heat, wait 45 seconds. Then add just a little more water, about the same amount you put in to cover the coffee the first time. then repat that until it's a little bit over a 25 oz. Around 26-28 oz. After the time goes off, SLOWLY press the coffee. It takes me around a min to press the coffee. I like to use vanilla extract and heavy cream with a good amount of golden sugar. I know some people will hate me for the cream and sugar but that's the way I like it. This is the absolute best cup of joe every time, never fails. I thought I would share this bit of knowledge and preference to the world. Enjoy!",

Just got set up with a Gaggia Classic, Eureka Mignon Sinlenzio and all the other bits I need. \n\nReady to get the machine up and going today but I want to select the proper beans for me.\n\nI have been doing a lot of research and understand that freshly roasted beans are important.\n\nSo I have gone out to a few coffee shops that use freshly roasted beans.  Indeed the one in my town roasts in a building next to their café.  They sell these beans online and in the shop. \n\nHowever, after ordering an array of espresso drinks there including a double espresso, macchiato, cappuccino and an americano just to get some tastes of the coffee, I don't like it at all.  \n\nWhat I don't know is if I am just way to new to this to understand what good is or their barista's aren't very good with the machines?  Like, could this be good coffee and I just don't get it?  To me their coffee attacked the hell out of my tongue and the taste lingered for hours.  \n\nOr could this just be the roast being bad?\n\nI ask because this could be a great way for me to get freshly roasted coffee on the regular and if it is just the barista's not being great I can safely get some beans there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is, and I know this will get me a lot of flack, but the worst part is so far of all the espresso I have tasted I like the Starbucks the best.  It has this dark sweet flavor to me that goes oh so well with some properly frothed milk.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think I should just try some of their freshly roasted beans and go for it?  Or maybe find something else online?  Because at this point I am inclined to buy some Whole bean starbucks espresso roast and just see where that gets me and forgo all of the knowledge telling me that fresh roasted and roast dates are important.  \n\nIt isn't like I have no experience with coffee, it is just that my main experience with Espresso is via Starbucks and through foods and such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do know that it is possible that I just haven't developed a taste for true fresh roasted espresso.  For instance, when I started smoking cigars, they just tasted all the same to me, and left me feeling like my mouth was an ashtray, but over the course of a couple months or so I was able to tell what I was smoking and could tell the differences in them and that first cigar I smoked ended up tasting phenomenal once my tastes had developed.  Could that be the case here?  Or could it just be bad coffee.  \n\nI could use some advice, and would appreciate it a lot.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "TL;DR: Trying to perfect making Vietnamese Iced Coffee at home. Looking for help with a precise recipe and deciding on the right sized phin filter.\n\nVietnamese Iced Coffee is great. It's simple, delicious, easy and extremely low cost of entry compared to specialty coffee when it comes to equipment.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the instructions aren't very precise. It's not exactly specialty coffee so I understand the informal steps, since it seems like the amount of condensed milk is typically eyeballed and adjusted to taste, as well as \"filling water to top of the phin\". \n\nMy issue is - phin filters vary in size. I believe it is 4 oz traditionally, but I do see 8 oz and up to 24 ounce phin filters. The recipes aren't proportional either, since the capacity of the phin dictates the surface area of the filter, thus having an impact extraction rate. \n\nI'm interested in a yield of 6 ounce, and possibly a recipe for an 8-12 ounce yield as well. \n\nCurrently I have Trung Nguyen Premium Blend for the coffee and Eagle Brand condensed milk. I am looking advice in deciding which size phin filter I should go with for my desired result. \n\nI'm also looking for a recipe that would provide for a good, consistent taste that I'd get from buying at a traditional cafe. If the amount of condensed milk, grounds and water (for bloom AND brew separately) could be provided in Grams, I'd love that! Most of the instructions vary from teaspoons, grams, ounces and measuring by inches in the same article and it's difficult to follow along. \n\nI'd love to purchase from this supplier. They have 4, 6, 8, 11 and 15 oz filters as options. Help me pick the best one!\n https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/ref=asc_df_B01AK11S7C/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198107422705&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=18081760167342548011&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9005547&amp;hvtargid=pla-350119612208&amp;psc=1&amp;region_id=674469",

Even with my shitty setup (hario skerton and v60 with a standard kettle), I got some incredible floral fruity results. It was almost like elderflower tea, but coffee. \n\nSo obviously I bought a bunch of Ethiopian beans back then, and loved them all. \n\nBut I find that now, 5 ish years later, Ethiopian beans are much more boring, mellow, closer to stone fruits in taste, and just not the same. And this is the exact same beans from the same roasters than what I used back in the days. \n\nSo, what happened? Has Ethiopian coffee fallen off its throne, or has multiple local roasters forgotten how to roast correctly?\n\nWhat should I try to get that very light, bright, elderflower tasting/smelling beans again?",

However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.\n\nThere are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:\n\n- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.\n\n- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.\n\n- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!\n\n- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.\n\n- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.\n\n- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.\n\n- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.\n\n- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals.

I wanted a classic drip machine. \n\nI have a Nespresso but espresso flavor is *too* strong. I had a Keurig but the flavor was too water &amp; weak. All I want is a moderate cup of coffee! \n\nI don’t know what I’m doing wrong with this drip machine. I bought coffee beans which I’ve been grinding in a nutribullet. \n\nAny types on how to get a good cup of coffee that isn’t watery from a drip machine? Also open to any ground blends you might recommend?",
