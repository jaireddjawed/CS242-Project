        "text": "The title is exactly as it sounds, something is stalking me. I have always been sensitive to these spiritual events. I've been seeing and feeling things since I was a little girl, I always thought it was this cool gift I had, but I have never dealt with something so confident until now. No matter how negative the entity was surrounding me I could always get rid of them but this won't leave. Okay let me start at the beginning. It started a few weeks ago, I was on my way home from work late around 1 am this hour is usual for me to come home so I wasn't tired or anything but I got this insanely bad feeling rush over me so I tried to ignore it, but the whole ride home I felt someone in the backseat of my car watching me but there was no one there. When I parked my car I had this overwhelming feeling telling me not to leave my car. I was freaked so I called my boyfriend to stay with me in case something happened. With him on the phone, I got out of the car and something told me to run and I did as soon as I got in my house I locked the door and I felt something push back trying to open the door. My boyfriend tried to calm me down and I tried to forget it and go to sleep. Fast forward a week, I felt like I was being watched, having vivid nightmares and hearing strange noises from outside that didn't come from any animal because I live in the middle of nowhere and the only animals we have on my tiny island are farm animals, snakes, and donkeys but I ignored it until I was in my mum's room talking to her and from the corner of my eye I saw it standing there watching me outside the window but I ignored it not wanting to freak my mum out. Two days later I was locking up my house and outside I was its silhouette watching me. My mum said I turned white as soon as I saw it and was worried so I finally told her what happened. She told me that since it's only been outside maybe it can't enter the house and it's as if it heard what she was saying because I woke up at 5am to it standing in the corner of my room watching me. My phone was drained and shut off, it had used the energy from my phone to manifest itself. I share a room with my sister and it was using her she turned to me still asleep and started laughing at me. I started yelling at it to stop using her, the laughing stopped but it was still there. It had big yellow buggish eyes, gray skin, so skinny you can clearly see the ribs, there were bloody scars and scratches all over its body, it was smiling at me and its teeth were sharp, not a kind smile but malevolent. I kept repeating my prayers but it wouldn't go away and usually they do. It just stopped smiling it kept watching. I felt like it was taking over my thoughts, trying to let itself in. Eventually I closed my eyes because looking at it was making me sick and I kept praying and that was it I felt it leave but not before leaving a bang on my door. I didn't sleep after that and all day there has been this dark energy surrounding me. I don't know what this is, for the first time in my life I don't know what to do I have never dealt with something so confident. I need answers. Also if someone could draw out what this looks like so I can show my parents I would appreciate it so much. Any answers would be helpful. Thank you.",

I heard snoring across the room where my closet is, the snoring sounded familiar to my brother's but he wasn't there, I couldn't tell what it was, my dog wasn't there and none of my family was there. I had my xbox and TV on so I just blocked out the sound by watching tv with headphones, I lifted them after a little while but it was still there, once it turned 4 am the sound was gone. What could this have been? I wasn't that concerned but it was pretty weird. If a ghost is just tryna sleep because he's exhausted then be my guest just don't snore that loud lol.",

        "text": "This isn't a lie please don't let this post die.\nI will start by apologizing for my poor command of English but I am not a native. I'm sorry if I didn't write a lot but it's 1am and I'm tired. \nMy story is the following.  I grew up in Mexico even though I am American.  When I was very young I discovered that I was what many call special, or perhaps some religions would call me a messiah for the gifts that were given to me at birth.  The one that appeared first was the fact that he could see people who were already dead or he could also somehow see how Lucia looked at a place in a specific past time, many times or rather most of the time he saw when something bad happened in that place.  I still remember that I told my parents about it, the logical thing to do was to take me to a psychologist and the psychologist after almost a year of what my mom referred to as just wasting money, he said that my \"problem\" needed treatment, I went to see a psychiatrist three times a week for three years, the diagnosis was schizophrenia, although even with the meds I kept \"hallucinating things\".  I remember that my grandmother, who is religious, took me to a healing and liberation group at a Catholic church. The first thing was that they sent the doctor to take a few blood and urine tests, as well as x-rays of my head and body, so that I could rule out that my problem was due to something physical, from there they took me to another psychologist and two more psychiatrists to rule out anything mental, the process was completely free, we never paid a penny for anything, from there it was a month of presentation in the part of healing to be able to move on to the liberation or exorcism part, and I have to say that the healing part begins before the doctors because they \"analyze\" you to see what kind of treatment you need, since they not only help you with the supernatural but also also with the physical and mental completely free no matter who you are.  But hey, when I began my liberation stage, they interviewed me and it was where I explained everything I had been through and what my \"powers\" were, I said that I could see deceased people or also transport the vision to other places, one more is that of Being able to know what you are thinking or the one of healing and for which many would call me a saint, in addition to others that although I have them I cannot control them and they are more ramdon than anything else, that was where they discovered that I was \"special\", I They analyzed and put me to the test, to be able to know if I was not just lying or if I was really who I said I was, and in the end I passed the tests that the Catholic Church did, after that they sent me to two years of preparation to learn what was the liberation and healing, although I learned to do both, I almost never did the healing part, I always got liberation which I hated for everything I could see or feel.  I would like to tell some things that happened but I took a vow of silence and I don't know if I should tell any of the cases, since there were some much better than horror movies (and if I still get scared when watching any horror movie).  I'm writing this because I know that there are a few people like me, and I want to talk to them about how they lead their lives.\nI would also like to examine myself in a laboratory to find out how my body works, although I have to accept that I am quite afraid of ending up kidnapped by the government, but maybe if we manage to figure out how to control this, we can create a new civilization of humans, I have I'm afraid of what will happen, but I want to see if someone can help me contact the right people.",

        "text": "The first 8 years of my life my siblings and I were raised by my grandparents in Hopkinton, MA (where the marathon begins!). They lived in a very old, historical house built in the early 1800’s (link below). It was said that Lincoln’s former maids were the first to occupy, and records show that in the early 1900’s, a woman had died during a fire in the attic. I absolutely loved growing up in that house, but my Nana hung all of the old photos of the maids throughout the house and they looked quite spooky. \n\nOne night when I was 5, I was sharing the king-sized guest bed with one of my brothers when I saw a white figure wearing a long dress and a bonnet appear in the entrance way across and to the right of the bed. I said, “papa?” thinking it was my first grandfather whom had died before I was born. The figure moved slowly over to the bed, and folded over the blankets and sheets as one might due when stripping a bed, exposing my torso to the cold draft. I instantly froze and looked over at my brother who was still asleep. I watched the ghost exist through the door, and closed my eyes absolutely batshit scared. I had a really intense flashback of visiting Florida when I was 2, but cognitive memory does not really allow memories to stick from this age. \n\nIn the morning I told my nana and she laughed stating I wish being silly. I was SO upset because I knew what I had experienced was real. \n\nYears later at thanksgiving, I overheard my grandmother telling one of my cousins’ boyfriends that the house was indeed haunted, and the photo of the maid who died always fell off the wall when she would hang it up in any room other than the kitchen. She also saw laundry being folded mid-air in that same guest room twice. \n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/gdx6NBBTs9GBwuN76?g_st=ic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gdx6NBBTs9GBwuN76?g_st=ic)",

So strange that thier disbelief is supported effortlessly by thier relative absurdity to \"normal\" (which by the way is a totally subjective concept based only on individual experience and group reference; it not VALID by ANY logic)\n\nI have many times experienced very unlikely (astronomically so) coincidence (the word means occuring in relation to, NOT randomly) that has lead to confusion, suspicions, and paranoia. This was not helped by my habit of being intoxicated in various way in the past which makes even my own experience fall under speculation to myself.\n\nNow that my sobriety and mental state are NOT contributing something i witnessed mirroring past events recently was very concerning an psychologically offsetting.  Lets just say that in a short period something happened is which around one hundred small things involving my observation by others occured.  The included very odd behavior of people in vehicles using non thru traffic areas to watch and follow me and also thier more bizarre actions when i notice and act erratically or try to confront them.  Sometimes they run taking routes no tegular driver has reason to use.  Other times thay freeze in an unreasonable place or action to stop at for long periods.\n\nThis culminated in a wholly choreographed scene in a store where when i took unexpected action or paces it upset the actions and people literally ran to take positions and then take pointless actions like grab pack of dental floss for instance.  Why would someone run past me and from me to grab floss then immediately follow to take place behind me in the checkout like in which the checkout of 4 items of the person in front of me was stalled for 7 minutes without obvious reason or concern by anyone?\n\nIm am well grounded...not crazy.",

        "text": "This is the first time I write this experience in the internet and I'm doing it because of a recent post about someone who thought his mind might have been read, it inspired me to share my own experience about this subject. Also before starting I'd like to clarify that I'm not a full believer of all the paranormal it just amaze and entertains me, now having say so as people say in my country: \"De que vuelan, vuelan.\"  \n\n\nI was 12 at the time I met a girl that is cousin of one of my, at the time, friends. She lived far from my house but during the weekends she used to visit her grandmother at my friend's house, that's how we met, she became my girlfriend after a while... she is older than me, at the time she was 14. The day I ask her to be my girlfriend (A normal practice kids do at that age in Venezuela). She kissed me after saying yes, and I say she did it because even though I had had other \"girlfriends\" The most daring thing I had done at that time with them  was grab her by the hand. Whatever, the important thing here is, the kiss took me by surprise, when the kiss happened an intrusive thought got in my mind, not words but images, it was about something really embarrassing and personal that to this day I haven't tell anyone, is something I prefer carrying to the tomb with me. What happened to a 12 years old that is so bad to this day he can't say it? Well in the world shit happens my friends, don't ask is just too personal, the main point is: Intrusive images in my mind when we kissed the first time.  \n\n\nI know you can already think is over you may be thinking \"for sure she told him that secret he has, whatever\". Yeah but read the full experience, there's still a little more in this.  \n\n\nSo, we we're together for two months, I broke up with her to be honest can't even remember why, and she lived far so as vacations when over we didn't see each other as much as before. As I started knowing her I realize she was completely normal like me (we used to talk in the phone for hours) she used to tell me about her family, her house, etc. Pretty normal, but time to time she would tell me about some weird stuff that she can fell, nothing specific just that she is more sensitive to certain things related to paranormal, she had always been like this and at one point of her like a so called \"witch\", let me explain this term a little bit before continuing, a witch in Venezuela and most parts of Latin America is not a woman doing satanic rituals, is someone who sell her services for good or bad, is paganism if you want to see that way not necessarily bad people, but not normal people that for sure, now, this \"witch\" told my girlfriend's mom pretty early on that her kids (my girlfriend) was special in a way that she can be possessed by spirit and be a channel for communicating with them, I can't remember how we call that in spanish, at the time she told me while she was telling me all this, but rn I can't remember so let's keep going. The \"witch\" (that I think was friend of her mom, but I'm not sure at all) told her mom that she could do it but need someone to train her, and she wanted to do it, she wanted to train her, thing that she never did at least no that I know, we hardly told after we broke up.  \n\n\nSo we broke up, some time passed like a few months, I stopped being friend with her cousin and I didn't end up in good terms with her. Now another friend told me \"Alicia told me that when you guys kissed the first time, you were thinking in .......\" (I'm using the Alicia as her name but is not her real name) So, I'll be honest, my friend was making fun of me really hard, you know the deal, I told him she was wrong and crazy blah blah blah. She wasn't wrong at all, she was completely, 100% accurate even though they both didn't have a way to knew that, to this day they don't have any reason to know that. It spook the heck out me, I got really scared. And tried to never speak with her ever again. I saw her a couple time more and chitchat one time I ran into her in a store. So that's the story, may seem like bullshit and I know it doesn't seem like a big deal for you but to this day it is what keeps that spark on me that there are thing we just don't know how to measure yet and we can't study properly. thank for reading and sorry for my shitty english.",

        "text": "I’m 21. My dreams are very fragmented and don’t always follow a clear plot. However, last night while I was sleeping I had a very vivid nightmare of a man dressed up in a white Easter bunny suit with a bow tie, coming up the stairs and reaching for my door. I watched from my bed as he approached my room. He casted shadows of tall costumed ears against the walls of the hallway. When he entered my room, we momentarily stared at each other whilst I laid in bed. I went cold. I was terrified. Suddenly he launched for me, grabbed me and was attempting to kill me. I remember being suffocated by large furry arms, and I tried fighting back. I was convinced that by his breathing and movements that there was a human man underneath. But when I somehow managed to pull the head off the costume, there was nothing but stuffing inside. The being ceased movement after that and I just stared at the severed head. It all felt so tangible.\n\nI can’t remember what happened in-between. \n\nAlmost directly after though, I was laying down in bed again when I saw a large furry white foot place a step by my doorway. It was the same costumed being again, entering my room. This time it immediately came for me. I tried reaching for my knife under the bed but it dragged me by the legs across the room with such a force, and hauled me towards them. I think I didn’t survive this time. I woke up screaming.\n\nUpon searching for similar experiences, I’m finding other stories on Reddit like mine. Most of those having been seen by children though. Why does this uncanny man-like easter bunny figure seem to be such a universal encounter? \n\nFor context: I’m not religious. There haven’t been any mentions of Easter or images of the Easter bunny I could have seen recently. The stores are packed with Valentine’s Day products and advertisements. I’m not American. I haven’t participated in an Easter event since I was 5 and even then it was purely about chocolate. I don’t use reddit much and very rarely see scary story or video content. So why did I see this Easter bunny man, and why was he evil?",

        "text": "This was probably the worst night of my life, and the only times I've experienced anything even close to paranormal. I'm 15 years old with a little bit of a childish mind, and live in the countryside; not completely in the middle of nowhere but the houses are spaced out pretty well. This was, if I remember, mid October, and of course we had our decorations out as well as our 2 scarecrows that we already had. I'll call them Harold and Sally. We've had these scarecrows for as long as I can remember as per decoration for inside the house, and neither of them freaked me out unless I was sneaking some ice cream and got spooked by Harold in the backroom, of course shrugging it off and talking to them like I usually do such as \"Oh you scared me!\" How do these two pertain to the story? You'll find out. One day, my mom brought home a rather cute scarecrow, at least she thought it was. I'll call it Mable for this story. I felt uneasy being around the new scarecrow, trying to think nothing of it, even though I knew something was off because I'd never had an immediate phobia of scarecrows like that, I even liked the idea of my dad making scarecrows in the cornfields surrounding our house or in the garden even though it never happened. Well, my parents went to sleep pretty easily, although I was restless, I eventually went to sleep. Around about 2:56 in the morning, I woke up, and thought I heard something. My TV couldn't have woken me up because it didn't do its daily update quite yet, and even throughout the jumpscares of the game play I was listening to while I slept, the volume was at least on 19 and it didn't bother me anyways because oddly enough, the TV being on and me knowing what was on allowed me to sleep without dreaming. I thought nothing of whatever I probably heard and woke up late to and tried to go back to sleep.. until I heard it again. It sounded like some sort of rustling sound. I'm a very paranoid and protective person, so thinking it was someone in the house I grabbed my baseball bat and went into the den and through the kitchen. Realizing it was all in my head, I got something to drink out of the fridge when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye, I looked over, it was the scarecrow, Mable. I saw its arm move, that was enough to scare me shitless. Both my parents and my sister were asleep, and my dog was in my mom's room, and I shit you not, that thing was NOWHERE near a register and the air was NOT kicked on. After I saw it move once more, I basically ran into my mom's room crying and screaming at the top of my lungs to get her to wake up, and at first she thought I was bullshitting her, but realized I was telling the truth and let me sleep in the room she was in. As much as I begged her not to stay in the living room and sleep, she did it anyways. That night, I had the worst nightmare imaginable. The nightmare consisted of me checking on my mom in the middle of the night to find her bloody corpse collapsed in the middle of the floor, with probably 100 stab wounds, and the scarecrow was gone off of its post, nowhere to be seen. I basically bolted out of the room the next morning to check on my mom, and I may sound batshit crazy when I say this, thankfully my mom was okay, and Mable was still on her post. After that my mom, being the more understanding person, asked my dad to put Mable in the garage. (Our garage isn't connected to the house) Even though I had a feeling rush over me that we should burn it, my family didn't, but thankfully nothing like this happened again. This was probably one of the worst experiences of my life and I hope to God that they never take that thing out of the garage. I'll update everyone if anyone is interested or if anything changes.",

It's more like I'm sensing a big change that is going to happen. I can't sleep all night long, but I also feel in a way like I'm in a dream and the next morning I don't feel tired at all. I'm just moving a lot in bed, I can't find my place, I can't make my body relax and fall asleep. When this happens I never ever realize that \"it's happening\", I just realize it when during the next day I get the news.

        "text": "Hey just started following this sub and wanted to post about an experience my wife and I had a few years back. I’m generally very skeptical about this stuff and always find an explanation somehow generally however this was a long shot. \n\nWe had a small one bedroom apartment in the city. It was one of those high rise buildings with hundreds of units and we were about in the middle of the building with plenty of units above and below. It was night time and we had gotten into an argument so she went into the living room to get some space and I was in the bedroom. I hear her scream like crazy out of know where and run into the living room with my heart beating out of my chest. My wife is usually a rock and doesn’t scare easily let alone scream. She was just laying on the couch with all the lights off just on her phone. The tv was on as well but just a blue screen. The source was all wrong like generally you turn it on and it goes straight to hdmi 1 or whatever but it was just a blue screen. She said the tv just turned on randomly by itself. I said maybe she’s sitting on the remote but we found it laying on the tv stand. \n\nMy brain tried to find additional theories such as maybe a neighbors remote connected to our tv and turned it on somehow even though the range seems like it would be short especially going through the wall or floor. Perhaps it was a software update or something else.\n\nRegardless I’ll never know for sure what that was about and we forgot our argument and both went to bed after that. It’s experiences like this that make me believe there is at least more to this universe than we yet understand. \n\nAnyone else have any weird experiences with t.vs or electronics? I had another one as a kid but am curious about others or if there is an actual reason stuff will turn on by itself or act weird.",

He started transforming all together into something that was no longer my great grandfather and it was making a weird yelling sound that terrified me. It soon turned into an empty wheel chair in the back of a dark room which still creeped me out. I kept calling out to Jesus and finally woke up and had a tingling sensation deep in my throat. I prayed and prayed and was able to feel peace again and fell back to sleep. It was a very scary experience.",

I searched all of this before because my oldest (18yo) has been convinced that the basement is haunted for a while now. \n\nThe bassinet I was messing with is used and been passed down a couple of times now. My son hated it and so did my niece. Is it possible for the bassinet to be what it’s attached to? If so can I cleanse a bassinet? I don’t want to pass it on to someone else if it’s haunted.",

        "text": "This incident took place 3 years ago (I am 18 now). To give you guys a better understanding of the event I shall briefly explain certain instances and digress a bit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in a suburban neighborhood and have quite the population density around me. My house is located next to a local highway and I have habituated myself to it. The traffic does not disperse until 11pm during the weekdays and 9pm on Sundays. My room is on the second floor in my house. Since my house was built by my grandparents it has a sort of a 70's look to it. The windows in my room are obnoxiously big and are not sound proof in the very least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt might sound normal (except for the large windows) to have this sort of room all to myself but the thing is it's \"exorbitant\".\n\nTo make it clear there are three doors in my room. In my opinion I don't think these many doors would be necessary. Anyways, other than the one obvious door I use to move in and out of the room the second door opens to an open balcony while the third one is used to connect my room to a bathroom (which also has an entrance door).\n\nWell here's the thing, there is an unnecessary passage between the door to the bathroom and the entrance door of the bathroom (I don't know why this was done). My father was a little thoughtful and designed a cabinet for me to keep my stuff. Due to the door being old the casing on the doorframe worn off, we removed the casing. Now all I could do was just partially close the door.\n\nMy bathroom's entrance door has such a small doorknob that I don't bother closing it. I only close the primary door that connects my room to the bathroom. Speaking of my bathroom it is well ventilated as there is a rabbit hole sized opening made in the wall where a fan is attached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn some days it gets a bit breezy and since I don't bother to close the bathroom door the breeze travels through the passage and hits the en-suite door (lets just call this \"the door\" from now on). This makes \"the door\" nudge away slightly and leaves me with a slight view of the gap between the top door frame and the top rail (I'll refer to this as \"the gap\" from now).\n\nIt is quite an eerie sight as I always wonder if its really the wind playing tricks or something else. My parents really didn't bother to fix it as they wanted to renovate the house on a whole in about a year so they said I'd have to live with it for now. There have been some occasions where I witness \"the door\" open itself. But I usually don't bother because I have been experiencing this since I started my adolescence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I couldn't forget about this one quiet night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI brushed my teeth and headed straight to bed as it was 11pm and I was really sleepy that night. I remember I slept facing the side away from the door like I always do. It was really comfortable that windy night and I dozed off quickly. Or so I thought...\n\nI remember waking up and rubbing my eyes only to find myself facing the side of \"the door\" and just as I expected \"the gap\" was there but it was completely dark so I couldn't clearly make it out as it was pitch black inside compared to the darkness that surrounded my room. However there were two bright white dots that were fixated right at the center of \"the gap\". I was not afraid at that time but curious as to what it could be. I was not able to move my body in the slightest possible way. All I did was stare at it, at God knows how long. My eyes were just gazing deep into the white bright dots.\n\nI know this might seem like eyes but just think about the fact that these white dots were shining bright like those headlights you would find on jeeps. The next thing I remember was waking up with a sore neck. Needless to say I am quite fortunate that I have never really experienced anything else similar to this except for one other instance but I'll probably post a narration about that incident another time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that this could have also just been a dream or a nightmare (whatever you want to call it). A few years later I came across this term \"sleep paralysis\" and I think it might have been the case. There are a few people I have shared this incident with because to some extent I find this incident comical. I am fairly new to this subreddit and I felt that sharing this incident would probably give you a good read. As of now I am totally fine and I am doing well. Thank you for reading :).",

So if I remember it was around either 8:30 AM or 9:00 can’t remember. But I decided to check my nightmare of a closet that if someone opened my closet, it could cause an avalanche, and it took awhile but I eventually found it, my old camera that I’m now calling, Ol’ Reliable. But anyways, I decided to ask my mom if she can put the film in it (that I found in my closet) and even though she was about to leave, she still did, and when I went upstairs I noticed that our/my cat Spooky (who is a black cat in case y’all were wondering) staring into my dads office, so I decided to take a picture. And after I shook the photo and at first it did nothing so I put it in my desk drawer for a few minutes, but after I took it out, I noticed something in the photo that I didn’t notice before, there in the darkness, was a face, (that in my opinion looked like Ambush from Doors) and I am the type of person who believes in the paranormal, and even has a secret Gmail paranormal investigation group chat on my school chrome-book, and also dealing with a case of my own, (more on that in a different post) but I like to call that “The Basement Incident“ anyway I was shocked, so I showed it to my sister, (she, my dad, and me were the only ones home at the time) and all she said was “it’s just the cat, and it’s just your imagination“ but what kinda cat looks not only like Ambush from doors, but also like birdo frame Super Mario Bros 2.",

When I walked in my room, I got this overwhelming sense that something terrible happened there- had chills, felt sick etc.  I tried to take a bath to relax and ants started crawling out of the walls and over the sink and through the tiles in the shower surrounding the tub. Something was telling me to GET OUT of that hotel room. It had super high ceilings and all I could think of were horrible thoughts of people hanging from the ceiling and dying in the room. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. I called the front desk and made up a lie so I could switch rooms. When I walked out and shut the door I felt an overwhelming sense of calm. \nWas this just my spidey sense that maybe something bad had happened there? Has anyone else had anything like this? Do the ants coming out of nowhere mean anything?",

So I keep the lights on and later that day requested an acquaintance to sleep the night in my apartment. After 7 days things become normal so they left.\nIn January 2022, I get up intermittently from sleep without any reason, this is new as I am a heavy sleeper. Then one night I can distinctly hear the sound of mortar pastel from my kitchen, which is adjacent to my bedroom. I live alone in a 1BHK apartment. It filled me with dread. It was 1.50am. despite the late night I called my uncle on phone and told him. He has some knowledge regarding paranormal. He called me on video call and saw every nook and corner of my apartment. After investigation he told it might be some dream and to sleep. But that mortar pastel sound continued from that night. I bring friends to sleep in my apartment and they too can hear it along with the vibration of a heavy mortar pastel.\nMy parents didn't believe it, so I was called by my uncle to the big city for a thorough  audio checkup, then psychological evaluation. All turned up normal. Still I was prescribed some sleeping meds . That same night my uncle's whole building vibrates with mortar and pastel sound. He investigated everywhere and did some chanting. It silenced after sometime. From then on we spent money like crazy on people who claims they can stop it. Desperate people are easy prey. I was on 2 months leave in another city in my parents house and  they too can hear it. \nOne old man gave me an amulet after which the sound stops following me and I felt less dread. But it still continues from the kitchen.\nThose who don't know what mortar and pastel is it's like a loud metal knocking sound.\nCan anyone please help me sort this out.",

I was wondering if maybe someone will have some kind of an idea as to wtaf I saw or it was. Basically everything was pretty normal and was being normal, it gets to maybe midnight maybe just a little later, I get woken up from a light, not blinding or overly bright but just a light. I got out of my bed and there is just a door, not like a house door, I can only describe it as something supernatural, it was in a terraced house and behind the wall would have been the neighbours house no space for anything to have been behind a door, it had a small window like thing to the top part of the door that the light was coming through, obviously I looked through, and everything in there was just white, completely white, I couldn't make out any walls or ceiling or floor, just endless white, there were also things that seemed to be living just floating about I'm not sure what they were but they were much darker and appeared almost black, they seemed to have a kind of humanoid form from the top half but the bottom part I couldn't say as it seemed like theyhad ragged robes kind of. Now I was rather petrified at the time so got no closer and didn't investigate any further, I've told people about this and nobody has believed me playing it off as a dream but I can tell you for a fact it was not a dream, everything was way to real and perfectly placed around the room, plus I forget dreams almost immediately. Since people I've told haven't been all that much help I turn to you Reddit",

I didn't care much since paranormal stuff doesn't bother me, it just got annoying while trying to read or watch stuff so I called a buddy who gave me a \"sentence\" to read and the next thing I knew there is a blacked out creature with a huge torso (bigger than a dump truck), no legs, 4 or 6 really long arms (46-49 feet long), long neck, no face and red eyes that were staring at me. This thing had me fearing for my life as it just towered behind a gravel pile staying out of the one light source on site. I had my brother show up to my job since his truck had more lights then my little car. After leaving my job that thing chased after me till we drove past the \"witch's tree\" on Colorado's haunted road. After talking to said buddy he said he got the words from a friends witchcraft book and after he asking her I had to wear a pure silver pentagram necklace for 2 years. Would anyone happen to know what exactly that creature was?",

What i saw under the sheets was a Samara look alike lady that suddenly teleported in front of me and i inevitably looked at her. And you Guessed It, her eyes were Red. What Is this all about? Does this have a meaning? And yes i tend to look at some horror stuff but i almost never Watch any movie.

And through my right there was a wall but few meters ahead on the same wall was a doorway with no doors. Saw a Medusa like tree...  \n\n\nAnd I was dressed in black having shortness of breath, looked at my hands felt like they were restricted from lifting up and saw myself in cuffs. Confused why my hands were dirtied with soil and alarmingly pale in color... Looked up and saw a girl in white dress crouched in fetal position and in pain. The only thing running in my mind is that she is in pain I must help her out! \n\nI was behaving like I knew her. But in reality I don't know who she is... But had a strong feeling like it was my best friend. (Whom I met online) \nAnd I was upset when people where hurting her by punishing her like they were making fun and harassing her. Weird thing is I couldn't hear them but knew exactly what they were doing. Hurting her. \n\nI looked frantically around me and saw a part of room enveloped in darkness just pitch dark. And somehow saw a book floating... (Don't ask me how I saw a black heavy book in pitch dark room. I myself am confused and scratching my head at this). At first I refused to even look at the book (I felt weird that the book belonged to me) but then another look at the girl made my heart shatter. And I immediately thought of the book. But since I was in cuffs my anger rose and rose and I could feel my dangerous aura increase and it wasn't a good aura. It just increased without stopping and next thing I knew was sudden calmness and lightweight and everything went blank. And I suddenly shook myself from my vision.... \n\n\n(Background why I spoke about this incident-\nI saw the Medusa like tree in the previous dreams and it was a bit recurring ones.. and in a totally unrelated dream and different times I dream of a castle with an opening but never entered. \n\nAnother dream was me in an Archer outfit and waiting for someone or something. Knew the forest well enough not to step out of it's boundaries.. i don't know what boundaries I am talking about... But I just felt that. \n\nAnother dream that stood out and didn't realise at that time that after some years I started to see a girl in white and she looked different in both in front of the castle and in front of the tree. And I had a strong feeling that they both are the same girl)\n\n\nI have had visions of death before. I mean prediction of death. But never the witch kind... What does it mean?",

        "text": "I’m writing this in hopes of generating a small discussion and getting some thoughts on something difficult to explain…\n\nFor a long time I have noticed certain people give off a very “cold” vibe. It often has absolutely nothing to do with the person but it’s as if an invisible bubble of cold air follows people around and if I am in close enough proximity, I feel it. Does anybody else experience this or would like to share their thoughts on the subject? \n\nMy brief experience: For the past three years I have been “donating” plasma twice a week. At the center where I make my donation I have gotten to know nearly every employee there. The center itself is very clean and well kept, in the winter it is kept nice and warm and in the summer it could be a nice place to retreat to for the refreshing air conditioning in the hot summer months. But ever since I could remember, certain staff members carry around this invisible pocket of cold air I can feel when they walk within 3-5 feet of me. \n\nI’ve ruled out that it is determined by their pace or quickness because one guy there is the quickest walking man I have ever seen and he zips past me anytime I see him and I’ve never felt the sensation around him, but other members walk like a snail compared to him past my donation bed and I sometimes get such a cold sensation I shiver. It always lasts about 10 seconds or less but I’ve noticed it happens consistently from specific people. Paying attention, I’ll observe a different staff member walk past me and I notice no coldness at all but the same person returns on their path and I feel just as cold when they get near me. \n\nAnyway, some people have very cold energy they radiate which comes from people that could otherwise be visually perceived as nice and warm. Would love to hear some other personal observations on this phenomenon.",

Not sure if it is sleep paralysis or something like that... \n\nIncident 1: I had a fully blown panic attack but felt paralyzed on my bed. Didn't know what I was being afraid of. And I had an image of an old man in black gown till the ankles staring intensely at me as if causing migraines. And at the same time something alive but felt like a moving being and wasn't human but just sitting on my chest causing shortness of breath. Around 5am I mustered courage to see the \"old man\" standing in front of me. And when I opened my eyes I felt immense relief from chest. But headache still felt like being pounded but not that bad. Same day in the evening my mom told me that one grandpa died of heart attack and the other went into coma. They were brothers and I barely knew them. (Distant grandpas) and what shook me to the core is the coincidence. The grandpa who died...died at around 5am... I never ask for time of death or anything. But it was completely weird of me to ask their time of death as if I am used to hearing that very often. I felt like a completely different person when I asked her this question. \n\nIncident 2: it was a festival and was standing in front of God during the prayers. (It is a jovial celebration and a very auspicious one) but I suddenly felt dazed confused and as if everything slowed down suddenly. I could pick up everything as if I was thrown in slow motion. Sounds of prayers dulled in my ears. (Now at this point I could actually sense presence in room since childhood. This one freaked me out) i couldn't feel a presence but my body naturally turned to the right and I saw an image of a lady and uttered her name in my head. Next thing an odd voice (not from this world) in human voice said that \"she no longer exists\" and suddenly I was brought back to my senses. I stared at the lady on my right and couldn't register her face properly. And the weirdest part is how the hell would I know that am invisible presence is fr this world or not? I just know that just don't know how I do that. Sometimes I feel like I ain't human at this stage. \n\nOne month after the lady's name whom I said in my dazed state actually died. \n\nI am so freaked out because both incidents are dream and prediction still freaks me out. Help me understand this. Pls. These aren't actually the only predictions. Cause mine is so rand that no two cases of prediction is the same. But it had a pattern. A deep sensation that whatever was gonna happen was gonna come true. It's just that strongest feeling in all predictions.",

My fiancé found out it used to be a civil war armory or something like that, he was loving the history aspect of the hotel too! We had a nice southern dinner in one of the most beautiful cities in the country in our opinion and when we went back to the hotel everything seemed fine. We got ready for bed, watched some Netflix, planned our next day and turned the lights outs to go to bed. My fiancé passed out instantly and I dozed off but I felt the weirdest pressure consuming my body. Like I had a ton of bricks on me. I’ve heard of sleep paralysis before but have never had it in my life. I opened my eyes and I saw the darkest looking figure in the corner of our room. I was completely frozen and couldn’t speak. I don’t know if I was frozen in fear or if it was something else. I kept staring at the figure to see if it would move and it looked like after a few minutes it just faded away into the corner it was in. I was still frozen and once I was able to move I snuggled up with my fiancé and got my phone and looked up the hotel and saw it was named one of the most haunted hotels in the entire south! After snuggling with my fiancé and being mostly under the covers I fell asleep. I told my fiancé what happened and he said he had really really dark dreams which is rare for him so something was really fishy. We asked the hotel staff at breakfast if the hotel was haunted and they laughed and just said “I’m not going to touch that topic.” We had another 5 days of our stay and I was so scared to sleep but it never happened again. Does this seem like a haunting or just sleep paralysis and a weird coincidence that he had scary dreams that same night too? Could it have been anything? I know that city, although beautiful has a very VERY dark history.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this was at like 2-3am and the room felt very cold and when I was able to get to my phone to do some research the hotel Wi-Fi (which was typically very fast) was painfully slow to the point where I needed to use regular data to use the internet. And even that was unusually slow for a bit.",

        "text": "Similar to another post that was just made. When my sister and I were young. We came into contact with a group of women from the U.K that referred to themselves (at least online) as the Sibsi Graa. It was heavily tied into an ARG (Alternate reality game) that took place on a number of scattered forums and wikis. \n\nHad it been left at that, then it would have been just some meaningless internet escapism. But we noticed some weird patterns. The people in question were very interested in getting the younger participants in the game to move to the U.K. They were into the occult and black magic, specifically variations of theistic and violent types of Satanic practice akin to the Order of Nine Angles, another U.K based and particularly nasty occult group. At the time they provided photographic evidence of some pretty shady activity that they would get up to in the U.K. \n\nMy sister and I agree now as adults that a lot of the behavior we witnessed is similar in character to cult grooming, and the result of this in our lives both normal and paranormal has been obvious to us since that time. We're looking for information related to this topic or these people. To figure out if it's something other people know about, or if we were just gaslit hard by a group of people pretending to be a well connected Satanic cult. Any information is appreciated.",

If your wondering what the photo looks like I’ll show you, BTW this isn’t edited or faked at all, but take a look for yourself. And it’s one of those “when you see it, you’ll shit bricks” moments.

I was about to use the set of elevators that are sandwiched in-between the old building and new addition.\n\nGet on, push the button to go up a floor or two everything is fine, until the elevator started going down instead of up. I just figured someone called the elevator before I hit the button for my floor which happened sometimes bc they pretty much operated by who pushed the button first yaknow. \n\nWell elevator takes me down to the basement level which is the oldest part of the hospital (also housed the morgue around the corner from this area). Doors open nobody is there to have called the elevator.\n\nFigured whatever maybe they were impatient and went another way or something. Tried pushing the close doors button, nothing happened elevator just sat there with the doors open on the basement level. The floor i selected was still lit but i tried pushing a different floor above us, it lit up just like my intended floor still was but nothing. Waited and button mashed for at least five minutes but doors stayed wide open and elevator didn't move. Which was unheard of for those doors to stay open (didn't even have a service switch where you can push to lock the doors open when needed btw) let alone for the elevator not to be called, it was a commonly used elevator, always moving.\n\nDecided okay must have just broke down, i don't have time for this. Well as soon as I step out of the elevator the doors shut and the elevator leaves to go to the floors i selected.\n\nSomething really wanted me to visit them in the basement and wouldn't take no for an answer.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/10zcixt/weird_family_story_did_my_grandfather_kill_a_demon/",
        "text": "So this is actually a story from my grandfather that the elders of my family have apparently assisted to, but I wasn't even born at the time so I cannot deny or confirm, lol. But here it is. Do keep an open mind til' the end please, I know it sounds crazy. \n\nSo to give you some context, my great grandfather had to settle in the mountain region of Northern Morocco for many years after having to leave his country of origin. The region was remote. Forests, a few desolate houses scattered here and there, no lights, and barely any routes or means of transport aside from mules. So he settled with his wife and sons in a village of the region and built a humble farm through the years. The people of the village were incredibly superstitious; they had an almost paranoid fear of \"Jinn\" and demons, insisting that you must respect them, and dubbing them \"the owners of the place\".\n\n So for those who haven't heard of these, Jinn are invisible entities mentioned in the Quran, that can be good, or bad (making them demons). My grandfather says that the villagers' fear, however, went beyond religious belief and was definitely more superstitious than anything, if that makes any sense to you. They would wear trinkets and nail accessories (for lack of better words) believed to ward off the evil Jinn, the 'evil eye', and the evil of sorcerers, etc. \n\nThe years pass and my great-grandmother dies of illness. She was buried in a cemetery in the middle of nowhere, and my grandfather (her son) was so heartbroken he couldn't leave.  In his grief, he spent half of the night there at the side of her tomb.\nIt was late after midnight when he decided to go home, which is quite the walk. Remember there are no paved roads or lights, so he was just walking in a forest. \nOn the road, he came across a big black dog among the trees. As my grandfather tells, it was both sudden fear and anger that drove him to throw a rock at the animal. He said the animal was so big that he feared its attack, and it didn't look very friendly either. He says he aimed at \"the rib\".  The rock struck hard and the animal fell instantly. My grandfather had, apparently, killed it.\n\nHe went on his way, not really caring about that. That's when the story, according to my family, begins.\n\nA few days pass and my grandfather falls ill. At first it seemed like a passing fever, and considering that he spent a night in the cold, it was a natural consequence. But then my grandfather began to see things, and soon enough he was deep into his hallucinations, as if going through a psychotic episode. His brother, who was a priest, took him to a hospital in the city of Tangiers. He stayed there for a while, I don't fully know the details of this, but even after my grandfather has been hospitalized his condition was only getting worse. \nNow, to my grandfather's brother. He was a priest, though I'm not sure if that's only it. my great-uncle (idk if that's how I'm supposed to refer to him, we only just called him uncle when we were kids) was quite knowledgeable about the occult. He began to suspect that my grandfather was possessed.\n\nSo my great uncle decided to perform an exorcism on my grandfather. According to him it was really hard, and it took countless exorcisms to get the 'evil entity' to talk. And when it did it said something along the lines of my grandfather hurting or killing its kin (again I only heard this story from my family when I was younger, and though it was repeatedly mentioned I don't really remember all the details), the evil entity also said they had every right to bring vengeance upon my grandfather. I know this is the most interesting part but I wasn't really told much about the exorcisms and I remember even less, but, according to my grandfather, it took over a year to get the evil entity to leave. \n\nMy grandfather regained his full strength afterwards, and he is now living completely normally. No hallucinations, no nothing. \n\nSo what do you think about this? Do you think the story is credible or is my family exagerating things? I wouldn't like to think they all agreed on one big fat lie since it's my family so I'm certainly more biased to believe it, but I'd also be a liar if I say that i don't find the story uncanny and unbelievable in many aspects. There are many other weird stories among my family about that village, but I'm not sure what to feel about them. What do you think?",

I am a Buddhist and growing up, my family and I believe in paranormal beings and spiritual events. I had a pet parrot at the time who sleeps on the bed with me and have had him for 2 years or so. My apartment is cleansed by monks every year (cultural tradition) and I have never experienced or sensed anything paranormal inside the house. As far as I remember, that particular month, I would get consistent nightmares; I would dream about being in a battlefield and I would be shot dead and would wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. The thing I noticed was that every time I wake up my parrot would be up/alert and would always be looking in one direction which is that corner of my room. I talked to my parents about it but they just discarded it but at that one night it was intense ; it felt so real and this guy dressed in an army uniform kept repeating the same phrase “it’s time to come back home” after that, when I woke up in cold sweats again, I noticed that my parrot had jumped out of the bed and was literally in front squaking aggressively as if it was trying to attack something at that same corner. By that time I screamed for my parents and when they came in my parrot just stopped and was staring in sense where watching someone walk around. I told my parents everything that night and my dad was pretty chill and just told me someone from my past life might have visited me. After that night, those nightmares never came back and everything is as normal as it can be. I am not sure what happened though, still wondering about it till today.",

I can't though, so there's no way for me to know if what they've been saying is really true.\nMy mom claims to have been in contact with \"ghosts\", or people she could see but no one else could since she was little. My sibling is the same way sort of. And my grandma. All three of them talk about it so casually, that it's kind of hard to doubt them. But I'm still questioning it. An example of a situation that I question big time is when my sibling and I were sleeping in our room, in the DARK (except for a nightlight, but things were still hard to see) and they got scared because they \"saw a hand\" in the bed right next to us. I saw nothing though, even though it was right by my face.\n\nAnother situation I question big time is a story my mom told me. When she was younger, maybe like 5, she claims that she saw a little kid in the house no one else could see. The kid would ask her to play, but she was terrified so her mom got a witch doctor or something to do some ritual or something to get rid of the kid she saw (this is a small town in the Philippines, so they had a local witch doctor). What really makes me doubt her story, and that she could've just been imagining things as a kid, is that she claimed that one night, possibly the last that she saw the kid was when the kid came \"marching around her with a trail of teddy bears\". Like that sounds like she was on something ngl.\n\nThey don't all have schizophrenia or something right?\n\nTLDR; my family casually talks about seeing things others can't see, and I'm wondering if they have schizophrenia or something (I myself have seen nothing) and it's kind of hard to believe them.",

There's a security camera in our garage, so I contacted my landlord and requested the recording from that night, we'll see if they get back to me, and if they do I will update this post with the video.\n\nNot sure what it was, so if anyone could help identify it, here's as much of a description as I can give. It  had large ears, and no tail that I could spot, and seemed vaguely brown or maybe brownish green. It might have had fur, but I couldn't discern a whole lot in the moment. Thanks for listening. I'll be keeping an eye on my email to see if they caught anything on video.",

        "text": "Last year both my grandparents died in the span of 5 months from each other. We have still kept there house as we have not started to clear it out yet and would recently go to turn on the heating or stay for a few hours to keep it a good condition. This is due to the fact  it’s an old family home which has been passed down through generations. So before my nanny and grandad had it, my nanny’s parents did.\n\nToday my boyfriend and I went around alone as I needed to clean out my car and my mum has suggested to use the hoover my grandad had in his garage as I could park my car in it and clean it out easily there. When we got there the house was icy cold like worst than outside. I turned the heating on then went to open the garage using the keys but the door would not open at all. Now I doubled checked and it was the correct keys. I even phoned my mum to check as well. My boyfriend then had a go but the lock would constantly click but then re click as in someone from the inside was re-locking it again. We didn’t think anything of it until more things started to occur.\n\nMy boyfriend is very superstitious about these things and had made a joke that it was my grandad refusing to let us into the garage. A few moments later my boyfriend got a burning sensation on his back and asked me to check what was up as it was really hurting him. I checked and seen multiple scratch marks down his back. There was two pairs of two scratch names then a random one in the middle. After I took pictures we left as we started to feel uneasy. \n\nDoes anyone known what this mean? My boyfriend and I are very big believers in paranormal and was wondering if there was any meaning behind being scratched.I would attach the pictures we have but it won’t allow me. Any comment or suggestion is welcome as we are very interested into what this may mean.",

I mentioned that because the woman I saw was someone I had never seen. I first encountered her in the back in the frozen section as I went to grab a bag of ice last minute and as soon as I saw her I began to feel ill to my stomach like if you ate bad food. I then started to feel very shaky and horribly panic and the only thing I could really focus on is getting away from her. I didn't want to be anywhere in her vicinity. She got in line behind me in the market and gave me a really weird look. I then felt like I was punched in the gut and it felt like I was going to crap myself right there. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before? Also, I could not tell you about her features even though I looked at her a couple of times. I remember her having dark brown hair, but my partner swears she had mostly greying hair.\n\nAfter I got home, I felt like I had just escaped something. I got instantly drained feeling and a feeling like I was running out of adrenaline. I seriously never want to feel that way just getting near someone again.",

        "text": "Hi reddit, to protect my client, I will be calling her Mrs. Spooky because I am too laxzy to come up with a better name. Sorry.  \n\n\nI (21f) started this job, being an at home health care worker, back in September. The job at first was your pretty average job. All I basically had to do was to make sure my client was well taken care for and make sure she had someone to talk to. Everything was very normal up until I started picking up more shifts at night (I am a college student).  \n\n\nOne morning, I was getting my client's medication ready, when her grandson (who lives with her) is about to walk out to go to work. Because he kept knocking over this can of febreze, he then put the can of febreze in between the couch cushions so it couldn't move. 10 minutes after he leaves, the can of febreze jumps out of the couch cushions, does a flip, and lands straight upwards.\n\nI freak out for a second, but then I play it off and tell myself there is a reasonable explantion  \n\n\nBut it keeps contiuing, frames falling off walls, people talking in the kitchen and hallway when no one is home but me and my client, things being thrown at me, the figure of a face smeared against the kitchen window, shadow people  \n\n\nBut last night was the worst of it. I got there early yesterday because my client had a food package waiting to be put in the fridge. My client greets me with a smile and I make her some mac and cheese after I put the food up. My client dropped her fork and asked me to wash it, so I did.  \n\n\nWhile cleaning off the fork, I hear a can fall behind me so I go to pick it up. The scrub brush from the sink goes flying at me. Im spooked, but it's not the first time this has happened so I go back to hanging out with Mrs Spooky.  \n\n\nThings are pretty back to normal until I hear more things start to fall in the kitchen, maybe a cat snuck in again, I go to turn on the kitchen light, but the lighbulb burst and the house goes from a good 94 (my client gets cold easy) to a cool 60-ish degrees. At this point I am hoping there was just a weird power surge that had just turned off everything.  \n\n\nI rush back to my client. Everything is fine. No poweroutages and it's still pretty hot in the living room. Then a shadow moves in the kitchen and my client jumps back. Luckily her grandson pulled up right after this and he was pretty spooked when I told him what had happened.  \n\n\nMaybe it's a ghost/demon. Maybe someone has been in the house without anyone knowing. All I know is that im terrified of going back to work.",

        "text": "Sorry if this reads like fiction, it’s just my writing style!\n\nI've been scared of my grandmother's house for as long as I can remember. She lives far away so when I visit it's always overnight for a weekend or longer. In the day time it's fine, but I have never been comfortable being alone in the house even then. At night things can be really different. Full disclosure: her house is big and old so it's always cold and a bit eerie anyway.\n\nI have always been terrified of sleeping there, but especially as a child (me and my sister shared a bed because of this). I'd frequently wake up in the night and feel something there (in 1 of 3 places in the room - ~2m away from me, the foot of the bed, or ~2m into the room from the door). I would have this horrific feeling of dread, feel cold and be covered in sweat. I'd lie awake for hours in this state just hoping it would go away. A few times I told it to leave and it did. Any time I looked at it all i could see was a black fuzzy kinda rectangle or oval shape/mound. Once I looked at the foot of the bed and could clearly see a 6ft tall ~4ft wide mound of solid black. The curtains behind it had moonlight shining through them so I could clearly see the shape. I have felt something tugging on the duvet too but never with real force. I have slept in other rooms and had the same experiences, just in different spots around the room. The cold and sweat isn't always there but the dread and fear goes hand in hand with the feeling of something being there.\n\nTo my knowledge, my sister, mum and (possibly) some uncles have had similar experiences, but it's not something we've really talked about much since recently. My dad - who doesn't believe in the paranormal - also once said he felt the lighting fixture above him swinging in the dark. We have heard something/someone running up and down the stairs a few times too.\n\nI'm not sure what my grandmother is aware of and what she isn't, but she just used to assume it was my grandfather (as she's felt it in bed with her) and felt at ease with it. I'm not sure if he died in the house or in the hospital, but he was living in the house before he died. As far as I'm aware my mum's always had issues sleeping there. \n\nI've had a few strange experiences in my family home too, but nothing like this.\n\nMy grandmother has recently moved to a care home, but we still stay in the house when we visit. It's taken a few months but the house now feels fine. I still feel a bit weird when I go to sleep (and still will not sleep alone!!) but I sleep through the night every night and no longer experience the same fear/dread or strange experiences.\n\nDoes this suggest it's following my grandmother? She did a ouja board when she was young and spoke to her dead uncle, but not sure if this warrants this kind of activity. This is the only place I've ever known her to live, but my mum has mentioned having similar feelings of dread in previous houses. We once went on holiday to a cottage and heard monks singing at night from downstairs (where my grandmother was sleeping).\n\nSorry this is long and for the random details. Not sure what I'm after here but any suggestions as to what these experiences could be are welcome!",

        "text": "I've been experiencing this for a while but yesterday night was my breaking point. I can't exactly pin point what I did to experience this but a few years ago, younger and naive me did some random TikTok challenges that's probably paranormal. I did quite a few consecutively too so I have no idea which one was the exact one that caused this. \n\nWhat happened specifically last night was I felt my head levitating, I kind of woke up in a blurry state and I felt a really really bad presence. Then I felt my hair band getting pulled off my hair slowly. My scalp literally tensed up so much. I tried to act as if I was still sleeping and I did went to sleep soon.\n\nOver the last year or so, my house always had random door bangs or doors opening. The doors and windows will be closed properly and both will flung open at the same time when I'm home alone. Also whichever room I sleep in at night will have this whirring sound which my family members don't experience too. Also before I drift into deep sleeps I always have auditory hallucinations. I will hear loads of footsteps shuffling around me even though I'm alone and whispering. This only happens at night. Afternoon naps are fine. I've felt uncomfortable presence several time and had several sleep paralysis. Nightmares has also been very frequent. Almost every night and I would either wake up 1 hour after I fell asleep or around 2-3am.\n\nBTW I don't like scaring myself and I don't believe in ghosts so I thought I was imagining it. Last night felt too real, I'm sure I wasn't imagining it. My family is buddhist though I'm personally a free thinker if that helps or anything. Also none of them are experiencing any of this. AND also I live in a very safe and small apartment with my family. There's certainly no criminal activity so this is either 100% mental or 100% paranormal. I'm also not on any medication.\n\nI did ask my parents for house cleansing(she said no) and I went for a psychology test. They did find indication of adhd but nothing more. Please. someone tell me whether I'm going crazy or I can do something about this.",
