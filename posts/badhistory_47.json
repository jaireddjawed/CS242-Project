        "text": "[Sigh](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vz0ni/michelangelo_had_the_biggest_balls_of_any/)\n\nWe've all seen this conspiracy theory before. *Michelangelo painted a brain on the sistine chapel, guise!* Most of you probably are familiar with this piece of work, it being one of two most famous and well known of Christian artwork throughout the world, the other being Leonardo Da Vinci's [The Last Supper](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Ultima_cena_-_ca_1975.jpg). For those of you who aren't as familiar with this particular piece of work, let me quickly explain. \n\nThe Sistine Chapel is a chapel building in the heart of the Apostolic Palace, where the Pope, Cardinal of Rome and general leader of the Roman Catholic Church, resides. Between 1508 and 1512, Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo Buonarroti, an already wildly famous sculptor at the time and who would go on to be arguably the greatest artist of the Renaissance Era and by proxy of that title, one of, if not the greatest artist in history, to paint the ceiling and west wall frescos.  \nWhat you see in the picture is a small section of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling-- one of nine individual frames detailing the entire book of Genesis from God separating Light and Darkness, to the Drunkness of Noah-- and this most famous frame by far, known as *The Creation of Adam*. \n\nNow, onto the badhistory.\n\nWhat these geniuses are trying to do is say that Michelangelo painted God's cloak in the shape of a cross section of a human brain. This theory can be originally found presented by, hey can you guess by who? If you guessed a fucking gynecologist at Saint John's Medical Center in October of 1990, you win, while we lose! A certain Dr. Meshburger was so entranced with his new-found revelation of Michelangelo's brain fetish that he felt entitled to share this with the New York Times, who apparently had a slow week or something, because they published it. Meanwhile, real art historians all over the country are drinking themselves to sleep over their realization that their field of study has become so discredited that a man who stares at vaginas for a living apparently has the same level of credibility as they do on the subject. \n\nNow, his reasoning is largely scientific and tied up in the intricacies of the anatomy of the brain, which is irrelevant to this subreddit if not for the rather obvious point that people in the 14th century sure as hell did not have this modern idea in their heads of how our brain should look.\n\nAnyways, this theory resurfaced a two decades later in the depths of r/Atheism, where those who feel threatened by religious people of any degree of competency during any time or place have decided that they would 'steal' Michelangelo away from the dirty faithmongers. This leads people to further speculate that Michelangelo meant to say that \"God is in the mind\" therefore, God is made up. Thankfully, most of the top comments note that the idea that Michelangelo's atheism was expressed in a brain on a tiny section of an enormous painted ceiling that a gynecologist and a few nueroscientists thought they saw is a but a step away from 9/11 conspriracy theory levels of ludricrousness. Nevertheless, a few brave souls in r/Atheism fight back against the measured, moderate tyranny by citing Michelangelo as a person, and his intentions no less, during the 1500s, and [this is where the badhistory starts really kicking into high gear:](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vz0ni/michelangelo_had_the_biggest_balls_of_any/c58wbna)\n\n&gt;Heh, the entire ceiling of the sistine chapel is one big \"fuck you\" to the holy roman church. The hidden brain is just one of the most impressive parts of it.\nHere's some fun facts about this ceiling.\nMichelangelo hated the job. He might have been a talented painter but he didn't care much for painting. The pope demanding that he plaster a broken ceiling and then paint it galled him.\nThe pope actually asked for something very simple. He wanted Michelangelo to fix the ceiling like a common laborer and then paint a scene with Jezus on it. Mikey bitched and complained until the pope gave in and let him have free reign in his design.\nThis is where it get's really good. Years later the finished work is unveiled and what is actually in the ceiling? A massive scene full of Jewish heroes and major characters from the Jewish bible. There wasn't a single christian saint or noteworthy character in the entire thing. Any space not filled with Jewish biblical heroes was filled with naked boys and pagan sybils.\nNot only only did he fill his commission by the pope full of Jews while leaving the Christians out, there's also a lot of symbolism in the painting extremely critical of the shameful treatment jews received.\nOne of the most famous examples of this is Aminadab. He is depicted behind the throne of the pope wearing a yellow badge of shame. He is looking directly at the viewer, almost unheard of in Mike's work and usually only reserved for very important characters. Finally, Aminadab is subtly making the gesture of the devil's horns directly at the spot where the pope would have sat.\nThere's a lot more rude gestures and borderline blasphemous acts hidden in the painting\nBefore you say \"tin foil hat\" realize that Michelangelo was one of the greatest scholars in history. He had extensive knowledge of both Judaism and Christianity. Something which most Christian clergy had not, which made it easy for him to paint unnoticed insulting metaphors.\nIn addition he also illegally studied human anatomy and was one of the few people in his time who actually knew what a human brain looks like. In the end he was a genius and a master in many fields who frequently employed extensive symbolism and hidden meaning in his work. It is fairly safe to assume that there are no \"happy accidents\" in something that took him years to craft and deals with subject matter he had studied extensively.\nIf people had understood the ceiling during Michelangelo's lifetime, he'd have probably been executed for it.\n\nOk. Okkkkkk. Let's start to dissect this lunacy bit by bit:\n\n&gt;Heh, the entire ceiling of the sistine chapel is one big \"fuck you\" to the holy roman church.\n\nReally. The entire ceiling. Well you've got you're genius god-is-in-the-brain theory right there, taking the up entire panel of *The Creation of Adam* which is 1/50th of the entire ceiling not counting the lunattes. [See? The Creation of Adam isn't even the focus of the entire painting. It's not even in the center!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_Sistine_Chapel_ceiling#mediaviewer/File:CAPPELLA_SISTINA_Ceiling.jpg) \nYou can make an argument that maaaybe the inclusion of pagan sybils was a snub, but it's a huge fucking stretch to call that a middle finger to the RCC, given how popular this infusion of Classical imagery into religious art was at the time. Was Michelangelo was massive troll and snuck in some snubs? Absolutely, but calling the entire piece of work a middle finger to the church because of one or two of those troll easter eggs is like billing Stan Lee as a major star in the Amazing Spiderman because he shows up for all of 5 seconds to almost get a table almost flung into the back of his head. \n\n&gt;Michelangelo hated the job. He might have been a talented painter but he didn't care much for painting. The pope demanding that he plaster a broken ceiling and then paint it galled him. The pope actually asked for something very simple. He wanted Michelangelo to fix the ceiling like a common laborer and then paint a scene with Jezus on it. Mikey bitched and complained until the pope gave in and let him have free reign in his design.\n\nAre you kidding me? [First off, this is not a broken ceiling to be plastered, you philistine.](http://sistinepuzzle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/1chapel3.jpg) Secondly, Michelangelo was incredibly famous at the time, and he most certainly have not been asked to fix the ceiling like a common laborer. The man was the first Western ever to have a biography published of him *while he was still alive-- twice*. That would have been like asking Lebron James at the age of 20 to try out for the local community college team, or asking Kayne West after his release of *Jesus Walks* to sing at your birthday off a karoke machine. It just wasn't done. \n\nAlthough, yes, he did not like painting at all. He felt he was a sculptor at heart; he considered sculpting to be the superior art, although he also balked at the job because he felt he did not have the skills to do justice to the task set before him. Needless to say he did adequtely, but only after he taught himself how to paint in about 2 years.\n\n&gt;This is where it get's really good. Years later the finished work is unveiled and what is actually in the ceiling? A massive scene full of Jewish heroes and major characters from the Jewish bible. There wasn't a single christian saint or noteworthy character in the entire thing. Any space not filled with Jewish biblical heroes was filled with naked boys and pagan sybils.\n\nDid you forget that the Jewish bible is called the \"Old Testament\" to Christians or did you have an anuerysm while you where writing that and that shred of stupidity managed to slip through to your fingers? Did it get through to your head that the entire ceiling was based off of the Old Testament, and that all of those \"Jewish Prophets and Pagan Sybils\" were intended to herald and foretell of the coming of our Good Lord-- YOU KNOW, BEFORE CHRISTIANITY / CHRISTIAN SAINTS WOULD EXIST-- or sorry, was Saint George supposed to join Saint Patrick the Timelord in his TARDIS and journey 1500 years in the past so they could write themsleves into the Talmud so they could join the Jesus Prophecy Party too? \n\nAlso, if their aren't enough Christian Saints for you on the ceiling, how about on the west wall fresco, you duck-fuck, on [The Last Judgement](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Michelangelo,_Giudizio_Universale_02.jpg) where God-Jesus, ripped like goddamned Heracles, surrounded by dozens of saints around him, judges the saved and the damned? Is that enough Christian saints for you, or do walls not count?\n\n&gt;Not only only did he fill his commission by the pope full of Jews while leaving the Christians out, there's also a lot of symbolism in the painting extremely critical of the shameful treatment jews received.\n\nI can actually feel myself getting stupider reading this. Should I to go over again about the absences of Christians in a fresco detailing the prophecy of the coming of *Christ* or maybe I don't need to remind people that chronologically, prophecies tend to happen before the events they foretell do? \n\n&gt;One of the most famous examples of this is Aminadab. He is depicted behind the throne of the pope wearing a yellow badge of shame. He is looking directly at the viewer, almost unheard of in Mike's work and usually only reserved for very important characters. Finally, Aminadab is subtly making the gesture of the devil's horns directly at the spot where the pope would have sat.\n\nThis is, perhaps, the most valid of the points this person makes, although it's a goddamned shame he couldn't have even been bothered to even copy-paste the same arguments off of the numerous Jewish Conspiracy sites that publish this over and over again. He can have this one although I don't give him any more credit than copy-pasting off of whichever favorite atheist blog he got it from. \n\n\n&gt;Before you say \"tin foil hat\" realize that Michelangelo was one of the greatest scholars in history. He had extensive knowledge of both Judaism and Christianity. Something which most Christian clergy had not, which made it easy for him to paint unnoticed insulting metaphors.\n\nTin foil hat, you quack.\n\nAnd Michelangelo--- *graaah!* Calling him a scholar, let alone one of the greatest scholars in history, *shows just how little you know of the man*. Unlike his predecessor Leonardo who truly was one of the greatest scholars in history as well as one of the greatest artists, Michelangelo through and through was at heart, an artist, and only that. He had little patience for anything but his craft, and any scientific endeavors he made for himself was almost certainly in devotion to improving his craft, which by the way, were relatively few. He studied corpses in order to further his understanding his ability to sculpt, and his engineering forays were almost certainly taken up to alow him to expand his craft into Architecture. He is NOT the archtypal Renaissance man in the sense that he was a warrior/scholar/poet/artist, which I have the sneaking suspicion that too many people in that subreddit think of themselves, but that Michelangelo was almost like a savant-- he was a real life, high-functioning sociopath who instead of solving mysteries with a devoted but exasperated friend, devoted himself and his energies to his art, largely to sculpting, and sculpting, and hey, more sculpting. \n\nAnd fucking hell. \"He had a deep understanding of Judaism and Christianity, something which most Christian Clergy did not\"?! Which then allowed him to sneak in all of these supposed snubs?! The RCC back in the 1500s was not a proto-Westboro Bapist Church you stpuid shit.\n\n&gt;**In addition he also illegally studied human anatomy** and was one of the few people in his time who actually knew what a human brain looks like. In the end he was a genius and a master in many fields who frequently employed extensive symbolism and hidden meaning in his work. It is fairly safe to assume that there are no \"happy accidents\" in something that took him years to craft and deals with subject matter he had studied extensively.\n\n\n[No](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/04/debunking-a-myth/)\n\n\n&gt;In the end he was a genius and a master in many fields\n\nNooooooo. I mean, yes he was a genius. Yes he was a master in \"many fields\", only if by many fields, you mean only art, and if by art, you mean sculpting. By our standards he was really, really, almost autistically savant-ly good at art-- of art, he considered himself to be solely at heart, a sculptor, and did not consider his skills in the other media to be nearly as good. What you are doing is conflating him with Leonardo Da Vinci, the real master of many fields, which makes me think you've taken Art 101 to fufill your stupid GE requirement to move to your upper division STEM class and you're doing nothing but requrgitate shit you think you've learned from five years ago.\n\n&gt;Try google and google image search. I'm not spending half an hour backing up stuff I learned in art history.\n\nWho was your teacher? Because if you legitimately learned all of this straight out of the mouth of your college professor I want to hurt them.\n\n&gt;It is fairly safe to assume that there are no \"happy accidents\" in something that took him years to craft and deals with subject matter he had studied extensively.\n\nOf all things in this world, I think seeing a fucking brain, a modern, scientifically popular forward cross-section of a brain no less, on one tiny panel on the ceiling of the greatest work of religious art ever made can be called a happy accident at the very least. \n\n\n&gt;If people had understood the ceiling during Michelangelo's lifetime, he'd have probably been executed for it.\n\nIt may surprise you that killing people was generally frowned upon during that time. The Church rarely executed people for anything of that sort of charge-- and the most common type cause of execution, of heresy, would usually only be carried through after given multiple times to recant. It's not cool, for sure, but imagining Michelangelo as some bravetheist who waethered the dangers of execution just to troll the entire church with his pro-Jewish messages on the ceiling of their largest chapel is just so, so wrong on so, so many levels. Not even to mention that even if the church took offense to his actions, which Michelangelo, being something of a passionate misanthrope, did often to many of the people he met, he was far too famous and far too beloved for anyone to take action against him. He almost certainly would have had numerous wealthy patrons to back him should he be targeted, many of them probably on the level of, if not were the Head of State.\n\n**TL;DR people are stupid for seriously believing that out of all the troll things Michelangelo would have done, painting God's cloak as a brain is not one of them.**\n\n\n\n\n**BONUS: bad art analysis** \n&gt;the cool thing about art is that its up to your interpretation. Some could see this as god communicating through your brain or god giving man his intelligence/reasonins, others could see it as god is really a product of our own minds.\n\nI know your middle school art spectrum class might have taught you that every piece of art is up to your interpretation and that every opinion is your own special snowflake, but when you're considering Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, the man whose passion and intensity to his craft led his contemporaries to attribute to him an awe-inspiring sense of granduer that they dubbed *la terribilita*, when you are so hardcore and meticulous about your art that people actually start to give your aura*--names!*, your opinion about *his* work is invalid. So is mine, although your opinion that *The Creation of Adam* might be interpreted as an atheistic work of art might just be stupider. Michelangelo would not have put up with your new age bullshit on alternatively interpeting art. \"I live and love in God's Peculiar Light\" you might have heard Michelangelo quoted whenever you build the Sistine Chapel in Civ 5. Maybe you should start taking him seriously and stop trying to attribute 20th century abstract philosophy to 16th century religious artwork. \n\nFucking undergrads and their stupid opinions on historical art. I'm one too, but I'm angrier and drunker so that makes me right.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/28m3pw/andrew_jackson_ignored_a_ruling_by_the_supreme/",
        "text": "Andrew Jackson oozes badhistory, so I thought it was high time I clarify this claim. I see this charge thrown around quite a lot, even at times by otherwise well educated people. Let's ignore for starters that in the early 19th century the notion of the Supreme Court having exclusive rights to interpret the constitution and having constitutional supremacy was not one that was universally accepted. This means that even had Jackson ignored the court's ruling it only seems particularly heinous through relatively modern eyes.\n\nThe case arose out of an 1830 Georgia law prohibiting any white men from living in Cherokee territory without permission from the state. The law was aimed at the numerous missionaries working among the Indians and advising them in their resistance to the state of Georgia. A few missionaries refused to leave or obtain licenses and were arrested, convicted in state court, and sentenced to four years of hard labor. Most of the missionaries accepted Pardons and left the state but two, Samuel A. Worcester and Elizer Butler refused and appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Worcester and Butler were represented by an able legal team in William Wirt and John Sergeant ( who were interestingly running for POTUS and VP on different tickets while conducting the trial). Georgia refused to recognize the sovereignty of the court and sent no representation. Marshall found in favor of the Cherokee on almost every count: they were a sovereign nation free from Georiga's control, the state law's were overturned, and Worcester and Butler were entitled to their freedom. Here is where things get tricky:\n\nKeeping in mind that this is the early 19th century before even telegraphs it takes sometime for word of the court's decision to reach Georgia. Before the court can issue a writ of Habeas Corpus they had to have proof that the state court rejected the authority of the supreme court. The Supreme Court did send a special messenger, but the messenger didn't return in time and the Court had to adjourn with any potential action pushed back until January 1833 when the court would reconvene. At this point the court had asked Jackson to do nothing, which is exactly what he did, although being an election year his enemies began to attack him on the grounds he wouldn't enforce it.\n\nComplicating everything is the Judiciary Act of 1789, in particular section 25 ( which dealt with the courts ability to issue decrees of habeas corpus) and had some rather appalling defects. For instance it specifically allowed for the court to issue writs when held under federal authority but made no provision for state authority. It was also doubtful that the Court could act on any of the other provisions within the act of 1789 because the act also required a written record of the refusal of a state court to carry out its decree. So if a state chose to ignore the Court it is unclear what if anything the Court could do. Wirt actually recognized this and attempted to have congress to alter the act of 1789 to allow the court to act immediately if it seemed likely a state court would resist the Supreme Court's decree. He also argued for strengthening the militia act of 1795 which would have required the President to summon militia to carry out the decisions of the court. Ultimately no immediate solution presented itself and Jackson quipped in April of 1832 \"the decision of the Supreme Court has fell still born, and they find it cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate\". \n\nTo be fair Jackson wasn't a big fan of Marshall, or the Supreme Court in general for that matter, and while we are at it he did support state jurisdiction over native nations. While the statement \"Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it\" is almost assuredly apocryphal, Marshall had voted against Jackson in 1828( after a long sabbatical from politics) and the case was viewed as Marshall throwing his lot in the Anti-Jackson forces. Despite this nothing Jackson said in his public addresses during this time can be construed as favoring an assault on the Federal courts. In fact Jackson's only comments seem to be more concerned with extending the Court system into the Western territories where they were lacking. Jackson's lack of confrontation possibly stems from the impending election, or the more likely realization that Jackson had a strong possibility of stacking the court with his own state's rights men (which in fact happened, with many of them continuing to serve through the Civil War era). What is clear is Jackson wished to avoid a fight in fact writing to the Georgia Governor in June of 1832 stating \"My Great Desire was that you should do no act which would give the Federal court a legal jurisdiction over a case that might arise with the Cherokees.\" \n\nUltimately in a rather non climatic end to the story Georgia compromised and released the men while continuing to reject the Federal government's authority over Native Land.\n\n\nEdited for Sources:\n\n*The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and Nullification Crisis*\n\n*Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Freedom, 1822-1832*\n\n ",

        "author": "nilhaus",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/28kclw/the_texas_nationalist_movement_really_bad_answers/",
        "text": "[The webpage in question](http://texnat.org/index.php/intro-to-texas-independence/answers-about-independence)\n\nThe Texas Nationalist Movement is pretty self explanatory. They are a political group that wants Texas to become a separate nation from the rest of the United States. I’m going to skip over most of the legal semantics games this site plays and focus on the history. I feel I should point out the page uses lots of weasel words like “*Some people* feel this is illegal…” without ever saying who. They also refer to the American Civil War as the War Between the States, which makes it sound legal. I was almost hoping they called it the War of Northern Aggression so I could feel justified in imagining them all as Yosemite Sams. \n\nThese questions come from their FAQ.\n\n&gt; **Does Texas have a secession clause in its annexation agreement?:**\n&gt; No. There is no explicit clause in the Joint Resolution of Annexation stating that Texas has a special right of secession. It is an understood right given to all states when they joined the Union.\n\nThey get this a little right. Texas has no secession clauses of any kind, not just a lack of explicit clauses. Admittedly, there was talk of secession clauses from the drafting of the Articles of Confederation through the American Civil War, and it was never explicit whether or not a state could secede. History would be on the side of the Federalists who pushed for an indivisible union of states. At the Constitutional Convention, Madison stating: *\"the Constitution requires an adoption in toto, and for ever\".* Hamilton and Jay added that *\"a right to withdraw [was] inconsistent with the Constitution, and was no ratification.\"* Interestingly, it was New York who wanted a secession clause in the Constitution. States backed away from their objections and calls for clauses for secession and signed the Constitution. So no, states did not understood the right to secede at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. They may have assumed that was the case, and had some tenuous ground to stand on, but it was never a clear understanding. The states that joined the Union after 1865 certainly understood that secession would not be tolerated. \n\n&gt; **Weren't there irregularities in the annexation of Texas?:**\n&gt; Yes. Texas was a recognized foreign nation at the time of annexation. The proper constitutional procedure for dealing with foreign nations is by treaty. The treaty of annexation, ratified by the Senate of the Republic of Texas, was not ratified by the United States Senate. The United States Congress passed a Joint Resolution of Annexation which was offered to the Republic of Texas. It was accepted by the convention and put to a vote of the people of Texas.\n\nI don’t know of any annexation that can be considered \"regular\", as each one has it’s own unique story. I’m also not sure what they’re on about here with a lack of ratification by the Senate. They even agree that the treaty was ratified by a joint resolution with the House and Senate. The only difference in the joint resolution over a pure Senatorial ratification is that the Joint Resolution required two simple majorities rather than one majority vote just from the Senate. Something can’t be ratified by the whole Congress but not the Senate since the Senate is part of Congress! Irregular? Yes but to imply there is something illegal or improper about it is looking for straws to grasp. Even if irregular it does not suddenly grant Texas the ability to legally secede. \n\n&gt;**Did the Supreme Court make secession illegal in Texas v. White?**\n\nI'm not going to quote the whole thing, and there is a lot of legal semantics I won’t address since I'm not a lawyer. Texas v. White did not make secession illegal. Secession was never legal in the first place since there is no clause to explicitly allow it or disallow it. Texas v. White reaffirmed the lack of secession as an option for states. The Chief Justice clarified that the Constitution was not a pact with the states that would create a confederation, but the creation of a Union of States which was indivisible. Chase, the Chief Justice, makes it quite clear: \n\n*“When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.”*\n\nJust to clarify, when Chase adds at the end *\"except through revolution or through consent of the States.”* he isn't being hypocritical in saying these are viable ways to secede. He's saying that this would destroy the Union, after which the states are basically free to do whatever they want since they aren't bound by a Constitution anymore.\n\nTheir next jab is at the alleged impropriety of the court in not recusing themselves from the case. Apparently, the Chief Justice should not have heard the case since the case had to do with bonds and Chase had been the Secretary of the Treasury in from 1861 to 1864, five years prior to this case. They make it sound like he was Chief Justice and Secretary of the Treasury at the same time. Chase had nothing to do with the bonds that Texas issued while it was an independent country or part of the Confederacy, and his involvement in the Treasury is hardly grounds for recusing yourself from this case. He went on to rule on a number of cases involving finances and the Treasure to little protest or calls for recusement. \n\nThey go on to state that five of the others should have recused themselves as well, since they were Lincoln appointees and they were apparently justifying his war. Well, first off the President doesn't declare war, Congress does. And since Congress didn't appoint the Supreme Court Justices I don't see the conflict of interest. Secondly War was never declared on the Confederate States since they were not a recognized government, so no real justification was needed. Anyway, the Confederacy fired the first shot, so at worst the Union was fighting a defensive war, justifications aside. If these secessionists had their way there would only have been two Justices left to rule on the case since there were only eight Supreme Court Justices in 1869. \n\n&gt; **Didn't the Civil War settle the issue of states leaving the Union?:**\n&gt; For some it did. But this is the equivalent of saying that armed robbery is legal if the robber is successful in his crime. Just as robbery is morally and legally wrong and the violence initiated to achieve his goal is also morally and legally wrong, so is the use of violence to deny the fundamental right of self-government. Just like a victim of a robbery will work to reclaim their property, we will work to reclaim our right of self-determination and self-government. Only then will the issue be settled.\n\nThe irony is truly palpable. They make an interesting point, but I think they got things backwards. They cast the Union as the robber of property instead of the Confederacy. To speak of the moral right of the Confederacy to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of enslaved people is infuriating. Who is denying who the fundamental right of self-government again? I can only assume when they say they will fight to reclaim their property they mean those troublesome slaves who Lincoln freed. \n\nThere is plenty of other bad history and bad politics to go around on this web page, along with a healthy dose of delusion at their chances of success. I wanted to go into comparing the secession of West Virginia from the seceded Virginia as a precedent for legal secession, but I don't have the energy anymore.\n\nEdit: Thanks to /u/Irishfafnir for some clarifications and educating discussion",

The [article linked](http://www.criminalelement.com/blogs/2012/07/the-problem-with-lori-feminism-and-the-walking-dead-angie-barry-thriller-zombies) (which uses the same title) obviously has nothing to do with the Stone Age.\n\n/r/atheism:\n\n&gt;[Freedom is enslaving yourself to a Bronze Age, poorly translated text cited by people who want to control your life? Right](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/11dlac/freedom_is_enslaving_yourself_to_a_bronze_age/)...\n\n[And much more.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/search?q=bronze+age&amp;restrict_sr=on) Christianity is obviously not a Bronze Age religion--the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age Collapse was around 1200 BCE. Judaism's development is also solidly within the context of the Iron Age Levant. The Torah was probably composed in the sixth or so century BCE, so unless it was written in Thailand it can't be called 'Bronze Age. [Bonus](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/hve5r/am_i_the_only_one_that_is_annoyed_by_the_bronze/):\n\n&gt;Am i the only one that is annoyed by the \"Bronze Age\" slight on Christianity?\n\n&gt;&gt;To name a few, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates (if he even existed) were all bronze age thinkers, and they were okay in my books! Being 'bronze age' or not shouldn't be the focus (as it is in millions of rage comics) of our attention....the non-sensical reasoning is what should be pointed out!\n\nSee point one.\n\nSo as this is a common trope than really a discrete unit of bad history, so I culled it by using search functions to give an example from three distinct subreddits: a social issues subreddit, a general issues subreddit outside of the Reddit norm (sad as that it to say), and an old courageous friend. So this isn't exactly a problem limited to one sphere of Reddit, it is everywhere, and is really more deeply entrenched in our culture at large. It is a deeply entrenched teleological view of history, in which \"future\" equals perfect, \"now\" equals good, and \"then\" equals bad, and the more \"then\" you get, the more bad you get. This ignores the way that many things we identify as social ills, such as racism, violence, and superstition are the products of specific historical causes.\n\nA great example of this is segregation, which is thoroughly embedded into our cultural narrative as a \"then\", something associated with the unsophisticated, dangerous and rural past. In reality, racial segregation is something that developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in response to emancipation, and \"[hypersegregation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#Hypersegregation)\" (which is what we usually think of) developed in the early twentieth century in response to increasing black urbanization (there is a similar pattern in South Africa). This example also gives another example of why this is a problem, because in many ways segregation is still a thing. If we pat ourselves on the back too much about being more just, more intelligent and more reasonable than those who came before we ignore the real problems in our own society.\n\nWhile this doesn't seem to stick out as much as page long dissertation on why Tamerlane did nothing wrong, this sort of casual bad history both reveals and reinforces broader and deeper beliefs about the past. It seems nitpicky, but there is a real seriousness behind it.\n\nEDIT: Huh, no accounting for taste it seems. Incidentally, the gold message has some bad history:\n\n&gt; Venice introduced the gold ducat in 1284 and it became the most popular gold coin in the world for the next 500 years. Ducat is Latin for \"duke.\"\n\nI'm not entirely certain how you can compare the relative popularity for Ducats, Florins, solidi, etc, but they were probably all in lesser circulation than Chinese cash. Also, \"ducat\" is definitely not Latin for \"duke\" although they both share a common root with classical *dux*.",

Here it is:\n\n\nDear editorial staff,\n\nI was going to write an introduction, but I just don't have it in me. So, without further ado, let me do the job you apparently decided not to:\n\n&gt;Gertrude of Arabia, the Woman Who Invented Iraq\n\nOh, really? What about it did she invent, exactly? Where was it before? Did she just, you know, whole sale create the people and the place, like some capricious god? The point is she didn't invent the concept of Iraq. Before Iraq, there was Baghdad Eyalet, and Mamluk Iraq, and I don't even want to continue further because literally looking at any of those wikipedia pages(the literal bare minimum the articles author could have done, which he didn't do) should prove that there was a concept of Iraq as being lands roughly similar to what we know today. That doesn't answer the question of whether Iraq should stay together today, but it let's you know that the concept goes back farther than one person. Oh, also problematic in just the headline to your article?\n\n&gt;Gertrude of Arabia, the Woman Who Invented Iraq\n\nYou obviously missed it, since it is literally the whole title. The idea that one person invents a country in a vacuum is just insulting. Say, for example, if I made the claim 'Hitler invented Nazi Germany.' Boy, you'd say, that's a strong claim! I don't think You can back that up! And you'd be right. Of course we know that it isn't so much that Hitler invented Nazi Germany than the millions of events that led, not inevitably, to the Nazis rising to power. So, Gertrude Bell invented Iraq. Boy, I say, that seems suspicious! Did no one else help her? I guess I didn't realize she was in charge of British colonial holdings in the middle east, and was also a native local leader, and the native populace, and.... and you get my point. Here's a headline for you: Gertrude Bell, participant in the formation of the British Mandate of Iraq (edit: BM of Mesopotamia). If you claim anything beyond that, you're going to have to write something a lot longer than you did. \n\nBuckle up, this is going to take a while.\n\n\n&gt;The story of the British intelligence agent who rigged an election, installed a king loyal to the British, drew new borders—and gave us today’s ungovernable country.\n\nOh man.  That's some strong claims.\n\n&gt;It was a hundred years ago, a few months before the outbreak of World War I. Baghdad was under a regime loyal to the Ottoman Turks.\n\nYou mean it was under pretty direct control of the Ottomans, at least, I hope you mean that. Since the Mamluks (who somehow never get brought up in your story) had been deposed decades earlier.\n \n&gt;The Turkish authorities in Constantinople had reluctantly given the persistent woman permission to embark on her desert odyssey, believing her to be an archaeologist and Arab scholar, as well as being a species of lunatic English explorer that they had seen before.\n\nShe *was* an archaeologist and Arab scholar. Hell, her most important work was arguably her White Paper “Review of the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia\", of which Rory Stewart, in his [excellent article](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2007/oct/25/the-queen-of-the-quagmire/?pagination=false) on Bell in the N.Y. Review of books, says this:\n\n&gt;&gt;Bell’s most significant legacy is her magisterial government White Paper “Review of the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia”—comparable in its historical context to General Petraeus’s recent report to Congress—which was applauded by both houses of Parliament when presented to a skeptical government in 1920. She surveys with Augustan detachment the expenditures of the departments of agriculture and irrigation and the murder of her friends. She draws comparisons with the Indian land registry in 1834 and digresses into devil-worshiping, Armenian massacres, and jokes about “Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt.” She summarizes in Gibbonian rhetoric the flaws in British policy and also cites some remarkable achievements: a railway system with 27,000 staff members, district hospitals, schools for girls, and a police force. Her view is frequently unsettling. She supports imperfect solutions pursued in defiance of liberal values and human rights: compromises with warlords, punitive raids, and tribal justice. But her culture, her audience, and her background make her aspire, despite the political pressures of that moment, to tell the truth.\n\nWow, how interesting! If only we had access to that white paper. Man! It'd be so interesting to read some of it. Oh, wait, it's in the [public domain](http://archive.org/stream/reviewofciviladm00iraqrich/reviewofciviladm00iraqrich_djvu.txt). Here's an interesting excerpt on Kurdistan, and those arbitrary boundaries from your title:\n\n&gt;&gt;After some discussion a document was drawn up in the following sense :\n\n&gt;&gt;\"His British Majesty's Government having announced that their intention in the war was the liberation of the Eastern peoples from Turkish oppression and the grant of assistance to them in the establishment of their independence, the chiefs, as the representatives of the people of Kurdistan, have asked His British Majesty's Government to accept them also under British protection and to attach them to the Iraq, so that they might not be deprived of the benefits of that association, and they have requested the Civil Commissioner of Mesopotamia to send them a representative with the necessary assistance to enable the Kurdish people under British auspices to progress peacefully on civilised lines.If His British Majesty's Government extend its assistance and protection to them they undertook to accept His British Majesty's orders and advice.\n\n&gt;&gt;In return the Civil Commissioner signed a document stating that any Kurdish tribe from the Greater Zab to the Diyala (other than those in Persian territory) who of their own free will accepted the leadership of Shaykh Mahmud, would be allowed to do so, and that the latter would have our moral support in controlling the above areas on behalf of the British Government whose orders he undertook to obey. The tribes and townspeople in the Kifri and Kirkuk divisions were not willing to come under Shaikh Mahmud, and the latter agreed not to insist on their inclusion. Kirkuk subsequently become an independent Division.\n\n&gt;&gt;It was explained to the representatives of the Kurdish tribes in Persia that our public engagements precluded us from agreeing to their inclusion in the south Kurdistan confederacy under British protection, and that they must remain loyal Persian subjects, keeping on friendly terms with the confederation. They accepted the position cheerfully. \n\n&gt;&gt;Shaikh Mahmud further asked for British officers for all Government departments, including officers for Kurdish levies, stipulating only that the subordinate staff should, wherever possible, be Kurdish, and not Arab. \n\n&gt;&gt;After the meeting many tribes came into the confederation, and when on 1st January 1919 Major Noel went to Rawanduz, he found the population there to be apparently favourable to Shaikh Mahmud. As Major Soane observed in his administrative report on the Sulaimaniyah Division for 1919, so anxious were the Kurds at that time for peace, so reduced by privation, that they were ready to sign any document or make any statement to procure tranquillity and food. Thus tribe after tribe which hitherto had been barely cognisant of Shaikh Mahmud, or at best had known him as an unworthy descendant of a good man, signed the stereotyped memorial praying for inclusion in the new State under Shaikh Mahmud, a condition which they imagined the British Government to have made essential, for reasons of its own. At the same time his appointment as British representative was regarded with suspicion, and there was considerable scepticism as to the defeat of the Turk, owing to the proximity of Ottoman garrisons and the activity of Ottoman officials on the other side of the frontier.\n\nOf course Mahmud himself would later revolt several times against the British and Iraqis in an effort to establish a separate Kurdish state, but the above bit of history is more interesting than anything in your article.\n\nYou could talk about, for example, the joint British-Iraqi offer made on December 20, 1922 that offered Kurdistan a form of independence (though Lord (edit: Sir. Can't believe the typos I made) Percy, of course, assured King Faisal behind closed doors that that wouldn't be on the table). Kurdish internal disagreements meant that they couldn't even agree enough to send delegates to discuss the offer, and it was rejected by, you guessed it, Shaikh Mahmud himself, the self proclaimed King of the Kurds at the time. Whoo, baby, now that's interesting. It becomes clearer and clearer that todays ungovernable country was also yesterdays same ungovernable country.\n\n&gt;She was, in fact, a spy and her British masters had told her that if she got into trouble they would disclaim responsibility for her. Less than 10 years later Gertrude Bell would be back in Baghdad, having rigged an election, installed a king loyal to the British, re-organized the government, and fixed the borders on the map of a new Iraq. As much as anyone can be, Gertrude Bell could be said to have devised the country that nobody can make work as a country for very long—no more so than now.\n\nContinued in the comments",

Half the reason the patent system exists is so that clever inventions will be *publicized*, so that people like Edison can build upon them. \n\nTesla didn't invent alternating current and wasn't a major figure in the \"War of the Currents,\" which is the myth that \"patent-thieving\" refers to.\n\n&gt; **and becomes the only inventor whose name most Americans know.**\n\nSee also: [second-opinion bias](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pqzx5/objectively_speaking_what_the_nazi_regime_did_is/cd54xw0)",

Being an avid history geek and a fan of objectivity (and with recent focus on gender issues) I find it problematic that /u/cordis_melum is moderating this sub because /u/cordis_melum is clearly heavily invested in the gender debate, which I'm sure many of us appreciate.

And I'll admit this is all totally low-hanging fruit, but shoot,what else do I have to do right now?\n\nSo the article was stupid, but what really blew my mind was the comment at the bottom of the page:\n\n&gt; Whites are the least racist and most generous ethnic group in all of human history. Consider the following.\n\n&gt; Slavery: Only white countries abolished slavery for moral reasons (in some cases, anyway).\n\n&gt; Colonialism: Only white countries surrendered the lands they conquered for moral reasons (in some cases, anyway).\n\nSo, maybe I'm out of the loop, but this is the first time I've ever seen *slavery and colonialism* used as examples of why white people are \"the least racist ethnic group in all of human history.\" Now, I'm a musicology student, not a historian. But I'm *pretty sure* white people were responsible for large-scale, race-based chattel slavery for hundreds of years. As I understand it, while white Europeans were busy inventing music, there may have been a major institution of slavery in the Americas. I think there was eventually some kind of war fought in America over the right to own slaves. For all I know, hundreds of thousands of people died in the fight to preserve the institution of slavery. I don't know these things.\n\nBut, because white people are the least racist people in all of history, they eventually \"abolished slavery for moral reasons (in some cases, anyway).\" \n\nSimilarly, we know that white people never coarsely justified their colonial activities by asserting that \"orientals\" were incapable of managing their own lands. This is something I do know about, because white composers were generous enough to incorporate \"exotic\" and themes into their music, so that \"primitive\" peoples' music could be real music too. \n\nThen, when the whites had finished \"building the country from the ground up,\" they were generous enough to give it to the people they liberated. Again, for \"moral reasons.\"\n\nI actually thought the whole comment was a joke, at first, but it goes on.\n\n&gt; Culture: Only white people downplay their ancestors' accomplishments (Western civilization) while glorifying the accomplishments of other races (rap music).\n\nI don't know from historiography. But I'm inclined to think that the history of Western civilization has not been downplayed anywhere. Again, I'm not a historian. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThere's much more in there, but it's late and I'm tired.\n\n&gt; Manners: White people are nice.",

Additional disclaimer:  this is my first post and I am far from an historian so be gentle with me.\n\nAs many of you may know, a significant portion of Game of Thrones' story takes place at [The Wall](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wall), which our reliable friend the ASoIaF wiki describes as \"a massive wall over 700 feet high and is made of ice, stretching 300 miles across the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms, separating it from the wild lands beyond.\"  Pretty badass, but not entirely realistic--though in a series predicated upon magic, dragons, and what are essentially zombies, it's not the craziest thing.\n\nWhat appears in a lot of discussions about the Wall is, of course, a parallel between GoT's Wall and Hadrian's Wall, which is explicitly where GRR Martin got the idea.  In an interview with Rolling Stone, Martin stated that he \"was in England visiting a friend, and as we approached the border of England and Scotland, we stopped to see Hadrian's Wall...when you write fantasy, everything is bigger and more colorful, so I took the Wall and made it three times as long and 700 feet high, and made it out of ice.\"^1  Pretty cool, right?  And after all, it is pretty standard to draw inspiration from the real world to write fantasy.\n\nAn example of the kind of things always mention in discussions of the Wall is this [comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/287r3m/no_spoilers_a_mapped_history_of_a_song_of_ice_and/ci8k0u4) in /r/gameofthrones .  This is essentially paraphrasing the rest of what Martin said regarding the Wall in the same interview:  \"I stood up there and I tried to imagine what it was like to be a Roman legionary, standing on this wall, looking at these distant hills. It was a very profound feeling. For the Romans at that time, this was the end of civilization; it was the end of the world. We know that there were Scots beyond the hills, but they didn't know that. It could have been any kind of monster. It was the sense of this barrier against dark forces – it planted something in me.\"^1\n\nSo there are a couple of problems with this.  I think that the biggest one is the implication that the Romans had no idea about what was happening beyond Hadrian's Wall, or that they had no contact with Caledonia or the Picts.  The Romans clearly would have understood a lot about Caledonia well before the erection of Hadrian's Wall (which I'll call HW from now on because I'm tired of typing it out) between 122-128 AD.  The best example of this is the fact that a large Roman army under Agricola [invaded Caledonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola#The_invasion_of_Caledonia_.28Scotland.29) and fought Calgacus, who, through Tacitus, gives us the famous quote:  \"They create a desolation and call it peace.\"^2  So right away this invalidates Martin's idea that the Romans didn't know that there were \"Scots,\" as he calls them, beyond HW.  According to Wiki, the Romans also knew that Britain was an island, but this is unsourced so I don't know whether or not to trust it.  Furthermore, they knew that Caledonians/Picts/whoever were living beyond HW when they invaded Britannia in 180 and rampaged around for a couple of years.\n\nSecond of all is a less concrete objection:  from everything that I have learned about HW, it served as more of a customs wall than an explicitly defensive installation.  Logically, the scale of the wall was not enough to prevent the invasions that occurred occasionally--the aforementioned invasion in 180 and another attack on the frontier in 197, then one in 210.^3  While describing the scholarly controversy surrounding the purpose of HW, [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall#Purpose_of_construction) says that the \"*limites* of Rome were never expected to stop whole tribes from migrating or entire armies from invading, and while a frontier protected by a palisade or stone wall would surely help curb cattle-raiders and the incursions of other small groups, the economic viability of constructing and constantly manning a 72-mile (116 km) long boundary along a sparsely populated border to stop small-scale raiding is dubious.\"^4  According to Everitt, HW also provided a significant degree of control over immigration and the movement of population.  This section, again, is open to debate.\n\nFinally, and I won't have any sources for this, I have a problem with Martin's characterization of the Roman mind, which isn't limited to Martin at all but occurs pretty frequently, examples often showing up on this sub.  There seems to be a need for people to think of ancient peoples as stupid and superstitious.  The problem is that the territory immediately on either side of HW looked pretty damn similar, and as I mentioned before, the Romans had been north of HW many times.  There's no reason to think that they would have thought that Caledonia was inhabited by anyone but people--admittedly, weird people with weird habits and political structures that the Romans didn't know much about, but people nonetheless.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, if it inspired something as cool as the Wall in GoT, I'll let it slide.\n\n[1] [Rolling Stones Interview](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/george-r-r-martin-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140423?page=2)\n\n[2] Tacitus, *Agricola* 38\n\n[3] [Wikipedia article \"Caledonians\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonians)\n\n[4] Wiki here cites Anthony Everitt's *Hadrian and the Triumph of Rome* and Stephen Johnson's *Hadrian's Wall*.",

        "text": "So yesterday I came across [this video](http://www.viralforest.com/watch-1000-years-european-borders-change/) in /r/eu4, which claims to show \"1000 Years of European Borders Change In 3 Minutes\". The fact that it starts in 1140 and ends in 2012 and thus only really covers 872 years seems to be the least of its worries...\n\nLet's start with the year [1342](http://i.imgur.com/x3WFslw.png). Denmark owns Norway... this would probably be the then 10 year-old Olav of Denmark inheriting the Norwegian crown from his father, Haakon VI of Norway, making the first step towards the establishment of the Kalmar Union, which united the whole of Scandinavia under the Danish crown for almost 150 years. The only problem is that scenario only happened in 1376.  \nThen also, we can see Poland under Hungarian colours. This should be the Angevin union, which brought Louis I of Hungary to the Polish throne after the death of the last of the Piast kings, Casimir III. That union went from 1370 up to the death of Louis in 1382. \n\nThen in [1354](http://i.imgur.com/y9c4LDe.png) we find the Kalmar Union fully established. Did you know that it was named after the Swedish Kalmar castle where the official treaty was signed? Did you also know that this happened in 1397? Then you know more than the makers of this map.  \nYou may also look at East Europe and wonder how Poland-Lithuania appeared there already, since the Union of Krewo was only established in 1386, when Poland elected the Lithuanian Grand Duke Władysław II Jagiełło as their monarch in exchange for the conversion of the Lithuanian pagans to Catholicism and some territory stuff.\n\nBig leap now: [1763](http://i.imgur.com/pp5sTMb.png). In the lower right corner you might notice it says „Qajar Persia“. This must have been a shock to Karim Khan Zand, since the Qajar dynasty only came to power in the 1790s, following Karim's death in 1779 and lots of [crazy slaughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman#History) to fill some history books.  \nAnd if you're looking for Poland you've come too late as it appears Austria, Prussia and Russia have prematurely started the First Partition of Poland. Waiting for 1772? Ain't nobody got time for that!\n\nBrace yourselves, we're getting into the Napoleonic Wars. The year is [1789](http://i.imgur.com/QAKi4Sh.png). French revolutionaries on the way to the Bastille in Paris bring the wrong map and suddenly find themselves at the Neman, having stormed the whole of Prussia instead of a fortress. How embarrassing.  \nBavaria and Italy meanwhile, not wanting to wait for the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, have gone ahead and prematurely snatched Tyrol and Vorarlberg and also Venice, Istria and Dalmatia from Austria.  \n\nThree years later, in [1792](http://i.imgur.com/cVTAFmj.png), we find the Duchy of Warsaw, actually established by Napoleon in 1807 after the Treaty of Tilsit to weaken Prussia and get the Polish on his side.\n\nThen we fast forwars to the year [1900](http://i.imgur.com/0ImJEmI.png). Germany has just executed the Schlieffen plan, occupying Belgium and Luxembourg and advancing on Paris while storming into Russian territory in the East. I don't think I need to say too much about the problems here. Fortunately, in [1910](http://i.imgur.com/RU1Vdo3.png) we find the war ended and Austria and Germany broken.   \nNotice that Latvia is the same colour as Germany, so the creator has obviously chosen to represent the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, which was established as a German vassal state in March 1918 and proclaimed independence after Germany's Novemberrevolution of the same year. At the same time other short-lived Balkan states were just ignored, for example the Belarusian People's Republic existed from March 1918 to January 1919, so even longer than Courland.\n\nAnd as a bonus picture here is the year Austria and West Germany became independent states and the ten year occupations were lifted. What a lovely year, this [1955](http://i.imgur.com/dSriLWX.png).\n\nThere is most likely heaps of errors I didn't even catch since since it was just so much and in such a low resolution. ",

        "text": "So, Pope Francis did an interview with \"La Vanguardia\" recently.  [The full text in English is available here](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-interview-with-la-vanguardia---full-text-45430/).  During the interview the subject of Pius XII during WWII was brought up.  I'll have more on that further down, but the offending bad history text is quoted below:\n\n&gt;Did you know that they knew the rail network of the Nazis perfectly well to take the Jews to concentration camps? They had the pictures. But they did not bomb those railroad tracks. Why? It would be best if we spoke a bit about everything.\n\nWell, papa, I am a Catholic.  I love the Church, and I take my faith seriously.  I'm a student of papal history and of WWII, especially military aviation.  I take *all* of that seriously.  You're not the first to ask why the rail lines to the death camps weren't bombed, and you won't be the last.  It seems like a great solution--just keep the Jews from being delivered to the camps!  \n\nSadly, it wasn't that easy or simple.\n\nEven if we disregard the immense cost of bombing operations (both in terms of economic cost and that of human lives) and the difficulties of targeting something even further east than most of the bombers' normal targets (which were already near the limits of their endurance), we would still have a major issue to deal with if we determine that attacking the rail lines leading to death camps is important enough to divert the bombers from their other targets.  Further, any kind of precision bombing had to be done in daylight.  That was murderously expensive at best prior to 1944, with first the British then the Americans learning the harsh lesson that bombers without fighter escorts could not sustainably bomb targets in Germany during daylight.  And by \"sustainably\" I mean that bombers and crews were being lost at such a rate that the force would be destroyed in a handful of missions.  Only after long-range fighter escorts were created in 1944 were the bombers able to keep up a daylight offensive for any length of time.  So, only in 1944 and 1945 would such a sustained campaign against rail lines leading to death camps even be possible.  *But that's not even the issue*.\n\nThe issue is this:  WWII bombers were largely ineffective against rail lines.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this.  The first is that WWII bombers were not accurate enough to reliably *hit* a rail line.  Keep in mind the very nature of a set of rails--they are a ribbon of infrastructure mere feet wide that snakes through the country.  Now we add the difficulties of WWII bombing that resulted in most bombs ending up nowhere near their intended target.  Specific factories were often missed by the bombers tasked to destroy them, and there were many times in which entire *cities* were missed by the bombers.  The 'solution' to this difficulty was to send more bombers (again, at great expense) so that you could drop more bombs in the hope that one of those bombs would hit its target.  This was somewhat effective.\n\nThere were operations undertaken against German rail lines.  Most prominently, they were targeted as part of the 'Transportation Plan' prior to D-Day.  As reconnaissance during the war indicated and surveys after the war confirmed, there was some success *for a time*.  Rail lines, if targeted with large numbers of bombers, could be disrupted--but only for a short time.  But unless a bridge or viaduct was somehow heavily damaged or destroyed (something only 'tallboy' and 'grand slam' bombs very late in the war had any real chance of accomplishing), the railroad would be repaired in short order.  Basically, most of the time the trains were able to roll through the targeted area in 24 hours.  This is partly due to the aforementioned difficulties in targeting rail lines, but the Germans also had dedicated forces to repairing railroad damage.  In addition, these units would compel local people to assist in the reconstruction of the rail line.  Further, outside of bridges and viaducts railroads are basically piles of rocks and gravel with a little wood and steel beams on top.  This means that low-tech solutions were perfectly suitable to fixing the damage caused by relatively high-tech instruments such as heavy four engine bombers equipped with every modern piece of equipment.  German railways only collapsed extremely late in the war, basically when every other service had also shut down and the government had effectively collapsed.\n\nIn the final analysis, rail lines could only be cut on a *tactical* basis.  Within a matter of hours repairs on a damaged line could be completed, so to ensure that a rail line was not used it would have to be retargeted multiple times.  This meant that the bombers could not be used to attack other targets that were also deemed worthy of their attention.  So, to target the railways leading to the death camps, bombers would have to undergo great risks (at great expense both in money and men) repeatedly (because the Germans had great success in repairing rail lines within hours) to even have a *chance* at success, and other targets would have to be neglected.  So, even had Allied command known every detail of the horrors of the camps, it would have had to be an immense undertaking to try to interdict travel to those camps.\n\nSo, papa, the Allies couldn't have bombed the rail lines leading to the camps.  Not really.  They would have had to dedicate a huge proportion of their bomber force to accomplish the task, the costs would have been very high, and forced laborers with nothing more complex than a shovel could have repaired the damage in less than a day making it necessary to repeat the dangerous operation all over again the next day.  Using low-level attacks by smaller bombers would have been impossible because those bombers didn't have the range to get the job done (and would have had smaller bomb loads anyway).  Even isolating the Normandy battlefield was a huge stretch for the Allied bombing force, and they still chafed at being used in such a role instead of attacking German industry.  \n\nIt sounds like a great solution, but the realities of bombing in WWII didn't allow for simply isolating the death camps by cutting their rail lines.  Even then, we would have had no guarantees that the Germans wouldn't have simply found another way of carrying out their murderous policies--in the same way that they found a way to increase wartime production during 1944-45 despite the increasingly devastating attacks of the same bombers in question.\n\nSources:\n\nChristian Wollmar, *Engines at War*\n\nMartin Van Creveld, *Age of Airpower*\n\n Walter J. Boyne, *Clash of Wings*\n\nRobert Leckie, *Delivered from Evil*\n\n---------------------------------\n\nOn Pius XII, Francis did pretty well on the history front.\n\n&gt;Interviewer:  One of your projects is to open the Vatican archives on the Holocaust.\n\n&gt;Francis:  They will bring a lot of light.   \n\n&gt;Interviewer:  Does it worry you something could be discovered?\n\n&gt;Francis:  What worries me regarding this subject is the figure of Pius XII, the Pope that led the Church during World War II. They have said all sorts of things about poor Pius XII. But we need to remember that before he was seen as the great defender of the Jews. He hid many in convents in Rome and in other Italian cities, and also in the residence of Castel Gandolfo. Forty-two babies, children of Jews and other persecuted who sought refuge there were born there, in the Pope’s room, in his own bed. I don’t want to say that Pius XII did not make any mistakes - I myself make many - but one needs to see his role in the context of the time. For example, was it better for him not to speak so that more Jews would not be killed or for him to speak? I also want to say that sometimes I get “existential hives” when I see that everyone takes it out against the Church and Pius XII, and they forget the great powers.\n\nThis joins up to the above \"bad history\" quote.  Most of the Catholic officials that sheltered Jews in Italy do credit Pius XII's directions to do so.  Pius XII did indeed shelter Jews in Castel Gandolfo--the traditional vacation/retreat home for the pontiff that Pius XII famously had a particular love for.  There was also a decidedly mixed record during the war when various people spoke out against atrocities--sometimes it made things worse and sometimes it didn't.\n\nFrancis's remarks on Pius XII during the war didn't grab my attention.  This part did:\n\n&gt;They (the Vatican archives on the Holocaust) will bring a lot of light.   \n\nThe Vatican generally waits 75 years to release documents on a given issue or pontiff.  That 75 year wait would now theoretically allow documents from 1939--the year Pius XII was elected and obviously the beginning of WWII in Europe.  Now, after *The Deputy* began the controversy about Pius XII in 1963 the Vatican broke its own rules and got four scholars to go through the archives and release some documents early.  The result was the [Acts and Documents of the Holy See Relative to the Second World War](http://www.vatican.va/archive/actes/index_en.htm).  This is an eleven volume set of primary documents (with a bit of analysis at the beginning of each book) that outline much of what we currently know about Pius XII during WWII.  There have been allegations that the documents released were not complete enough and hid evidence, particularly about Croatia.\n\nBut there hasn't been much chatter about the documents not including all of the evidence that is *positive* about Pius XII.\n\nSo I have been chewing on this all weekend.  Has Francis seen an early version of what's going to be released?  \"A lot of light\"?  He certainly doesn't seem too worried about the idea; he seems eager to get the documents out.  I guess we'll find out what he means soon.\n\nOf course, this is the Vatican definition of \"soon.\"  That basically translates to \"we think the current pope will be alive to see this, unless something happens, and so long as the proper forms are properly filled out in triplicate.  Also, most of us that work here are Italian, so we could be delayed by something as simple as the World Cup or a cup of espresso.  So, yeah, soon.\"",

        "text": "Greetings all! \n\nI’m back for part two of two reviews of the contact period badhistory in the Powhatan/Jamestown mythology. My first Jamestown badhistory review featured an [analysis of Disney’s *Pocahontas* (1995)](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/27mmw6/bad_history_movie_review_contact_period_bad/) and provided some background on Powhatan history, a review of the major players in the story (Powhatan, Pocahontas, John Smith, Percy the Pug, etc.), and a brief discussion of how elements of the Jamestown mythology evolved over 400 years. This review will focus on the later potions of the mythology omitted in the Disney story, namely the deterioration of conditions at Jamestown, Pocahontas’s abduction, conversion, marriage to John Rolfe, and fatal journey to England. A few caveats before we begin. First, I’m not primarily a Powhatan or Jamestown historian and there are reams of published material in this area. Please identify any mistakes so I can learn from my errors. Second, for my sanity, and time constraints, I aim for ~2,000 words with these posts so this is not an exhaustive review of the movie. Please add more information and discuss further.\n\nOne final note, since the movie chose not to call any Powhatan characters by their name (save Pocahontas after she is baptized Rebecca, and a brief mention of Pocahontas’s uncle Patowomeck right before he sells her for a copper kettle) I will refer to all the English characters by their best known roles in other films.\n\n**Now to the movie…**\n\n1:00 Matoaka/Pocahontas praying to the Great Mother. After auditioning thousands, Q’orianka Kilcher earned the role of Pocahontas. She was 14 when filming the movie, while the real Pocahontas was roughly 10 when the Jamestown settlers landed in Virginia. As a fun aside, Kilcher’s paternal ancestry shows how the ripples of contact are still unfolding across the Americas. Kilcher’s father is Quechua-Huachipaeri from the Madre de Dios region of Peru. Contact with most Huachipaeri (Harakmbut) and Piro along the Madre de Dios River began with Dominican missions established in the 1940s, and several years ago [previously isolated foraging Piro appeared on the banks of the Madre de Dios](http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2012/02/13/guardians-of-biodiversity-2/), possibly forced to the river by encroachment from loggers and gold miners.\n\n4:00 Three ships off the coast. The *Susan Constant*, *Goodspeed*, and *Discovery* departed England with 105 souls in December of 1606 and made landfall along the James River on May 13, 1607. As mentioned in the previous review, the site of Jamestown was a completely inappropriate place to start a settlement, unless you planned on being an asshat and need to defend yourself against angry Powhatans.\n\n5:30 The Powhatan village sees the arrival of the English ships. The chief make-up artist for this film had lots of fun with body paint. I don’t know why the Powhatan are jumping/scurrying about in a way that makes them look kinda like confused monkeys. European traders were operating up and down the Atlantic seaboard, and several Jesuit missionaries were killed after establishing a short-lived mission near the James River in 1571. This isn’t the first time they’ve seen a ship, or white guys, for that matter.\n\n7:40 Captain Von Trapp (Captain Newport) and Professor Lupin (Wingfield) decide not to hang Ray from *In Bruges* (John Smith). Ray responds to their mercy by aimlessly wandering in the woods for roughly the next 15 minutes of the movie.\n\n12:30 Now we get to hear a little modified Algonquian, created for the film, that represents an attempt to mimic the dialect spoken by the Powhatan in the early 17th century.\n\n14:46 A Powhatan man picks up a hatchet and is promptly shot by a colonist. Captain Von Trapp, master of the obvious, states “We have lost the favor of the naturals.” That was quick.\n\n15:30 First hints the desperate food situation in Jamestown. Despite the almost constant rain in the movie, the settlers arrived at Jamestown during a particularly horrible multi-year drought. Even if they did plan well, which they didn’t, the drought was the worst in hundreds of years, and even stretched the Powhatan food supplies. In the movie it is time to send an envoy to a great king upriver in hopes of securing food. Captain Von Trapp returns to England on the first supply trip while Ray will repair his reputation by establishing a trading (please help us, we’re starving!) relationship with Powhatan.\n\n17:12 Ray leads a small party upriver while monologuing on the voices speaking within and to him. Maybe not such a good idea to send a schizophrenic as an envoy. While he is monologuing, lets discuss how few Powhatan we see in the movie even though the tidewater was called Tsenacomoco (densely inhabited land). We hardly see anyone on the shore or any signs of human habitation when the area was home to 34 allied groups and more than 14,000 inhabitants under the paramount chief Powhatan/Wahunsenaca.\n\n20:00 Alone in the swamp in armor and Ray gets his ass handed to him. He then tries to explain the basics of orienteering using a compass. The Powhatan are not impressed. A captured Ray is brought to Werowocomoco. Historically, when Smith was abducted in December 1607 Mattaponi oral tradition states he knew he would be released in four days, and he knew his life was not in danger during the werowance ceremony. Now, somehow Ray can understand Algonquian. That is nifty.\n\n25:15 Is that a live garter snake tucked behind that dude’s ear? What the why?\n\n25:43 Time to scare the shit out of Ray. Too bad Powhatan longhouses don’t work like that. Parts of the bark covering could be removed to make a window-like opening, but taking out an entire wall for the war party to rush in isn’t realistic. Also, the iconic image of Pocahontas saving Ray from certain death likely didn’t happen. See the previous review.\n\n27:25 In the movie Powhatan states, “If they do not leave, we will drive them into the sea.” Powhatan really wanted the English, inept though they might be, as partners against the emerging Spanish threat, as well as an ally against the Monacans and Susquehannocks. \n\n27:55 Ray provides our perspective into life among the Powhatan. We see the women harvesting, men practicing with bows and arrows, tobacco drying, and general low key life in Powhatan land where everyone gets along and we don’t realize there is a class system like the one Ray was bemoaning back in Jamestown. Now the fictional romance between John Smith and Pocahontas begins. Smith, dude, she is like 10 (or even 14 in real life). Stop being such a creep.\n\n30:48 Two of my favorite cameos occur during this sequence. First, a shout-out to the [Carolina Parakeet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_parakeet#mediaviewer/File:Conuropsis_carolinensis_male_Ulaval.jpg)! The species once inhabited a range from New York to Colorado and down to the Gulf Coast and Florida. Colonial accounts throughout the Eastern U.S. mention the bird, but hunting and deforestation likely led to the decline of the species. The last known Carolina Parakeet died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. One of the film’s few instances of CGI was used to create the proper coloration for the bird. Also, a cameo for [Powhatan’s Mantle](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__zzioemRey4/TF5jOYRA6wI/AAAAAAAAGCk/wZlPewahFpg/s1600/P1070751.JPG)!\n\n42:40 Even though Smith was only gone for a few days, Ray is returned to a newly constructed fort, complete with grubby kids to tell the story of Jamestown turning into *Lord of the Flies*. Ray is elected to lead. Seems natural, he is the only one not covered in shit. John Smith became the fourth leader of the colony in 1608. He did establish a “no work, no food” policy in an attempt to find a way to make the Jamestown venture profitable. He adopted the key role of trader with the Powhatan, supplying much needed food to the settlement. However, Smith was injured in a gunpowder accident in 1609 and returned to England before Starving Time. \n\n50:17 Starving Time in Jamestown and people start to go a little crazy. We see settlers boiling and eating leather belts, suicide, and cannibalism. Starving Time has Smith misplaced in time. The First and Second Supply missions by Captain Newport in 1608 added to the number of mouths to feed without providing enough supplies to sustain the inhabitants of Jamestown. Smith was injured in late 1609 and left for England before conditions deteriorated completely. His departure left little hope for food from the Powhatan since he was one of the few competent intermediaries and the Powhatan, like the English, were also struggling during an extreme drought. Archaeological investigations at Jamestown highlight how desperate the situation became. Dogs, cats, and horses show evidence of being inexpertly butchered, as do [the remains of a 14-year-old English girl](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/starving-settlers-in-jamestown-colony-resorted-to-cannibalism-46000815/?no-ist). George Percy, the president of Jamestown during Starving Time wrote about the experience in 1625 saying, “And now famin beginneinge to Looke gastely and pale in every face, that notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes out of graves and to eate them. And some have Licked upp the Bloode which hathe fallen from their weake fellowes.”\n\nRay cites the official census as 38 and the snows have yet to fall.\n\n1:03:02 In the movie the attack on Jamestown begins after the Powhatan discover maize fields planted by the English, indicating their intent to stay in Virginia. In reality, Smith had already returned to England and the relationship between the English and the Powhatan were straining. The First Powhatan War began in August 1610 when the English attacked the Paspahegh capital, abducted the queen, and killed her in Jamestown. Other Powhatan towns were burned in subsequent raids.\n\n1:09:22 Powhatan disowns and banishes Pocahontas as the Powhatan warriors uproot all the English crops. In the movie Pocahontas goes to Pastancy to her uncle Patowomeck who sells her to the English for a copper kettle. The story that Pocahontas was traded for a kettle is naturally very offensive to Powhatan descendants. Mattaponi oral tradition states Captain Argall’s men invaded Pocahontas’s home, killed her husband Kocoum, and abducted her before she had any chance to fight back. After her abduction in 1613 Mattaponi oral tradition holds she did not resist the English aggression as a means of protecting her people from retaliation if she escaped. \n\n1:18:14 Supply ships return. The Third Supply ships were stranded in Bermuda for nine months after a hurricane. They were finally able to arrive in Jamestown in May of 1610. In the movie everyone is happy with the ships’ arrival and begin offloading stores. In truth, once the re-supply ships returned the meager survivors of Starving Time boarded ship and planned to abandon the colony in favor of more profitable locations. They were intercepted by another supply run with the governor Thomas West, and returned to Jamestown. The food situation continued to stress the colony, eventually leading to hostilities in the First Powhatan War.\n\n1:23:27 Pocahontas gets a servant, then dons English clothes and high heels like a proper “good Indian”. Ray upturns a table to show how frustrated he is about leaving for England. Where is /u/PleaseRespectTables when you need him?\n\n1:30:00 In the movie Smith tells his friends to lie about his death two months after he departs. Pocahontas shows she is upset by placing ashes on her face, and generally wallowing in the mud around Jamestown. Mattaponi oral tradition states Pocahontas was very depressed during her captivity, and the time leading up to her marriage to Rolfe. When her Mattachanna and Uttamattamakin visited her in Jamestown, Pocahontas reported she was raped. Mattaponi oral history entertain the possibility that she was moved to the Henrico plantation as a means of hiding her advancing pregnancy.\n\n1:34:01 Batman (John Rolfe) sees Pocahontas give water to a man in the stocks even though she is massively depressed. He starts creepily following her around as she works, and quickly begins monologuing about her. I wonder if Malick (the director of *The New World*) tries to woo potential mates by following them around and monologuing.\n\n1:37:30 Pocahontas is baptized as Rebecca, and the movie now refers to her by that name. Mattaponi sacred oral tradition does not indicate if she truly converted, was brainwashed, or chose conversion as a means of avoiding potential conflict. Pocahontas will go help Batman and his tobacco fields, finally providing the English with a cash crop that will make this Jamestown venture a viable colony.\n\n1:43:48 After extensive silent nature walks featuring inner monologuing Batman asks Pocahontas to marry him and Captain Von Trapp presides over the wedding, which took place in early 1614. Mattaponi oral tradition does not indicate if Pocahontas really loved Rolfe. The perspective is she was a captive, not free to choose her fate, and married Rolfe because she was pregnant with an English child. The oral history is adamant that Thomas was born out of wedlock. Regardless, the wedding ushered in a period of peace between the First and Second Powhatan Wars and allowed for an opening of trade between the Powhatan and the English.\n\n1:53:52 The trip to England took place in 1616. Tomocomo, and a company of other Powhatans, accompanied the Rolfes on their journey. Tomocomo was a close acquaintance of Powhatan and was sent to both understand/spy on the English in their homeland, as well as try to renew the relationship with Smith. The story about notching a stick for every Englishman is likely true, but he is going to need a lot more sticks. \n\n1:56:56 An audience before the King and Queen, and Pocahontas is dressed to the nines. The costume for the scene is modeled after [one of the most famous portraits of Pocahontas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas#mediaviewer/File:Pocahontas_by_Simon_van_de_Passe_1616.jpg). Before her visit Smith, ever the publicist, sent a letter to King James and Queen Anne indicating Pocahontas should be treated as princess. He was not alone in trying to sell the “Pocahontas as Princess” image to the world. The Virginia Company promoted her as a daughter of “the most powerful prince of the Powhatan Empire of Virginia.” In the movie she is presented to the royals and alongside other curious creatures from the New World (a bald eagle and a raccoon). \n\n2:00:07 Ray comes calling at Batman’s house. Smith and Pocahontas did briefly meet in England. The specifics of the meeting have been lost, but Smith recorded she was upset, she obscured her face and turned away from him when they met.\n\n2:29:05 In the spring of 1617 Pocahontas and Rolfe plan to return to Virginia. While on board the ship that would take her home, Pocahontas suddenly dies. Any number of infectious diseases could have caused her rapid decline in health, though Mattaponi oral history entertains the possibility that she was poisoned. She was buried in Gravesend, England in March of 1617.\n\nThat’s it, folks. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Today the United States celebrates Father's Day, which means lots of Father's Day themed events. Today I got to listen to some sermons about fathers and how important they are, including a talk that, despite only talking about the Revolutionary War for about 10 minutes, managed to get almost everything wrong. \n\nIn talking about fathers the speaker mentioned George Washington and how great a man he was as the \"Father of the Country\". I've got no problem with that, as that's the title he was given as early as 1779, and it's just standard patriotic stuff. Then the speaker goes on \"Washington was so dedicated to the country that he gave up everything he had for it\"\n\nWell, not exactly. It's true that he was pretty broke by the end of the Revolutionary War, and that he didn't take a salary (as he felt that public service should not be paid). However he certainly didn't give up everything he had. He still had his extensive estates which would still bring him great amounts of money. He submitted receipts to Congress for refunds for amounts that were sometimes quite large. \n\nHis home didn't see any devastation, and he was still one of the wealthiest men in the country.\n\n\"George Washington was so dedicated to the country that when his son Jack wanted to join the army at the end of the war in 1776, he talked Martha into allowing it. Jack would end up dying of disease.\"\n\n* \"The end of the war in 1776?\" Really? (I'm willing to let that one slide as it was probably just the speaker getting his words mixed up.\n\n* His son Jack. George Washington didn't have any children with Martha. Martha did have some children from her previous marriage. One of these was John Parke Custis who was sometimes called \"Jacky\"\n\n* \"Jack\" would not have needed either Martha or George's permission to enlist. In 1776 John Custis was 22 years old and had ben married for two years. He did join the Continental Army as an aide-de-camp to Washington in 1781, but by that point he was 27 years old, the father of four children, and a member of the Virginia General Assembly. It was poor finances that led him to enlist, having bee nearly bankrupted by the purchase of a large estate. He would die of \"camp disease\" during the siege of Yorktown. \n\n\"James Madison was another important Father in our country. He's known as the Father of the Constitution because of his role in it. Alexander Hamilton was a man who also had great talent and skill, but because he wasn't as dedicated as Madison he would not achieve the same heights as Madison and did not support the Constitution as much. This is why he's not known as the Father of the Constitution despite his abilities.\"\n\n* Hamilton was absolutely dedicated to the idea of a Constitution. In fact his strong nationalism tended to alienate many of his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention. He was the only New York delegate to sign the Constitution.\n\n* Hamilton was one of the primary authors of *The Federalist Papers*, key writings that defended the Constitution and helped ensure it's success. That's hardly a man who was too flaky and inconsistent to be great. It's true that he missed much of the convention because of his personal affairs, but he took a very strong role after.\n\n* Hamilton was key in getting New York to ratify the Constitution where he did show up nearly every day during that convention to speak to the delegates at the New York Constitutional convention. \n\n* Hamilton was a complete bad-ass during the Revolution, playing an important role on the battle field and behind the scenes. \n\n* Madison was called the \"father of the Constitution\" within his lifetime, but he always objected. However the title didn't become a popular one until the early 1830s with the debate around the constitutionality of the doctrine of nullification and the renewed interest in Constitutional matters. Then another spike in the 1850s and 1860s.",

        "text": "So I was avoiding work at work, and I replied to a post about the 1993 missile strike President Clinton ordered on Iraq following an assassination attempt on former-President Bush. But I *thought* I was commenting on the 1991 Gulf War. I'm so ashamed. \n\nParent Comment\n&gt;The dad thing was a really stupid reason, even more so than the \"suspicion\" of WMDs. All I could think was, what makes your dad so special that avenging an attempt on his life is worth the lives of so many other people on both sides? Besides, the US already carried out a revenge operation in 1993, although not a lot of people really know about it it seems.\n\nMy ill-conceived response:\n&gt;I don't want to interrupt a circlekjerk in progress, but Desert Shield was about ejecting the Iraqi army from Kuwait. Iraq tried to annex a US ally, to whom we had military obligations. The US ran Iraq out of Kuwait and stopped short of Baghdad. Which part was about revenge? What was the US supposedly avenging?\nThere is certainly an argument to be made for the war in 1993 being about profiteering, empire-building, or any other number of things. But revenge is a stretch.\n\nOP sends a Tomahawk missile into the heart of my argument:\n&gt;Desert Shield was an operation that took place in 2006 as part of the second Iraq War. Could you be referring to Desert Storm?\nDesert Storm took place in 1990-1991. What I'm referring to is something completely different that took place in 1993.\nThe event I'm referring to was unrelated to any war and was described by President Clinton himself as a \"firm and commenserate\" response to Iraq's plan to assassinate former president George Bush. This is an old Washington Post article from 1993 about the operation in question, which involved firing 23 Tomahawk missiles at the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service where it was believed the assassination plot was conceived.\n\nAlthough he was incorrect about the terminology (Desert Storm/Shield were indeed parts of the First Gulf War), I was wrong about everything else. I shouldn't have been so hasty. \n\nLink: http://www.np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2873d9/manning_says_us_public_lied_to_about_iraq_from/ci840qp?context=3",

        "text": "Over a week ago, /u/arachnopope wrote a [pretty awesome badhistory review](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/27b3i8/300_badhistory_review/) on the movie *300*. I won't be able to do a job as good as they did, but I'll still try to explain the bad history in the sequel to 300, 300: Rise of an Empire.  \n\n00:00:35-King Xerxes did not personally come up to Leonidas’ body on the battlefield and behead it. According to Herodotus, [Xerxes had someone else behead the body and crucify it, putting the head on a stake]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_I#Battle_of_Thermopylae).  \n\n00:02:09-Queen Gorgo, as far as I can tell, was never present at the Battle of Salamis.  \n\n00:03:04-I need not remind you guys that the Athenian Hoplites were a [LOT better armoured]( http://www.military-history.org/articles/athenian-hoplite-profile.htm) than the movies portray.  \n\n00:03:27-The Persians had already disembarked, and were holding a stalemate with the Greeks for days before the Greek offensive at the [Battle of Marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_marathon).  \n\n00:03:41-Themistocles was not a “little-known Athenian soldier”. As a matter of fact, he had made [quite a name for himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistokles#Political_and_military_career) even before the battle of Marathon.  \n\nEntire dramatic sequence starting from 00:07:20-Themistokles never shot an arrow at King Darius, and King Darius did not die due to any injuries suffered during the Battle of Marathon. As a matter of fact, he died around 4 years later, in 486 BCE.  \n\n00:10:03-The entire monologue in which “Artemisia whispered the seeds of madness” probably never happened.  \n\n00:10:30-The entire “god-king” bullshit, obviously never happened either.  \n\n00:11:51-Artemisia never went on a killing spree like the one depicted in the movie. Like, seriously, how can you pull so much shit of your arse?  \n\n00:15:25-The use of Elephants by the [Persians in the Greco-Persian Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_war_elephants#Under_the_Achaemenids) is unlikely, because neither Herodotus or Xenophon ever mentioned it.  \n\n00:25:08-I’m sure you all know that the entire life history of Artemisia’s family being raped and murdered as well as Artemisia being sold as a sex slave is shitthatneverhappened.txt  \n\n00:30:22-The actual number of the Greek Ships was [371-378](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis#The_Greek_fleet), not “just over 50” as the commander reports.  \n\n00:32:27-It’s highly unlikely that the Persians used slaves to row their ships.  \n\n00:34:07-The defensive circular formation used by the Greeks would have most probably been the [Hedgehog Counter-formation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Greek_naval_and_land_tactics_in_the_5th_century_BC#Hedgehog_Counter-formation), which would have involved having the prows facing out, unlike the depiction in the movie.  \n\n00:37:43-The Athenians weren’t exactly as “untrained” at combat as the movie implies them to be; at the [age of 18](http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/the_athenian_army.html), every Athenian was required to spend [two years](http://plaza.ufl.edu/tlombard/atheducation.html) in the military.  \n\n00:43:45-The Greeks never used a barricade of ships to block the Persian navy.  \n\n00:44:05-I’m pretty sure that the Greeks understood that leaping from a great height onto wooden ships to attack their crew was a pretty bad idea, and thus never attempted it.  \n\n00:46:20-Just noticed this, but the Persians didn’t wear armour that was so flimsy it couldn’t stop a slashing sword. You’d think their armour was like a T-shirt, what with the way it has been portrayed.  \n\n00:48:53, to the end of the sex scene-Obviously never happened. I’m sure Themistocles and Artemisia never had sex.  \n\n01:01:14, entire fiery scene of carnage-Fire battles and suicide bombers? Lolwut?  \nAlso, the Persian navy didn't possess an ironclad supertanker 10x the size of any greek vessel at Salamis.(thanks to /u/Flyingsquare for reminding me.)  \n\n01:08:41-Ephialtes was never sent as a messenger to Athens with Leonidas’ sword.  \n\n01:16:08-[Artemisia was the only commander of Xerxes who advised against a naval battle.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_I_of_Caria#Preparations) The movie, however, shows Artemisia as being eager to unleash the full might of the Persian navy upon the Spartans at the battle of Salamis.  \n\n01:17:36-The Athenians and the Spartans were allied before the Battle of Salamis, and the Athenians weren’t the only ones fighting the battle at the beginning.  \n\n01:27:26 fight scene between Themistocles and Artemisia-Themistocles and Artemisia never fought face-to-face, and Artemisia did not die at the battle of Salamis.  \n\n01:30:04-Navies at the time wouldn't have entered battle with their sails open.(Thanks to /u/Theoroshia and /u/Celebreth)  \n\n01:30:10-Again, the Spartan intervention wasn’t in the nick of time; they had already allied with the Athenians before the Battle of Salamis begun.  \n\nThese are just the most obvious mistakes I could pick out. If you could think of anything I haven't mentioned here, I'd love to hear it. If I've made any mistakes as well, let me know of them and I will edit them.  \n\nEDIT-Added /u/Flyingsquare's suggestion, included a link to the original 300 Badhistory review.  \n\nEDIT 2-Fixed various minor errors in grammar and my choice of words.  \n\nEDIT 3-Incorporated the suggestion of /u/Theoroshia and /u/Celebreth as well.",

        "author": "lordhatlessman",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2869u1/in_rassassinscreed_bad_gender_history_concerning/",
        "text": "So we have [This thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/282nve/i_am_dissapointed_in_some_ac_fans_you_dont_have/)\n\nAs a brief summary: Ubisoft was on the receiving end of some criticism when people were asking why they couldn't play as a woman in the newest game, which takes place during the Reign of Terror/French Revolution. A bunch of people are now backlashing against this. Honestly, in my opinion, I think it's hollow criticism to accuse the Assassin's creed games of excluding women, since the previous game had multiple women who played prominent roles as well as having DLC where the player's character was a woman. But what we are here today to see some class A sexist badhistory: some people on /r/assassinscreed won't just settle by saying that Ubisoft simply didn't have a woman as a playable character, they decide to claim that women could not be playable characters. Let's dive in. I'll just leave a deluge of this vein of comments\n\n&gt;The life of women in 18th century France makes it unlikely they would be assassins, even Marie Antoinette had very little power. There are great possibilities for a female assassin, but the women who had the freedom to move around undetected and have had access to powerful men were few and far between. They would have most likely been an extremely wealthy widow or a courtesan/mistress. In the scheme of things it wasn't that long ago that women were property, who were \"watched\" and judged very closely by society. Which would make stealth a little bit of a challenge. \n\nand\n   \n&gt;No, I'm implying that up until the 20th century (america), women couldn't vote and had pretty much no say in anything. Think back to your history classes. when did you ever learn about a particular women until recently in history? I'm not saying it can't be done, but a protagonist that isn't a bad ass isn't going to do it for me. And when its someone who (even now in the middle east) gets ordered around and disrespected, it would be hard to do. (I'm pissed at myself for forgetting her name), but think of the girl in black flag who had to pretend to be a guy. It could be a protagonist like that, but I feel like the story would be too focused on that, and not enough on everything else.\n\n\nSo when most people think of assassinations in the French Revolution, there is really only one prominent assassination that took place. That assassination was the death of  [Jean-Paul Marat,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat) a radical journalist who fiercely advocated for human rights. One day, while he was taking a medicinal bath because he had a severe skin condition, someone came in to report to him the names of Girondins in Normandy. However, this person was actually an assassin, and Marat was stabbed with a knife through his chest, a fatal wound. This is perhaps best known from [Jacques-Louis David's famous masterpiece La Mort de Marat. ] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/La_mort_de_Marat_-_replica_-_1793_-_Chateau_de_Versailles.jpg)\nWell, we now know a bit about the most famous assassination of the French Revolution, but who was it who stabbed our good friend Marat? \n\n\nWhy, it was [Charlotte Corday!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Corday) a Girondist sympathizer, and more importantly, \n\n***A  WOMAN!!!***\n\nHow strange, these people claim that French Women wouldn't be assassins, and yet the only assassin in the French Revolution anyone cares about is a woman. Huh, it's almost like the ability to kill people is not portioned off to one sex. In fact, there was also another woman who was involved in the affairs of assassination. A woman by the name of[ Cecile Renault](http://books.google.com/books?id=lTgEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=cecile+renault&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Bl_3WG8UU&amp;sig=a2BkCYmJ4SKxnl4Ky119kctzGwU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p_mcU8r_D5CjyASq2oL4Ag&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)  was found trying to talk to Maximillien Robespierre with two small knives in her possession, and was soon guillotined for being accused of an attempted assassin. \n\nClearly, women could be assassins, and they could definitely be assassins in the French Revolution. \n\nBut some of the drama was also about there being a lack of black/ not white characters. Once again, I think AC has a pretty good track record when it comes to racial and ethnic diversity, and I don't think that these things were necessarily essential. But once again, we must use badhistory to explain why these things were!\n\nFirst, some badhistory on slavery in France! \n\n&gt;Regarding the whole \"white\" thing, we're talking about a time where racism and slavery were common, the French would not take well to any kind of ethnicities in their city. Also this is Paris, France, not a place many non-caucasian people were hanging around in the 1790s\n\nSo Claiming that slavery was common in this time period in France isn't very true. First of all, slavery was abolished on mainland France by Louis X in the 1300's. However, slavery still existed in other places the French owned. However, slavery was abolished in all French posessions in 1794. In fact, there are times when African slaves brought to France were set free simply for being in France \n\n While the only footage so far of the game takes place in 1793, it could go much further, so to assume that slavery was commonplace in France during the game's time is not really true. Perhaps at the start of the game, slavery in French possessions was accepted, but there would not have been slaves on the mainland. This is more of an innocent mistake than the first two. \n\nThe first two are really bad because they use beliefs about women's standing in society to retroactively decide that women couldn't have been certain types of people. Women could be assassins. Trying to say that women were not not only assumes women could not easily kill others, but it ignores the events of the French Revolution. It seems that to some people, defending their favorite franchise does not just require accepting the choice of characters, but deciding that gender history necessitates it. \n\n\nThat's all for now.

England has elected members of parliament who debate taxes in parliament. This is the precise opposite of taxation without representation, which is what he was claiming.

        "text": "Let me start out by saying I collect glass and porcelain insulators from old school open wire telephone and telegraph lines, and from power transmission lines.  Strike that, I don't just collect them, I have created classification and numbering systems for two different types within the hobby, have a couple hundred of the things laying around my room right now, and own several where the known units can be counted on one or two hands with fingers left over. So yeah, I'm really into the things.  So I twitched a lot while reading [this newspaper article](http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2014/06/13/victor-insulators-marker/10492243/)\n\nAnnouncing that a historical marker to note the roll of Victor Insulators (I'm looking forward to the puns off this one) in the roll of insulator production and innovation in the US, the article is chock full of the worst sort of bad history.  I'll go from the top, and cite as many online sources as possible, as the books used within the hobby are either hobby specific, or several books that circulated within the insulator industry itself, and as such not readily attainable to the layperson. \n\nFirst we have to understand that Victor Insulators is not the original company to occupy that manufacturing spot in Victor, New York. Originally the plant was built by Fred M. Locke in 1898, who was forced out of the company in 1904, which continued selling under the \"Victor\" trade name, as well as being known as Locke Insulators. Later, as Locke expanded their operations in their new Baltimore plant in the 1920's, the Victor factory was shuttered, and then sold to local businessmen, who reopened it in 1935 as the current incarnation of Victor Insulators.  So, given this, Victor Insulators, traces their history back to Fred Locke opening his plant in 1898 in Victor. All well and good.  Now for the bad history.\n\nThe newspaper article starts off by claiming Victor was the first factory of it's kind in the nation, which is hilarious because Fred Locke built the plant because he was unable to source enough production capacity for his insulator designs.\n\n&gt;He and his brother Bill are the third generation of McKees to work at the 119-year-old company that put Victor on the map in the 20th century as the first manufacturing company of its kind in the nation. Now the company's history will be accessible to everyone when Victor erects a historical marker Thursday outside the current facility.\n\n\n\n He went from being a jobber (he'd been selling insulators both in glass and porcelain made to his designs, but made by other companies since about 1893). By 1889, General Electric had sold porcelain insulators (they sold their equipment to the R. Thomas and Sons Company of East Liverpool Ohio, who went into high voltage insulators in a big way after that, and competed directly with Locke). Locke had porcelain insulators to his designs made by Electrical Porcelain and Manufacturing Company, and Imperial Porcelain prior to 1898. Neither factory was solely dedicated to high voltage insulators, as they also made low voltage insulators for house wiring, as well as porcelain light fixtures and such. So I suppose we can give a partial pass on this claim, as Locke did build the first purpose built factory dedicated solely to porcelain insulators for electrical transmission and communications.  It's a cleverly misleading claim though, as there were several companies before him making insulators for that market. \n\nNext up, the article claims Fred Locke invented porcelain insulators in 1895.\n\n&gt;The company makes porcelain insulators, invented by company founder Fred Locke in 1895. The insulators keep the electrical current in outdoor power lines from \"leaking\" into telephone poles or electrical control panels.\n\n Well then, here is a beautiful 1840's-50's telegraph insulator from the well known [Bennington Potteries](http://allinsulators.com/photos/Porcelain/U/970-999_files/stacks_image_6643.png).  Did they perhaps mean porcelain insulators for power transmission? [General Electric](http://cjow.com/archive/article.php?month=1&amp;a=01The+General+Electric+Company+Porcelain+Factory+and+the+U701.htm&amp;year=1998) was doing that by at least 1894.  I have no idea where they get their notion that Locke invented the porcelain insulator. He improved upon it, but certainly did not invent it.\n\nScrolling further down, we see the claim that Fred Locke invented the porcelain insulator repeated again.  \n\n&gt;Fred Locke was born in Honeoye Falls in 1861, and realized while working as a telegraph operator in Canandaigua in 1883 that messages were dropped during rainstorms because the electric current in overhead power lines was cut off. He then developed the porcelain insulator, which maintained a seamless current. He distributed his invention under the name Locke Insulator Manufacturing Company.\n\n\nThe origin story is otherwise largely correct. However, it wasn't until [1898](http://fredlocke.insulators.info/Victor_Factory_History/Fred_Locke_Insulator_Manufacturing.htm) that Locke was ably to really let loose and start playing around with porcelain. [Here](http://fredlocke.insulators.info/First_Insulators/First_Insulators.htm) we have a more accurate account of what got Locke into the insulator industry. \n\nTo whit, for the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle to claim that Fred Locke invented porcelain insulators, and built the first factory for porcelain insulators is piss poor research, especially since a couple of phone calls to local historical societies could have set the record straight. It looks like they relied on the sanitized public history of [Victor Insulators](http://www.victorinsulators.com/companyindex.htm) which in and of itself is bad history. Fred Locke did not develop the \"wet process\" (homogeneous clay worked and shaped, instead of low moisture granules which are molded and porous) he simply was the first to actively capitalize on it.  I suppose in the end, after over a century, marketing can take precedence over historical fact. \n\n",

        "text": "I mentioned in the recent mindless monday thread that I might do a review of this series and have since decided to go forward with it. To begin, let me say that I possess no degree in history and, like the infamous Mr. Carlin, I am more of a \"fan\" of history than a historian. However, though I may be a layman, I consider myself a very well-read layman, especially when it comes to the late republic and early principate. My readings include the primary sources (Tacitus, Dio, Seutonius etc) although, since I do not read Latin or Greek they are all contemporary translations, so if I should misinterpret anything from them do not hesitate to correct me.\n\nFinally, this review will focus more on the sequence of big events in history and how the show gets it right or wrong. I know very little about the smaller details such as their clothes or architecture. If any of you geniuses out there *cough*/u/tiako*cough* has anything to add on this front, feel free to post it and I will edit it in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**REVIEW**\n\n\n\n\n[5:30] - This has got to be one of the greatest cuts in television history. One second it's a closeup of old man Claudius and suddenly african drums guy with his topless dancers.\n\n\n[11:00] - Old Claudius, narrating, introduces us to the [imperial household](http://i.imgur.com/FKmB54G.jpg). From right to left: Octavia, Marcellus, Julia, [Tiberius and Vipsania](http://i.imgur.com/NTvXXgp.jpg) (blocked by the Greek orator), Agrippa, Augustus, and Livia. First off, *why is Agrippa so damn old?!* Agrippa was a year younger than Augustus and should be in his late 30's at this point. Also, Livia is Augustus' 3rd wife, not 2nd. Augustus had a brief never-consummated marriage prior to Scribonia. Old Claudius never introduces us to the man in front of Livia and we never see him again, but I think he must be [Maecenas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maecenas), who appears to have been cut from the show. Absent are Drusus, 2nd son of Livia, and his wife Antonia, daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia.  \n\n\n[15:30] - Agrippa plays up his rivalry with Marcellus and leaves Rome in a huff. Agrippa's reason for taking command of the east at this time aren't completely clear, but remember that by this point it was not odd at all for one half of the Augustus/Agrippa pair to be in the provences while the other held down the fort in Rome. Upon Agrippas return, for example, Augustus took off for the provinces. In any case, if Agrippa was annoyed by Augustus' affection for Marcellus, he could not have possibly felt that his position in the power structure was threatened. When Augustus fell ill and thought himself on his deathbed, full power was handed over to Agrippa while young Marcellus got absolutely nothing.  \n\n\n[18:40] Livia says Agrippa thinks that he is Augustus' successor. Augustus insists that he's too old. Agrippa had good reason to believe himself Augustus' successor, because that's exactly what he was until the day he died. And as I explained earlier, he most certainly was not \"too old\".  \n\n\n[19:25] Augustus gives Tiberius a rather cold reception. While later on there will be much bad blood between these two men, at this point they were close allies.  \n\n\n[20:30] Livia claims both Drusus and her former husband want to do away with the principate and bring back the republic. While the elder Tiberius did indeed fight on the republican side during the civil wars, causing endless hardship for his wife and infant son along the way, the notion that Drusus shared his loyalties is just absurd. Everyone still called the government of Rome a republic during the age of Augustus anyway.  \n\n\nHere Livia also tells the story of how she predicted her son would be a great man. This is something the show does really well, as the historical Livia did indeed hatch a chicken egg under her breast to read the fortune of baby Tiberius. Tiberius must have heard this story a thousand times and would be absolutely sick of it.  \n\n\n\n[26:20] Another awesome nod to actual history. Livia is reading petitions during the gladiatorial games. Augustus says not to, because his great uncle used to do the same thing and the crowd hated it. This great uncle is, of course, Julius Caesar, who really did read letters during games, much to the annoyance of the plebs.\nI assume this building is supposed to be the coliseum, which hadn't been built yet in actual history. In Augustus' day a temporary arena would have been constructed out of wood then later dismantled. The building is possibly supposed to be the Theater of Marcellus, but Marcellus had already been dead for 5 years by the time it was actually completed.  \n\n\n[37:45] Heavy implication that Livia poisoned Marcellus. Historically, Augustus bestowed no favor on Marcellus that was not also extended to Livia's sons, so Livia's motive in the first place goes right out the window. Second, Marcellus was not even in Rome when he died. It's highly unlikely that he would have been within Livia's reach, had she intended to kill him in the first place. In any case, the death of Marcellus brought no benefit to Livia or her sons. Agrippa was #2 man in Rome, as he always had been. If there were any schemes involving the succession, he would have been the first target, not young Marcellus.  \n\n\n\n[44:30] Agrippa extorts Julia's hand in marriage out of Augustus. His price for returning back to Rome. Historically, the decision was all Augustus'. Julia was all of 18 years old when Marcellus died and Augustus wanted her attached to a trusted man close to the family. The solution was Agrippa. Since Agrippa was already #2 man in Rome and official successor should anything happen to Augustus, this dynastic reshuffling would not send any mixed signals to be misinterpreted by observers regarding the succession (as Julia's marriage to Marcellus seems to have caused). Also, Augustus would get a generation of Roman ubermensch from the union, the mixing of Agrippa's genes with his own through Julia.  \n\n\n\n\n[46:00] Another nod to actual history. Augustus drops his \"fast as boiled asparagus\" line, to Livia's annoyance. According to Suetonius, Augustus did in fact invent and use this phrase in his letters.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[47:00] Old man Claudius claims Agrippa died by Livia's hand. Nonsense. Agrippa and Livia were allies, if anything, due to Tiberius' marriage to Agrippa's daughter. Regardless, Livia would not have been unhappy with the position of either of her sons by this point. Both already had their careers made along the same path by Augustus, clear successors to Agrippa if not Augustus himself. Although Augustus adopted all of Agrippa's sons by Julia, he still valued age and experience most of all. Remember that young Marcellus, beloved as he was, got nothing at all when Augustus believed himself dying. Full power had been transferred to Agrippa.  \n\n\n[47:20] \"Everyone loved [Drusus] except Livia, his mother\" old man Claudius tells us. Not true at all. I'll talk more about this one later. Also here, Drusus implies that Tiberius is retired from military life and now keeps to domestic posts in Rome. In reality, both Tiberius and Drusus were both being rotated in and out of military commands, shuffled around as their patron Augustus needed. The spa activity that they're doing here, scraping the sweat off their skin with that tool (forget the name), is historically accurate. I'm not exactly sure whats going on with Julia and Antonia though.  \n\n\n[1:02:15] Augustus complains to Drusus about the nobility not getting married and having children. A nod to real history, this was one of Augustus' greatest pet peeves. More nonsense about Drusus being a republican too.  \n\n\n[1:08:11] Poor Tiberius. Just like in the show, he never stopped pining for Vipsania. However, it was Augustus that forced the divorce, not Livia's scheming.  \n\n\n[1:10:30] Augustus is pissed that Tiberius was seen following Vipsania around in public. This actually happened, and allegedly Augustus arranged it so that Tiberius and Vipsania would never be outside at the same time ever again. That one line, though: \"I didn't ask for this marriage, you asked for it and she asked for it\". That's quite the opposite actually. Augustus was the only one pushing for the marriage between Julia and Tiberius. Unfortunately for them, Augustus' opinion was the only one that mattered. Great acting in this scene, though. Look at Livia's little eye roll when Augustus uses his \"boiled asparagus\" line again. Brilliant!  \n\n\n[1:22:55] Livia's personal physician shows up again when Drusus is on his deathbed. The implication is obvious. If Livia was going around poisoning people to advance her own dynasty, why kill one of her sons? If it was a republic vs empire thing (which it wasn't), why kill off the people who stand to benefit from the imperial system in the first place? The motive just isn't there. Not to mention the logistics of poisoning a man when he's in a military camp on the Rhine rather than at any time he was in Rome and actually within reach. Livia was devastated by the loss of her son, and I'll talk more about that below. Here we also see baby Claudius, making his first appearance not as the narrator.  \n\n\n[1:33:17] Tiberius points out Livia shed no tears for Drusus. In reality, the death of Drusus devastated Livia. She consulted with friends and philosophers about her grief and to cope she publicly displayed his portrait and encouraged people to talk about him in her presence. It seems to have worked, as Livia would remain active and alert for many years while Octavia, obsessive over the death of Marcellus, never recovered and dropped out of public life.  \n\n\n[1:34:00] Julia crosses the line and Tiberius punches her in the face and gets exiled. \n\nWell, here's how things really went down: with Drusus and Agrippa both dead, Augustus formally transferred all powers once held by Agrippa to Tiberius. This made Tiberius uncontested #2 man in Rome, and official successor should anything happen to Augustus before his beloved grandsons were old enough to hold office. With near equal power to Augustus, Tiberius finally had the authority to say \"no\", and that's exactly what he did. On the verge of taking command of a military post in the balkans, Tiberius dropped everything and announced his retirement, heading off to Rhodes and neglecting to take Julia with him. Augustus took this as a personal snub, which it probably was, and told Tiberius to stay put and not bother ever returning. Not so much an exile but more of bridges being burned. THIS is finally where the two men have a very cold relationship between them. Although the show presents this state of affairs the entire time, through most of this episode they would have been close allies and partners, especially after the death of Agrippa.  \n\n\nAnd that's all for episode 1. Not the most interesting but a lot of little nods to actual history that you might miss if you haven't read from the primary sources. Overall, I find this episode to be scattered and all over the place, squeezing decades of Augustus' reign into just over 90 minutes. The show slows down the pace considerably from here on out (it's another 3 episodes until Augustus dies!) and next time we finally get to see young Claudius enter the scene and say a few lines. Like I said earlier, if you've got anything to add post away!\n\n",

He viewed Jews as a race unto themselves, but did not do the same with Christians. He wanted a unified Protestant church and a Catholic hierarchy that accepted Nazi supremacy, but he underestimated the extent to which religious figures disagreed with his policies.\n\n&gt;When religion was on Hitler's radar at all, it was always interwoven with other issues - which is why historians don't tend to focus solely on this question. Hitler cared most about the idea of the German nation understood in racial terms, and that's what motivated his thinking the most. Suggesting that whether or not he was a Christian or an atheist even mattered just reveals the ideological bias of the speaker.\n\nEdit: I purposefully neglected addressing the idea that Hitler was pro-capitalist, as that seems like a whole new world and I don't remember BadHistory posts to fall back on. But my impression is that that's bullshit as well -- subordination of industry to the state's directives and interests hardly seems capitalist, but I'm neither an economist nor historian, so I'll leave that to them.",

        "text": "So, who's excited for Assassin's Creed Unity? Everyone, right? I mean, I need to get it because of my own Jacobin politics but if it doesn't end in the assassination of a king, then what's the point of putting it in the French Revolution? Well, I saw the E3 trailers and noticed a few things... well, quite a few things. Okay, it actually made me a little angry. I’m only angry because I love the time period more than any other subject I’ve studied in school. Note: I took screenshots from YouTube of the examples I am using and pulling from other sources I can as my scanner isn’t working. Further, pictures will be embedded into the analysis for cleanliness. Second Note: I know this is a form of entertainment and not claiming to be historically accurate, but I would like to at least inform those interested in the era. Final note: [this is the cinematic trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETQe2efMMDU) while [this is the co-op trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpVy5CPGZbE)\n\n\nThe entire thing is a mess, honestly. I will focus on three things: the events of July 14th, barricades, and uniforms. I bring attention to these three things because I’ve only seen two trailers, one trailer which focused on co-op and showed a mission and the other trailer being a cinematic trailer depicting the storming of the Bastille with help of four assassins. \n\n\nNow, the easy part; barricades. Within French history, there is an unusual attachment to the barricade. It was a part of the Fronde (an event of political-religious upheaval which resulted in the absolute power of the French King under Louis XIV) and is more famous for the various French Revolutions that happened between 1827 till the Paris Commune of 1870. Now, in the co-op trailer, [you see this here](http://i.imgur.com/QyAmIqk.jpg) a half barricade that’s similar to [the barricades seen in *Les Miserables*](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ZNDkMmx1sLg/maxresdefault.jpg). Further you can see [this mini barricade]( http://i.imgur.com/g47K7uT.jpg). [Here are some](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/La_Charte_ou_la_Mort.jpg) historical examples from [the Revolution of 1830](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Horace_Vernet-Barricade_rue_Soufflot.jpg). \n\n\nFor this, I had looked around my sources because I haven’t heard of barricades during the French Revolution. So I looked for a book I had and found *The Insurgent Barricade* by Mark Traugott, something I’d recommend on the phenomenon of the barricade in French history. According to him, “a number of historians have categorically declared that there were [no barricades]” but argues that there were because a few instances such as the future King Louis-Philippe when a customs barrier and ‘”All the approaches were barricaded off and guards placed at the gates.”’ However, I would argue that an instance of boarding up a building doesn’t equal [this barricade from the Revolution of 1848](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Prise_du_Ch%C3%A2teau_d%27eau%2C_en_1848.jpg).\t\n\n\nSo, with this I would have a hard time accepting this part of the history. The barricade, while an important part of French history, wasn’t an important thing within the French Revolution. Within other events of French history, it was very important as it helped give the citizens power over a more capable military. During THE French Revolution, the military was very quickly minimized due to a combination of pressure from the Estates General as well as the citizens being proactive in arming themselves. Further, the military was a mess compared to other time periods, with a large mercenary contingent in combination with economic recession that’s making it hard for the crown to pay anything (which is why the Estates General was assembled).\n\n\nNow, the uniforms. [This](http://i.imgur.com/YBvzEJo.jpg) is [what](http://i.imgur.com/ddacYO6.jpg) Ubisoft thinks [the uniforms look like](http://i.imgur.com/jFAUBz9.jpg). Now, the big problem is that the uniforms is the color and the cut. [This is](http://www.metaldetectingworld.com/detecting_mohawk_valley/french_militia.jpg) what a French uniform looks like, most important is the white uniform. The uniforms that you see in the trailers is similar to that of the [*Nationale Garde*](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Philippe_Lenoir_by_Horace_Vernet.jpg), now those were made in 1791 to serve as a citizen guard of France that was loyal not to the King but to France. Note the coat compared to that of the first which aren’t close to the pre-Revolutionary French army. The national guard uniforms are very similar to what would be used in the Napoleonic era, so they’re out of place. Further, while the blue uniforms were introduced by 1792, [if you look at this painting of the Battle of Valmy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Valmy_Battle_painting.jpg) you can see the infantry wearing white uniforms rather than the famous blue. The white uniforms existed, they slowly were transitioned out due to replacement of worn out. At least they got the tricorn hats correct, which existed up until the Napoleonic Era when shakoes were introduced in the first years of Napoleon’s rule.\n\n\nNow, the biggest problem of the trailers, mainly the cinematic trailer, was the storytelling. It presents a story of, what I assume is a company of soldiers by the numbers present, [creating a killing field]( http://i.imgur.com/WONnX5U.jpg) where they would shoot the citizens. Now, this creates a huge problem because there were not this many soldiers at the Bastille. The history has told us that the Bastille was simply a symbol of terror but it didn’t do more than house some malcontents, and even then they were treated humanely. Famously the Marque de Sade was housed there up until a couple of weeks before the storming, although I don’t know what happened to him afterward, and he lived in relative comfort, reading and having visitors. \n\n\nSo this symbol of feudal oppression eighty-two *invalides*, veteran soldiers that had experienced hardship or were injured, thus being unable to do much but keep duty at a cushy prison that didn’t have more than ten prisoners. In addition to these *invalides* there were recently transferred thirty two soldiers of a Swiss regiment, [which looked like this](http://weaponsandwarfare.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/xghgm-399x500.jpg). So, you had a hundred and fourteen troops in total inside the Bastille. Based on my rough counting of [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/flwTgaJ.jpg), you have at least sixty-two, and behind them is another line, so perhaps a full company of over a hundred-twenty right in front of the Bastille. Add on top of the [soldiers within the Bastille](http://i.imgur.com/WCWNPa6.jpg), you have at least a half battalion of around three hundred or so troops. \n\n\nThen there’s the order of events. You have people charging the Bastille as if directly attack it right away, you see [artillery fire](http://i.imgur.com/cPe5JJq.jpg), hitting and crashing into buildings nearby. Rather the events happened differently; generally the governor of the Bastille, Bernard-Rene de Launay, was in talks with representatives of the people to disarm the guns of the Bastille (several artillery pieces), prisoners, and any other arms that was in their possession. The people got tired of the discussions as they were taking place and rushed the courtyard, cutting the chains of the drawbridge, and storming the Bastille. Due to Launay’s interest in keeping bloodshed at a minimum, he brokered a cease fire, but it didn’t work so he just let the people take the Bastille. There was no [final stand]( http://i.imgur.com/eaPS1Bd.jpg) and eventually the people carried Launay away for a kangaroo trial. (also, that’s not how you keep gunpowder, that’s a REALLY bad way to keep it, it’ll get wet and fly away in the wind). \n\n\nIn what has been presented by Ubisoft, they have presented their version of the French Revolution. While there are small problems, such as with the barricades and the uniforms, there are problems with how it is being presented as with the events. I hope that this brings people to /r/askhistorians in the future with questions about the Revolution, it is a very complicated and complex time in history that is far from the black and white image we get.\n\n\nSo, that’s what I, as a student of Early Modern French history, saw. I hope you all enjoyed this.\n\nEdited for spacing and fixing a link.",

I've set it up so that AutoModerator will put up the megathreads (Mindless Monday/Thoughts for Thursday/Weekend Moratorium) every single week. **This means that you don't need to post them anymore.** The last couple of times, it seemed like a race on who is going to get the megathreads up first, and it wasn't going up at a specified time. It's been set to go up at 4:00 UST (which is unaffected by government imposed Daylight Saving Time/British Summer Time). Ideally it should be up at 12 AM EST. All dates have been scheduled for next week, so this Saturday will be the last time that a human puts up the Weekend Megathread. Note: voting threads for the Moratorium will still be done manually by moderators.  \n2. I've recently learned that a certain racist subreddit whose name I will not name has plans to mass advertise their subreddit. I don't want them to advertise their subreddit here; one of the comments we removed in the past week was a user who was trying to advertise said sub, and it's possible that they'll be trying it again. As such, I've put up a word filter to remove all comments naming said subreddit and stopping it in their tracks. This is the only thing that's in the word filter. I don't have plans to use it to filter out other words. \n\nI need to figure out a way to see if I can use it to check for np-links in submissions and comments; once I figure that out, I'll add that to the AutoModerator code to help with R1 enforcement.\n\nAnyways, there we go. \n\nTL;DR: You guys can stop racing to put up the Mindless Monday/Thoughts for Thursday thread now. Also racists, stop advertising your shitty subreddit in the comments.\n\n---\nEdit: grammar stuff, added some information",

        "text": "I checked out [this post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/27xj8t/ancient_carthage/) in /r/pics expecting a \"DAE salt the earth?\" jerk, only to discover the top comments set out to debunk that myth wholesale. Emboldened, I ventured deeper into the thread only to discover it widened to a discussion of early Mediterranean power players. That's where [it got weird](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/27xj8t/ancient_carthage/ci5ku8n). One user described the settlers of the Mediterranean as being from Israel, setting an antisemitic trainwreck in motion:\n\n&gt;But are they still \"Europe\"? Yes they played a huge part in the European history, but the city was in Africa and it was built by settlers from Israel/Lebanon/Syria.\n&gt;&gt;Palestine/Lebanon/Syria - FTFY\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Ya know, at this time, it WAS Israel. And will be until 75ish AD when the Romans kick the jews out and replace them with poor arabs.\n\nAnd that, my friends, brings us to the coup de grace. Emphasis mine:\n\n&gt; I don't believe in fairly tales. Most of the references to Israel existing come from the Bible. The only solid evidence for it existing in ancient times are Hebrew inscriptions that are sometimes unearthed. Hebrew is directly descended from Phoenician, the language spoken in that region at the time so no surprises they find evidence of it being there.\n\n&gt; What I find odd about it is most of the Old Testament which heavily refers to \"Israel\" was actually ripped off Babylonian and Phonecian texts. There was a disaster about 10,500 years ago which lead to the demise of a lot of civilisations living in the region and a loss of knowledge. After that period the Abrahamic tradition arises. I imagine that world would have been in chaos and **what we call the \"Jews\" were just taking advantage using the knowledge they gained as scribes as many conquerors have done through out time and then rewrote history to suit their agenda. Much like they do today.**\n\n&gt; Palestine was an autonomous state that had their independence taken by force by spurious claims to \"divine rights\". I wouldn't accept it of any other culture.\nTo put it into context for you, China has more right to occupy Tibet than the Jews have to occupy Palestine yet very few people support them.\n\nThis strange confluence of \"the Jews did it\" with a twist of \"written by some guy named Victor\" was just too much for me, so I had to share my pain with you. Default subreddits, why must you hurt me so? In accordance with R5, I think /u/GothicEmperor explains this better than I could:\n\n&gt;This misconception that Hebrew is descended from Phoenician is also bizarre. While sharing a common origin as related Canaanite languages, one's not ancestral to another. But of course, that doesn't matter to these kinds of people.\n\n&gt;The 'a disaster happened 10,500 years ago after which Jews stole history' is exceptionally stupid. Jews were hardly ever conquerors apart from maybe same very regional happenings at the time of *Solomon (but we can't have folks of this sort discussing history without a dash of presentism, because Israel now and Israel 3000 years ago are exactly the same).\n\n&gt;Not to mention the timeframe. 8500 BC is Neolithic. There's no knowledge conquering scribes could've used since writing didn't exist yet.",

        "text": "http://www.np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/27xxtd/isis_supporter_keep_say_sykes_picot_but_is_not/ci5h9si\n\nOne refrain that has been popping up recently in the wake of the ISIS takeover of Mosul is that many of Iraq’s problems are a result of the British arbitrarily drawing colonial borders. The same thing happened after 2003, and at the time (I would argue) the argument almost became gospel in the more liberally inclined parts of academia. The Daily Show had a very popular skit about this: http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/kovgs5/sir-archibald-mapsalot-iii\n\nHowever, an actual look at Ottoman provinces (Viyalets) reveals that this simply isn’t true. Here’s a look at Ottoman Vilayets in the 1800s, compared with modern borders: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Mosul_Vilayet%2C_Ottoman_Anatolia_%281914%29.png . As you can see, the borders actually match up pretty well: Iraq’s borders match up with that of the 3 vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra. The only arbitrary modern borders are the ones drawn in the largely empty desert, so empty that the Ottomans never bothered to extend their control over the area. In fact, in the heavily populated north, the Ottoman border between Mosul and the province above it (Van) looks far more arbitrary than the one later drawn by western colonial powers. \nFurthermore, although the three provinces look separate on the map, they were largely administered together. After the initial Ottoman conquest of the region they were administered together as one large “Baghdad” province. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the region of Mesopotamia came under the control of a Mamluk dynasty, which ruled as autonomous vassals: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk_dynasty_of_Iraq . They ruled the three provinces together as one. Even after the reassertion of Ottoman authority of the region and the reformation into three separate provinces, the region was still largely ruled as a single area. For example, here’s a 1855 US State Department map that shows that the Ottomans and others considered the area as part of a single region, interconnected economically through the dominant feature of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/1855_Colton_Map_of_Turkey,_Iraq,_and_Syria_-_Geographicus_-_TurkeyIraq-colton-1855.jpg\n\nAdmittedly, the comment I initially linked isn’t the worst offender I’ve seen, but I’ve seen this inaccuracy so much in the past couple of days that I couldn’t resist making a post, and I needed something to soapbox off of.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, here’s an Atlantic article that deals with the topic as well: http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/stop-blaming-colonial-borders-for-the-middle-easts-problems/279561/\n\nI'm not trying to discredit the terrible influence that imperialism had on Africa and the middle east, nor am I trying to downplay the effects of colonial border drawing where it did happen, often with an intent to separate, divide, and dispower groups of people. However, the Middle East largely wasn't affected by this, and Iraq in particular was not.",

        "text": "I came across [this link](http://akaimpcnetwork.ning.com/profiles/blogs/melanated-cosmic-afronauts-the) via a blog that was posted to TiA. It's a downright manifesto of Afrocentrist revisionism, with enough badhistory to fill 5 posts. I'll begin, and probably won't be able to get around to all, or even most, of the errors. There are all sorts of great errors--false etymology, historical misconceptions, treating myth as fact, uncritical use of sources, etc. I'll try to stick to the ones I can do a solid Rule 5 on:\n\n&gt;If this pre-released abridged version is not at your local African bookstore, because the \nneed is critical, it may be copied and distributed — especially to those you care about — to \nhelp them wake up! Have at least 10 copies made doubleside if possible and give (or sell) \nto 10 people. If 100 people did this and their 10-friends each did the same and so on for \njust 5 generations, there will TEN MILLION people exposed to this vital information that \ncan make a vital difference! (100x10 = 1,000x10 = 10,000x10 = 100,000x10 = \n1,000,000x10 = 10,000,000!) ...A great place to make your copies is Kinko's Copies — so named after the \nkinky hair of the Lebanese founder! \n\nSo already, we open up like a chain email. Will I die in 5 days if I don't pass this on? The part about Kinko's is great, too; the founder is pretty damn far from being black--it was named, according to wikipedia, after his curly *red* hair--but I digress.\n\n&gt;You probably already know that Christ was a Black man\n\n\nI DO?!? That's news to me. Yes, I get that he isn't white like the typical depictions, but he wasn't black either. He presumably would have looked like other Galilean Jews, and would have looked very middle eastern.\n\n&gt;black paintings and statues of Christ, the Madonna, Apostles and Biblical characters still survive from early Christian \nworship\n\nSo, this likely is referring to the Black Madonnas, which were a *Medieval* depiction. There are all sorts of theories about these, including a fringe theory that they're connected to some pagan earth goddess, but IMO they're related to Song of Songs 1:4: *nigra sum, sed formosa.*\n\n&gt;Like Christ, ALL founders of world religions on ALL continents were BLACK and \"woolly\" haired, including the earliest gods.\n\nThat's a pretty bold claim, considering that there are hundreds or thousands of world religions, and some of their founders wouldn't have ever seen black people. Are we to expect that the founders of Finnish polytheism were black?\n\n&gt;Tyr of Scandinavia\n\nYup, Tyr was an actual person, and he was black, not Scandinavian and pale. Note the lack of sources.\n\n&gt;In fact, many ancient Mexican gods are portrayed jet black with Africoid features.\n\nTIL Africans invented the Mexican religion.\n\n&gt;Hair is really antennae which can receive and transmit energy! \n\nNow we're into BadPhysics territory, but I couldn't pass this one up. My source on this being BS: I have pretty long hair, and still don't get radio signals\n\n&gt;The word Egypt is derived from the Greek word Aigyptos (or Aiguptos) which means Black!\n\nThis one is false. I had to look this one up, but apparently the Greek word actually comes from [an Egyptian word](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Egypt) meaning \"temple of the soul of Ptah.\"\n\n&gt;Whites blew off the Africoid nose of the Sphinx!\n\nSo either they're repeating the BadHistory that Napoleon destroyed the nose of the Sphinx, despite that a 15th century account says the nose was already missing, or they're calling Arabs white, when they had previously called them black.\n\n&gt;The willful and systematic destruction of Africoid art has also occurred in the Americas, \nAsia and India\n\nLet's think about this a second:\n\n&gt;Africoid\n\n&gt;The Americas, Asia, and India\n\nhmmm...\n\n&gt;Inscriptions and hieroglyphics are defaced or bleached, noses are shot off or chiseled down, confusing nomenclatures are pasted over the evidence, photos are taken from misleading angles or filters, and some evidence is outright destroyed.\n\nThere's no possible way that this could be the result of time, is there?\n\n&gt;Western (white) civilization is founded upon the ancient Greek civilization which seemed to suddenly appear\n\nIt did? What about those 1000 or so years between the Classical Period and the earliest Mycenaeans? Don't even start with the Helladic Period. Apparently centuries of development is \"sudden.\"\n\nNow, the part following this is long, and I won't quote it, but the gist of it is that it's taken from Black Athena, and argues that Greek civilization was based on black Egyptian civilization. There are numerous issues with this, which I'll briefly summarize below:\n\n1) first, the identification of Egyptians as black is highly controversial. I don't really want to open this can of worms, though.\n\n2) Black Athena is heavily based on Herodotus, who mistranslated a ton of his sources, and tried to shoehorn aspects of Egyptian culture into familiar paradigms. The reason Egyptian culture seems like Greek culture in Herodotus is that Herodotus actively tried to make things correspond. Now that we can read the Egyptian sources on our own, we've begun to prove a lot of Herodotus' ideas on Egyptian culture wrong.\n\n&gt;Egypt was the greatest educational center in the ancient world. Black Egyptians educated the Greeks. Black Egyptian priests taught the best minds of Europe; Plato, Thales, Aristotle, Democritus, Anaximander, Solon and others.\n\nThis one really gets to me. Alexandria was fairly separate from the rest of Egypt. The reason it was a major location for education was because it was established by the Greeks. Of the thinkers listed, only a few have traveled to Egypt. Anaximander and Thales were from Ionia, and could have traveled there, but we have no sources. Democritus and Solon spent time in Egypt, so that's legit. Plato may have visited Egypt; some ancient sources suggest this. However, Egypt didn't influence Plato much--his largest influence was Socrates. Furthermore, he spent a lot of time in Syracuse--should we say Sicily was actually the birthplace of philosophy? Only if it's a part of an offer we can't refuse. Aristotle likely didn't go to Egypt. For more, [here's a great article by Donald Kagan](http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Stealing-history-3624) debunking a lot of these claims.\n\n&gt;A surviving sculpture of Socrates shows that he was an African,\n\nSocrates was an Athenian citizen. Athens was notoriously stingy about granting citizenship; both his parents would have to have been citizens, and their parents, and so on for generations. This claim is baseless and absurd.\n\n&gt;The Aeneid, like the Illiad, Odyssey and all the other great epics of the world, is \na poetic story dealing with Black people! Aeneas, the Trojan hero of Virgil's Aeneid, was \nin direct descent from Dardanus, the African founder of Troy.\n\nWhat is it with Afrocentrists and trusting myths? They believe every myth *must* be accurate. I've seen similar logic applied to say that Ireland was populated from Africa.\n\n&gt;The original Biblical Jews were a Black African people. \n\nNow we're into Nation of Islam territory. The original Jews were Jews, plain and simple. And if all these black people lived throughout the middle east, where are they now?\n\n&gt;The word Semite is from semi which means half. Half what? Half BLACK! (mulatto!) Semite refers to the descendants of Shem, one of Noah's sons. The word originates from the Latin prefix semi which means half, \"half Black and half white... therefore Black (since Black is genetically dominant)\"\n\nThe name comes from Shem, as they say. Shem and the Hebrew Bible long predate Latin. And the idea of thinking of someone as mixed-race is very modern.\n\nThere's also a bunch of Gypsy-related bad history. They treat the name as if it were fact, when actually we know the Roma came from India now. They also call them Semites, which is inaccurate.\n\nFinally, since I'm running out of space and patience (and whiskey), here's the last, most egregious one I'll address:\n\n&gt;African Americans are largely descendants of the original Black Jews! The original Biblical Jews were Black African people who were ruthlessly persecuted by the white man (Romans).\n\n1) Israelite Jews weren't black.\n\n2) ~~The Romans were actually fairly tame compared to all of the other persecutors of Jews in history. There's no evidence of a mass exodus (pun intended) of Jews to escape the Romans~~. (EDIT: Apparently there is some evidence of Jews fleeing after the destruction of the Second Temple, and \"tame\" wasn't a good word choice) And the greatest persecutors of the Jews in antiquity were the Babylonians, whom this article called black.\n\n3) Even if the Jews had fled into Africa, they wouldn't have arrived into West Africa, where the slaves came from. Finally, the claim that Jews fled into Africa from Josephus would mean they fled into Egypt, which was right next door. There wouldn't have been any reason to attempt crossing the Sahara; they couldn't have survived the crossing.\n\nAnd finally, some bonus anti-semitic propaganda:\n\n&gt;If the original Jews were Black, where did white Jews come from? There are two main \ntypes of white Jews; the Edomites and the Khazars\n\n&gt;...Counterfeit Jews: the hated, white \"Khazars\" who have usurped the real Jews! ... Historians are now recognizing that the majority of eastern so-called \"Jews\" are actually \"Khazars\" and have NO Semitic roots whatsoever! \n\n&gt; ...using the corrupted form of Judaism to hide behind while continuing their \ntreachery right into modern times.\n\nNothing like putting together a bunch of anti-semitic tropes all in one place",

Religion, families (all kids were taken away from their families and put in to huge foster homes in the early USSR until it was discovered to have.... issues), the place of men as the head of households, really everything.\n\nI'm going to go through these one at a time.\n\n&gt;Religion\n\nI think this is the only part here that is correct. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Soviet_Union\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR_anti-religious_campaign_(1928%E2%80%9341)\n\nhttp://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/anti.html\n\n&gt;Family\n\nThe main problem here, is that the post talks of the fact that \"all kids were taken away from their families and put in to huge foster homes in the early USSR until it was discovered to have.... issues.\" First off, there is little that can be found that would substantiate this claim. Unless our offending user here was referring to the orphaned/abandoned children of the early Soviet Union or [children of the political enemies who were prosecuted and executed in the 1930s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphans_in_the_Soviet_Union#Children_of_.22enemies_of_the_people.22.2C_1937.E2.80.931945) . In that case, that would make the wording of the post and the claim itself to be inaccurate. The post itself implies that EVERY SINGLE child in the Soviet Union was systematically moved from their families and placed in \"huge foster homes\", in a way that was literally Hitler, which, given a very [quick Google search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_in_the_Soviet_Union) , can reveal the bullshit behind the claim. (I know /r/badhistory hates Wikipedia, but the links do show how a simple search can invite one to question presupposed claims)\n\nI would reconsider my claims if the user gave a good source on this claim. Unfortunately, when questioned for a peer reviewed source, all he could provide was The Character of Nations, by Angelo Codevilla. Now I have never read or heard about this book before, but a quick Google search reveals that this is a book on international relations and is probably the complete opposite of a \"peer reviewed source.\" Using this book itself as a source is badhistory in itself. For one, the description of the book is, \"How Politics Makes and Breaks Prosperity, Family, and Civility.\" Even the title reveals to us that it can be subject to serious confirmation bias. Also, I didn't know that International Relations professors were a reputable source for family life in the early Soviet Union. \n\n&gt;The place of men as the head of households\n\nI'm going to skip this as I'm feeling a bit lazy, and my time is a bit short\n\n&gt;Really everything\n\n\"Everything\" is a statement I hate seeing in any history textbook. It's a bald and lazy word that places way too many assumptions and way too many simplifications on a problem or event that was more complex that one would think. \n\n[Also, I didn't know that the provision of a health care system and increase in women's rights indicated shutting down of those who had power.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin#Social_services)\n\nJust to show how you can't use the word \"everything\".\n\n\nAnyway, first post. I apologize if it was not up to par with some of the posts of our veteran badhistory sleuths. ",

Though the West was eventually won over to a more cosmopolitan attitude toward sex and sexuality, in the 1920s and 30s when Jews first started making their cultural influence felt among host-populations, they earned a lot of contempt from red-blooded, thorough-going Christians in Western Europe and America.\"\n\n\n\nFirst off, we all know that Europeans didn't just start hating Jews in the 1920's. I don't think I really need supporting links for the claim that Jews were not the most well liked/best treated people in Europe before the 1920's. Secondly, to say the West was \"won over\" by some cosmopolitan attitude about sex requires 10,000 bad assumptions on sexuality pre-1920 and post 1930's, and negates that sex was [increasingly censored in the West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code), while [plenty of homosexuals participated in the Nazi Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm), and they promoted all sorts of [\"non-traditional\" sex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn) to boost their population. And of course, it was the fear of homosexuality, not the economic collapse and war reparations forced on Germany after WW1, that drove 9/10 of Germans to support the Nazis. Because as we all know, [9/10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_March_1933) of Germans were \"literally\" Nazis, even though Hitler was just a misunderstood guy.

I'm pulling the actual sources this article claims to reference as I go, so any corrections or additions are welcome. Here we go.\n\n&gt; Ephorus (c. 405BC) claimed that the Celts were Blacks or Ethiopians\n\nI'm not entirely sure why the article cites a secondary source rather than the source itself, when it's readily available on the internet. But, Ephorus makes a point to differentiate between Celts and Ethiopians. \n\n&gt; The Indians inhabit the east and the country towards the rising sun; while the Ethiopians dwell towards the south; to the west the land is held by the Celts; and \nthe north is peopled by the Scythians.\n\nAs we can see, Ephorus considered the Celts and the Ethiopians to be a separate people. \n\n&gt; The Celts continued to be recognized as Blacks by Tacitus, who wrote about the Black Celts and Picts in 80 AD .\n\nThe source in the article is a book called *Sex and Race, v. 1\" by J. A. Rodgers. [Here](https://archive.org/stream/sexAndRacevol.1/SexAndRaceVol.1#page/n109/mode/2up) we can see the cited passage. However, it cuts Tacitus short:\n\n&gt; The dark complexion of the Silures, their usually curly hair, and the fact that Spain is the opposite shore to them, are an **evidence that Iberians of a former date crossed over and occupied these parts.**\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nTacitus would have been familiar with both Iberians and some Sub-Saharan Africans. If they looked like Africans, he would have described them thusly. He did not. The article in question even makes the differentiation itself:\n\n&gt; The Iberians were probably conquered by the Ligurians.\n\nThis tale comes from Thucydides, and he is pretty specific that the conquered people were Sicani. I suppose it's possible these people could have been black, but there is no evidence of it that I know of.\n\n&gt; This is supported by the Ivory Lady of York ,England. The reconstruction of the face of the Ivory Bangle Lady (c.350AD) indicates that she was African or Black.\n\nThe most recent information (2010) about the Ivory Lady that I could find makes no mention of any possible sub-Saharan ethnicity. Mediterranean, Berber, Phoenician... \n\n&gt; The original Danes or Vikings were Blacks .\n\nNo they weren't. There are plenty of medieval depictions of vikings, and they're quite pale. I haven't been able to find anything from the 8th-century specifically, but unless something pretty cataclysmic happened in a couple generations, the Danes were what we would think of as \"white\". \n\n&gt; This is made clear in the Oseberg 8th Century Vikings on the Norway Sledge carving of the Black seafarers that populated the region at this time.\n\nI'm really not sure [how](http://imgur.com/XNb3PGR) but, regardless, the sled aparrently dates to the late 9th century.\n\nPersonally, I think what we have here is some people inferring way too much based on passing historical mentions of various peoples being \"black\", when that phrasing wouldn't be used to describe sub-Saharan Africans until much, much later. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the sources are decades (if not over a century) old.\n\nFor those of you wishing to find more bad history, the comments are a gold mine. \n\n\n",

He seems to have a very poor grasp on what constitutes 'right' as opposed to 'left', and thinks 'Democrats' founded the KKK...even though the name he's taken is that of the first Grand Wizard of the KKK. Anyway...\n\nThis is bad history because the NRA was not founded for this purpose. We know this because, in addition to not being supported by evidence, even the NRA don't try to take hold of this bogus claim. I take the following from the NRA's brief history of their organization, as provided on their website:\n\n&gt;Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to \"promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,\" according to a magazine editorial written by Church.\n\n&gt;After being granted a charter by the state of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. Senator, became the fledgling NRA's first president.\n\nThe NRA as we know it today, as a political lobby as well as an organization of members sharing a common interest and political goal, does not begin to form until the first passage of restrictive legislation on firearms (National Firearms Act), in 1934, with the formation of its Legislative Affairs Division. The founding of its Institute for Legislative Action dates to 1975, and begins to take on the defense of the second amendment, as its most widely-known political agenda is today, shortly thereafter. \n\nEarly NRA activities and central locations were confined to the North, which furthermore suggests that promoting free slaves' self-defense would not have been a major issue in the Reconstruction period, as NBF states it was, although ease of furthering their efforts did cause them to move their headquarters to Washington shortly after the turn of the century. Once more from their website:\n\n&gt;An important facet of the NRA's creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York state, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held.\n\n&gt;Political opposition to the promotion of marksmanship in New York forced the NRA to find a new home for its range. In 1892, Creedmoor was deeded back to the state and NRA's matches moved to Sea Girt, New Jersey.\n\n&gt;The NRA's interest in promoting the shooting sports among America's youth began in 1903 when NRA Secretary Albert S. Jones urged the establishment of rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities and military academies. By 1906, NRA's youth program was in full swing with more than 200 boys competing in matches at Sea Girt that summer. Today, youth programs are still a cornerstone of the NRA, with more than one million youth participating in NRA shooting sports events and affiliated programs with groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, the American Legion, U.S. Jaycees and others.\n\n&gt;Due to the overwhelming growth of NRA's shooting programs, a new range was needed. Gen. Ammon B. Crichfield, Adjutant General of Ohio, had begun construction of a new shooting facility on the shores of Lake Erie, 45 miles east of Toledo, Ohio. Camp Perry became the home of the annual National Matches, which have been the benchmark for excellence in marksmanship ever since. With nearly 6,000 people competing annually in pistol, smallbore and highpower events, the National Matches are one of the biggest sporting events held in the country today.\n\nAt no point in this brief history do they make reference to this spectacular tale of standing for the rights of the freed slaves to defend themselves and their families from embittered white southerners.",

But specifically they won them because Germany was \"bankrupt\". Not that it was the depression and lot of countries had problems. But that would not do it for me. With that it is just stupid comparisons. No, we then get this gem: \n\n&gt;\"Over the next several years, every time a program began to fall apart, Mr. Hitler's party was very, very good at dividing Germany by pointing to this group or that group,\" he added. \"First they went after their political opponents. Then they went after the aristocrats. Then they went after the trade unionists. And ultimately of course they went after the Jews. They deprived them of their property, their rights, their citizenship, and for millions their humanity. Because they were bankrupt!\"\n\nNow notice, the Nazis did not go after people until after programs fell apart. And the Jews were way down on the list. \n\nNow to be clear, the Nazis were using violence against their political opponents years before they got into power. And they were targeting the Jews before they got into power. While certainly the economy played a role a lot of the Nazis support was *because* they were antisemitic and racist, not despite it.\n\n",

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/27mbvt/wwii_hitlers_invasion_of_russia/\n\nWe start of by going into full on [Icebreaker mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebreaker_\\(Suvorov\\)) with this lovely comment\n\n&gt; I believe the standing (most currently supported) opinion is that Hitler attacked Russia well after Russian forces began to mass on the Russian-German border in occupied Poland\n\nYeah this isn't anywhere close to the common or most supported position. Allow me to quote /u/turtleeatingalderman on the matter since they explained it far better than I could:\n\n&gt; The main proponent of the argument surrounding the 1941 invasion, or at least the original proponent, was Viktor Suvorov (pseudonym of Vladimir Rezun), a defector to the UK and, as I recall, a former intelligence agent for the Red Army. His thesis was initially published in his book Icebreaker: Who Started the Second World War? (1987). Essentially, he argued that Stalin had been mobilizing in \"a Machiavellian plan\" to defeat Germany and extend communist revolution to the rest of Europe, using Hitler as \"an icebreaker\" for such a scheme. Included in this are several propositions: (a) The Soviet Union had been making extensive military preparations to strengthen the Red Army through the 1930s through summer of 1941 (interrupted, of course, by Op. Barbarossa), (b) instability in the Soviet Union made the instigation of world revolution (catalyzed by Europe) necessary for its own survival, (c) that the Red Army troops mobilized en masse on the border were only prepared for offensive maneuvering, (d) Stalin, after collaborating with Weimar Germany to help circumvent certain provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, actually made efforts between 1931 and 1933 to assist Hitler's rise to power, knowing his rash behavior and predictability would make him the ideal candidate to give cause to the Soviet Union to \"liberate\" European countries from fascist rule, and (e) the war would have ended much earlier if this had occurred.\n\n\n&gt; Point (a) simply isn’t disputed, though accounts of Stalin’s introduction of a reduced age of conscription in 1939, as Suvurov claims, has been proven to be false. In reference to point (b), there is some credibility to this thinking, as Stalin had publicly declared it (Pravda, February 14, 1938, cited from V. Suvorov Last Republic, ACT, 1997), but the connection to the supposed 1941 invasion is, to the best of my knowledge, unsourced. Point (d) retains some validity, though seems to be largely speculation. According to the Treaty of Rapallo, Russia did actually make provisions for German military testing on Russian soil, but, having been signed in 1922, its connection to Stalin is a rather weak one. Of course, this continued under Stalin, coming to an end with the rise of Hitler in 1933. Richard Pipes makes the other assertions (Communism: A History, New York, 2001, pp. 74-75). Robin Edmonds points out that proposition (c) indicates simply that the Red Army planning staff \"would not have been doing its job if it had not devoted some time between 1939 and 1941 to the possibility...of a preemptive strike against the Wehrmacht\" (review of Icebreaker, found in International Affairs, Vol. 66, No. 4. Oct. 1990. p. 812).\n\nMoving on we get to this choice quote \n\n&gt;  It was a bad move to invade during the harsh Russian winter, as others have pointed out\n\nCan this myth that Hitler and Napoleon invaded during the Russian winter die a horrible, horrible death from frostbite? \n\n&gt; Arguably, he didn't have a choice but to delay because of the Yugoslav uprising. In a similar vein, it could be said that we owe the Yugoslav's for Hitler's ultimate defeat. Had they not revolted and then suffered horribly for doing so the invasion of Soviet Russia would have gone forward on time and may have succeeded.\n\nThe Balkan campaign didn't delay Barbarossa by a single day. The Balkan campaign was in fact an amazing achievement, completed far quicker than any of the Nazi's military thinkers or high command thought possible. Hitler had always been over eager and had a tendency to place invasion dates way too early. Hitler had told his generals he wanted to invade France the same year that Poland fell and had to be talked into placing the invasion date back into 1940. Barbarossa's date was no exception; the original date of May 15, 1941 was way too optimistic and didn't take into account that the thawing of Russia's winter had turned the roads into muddy tank traps, and the rivers were overflowing. The German's were also having logistical trouble moving their men into position and building the necessary air bases in Poland\n\nMoving even further into this hellish nightmare of a comments section, we get to this:\n\n&gt;  Clearly you did not read the book. There is one (1) sentence in it about going East. The one you are referring to. The rest of the book is about France being the eternal enemy of the \"German people.\"\nHitler attacked the USSR, because Stalin was preparing to attack him. This is why Stalin's army was right on the border and the Germans were able to annihilate so much of it. It is also why a lot of Russian defensive structures were unoccupied or dismantled. (The plans to build the next line of such structures included building them deep into what was then German territory, because the plan was to conquer it by then.)\n\nNo guys Hitler totes had to invade Russia, Russia literally had trillions of men on the border. There were so many Russians on the border, Putin held a rigged referendum to annex the area.\n\n&gt; There is one (1) sentence in it about going East. The one you are referring to. The rest of the book is about France being the eternal enemy of the \"German people\n\nLets see if this is true, shall we? All quotes from Mein Kampf\n\n&gt; But when we speak of new territory in Europe to-day we must principally\nthink of Russia and the border States subject to her\n\nOne.\n\n&gt; Destiny itself seems to wish to point out the way for us here\n\nTwo. Can we go for the threepeat?\n\n&gt; we put an\nend to the perpetual Germanic march towards the South and West of Europe\nand turn our eyes towards the lands of the East\n\nHitler was no fan of the French, but his entire goal, his lifelong dream was to conquer lands in the East. That was the whole point of invading Russia, land and resources.\n",

        "text": "Addressing the Pocahontas story dives into the creation myth of the United States. As with all creation myths fact and fiction blend into a narrative embedded in the public consciousness that fundamentally influences how we view our history. The Pocahontas story has been modified, amended, re-interpreted, and debunked countless times in the course of 400 years to suit the needs of the authors and the time. My dissection and discussion of the Pocahontas mythology will be spread over two reviews; this review of Disney’s Pocahontas will introduce the narrative, and a forthcoming review of Malick’s The New World (2005) will address the later portion of the story. I will review the movie based on what we know from English accounts and Mattaponi oral tradition. When possible, I will address what aspects of the myth were added by later sources. I tend to aim for ~2,000 words with these posts so this is not an exhaustive review. Please add more information and discuss further. Forgive me for any rants against common tropes of Native Americans on film. As a caveat to this post, I am not primarily a Powhatan or Jamestown historian and there are reams of published material on this topic. Please identify any mistakes so I can learn from my errors. /u/Reedstilt specifically can school me in this area, and I’ve learned so much from his posts.\n\nOne quick note… Disney did not attempt to accurately depict history with this film, and their stated goals were to depict people of different backgrounds learning to live together. However, we badhistorians know the influence movies have on the perception of the past.\n\n**Now to the movie…**\n\n1:00 For glory, God, and gold and the Virginia Company! Three ships, not the singular one seen in the film, departed England in late 1606. A line of young males sign up to head to the New World. The majority will die within a year of arriving in Virginia.\n\n1:06 [John Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_%28explorer%29#mediaviewer/File:John_Smith_after_Simon_De_Passe.jpg), the most interesting man in the world. The movie alludes to Smith’s previous experience in the New World. In New England Smith’s bushy red hair and beard made quite a sight to Tisquantum and the Patuxet while he was puttering along the New England coast fishing and bartering for furs. He returned from this voyage, shamelessly self-promoted his adventures and provided a map for future exploration of the Massachusetts coast. Plymouth colonists would use that map to direct their travels, and eventually found the colony in 1621. In the movie he is voiced by Mel Gibson (pre-crazy person mode).\n\n1:39 I like the rat climbing the lines to get on the ship. Good reminder that not all aspects of the Columbian Exchange were intentional.\n\n3:27 Establishing John Smith as a hero and man of action. Isn’t he dreamy? The real John Smith would be pleased. Also, the real voyage was difficult, and took five months to cross the Atlantic, with a brief stop in Puerto Rico.\n\n5:48 Our first glimpse of the New World, to the accompaniment of beating drums. Why do Hollywood Indians always mean drums?\n\n6:50 Wow, so many things in this opening montage I don’t know where to begin. First, I didn’t know tidewater Virginia featured so many dramatic cliffs. Second, how the hell is an armed male able to run through a herd of deer so near Powhatan settlements? Coastal Virginia was known as Tsenacomoco (densely inhabited land) and the Powhatan were certainly not vegetarians. Those deer would be dinner, and their hides would be used for clothing tribute for upper and middle class Powhatans. To compensate for overhunting along the coast the Powhatan shifted their hunts further west, away from the densely inhabited coast, but closer to their enemies.\n\nAnywho, the song references squash, corn and beans while we see women working the fields and men fishing (because hunting those deer would make them seem mean, I guess). Most /r/badhistory readers know this, but I like to mention that not all Native Americans were hunter-gatherers. In the Eastern Woodlands sunflower, squash, marsh elder, chenopod, sumpweed and goosefoot were domesticated between 2000 and 1000 B.C. Between 500 and 800 AD corn began to spread up from Mexico and through the Eastern Woodlands. Cultivation of corn, squash, beans, and other plants, combined with hunting white-tailed deer and fishing, allowed for a population increase in the Eastern U.S. Fieldwork did tend to be women’s work in Powhatan society while men hunted larger game. I dislike the implication in the song that Native Americans “try to live in balance all our days.” This oft-repeated trope of one-ness with the earth conceals the fact that Native Americans dramatically changed the landscape to suit their needs. The New World wasn’t a pristine Eden, but had been transformed by human habitation for thousands of years.\n\n7:18 The men return from a raid. The onscreen depiction seems to indicate the tidewater was sparsely inhabited with this village as an island of humanity in the happy forest. We only see one Powhatan village throughout the entire movie even though the chiefdom included over thirty allied groups. As previously stated, the tidewater was heavily populated, and instead of one village of roughly 100 people as depicted in the movie more than ten thousand Powhatan would be in the area surrounding Jamestown.\n\n8:14 Matoaka/Pocahontas was born in 1595 or 1596, the daughter of Wahunsenaca/Powhatan, a mamanatowick (paramount chief) of an Algonquian-speaking confederacy of thirty-four groups in Virginia. She would have been roughly ten years old when Jamestown was established. The name Pocahontas was a nickname meaning “naughty one” or “spoiled child”. \n\nThe one shoulder, form-fitting, short dress with a high thigh seam is a Disney-fied take on period-appropriate clothing for a Powhatan adults. Off topic, but why does Disney sexualize heroines? Pocahontas, as daughter of the paramount chief, would have access to the finest deer-skin apparel while lower class Powhatan would wear woven hemp. Men and women could wear a [topless](http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume2/images/debry_indian_large.jpg) or one shoulder covered style like [this modern interpretation]( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbs.org%2Fwgbh%2Fnova%2Fpocahontas%2Fprod-03.html&amp;h=0&amp;w=0&amp;tbnid=pbR6lgPQfOyhHM&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnh=229&amp;tbnw=220&amp;docid=BNgoixIyyFT3NM&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=zXmUU-u4N-3IsASai4DABA&amp;ved=0CAUQsCUoAQ) of dress.\n\n8:15 Hummingbirds and raccoons were not domesticated, unfortunately. \n\n8:20 And here completes our introduction to Pocahontas Protectress of the English, Angel of Purity, the Boasted Beauty of the Wilderness, and Inventor of Cliff Diving. \n\n10:00 Introducing Kocoum. Mattaponi oral tradition states Pocahontas was married to Kocoum, a Patawomeck werowance, but his only mention in English documents is from 1616 where he was said to be married to Pocahontas. There appears to be some debate on his existence. Perhaps you guys know more of the story. \n\n10:52 We see Powhatan’s house for the first time. The exact construction is a little difficult to determine, though inside it does seem quite roomy. Commoners would have smaller, dome-like homes covered in mats. Wealthier Powhatans, like the paramount chief, would have a bit more of a [long-house style design](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Powhatan_john_smith_map.jpg) covered with bark.\n\n14:30 Raccoon, otters, deer, rabbit, and beaver all happily living so close to a major settlement. Again, the Powhatan were not vegetarians, they needed protein, and the high population density in the tidewater would have stressed prey populations through overhunting.\n\n15:00 That appears to be a weeping willow, native to northern China, and introduced to the New World in the years after contact. It would not have been available to provide sage advice to Pocahontas in 1607. \n\n23:00 Jamestown was founded on May 13, 1607. Though Jamestown is sometimes portrayed as first contact in the public consciousness, European interaction with the inhabitants of the Virginia coast began soon after the discovery of the New World. Traders and slaving raids along the Florida coast preceded officially sanctioned entradas in the early 16th century, and Europeans gradually moved further north along the Atlantic Coast. Mattaponi oral tradition indicates a young Powhatan boarded a ship bound for Spain in 1559 or 1560, and returned home roughly a decade later. An unsuccessful Spanish attempt to found Dominican missions on Chesapeake Bay found themselves lost along the Virginia coast in 1566. In 1570 a small party of Jesuits, armed with an Algonquian interpreter captured during the first voyage, sailed into the mouth of the James River, five miles from the future site of Jamestown. The Jesuits crossed to the York River where they established a small wooden mission close to where the English would later find Powhatan’s village, and quickly began to starve. Algonquians indicated “six years of famine and death” depleted food stores, and left them unable to aid the Jesuit missionaries. The Algonquian captive (Luis del Velasco/Opechancanough) escaped, and in early 1571 returned with an armed party that martyred the three Jesuit fathers (Weber 1992). \n\nMattaponi oral tradition states the growing Spanish threat encouraged Powhatan/Wahunsenaca to build alliances with neighboring groups as a way of enlarging the Powhatan nation, and to eventually befriend the English as potential allies when they arrived in 1607. Powhatan might have been a tiny bit surprised at their arrival and intention to stay, but the Jamestown settlers were not the first Europeans in the area, and unlike the film where he states “Let us hope they do not intend to stay,” they were coveted as partners against the Spanish, Monacans and Susquehannocks. The English eventually exhausted the Powhatan good will, and a state of constant tension, occasionally erupting into outright war, emerged after the first initial years.\n\nThe site of Jamestown itself was relatively uninhabited at the time. It was a swampy peninsula too poor for agriculture, plagued by mosquitoes, with brackish river water unfit for drinking. The one benefit was its defensibility, but the Powhatans must have thought the English were crazy for trying to live there. Arriving in May meant there was little time to plant crops. The movie provides us with a brief glimpse of Governor Ratliff’s table, which appears to be sumptuous. In reality, more than half the Jamestown settlers died before the First and Second Supply missions arrived in 1608, and during the period from 1609-1610 (Starving Time) only 61 of the roughly 500 colonists survived.\n\n30:31 John Smith and Pocahontas meet at a secluded waterfall and they fall in love at first sight. We have no evidence of romantic involvement between Smith and Pocahontas. She was 10, after all, and for all his faults there is no evidence Smith had affections for her. The first expression of romance between Pocahontas and Smith comes in 1755 from Edward Kimber’s “A Short Account of the British Plantations in America.”\n\n33:09 Pocahontas suddenly speaks English. That was fast.\n\n34:17 In the movie first contact between the main body of the English and Powhatan ends violently. In reality, Smith functioned as an intermediary between Jamestown and the Powhatan after his “capture” in late 1607. Starving colonists attempted to raid their neighbors for food in 1608, resulting in more hostilities, and by 1609 the Paspahegh were raiding the fort at Jamestown. An uneasy truce followed, and Starving Time began for the inhabitants of Jamestown. Wide scale warfare begins with the First Anglo-Powhatan War in 1610.\n\n40:12 Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains? Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? How I hate this “one with nature” trope surrounding Native Americans.\n\n44:54 “Wiggins, why did the Indians attack us?” “Because we invaded their land, cut down their trees and dug up their earth.” I like Wiggins.\n\n1:00:00 Kocoum is not a fan of interracial dating. John Smith was “captured” by the Powhatans in December of 1607. The “capture” was really a ritual ceremony dedicated to securing the relationship between the Powhatan and Jamestown by appointing Smith as a local chief (werowance), and not as a result of Kocoum’s murder. Kocoum would be killed by the English later on, in 1613, after Pocahontas was kidnapped. Mattaponi oral tradition states Smith knew he would be released in four days, and there would be absolutely no reason to kill a werowance initiate on the eve of establishing such a critical ritual bond.\n\n1:01:00 Women and children were not allowed in the ceremony so Pocahontas would not have been there to intercede for him. The werowance established Smith as a local governor of an individual town within Powhatan influence, and by extension the English at Jamestown as members of Powhatan society. \n\n1:07:45 Iconic image of Pocahontas saving John Smith. The only problem is, this moment likely didn’t happen at all. As stated earlier, women and children were not allowed at the werowance ceremony. Also, Smith’s own accounts fail to mention Pocahontas interceding for him until nearly 20 years after the event and Smith included three different “saved by a woman” stories about his travels. Smith’s first mention of Pocahontas was made in is his 1608 *True Relation*. Nothing is said of her saving him from death. The first published mention of her interceding on his behalf appears in Smith’s 1622 *New England Trials*. In 1623 his testimony before a royal commission investigating the Virginia Company Smith retells his rescue by Pocahontas. By the 1624 publication of *The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles* the rescue story has emerged into a full detailed and dramatic account. Smith suddenly amending his story to include his rescue by Pocahontas could have simply been a publicity move, or could represent a modification inspired by the Second Powhatan War. In the rescue narrative Pocahontas was an Ideal Indian (protective of the English, converted to Christianity, adopted English customs and dress, etc.).\n\n1:09:55 Governor Ratliff didn’t actually shoot Smith. Smith was injured in a gunpowder accident in October of 1609, likely igniting a bag of powder he was wearing. He then departs Virginia for medical attention in England, never to return to the colony.\n\n1:12:27 Finally, Percy the Pug goes native.\n\nThe movie ends on a happy sad note. Smith leaves for England, Pocahontas stays with her people, and we don’t learn how conditions in Jamestown deteriorate from here. I’ll get more into the deterioration with The New World review, but briefly Pocahontas is held captive in Jamestown before marrying John Rolfe. She is taken to England where she arrives to a royal reception, and is quite the curiosity. She dies in England in 1617, right before her planned return home. Disney of course omits the worst details. \n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "Okay, so I hem and haw about whether I actually like reddit dot com on the whole, but I truly love [the post that u/NMW wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pqzx5/objectively_speaking_what_the_nazi_regime_did_is/cd54xw0) about how people go through stages of understanding history. It's probably not fair to generalize to quite that extent, but I teach high school Social Studies, and I see it mirrored in my students on a pretty regular basis. If you haven't read it (and you should, it's pretty awesome), NMW is essentially pointing out that our understanding of history evolves over time as we gain more knowledge of it. That's a good thing, at least, as long as you allow yourself to continue to look for more information about a subject.\n\nBut, unfortunately, in the interim, things can get super irritating. Which I guess is why r/BadHistory exists.\n\nANYWAY, over on Imgur there's [a big ol' post about Hitler on the front page.](http://imgur.com/gallery/yU6KS) It's just a big long Tumblr discussion (prefaced by .gifs of a video showing Hitler being coy with a camera) about why Hitler wasn't truly \"evil\" and it is making me want to pull my hair out. Apparently it gets posted on Imgur all the time, but I couldn't find a reference to it here, so I apologize if it's come up before. Here are some choice quotes:\n\n&gt;[Hitler] wasn't evil for its own sake, let's try to remember that despite the countless murders, but for a moment, he did actually believe he was doing something for the good of his countrymen.\n\nand\n\n&gt;Hitler, though extremely wrong in his views, did everything he thought would better the lives of his people. It was wrong. It was disgustingly, horribly wrong. But he did not do it because it was evil and he was evil. He did it because he believed it would help Germany and those who needed a better life. Those who don't understand or even try to understand the human brain will always label men like him as 'evil' because it is easier to accept. But he wasn't 'evil.' He felt love and loyalty and responsibilities. He simply took these aspects and morphed them into a twisted, violent thing.\n\nThat last quote is either the possibly the craziest, most ignorant, or most clever Stormfront ruse that I have read in a long, LONG time.\n\n&gt;Hitler, though extremely wrong in his views, did everything he thought would better the lives of his people.\n\nHuh, who were \"his people,\" then? Austrians? The Germans? All Germans? That's interesting given the millions of German Communists, Jews, Roma, disabled, etc. he persecuted, drove out of their homes, murdered, etc. But maybe \"his people\" just refers to Aryans? Of course, that's insane too, because \"Aryan\" is a BS racial identity based on nothing, and even if you go based on the Nazi ideal of [Herrenvolk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrenvolk), why would Hitler invade the countries of and kill so many aligned to his racial ideal? Okay, maybe \"his people\" were just the Nazis. Then why would he let so many of \"his people\" die in and around Berlin when it became clear that the war was lost? Why didn't he surrender gracefully and protect the lives of his precious people?\n\nMAYBE it's because he was an selfish maniac who was actually in fact evil, and cared many thousand times more about himself and his political/genocidal conspirators than some imagined image of \"his people.\"\n\n&gt;Those who don't understand or even try to understand the human brain will always label men like him as 'evil' because it is easier to accept. But he wasn't 'evil.'\n\nThose who want to impress people on the internet will always try and put their flag on the great Gray Area of an argument because they think it makes them sound smart.\n\n&gt;He felt love and loyalty and responsibilities.\n\nI really love the loyalty part there, and I have a responsibility to tell the internet that Hitler routinely killed/purged those around him who he started to feel were threatening his power. I wonder how Ernst Rohm and the rest of the leadership of the SA felt about Hitler's supposed loyalty after the [Night of the Long Knives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives). Oh wait, they probably didn't feel anything! Because they were dead.\n\nAnyway, there's more, especially in the comments, but what it boils down to is another example of people on the internet taking a really silly stance on a historical subject, and stringing out that stance until it literally becomes \"Hitler was just a dude trying to get by in this crazy world of ours.\"",

I am ignorant about any pre-colonization events in the region, but there was never a conflict in this city under European control. Certainly not in 1812. A small wooden fort titled Ft Henry was built. If anyone is familiar with the modern Ft Henry, then 1812 building was much smaller than its 1832 reconstruction.\nEdit - this is not accurate. TheGuineaPig21 pointed out the Siege of Ft Frontenac\n\n-This ad is a troubling example of the way that the war of 1812 has been exploited in the past 3 years or so for profit and nation building. In this case, the city of Kingston is trying to create a falsified history and profit from it. \n\n-I suppose I can't fault a city for trying to bring money and interest to itself, but the exploitation of 1812 has become a fairly troubling aspect of \"heritage\" events in the past few years in Ontario",

He believes that the U.S. made a mistake in electing to ally with the USSR, and should have buddied up with the Nazis. The sad thing is, he makes /u/chabanais look like a reasonable person.\n\nAnyway, the comment reads:\n\n&gt;This was after the US already started helping the UK (the same UK which declared war against Germany) and funding the USSR. Good thing Churchill actually cared so much about Poland and other Central/Eastern-European countries after the war..oh wait.\n\n&gt;FDR drew the Japanese into attacking the US with his illegal sanctions..everyone knows that.\n\nFirst off, you can't blame Churchill for turning his back to Eastern Europe given the context, and what options Churchill had. The Soviets conquered those regions from the Germans and as a result wanted to keep their new influence there intact. This is the Soviet Union. They were powerful. It was Churchill's strong agenda, anyway, to push for free elections in Eastern Europe following the war, and came from Yalta with the assurance from Stalin that elections would be held in Poland, which Churchill held particular interest in given the support Poland gave in Britain's early defense as well as in North Africa. Both Churchill and Roosevelt soon after realized that this wasn't going to be the case, as Stalin conversely had particular interest in control over Poland. Nevertheless, you continually see Churchill express his frustration with this course of events following Yalta, during Potsdam, and thereafter, and to suggest that Churchill just gave the finger to Poland is nonsense.\n\nSecond (and this part is very simple to refute), there is no obligation for one nation to trade materials with another. The sanctions this person describes were initially a restriction of trading in steel, aircraft fuel, industrial raw materials, and so on during the initial stages of the sanctions. These sanctions (following Japanese refusal to withdraw from China and desist their aggressive campaign throughout Southeast Asia) were expanded to include oil, among other things, so as to hurt Japan's ability to carry out its war in China and throughout the Pacific, and which ran very contrary to U.S. interests. *An embargo is not illegal, nor is it in act of war.* **There is nothing based on international law that requires one nation to trade with another, nor is any nation required to aid its enemies in war.** To characterize the embargo on Japan as an illegal set of sanctions (specifically to goad Japan) makes no sense, the idea that FDR *wanted* to go to war with Japan is not supported by the evidence (even if it was becoming increasingly clear that this would happen), and the statement about false-flags leading to wars is not applicable to to these events. These are, thusly, very dumb historical judgements.",

German soldiers and nazis are two different things.\n\nWhile this is true, the differences between the way actual Nazis and German soldiers acted was sometimes hardly different. \n\n*After the end of hostilities, during the Wehrmacht's administration of Poland, which went on until October 25, 1939, 531 towns and villages were burned; the Wehrmacht carried out 714 mass executions, alongside many incidents of plunder, banditry and murder. Altogether, it is estimated that 16,376 Poles fell victim to these atrocities. Approximately 60% of these crimes were committed by the Wehrmacht.[9] Wehrmacht soldiers frequently engaged in the massacre of Jews on their own, rather than just assisting in rounding them up for the SS.[10]*\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht#Mass_murder_of_Polish_civilians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht#Mass_murder_of_Polish_civilians)\n\n&gt;The SS were the hardcore believers.\n\nThere was no shortage of hardcore believers in the army, either. We know this from numerous first hand accounts of German soldiers who wrote letters during the war. Particularly early in the war, when the Germans were winning, Hitler's worldview (The Jews and Bolsheviks were enemies, subhuman) was quite popular even down to the lowest of ranks. \n\n&gt;And the majority of the high ranking German officers were pretty old school and took duty and honor seriously.\n\nWhich is why few, if any of them really had any problems in principle with invading the Soviet Union and that it should be a war of annihilation of the populace. German generals tended to buy into the idea that WWI had been lost because of Jews and Communists sabotaging things, and thus had to be treated with the utmost contempt and harshness. \n\nOr there's the [Commando Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Order), carried out by the Wehrmacht, which was in flagrant violation of international law (and a disregard of customary soldierly duty and honor). As properly uniformed soldiers the shooting of them was illegal under The Hague Convention, and the Wehrmacht knew that (strongly evidenced by their attempts to conceal the existence of this order). \n\nOr there's the German treatment of Soviet POWs (again, Germany was obligated to treat prisoners within the laws and rules of war by the Geneva Convention.) Red Army POWs were routinely shot, starved, beaten, and used as slaves. They were sent to the death camps as well. Close to 60% of them died in German captivity (as compared to the 3% of Western Allied POWs in German hands). \n\n&gt;Much like Robert E. Lee during the American civil war. He opposed slavery and secession but would never fight against Virginia. \n\nOh God. Lee was a slave owner (I don't think I have to go into this too far on this subreddit, its been done more times than I can count better than I can...) who apparently thought slavery was an evil, but he thought its abolition was a **greater evil for white people** and that the issue was in God's hands to be decided (meaning blacks should be slaves until God magically freed them some unknown date in the future...5,10, 100, 1000 years from then? God will figure it out). \n\n",

Let's look at evidence:\n\nFirst off, we have the [Molotov Ribbentrop pact.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) This was a non  agression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. They agreed to not fight each otther or support the enemies of either country. They both invaded Poland. Some quotes from the pact:\n\n*Article I. Both High Contracting Parties obligate themselves to desist from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other Powers.*\n\nHere's a bit that was not made publicly, outlining their agreements over Poland:\n*Article II. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement of the areas belonging to the Polish state, the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. shall be bounded approximately by the line of the rivers Narev, Vistula and San.\n\n*Article III. With regard to Southeastern Europe attention is called by the Soviet side to its interest in Bessarabia. The German side declares its complete political disinteredness in these areas.*\n\n*Article IV. This protocol shall be treated by both parties as strictly secret.*\n\nIt seems rather strange that country trying to destroy Nazi Germany would sign a nonagression pact and divide pieces of eastern Europe for each other, no? Perhaps the Soviets soon broke the pact, right...????\n\n*[The Nonaggression Pact became a dead letter on June 22, 1941, when Nazi Germany, after having invaded much of western and central Europe, attacked the Soviet Union without warning in Operation Barbarossa.](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230972/German-Soviet-Nonaggression-Pact)*\n\nSo in short, the Nazis signed a non agression pact with the USSR, they then broke the pact by invading, and this person argues that the Nazis were fighting a defensive war. Let's note also, that because of the pact, the Soviet Union was not involved in roughly the first two years of World War II. Why, then, were the Germans fighting?\n\nNext post:\n\n&gt;So, my grandfather was on Omaha Beach at Normandy, 29th Infantry division, I believe, although it's been a while since my grandmother told me. However... Given that the US government tends to bend the truth a little and many times acts in the interest of economic gain for its supporters... What if the Germans were the good guys in WWII and we have just rewritten history through our massive propaganda machine? Is Germany taking back lands that have historically been Germanic as bad as the US invading Iraq and Palestine? Sometimes I wonder.\n\nOnce again, must ignore the rule 2. It seems the ghost of past Victors still haunts history. Let's do simple [map analysis (dark gray and black are Nazi Occupations).](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Europe_under_Nazi_domination.png/1024px-Europe_under_Nazi_domination.png) So here, Russia, Norway, France, Greece, and Ukraine are supposed to be \"Germanic Lands?\" They aren't. Poland is also not really Germanic, although Germany and Austria had previously controlled it. The Nazis were undisputed \"bad guys\" It's hard to argue the people responsible for the Holocaust were fighting the good fight. It's completely absurd to say that since the USA \"bends the truth a little,\" they therefore completely rewrote the history of what is perhaps the most recorded and studied event in history. \n\nMore bad history!\n\nThen we get to[ this /r/history post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/27gq1b/the_impact_of_dday_on_the_eastern_front_and_the/)\n\nA choice comment appears!\n\n&gt;\"one must not discount the scale of the contribution of the Red Army to fighting Nazi Germany.\"\nThat's like saying, \"one must not discount the role the sun plays in warming the earth.\" Just another example of the western myth that the US and Britain won WWII, with the eastern front being a side battle. WWII was primarily a war between the USSR and Germany.\n\nFirst off, WWII was by no means primarily a war between the USSR and Germany. The USSR was out of the early years of the war. Nazi Germany did a lot of conquest in Western Europe. There were also those Japanese, who did a lot of fighting with the USA. Indeed, the Eastern Front was very large and extremely important to the war effort, but things such as the lend-lease act, Operation Torch, and taking back of Western Europe by the other Allies were very key pieces in helping to win the European Theater. \n \nThat's all for now, but it's the anniversary of D-Day. This day is to bad history as St Patrick's Day is to beer. Browse the subreddits, and you can see much more bad history!\n",

Basically during this rebellion white and black indentured servants were being held past there 5 or 7 year contracts and they were pissed and so together poor white and black folk killed a bunch of rich people.\"](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/27gk80/nonamericans_of_reddit_how_do_you_view_america/ci0m004) \n\nThis is basically bullshit. While Bacon's Rebellion may have had a small impact on race relations *in Jamestown*, there's not much evidence to suggest it would have led to societal change in other colonies. In the seventeenth century, various North American settlements were hardly centralized, and news of the Rebellion would take weeks or longer to travel from Virginia to Massachusetts. While Bacon's Rebellion may have encouraged Virginia planters somewhat to utilize African slavery over primarily-white Indentured Servitude, there were a slew of other reasons for the importation of Africans, such as their knowledge of rice cultivation, distinguishability from free persons, and lifetime servitude. Claiming that Bacon's Rebellion was the be-all-end-all cause for *anything* is quite outlandish, especially something as complex as slavery. It seems that the only historian who claims that Bacon's Rebellion had a lasting impact on American race relations is [William J. Cooper](http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/Cooper.htm), but he's never gone so far as to claim that this single uprising is the \"cause of racial troubles\".\n\n/u/thesilverpig is either really ignorant or is intentionally ignoring the centuries of abuse suffered by African Americans during and after slavery. Race relations in the US have a lot more to do with the 20th century than the 17th century, and I have no idea what led the commenter to believe otherwise.",

        "text": "This also seems suitable for /r/badscience or /r/badanthropology, but I've never seen it discussed here and this sub is a lot of fun. So here goes.\n\nI have a friend who's been teaching high school math for a few years now. He's a smart guy, and I don't fault him for being ignorant of history and some science, because that's not what he's primarily interested and that's not what he studied in order to build a career from. (I, conversely, suck at math. And I am extremely slow and inaccurate when it comes to alphabetizing things.)\n\nWhere this becomes relevant to /r/badhistory is that, as a teacher of two Advanced Placement statistics classes, the end of the year has some time following the AP exam during which there is otherwise no new, necessary material to cover. He fills that time by assigning a project to count as the final exam, and spends the final few days of the course as well as the 2+ hour period that would otherwise be devoted to the final exam to allow the students to watch a few episodes of the series *Numbers*. That's all very well, as the show, as I understand, does a competent job in conveying to its audience how mathematics can be applied in exciting, unexpected ways. \n\nAnyway, this friend very recently came up to me described one scene in the show in which an astronomer at CalSci references some nonsense tale about how the natives observing the initial landing of Columbus' expedition did not initially even *see* the ships off on the horizon. (He actually presents it as a plausible story.) Presumably they were such foreign, confusing entities that it simply defied their ability to so much as *conceive* of such craft, and therefore failed to detect them...or something. This friend was bringing this to my attention because, although to him it sounded utterly bogus, but given that it came from the mouth of a character who is an astronomer, he was curious to see what I knew about this tale, and whether there was even a shred of truth to it, at least reports of it in the historical record.\n\nYes and no. I've seen this in one other place, that being the tedious and enormously bad, inaccurate film *What the Bleep Do We Know*. For those unfamiliar, this film commits an atrocity against the field of quantum physics by trying to blend it with new-age malarky about 'consciousness' and 'paradigms', and traditional religion, by deciding to ignore all the relevant science and instead let a bunch of non-scientists drone on and on, at times with their demonstrably incorrect theories. The claim in question, which somehow relates to all this, can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQcBQc3oaKg) (Warning: even clips of this film invariably make one stupider merely by the act of watching them.)\n\nThis is utter nonsense for two main reasons:\n\n1. The tale from which this is derived has nothing to do with Columbus, though it is on occasion attributed to an entirely fabricated account of his landing. It is also attributed to Magellan, supposedly found in his diaries—though I'm skeptical of that, considering that Magellan didn't keep any diaries. Antonio Pigafetta is a common source for accounts of the voyage, he having made it back to Europe (although not the first published account of the first circumnavigation of the globe). Unsurprisingly, there's no evidence of this detail in Pigafetta's writings.\n\n2. There is a surviving account of this from Captain Cook's landing in Australia in the late eighteenth century, but it can be far better attributed to a bad interpretation of historical evidence as well as a bad, one-sided explanation of their experiences from the European voyagers themselves. Not only that, the primary evidence actually notes that the aborigines did notice the ships themselves, but showed  I take the following from [this article:](http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/science/20/questioning_perceptual_blindness.html)\n\n&gt;The story actually traces back to Captain Cook and his landing in Australia in April 1770. In other first encounters, the locals sailed or paddled out to meet Cook’s ship.5 At Sandwich Sound in Alaska, they came in canoes, showing open hands as a sign of friendship. Off New Zealand, canoes full of Maoris were more aggressive: “They brandish their spears, hack the air with their patoo patoos and shake their darts as if they meant every moment to begin the attack.” 6 But when Cook arrived off Australia, his ship drew no reaction. According to the historian Robert Hughes: “It was the largest artefact ever seen on the East Coast of Australia, an object so huge, complex and unfamiliar as to defy the natives’ understanding.” This is clearly the origin of the tale of invisible ships. It was only when the Europeans landed in canoes that the natives took action: “The sight of men in small boats was comprehensible to them: it meant invasion.” 7\n\n&gt;Looking more closely at the accounts left by Captain Cook and the botanist Joseph Banks who travelled with him, we can see how this came about. They make it clear that the aborigines could see the ship: “We soon saw about 10 people, who on our approach left the fire and retird to a little emminence where they could conveniently see the ship.” 8 But their fishermen ignored it: “The ship passd within a quarter of a mile of them and yet they scarce lifted their eyes from their employment; I was almost inclind to think that attentive to their business and deafned by the noise of the surf they neither saw nor heard her go past them.” 9\n\n&gt;Villagers also saw, but ignored: “Soon after this an old woman followd by three children came out of the wood… She often lookd at the ship but expressd neither surprize nor concern.” Aborigines began to prepare dinner “to all appearance totaly unmovd at us, tho we were within a little more than a mile of them”. The Europeans were determined to make contact. “We set out from the ship intending to land at the place where we saw these people… as soon as we aproachd the rocks two of the men came down upon them, each armd with a lance… in all appearance resolvd to dispute our landing to the utmost tho they were but two and we 30 or 40 at least.”\n\n&gt;This is a repeated pattern, with the aborigines ignoring the Europeans offshore but reacting when they become a potential threat by attempting to land. Each time they either flee or meet the explorers with spears and threats, and are frequently met with musket fire in return. A few days later, Banks is still baffled by the indifference: “Not one was once observd to stop and look towards the ship; they pursued their way in all appearance intirely unmovd by the neighbourhood of so remarkable an object as a ship must necessarily be to people who have never seen one.”\n\nThis article is hardly an ideal secondary source, but it's all the effort I'm going to put into this, as it offers a similar explanation of the primary evidence to what I or any reasonable person would draw. Namely, that it's far more likely that the Europeans merely *interpreted* the Aborigines' lack of concern with their arrival (until their actual landing posed a direct threat) as a failure to comprehend just what was going on, assuming that such delayed and (as they saw it) *insufficient* interest with their obviously impressive presence meant something peculiar. Nope, we're just dealing with ordinary cultural bias here.\n\nI'd say it's even worse than this, though, as you don't even have to go to the historical evidence to realize just how stupid this is. It's clearly just some nonsense attempt to conform history to new-age hogwash about 'paradigms' and what-have-you, and certainly nothing that should come from the mouth of any astronomer. There's a wealth of examples of previously inconceivable things being discovered via scientific observation. Of course, you could say that the means of detection and reliance on past observation of rules and phenomena enable such discovery, but if you take that route, than you could just as easily say that the Aborigines/Indigenous Caribbean and South American peoples obviously knew things could float, and knew what large physical objects were—ergo, there's no reason that they couldn't conceive of large, floating physical objects. Especially boats, because ~~they also knew what boats were~~ boats fit into their cognitive 'paradigm'.\n\nEdit - edited some things.",

His first claim that I'm gonna discuss is this:\n\n&gt; Also ,that no matter how fantastic the advance of man-kind it has always been halted by religion or greed\n\nI'm having flashbacks to the chart! The first problem is that this seems to ignore all of the good things that are brought about by either religion or greed. I can think of several monks that were religious and religious people often play a part in establishing human rights. This isn't to say that all religions or all religious people are good, but this generalization is certainly majorly overstepping the facts. Greed has also inspired many inventors to create or improve something that we now enjoy. Henry Ford made an affordable car so that he could earn money, but I doubt OP would complain about having more affordable cars. This is clearly overly broad at best. \n\nSecondly, he says that it took the two world wars to get the advancement of mankind started again. \n\n&gt; it took a world war (or 2) for technology to boom again.\n\nI won't pretend that there weren't technological advances that happened because of the war, but its not like technology ground to a halt aside from those examples. There were plenty of new inventions or improved inventions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: telephones, light bulbs, electricity that was more widespread, moving pictures. The list can go on and on. There is no\"second\" dark age before the world wars that were ended by those wars. \n\nThen comes the fun stuff\n\n&gt; Television and rockets were made in Germany, due to Hitler \n\nThe television was invented before Hitler was even in power and my little bit of research shows that it was not even made by Germans. Wikipedia gives the honor of [first working television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television) to a Scottish inventor. There might well have been TVs made in Germany during Hitler's time in office, but he didn't cause the creation of television. Aside from that, I would hardly credit the television with being a piece of technology that we couldn't live without. Rockets are a little more nuanced. There were certainly advances in rocketry in Nazi Germany, but much of the foundation of work for [modern rocketry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket#Modern_rocketry) predates Hitler. Rockets had also existed for a long time. The bottom line for this is that it is somewhat true, but misleading. As a sidenote, I'm guessing that modern rocketry probably would have developed without Hitler. \n\n&gt; Cars even advanced more there \n\nI'm not an expert on German cars, but I can say this. Mercedes, a German car manufacturer, was responsible for many advances in automobiles, but it and some of these advances predates Hitler. The one example I can think of for the war years is the volkswagen brand and while it worked, I wouldn't really consider it a remarkable advance in automobile technology. \n\nFinally, we have this jem:\n\n&gt; the motorbike was invented there\n\nMy best guess is that he was referring to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler_Reitwagen). While this is German-made, it was made in 1885. That is four years before Hitler was even born. I wouldn't give Hitler credit for this. \n\nI'm not sure whether this guy is a Nazi apologist or whether he's just clueless, but there is so much bad info in this comment. ",

The issue seems to be that Greeks are incredibly afraid of a Macedonian irredentist movement trying to claim the area around Thessaloniki (which is *also* called Macedonia).  The user in question provided the map up front on that Wikipedia page.  Quoth the user:\n\n&gt; Basically the whole ancient city of Macedonia and the Palace of ancient Macedonia is located in Greece. The language is Greek and of course Alexander the Great expanded the empire all the way to the Indian river.\n\nMacedonia was a nation state/kingdom, not a city.  The palace, yes, is in present-day Greece.  But the kingdom he ruled was way more than just Greek.\n\nHowever, the map itself is rather suspect and seems rather tailored to support the Greek claim without anything even remotely resembling context: it does not label the date for which those approximate Macedonian Kingdom borders were remotely accurate.  It was likely sometime between [the Peloponnesian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_empire#mediaviewer/File:Map_Peloponnesian_War_431_BC-en.svg) and [Philip II's reign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_empire#mediaviewer/File:Map_Macedonia_336_BC-en.svg), just under a century later.  Of course, a lot can happen in a century: the United States went from controlling only territory east of the Mississippi to cutting across the entire North American continent in that same approximate time scale--and then saying that only the areas controlled by the US before the Louisiana Purchase are rightfully called the United States.\n\nLet's just ignore the whole thing with Alexander the Great, in which the Kingdom of Macedonia stretched from the Aegean Sea all the way to the Indus River Valley.  Let's ignore [the Roman province*s* named Macedonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province_of_Macedonia#mediaviewer/File:Macedonia_ad400.png), which Skopje, in the north of the current country of Macedonia is *just outside*.

        "text": "This is my first submission to this sub and I will be attacking truthfully a low hanging fruit If my post isn't at least meeting minimum requirements feel free to let me know.\n\nSo Im sure anyone in the U.S has heard this at least ounce someone who asserts Ben Franklin invented electricity , for example I could walk into any middle school and ask \" who invented electricity\" and get this response more often then not. Just from personal experience something that stuck with me was a fifth grade lesson on the founding fathers stating this as if it was a fact made by an actual teacher.\n\nSo to start out with what's wrong with this statement is wording you can't invent electricity it is a natural occurring phenomenon but let's give the benefit of the doubt and say when people say invent they mean harness. So next did Benjamin Franklin discover how to harness electricity? Short answer no. Long answer no just to list a few developments prior to Ben you have \n\nGerolamo Cardano first distinguished between electrical and magnetic force in 1550\n\n\nIn the late 16th century Dr. William Gilbert coined the word electricus - from the Greek meaning amber.\n\nRobert Boyle (1627—1691) conducted many electrical experiments.\n\nOtto von Guericke invented an early electrostatic generator in 1660.\n\nSir Thomas Browne first used the word electricity in 1646.\n\nAt most you can argue and credit franklin his key experiment discovering lightning is a form of electricity",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/27b3i8/300_badhistory_review/",
        "text": "This is the much-anticipated review of 300. There were a few inaccuracies that the movie repeated several times, so I just mentioned it once. A quick heads-up I'm not an historian so it is possible that I missed some things or that I get something wrong.\n\n1.\t(0:01:26) Babies were inspected by a council of elders, not one man. While some claim that babies were thrown off the cliff at Mount Taygetos (as the movie pretty heavily implies), they were most likely just left to die of exposure.\n\n\n2.\t(0:03:31) Spartan boys were not sent out into the wild in some sort of Bear Grylls, Man vs. Wild survival test. They were supposed to live off the land, but their primary goal was to murder any Helots (or slaves) that they came across. \n3.\t (0:05:51) Leonidas did not finish Cryptea and return to Sparta a king, as is claimed. He only had to do it because he was the 3rd son of the king, and thus not the heir. He only  became king after both of his brothers died.\n4.\t (0:10:47) Leonidas mocks Athenians as boy lovers, even though pederasty was quite common in Sparta.\n5.\t(0:11:57) The scene where emissaries were killed and thrown down a well by the Spartans actually happened. Except it happened during the first Persian invasion of Greece (300 is set during the second). \n6.\t(0:15:30) The Ephors were not the priests of Sparta, in fact that was the Kings job. They were elected officials, who ran Sparta. They also didn’t live on the top of a mountain.\n7.\t(0:19:02) The Ephors fully intended to fight the Persians, despite the carnea. They sent the advance guard of 300 as a stop-gap measure (not a trick by Leonidas) until carnea finished. \n8.\t (0:18:25) The oracles were not Spartan women, but citizens of Delphi, and thus were not sex slaves to the ephors (as was implied), or anyone. Also while people put great weight on their words, their prophecies did not dictate Sparta’s foreign or military policy. \n9.\t(0:23:03) The Spartans were not fighting for freedom (and least not in the Western sense). True, Sparta ~~had democracy~~   was a fairly democratic society compared to some of their contemporaries, especially Persia, but they had a slave population numbering in the thousands. \n10.\t(0:24:44) The movie acts like there was a big opposition to any fighting by the politicians of Sparta (see #7), when they actually really wanted to fight the Persians. \n11.\t(0:27:56) The film states that the fighting was done by only 300 Spartans and a few hundred Acadians. The actual estimate of Greek combatants is estimated to be in the several of thousands, including several hundred Thespians and Corinthians, not to mention the planned reinforcements. \n12.\t(0:30:22) What town could an Immortal scouting party have raided? The Persians were coming in from the north, and were Spartans moving in from Laconia, to the south-west.\n13.\t(0:35:51) While Queen Gorgo did have active role in politics, often advising Leonidas, but she did not do any lobbying like in the movie.\n14.\t(0:40:41) Frank Miller keeps pretending the Spartans hated slavery and the Persian were evil slavers. It was the opposite. \n15.\t(0:40:55) The scene with the whip-wielding envoy never happened. And the remark about “fighting in the shade” was made before the Spartans marched on Thermopylae.\n16.\t(0:41:49) Ephialtes in “300” is a Spartan hunchback. In reality, he was not born of Sparta (he lived near Thermopylae) nor was he a hunchback. He was just a normal guy.\n17.\t(0:44:33) In the movie the Persians loose their volley after the first wave of infantry is wiped out. What actually happened is that the arrows were fired first, then the infantry was sent in (a much smarter tactic). \n18.\t (0:48:07) Movie shows semi-accurate phalanx fighting for all of 3 seconds. Greeks would have never left the phalanx to pull fancy shit, because that would defeat the purpose of a phalanx. \n19.\t(0:48:57) For some reason, no Persian soldiers shown after the very first skirmish are carrying their trademark wicker shields. \n20.\t(0:50:06) Movie completely ignore the other Greek soldiers who fought at Thermopylae, who made a significant contribution. The Spartans did not do all the fighting. Multiple different groups of soldiers were rotated in and out of combat to avoid fatigue. \n21.\t (0:51:39) No cavalry fought on the first day of the battle. \n22.\t(0:54:10) The Prince of Sparta was exempt from warrior training, so Queen Gorgo would not have been worried about her son going to train, unlike what Councilman Theron says. \n23.\t(0:54:59) The Spartan government wanted to fight the Persians, yet the movie has a hard-on for saying they didn’t want to. \n24.\t (0:57:15) Xerxes and King Leonidas did not meet during the Battle, and Leonidas was never offered to be “warlord of Greece”. Also Xerxes probably looked nothing like he was portrayed in the movie.\n25.\t(0:58:55) Leonidas says “You have many slaves, but few warriors”. Even though the Spartans had a shit-ton of slaves (true they did not use them as soldiers), and the Persians had a habit of freeing slaves.\n26.\t(1:02:06) The uniforms of the Immortals is wrong. They wore very brightly colored robes, not the strange breastplate and black cloth combination the movie shows. Also the immortals were sent in during the day, not the night. \n27.\t(1:04:17) I probably don’t need to tell you that the Persians didn't have 7 foot tall monsters fighting for them. \n28.\t(1:07:32) Like Spartans, the Arcadians wear practically no armor. The greeks fought heavily armored, with breastplates. \n29.\t(1:09:52) Persians never used rhinos on the battlefield.\n30.\t(1:10:53) The Persian would not have access to gunpowder (which is what I assume is in the jars the guys are throwing, it could be Naphtha but the nature of the explosion is most like gunpowder) until several hundred years after this movie was set.\n31.\t(1:12:19) War elephants were not used at Thermopylae. Although the Persian army did use them, just not in this war.  \n32.\t(1:23:20) Movie heavily implies that Phocian forces were overwhelmed and killed (“scattered without a fight”). They didn’t even fight the Persians, instead just retreated to their city, and the Persians marched past them. \n33.\t (1:28:47) “Thousands leave, a handful stay.” No, hundreds stayed, including Thebans and Thespians, who died fighting just like the Spartans. \n34.\t (1:39:24) None of the strange “fake surrender” ruse that’s shown happened. There was a normal straight-up fight. And Leonidas was not the last to die. After he was killed, the Spartans tried to recover his body so the Persians couldn't get it, but were ultimately unsuccessful (seeing as how they all died). \n35.\t(1:48:30) At Plateae, the Greeks were probably outnumbered by less than 3 to 1, 2 to 1 at most. \n\n\nSources:\nhttp://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/societies/greece/spartan_society/sparta_sources/ancient_sparta_sources.htm\n\nhttp://www.ancient.eu.com/leonidas/\n\nhttp://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=7:chapter=226\n\nXenophon, Constitution of the Lacedaimonians \n\nHerodetus, the histories\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_I\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae\n\n\n",

Especially in light of what comes later.\n\n&gt;As soon as he got in power, he completly reformed everything and made it so well we still use most of what he did at the time. Napoleonic Civil Code? Still in use today in France and in several European countries. Dividing France in Régions and Départements so it gains in efficiency? Still basically the same divisions today. etc...\n\n\nNot my area of expertise, but from what I understand this is a vast overstatement, if anyone has anything to add, please do.\n\n&gt;He basically took power in a failing State and turned it into a very efficient country in a matter of years, he also promoted gender equality (not our modern vision of true equality of course, it was 200 years ago, but he definitly tried to make things better for the women) and enforced revolutionary principles of equality before the law and meritocracy.\n\nHe in fact turned France around so much that it could not survive without forcing extortionate payments and levies from occupied territories. Not that he was given a good position to start from, but Napoleon's France was far from a model of administration. I won't touch the gender stuff since I know very little about it.\n\n&gt;Most of the greatest generals of the Empire were sons of bakers or inn-owners who elevated in the hierarchy not because they had titles and money but because they were good at what they did (Napoleon himself was from the small bourgeoisie).\n\nNot mentioned is that nearly all of Napoleon's generals were already in the Army before the revolution, and were simply unshackled from restrictions on advancement due to their low birth. I'll grant that this is a good example of meritocracy, but not an example of a true \"citizen army.\"\n\n&gt;Peoples often give him shit for being a warmongerer, but the Napoleonic wars have been started before his accession of power and were a result of European monarchies creating an alliance with the explicit aim of taking over Revolutionary France and put back a king there. France therefore demanded that this alliance be cancelled or it would be war, the monarchies never answered so France declared war.\nIt still counts as a defensive war to me as the objectives of the European Monarchies were really obvious.\nAll the Napoleonic wars that followed were basically this : European Monarchies attack France &gt; they have their asses kicked &gt; France occupies territories as a result &gt; Peace &gt; European Monarchies form an alliance &gt; They attack France &gt; they have their asses kicked &gt; France occupies more territories as a result &gt; Peace &gt; European Monarchies form an alliance &gt; They attack France &gt; they get their asses kicked &gt; France occupies more territories as a result &gt; Peace Etc... (part in bold is a simplification of the events, it was of course a bit more complicated than that).\n\nUmm, no, this is far more than a simplification, crossing the line to outrageous lie. The revolutionary wars were started by the French revolutionaries over a perceived threat by the major European monarchies, caused mostly by misreading official reactions to the french revolution.. The resulting series of wars had various causes, among them was certainly french aggression. Napoleon's attempt to seize Egypt was anything but a defensive gesture. Many of the wars fought over the course of Napoleon's reign were in fact not directly started by him, but were generally the result of French provocation, usually by disregarding the terms of previous peace treaties.\n\n&gt;Until Russia is paid by the Brits to turn on France (France and Russia were allies before that) and Napoleon refuses to give up to Russian threats and therefore has to go to war with Russia which caused his demise.\n\nThis is a funny way to describe Napoleons failed effort to prevent Russia from trading with Britain.\n\nThere's a bit more, but I need to go drink heavily now. Anyone who has better counterpoints feel free to share them, I didn't have any good reference material close at hand. Most of my points are drawn from what I remember of reading [this](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Pursuit_of_Glory.html?id=4cjaXoKDLRMC) book.\n\nEdited to fix link",

This is doubly anachronistic, as the Mustang was introduced in 1964, and the Boss 429, a special edition to homologate the Ford *429* engine for NASCAR that was produced between 1969 and 1970 in extremely small numbers (like less than 1000, according to Leo Levine's *Ford: The Dust and the Glory, A Racing History 1968-2000*). Additionally, there is a picture on the top right of a 1962 cover of sports illustrated, which *says* 1962. \r\rI know it's a bit unusual, but for crying out loud, it's a history assignment at a private school!

        "text": "[This one's an oldie](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1f2ac7/when_the_japanese_army_occupied_indonesia_in_wwii/ca64yop)\n\n&gt;\n\nTwo people were here discussing whether or not there were paid prostitutes within the comfort women in a thread discussing Dutch women who were kidnapped from the Philippines to work as comfort women. To anyone who doesn't know, \"comfort women\" is a euphemism for women who were sexually enslaved by Imperial Japanese military forces during World War II. When confronted with the growing amount of rape incidents in Shanghai, officers first opened the first comfort women station in 1932. They were hoping to head off Anti-Japanese sentiment in the locals by reducing the amount of rape cases. \n\n&gt;As with most other things in life, the answer is probably **halfway true.** Were there enslaved prostitutes? Yes. Were there independent women who were enterprising enough to get paid for their services? Also yes. However, I am inclined to believe the paid ones were in the minority.\n\n&gt;A document compiled within the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, dated 4 November 1938, contains a request that agents be designated in different prefectures to recruit 400 women: 100 from Osaka Prefecture, 50 from Kyoto Prefecture, 100 from Hyogo Prefecture, 100 from Fukuoka Prefecture, and 50 from Yamaguchi Prefecture. The recruitment, which was to be carried out in a top-secret fashion, was in response to a request from two men: (i) Arifumi Kumon, who was a Major in the army’s aviation squad and a staff officer in the Furusho’s Army of the \nSouth China Expeditionary Force, and (ii) the head of the Enlistment Division of the Army Ministry. Their request was: “Please help… sending… about 400 women for the purpose of prostitution… at comfort stations of the Southern China \nExpeditionary Force.”\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20070628152156/http://www.awf.or.jp/woman/pdf/ianhu_ei.pdf\n\nWhat kills me is this guy is almost like broken clock that's right for once. Yes, technically there were \"independent women who were enterprising enough to get paid.\" As you can see from the above quote, those were almost exclusively Japanese women brought over from Japan, back in the early years of the Second Sino-Japanese war. Paid prostitutes were recruited in the infancy years of this program, yes... Unfortunately, Japanese command seemed to think the program worked too well. The number of comfort stations expanded rapidly. Did this mean comfort women *actually* worked, the merits of which debating I am never **NEVER** going to do? More likely, the army was getting out of control. In any case, the Japanese Army couldn't recruit enough women from Japanese territories alone, and so were forced to start recruiting from the local populations. \n\nNow, time to nit-pick so I don't leave this with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n&gt;Were there enslaved prostitutes? Yes. Were there independent women who were enterprising enough to get paid for their services? Also yes.\n\nBull\n\nShit\n\nBullllllllllllshit if you're referring to the period of time when comfort stations basically turned into rape factories. As the OP of the original thread was saying, why in God's name would the Japanese Army *pay* anyone who came to offer their prostitution services when they were already wholesale kidnapping women to do they they did, but for free? There is also the fact that even if a Korean prostitute did hypothetically go to the Japanese despite their horrible reputation literally *everywhere* that doesn't stop what transpired afterwards as anything but a brutal warcrime. \n\n&gt;G.J. McDougal, the Special Rapporteur for the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, presented a report to the Sub-Committee on 22 June 1998 entitled Contemporary Forms of Slavery: Systematic Rape, Sexual Slavery and Slavery-like Practices During Armed Conflict. The report has an appendix entitled An Analysis of the Legal Liability of the Government of Japan for 'Comfort Women Stations' established during the Second World War (Full text see). The appendix includes the following passage:\n&gt;&gt;Between 1932 and the end of the Second World War, the Japanese Government and the Japanese Imperial Army forced over 200,000 women into sexual slavery in rape centers throughout Asia.\"\n\"Only about 25 per cent of these women are said to have survived these daily abuses.\"\n\n*75% of comfort women died.* Did these hypothetical willing, paid Korean prostitutes have some magic rape shield that immunized them to what killed 3/4s of their ilk? Or were they just totally cool with being pounded to death? Or, more likely in this mind-numbingly stupid hypothetical scenario, those unfortunate enough to actually offer themsleves up on a silver platter would have been raped to death just like everyone else because comfort stations might actually be the Lust circle of hell? This is all ignoring the fact that the Japanese army did *plenty* of recruiting-- by lying and saying that they were offering factory or labor jobs before pulling the switcheroo. \n\nWhen asked *why* believe this particular idiocy, he replies:\n\n&gt;Because it's the world's oldest profession. It happens in every society. The burden of proof is on you to prove it didn't happen, because Occam's razor dictates that it most likely did.\n\nCan I kill myself now or is that letting the terrorists win?\n\n&gt;People have a natural tendency to see things as black and white. But the truth is, Japanese control of the Korean peninsula wasn't uniform and absolute. \n\nNo, certainly not. Japanese ~~control~~ hostile fucking occupation of the Korean peninsula wasn't uniform, nor absolute. Some cities would only have 300 young men drafted into forced labor, and some villages might have only three girls raped to death, and it's not like every person was sent to Unit 731... God....Is this seriously an argument these days, or did evil invading empire here have to oppress **everything blade of grass** evenly before we can call Imperial Japanese occuption as \"pretty bad, mmmkay\"?\n\n/u/jjrs is quick to point out how stupid this is.\n\n&gt;If you want to invoke burden of proof, you should be aware that by asking me to prove it didn't happen, you're imposing an Unfair Burden. You can't prove a negative. You're the one that made the claim some were paid, so now you have to back it up. I'm not even saying people getting paid to get gangbanged didn't happen myself, simply that I'm more and more suspicious of these kinds of claims, because the people making them never seem to have any evidence. Now is certainly no exception.\n&gt;While I'm willing to entertain the possibility of paid military brothels if you have any Japanese links recording their existence, in the case of absence of evidence, both the history of the military brothels we do have record of (all forced labor), and Occam's razor, and elementary game theory and study of rational actors, all clearly suggest that military brothels in the habit of taking women by force won't also pay money for something they normally got for free, even by your own admission. Even your fellow apologists agree: the top-rated comment in this thread is by a guy shrugging this off and saying raping women, not prostitution, is what always happens in times of war.\n\nThe genius strikes again, though: he's not wrong! He's just thinking outside of the box! \n\n&gt;Once again, you're showing your inability to think outside the box. I never suggested that there had to be \"paid military brothels\". Not everything in occupied Korea was officially run by the Japanese military. When a country gets occupied, the people's lives don't suddenly get micromanaged by the invaders. Korea was occupied for several decades. It wasn't a constant state of war. And invaders use locals who help them out to keep the order.\n\nYou know who else thought outside the box? Hitler.\n\n\n&gt;And if you have to resort to ad hominem attacks like calling me an apologist, you have clearly completely failed to understand the point I was making.\n\nEven if you were using ad hominem right, that's still a fallacy fallacy. Just because he called you an apologist (which you are) doesn't mean he's not right about you being an idiot (which you also are). If he wanted to ad-honimem, he would have called you wrong because you're a weeaboo-sucking ugly fat neckbeard fothermucker who's trying to deflect blame away from the historically largest and most brutal slavery organizations focused solely on industrial amounts of rape, and *I* will call you that because fuck you.\n\n&gt;(My comment) partly explains why there is confusion on the matter, because many people are conflating paid prostitutes and enslaved comfort women, which muddies the discussion.\n\nThe only person conflating anything are historical revisionists and you. There is no discussion of hypothetical--non-existant--willing--*paid* Korean prostitutes peacefully plying their trade with the Japanese Army and the enslaved women who were being raped to death on a daily basis next door. Even if there ever was someone like that who offered themselves to the Japanese Army during the height of the comfort program's infamy, they almost certainly would have been impressed into slavery, and most likely have been raped to death.\n\nGod damn it now I've got these horrible images in my head. Fuck these people for making me think of these awful things just to refute their fantasies.\n\nSome more \"gems\" from that entire post's comments section:\n\n&gt;Things about Korean part is lack of evidence that Japanese authorities kidnapped or forced Korean women to be prostitute (even Japanese scholars who support comfort women admit there isn't). Speaking of their claim they recently escalated it like 200,000 women got kidnapped or forced to go, No report while 70%(?) of local Japanese police were Koreans? No recorded discussion on kidnapping thing in 1965 treaty? Thinking normally, that's simply not possible, while 200,000 must have had about 400,000 parents and millions of relatives, it had been kept secret until late 80s? Those claims make me feel their any claim might be non-trustworthy.\n\nFirst off, dipshit, all of the numbers we have are estimates because the Japanese Army had done their best to destroy evidence of their atrocities come end of the war. That remind you of anyone? Like the Nazis? So are you literally a Nazi apologist? Besides your infalliblily stupid \"common sense\" that tells you these numbers are \"not possible\", historians have real actual reasons as to why they estimate from 90,000 to up to 300,000, and they don't hang upon the lips of an internet historian and his \"common sense\"\n\n&gt;Taking the case of the 21st Army in 1939, Yoshimi estimated 1 comfort woman for \nevery 100 military personnel. He put the total number of personnel at 3,000,000 \nmen, giving 30,000. Yoshimi then multiplied this number by a replacement rate of \n1.5, to give a total of 45,000 comfort women. \n \n&gt;Then taking a different tack, Yoshimi applied common saying used among agents to \nestimate 1 comfort woman for every 30 military personnel. This gave 100,000, \nwhich he multiplied by a replacement rate of 2.0 to give 200,000 comfort women. \n \n&gt;These two calculations yield a low of 50,000 and a high of 200,000, giving us a \nrough idea of how many comfort women there were. \n \n&gt;A scholar of China published different estimates in 1999, taking the second figure \ncalculated by Yoshimi (100,000) but multiplying it by replacement rates ranging from \n3.5 to 4.0, to arrive at a range of from 360,000 to 410,000 comfort women. These \nnumbers, too, are of course based only on hypotheses. \n \n&gt;Ikuhiko Hata, in his first book (1993), posits 1 comfort woman for every 50 military \npersonnel, and a replacement rate of 1.5. With the number of military personnel \nstationed overseas at 3,000,000, the calculation yields 60,000 x 1.5 = 90,000 \ncomfort women. In 1998, he published a paper repudiating Yoshimi’s figures and  \nthe calculation method he himself had used in his first book, but his second book \n(1999) reinstates the calculation method because, “however mediocre it may be, it \nseems to be the most trustworthy.” However, in the second book, he reduces the \nnumber of military personnel from 3,000,000 to 2,500,000, and posits 1 comfort \nwoman for every 150 military men (after considering the fact that there were \n200,000 licensed prostitutes in Japan and a potential total of 30 million customers). \nUsing these figures, Hata calculated 16,000 women multiplied by a replacement \nrate of less than 1.5 to yield 20,000 comfort women. \n \n&gt;Obviously, these calculations all depend on both the estimated number of military \npersonnel per comfort woman and the replacement rate. Here, it is worth \nmentioning this written record: “Brought in a group of comfort women — 1 woman \nfor 100 soldiers.” This record from an April 1939 report of the head of the medical \nsquad of the 21st Army in Shanghai, appears in a memo in the Operations Journal \nof Setsuzo Kinbara, Chief of the Medical Affairs Section in the Medical Affairs \nDepartment of the War Ministry. \n \n&gt;If we use this ratio of 1 comfort woman per 100 military personnel, and if we \nestimate that on average a soldier went to a comfort station once a month, we could \nposit that each comfort woman was visited by five soldiers in one day, with an \naverage 10 days off per month. Since women would sometimes have been unable \nto work because of sickness, we can accept these estimates as being close to \nactual numbers. \n\nBesides, saying that 200,000 women being sexually enslaved and it being a secret is unreasonable because they'd have 400,000 parents to out them is stupid, because in case you were too busy mastrubating over a picture of Emperor Hirohito while singing broken Japanese to the tune of the *Evangelion* theme song with your $50 WWII replica katana in the other hand to notice, *20 million people* died in the Pacific Theatre from the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, to the Treaty at San Francisco. Is it so hard to believe that these women-- lied to with promises of high-paying jobs that didn't entail them being raped to death, whisked away, never to be seen again by their loved ones, assuming they had loved ones still alive that didn't die from [war-induced famine](http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/C/a/Casualties.htm), [biological weapons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang-Jiangxi_Campaign) or bullets-- would have slipped under the radar, considering that 100x as many people were just flat-out dying everywhere? \n\nIs that *really* so hard to believe?\n\n&gt;Another thing is the women's confession were kind of dubious and changing like going to Indonesia in 1937, or another woman were firstly speaking out about her grudge against her parents who sold her at press briefing in Japan, but her confession escalates time after time and made contradictions, years later she started talking about how she was forced to get on a truck by Japanese army. Another woman said, in 2004, she was took in 1944 and forced to serve sexual service for 3 years, three years later she said she was released in 1945\n\nFuck, dude, sometimes I forget my own English name. Why is it so weird that a [nineteen-year old girl](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/白馬事件) who has been raped for 2-3 years on a 24/7 basis gets some dates wrong on when exactly did it start and stop?\n\nGod--my 21st birthday can't come fast enough.",

        "text": "I'm subscribed to /r/historicalwhatif and I love it. All sorts of neat, hypothetical scenarios are interesting to read about and some of the detailed, long hypothetical timelines splitting away from changed events are almost like a mini novel in their own right. Generally the place seems to have fairly decent history most of the time. \n\n\n\nBut then I came across [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/2728ak/you_are_teleported_back_in_time_to_1000_ad_with/) which occurred earlier today. It asks users if they were sent back in time with around 100 Kg of supplies of their choosing, what time period could they gain the most influence? \n\n\n\nThere are some good answers here of course. /u/Sarlax writes out a [nice scenario](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/2728ak/you_are_teleported_back_in_time_to_1000_ad_with/chws56d) that sounds practical enough. But then there are [other ones.](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/2728ak/you_are_teleported_back_in_time_to_1000_ad_with/chx76fl)\n\n\n\nA common trope with redditors answering those 'if you went back in time' questions is the idea that us modern humans are some godly race of enlightened intellectuals who could easily bewilder those dirty feudal barbarians with out magical science powers and ensnare ourselves kingdoms and riches at the drop of a hat. Nevermind existing political institutions, nevermind being a weird-sounding foreigner who doesn't speak the language or have any connections with anyone influential, never mind that scholars and monarchs aren't just going to roll over like a puppy once you demonstrate penicillin or firearms. \n\n\n\nSo this isn't entirely bad history, but it does commit bad history by simplifying the complexities of government and reality back then, just assuming that our glorious scientific knowledge would make us seem like the second coming of Christ. \n\n\n\n[Here's a fine one:](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/2728ak/you_are_teleported_back_in_time_to_1000_ad_with/chxjb42)\n\n\n&gt; An assorted variety of artificial gems and diamonds.\nA 1kg bag of spices (cinnamon, saffron, nutmeg, etc).\nSeveral doses of weaponized Smallpox and Bubonic Plague\nThe rest of the weight in smallpox vaccines and antibiotics.\n\n\nVery well.\n\n\n\n&gt; The plan: Arrive in a small Mediterranean island (Sardinia, Sicily, etc) posing as a silk/spice merchant from the east. Any accent/mannerisms/idiosyncrasies I have from me speaking modern Italian will be chalked up to the fact that I'm foreign.\n\n\nYes, a modern-day Italian with zero knowledge of anything in the world would pass off excellently as an eastern silk merchant. \n\n\n\n&gt; Use my gems and spice to gain influence and establish a local villa. Over the next 5 years, gain the confidence of the local authorities and train a small force of soldiers and lieutenants loyal to me, while continually stocking up on food stuffs and supplies. Bribe or cajole rulers and nobles that can be bribed. Kill or depose those that can't.\n\n\nLocal nobility and government is going to ignore the rapidly expanding inexplicably wealth foreigner? \n\n\n\n&gt; On year 6, unleash the plague and use the ensuing chaos to take over my island, while vaccinating any friendly people to my cause.\n\n\nBrilliant, unleashing an uncontrollable plague on the local population seems like a swell plan. Does this person know how complicated the current plague vaccine is? Multiple dosages, booster shots, and of course I doubt they'd know all the correct dosages. \n\n\n&gt; Pose as a Religious Prophet and pass off my superior knowledge as messages from God and my vaccines as long lost elixirs of the Holy Land.\n\n\n\nAs you please.\n\n\n\n&gt; Continue to develop economically as the rest of Europe and the world slowly dies. Deny all refugees to my island and have all visitors killed on sight.\n\n\n\n*What?* Develop economically? Yeah, that should go really swell as the rest of the major economic players suffer from an unstoppable all-consuming plague. How are they developing if no one can come in to trade? There's no money coming in, no resources, etc. How many people are they vaccinating? It can't be that many, and the plagues going to decimate the majority. \n\n\n&gt; Institute social and economic reforms: universal education for all, religious reform (since the Catholic church is now collapsed), equal rights for women, etc. \n\n\n\nI'm going to overturn centuries of tradition and practice just like that! Also why is the church fallen? The plague killed a lot of people but it sure didn't destroy the Church. \n\n\n\n&gt; In ten years time, once the plague has run its course through the rest of Europe and Asia, unleash my military forces and conquer what's left of the plague survivors.\n\n\nWhat military forces? The few dozen/hundred people you vaccinated? The Plague didn't kill THAT many people. \n\n\n\n&gt; Spend the next 20 years consolidating my power and uniting Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. \n\n\n\nYou know only one group did that right? The Roman Empire, at its peak, with infinitely more resources. \n\n\n\n&gt;  Industrialize.\n\n\nEasy-peasy I'm sure. Just describe this technology that you don't understand to people who don't understand it and bam! Instant industrial revolution, why didn't anyone else think of that?\n\n\n\n\nOr here's another brilliant user who thinks [him and a few guns could take 1066 England](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/2728ak/you_are_teleported_back_in_time_to_1000_ad_with/chx9m11)\n\n\n\n&gt; 1066 might be a good year. Slaughter all three armies, convince those who surrender to support him as the new king. Once the throne is secure, start using knowledge of the future to kickstart the industrial revolution, mass produce futuristic weapons and take over first the British Isles, then France, then Europe and then the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nNever knew becoming a King was that easy. All you have to do is kill the king? I swear I thought there'd be more effort in conquering an established dynasty. William the Conqueror was an invader yes, but he was also high-born nobility with an army of supportive nobles. Some random outsider who kills the king with mysterious weapons sure as hell ain't getting the throne. \n\n\n\n[What's the key to the French/Frankish kingdom in the 900s? Steel!](http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/2728ak/you_are_teleported_back_in_time_to_1000_ad_with/chx285g)\n\n\n&gt; Steel. I'll go back to say 900 AD and use steel to become the king of France.\n\n\n\nBrilliant! Because steel didn't exist back then! Except high-quality products like crucible steel which was found from Europe to the far east. \n\n\n\n&gt; Well I meant cheap affordable steel, like Andrew Carnegie's invention and such.\n\n\n\nAh, another insta-industrial revolution I see. Good luck there. \n\n\n\nHonestly, this idea that us modern meta-humans could befuddle and bedazzle those ignorant dark-age primitives into submission with a few science tricks irritates me to no end. It seriously emphasizes the idea that ancient people couldn't wrap their sandals without praying to the gods and were basically a bunch of superstitious ninnies until glorious science came to their aid.

        "text": "The terrible pun inherent in my title will soon become apparent. \n\nAnyway, I was reading the Wiki article on General William Westmoreland, linked [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Westmoreland). Scrolling down to the \"Views\" section, two entire paragraphs are dedicated to (as far as I can tell) esoteric sources taken somewhat out of context. For instance, Derek Frisby's quotation about General Giap, commander of NVA forces during Vietnam, comes from an article written specifically about Giap- Westmoreland is mentioned once during the interview. Yet, this quotation makes up a third of the \"Views\" section. The preceding paragraph is built on the views of somebody named Nick Turse and reads like a book report. Only by doing some google digging did I discover that Turse is a historian at Columbia and the source mentioned is his Ph.D dissertation. I would have expected that information to appear in the citation.\n\nI'm hardly a fan of William Westmoreland, and I don't mean to impugn the sources themselves. Some of the criticism of his leadership and attitude seems spot on, but I'm finding myself questioning whether it makes sense to include what pretty much amount to the unfiltered opinions of individual historians in his wiki article. As a sidenote, a particularly racist quotation attributed to Westmoreland is included without a linked citation. \n\nThis leads me to my main point. There seem to be structural issues in many wiki articles that could lead to misunderstandings if they aren't read carefully and sources not followed up on. Cherry-picked quotations from online media shouldn't be bases for entire article sections, especially for those regarding controversial history.\n\nSo, any thoughts on this topic? I'm wondering if anybody else has come across questionable content in Wikipedia before. This case seems to be rather mild in both scope and magnitude, but I can't help feeling there's more where this came from.",

        "text": "[The painting \"Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq\" (also known as \"The Night Watch\") by the famous Rembrandt van Rijn, painted in 1642,](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt.jpg) is one of the most famous paintings in the world.  But, did you know that director Peter Greenaway made not only a movie but also a documentary that presents some bad history involving an idea that this painting was heavily involved in the conspiracy to cover up a murder?  So, not only did Greenaway make a film about this (starring Martin Freeman as Rembrandt), he then made a documentary to support this idea (a documentary made in conjunction with The Rijksmuseum Amsterdam).  Kyle Kallgren reviews both on location in the Netherlands in his internet review series \"Brows Held High\":      \n      \nhttp://blip.tv/brows-held-high/brows-held-high-nightwatching-rembrandt-s-j-accuse-6595298      \n      \nThrough this film (which itself is shot a lot like Rembrandt's paintings in terms of framing of shots), it is proposed that, through examining symbolism in the painting and examining Dutch social and political history in the era, the painting reveals that the men in the painting are covering up a murder. Furthermore, because of his attempt to uncover the murder (and discovering the other bad things the people in the painting were up to) his career was destroyed because of it and the scandals of his personal life (and not just gradually deteriorated because of changes in art taste...and the scandals of his personal life).  This is then supplemented with more detail in the documentary (and better explained in the documentary than it is in the film).  While the insights into Dutch history are very useful and informing (even including minor aspects only somewhat related to Rembrandt, like Dutch anti-Catholicism in relation to art of the era), the simple matter is that much of what is claimed in terms of the original people in the painting and the supposed bad (and controversial) reception of the painting never happened (which plays a big role in the whole concept of this film and documentary).  There are smaller errors by the film on occasion, such as featuring the hills of the Netherlands (which, if you've been there, you'll understand why that's wrong) and how framing the film like the paintings of Rembrandt creates some inaccuracies of how rooms/buildings looked historically (since how a picture is framed for the sake of art can result in messing up what the historical reality was).  Towards the end, the concept of visual literacy is also addressed. \n\nThe host is able to discuss all this while in the Netherlands, visiting Rembrandt's home and the museum where the famous painting is located.  In the process, he also gives little tidbits about being raised as a teenager in the Netherlands (he lived in Washington D.C. at the time of this review's creation and currently lives in New York City).  Like his other episodes, Kyle Kallgren's work if full of humor and funny censor bars for nudity.  Enjoy!\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/273d0k/a_forward_from_grandma_claims_that_the_republican/",
        "text": "So then. A friend of mine linked me to [this image](http://i.imgur.com/6qIBxFL.jpg) on Skype this evening, with the context that this was posted on the subreddit /r/ForwardsFromGrandma. \n\nTranscript for those who don’t wish to open images or can’t:\n\n&gt; Franklin: The Republican Party is racist.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: The Republican Party was founded in 1854 to abolish slavery.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: The Democrat Party founded the KKK and started Jim Crow laws.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: The Democrats opposed integration and Civil Rights for 100 years.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: Traditionally and historically, the Democrats thrive on racism.\n\n&gt; Franklin: YOU’RE a racist.\n\nWell then. Let’s nitpick this a bit.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: The Republican Party was founded in 1854 to abolish slavery.\n\nTechnically, no, the Republican Party was not founded in 1854 to abolish slavery.\n\nNow, the coalition that would eventually become the Republican Party began to organize 20 March 1854. That much is true, and the first statewide convention to nominate people to the party platform began 6 July of that same year. \n\nHowever, the party was not actually founded to abolish slavery.\n\n&gt; [[The new Republican candidates] declared their new party **opposed to the expansion of slavery into new territories**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party#Organizational_beginnings_.281854.29)\n\n-\n&gt; [A small group of dedicated abolitionists gathered **to fight the expansion of slavery**, and they gave birth to a Party dedicated to freedom and equal opportunity.](http://www.gop.com/our-party/our-history/)\n\n-\n&gt; [In Ripon, Wisconsin, former members of the Whig Party meet to establish a new party **to oppose the spread of slavery into the western territories**.](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/republican-party-founded)\n\n-\n&gt; [The party's founders totally opposed slavery. **The platform adopted at the party's first national convention in 1856 rejected the Southern position that Congress had the right to recognize slavery in a territory. The Party maintained that Congress could abolish slavery in the territories and ought to do so.**](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_org_republican.html)\n\nOpposing the expansion of slavery is not actually the same thing as wanting to abolish slavery. It’s a small nuance, but a very important one—the historical Republican Party was not initially founded because they wanted to get rid of slavery in the United States. Rather, they didn’t want the institution of slavery to spread to the new territories and create more slave states. These are two VERY different things. The claim is misleading at best.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: The Democrat Party founded the KKK […]\n\nThe Democrat Party did not find the KKK.\n\nNow, the Ku Klux Klan basically existed in three different stages: the one founded immediately after the Civil War and during the Reconstruction Era, the one founded in the 1920s after *The Birth of a Nation*, and the one made up of individual independent local groups during the Civil Rights era.\n\nThe first incarnation of the KKK was founded by a group of Confederate veterans who were reacting against Reconstruction policies in the South. But who were the people underneath the Klan mask?\n\n&gt; [Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack vigilante groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime guerrilla bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, sadists, rapists, white workmen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and Democratic, was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#First_Klan_1865.E2.80.931874)\n\nThe party was overwhelmingly white, Southern, and Democrat. This does not mean that the Democratic Party founded the KKK. Correlation does not imply causation, after all. \n\nThe second Klan was founded in 1915 by William J. Simmons in Atlanta (and not the Democratic Party). Who did this particular incarnation of the KKK consist of?\n\n&gt; The second Klan expanded with new chapters in the Midwest and West, where for a time, its members were courted by both Republicans and Democrats. The KKK state organizations endorsed candidates from either party that supported its goals; Prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the Midwest.\n\nThe Klan in this incarnation cared more about achieving its goals (that being anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, anti-communist, and even pro-temperance) than about political lines.\n\nIn fact, the Democratic Party split over this incarnation of the KKK in 1924:\n\n&gt; [At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, a resolution denouncing the Ku Klux Klan was introduced by forces allied with Al Smith and Oscar W. Underwood in order to embarrass the front-runner, William Gibbs McAdoo. After much debate, the resolution failed by a single vote. The KKK faded away soon after, but the deep split in the party over cultural issues, especially Prohibition, facilitated Republican landslides in 1920, 1924, and 1928.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party#Bryan.2C_Wilson.2C_and_the_Progressive_Era:_1896.E2.80.931932)\n\nThe third incarnation of the Klan was less of an incarnation of an entire nationwide organization (as it was during the second incarnation of the Klan) and more like a moniker taken up by a number of individual groups in the South during the 1950s and 1960s to oppose civil rights legislation. Some of these organizations would ally with the state government. Others would work independently to terrorize civil rights activists and blacks.\n\nAlthough the group was majority Democrat in many of its incarnations, it would be a mistake to claim that the Democrat Party founded the KKK. Such a claim is, well, utterly wrongheaded.\n\n&gt; Charlie Brown: The Democrats opposed integration and Civil Rights for 100 years.\n\nCorrection: *Southern* Democrats as a whole opposed integration and Civil Rights.\n\nI’m citing part of /u/Samuel_Gomper’s [post in /r/AskHistorians](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yczua/can_someone_address_a_brief_history_of_democrats/c5ui4pm):\n\n&gt; Roosevelt was the first Democrat to win greater than 50 percent of the black vote. He actually won 71 percent in 1936 compared to under 50 in 1932. He consistently appointed people like Harold Ickes, who had previously been president of the Chicago NAACP, to positions of immense importance (Ickes was Secretary of the Interior and ran the PWA, both of which were a gigantic part of the New Deal). Ickes established a quota system in parts of the PWA which he felt were ignoring his orders not to discriminate and issued the first prima facie definition of race discrimination in order to ensure blacks had a fair chance at relief work. This was consistent with Roosevelt's 1932 campaign statement to a large black audience in Detroit that, \"I believe in equal economic and legal opportunity for all groups, regardless of race, color or creed.\" Another major program, the CCC, was almost 10 percent black, proportionate with national demographic percentages. At the 1936 DNC, the party seated black delegates for the first time ever and had a black clergyman deliver an invocation despite the walk-outs of a few Southern senators.\n\n&gt; Roosevelt continued his close relationships with blacks throughout his administration and was also the first Democrat to come out against the poll tax. He routinely met with Walter White, president of the NAACP, and A. Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, on issues of race (one of those meetings led to Roosevelt issuing an executive order against discrimination in any company that received defense contracts; it also created the first Fair Employment Practices Commission). Roosevelt also was fond of visiting places like Fisk University and Atlanta University (though not as often as Eleanor), and speaking to majority black crowds, which was unprecedented. A contemporary editorial in the Baltimore Afro-American said that he set, \"an example of interracial behavior unprecedented in recent memory.\" Many of the new agencies Roosevelt created, moreover, had \"racial advisers\" appointed. This was the first time there was a significant base of black power in Washington (they met occasionally and were called by some the \"black cabinet\") since Reconstruction. We can go all the way to 1944 and see Roosevelt's intention to include blacks in the new economic order he was trying to create, e.g. this excerpt from his 1944 State of the Union:\n\n[Truman would later abolish racial discrimination in US Armed Forces, ending racial segregation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9981)\n\nI could probably also go over how the modern day parties are not the same as their historical counterparts, but honestly, I’m tired and I have classes to attend tomorrow. \n\nMistakes? Leave a comment!\n\n---\nEdit: initially misidentified a Peanuts character (grumble). Should be fixed now.",

        "text": "An excellent series on the internet called \"Brows Held High\" (that reviews things that could be considered \"art house film\") decided to take a month (starting from Shakespeare's birthday) to review content that is Shakespearean.  It decided to cap off that month with a review of \"Anonymous\" - the film of 2011 made by Roland Emmerich.  The film does not present that the idea of Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare as an unproven theory.  The film is the definition of bad history,  since it espouses these Anti-Stratfordian ideas in an extreme way.      \n      \nhttp://blip.tv/brows-held-high/shakespeare-month-anonymous-6896889  \n \nThe host of the show, Kyle Kallgren, explains explores not just the film, but what are Anti-Stratfordians (who don't believe that Shakespeare wrote the works of Shakespeare, but surely someone else did who was more highly educated), their background, the claim of the Earl of Oxford wrote Shakespeare's works, and some of the holes in their theories.  He mentions interesting aspects in this issue, including why there is so little handwritten documentation from/on Shakespeare from the era, the problems of speculating on who a author is based on works of fiction they wrote, mentions the role of the \"Religion of Humanity\" in all this Anti-Stratfordian work, notes the way plays of the era worked/were written, explains the idea that some Anti-Statfordians believe Queen Elizabeth wasn't a virgin (which is depicted in the movie), and poses a potential explanation as to why Emmerich and Anti-Stratfordians really strive to believe in these ideas about who really wrote Shakespeare.      \n       \nAfter getting familiar with this group over the past few days, and seeing the film reviews (and seeing some of the insane theories presented about Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth), I figured it would be something you all would be interested in - plus would be something different for you all (how often do you get visuals at this scale along with your reviews at r/badhistory?).

[Original Post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2718ba/living_in_salt_lake_city_this_makes_me_very_happy/chwi29q) is here, but fair warning it's a cesspool:\n\n&gt;Catholicism in particular made great effort to obscure their early history and falsify records. We don't really have evidence for their origins. Although of course these days this is much harder to do and therefore we know for example they were on the side of the nazis.\nIndeed, today it is much harder for any religion to hide their less savoury sides.\n\nAside from viewing Catholics as one congealed blob of ardent Nazi supporters, this is just wrong on its face. At worst, the official doctrine of the Catholic Church went from wary acceptance to outright denouncement, as seen here in [Mit Brenneder Sorge](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_14031937_mit-brennender-sorge_en.html) which was written by the friggin' Pope of all people. Here's one of the less flowery and \"Holy shit I hope the Nazis don't see this\" sections of the encyclical: \"The experiences of these last years have fixed responsibilities and laid bare intrigues, which from the outset only aimed at a war of extermination. In the furrows, where We tried to sow the seed of a sincere peace, other men - the \"enemy\" of Holy Scripture - oversowed the cockle of distrust, unrest, hatred, defamation, of a determined hostility overt or veiled, fed from many sources and wielding many tools, against Christ and His Church. They, and they alone with their accomplices, silent or vociferous, are today responsible, should the storm of religious war, instead of the rainbow of peace, blacken the German skies.\" (http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_14031937_mit-brennender-sorge_en.html)\n\n&gt;No. The very first treaty Hitler made when in power was with the catholic church. The SS made an oath on god and Hitler. The SS belt buckles stated: Gott mitt uns (god with us).\nThe catholic church was balls-deep in cahoots with facism. Their official doctrine of anti-semitism was not repealed until the 1960's.\nLearn some history before you call something dumb, you really just made yourself look incredibly ignorant there.\n\nHere we learn that the SS using the phrase \"Gott mit uns\" (Which was used on German armor in the [First World War](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/WW_I_Prussian_enlisted_man%27s_belt_buckle_front.JPG) and has been around at least long enough for [Frederick I of Prussia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Preussen1709.jpg) to put it on his coat of arms in 1701) is hard evidence of the support of the Catholic church, as opposed to just being one of a million things used to make soldiers feel better about going into battle. Addressing the treaty, I can only guess he's referring to the Reichskonkordat, which basically just said \"Hey we won't screw with the Catholic Church\" and was almost immediately [broken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat) anyway. But you know, history doesn't real when the two biggest boogiemen on the internet decide to hold hands!\n\nSorry in advance for the handful of Wikipedia links, Catholic History isn't exactly my area of expertise. If anybody wants to shed a little more light on this I'd be grateful.\n\nEDIT: I forgot the other \"balls deep\" comment!\n\n&gt;Of course it is when the catholic church was balls-deep in cahoots with fascism in Italy and Germany. The entire notion of anti-semitism is catholic in nature. I simply don't believe that what you said happened and if it appears so then it is a later attempt at covering up.",

        "text": "Some of you may be familiar with my first post on this matter, which was made [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/26wp0c/the_enigma_of_hitler_when_nazis_write_history/), anyways this is the second of the three \"essays\" written by former Waffen-SS member Leon Degrelle, who planned to put a bunch of them in book before he died. The first one dealt with Hitler, and this one does to some extent, but it also covers the rise of the Waffen-SS. The article is [here](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v03/v03p441_Degrelle.html)\n\nAfter some more background on Leon Degrelle, we are treated to this lovely quote\n\n&gt; The one million-strong Waffen SS represented the first truly European army to ever exist.\n\nSo this is the first really problematic assertion. This ignores two facts. One that the Waffen-SS was intended to serve Adolf Hitler/the Nazis directly and by extension Germany. Can it really be said that they were fighting for Europe when the goal of the Waffen-SS was to fight for the man who had dragged Europe into war and occupied over half of the bloody continent? And secondly, if we are counting multi national armies, wouldn't that honor go to the Grand Armee or the French Foreign Legion? The Grand Armee had about 300,000 foreign members, shouldn't they count.\n\nJust look at the oath the SS had to swear.\n\n&gt; \"I vow to you, Adolf Hitler, as Führer and chancellor of the German Reich loyalty and bravery. I vow to you and to the leaders, that you set for me, absolute allegiance, till death. So help me God!\"\n\nThat's hardly a European Army.\n\nNow we get past the opening and into the main body of Degrell's speech, and run head long into this\n\n&gt; Hitler rose to the chancellorship democratically, winning at the ballot box\n\nIt is true that in the 1932 elections the Nazis won the largest amount of seats, but Hitler was appointed Chancellor by Paul Von Hindenburg at the urging of Franz Von Papen, himself a former chancellor. Papen believed Hitler could be controlled and that is really the only reason Hitler gained power. Now maybe Degrelle is referring to the 1933 elections? Lets see what Richard J. Evans has to say on the matter of the 1933 elections\n\n&gt; Hitler had called for 5 March. Amidst massive Nazi propaganda, paid for by an inflow of fresh funds from industry, and violent intimidation, in which most rival political meetings were banned or broken up, the Nazis still failed to achieve an overall majority, peaking at 44 per cent and only getting over the 50 per cent barrier with the help of their conservative Nationalist coalition partners. The Communists still won 12 per cent and the Social Democrats 18 per cent, with the Centre Party holding firm at 11 per cent of the vote.\n\nThis of course not including the mass arrests of Communists and Social Democrats that occured after the Reichstage Fire.\nMoving on we get to this little gem.\n\n&gt; Later he succeeded always through the electoral process in increasing his majority. When some elections gave him up to 90% of the vote, Hitler earned every vote on his own merit\n\nThis is referring to the elections of November, 1933, its true that Hitler earned 90% of the vote, its also true that he was the only mainstream candidate as every other party had been banned.\n\nAfter this we get more Hitler hero worship, a brief history of the SA and a little blurb about the death of Ernst Rohm.\n\n&gt; The showdown resulted in the death of Roehm, either by suicide or murder\n\nGotta love how the Night of the Long Knives is referred to as a \"Showdown\". Assassinating your political opponents is now considered a \"fight\". Also for anyone who is curious, Rohm was murdered.\nSo after this we get *gasp* more fucking Hitler worship. More Hitler saved the economy bullshit, its been done to death so lets move on.\n\nFinally we get to something that is actually about the fucking Waffen-SS\n\n&gt; Hitler was opposed to any war, particularly in Western Europe. He did not even conceive that the SS could participate in such a war. Above all the SS was a political force\n\nFirst off you have to love the laughable assertion that Hitler was opposed to war. The man literally wrote a book about his plan to conquer land. Lets once again quote Richard J Evans on the matter\n\n&gt; The area in which Hitler took the most consistent and most detailed interest, however, was undeniably that of foreign policy and preparation for war. It was without question Hitler, personally, who drove Germany towards war from the moment he became Reich Chancellor, subordinating every other aspect of policy to this overriding aim and, as we have seen, creating a growing number of stresses and strains in the economy, society and the political system as a result. The war he envisaged was to be far more extensive than a series of limited conflicts designed to revise the territorial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. On one of many similar occasions, he announced on 23 May 1928 that his intention was ‘to lead our people into bloody action, not for an adjustment of its boundaries, but to save it into the most distant future by securing so much land and ground that the future receives back many times the blood shed. He did not modify this intention after he came to power\n\nThe other problematic assertion in Degrelle's statement is the idea that Hitler wanted the SS to stay involved in politics. Hitler had no strong opinion either way. It was Himmler who wanted the SS to stay completely under his control in the political sphere. It was people like Sepp Dietrich and Paul Hausser that convinced Hitler that there should be a separate branch of the SS dedicated to combat, and Hitler loved the idea. To quote Sepp Dietrich\n\n&gt; The concentration camps were run entirely by Himmler's Special SS police and guards and took a very different line to our own development. I met my like-minded colleagues and we did our best to further our ends in organizing a new model army. This came about very gradually and despite Himmler's desire to reserve them as political troops. Even after they were fully organized into regiments and began to receive military training Himmler still tried to usurp them for his own ends.\n\nDegrell than goes on a political rant about the dangers of Communism\n\n&gt; This is a dramatically new factor. This policy of world conquest is still being carried out today whether in Vietnam, Afganistan, Africa or Poland. At the time it was an entirely new concept. Alone among all the leaders of the world Hitler saw this concept as an equal threat to all nations.\n\nYes Hitler saw it all, Hitler is literally Miss Cleo.\n\n&gt; Now in the summer of 1939 the governments of Britain and France were secretly negotiating a full military alliance with the Soviet Union. The talks were held in Moscow and the minutes were signed by Marshal Zhukov.\n\nIt is true that the Soviets and the Western Allies were in talks, but they were hardly on the verge of signing some full on military alliance. Also considering that one of Allies' main goals was a preservation of Poland, I doubt they were just going to offer it to Stalin on a sliver plate. Not to mention part of the reason Stalin signed the non-aggression pact with Hitler was that the Western allies were not willing to negotiate.\n\nSkipping ahead some more we arrive at the invasion of Poland. And dam there is a lot of Bad History here.\n\n&gt; Of all the crimes of World War Two, one never hears about the wholesale massacres that occurred in Poland just before the war. I have detailed reports in my files documenting the mass slaughter of defenseless Germans in Poland\n\nIts is certainly true that on the outbreak of war between Germany and Poland that the Polish government, fearing sabotage, arrested a large amount of ethnic Germans and marched them East. Around 2000 people died in these marches. There is also the famous \"Bloody Sunday\" when 300 ethnic Germans were killed in a failed uprising against the Polish state.\nI'd hesitate to call that \"wholesale slaughter\". It was an unfortunate event, but the brutality is totally outclassed by what the Nazis would soon do to Poland.\n\n&gt; The Polish campaign showed Hitler to be a military genius. History had already started to recognize this most startling of Hitler's characteristics: his rare military genius. All the successful military campaigns of the Third Reich were thought out and directed by Hitler personally\n\nThe invasion of Poland was the brain child of the OKH and Walter Von Brauchitsch. It gets even worse I'm afraid.\n\n&gt; The story goes that Hitler had nothing to do with this operation; that it was all the work of General von Manstein. That is entirely false. Marshall von Manstein had indeed conceived the idea but when he submitted it to the joint Chiefs of Staff he was reprimanded, demoted and retired to Dresden. The General Staff had not brought this particular incident to Hitler's attention. On his own, Hitler ran a campaign along the same lines and routed the British-French forces. It was not until March 1940 that von Manstein came into contact with Hitler.\n\nThis a complete fabrication. Hitler, while not happy with the original general staff plan, was wiling to accept it. Manstein had conceived the plan to cut through the Ardennes, the plan was only accepted after he proposed it to Hitler. Hitler played no role in actually designing the plan. But apparently he was a military genius for going \"I like that, let's do that plan\".\n\n&gt; Hitler also planned the Balkan and Russian campaigns. On the rare occasions where Hitler allowed the General Staff to have their way, such as in Kursk, the battle was lost.\n\nAgain Hitler had no role in actually planning the military side of Operation Barbarossa, at this stage Hitler's MO was still to give basic goals and allow his generals to figure out how to reach them.\nAfter that it turns into a general history of the Waffen-SS and more bizarre Hitler fantasies, but I've covered the bulk of the Bad History here.",

        "text": "Full thread [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/26kgg9/do_you_ever_wonder_how_advanced_we_could_be/)\n\n[Top comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/26kgg9/do_you_ever_wonder_how_advanced_we_could_be/chrw6e9)\n\n&gt;The burning of the Library of Alexandria, the active destruction of pre christian philosophy, and the excommunication, torture and execution of those who practiced the sciences. Who knows what the world would look like if religion didn't exist.\n\nI'll skip the \"DAE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA\"-part... \n\nActive destruction of pre-christian philosophy: I'm pretty sure the Catholic church failed miserably hard at actively destroying pre-christian philosophy, since Roman temples are still pretty visible in .... Rome... and since a lot of people still study Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle.\n\nAlso note how christianity apparently holding back le science in Europe somehow stopped the advancement of the entire world.\n\n**Torture and execution of those who practiced the sciences**: Ever since that episode by the new Cosmos series, edgy edgy atheists have been yelling \"DAE GIORDANO BRUNO???? CATHOLIC CHURCH LITERALLY HATES SCIENTISTS!\". Except that he was burned for his heretic beliefs, and not for his \"heliocentrism\". Not that that's any better, but still.\n\nYou know who else defended heliocentrism about a hundred years before Bruno? Copernicus. How did the catholic church react to that?\n\n&gt;In 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered a series of lectures in Rome outlining Copernicus' theory. Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals heard the lectures and were interested in the theory. On 1 November 1536, Cardinal Nikolaus von Schönberg, Archbishop of Capua, wrote to Copernicus from Rome:\n\n&gt;Some years ago word reached me concerning your proficiency, of which everybody constantly spoke. At that time I began to have a very high regard for you... For I had learned that you had not merely mastered the discoveries of the ancient astronomers uncommonly well but had also formulated a new cosmology. **In it you maintain that the earth moves; that the sun occupies the lowest, and thus the central, place in the universe... Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject ...**\n\n-  Cardinal Nikolaus von Schönberg, Archbishop of Capua\n\nOh, and his book was actuall dedicated to Pope Paul III .\n\nBut that was just the top comment, rest can't be that bad right? I'm sure the child comments will point out the massive amounts of bullshit:\n\n&gt;Along with that, **Christian monks had scraped off the ink of the paper that had contained many different works from many different scientists of the ancient world just to get the paper to write out Bibles**. New techniques in light exposure using different wavelengths allow us to see what was originally written on the papers.\n\n&gt;Apparently, one paper that was so destroyed contained works of Archimedes, including INTEGRAL CALCULUS FROM THE 3RD CENTURY BC. Yes, apparently Archimedes had discovered integral calculus a full 2000 years before Isaac Newton did, and the fucking Christians in power during the Dark Ages fucking ruined that for everyone. We are 2 full millennia behind where we should be as a species in mathematics thanks to Christianity.\n\n\n&gt; http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/inside-archimedes-palimpsest.html\n\nAll of my what? Just to make this clear: the guy is claiming christian monks literally scraped the ink of scientific books in order to make bibles out of that paper..... Just to clarify: monks actually did this, but not to \"turn scientific books into bibles\". Paper was scarce, and this practice was called making [palimpsests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest). Works that were found using palimpsests:\n\n&gt;The Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus: portions of the Old and New Testaments in Greek, attributed to the 5th century, are covered with works of Ephraem the Syrian in a hand of the 12th century.\n\nYeah, it definitely sounds like the catholic church would deliberately destroy a 700 year old bible! Monks transcribed old works when they thought they were obsolete.\n\nThis part was especially beautiful:\n\n&gt;Apparently, one paper that was so destroyed contained works of Archimedes, including INTEGRAL CALCULUS FROM THE 3RD CENTURY BC. Yes, apparently Archimedes had discovered integral calculus a full 2000 years before Isaac Newton did, and the fucking Christians in power during the Dark Ages fucking ruined that for everyone.\n\nIgnoring the \"dark ages\" part and the blatant chartism, this impeccable logic assumes that one monk transcribing \"integral calculus\" [*1600 years after it was written*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest) is the sole reason why this work never became public...\n\nAnd it completely ignores that without christianity this work would've been lost a long time ago:\n\n&gt;At some time in the distant past, the Archimedes manuscript had lain in the library of Mar Saba, near Jerusalem, a monastery bought by the Patriarchate in 1625.\n\nOh, and who rediscovered it?\n\nA biblical scholar...\n\n&gt;The Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf visited Constantinople in the 1840s, and, intrigued by the Greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest, brought home a page of it. (This page is now in the Cambridge University Library.) \n\nThankfully the OP of that comment explains his logic a bit further:\n\n&gt;I'm not talking about the church being the only reason for our lack of progress, but they're certainly a huge part since they were in complete control of Western civilization for about a thousand years. That period is now known as the Dark Ages for a reason. And the biggest deniers of change and progress in western civilization are almost invariably right wing Christians. I'll say what I said to another comment.\n\n&gt;We are sorta 2 millennia behind, because humankind had access to calculus since the 3rd century BC when Archimedes discovered and developed it. **The church destroyed his last copy of it in the 13th century, and we had to wait until the 17th century, a full 400 years, before Isaac Newton discovered the patterns again. During that 400 year span, no one would have ever been able to learn that these patterns of mathematics even existed and the idea was lost completely to human kind. An idea that we take for granted now thanks to Isaac Newton in the 17th century was actually from 2000 years before him.** And it was entirely the church's fault. We know that it was the church's fault. If the writings had survived, something else may have happened to it, but something might not have, and people in the 13th-17th centuries maight have been able to build up something new from that. But we'll never know because the church took it upon itself to destroy it and other works of math, science, and engineering while it was in control of western civilization, forcing us as a species to start over and rediscover an idea that's from 3rd century BC.\n\n&gt;Yeah, modern examples include climate change deniers, but those politicians do not have the power to wipe the idea of climate change from human existence. They can't stop independent research on climate change, they can't erase the internet, and they can't destroy the millions of copies of research articles already written about the subject. All they can do is stick they fingers in their ears and shout lalalalalalala, and try to convince anyone ignorant enough to do the same. Even book burnings don't have the power to erase ideas since the advent of the printing press. But what the church did during the Dark Ages, before we could make copies of books lightning fast, cost human kind thousands of years of previously discovered ideas, whether because they destroyed works for their papers or because \n\n&gt;Christians saw anything not related to God as blasphemy, hence destroying the work out of spite.\nBy the way, of those listed book burnings in your link, I found that the majority of the events conducted after ancient times were conducted by Christians. Muslims tired getting in on the fun, but after the first expansion of the Caliphate they mostly chilled out with that until modern history with terrorist groups. It was only from the time of the last century or so that you begin to see political groups in western society making up reasons other than heresy to burn books, according to that list.\n\n&gt;Like you said, there are people who will always fight progress and reason at every turn, but for a good thousand years of human history the Christians in charge of Western civilization made destroying anything not Christian a public policy during a time when there was no way to disseminate work so easily. We're largely safe from that kind of manic fervor now thanks to the internet and printing presses, but it is still Christianity that motivates a large amount of this rabid destruction of information even today, if not the politicians then the people who vote for them.\n\nSo there you have it: a monk transcribing a text 1700 years after it was written and 400 years before Newton \"invented calculus\", somehow caused a \"2000 year setback in our progress\". That poor monk must feel awful if he'd know what he caused.\n\nOh, and the chart was unironically [posted](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/26kgg9/do_you_ever_wonder_how_advanced_we_could_be/chs37ci) [three](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/26kgg9/do_you_ever_wonder_how_advanced_we_could_be/chs2xlo) [times](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/26kgg9/do_you_ever_wonder_how_advanced_we_could_be/chs2iak)\n\n\nEDIT: kudos for /u/timoneill to actually try and discredit some of the badhistory in that thread.\n\n\n",
