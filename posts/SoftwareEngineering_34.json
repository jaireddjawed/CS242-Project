The question has most probably been answered, yet I wasn't able to get/find any answers for it on Google.\n\nI am starting my first year at the University, and I thought maybe someone could tell me which OS/Laptop is recommended for software engineer student to pick up who are thinking about having a laptop not only for Uni, but also for their future works (so it's kind of an investment at a high price tag that actually lasts). (I would definitely be coding for web, android, ios in the very near future)\n\nI know that Linux is great for Web based content, Windows for everything except to develop for iDevices, and Mac is great for everything pretty much as it uses Unix/Linux and it lets you develop for most of the popular OSs and devices.\n\nMy first thought was a Macbook, but looking at the price, would it really be worth getting a Mac or go for a Windows laptop saving a couple hundreds of pounds? I require portability, performance, professionalism and compatibility. Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a junior full stack C# developer that has been working for two companies over the course of two years. While they differ in size, both companies I have worked for had large systems full of new code and lots of horrifying legacy code. Both use agile development and during each sprint, I would be assigned some task that would either be fixing an existing bug, adding some new feature for a client, or tweaking some existing feature\n\nHere is my problem: \nIt seems that I spend my entire time asking questions (primarily on where things are). In both locations I have been informed that I ask too much and that I need to figure things out on my own. \n\nThe thing is, I will spend hours on a task before breaking down and asking a more senior coworker for help accomplishing said task. 9 times out of 10, it seems like the solution is based on some part of the system that I am completely unaware of and I would have never found on my own (ex: the data is being stored in a db whose existence I am unaware of or there is a js script contained in a non js file which is modifying things and therefore will never be found through chome dev tools debugging, etc.). I almost always end up being informed that despite covering the page with break points and tracing code in and out of files that I am looking in the wrong place.\n\nI've started to feel like I am a trash developer  because I spend 90% of my time simply trying to find the relevant code and only 10% of my time actually coding. \n\nI worry about my future. I can't imagine being able to stay like this much longer, since there is only so long I feel like I can classify as a \"junior\" dev.\n\nI'm the bread winner between me and my significant other and I feel like I am failing them because I seem to lack the ability to become competent.\n\nI understand some of my issues is that I am a junior developer. Some of issue is also my current company is very unprofessional and lacks any kind of testing framework for their code or any significant documentation (I have written the majority of their wiki). \n\nStill, I feel like the main issue is myself. Am I just not cut out for software engineering? I want to succeed in this field but as it it is, I currently don't feel like I am.\n\nMy college experience usually focused on creating software which was all self contained. I really struggle dealing with complex systems that have multiple parts.\n\nHow does someone learn to navigate colossal legacy systems (db, code, and web pages)? How does one learn to determine that the error is because of some sql procedure vs coding error vs some bizarre legacy JavaScript? \n\nI will take any and all advice. Please help me. Are there books or classes I can take? Should I cut my losses and look elsewhere for another field and if so, what kind of career future do I have? Is it just a bad company match?\n\nI am really sick of feeling like I am a failure. Please help.\n\nThank you for your time and sorry if this came across as to angsty. Situation has just been getting to me lately.\n\n----Edit----\n\nI want to thank everyone who posted. Hearing that this is something that many are going through or have gone through has restored some of my confidence that things will work out. \n\nThanks to you all, my mood (which was awful Friday) has improved immensely. You all are awesome!",
