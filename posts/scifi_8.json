There's an added dimension: feel like you're living through your favourite scifi novels with these pairings. Which ones would you suggest?\n\n**Neuromancer**. Beer, of course, like [Sapporo](https://www.sapporobeer.jp/english/). Simple and cheap, but also cold and refreshing.\n\n**Hyperion**. If you want to live like Martin Silenus: pre-Big Mistake champagne, like this [Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé](https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/collection/brut-rose).\n\n**Chasm City**. Something from Earth, expensive for Canopy tastes, red &amp; strong in flavour to bite through the Melding Plague dust. I went with one of the Italian Killer B's: [Brunello di Montalcino](https://www.millesima.be/brunello-di-montalcino.html).\n\n**The Reality Dysfunction**. The Night's Dawn trilogy gave us Norfolk Tears, an extraterrestrial botanic delicacy. Hard to get, so I'd go with an easier to obtain [Armagnac Castarède VSOP](https://www.armagnac-castarede.fr/en/blends/4-armagnac-castarede-vsop.html#).\n\n**Anathem**. Brewed by monks, naturally: [Westvleteren 12](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/313/1545/).\n\n**Snowcrash**. What would you drink in your favourite virtual hang-out? Something with the outlandish colour and simple geometry of a [Cosmopolitan](https://www.acouplecooks.com/cosmopolitan-cocktail/) will stand out.",

You either have to create drama by following bad protocols (not leashing someone to the ship during a spacewalk) or you create interpersonal drama that would be considered unprofessional in a real situation.\n\nAnyways, interesting movie, hard to really recommend it.\n\nSharlto Copley (District 9) steals ALL the scenes that he is in as usual but he's barely in the movie.",

        "text": "Finished the book last night. The following is of course just my opinion; it doesn't mean the book is objectively good or bad. As the title says, scores of people love this book.   \n\n\nHowever, I have come round to agreeing with the prevailing opinion of Goodreads reviews that you read Reynolds for the grand, amazing ideas and... not much else. This novel has tonnes of those great ideas but the stuff that is lacking makes me a little angry because of how great this book could have been.\n\n I'll try to make this short so that it's easy to read but I have a lot more thoughts than what I've written here\n\n\\---\n\n* **Flat &amp; underdeveloped characters**. Neither Campion nor Purslane has any unique/easily identifiable personality traits. The closest thing to this is Campion being openly horny for *yet another* clone of himself while being in a relationship *that has quite literally lasted millions of years.* And I'm supposed to root for *this* guy?\n\nNeither of them goes through a character arc. For that you need a start and end point. These two have neither. \n\nBetony and Mezereon, two minor characters, have more personality than our protagonists.\n\nI feel no connection to any of the characters \\[including General Helpful Robot with Formal Speech (Hesperus)\\].  \n\n\n* **Undercooked character interactions**. Campion pursuing Purslane for tens of thousands of years across galaxies is meant to be interpreted as this ultimate romantic gesture.\n\nBut it falls so flat because the book does not make you believe there is anything special about their relationship. Their conversations are dry and nothing of depth is captured in their relationship; there is no nuance (unless of course you consider Campion's horniness again). It's the ultimate violation of \"show, don't tell\".  \n\n\nI'm also not sold on how C &amp; P try to move Heaven and earth for Hesperus, repeatedly explaining their actions with \"Because he's our friend\".  \n\n\n* **Underdeveloped worldbuilding.** Let's list the things that are introduced but not elaborated upon sufficiently:\n\na) Valmik: yes, he's his own character but exists for precisely one reason: to restore Hesperus and become part of him so the plot can proceed. Is there anything about him that is interesting or appealing? Do we get to know his personality, his hopes and dreams? Very little. We do find out about his past and how he's spent his life, but he's there in the book to resurrect Hesperus and that's it.\n\nb) the Vigilance, despite it being one of the most interesting ideas of the book.\n\nc) Hesperus growing a human arm. It's speculated, again very briefly, that he's trying to infiltrate the Vigilance bc they the latter does not admit machines. But again, this is never mentioned again. \n\nd) The Scapers &amp; the Rebirthers. From my understanding, the Scapers apparently move plants/solar systems? I am probably wrong but if this is the case, that's a really cool idea. Why not elaborate on it a bit more? Similarly, what do the Rebirthers do? Do the accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of sun restoration? I can't remember anything implied about them\n\ne) the House of Suns. We find out about their genocide of Gentian line and meet a single member who fails his (and the House's) objective and... that's it? They become a non-factor once Galingale fails. Was it really worth naming your novel about a concept/party that does so little in the book beyond setting the plot in action?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Palatial section**. 80% of this could have been cut and it wouldn't have affected the book in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite my harsh criticism, the book is still a 7/10 because, again, the ideas are amazing. Reynolds just needs to take book writing classes.",

        "text": "I always held Sci-Fi sub genres that are usually restricted to earth in a near-future setting like Cyberpunk in high regard. However, Space Sci-Fi is what everyone thinks of when they hear the term and honestly, it's not the best of what the genre has to offer imo\n\nAll Space Sci-Fi settings are almost exactly the same and none of them make any attempts to switch up the formula. They always have Warp drive/another fancy name for FTL travel. They always have one governmental system for planets (which destroys all the nuance of a sentient society). They always have the same aesthetics of gray and blue spaceships, etc etc\n\nAs for Space War series, the battles are nowhere near as intriguing and interesting or dramatic as boots on ground battles you'd see in Earth settings. They just have a bunch of commanders in a ship in the middle of nowhere throwing lasers at each other. \n\nYou don't get to see the brutality of warfare, because everything is toned down to just explosions at worse and the only characters that can be fleshed out are the commanders, because only they can have relevance since either the Frontline offense are just robot soldiers, or the Frontline offense are piloting an attack ship which will eventually get old since the only aesthetical setting used is either space (just a black atmosphere full for white stars) or it would be hovering above a planet shooting lasers (which they have to be committing war crimes by killing thousands of innocent civilians in the process)\n\n\nWhen every planet only has one government, then every planet is just an oversized country and as I said it destroys the idea of a whole planet full of billions of sentient aliens with their own ideologies, morals and ethics being able to all get along and create ONE SYSTEM THAT MEETS EVERYONE'S IDEALS. One race planet systems are also weird, because for something as big as a planet there's no way they could be restricted to just one race. The United States is a massive country nowhere near as big as Earth, yet it has the most diversity of any country! Our native race/nationality is a minority!\n\nPlanets in space Sci-Fi are usually used as a way to create fantasy-like atmospheres and themes like a Lava planet, an ice planet, etc. The problem is none of these themes take advantage of the infinite possibilities of space! Space can be anything we imagine! Space could have new elements, new matter, new anything! Yet they stick to earthly climates like cold, hot, and Earth-likes?\n\n\nTechnologies in Space Sci-Fi makes the setting have less stakes than in more grounded genre. Since it's very very far into the future that means any technology could exist. And because of that there's usually immortality, cloning, time travel, mind control, brainwashing, replacing organic body parts with mechanical ones, etc etc. But when things like this exist it means that if say somebody lost their arm, they could get a perfectly fine replacement and face no actual consequences for losing an arm... If a character is almost dying, they could just be given an injection that heals them and materializes nanobots to repair their injuries. And since it isn't magic it can't have limitations, therefore it functions like magic from a storytelling perspective, yet it doesn't have the limitations that come from it\n\n\nThe biggest problem with space sci-fi is that it's so high scale that it will always feel underdeveloped from a world building perspective, compared to settings like Cyberpunk that can fully flesh out a country or multiple countries and it would be completely fine since you wouldn't expect the ENTIRE earth to be fleshed out. Space settings couldn't give me that satisfaction because even if a story tried fleshing out an entire Solar System, it would either feel undeveloped or just feel like every planet is one-dimensional and the inhabitants are hive-minded. And even if it did flesh out the solar system, it still doesn't live up to what it's meant to be, since most Space settings take place in a whole Galaxy, yet not even 0.0000001% of it is showcased. \n\nAnd that is why I like Cyberpunk and subgenres that place on Earth way more than the typical Space setting. Of course this isn't hating on space settings, just imo I was pretty disappointed when my favorite Sci-Fi game became a formulaic space setting after it was supposed to be different futuristic theming to AVOID becoming Space Sci-Fi... \n\nHowever, Early Space Age (like colonizing Mars or the moon) is awesome. It has all the perks of a galactic scale space setting, with way less of the flaws.",

The fragile specimen had been improperly secured in one of the mass transport’s overhead bins and only the membrane shield she was wearing when it fell had protected her from severe injury. She shifted her head underneath the protective hood and winced as the material rubbed over her antenna tasting of nothing but the synthetic fibers. She tossed the last of the fragments into the carry case and glanced around for any more. She didn’t see any and rose to her full height. She sealed the carry case and watched as Rollstight activated the air filters and the vacuum drone.\n\nWhen the sensors declared the interior of the transport free of the dangerous fragments of volcanic rock Seventh Sister pulled the membrane shield with a flex of relief. She flared out her frill and extended her antenna several times. She shook out all four legs one at a time and was in the process of giving her abdomen a good flex when Rollstight gave a disgruntled hum. Seventh Sister focused her attention on her and smiled as she saw the many appendages struggling to find purchase on the sides of the tank.\n\n“Do you require assistance?” Seventh Sister asked.\n\n“Yes,” Rollstight admitted. “These old isolation tanks were built too large for the median mass Undulate. Could you go fetch Human Friend Mack?”\n\n“I am capable of assisting you myself,” Seventh Sister assured her.\n\nShe tripped lightly up to the tank and offered her forearms as a point of leverage. The Undulate wrapped her gripping appendages around her primary joint politely but seemed hesitant to put any weight on the limb.\n\n“Are you sure you are capable?” Rollstight asked. “I don’t usually climb anyone over Fifth.”\n\n“The strength gradient is negligible between Fifth and Tenth.” Seventh Sister assured her. “And I am well above the mean strength for a Fifth.”\n\n“You are sure of this?” Rollstight pressed. “You are not attempting to prove your usefulness to the collective by risking a stress injury?”\n\nSeventh Sister laid her frill tight against her neck but managed to keep the offense out of her voice.\n\n“I am not a human Rollstight!” she said.\n\nRollstight gave a hum of apology and held out her gripping appendages. Her weight was slightly painful but, as she had predicted, well within the tolerance of Seventh Sister’s joints. When Rollstight was safely on the floor they began to leave together.\n\n“So what did Human Friend Sarah want with those volcanic rocks?” Rollstight asked.\n\n“I am uncertain,” Seventh Sister said. “She said it could be used in a medical application for the problem she is having with her feet.”\n\n“Oh yes,” Rollstight said. “Her outer membrane cracked and was bleeding if I recall correctly.”\n\nSeventh Sister felt a shudder of horror go through her at the cavalier nature of the statement. How could reasonable people be so calm about membrane damage?\n\n“Yes,” was all she said aloud.\n\n“So dose the volcanic action generate the mineral complex she needs?” Rollstight asked.\n\n“I do not think it is a mineral deficiency she is correcting,” Seventh Sister said. “Her instructions focused on the density of the air pockets in the rock and it’s general density.”\n\n“Hey!” a cheerful human voice called out from the corridor ahead. “Is that my pumice?”\n\n“It is Human Friend Sarah,” Rollstight answered. “We were just wondering what you wanted it for.”\n\n“My feet!” Human Friend Sarah said cheerfully. “Got some nasty calluses from all the hiking we’ve been doing and when they split they took some live skin with them.”\n\n“How will these mineral samples help with that?” Rollstight asked. “Will you need access to the mineral grinders?”\n\n“Grinders?” Human Friend Sarah asked. “Nah, they’re small enough now. I just need one flat surface for the abrasion to work.”\n\n“Abrasion?” Seventh Sister asked as Human Friend Sarah took the sample container.\n\nRollstight gave a hum of satisfaction and understanding.\n\n“Well I can’t scrape off all that dead skin with cotton,” Human Friend Said with a shrug. “Thanks for getting these for me. Hope it was no trouble.”\n\nHuman Friend Sarah gave them a friendly wave as she turned and started back down the corridor. Beside Seventh Sister Rollstight lifted several appendages and waved them idly at the Shatar. Seventh Sister shook out her suddenly stiff frill and glanced down at the Undulate.\n\n“Do you have a question Rollstight?” Seventh Sister managed to ask.\n\n“I have never seen your frill quite that color,” Rollstight observed in surprised tones. “What does it indicate?”\n\n“Emotional shock and some horror,” Seventh Sister admitted. “Possibly disbelief and hopefully lack of understanding.”\n\n“Was it something Human Friend Sarah said?”  Rollstight asked.\n\n“She,” Seventh Sister began slowly, dabbing at her eyes rapidly with her proboscis in an attempt to calm herself,  “she implied that she was going to use the jagged surface of the volcanic rock to scrape away the outer layer of her membrane.”\n\n“Yes,” Rollstight agreed. “I should have  been able to surmise.  We do something similar for when our gripping appendages get too rough, but we usually use an abrasive paste. Gripping such a large rock must require gloves if their hands are not equally calloused as their feet.”\n\nSeventh Sister stared down at Rollstight in quiet contemplation. She finally curled her antenna tight to her head and gave her frill a shake.\n\n“I think I need to call my Mother,” she said as she turned and walked down the corridor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!",

        "title": "Uncanny Robot is an audio drama where the scripts are written by AI and performed by humans. More often than not with hilarious results. This is my review.",
        "author": "ArthurDrakoni",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/11boyof/uncanny_robot_is_an_audio_drama_where_the_scripts/",
        "text": "Artificial intelligence has made major advances over the last few years. We’ve seen the rise of predictive text algorithms and even AIs that can generate artwork. But these leaps in technology have many people asking some serious questions. But perhaps the most pressing question of them all is this: can you use an AI to write the script for an audio drama?  Uncanny Robot is an audio drama that attempts to answer this question. \n\nUncanny Robot is an anthology audio drama created by Theresa Matsuura and Rich Pav. The start by taking a story prompt, and feeding them into different predictive text AIs. They then allow the AI to keep going, occasionally stepping in when it gets stuck in a rut, or if they otherwise don’t like the direction things are going. Then, Theresa and Rich record and narrate the insuring story. In more recent episodes, Theresa and Rich take a more hands-on approach to the stories, with the AI as more of a third writer in the room with them. \n\nI must also give a shout out to another podcast that Theresa and Rich work on. Uncanny Japan explores all that is weird from old Japan. Strange superstitions, folktales, cultural oddities, and interesting language quirks, and whatever else Theresa digs-up while researching for her novels and short stories. It is hosted by Theresa, who also does the research, while Rich handles the audio engineering and soundscaping. It isn’t an audio drama, or audio fiction per se, but I still greatly enjoy it. I would encourage everyone to give Uncanny Japan a listen. Well, after you listen to Uncanny Robot, of course. I should probably also mention that Theresa is a Bram Stoker Award nominated author. She has published short story collections such as The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales and A Robe of Feathers and Other Stories. \n\nAs you might expect, the quality of the episodes of Uncanny Robot tend to vary quite a bit.  I’m partial to the earlier episodes, due to the the sheer insanity they had.  One of my favorites was “Elvis Lives.” As the title says, it takes place in a world where Elvis did not die in 1977 at the age of forty-two. We get to learn all sorts of fun facts about Elvis. For example, apparently, his birth name was Ralston Oliver Jones. He was named after his mother’s favorite singer, Billie Holiday. Speaking of his mother, she worked as a dancer at a strip club. Elvis changed his name to Elvis Aaron Presley when he was eight. His family moved to California when he was a teenager, and he attended UCLA. Elvis had a total of twenty-six marriages, and was divorced several times. In 1969, he got a sex change and became known as Pricilla Presley. This probably caused some confusion, as Elvis’ first wife was also named Pricilla.\n\nSome people wonder if it might only be a matter of time before AI get into the story writing business. Some people fear this might lead to human writers getting edged out of the market. Personally, I’m not losing any sleep over the matter. If these episodes are anything to go off of, AI has a long, long way to go before it can seriously challenge human writers. Still, AI are capable of producing some unintentionally hilarious results.\n\nHave you listened to Uncanny Robot?  If so, what did you think?\n\nLink to the full review on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2022/10/the-audio-file-uncanny-robot.html?m=1",
