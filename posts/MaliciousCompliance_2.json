        "text": "To make things short, I am an afab. On top of attending university, I work at an educational center that teaches English as a second language or a foreign language. Not so sure. Anyways, I am a substitute teacher and do other tasks around the place like printing pages or correcting exams and writings. I basically do anything that is asked of me as long as it is within my working hours which are five hours a day, six days a week. Considering I never had any job experience, I would say I get paid relatively okay. I attend classes in the morning and afternoon then go to work in the evening and night.\n\nNow onto my problem that I need malicious help in. I come from a hot country. I am talking about it never goes below 12 degree C. Even 12 is low. The country I am studying and working in goes all the way to -14 degree C. During winter, I needed to wear thermal clothes and layer a lot to say somewhat warm. (I still was cold.) My main outfits consisted of hoodies and comfortable pants since I am spending around 12 hours in them. In late January (early February), my boss who is also the owner asked me if I can wear a bit differently. I said no because it is far too cold and I do not have the clothes for it. She did ask me to leave a top or two in the work closet that I can change into when I get to work. I completely ignored her on that because I do not want to leave clothes overnight let alone change 4 times a day. (get dressed in the morning, then change to work, then change to go home, then undress). I did try to wear 'nicer' clothes and keep my hoodie in my bag because I go home at night which makes it extra cold.\n\nNow that the weather is getting warmer, I am able to dress lighter. I wore a few shirts here and there. Today, I had a graphic t-shirt that had a picture of a race car. The race car is red but everything else is black. I also had make up on. (She compliments my make up everytime which I am assuming in hopes of I wear it more since positive response about something will lead people to do it more.) When she saw me at the end of the day, she asked me if this (warmer weather) means I will wear more formal clothes. I told her but I am just wearing a t-shirt. she said and I quote \"yeah but you look like a rock fan and not a teacher\". I told her I don't really have clothes other than shirts but I will see what I can do with what I have.\n\nI need ideas and help on how I can be \"more formal\" without actually wearing less casual clothes.\n\nPreviously, I tried to just wear a black shirt and black pants. nothing more teacher outfit than that. But I can't do it five days a week. (I do not see her on the 6th day). I am also going to try to wear just one outfit all five days that she sees me in.",

        "text": "I posted this on the AITA sub but many people were saying it is MC and to post it here too. \n\n I (59M) live in a major city in Ontario, Canada. I live in a small subdivision and have 5 neighbors total on my street.\n\nFor the past few years during the winter when we're getting a lot of snow or a bad storms, as I'm leaving for my overnight shift at around 8-9pm I'll put my wifes windshield wipers up on her car and do a quick walk around to my other 5 neighbors and put their windshield wipers up on their cars (obviously not if they're outside or something, but if it looks like they're in for the night). Many of them forget to do this, as many of them have children and it typically slips their mind, and their wipers will be frozen to their car in the morning.\n\nIt's just something nice I like to do to look out for my neighbors. They're all always grateful of this and thank me for it. Many of them started doing it too and there will be nights where I'll forget to put mind and my wifes up, and in the morning one of the neighbors has done it for us.\n\nAnyway recently one of our neighbor's moved and a new family moved in as of last week. It's a young couple and their two young children. The other night I was leaving for my overnight shift at around 9pm. It was snowing really heavy and we were supposed to be getting almost 30cm of snow and it was FREEZING out. So I put my wifes wipers up and do my usual quick walk around to the other neighbors.\n\nI was hesitant when I reached my new neighbors house, as I've only introduced myself once, but did it anyway. As I was putting the second wiper up on their pick up truck the husband came charging out of his front door yelling \"HEY WHAT THE F\\*CK ARE YOU DOING TO MY TRUCK?\" I tried to explain to him I was just putting his wipers up to help him. He continued to scream at me to \"get the hell off my property and don't touch my shit AGAIN!\". The wife then came out and started yelling at me too. I apologized and started walking away. Some of my other neighbors heard the commotion and came outside to see what was happening.\n\nThey tried explaining to him too that it's just something we do, both of them wasn't having it.\n\nFast forward to this morning, I'm arriving home from my overnight shift and as I'm walking in I see the wife of this couple struggling outside to break the ice off the windshield wipers of the truck. Guess she was trying to take her kids to school and the wipers were frozen solid on the car.\n\nShe sees me and yells over \"Hey there! Do you mind giving me a hand please?\" I look over to her and yell back \"No sorry, thought I was to never touch your shit again ma'am\" and walked back inside. She yelled back at me \"wow AH!\".\n\nTold my wife about this, she thinks I should've helped her because she was just trying to get her kids to school. I disagree as I was just following what they told me.",

        "text": "This is a story from one of my college friends, Zack and how he one day decided to jokingly comply with a professor's request only to have it shot right back in his face.\n\nSo for quick background: Zack and I were both students in our university's department for fields such as animation, game design, and film.  Since Zack and I studied similar fields (Zack studied Game Design and I studied Animation), we were both required to take a series of classes called 3D Modeling with a professor I'll call Professor Rick.  Rick was a one-of-a-kind professor who was not only experienced in the field, but also a very understanding and approachable man who knew how to make the subject fun and easy for all of us.  3D Modeling, as you'd probably expect, was a VERY project heavy class.  Each month or so, you'd be assigned a project (let's say for example, the project is a fully detailed and functioning lamp model) which you would work on both in and out of class throughout the month.  You'd also be required to submit your current progress online each week for feedback and an easy A as long as you had shown you were making progress.  Classes would usually be spent talking about the next part of the project and then working on them.  As long as you were actually doing the work, listening to Rick's feedback, and actively improving, the class was an easy A.  Pretty simple, right?\n\nAnyway, the story begins about a week after one of these projects started.  One day, Zack's laptop suddenly had massive technical issues and needed to be repaired.  While he was assured the issue could and would be fixed, he wouldn't be able to get the laptop back before the following week, after the deadline for the upcoming progress report was due.  Not only was this a problem because Zack couldn't access the progress he had already made on the project, but also because these projects required a very specific type of software that you couldn't access on any normal school computer.  These projects also required HOURS to work on, so he couldn't just borrow a laptop to use to finish the project.  So Zack had no choice to talk to Professor Rick about his issue.  Thankfully, Rick understood what was going on because, like any person would in this industry, he knew how unpredictable technology could be and that issues tended to happen.  On top of that, he knew already that Zack had been working on his project in class, so he knew Zack wasn't lying.\n\nSo when Zack asked what he could do for the upcoming progress report, Professor Rick said \"just submit whatever you've got and I'll grade it.  Don't worry about it.\"\n\nNow, Zack knew what Professor Rick PROBABLY wanted.  Since we were required to submit progress reports each week, Zack could have easily used a campus computer to download a previous file and resubmit it with no issue.  However, Zack had another idea.\n\nSee, Zack is a huge fan of dry humor.  So did Professor Rick.  So Zack thought it would be funny to submit something DIFFERENT for Professor Rick instead of what he'd expect.  So he submitted a simple one-page word document with \"Sorry\" in big letters written in the middle.  He then left a comment attached to the submission saying \"Sorry, I didn't think you'd care what I turned in, so I gave you this.\"  Zack then moved on with his day.\n\nProfessor Rick said nothing to him about it and about a week passed.  Like I mentioned before, most of these projects were guaranteed A's, so when Zack saw the notification that the grade was submitted, he didn't think to check right away.\n\nThen, one day, while looking through the app we used to submit our work, he noticed something...off.  His grade for 3D Modeling, which was once an A, was now a C-.  He was completed confused and upon investigating what could be the cause, he noticed one grade that looked VERY different.\n\nThe progress report received a grade of -200/100.  Zack was absolutely stunned.  How the heck was a NEGATIVE score even possible?!  He quickly checked the submission and saw underneath his comment was a reply from Professor Rick that said \n\n\"Sorry, I didn't think you'd care what grade I gave you, so I just gave you this instead.\"\n\nZack panicked, thinking he made Professor Rick angry and as soon as the next class started, he approached the professor with his laptop open to the grade to ask what the heck was happening.  But before he could speak, Professor Rick saw the grade, saw Zack's face, and started laughing.  He laughed HARD.  Zack then realized what was going on and started laughing too.\n\nThe grade was changed to a 100/100 the very next day.  God, I genuinely LOVED my professors.",

        "text": "Before I start: English isn't my first language so sorry about any mistake\n\nIdk why I suddenly remembered this from 2018, but I did and it fits here. Anyway, back then I was waitressing to put a bit of money aside (not in the US, it actually pays a living wage where I'm from). Restaurants are very often chaotic, but man, this one? Ive never seen something quite like it. The owner would come in and tell the customers they were filthy *to their faces*, all the while ignoring the fact that there were rats and roaches crawling in the place. Anyways.\n\nSo one day, after we did diner service, things slow down and for the first time this day I actually have time to go empty and clean my tables. I'm in the front of the outside sitting area, so I start taking some of the water jugs that are on the tables, intending to drop them by the bar as I go fetch my trail. Because you know, an empty voyage is a wasted voyage in this kind of job.\n\nAnd the day manager sees me taking jugs in my hands (like, 3/4 by hand to make the most of it, it didn't look like me being the \"pretend you're busy\" kind of lazy). And he goes red in the face and asks \"what are you doing?? We need to clean the tables so we can sit more people. Leave the water jugs alone and clean the tables.\" I start opening my mouth to say that that's what I'm doing, and that part of getting the tables clean is removing the stuff that's on it, and also that the barman just told me a few minutes ago that he was out of jugs so we couldn't refill people on water. He doesn't let me get a word in, scolds me for even trying to talk back, reiterates \"leave the jugs alone and clean the table!\"\n\nSo that's what I did. I cleaned every item on every table, but left the half emptied jugs on the tables. Half an hour later, I had heard three groups of potential customers pass on us because \"these tables look like there's still someone sitting there\" or because \"look, they can't even get their tables clean and they're barely half full, I don't want to eat here\". That's the time it took for the day manager to realise we had no water jugs anymore to give to people. He was very pissed when I explained why, but he couldn't fire me for following directions (I quit the following week anyway)",

Day started in science class of all places, where were supposed to answer a list of questions on our science book, keep in mind I don’t have a science book with me and were supposed to form groups.  So there’s like 7 members in this group and we need to answer 3 questions, so i told them I’ll write for today our insights, i won't answer the question I’ll just give insights and give the actual writer something they can actually base off of, simple right? They told me they were gonna make a group chat, so fast-forward the period ends and I gave them back the paper to the original writer and the science book i borrowed from them. \n\nThe next day they gave me back the paper with my answers?!, no they didn't give me back the science book so i could keep writing nor did they at least try to answer the questions, they didn't even make a group chat. when i asked them about it i told them im not supposed to be the writer, they still said \"but someone has to write\" all our group members wouldn't help we have 7 members and you're telling me the same dude that tried to do the work day yesterday and doesn't have a science book to even base my information of off that it’s my responsibly to write? Dude no, i set firm boundaries that im only writing for yesterday. None of you people even tried to contact me before hand; you just gave me a piece of paper and decided im the one writing? I tried to give a paper back to them saying \"im not the writer and i don't have a science book with me\" i wait for a reply from my group mates, waited for a while and they gave me back the paper same as before. What am i supposed to do with this, pull the information out of my butthole like its magic? No, so I wasn’t even supposed to answer the paper in the first place, so the paper sat there in my bag while trying to explain my situation to the rest of my group mates, \n\nFast-forward its almost the end of class one of my group mates came up to me and said “hey I have the science book  write everything on here” I answered with “this doesn’t even answer the 3 questions also couldn’t you just find some of our other group members to write”  he replied with “forget about it none of our group members wanted to help” keep in mind this dude was basically just trying to get me to do this whole project without hi m or any of my other group members lifting a finger and what this dude was telling me to write was so wrong it never even answered question 1 correctly, let alone question 2 &amp; 3, so I tell him about this and he told me “we had questions to answer?” so you’re telling me this dude never once checked if we had a format. Cue malicious compliance, I wrote everything he told me and asked one of my other group mates to pass it to the teacher; in a few words she said “like talk about this later”",

At the hospital, there was a constant problem of food being stolen from the employees fridge, there were constant complaints but the administration would just ignore them. One day my husband brought a pot of cream cheese (requeijão)worth 2 reais (about 50 cents) put it in the fridge and when his break came he saw it missing. He went to HR to report the theft and they told him that since it was not hospital property, there was nothing they could do.\n\nMy husband just said “Is that so?” turn around and left. He went to the phone and called the cops asking them to come because there was a theft (he didn’t tell them what was stolen).\n\nNow, private hospitals in Brazil have a big thing about image, so when two cop cars arrived at the front of the hospital everyone, from patients, employees, HR and even the top administration came to see what was going on. \n\nOne of the cops that arrived ended being one of my husband uncle’s so he just went straight to ask him what happened. My husband with the most serious expression just told him, loud enough for everyone to hear, that he wanted to make an official report that someone stole his 50 cent pot of cream cheese. \n\nThere was a general silence before his uncle asked “Are you serious? If I knew this was about a 50c pot of cheese we would not have come, and would have told you to go to the station to make the report if you wanted”, my husband just answered with a smile “I know, that is why I did not say what was stolen and now you have to make the report”, which he did.\n\nObviously the police wouldn’t do anything about it, but because of the whole circus that my husband created, the next week the hospital installed a camera right in front of the employees fridge and the food theft finally stopped.",

We argued and said she wouldn't pick me up food and that I'm entitled and I never help with the groceries so I'm not even helping her.\n\nWelp, I had enough, so went she to her room, I took out all the food I put away into bags and put them in the living room.

        "text": "After I left active duty service, serving onboard a ship, all I wanted to do is drive, so in 1999 I got a driving job delivering meat in Southern California. It was a tough job, dealing with traffic and my schedule was always tight with 16-20 deliveries each day to local markets. \nI was mostly given inner city routes with markets with limited space for mid-size delivery trucks. One of my weekly stop was a small market owned and run by an Iraqi immigrant, I will call him “Ali”, \nAli was always scheduled to be my 5th, or 6th stop and would always complain to me why I would show up that late (after 9 am each time), he said he wanted to the first one of the day. I told him I knew he opened each day after 8:00 am each weekday and that I start my route at about 6:15 am, plus I don’t schedule my route, if he wanted to make sure he was the first delivery of the day, he would have to call “Steve” our delivery route supervisor. \nAli in fact called Steve, because the very next week I received special instructions that read: Make sure Ali’s Market is your first delivery of the day. I had my normal amount of stops that day, about 18 and I knew they all will be pushed back at least 2 hours because I knew Ali won’t open until 8 am and he will not open the rear door until an hour later…the rear door was for deliveries and trash bin access.\nI began driving at my usual time, I arrived at Ali’s market 15 minutes later, Ali’s market is closed, I had my orders, I will make sure Ali’s market is the first one of the day. I park and wait. 8:00 came and Ali shows up, he drives his old Benz around the back of my truck and parks, and walks inside thru the back door. I wait for him to open the front and he ignores me, he was busy pretending to supervise the cashier,intentionally ignoring me, so I walk to the meat counter on the back, the guy tells me he was not allowed to take deliveries, that I had to wait for Mr. Ali. At this point I could have gone to make two or three deliveries and then return, but I had my very specific order. \n\nAs I was walking towards the front to exit the market, I grabbed a newspaper, paid for it, and then told Ali, who was just standing there looking at me, “let me know when you are ready to take your order, you know where I parked.” \nAli didn’t say a word, he was apparently taking revenge for all these years for his small city market not being the #1 priority of a meat distributor who delivered beef, pork, chicken, cheese and other refrigerated products from over 12 distribution points throughout the United States.\nSteve arrived to his desk right after 10 am, the first thing he saw on his computer screen was an alert of my truck sitting inert for 4 hours. He called me all in a rage, demanding I explain to him why my truck was sitting for all that time, I explained that I was following his order to make sure I deliver to Ali’s market first. Steve hanged up and called Ali, whatever Steve told Ali made Ali to get his whinny butt out of his crappy little market and take delivery of his meat order, about 14 boxes of product, if I recall correctly. I then began to rush through the rest of my stops, not wasting time at all and at the end of my day I was the last driver back to the warehouse. I got an extra $80 on overtime because Ali cried for not being the first delivery of the day.\nI never returned to see Ali again, apparently we dropped his whinny butt as a customer.",

This worked for a while but then one day he made me read stories for over 2 ½ hours and was still awake late at night so I had to come up with a plan that didn’t have the chance of hours of story telling. I started telling him we’d read 5 stories and then lights off and time to sleep. Sometimes it would work, and he’d stay in bed and sometimes it wouldn’t he’d be in and out of bed too many times to even count and need more stories to fall asleep. So then I started to tell him that I’d be back in a minute to read the extra stories as I had to do something and that I’d be back. Then in my absence, in the dark (but with night light on) and with his sleepy music on, he’d fall asleep naturally while “waiting” for me even though I was never coming back. \n\nThis worked for a long time until he started asking me where I was going. First time he asked I thought, what would be a place he’d know he couldn’t come with me to? I know, the toilet for a “caca”! This also worked for a good while but then all of a sudden it didn’t and this is where the malicious compliance (of sorts) comes into it.\n\nMe: “Daddy has to leave the room for a minute. I’ll be right back… you stay here. Ok?”\n\nToddler: “Ok. But where you going?”\n\nMe: “I’m going caca. But don’t worry, I’ll be right back in a minute”\n\nToddler: “No. stay.”\n\nMe “I really need to go caca. So I can’t stay. I’ll be right back. Ok?”\n\nToddler “You really need caca?”\n\nMe “Yes. I’ll be right back as soon as I’m done”. \n\nToddler “Ok. Let’s go caca then”\n\nMe “No, you stay here. I’ll go caca on my own and come straight back” \n\nToddler “No. I’ll come with you. Then you can come back to bed with me after”\n\nBasically… this went on for ages. A tug of war, a battle of wills and finally the stronger of the two of us prevailed and the weaker of us gave in. \n\nSo, yes, my toddler escorted me to the toilet like a man with hostage, sat on the step next to the toilet and made me take a shit (that I absolutely didn’t need and had no idea was even there) all the time eyeballing me asking me “You finish caca yet?”\n\nWhen I finally had finished, he escorted me back to his bedroom to carry on reading more stories like I had always said would happen but never did as he’d fall asleep while I was out of the room. \n\nI got my bluff called by my toddler and in a weird way I’m actually proud of him for calling me on my shit. Literally. \n\nAfter that, I never told him I needed a caca ever again.",

        "text": "At my workplace, we have an internal employee site where we can make announcements, post project updates, etc. For each post/comment, you can see the employee's name and a small profile photo.\n\n\nMost profile photos were normal, but it wasn't uncommon for someone's photo to include family, pets, or the person in an \"action\" situation (like skiing or running a marathon, nothing insane). Post-covid, people sometimes started adding other kinds of flair/icons to their photos... Could be a sports team logo, a pride flag, or whatever else. \n\n\nAround election 2020, the situation began escalating... Some people changed their photos to elicit more _charged_ emotions, like black lives matter, blue lives matter, religious symbols, or just straight endorsements for some politician that was *clearly* meant to rile up another group.\n\n\nSince we were just in a state of total \"fuck it\" at this point, a few brave individuals even changed their photos to anime, and one guy who shared a name with a famous person set his photo to a picture of the musician because he thought it was funny. \n\n\nHR stepped in and -- rather than just say \"no political imagery\" (they probably didn't want to bother defining \"political\" and honestly at this point I didn't blame them) -- they made the rule, \"profile photos must be a clear headshot of the employee on a plain background. No other person, animal, flag, or other icon should be visible. You are permitted to wear a hat as long as it is a solid color and abides by other stated guidelines.\"\n\n\nThey *claimed* this was due to people displaying images that did not depict themselves or included a group of people, which made it difficult for people to connect names to faces, but we all knew this was because of the political shitshow happening internally. \n\n\nNext week, cue malicious compliance. The rules did not state that the photo had to be recent. Dozens of employees set their profile photo to be their baby photos. HR must have gotten a kick out of it (and were probably just relieved the internal political war was over) because a couple of them even joined in.\n\n\nAnyway, that's the story of how I worked at a company full of children.",

        "text": "TDLR: Coworker insisted I use his slower method of calculating bills, which led to an excessively long line of customers making payments, as opposed to the usual 1-2 customers I deal with at a time.\n\nHello friends, this is my first post on the Malicious Compliance subreddit. While it may not be as juicy and dramatic as a number of the ones I’ve seen, I just wanted to share something that happened to me today while I was at work.\n\nINFO: This does not take place in the US, Europe, or Australia. This is set in Asia — I won’t clarify where since it’s not important, just wanted to give you guys context.\n\nFor starters, I’m (23) a university student working part time at my aunt’s restaurant to make a little extra mullah before the academic year starts. My job is pretty simple — it’s an all-rounder job where I need to take people’s orders, send tickets to the kitchen, calculate each table’s bills, handle payments and clear tables. TLDR: I’m currently working part-time as a waitress.\n\nI’m only here until the end of this week because I secured another gig elsewhere before the academic year starts, so I figured why not finish this week for a little extra cash before then.\n\nI get along with most of the stuff, all of whom are a decade or so older than me, and said individuals work at the restaurant full time. There’s another part timer (19) who’s working here and he comes to work whenever he’s able since he’s studying too.\n\nHe wasn’t around for a couple of weeks, so I’ve been left to sort out most waitressing matters. My shifts during lunch hour get particularly busy, which is why my system keeping the workflow super smooth is a crucial point to this post. The moment after bills have been settled, tables need to be cleared immediately because new customers come pouring in and some insist on being seated even before the tables have been cleared or wiped down. \n\nI came up with a system in the three weeks that I’ve been working here that works for both myself and my colleagues. Upon receiving tickets for orders that have been received, I always key in their order according to the table they’re sat so that it’s less time consuming in the event other customers want to settle their respective bills. Customers are expected to come to the payment counter when they’re ready to pay, so this system is a lot easier and much more efficient than letting tickets pile up and only calculate the bill right when customers are about to pay (which results in a longer line). I always make it a point to ask customers if their food has all arrived, if they were satisfied with the quality of their order and if they ordered anything else that I hadn’t seen on their tickets. Once they verify their orders are correct, that’s all. I go about my day and mind my business.\n\nThat was until the other part-timer approached me earlier today. His point was an eyebrow raiser, for sure. I’m not the type of person to pick fights or argue, so since he was so insistent that my way of doing things was making it difficult for him to keep track of additional orders at each table, I decided to just let him have at it since he was so happy to tell me how to do my job. I simply smiled and nodded at him, making a beeline to the cleaning supplies and thinking to myself, “You want me to stop punching in people’s orders? Sure thing!”\n\nFor a solid hour or two, I only collected the tickets, bringing them to the cash register and letting them pile up, just as he requested. When I noticed customers stand up from their seats and making their way to the payment counter, I would speedwalk to the cleaning supplies and start collecting plates to show that my hands were occupied and that I wouldn’t be able to sort out people’s bills! I left it all to my dear coworker who tried telling me what to do and how to do it.\n\nIt was the right call to make because the line that followed, due to his insistence on changing the system, snaked about halfway through the restaurant, full of customers waiting their turn to pay their bill.\n\nOnce lunch hour had died down, I smiled to myself and went back to keying in people’s tickets the way I always had. My part time coworker sheepishly approached me with new additions to existing orders since then.",

I attend the latter due to my not wanting to take out a copious amount in student loans, and the professors that teach there are a gamble in terms of quality. This is where our antagonist (who we'll refer to as Mr. V.) comes into play: I had taken a Composition II class the semester prior and was on great terms with the man, even having sent a \"get well soon\" card to his office when he missed a week due to him being severely ill. This is all to say that he and I were pretty close and, with my grades being 95% or more on every assignment, we never had any spats academically either. Come the following semester, where I needed to take what the college referred to as a \"worldly elective\" in order to finish my Associate's degree. I decided to take Shakespearean, literature with this same man as my professor, and for the first few months everything went swimmingly; assignments got submitted on time, papers were graded with the same high marks I had been receiving, etc, etc. This is where the issues came into play: this semester, since he and I were close and the class was Shakespearean literature, my papers were comedic in nature and I didn't see a need to put my usual 110% into them. He never had a problem with this, going as far as to say he looked forward to reading them as my jokes would make him laugh. Then we got the play \"The Tempest\" which, in his words, \"was Shakespeare's magnum opus\" and everything went downhill. I wrote my paper as usual, submitted it, and within 48 hours got an email telling me how disgusted he was at my behavior and that the paper was \"a pathetic excuse research-wise and a joke format-wise.\" He said he'd give me one more attempt, but not to expect much leniency in the future, to which I responded, \"you'll have it back within 72 hours.\" I was livid; infuriated beyond belief that 7 papers in he got mad at how I wrote and formatted it for the sole reason that it was about his favorite play. He wants a paper that will wow him? I'll wow him alright. I traded shifts with some of my coworkers and for the next 72 hours, I wrote an 8-page paper about why the Tempest is Shakespeare's worst works, citing some crucial names in the literary world and providing close to 20 sources claiming this to be true. I had other professors at the college proofread it, as well as family and friends of mine who excel in all things literature, just to be doubly sure of its quality, and submitted it exactly 72 hours later. The paper was given a perfect 100% and I never heard from him outside of class again. According to a friend of mine who took that class the next year, he no longer claims that Tempest is the best work by Shakespeare, and as a whole seemed defeated about even teaching the class.  \n\n\n  \nTl;Dr - Shakespeare professor got pissy that I made a joke in my essay that his favorite play wasn't the best, so I proved factually it's actually the worst.",

        "text": "I’m sorry for the long post, also English is not my first language, forgive my mistakes.\nThere’s this pizza restaurant in the neighborhood that’s owned by a Greek family of 3 elderly siblings (68m the prep cook, 66f, 60f) very affordable place, has been there for half a century. I (30m) am from out of state and worked there for 8years. \n\nAfter 3 years working there, the place closed for renovations for a couple months during that time I started playing lacrosse and worked at a couple other restaurants; lacrosse it’s a very important part of my life the people i met there saved me from my mental health issues, and my best friends, people i consider family and have been there more in my life than my current family(story for another time), so i dedicate a lot of my time to my friends and my team, I’m even in the board for the team and I am the happiest person alive because of my friends.\n\nWhen the restaurant opened doors again, my boss (60f let’s call her Anna) called me to come back and work for them. \n\nAnna matched my pay per hour from the other places and I came back, little did I know her previous right hand would only work part time and eventually leave, and her son (31m) is not reliable, so someone had to step up (first mistake)\n\nI was working 50-60 hours a week, I was the only one who had the certifications for whenever we had health inspectors coming in, as well as me being the one doing the schedule, alcohol inventory, managed all the computer aspect of the restaurant, like POS(point of sale), clocking in/out times, reports, and price of the food also created the new menu, new items, and was the one behind fixing everything that broke. Basically if anything happened I was the go-to person. I was their restaurant manager without the salary and the name, so technically I was just “another cook”\n\nPeople would come to me with all their problems. problems with the computer, to food quality, anti Karens safety, and staff problems, but whenever it was time to tell someone to do something they would be “you’re just another cook not my boss” and they were right. Also Anna hated that I dedicated time to lacrosse, she would be like “you would save money if you stopped playing lacrosse and worked more hours” and I would tell her to mind her business because it’s the only thing keeping me alive right now.\n\nAnna would boast to people how I was her right hand, and how I was like another son to her, which would piss me off because of I was like part of the family I would be making as much money as their family or to at least afford living somewhat comfortably. Now that I look back she was a horrible boss, and only saw me as a doormat, I spent 4 years after the renovations where I couldn’t afford a vacation, nor I was allowed to take one, I would request time off I would be told no, things got so bad that my doctor and my therapist talked together and wrote her a letter claiming that the overwork and stress from work are having serious effect on me physically and mentally and that I had to work less hours and take some time off to relax, which is how I could finally take my first vacation in years and traveled to NYC for the first time. \n\nFor a couple decades they didn’t pay overtime until the year before I left because I’m guessing Anna’s previous right hand have called the department of labor because he used to work over 60 hours a week before the renovations. After that she started paying the legal time and a half after working 40 hours per week. \n\nLast year, my previous car died, so I had to buy me a new car and the check was barely paying my bills, i tried working more hours, but the stress was so much I could barely handle it, I was only eating my free meal I had from the restaurant, which would be breakfast and lunch, only because Anna’s sister allowed me because she took pity on me, so as long as I cooked breakfast for their brother every morning I had breakfast too. I talked to Anna and all she gave me $1 raise above everybody else and pull me out of the payroll for a month and pay me in cash, that still was not enough, i had it, I couldn’t handle the disrespect from my coworkers, the stress of being the go-to person, and the audacity of just getting $1 more above my coworkers when my responsibilities were bigger and i was the one to blame if something went wrong. After 8 years and all the responsibilities I carried, I was getting paid $15 per hour. \n\nThen luckily my work permit and green card arrived last March, and I got me a  second job as a restaurant supervisor, less stressful same pay, less responsibilities, but the company that owns the restaurant were shady so eventually I left; After a month in that job I looked for another, my current job, I’m more valued at this place, I am respected, I started at the bottom but now I’m one of the chefs/manager and I’m even looking to buy a house next year.\nWhen I gave my 2 weeks to Anna she was furious, I told her I don’t mind coming and helping out whenever she needed, but she told me how ungrateful, how she treated me like family, and how could I do this to them? And thanks but that they don’t need me; her siblings hugged me wished me the best, and cried as I told them that I will come and see them that I still loved everybody.\n\nAfter I’ve left I got in contact with my ex-co-manager and she told me that things are not the same, food quality, speed has fallen, they haven’t gotten beer in over 3 months (last time I placed the order) and that the computer system is crashing, they went back to clocking in with an old school machine that punched holes in a card, and that Anna’s sister stopped caring about the place, doesn’t talk anymore, and barely cooks. Anna’s son had to step up and he takes too long to do things, he still texts me and asks me to help him out placing orders, fix things with the computer and things like that. I stop by every now and then and Anna is cold as usual, her sister tells me “when you decide to come back we have your spot for you” which I always answer with a hug, and the brother always hugs me when I come. \n\nWhen I did my taxes this year I found that Anna tried to fuck me over with the taxes from last year, which I knew she was gonna do because I know how petty she is and she likes taking revenge, but I was ready for it, went to my accountant with paystubs, bank statements and instead of paying $2000 I paid only $300 that I owed for the month I was out of the payroll, my accountant was like “wow, she really tried to screw you over”. \nNow I feel sour, my mom is telling me to let it go and just forget about it, but I wanna take revenge\nAny advice?",

I got 4 of them, and I asked if I can just buy a care plan for one bar stool and he said yes. \nOkay, for $14.99 I bought the care plan that will cover for 5 years and I’ll claim the warranty if ANY chair breaks.

So I looked up the cemetery where my favorite grandmother is buried and wrote that address down.  I also included a note that said “love you!  Hope you’re doing well over there!”  Vague but true.  Turned it in, got a 100. \n\nI don’t think they ever found out.  My only regret is that now that poor cemetery gets a newsletter from my school every month.",

To the point we have safety briefings on the regular to keep us updated. Yesterday, we had a talk on compactor safety. One of our big rules is to Never EVER under any circumstances climb into a compactor unless it’s unhooked from any power sources. Sounds like common sense right? Well, dear reader, as you’re about to learn, apparently common sense isn’t that common.\n\nAfter getting our briefing, we get our assignments and are sent on our merry way. I go to my area, clean it and pull trash. As I’m walking to the compactor, what do I see sticking out of it but two trousered legs. After the shock lasting a nanosecond wore off, I start yelling. “What are you doing, you idiot?! Don’t go crawling around in there!” I know I shouldn’t have yelled but I was so mad. \n\nWell Mr. Idiot fell out and starts yelling at me. “Don’t you go yelling at me! Where is your manager!? Get them here right now!”\n\nMalicious Compliance mode activated.\n\nI put on my sweetest smile and say “Of course, I’m so sorry. Let’s get my manager here.”\n\nMr. Idiot smirks and is like “Good girl.”\n\nSo I call my manager over and ask her to come over. Meanwhile Mr. Idiot is smiling like the cat who got the cream. I’m fighting to keep from smiling. Because my manager, Miss Heroine, takes safety as seriously as I do. I’ve seen her reduce full grown men to tears over safety issues.\n\nMiss Heroine shows up and Mr. Idiot says “You should train your workers to not yell.”\n\nMiss Heroine turns to me. “And why were you yelling at him?”\n\n“Because I caught him climbing into the compactor and I got scared he’d be crushed.”\n\nIn a nanosecond, Mr. Idiot goes from looking like contented cat to looking like a scolded dog.\n\nAfter a sound verbal thrashing, Miss Heroine calls Mr. Idiot’s manager. Within 30 minutes, Mr. Idiot was clearing out his desk, still smelling of garbage.",

First job out of the armed services, and about six months in, just when I've gotten my feet wet.  The system in question was mid-range computer, with four enormous 500 MB disk drives.  Seventy pounds of storage, already discontinued and available in refurbished only.  Customer has contracted for hardware support directly and their system is down with a crashed drive.\n\nI drive for two hours to customer site, and get a message, call Loud Sales Witch (LSW).  LSW conferences in my manager (DJ) and starts complaining that customer was down and no one was keeping her informed.  Well Customer Service, the people in the cubes in front of your office, are supposed to pass on updates, but we'll listen.  After listening to why this customer is going to drop our contract for poor service and it's our fault for not keeping her informed, she announces that she has to leave early today, but to call her at home when the system is restored to service.  It's just after 1:00 pm.\n\nWe all hang, and I wait for another hour before field service finally shows up.  In the 80's, changing a disk drive meant setting dip switches, formatting to a controller, 6 hours, then initializing the new disk 2 hours, restoring from tape, 2 hours, restoring transaction files, another hour, and finally, a cold reboot, to make sure everything was back in service.  A down customer was automatically approved overtime.  While all this was going on, I had a nice expense account dinner, then picked up some movies at the local video store to play in customer's training room.  \n\nFinally, the system reboot completed, at 2:40 AM.  Before I started the drive home, I had a final task I'd been looking forward too.  The first time I dialed, the answering machine picked up.  Since this was very important call, I hung up and redialed.  \n\n\"Is LSW there?  This RR from work.\"\n\n\"What' wrong? !!\"\n\n\"Nothing's wrong, you asked me to call you at home when customer was back in service.  The system was just rebooted.\"\n\n\"\\[deep breath, pause\\], Did you call DJ?  What did he have to say?\"\n\n\"I just left him a voicemail at work, he doesn't need a call if things are going to be running when customer gets in.\"\n\n\"\\[longer pause\\]\n\n\"Have a good night.\"\n\nAbout a month later, West Coast Sales Manager comes to town, and I invited myself to lunch with him.  We're tearing into lunch and \"So you talk to LSW lately?\"  Loud laughter.  Turns out he talked her down, you asked to be called, you went to bed without checking in, last year RR was in the service, on a watch station you follow orders, did you stop to think about what would happen or ask how long repairs would take.  You got exactly what you asked for.  SM had been a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam and was still laying down covering fire.",

It was easy overtime for the most part because normally it was some routine easy stuff for 16 hours of overtime pay.\n\nAfter they announced their new policy, the team got together and agreed that if any of us got called in on a weekend, we would refuse to come in.\n\nThe first Saturday after the new policy was installed, we had all planned on getting together to have some beers and BBQ. Side note - This was prior to personal cell phones\n\nThe phone rings at our host's house and it's our supervisor. She asks if the host can come in to do an inspection on one of the large flying machines due to be delivered the following week. (When we make a delivery, the company gets paid for the flying machine) He tells her no, he is far too intoxicated to perform that kind of work, let alone drive in. She asks if she knows where one of our colleagues might be, and he tells her he's right here. Colleague tells her the same thing, and the process repeats until she has gotten to everyone who worked in our lab. Then we all got called at home on that Sunday as well with the same results. Not a lot they can do since we're not on the clock.\n\nNow these flying machines will have a crew of several mechanics and QA people assigned to this particular machine. They literally have nothing to do without the results of our testing. The mechanics and QA were paid more than us, and they were drawing overtime just sitting there.

        "text": "This one dates back a while to ~2017 but have been wanting to share it ever since, so apologies if it's a bit long.\n\n**Background**: \n\nI was in my 3rd year of an accounting job I absolutely hated, but I also hated the industry as a whole and was essentially using the position to bide my time as I learned a new skill to eventually jump to an entirely new career. \n\nMy boss at the time, who I'll call Tia, was the shining example of the specific flavor of toxicity that I'd found sinking its teeth into most of the accounting departments I've worked in (imagine the power trip of middle management + the prestige of managing multi-million dollar transactions). She was the first accountant for the company when it started and had become the de-facto choice for 'new highest position in the department' every time the company's growth called for a departmental restructuring. The only thing I could determine was earning her these positions was her confidence and conviction in the way she'd determined things needed to be done, which C-suite just ate right up, even paying for her to get whatever training/certification she needed to qualify for the new roles presented to her.\n\nIn the meantime, she'd given me 3 consecutive annual reviews scoring a solid 0% satisfaction rate each time, which was always enough to justify a 0% raise but never enough to justify actually letting me go and putting me out of my misery, so at this point I was fully checked out, especially after finding out I'd become the lowest paid employee out of ~100 (including interns and the front desk clerk).\n\nIn the latest restructuring, Tia was not promoted to the new CFO role as the board wanted real experience, but was given a Controller role while a new level of management was added between us. HR had also become its own department, no longer falling under accounting's perview. Tia didn't seem to like simultaneously becoming 2nd in accounting's command while also losing control of HR. She convinced the company to send her to law school so she could eventually transition into some kind of frankenstein-esque accounting/legal/HR position that would oversee essentially everything the company did outside of actual production. This required her to leave the office around 2-3pm every afternoon to attend classes, making her unreachable until the evenings. \n\nThe new management position that opened between us saw 3-4 employees join and leave for greener pastures over the course of a year and a half, but the story takes place while I was under the only manager I actually liked, who I'll call Kevin. I could see him doing what he could to advocate for me while still being forced by Tia to treat me the way she had previously treated me, and I could tell it made him feel awkward handing these decisions down my way. I respected his attempts to work with us and he actually helped us create a functional/efficient department for a few glorious but short-lived months.\n\n**Story:**\n\nSuddenly, a bill was passed in the U.S. stating that salaried employees making less than 40k/yr would be eligible for overtime pay, taking effect later in the year. After 3 years of no raises, I was sitting at around $37,500/yr, making me eligible for the for the eventual overtime.\n\nWorking in accounting, it's pretty much expected that you'll be working 50-60 hours a week, especially when closing out the monthly/quarterly/annual financials. However, after being shafted for so long and still being stuck with shit work that had little effect on the actual financials, I was actively giving them as close to 40 hours a week as possible, only staying behind if we'd gotten an important request towards the end of the day that Kevin begged me to take care of before leaving.\n\nI knew it would look a bit off if I suddenly started working a bunch of overtime after this change took place, so I planned on very slowly ramping up my hours over the preceding months to eventually take advantage of the extra pay. After 1-2 months I was regularly putting in 45-55 (with most extra hours spent re hours a week and looking forward to the income this new workflow would provide me.\n\nI guess they eventually caught on, as Kevin pulled me into a conference room and presented me with a contract to sign stating that I wasn't to work any overtime without Tia's approval. For reasons you'll see below, I quickly recognized this as a way to never have to work an extra hour for the rest of my tenure at the company. I signed it and immediately cut out all overtime, leaving at 4pm that day as I'd worked through lunch. The next day I stopped showing up early, started taking actual lunches, and could be heard peeling out of the lot at 5:01 every day. \n\nKevin noticed my sudden lack of hours and tried to mention the contract not being in effect until the bill kicked in. I reminded him that we had a signed contract that failed to list a start or end date so I considered it fully in effect. I could see the \"oh shit\" realization hit but he begrudgingly accepted the loss. (I'll mention again that he was great and this action had obviously come from Tia and he was now stuck dealing with the repercussions the same as I was, so he really didn't fight me too hard on it).\n\nLater that week, an important client request came in around 4:45. He asked If I could stay behind to work on it and I asked if he had Tia's approval. This was his second 'Oh shit\" moment, as unfortunately, due to her classes, Tia had become unreachable between 2-8 pm every weekday for the foreseeable future and he didn't usually know he'd need extra work from me until after 4.\n\nEverything went exactly to plan as I got to enjoy a comfortable 40 hour week, throwing the contract back at them any time they tried to squeeze even an extra minute out of my time.\n\nNow for the real kicker. Before the new bill took effect, a judge blocked it and shut it down entirely, meaning no more overtime pay for salaried employees. A crippling loss for the workforce but I at least still got to enjoy my new schedule. Management tried to claw back my hours but, hey, I still have a contract that says I can't, sorry guys.\n\nI was finally pulled into Tia's office, who tried to explain the lack of necessity for the overtime approval now that the overtime bill wouldn't be coming into play. I again reminded her we had a signed contract with no dates and no mention of this being in relation to impending overtime law. \n\nThen came my favorite part of the conversation:\n\n&gt; So, yes, this is still a valid contract, but I want to be clear that it doesn't override your original employment contract here with us.\n\n&gt; You mean the employment contract that states 40 hours a week?\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nI was eventually let go a few months later after replying \"Because I don't\" when the CFO mentioned people saying I look like I don't care about my job, but I'd finally built up my skills enough to find a position in my new industry while still enjoying my severance, so I consider it a win. 4 years later, I'm doing work I enjoy from home, hanging out with my dogs with a calmer mind and a fatter wallet, all while they're still stressing over someone else's money.",

You could also get into the fenced storage area outside and behind the store from the side of our yard, which the public could not see and didn't know about. This will be relevant later. \n\nOne day my mother, observing us from the front porch, let my sister and I return a 6 pack of soda bottles at said store, and use the money to buy candy. \n\nI didn't understand the exact process, as my sister handled the deal, but the store owner was very nice, and I thought I was somehow getting free candy, and that this arrangement was now permanent. \n\nThe next day, I had run out of candy from my stash, and without waiting for my sister, since I was a big boy now,  I went from playing in the front yard, back into the store to get another free supply of candy. \n\nSo I smiled and said hi to the owner, grabbed my free candy and headed out the door. The owner thought otherwise. He made what seemed like a big fuss, gratuitously gestulating, and loudly scolded me on how candy isnt free, and I only get some candy if I trade him some empty bottles. \n\nHe then pointed to an open door, that lead outside to the storage area in back of the store, to where there was a stack of maybe twenty empty soda bottle six packs, to make sure I understood. You may know where this is going. \n\nSo the next day, from my secret side yard entrance, I went and grabbed a 6-pack of empty bottles from his stack. Then returned back to my yard and then into the front of the store. Where I returned the bottles for candy. Just as the owner had instructed. \n\nI did this again and again. I pulled this magical candy trick off maybe 3 times that day, and maybe 3 times the next, and was growing an epic stash of candy back home.

Bottles for candy. That was our deal. \n\nWhen confronted, my mother of course apologized and paid back the missing money.

She is very very religious (Christian) has told me for 2 years my beliefs are wrong, fighting with me no matter how many times I ask her to keep it out of the work place, she has yelled at me previously multiple times, going as far as saying and I quote “I just know your not going to the good place after death”, insinuating I’m going to burn in hell, mind you, all I have done at this point is have different beliefs than her. Now she has asked me to stay off PR for “job security”, greatly cutting my hours and taking away half my work load, so I did just that, I will not touch it no matter how much she is complaining. She now is struggling to get it all done in a timely matter, having to work until 8 pm and even messed up 2 checks last week, its obvious she is struggling w/o my help.\n     Fast forward to roughly 3 weeks ago, she is charging everyone extra insurance for the work they missed in 2022 (our work pays half ins., if you miss a whole week, at the end of the year you pay $$$ back for whatever work covered). She asked me to check and see if people missed work that she didn’t charge, I compiled to what she asked of me. \n     So, I noticed she is doing it to everyone, BUT HERSELF, so I took it into my own hands to see how much work she missed and if she owes money, big surprise, she owes quite a large sum due to her 3 different 1-2 week vacations in 1 year. I know she wont charge herself for it, So, I ratted to the boss, our CPA is currently adding it up for her, 20+ years of work and likely no payback. she also has already been caught stealing about 10 year ago, she put tens of thousands on company card that was in my aunts name (my aunt quit and gave her the company card to dispose of, instead she used it for 5 years on personal use. \n   She always told me to watch out for stealing employees…",

        "text": "TLDR: i asked for a raise so my company tried to get any possible dirt they could find on me to not promote me for a job I’ve been doing for a year full time already.\n\n\nFor context I work in a Level one trauma center hospital for a company that very much has a monopoly on our area. I have worked in the transport department since 2017. About a year ago, I took a job sitting at the desk managing the other transporters working (Dispatch). So essentially I am in a shift lead role. Dispatchers are supposed to get an increase in pay considering it’s a job with a larger skill set and responsibility. I wasn’t pressing on that because in all honesty the job is much easier than transporting (as far as physical ability as we walk an average of 11 miles a day) however, about 2-3 months ago, i asked for dispatcher compensation and they’ve been dragging their feet. They actually promoted another person with lower seniority to dispatcher on the night shift. \n\nOver the last couple of weeks, i have been pressing the issue. On my last couple of shifts i have noticed every one of my employees being pulled into HR one by one. It started with one of my employees stating on Valentine’s Day, that i had called her boyfriend a homosexual (??) and then they extended their investigation to my performance. \n\nI did not call her those things. I am in the lgbtq community myself. Using that term offensively doesn’t make sense as i would be insulting myself. I would never use that term as a way to talk down to someone. Anyways, they finally pulled me into HR, asked me about that and ultimately threw that out. They knew that was bullshit (the girl wanted to leave early to see her man on vday she pulls shit like this all the time). \n\nSo basically what happened was they did a week and a half long investigation and couldn’t find anything, so they wrote me up for looking at houses on the work computer (which i haven’t done since i moved into my apartment 9 months ago) and demoted me back to transport. I have a physical disability that they know means i can’t walk those 11 miles. So essentially they are pushing me out. What really happened is i asked to be compensated for a job i excel at and have for a year, and they found some low level offense to write me up for so that i wouldn’t be eligible for the job i was already doing. \n\nThe reason i post here is because i need to figure out what i need to do to spite them without losing my job. The boss that is taking over for me has no clue what he’s doing and a lot of people that i manage are considering quitting because literally the only thing good about working there was the fact that i made working in that environment less miserable everyday. The pay is literally 12$ an hour to deal with death sickness and sadness. I’m the only one that brings a light into the office and they don’t like that. Help!",

My relationship with dad has always been trough many ups and downs but right now is at its lowest. I am, in fact, suffering from a dca and he doesn’t do anything but blaming me for it. I’m already dealing with a lot right now and I absolutely do not need someone to say that it’s all in my head and I should be less vain and superficial. I tried to explain to him that it’s a much more complicated problem but he doesn’t seem to listen nor care. For example, two weeks ago I had a strong panic attack (which paralyzed me completely in the middle of the class) and the only thing he said about it was that he didn’t understand how I got so weak and stupid.\nOn top of that he rarely helps my mum financially even though me and my brother only live with her. She struggles a lot to support both of us but he refuses to pay child support in any case. \n\nNot wanting to fight and end up crying like I always do when he’s around lately, I asked my boyfriend if he was willing to come hiking with us to comfort me. After telling me that he would see if he could for a couple days, he ultimately said that he wants to party and get drunk on Saturday evening without having to wake up at half past seven the next day. \n\nI understand him and and one part of me feels guilty for demanding since he has just finished the exams. On the other hand I also believe that, considering he’s aware of awful situation with my dad, my request wasn’t so egoistic. I can’t help but having the impression he doesn’t really care about me if he prefers let me go trough an hell of a day alone instead of sleeping all morning. AITA?",

Cue his malicious compliance. He returned back to school an hour later with a grin on his face and praise from the teacher for getting his tie. What they didn't realise is that he left his bike at school. He took a leisurely stroll home taking in the sights. He ate a bowl of cereal when he got home. Put his tie on. Then, he went in the opposite to a McDonalds to get a double sausage and egg mcmuffin as he was still peckish and eventually took a leisurely stroll back 😂. A ten minute return trip took him an hour. The school was happy that he returned wearing his tie, oblivious to how close he lived. They even said in his yearly school report that he is always well dressed. He now occasionally forgets his tie on purpose so he can be sent home to skip a boring class, to get some food or have a little cheeky nap. He just needs to be back within an hour and knows he will be praised for being compliant with school rules. He owned up to this recently but how can I be even slightly angry at him for playing the system 😂👍. Absolute legend.",

In my country we are still under quite strict anti-terrorism security measures. This means that in my building, you have to either have a corporate badge to go in or someone from the company you are visiting needs to come get you at reception (I can't even call some of them as they are self contained corporate offices, the visitor has to call whoever they're visiting themselves). I also work for the building and not for any of the corporations renting office space in the upper floors.\n\nYesterday a very neat and karen-type woman came in and asked to go up to one of the corporate floors. As she didn't work here, I told her that someone had to come get her. She started huffing and puffing and calling various people while complaining that \"she never had to do this before\" \"it's ridiculous, I've already been here\". No one would answer her calls and she got more and more worked up, berating me for my \"ridiculous behaviour\", telling me \"you have no idea who I am\" and screaming that I needed to let her in NOW and that she had A VERY IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT!  \n\n\nThis escalated to the point where she basically tried to force her way in while I was threatening to call security. All this time I was basically reapeating \"It's procedure m'am/I don't know who you are and I don't care/get away from the security doors m'am\".   \n\n\nSomeone from the office FINALLY came to get her and as she was led away upstairs she called me a string of insults and insisted that she would \"escalate this to management\" and that I needed to \"be taught a lesson\". To which I answered \"Oh don't worry about it mam, *I'm gonna escalate it myself\".*  \n\n\nWhich I absolutely did, told everything to my boss in an email, noting that the person asked me to escalate this to my management. Now my boss isn't perfect in a lot of situations but he absolutely will not concede anything on security, and he assessed that I had absolutely done my job to the best I could have and was blameless in this situation. After watching the video, where she is clearly seen berating and insulting me while I keep calm they've decided to escalate the situation to the corporate management in question, telling them that she was barred from site and they needed to apologise to me for her behaviour.   \n\n\nI just got the email and not only did they apologise for her behaviour, they ended it by this absolutely delicious titbit : \"the person in question was being considered for a position but this was retracted at this time for obvious reasons\". \n\n  \nMe : 1, Karen : 0",

The very next day I was in my bosses office being told that I was not working enough hours.  Another time I had an appointment after work and needed to go, but they wanted me there, I told them no, and that caused them to ask if I wanted to be put on hourly.  I jumped at that since I was putting in easily 60 -70 hours a week.  Here is the malicious compliance part, I was authorized to sign for $30000, for equipment, and when I made an order it was my practice to have the manager over the department to co-sign any request, they had more signing authority than I did.

It roughly translates to \"womens loyalty\" or \"loyal women\".\n\nSo in 1140  the castle was sieged and they where running out of food and had no hope anymore that an army would come to their rescue.  So they sent one of their men outside to parlkay and come up with the terms for their surrender.  But the army did not really want to give them anything, cause they knew the castle would fall soon either way.\n\nAlso the castle currentlay belonged to the Welfen, one of germanies oldest higjh aristocracy families ( they where even powerfull enough to put one of their own on  the emperors throne, you see ibn the holy rom,an empiure of german nation s, the empreror got ellected  by the high aristocracy and powerfull mnembers of the church)  while the hohenstaufern was the one besieging it (also a very powerfull family that managed to get on the throne on several occasionbs).   Those 2 houses had beef going back centuries.  So the people in the castle knew when they give up without an agreement this is getting ugly, well , even uglier.   The high ranking people inside would be taken hostage and only get free if they agree to a ludicrously high rtansom, and the rest would most likely be executed. If they are lucky some would \"only\"  have their swordhand hacked off and one or both eyes be burned out with glöowing iron .\n\nAfter some back and forth  negotiations they finally agreed on the following conditions : that the women and children would be allowed to leave unmolested and unharmed, and as soon as the people inside would see they are safeloy off the mountain, they would open the gates and face whatever comes then.  Also since it was winter (december 21st 1140)  they where allowed to take as much as they can carry with them.  So what did the women do  ? They carried their men to safety, and left all the goods behind.  The Staufern where  so perplexed by the trick they just let it happüen. After all the gave their word that the women could leave unharmed and unmolested, and could take as much as they could carry.  There went all the ransom money.",

Then he told me he needed to put the call through to the right person and asked if I was OK with being put on hold. I said yes so I was put on hold for the second time in the call. Only this time they left me there on hold!   \n\n\nAfter a while I got back on their website and asked to text chat with them, the whole time still on hold on the phone. I told them I was on hold and was not going to hang it up. They just focussed on the issue I wanted to complain about and ignored that I was still on the phone.  \n\n\nI got highly annoyed that they were not going to resolve my issue with the delivery, making me wait another 24 hours while they 'investigate'. So I told them again I am still on the phone and I am not hanging it up.  \n\n\nNow I should explain, here in the UK the caller pays for the call and mobile phones are billed at a higher rate than land lines. They called my mobile. I also have no social life due to a social anxiety disorder so I very rarely get phone calls from anyone, including family. So me staying connected to the call is not going to cause me any issues! LOL  \n\n\nAs I said at the start, this is going on right now. So far the call is at 2 hours and 22 minutes as I type this. I have tweeted at the corporate and help services on Twitter what is going on but they have not responded.  \n\n\nNow, there is the strong possibility that they pay their phone company a fixed rate and so do not really care that I am doing this but that would mean their phone company is going to have to pay for this call and they wont like that! Though I really hope they have to pay for each call like the rest of us and this one is going to cost them dearly! LOL  \n\n\n2 hours, 30 mins now and counting...",

        "text": ".So I have a friend Ted who 6-7 years ago was 64 and considering retirement. Ted worked in Health analytics for a large metro health organisation. He would look at patient data and see ways to improve patient outcomes and gain funding. Each month he would email to the relevant department heads data and links for government grants or funding applications. Twelve months prior to this Ted got a new boss Sally who didn't appreciate what Ted did. Sally pretty much ignored Ted except for a simply instruction that all data and reports go to her and no one else. She would deal with it.\n\nThe organisation declares a restructure with lots of Jobs losses . they are extremely determined to get this through. Ted is to be redundant. In a meeting Sally tells Ted his work is useless and he is of no use to the organisation. She says she hasn't opened one of his email reports in 12 months and that clearly shows he doesn't matter to the organisation. In three months he will be redundant and receive a handsome package(over a years pay) .Sally was pretty rude to Ted and Hr ask her to leave. it is decided that Sally will longer deal with Ted. \n\nThe union was putting a a decent fight and slowing down the restructure. Ted makes the offer to Hr that he will not fight the redundancy if they pay him three months sick leave and after that his redundancy. They agree but insist that he does a full data clean for patient confidentiality reasons in the next two days and than his sick leave starts. Cue malicious compliance. Ted backs up a copy than rings IT who delete every file (all on his hard drive and not on a server-he was not so Tech savvy ) and physically destroy his hard drive. He also asks them  also to search through any unopened emails he had sent and delete them off the server. IT wipe every last trace of Ted from the system. \n\nTed gave the copy of his data  to the internal auditors on his last day.\n\nOn Ted's last day he also  discovered that Sally didn't know he was going on sick leave the next day. She rings with a sweet as pie voice saying\" Hey Ted I need to look at those numbers you sent me as i can't find them. The auditors say we are 2.2 million short of funding this year and you might be able to help out\" Ted replies sure but ring me tomorrow. Ted leaves  and retires happily every after.\n\nSally apparently could not find Ted's data in the coming weeks. Ted ignored her calls as he was on sick leave. The internal auditors  investigated and found that Sally had cost the organisation over 2.5 million in funding . At the same time complaints came from department heads about Ted's redundancy.\n\nSomeone forwarded Ted an email a couple months later from the CEO stating \"after a brief conversation with Sally she has decide to look for other opportunities.",

        "text": "I WFH most of the time. Recently, I had to file an expense report for mileage since I drove my vehicle to a specific location for work. \n\nI had previously calculated my mileage using the location I actually left from to get to the location I’m going to. This was usually my home to whatever venue I’m going to for work. I assumed this was the way that made the most sense. \n\nThis particular event was less than 20 miles from where I live, so I submitted the mileage from my home address as that’s where I left from. \n\nMy expense report was then sent back to me stating it needed to be amended. The message read something like “…per company policy mileage must be calculated as if you were going from the office and not your home address. Please adjust accordingly and resubmit.” \n\nI think to myself, “well that’s dumb,” move on and resubmit as though I’m leaving from my work address.\n\nTurns out the office is a little more than double the distance to the location I went to compared to the actual distance I traveled leaving from my house.\n\nSo, the “company policy” made what would’ve been a $30 reimbursement a $60 reimbursement. Sucks for them. Guess that’s what you get for having a blanket policy that needs to be followed no matter what. \n\nTLDR;\n\nCompany has a policy that requires all mileage reports to be calculated as though you’re going to/from the office instead of the actual location your going to/from. It worked out in my favor this time.",

        "text": " \n\nDisclaimer: Names have been changed to protect the people involved.\n\nMe a 19-year-old (at the time)\n\nLaura, General manager and both the sweetest woman and the best boss I've ever worked for.\n\nTed, manager. The arrogance of White Goodman, and the bi\\*\\*\\*y attitude of Louis Litt.\n\nOnce upon a time, I used to work for a small chain of diners known for their golden arches. I got hired shortly after graduating H.S. and had worked there for almost a year when Laura announced to our crew that Ted had been promoted to assistant G.M. This made several people upset because Ted would go on to use his new authority to exchange \"favors\" for raises.\n\nA few weeks after Ted's promotion, I woke up on a Saturday feeling 50 shades of terrible, but I got up and did my morning ritual before work. When I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth I saw that my face and neck were physically green. Like, Vlassic pickle green. But being 19, and terrified of disappointing management, I finished, got dressed, and went to work. I punch in and head to the back to wash my hands and Laura is the first to say hi.\n\nMorning OP- Baby what is wrong with you?\n\nI dunno, ma'am, all I know is I feel terrible.\n\nBaby, why ain't you call me?\n\nI didn't wanna let you down.\n\nHoney, you are sick. Something really a matter with you. Laura pulled out her phone and called the nearest Urgent Care.\n\nHello, I need to schedule your nearest appointment for one of my people. His name is OP, What's your birthday baby? Now your address. Thank you, ma'am. He'll be right over.\n\nMiss Laura, I can't afford a doctor visit right now.\n\nDon't you worry about that honey, I'm gone take care of it for you.\n\nAfter a thorough exam and some bloodwork, the doctor prescribes me a trio of antibiotics, and four days bed rest. Can't remember what I had. Sorry. So I called my store to speak to Laura after leaving Urgent Care.\n\nSo, the doctor gave me medicine and I'm supposed to take four days off.\n\nOkay, baby. I'm gone double that for you and don't you worry, I'll make sure you get paid for all of it.\n\nA few hours later I'm laying in bed watching tv and my phone rings.\n\nHello?\n\nYeah, OP? Where the hell are you?\n\nIs there a problem?\n\nYou can say that. We're an hour into dinner and your ass is nowhere to be seen!\n\nDid you talk to Laura?\n\nWhat the f\\*\\*\\* does she have to do with you not being here?\n\nDid you talk to Laura?\n\nI don't need to talk to Laura. Listen, If you're not on the clock within the hour, I suggest you start looking for other employment.\n\nSo I did. Got dressed again, went to work just like Ted told me, and clocked in. And wouldn't you know it, Laura was the first person to see me.\n\nBaby, what are you doing here? I thought you was home resting.\n\nI was, but Ted called me a bit ago and told me either I come in or I'm fired.\n\nDid you tell him to talk to me?\n\nYes, and he said he didn't need to.\n\nIs that so? Ted! Come back here, please!\n\nI'm in the middle of getting my s\\*\\*\\* mixed! What--- the f\\*\\*\\* is wrong with your face?\n\nYou should have talked to Laura.\n\nTed, OP is going home and he's gone be home for another 7 days. I don't wanna hear a word from you bout this, understand?\n\nRight.\n\nThe day before I was supposed to go back to work, I got a call telling me I needed to report to franchise HQ, for a meeting with Owner, HR, and Ted.\n\nWhen I got there, I spoke to franchise owner who informed me that Laura was so enraged by Ted's statement that he didn't need to talk to her about my condition that she called HQ and told him everything. I was then subjected to the weakest apology ever delivered by a member of the human race. After what I gathered was a very serious conversation, Ted had agreed to transfer to the franchise's least profitable store, but not until he'd apologized to me for threatening my job.\n\nA few months after Ted's transfer we were informed that his store folded due to a lack of positive leadership. Apparently, his new employees were less than thrilled to have a womanizer for a boss.  Last I heard of Ted, he was a detailer for a local cab company. Laura, however, was promoted to regional manager for the way she'd looked after her employees, they figured she could teach that to the other GMs. We're still good friends to this day.",

        "text": "At my last job, my boss (let’s call her K) hated me. She turned everything into a competition; she mocked me publicly; she took credit for my work; she divulged my personal medical information in front of all our coworkers. She was cruel, and needless to say, I avoided her as much as I could. \n\nSo, now that the stage is set, here’s the context. End of 2020, corona virus blazing, I had just had my first baby. I was a nervous wreck my entire pregnancy, working from home and being extra careful. After maternity leave (which was disgustingly short btw), I had returned to the office with some precautions set in place. My boss became crueler to me over those first few weeks back, and suddenly announced that, regardless of any negative feelings toward it, she had decided we all had to attend this training in another state. Keep in mind that there were mandatory 2 week at-home quarantines in place for anyone coming back to my state, but my boss fully planned on ignoring those quarantines and demanding we all would return to the office as soon as we got back. \n\nI was carrying a heavy workload and pulling a lot of the weight around the office, and I had some rank. So, I felt fully comfortable expressing my deep concerns to K, telling her that it was peak covid season, and that I had a newborn to worry about now. I expressed I simply didn’t feel comfortable going in the middle of a global pandemic and asked if there was a remote training I could attend instead. She firmly, ADAMANTLY insisted there was no remote training, and informed me that I could quit if I was that upset with her decisions. It’s important to note that she insisted this for weeks, even claiming to have contacted the training organization to make sure. I decided on the spot after that meeting that I would be quitting. But I needed to check my boxes first, which took me a few weeks to figure out. \n\nSome time after this meeting and her incessant insistence that there was no remote training, it finally occurred to me to check with the organization putting on the training and ask them to clarify if there truly was a remote training or not. I did, and lo and behold, there WAS - and they had been offering it for months. I asked them to email this information to me. \n\nNow to figure out how to use this valuable information, right? Wrong. As soon as I stepped back into the office, K starts fake-empathizing with me out of nowhere, in front of all our coworkers. saying she really wished she didn’t need to force me to go to this training. So, I said, “if you feel so bad, let me go to the remote training.” She looked at me in surprise, and her face turned beat red. Before she could fight me, I pulled up the email with the information and read it aloud in front of all our coworkers. No one said anything, they just stared, wide-eyed at her while she blubbered like a fool. \n\nLong story short, after pulling that fast one on her, I pulled her into a private meeting a gave my notice. She was horrified because, as I stated prior, I carried a lot of the work around the office. \n\nBut, like she said, I could quit if I didn’t like her decisions 🤷🏻‍♀️",

Well it's a frequent problem that people from the church block my driveway, but it's usually on the weekend when I am sleeping/just waking up so it's not normally a big deal. \n\nExcept today, someone was blocking me in who was at mass for ash Wednesday and there was a minor emergency where I needed to get my kid from school asap. \n\nI went to the church and politely asked if they could have the church member move their car, and the person I talked to flew off the handle. They demanded to know how I knew it was from their church and not a random car (idk maybe the 50 cars up and down my street to go to mass wasn't a dead giveaway). \n\nTo which I replied \"every car on this street is in mass right now.\" And it went on from there, he was PISSED and became instantly confrontational, and I needed to go get my kid. At this point, because of his disregard and disrespect for me, a person who lives next to the church, I started giving him the same attitude back, which he didn't like. \n\nHe took pictures of the car and told me to call a tow truck and have it towed because he \"wasn't going to interrupt mass to have the car moved.\" So I had to call the PD to have the car moved so I could get my child. \n\nWhen PD came to move or impound the car they wanted to check with the church to have who owned the car move. \n\nWhen she went to try and tell whoever it was that owned the car needed to move it mass let out, to which someone who worked at the church came and gave me a half ass apology. She kept gas lighting and interrupting me when I said it was unacceptable and I didn't want to have to call the cops to get the car moved. She was unhelpful and by this point the cop was getting pissed for me. \n\nThe church worker kept interrupting me saying how they won't interrupt mass ever to have someone move their car and it's my job to make sure they don't block my driveway, and kept interrupting me when I said I didn't want to have to involve the cops every time. \n\nWhen the guy who owned the car came out the damage was done and the cop realized how talking to the church was going nowhere she told me every time someone blocks my driveway to call PD to have the car towed and to stop being nice about it. \n\nSo this weekend when someone blocks my driveway again I'll be calling the cops. I'll update come Sunday.",

        "text": "I'm a delivery driver that listens to a lot of reddit content to muster on throughout the long days (shout out to KCC and Storytime), and some fast food stories reminded me of this malicious compliance from my highschool years.\n\nSo I was but a wee naive lad in my junior year of highschool when I got my first job at good ol' Mcdons which happened to be the busiest one in my state.\n\nI was excited to start working and actually earn money to pay for gas and leisure for myself on the weekends. I had recently moved to another city close to where I grew up and where all my friends lived (still very close friends to this day), and I grew up privileged with a $100 monthly allowance for gas to drive to school and such. \n\nIt wasn't enough to actually have fun on weekends considering gas prices due to the distance I had to drive to see my friends.That was when I decided a part-time job would solve my problems until I graduated and went to college\n\nSo, I applied to McGranalds since they offered decent pay and \"flexible scheduling\" (remember that part for later). My schedule when I started was 3 weeknights after school and Saturday or Sunday mornings.\n\nI worked this schedule for about a month and a half before I got sick of missing out on parties the night before I had to work the next day. It was draining me socially. I was working about 20ish hours a week on top of school, so I was getting home late to do hw most nights and couldn't properly enjoy my weekends like I wanted to.\n\nI talked with my general manager and told them I wouldn't be able to work weekends anymore, but I'm more than willing to work an extra weeknight to make up for it, and they agreed.\n\nThis went fine for another 2 months, and I got good at the job and became one of their more reliable workers since I was able to cover any position they needed me to. Then they decided to have a \"talk\" with me. Informing me that I would have to start working weekends because they didn't have enough people in the morning rushes to be able to meet the McDees quota for service.\n\nI told them that I was told I wouldn't have to work weekends since I traded Saturday or Sunday for an extra weeknight shift, but they told me I would work only a few hours on some weeknights and would still be working the same amount of hours per week. I had no choice in the matter.\n\nI was pissed to say the least until I remembered their policy for getting days off. As long as you asked for days off in their calander book 2 weeks in advance, it was a guaranteed day off. You guys can see where this is going.\n\nI maliciously complied and asked for every weekend off for the next 4 months in the calander book. Sure my paycheck took a hit, but I didn't care. Time with the boys was more rewarding than an extra $45 a paycheck.\n\nIt wasn't until 2.5 months later that I got pulled into the office, and my manager asked me why I asked for all the weekends off for those months. I told them that I got the job because I was under the assumption that the scheduling was flexible, but I was told I HAD to work weekends. \n\nThe manager looked absolutely defeated and tried to compromise for every other weekend. This was when I got another malicious thought in my head and said, \"ok, I guess if I HAD TO\".\n\nCue malicious compliance part 2! This time, instead of asking for every weekend off, I asked for every OTHER weekend off. Another month went by before they started scheduling me for weekdays only but with slightly longer weeknight shifts like I wanted.\n\nI only got away with this because turnover rates were high, and I was able to work any position like I said, so I knew there was no way they were gonna fire me. I have many more stories from that place, and I just thought of another while typing this that I might post in r/prorevenge. Thanks for reading, and please be kind to service workers.",

They refused to pay me so I did it anyway, but not happily. It was essentially an unpaid internship) for a very famous political campaign back in 2020. Because it was during the height of Covid everything was virtual. This wasn’t a conventional way to campaign as far as i’m aware but we essentially asked celebrities to endorse our candidate and would have them pop into zoom calls to surprise local state volunteers.  The celebrities would thank the volunteers for their hard work and would have a brief conversation about the campaign. \n\nOne of my jobs was to write up memos and find videos of famous works they were apart of that somehow linked to the campaigns message. This was harder than you might think, as the video had to be a certain length and somehow had to transition into a positive message for the campaign. \n\nI was told to find a clip for Mark Hamil so I, of course, chose a star wars clip. I don’t remember which one it was at this point but it’s pretty irrelevant. \n\nAnyways, my boss allowed me to be on this zoom call because I was in charge of making sure it went smoothly. Right after the clip played and Hamil “surprised” everyone by popping into the zoom call, he started to praise the clip I chose and asked who had picked it. As I went to unmute myself, my boss quickly stepped in and took all of the credit. She said “Hi, I’m *name*. That was me.” I was pissed. \n\nAfter this happened I sat quietly and smiled. I (obviously) didn’t say anything as I was just a pewny unpaid intern, but I did make sure she felt my wrath. \n\nAfter this happened I started to do everything they asked me to do completely half assed. She certainly noticed a change in my work ethic but couldn’t do anything about it considering i was already working for free. For example, I would search for a clip and would simply choose the first one I saw, with no real care whether or not they could stretch the message or not. \n\nThis specifically backfired on her when Kristen Bell did a ‘zoom bomb’ and was struggling to make a connection with a clip I chose from “The Good Life”. My boss was visibly embarrassed and definitely pissed at me. But hey, wanna take credit for my work? Go ahead! Haha.\n\nIt really taught me a valuable lesson: never let anyone take credit for the things you do, especially in front of Mark Hamil",

        "text": "Backstory: This happened about 15 years ago. I was an event manager for a venue space and several hotels. I worked for the hotels but ran the event space.\n\nWhen I started, the event venue was in the red, I pulled them into the black in about 8 months. At month 11, the event space team hired a sales manager to help bring in additional business. The new sales manager (we'll call her Karen), would constantly double-book pro-bono events. Causing my paying customers to have to move dates or worse move venues. This went on for a few months.\n\nHere's where Malicious Compliance comes into play. At month 14 the owners of both properties decided to split their partnership, which meant my role was being eliminated. I was given a 2-week notice to wrap up any events I was working on. Well, the conference center owners didn't like countersigning contracts. They wanted the customer to sign, but they never counter-signed unless it was requested by the customer's attorney. (I didn't realize when I started how bad this was from a legal standpoint for the customer.) So, my last two weeks arrive, and I'm letting my customers know they won't be working with me anymore. I also went in and signed all the contracts I had open for the next 8 months, and sent them to each of my customers. This way, if the venue tried anything, they had a signed contract (regardless if I still worked for them. I was employed with them, and therefore, signed on behalf of them - this was how it was explained to me from legal.). \n\nHere's where Karma comes into play: About 3 years after I left, a friend sent me an article about the business. After too many pro-bono events for customers that never materialized, the company had to file for bankruptcy. They sold the property and wound up in debt. Karen did try to start her own event business. When that didn't work, she was hired back at the new venue space before being fired for not bringing in enough revenue. I don't know where she's at these days, we are not connected on LinkedIn anymore. She unconnected with me.",

        "text": "First off I would like to thank y’all for reading my posts, making me laugh with your comments, and supporting me through these ungodly events. This will be the last part of this story I have a bunch of different stories that I would love to share in the future!\n\n(Sunday, day of freedom) I pull up to my work parking lot and sit in my car for ten minutes before my shift starts, I see my annoying manager get out of his car and walk by my car looking at me with a thousand-yard stare. Finally, I decided to get out of my car, I take a deep breath and start walking, I'm inside the restaurant and a couple of the servers that I like are talking to me and saying how they are going to miss me and they congratulate me on the new job, the other servers overheard and were surprisingly also excited for me which I wasn’t expecting because I thought they didn’t like me and that’s when I realized that they weren’t trying to be mean to me or not like me it's just that they have been dealing with the manager's tantrums for over a year and are just exhausted. I had made up my mind to maliciously comply to everything he said to me that day!\n\nThe owner came in to eat with his family after church, and my manager came up to me and told me to focus on their table and no one else’s. ( he really needs to learn how to phrase his sentences better lol) so I did, for their entire stay I made sure they had all their needs covered, you need water I got you, more ketchup no problem, fresh coffee I’m your man.\nThe owner pulls me aside and thanked me for working so hard, and said that every time he would come in he would always see me doing anything I could to help. He thanked me again and calls over the annoying manager and proceeded to ask “why is op leaving us, you never really told me why?” Then my manager in his usual condescending tone tells me to tell him all of my reasons why I'm leaving. ( i never told him any reasons) so obviously I complied, I told the owner everything  I told him how he treats the staff, how I'm only making $8/hr, how he just sits on his computer for hours and doesn’t help with any of the manager duties, etc… my managers face was blood red but not out of anger but out of anxiety and damn near shitting himself. The owner looked at me and told me I can go somewhere else and that he needed to speak with him alone. The owner ripped him a new one which I thought was impossible since they were church buddies, but the church doesn’t protect you from being yelled at.\n\nThe day was coming to an end I only had two hours left until freedom and my manager was super pissed at me he came up to me and said “I don’t want to see you or talk to you” so again I took my orders and ran with them. Every time he would walk out of the office i would run to the bathrooms or outside to hide from him since he didn’t want to see me or when he would approach me asking me questions I would walk away not saying a word, I was a mute ninja for those two hours.\n\nI had only twenty minutes left so I started to say goodbye to all the people and wish them the best and hopefully after telling the owner how the manager isn’t all that great, maybe hell get fired.\nAs I was clocking out the manager comes up to me and wants to shake my hand, I don’t say anything and I walk out. I drove off, into the sunset.\n\n(Monday) Today was my first day working at the new job, and when I say it's great that would be an understatement because this job is amazing, it's so relaxed and chill all of the managers are so funny and nice. There was one point two of the managers were doing Patrick Bateman impersonations to see who did the best one. Sunny days always have to be ruined by thunderstorms, my ex-boss calls me and tell me he posted the schedule for the next week and tells me I need to be there I laugh in his face and tell him for $25/hr and free food ill do it gladly and hang up on him before he can get his response out.\n\nTuesday was the last day he tried to make contact with me but I blocked his number because I didn’t want to hear him cry and complain to me. \n\nThank y’all for reading and interacting with me throughout this. I will post more story’s in the future if y’all want to listen.\nagain thank you.",

The company provided a vehicle and it was stocked with hardware, tools, and spare parts to fix small problems.

Traffic was horrible and if I left after 655 (30-45 min drive before 7, 1.5-2.5 hours after 7) I was late. The later I left the more traffic compounded. Often I would stop at the warehouse to pick up parts that were ordered and get to clock in the extra 15-20 minutes. I requested to be paid for my time for some of the commute as well due to the increased traffic after and was denied. \nThen I found out legally I’m paid after my first stop regardless of what the company said. \nNot only did I start clocking in at 8am at the warehouse, I would stop there every day for one reason or another…I’m not late I’m at the warehouse! \nthey changed their tune and started paying for my time in traffic. \nI went back to my 645am warehouse stop and tallied the OT every day for the remainder of my time there",

        "text": "So my Jr year of hs, which was in 2014, my english teacher was an absolute bitch, and that's probably the most polite thing I can say about her. She was one of those teachers who would not let students leave to go to the bathroom, unless it was an \"emergency\". Let's call her Miss Bitch.\n\nAnyway, there was a day when the class was working on group projects and one of my friends, and classmates, whom we will call Maddy, told me and the group that she would be back because she needed to go to the bathroom. Maddy went up to Miss Bitch and asked to go the bathroom but denied it because she could \"tell it wasn't an emergency. You can go when class is over. Until then, just wait it out and hold it.\" Maddy went ahead and sat back down with us and had that very concerned look on her face.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later or so, Maddy's concerned face turned scared and she kept her hands down there and legs crossed. Another girl in the group asked if she was ok, but she didn't wanna say it out loud. She kept quiet the whole rest of class. I was thinking that she accidentally pissed herself. But I was so wrong.\n\nOnce class was over, Maddy started waddling her way out. I was putting things in my backpack and I heard Miss Bitch ask Maddy if she was ok. I turned my head out of curiosity and saw Maddy spread her legs and noticed blood stains between her legs. And to make it even worse, Maddy was wearing white jeans so it was VERY noticeable. Miss Bitch had the audacity to ask her why she didn't put in a tampon. Maddy calmly told her, \"YOU are the one who said to wait until class. So I did. So therefore, I had my period right on my chair. That tamp was all I needed when I asked to excuse myself to the restroom.\"\n\nI walked out with Maddy, and she started crying because she was too embarrassed to be going around the school with white pants with blood stains \"down there\". Since I'm a male, I couldn't say I felt her pain in the slightest, but I stayed with her as she called her mom and asked to bring over another pair of pants while she hid away from the rest of the hs crowd during passing period.\n\nWhen Maddys mom arrived, she met her outside and told her the story. To say Maddys mom was furious was an understatement. She told her to get changed and meet her in the main office. She then thanked me for being there for her and I went onto my next class.\n\nFew days later, I noticed that Miss Bitch was not in class, but instead a sub teacher, whom we will call Mr. Relief. And Maddy wasn't there either (can't blame her at all). Mr. Relief said that he would be our english teacher until Miss Bitch was back. A week later, he told us that he was gonna be our teacher for the remainder of the year. He was literally the coolest dude ever! I learned so much more from him than Miss Bitch.\n\nMaddy got moved to a different english class, and told me that when her and her mom filed a complaint at the office, Miss Bitch got reprimanded and was suspended from teaching, then was fired from the school a week later, or something like that. All that mattered to me and her was that we won't be dealing with Miss Bitch anymore.\n\nSo teachers, if you are reading this, please let your students take a few minutes to go take a piss or put in their feminine products if you don't want them to bleed all over the class, especially if it's a 100 minute long class period.\n\nGod rest Maddy's soul. She passed away in 2020 due to asthma complications.\n\nTLDR, student needs to go to the bathroom, teacher tells student to wait until class ends, then has her period in class. Teacher gets fired for letting this happen",

This guy would come in every week and buy three cases of cheap spray paint. I asked him what he did with that much paint. He worked at an apartment complex and handed those to his crew and they'd spot spray any chipped paint they found. What a lot of people don't realize is those cans only look the same on the outside. That cheap can only covered 5sqft. The more expensive covered 15sqft. The cheap can was $1 and the expensive was $2.50. So I told him one day he could save money by buying one case of the expensive rather than 3 of the cheap. He yelled at me that $2.50 was more that $1. I tried to explain it had 3 times the paint for less than 3 times the cost. He wasn't having any of my funny math. So I told him thanks for your business sir! The  every week he came in, I told him thanks for your business.",

        "text": "So this is a story from someone I know. I’ve known this person for years and while I don’t work with them I’ve seen this story play out more or less step by step. I know several people involved, but I’m going to tell it from the point of view of the person I know the best. \n\nSo many years ago this person, lets just refer to them as Person. Person got a really great job working for a fortune 500 company. Not going to give any more specifics. But the company offered many benefits for their employees. They treated their employees like people and not like numbers. They offered a yearly raise to anyone who worked there. This was meant to do several things, first of all it was meant to keep up with inflation so that employees wouldn’t have to stress about money. I’m sure a lot of you know the struggle, waiting for min wage to be updated so you can start saving money to hold over till the next wage increase. No the company was ahead of the curve. \n\nOn top of that when they did start hiring new employees for more they increased the wage of anyone with that specific position by the same amount to keep older employees from earning less than newer employees. They offered many many other benefits aswell. Basically an awesome place to work for. \n\nUnfortunately it’s a small town and the company wanted to expand that specific branch of operations. They couldn’t do it here so they chose to move out. They sold the branch office building along with the product that Person worked to another smaller company. When it was sold then person went with it, the old company made the new company sign a contract which guaranteed that the yearly bonus would stay around along with several other similar benefits. \n\nNew company wasn’t around very long and ended up expanding as well, they did the same thing, sold the location and product to another company. Unfortunately they didn’t care as much about their employees and only treated them well because of contractual obligations. So when they sold the location and product it did not come with a contract. New new company did care a little bit about employees, but ended raises and all of that. They would listen to employee complaints but that was about it. They weren’t around long either before the scummiest company came in and bought them out. \n\nSo new company comes in and buys them out and immediately starts changing policies and shifting everything up to make everyone jobs harder. Person and their team members got use to it and kept going. Now here’s the thing about Person. Person works on a team of specialists, there are only about 12 people on the team and a manager that’s over them. Well there was, I’ll get to that. \n\nThis team doesn’t require any special education or anything but it does require a several week training course and several months of acclimation. The product is extremely delicate, and the customers for this product are extremely demanding. They more or less require perfection, anything short and no money. You must watch every single word that you say to these customers or they might write you off permanently. However, this is an extremely valuable product and the company makes a lot of money from it. Or they did atleast. \n\nLets speed forward about 10-15 years The company has only found new ways to treat their employees less like humans since they took over and are somehow getting away with it. Turnover is high, but as long as they have high-school grads looking for a job then they can keep their building full. Unfortunately Person and their team have asked for a raise several times at this point, they were always being turned down because they are earning “at market value” for their position. Looked it up and market value is determined by a simple equation that takes into account other people in your profession at your experience level and with your job title within about 100 miles and calculates average wage for them. Considering the extreme specialty of this position and being located in a remote region “market value” is determined by calculating the average wage of everyone on Persons team. Basically the company was saying “shut up we aren't giving you a raise.” \n\nNow, something to understand person and their team members weren't that disappointed not to get a raise every year. However they were now making only a little more than a new-higher with the company, and there are other companies that do similar but less specialized work in the area but start people out at with a higher wage then person is making at this point. I literally knew high-school grads with 0 work experience that made more than person did. Now at this point person has about 20+ years of experience working this specific product. And the least experienced person on their team had been working it for 12+ years. \n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was an annual investors meeting that was streamed live to the entire company. Person, working on a small team was invited to take a few hours off to watch the meeting. It was kind-of a reward for them for preforming so well. The company shot themselves in the foot with this one, though it was already starting to go south anyways, they just sped it up a little. \n\nSo to put this into perspective for you guys the company total profit for that year (profit not earnings) was a little over 1.2 billion. Out of that 1.2 billion Persons team of 12 people (in a company hieing tens of thousands mind you) these twelve people (and a manager) brought in about 480 million. That’s a little over a third of the companies total profits for the entire year. For those that don’t like math, that’s about 40 million per person of pure profit. Person specifically earned a little over 60 million alone. The lowest earner on the team was over 20 million. \n\nSeeing that they were single handedly responsible for over a third of the companies total profit for the year the entire team got together and demanded a raise. The manager actually put that in before they even said anything, even their manager thought it was wrong. They demanded $20 an hour. They actually only wanted half of that, but since they were being low-balled and completely unappreciated by the company for the work that they did, the put in a higher number. BTW $10 is about the amount they would have been making with their yearly bonus had it never been discontinued. \n\nAs you might expect the company being money hungry came back with the same response as usual, didn’t even try to negotiate. They asked several more times over the course of a few weeks threatening to quit if they didn’t get a raise and the company basically just said “Go on, anyone can do your Job.”\n\nQue malicious compliance. They didn’t all quit only 3 of the 12, which if you’ve been keeping up would add up to on average 120 million dollars over one year. But that’s not all actually what they did ended up turning out even worst for the company. The rest of the team all agreed to only work their minimum requirements. The company had minimum requirements that everyone had to meet, this team up to this point being proud of the work they put in consistently exceeded the requirements many times over. They would compete to see who could preform the best, the lowest earner on this team often exceeded minimum requirements by three times over. \n\nAt the end of the year the company had to painfully explain to investors why their highest earning department was now preforming at less than half what it did the previous year, they came up with some stupid explanations. They still refused to give a raise though, instead what they decided to do was raise their minimum requirements. At first the team kept up, but eventually out of aggravation when their constant requests for a raise were denied about half of the team requested transfer off. They were transferred to other depts and replaced with brand new employees the most experienced of which had been with this company for about a year. These new employees struggled to keep up with the minimum requirements, which kept getting raised to meet stock holder expectations. Eventually original member on the team had either quit or transferred to another dept even the manager. \n\nThis left the team with only new employees who had absolutely no idea what they were doing, they completely alienated the vast majority of their former customers almost over night and if that wasn’t’ enough, because they could not meed the extremely high demands of the company (still only a fraction of what the original team was preforming) they were either let go or transferred to another dept and replaced after only a few months on the team. Even hieing several times the number of employees on that team did nothing. When they reported an earnings of 80 million from that team the company got so fed up with it that they just sold the product to another company for an enormous loss. \n\nUnfortunately this isn’t one of those “The company drove themselves out of business” stories but I still think it’s pretty funny and I like to tell it to all of my new friends. I also use it to warn anyone who might be considering going to this company to work. Honestly, you’d think that if someone earns that much profit for your company you’d atleast try to keep them around.",

Essentially, you rode around in an SUV and answered 911 calls, improving the stats because the \"response time\" to the house was faster (then a full ambulance got there when they could).\n\nThing is, it was lonely work - you didn't have a partner, you didn't get to chat with nurses and doctors at the hospital, and you never got to go back to base. So, shockingly, it wasn't popular and most of us decided to go back to our regular partners. Also, it required an extra training program put on by the service.  \nBut... the service had promised big performance to the city investing... no paramedics on the SUVs, no program... So they decided to force those of us that had volunteered back onto the SUVs, irritating us and our partners. We had volunteered in good faith to help out with the understanding we could go back after the 6 months we committed to.\n\nTime goes on and we're all weary and bitter, and the union can't figure out how to put an end to it. A sloppy supervisor wants to try again to recruit more SUV medics and goes ahead and quickly writes an email advising that another training session is going to be run for anyone interested in the SUV program AND, just so they know the numbers they have, anyone who wanted back in from our cohort, \"must reapply\"...\n\n\"OKAY!\" says the union, and since language in an email, from a supervisor, is binding, they quickly told those of us that wanted out to just ignore the email and not reapply. It wasn't how the management meant it, but just like that we had our loophole and were all finally free... And damn sure never volunteered for another project again.\n\nTLDR: management bullies us into working a position we don't want and accidentally screws themselves in a single email with a single phrase, allowing us to escape their demands.\n\nAs an aside, unions really can be an enormous help to the individual workers, struggling to figure out how to get fair treatment from managers.",

        "text": "This happened about ten years ago when I was working at a Pizza restaurant as a waiter. I'll not mention the name, but it is very popular in the U.S. This was in a small southern town, and one of the versions of this restaurant that had a substantial dining room—for a pizza place. \n\nGenerally, I went out of my way to find my customers the best deals on their pizzas. I didn't believe in running up a huge bill to try and milk a higher percentage. Well, one day this changed. I was waiting tables per usual and a customer came with a very rude attitude. I'll call him Rudy. Among other things he insisted I \"hurry up\" as soon as he ordered his drink and questioned why I, a male in my early 20's at the time, was a waiter since \"waiting tables is a job for high school girls.\" (To his credit, this small town didn't have many sit-down restaurants, the majority of waitresses in the town were women and HS girls). \n\nI took this particularly personally since I had worked hard for this job and I was darn good at it. It came time for Rudy to order his pizza. He wanted to order a \"medium hand tossed with everything.\" Now I knew what Rudy meant. People had, and I presume still have, various terms they use for specialty pizzas. When someone said \"everything\" or \"combination\" or some variation, they meant a supreme pizza (pepperoni, sausage, beef, mushrooms, peppers, and onions.\" Every other time, I would seek clarity and ask if they meant our supreme pizza. But not this time, this time I thought it was time for some malicious compliance. Here's how it went. \n\nMe: \"You want one medium hand tossed pizza, with EVERYTHING on it, is that correct sir?\"\n\nRudy: \"Did I stutter, it's not a hard order. Yes I want a medium hand tossed with everything. Think you can handle that?!\" \n\nMe: \"Of course, sir, I will have that right out to you!\"\n\nWhat Rudy didn't realize was, \"supreme\" pizzas did not have \"everything,\" not by half. In reality we had almost 2 dozen different toppings at this place. It's been a while, but off the top of my head I remember sausage, Italian sausage, pepperoni, bacon, Canadian bacon, chicken, bell peppers, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, onions, black olives, green olives, pineapple, tomatoes, and anchovies. So I went to the computer and began building one medium pizza with \"everything.\" (I also made it a point to start from a blank base, and not build from a supreme reconfiguration, just for a little added maliciousness in my malicious compliance. \n\nOnce I was done inputting this monstrosity my shift lead noticed the ticket and came back to me and asked:\n\nShift Leader: \"OP, what in the world is this?\"\n\nMe: \"Customer asked for a pizza with everything on it Shift Leader.\" \n\nShift Leader: \"You know he probably meant a supreme right?\"\n\nMe: \"I double check and verified, Shift Leader. He told me multiple times he wanted a medium hand tossed pizza with everything.\" \n\nSeemingly satisfied with this answer, my shift lead went back to the cooks and told them to make it. This thing turned out GROSS. It was so piled on with toppings the cooks literally had to press it down. Because there were so many toppings, the standard amount of cheese did nothing to cover them like a traditional pizza should. It was effectively just a hot pile of meat and vegetables when it got out of the oven. \n\nOnce it was out, I put on my best \"professional\" smile and delivered the pizza to the table—I had to use two hands it was so heavy! When he looked at his pizza he did not have the volatile reaction I expected, it was more a mix of confusion, disappointment, and bewilderment and then stern rejection. \n\nRudy: \"What is this OP?\"\n\nMe: \"Your pizza, sir, you asked for a pizza with 'everything' on it.\"\n\nRudy: \"That's not what I wanted! I wanted a supreme!\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, that's not what you asked for, you asked for a pizza with everything on it.\"\n\nAt this time, I honestly expected him to fight more and demand to see a manager. But, seemingly realizing I had given him EXACTLY what he asked for, he just sort of begrudgingly accepted it. I asked him if I could get him anything else and he said no. I left and kept an eye on him. He poked around at a slice for a few minutes, but obviously found it unappetizing. The best part was when I got to bring him his ticket, with each of those toppings rang in individually. Rudy ended up being charged $45 for one medium pizza with everything. I was like the cat that ate the canary the rest of my shift!\n\nFallout: \n\nI hate to disappoint anybody who may be wanting a huge fallout, but the man had effectively resigned himself to his fate. He paid the bill without incident, though he did stiff me on the tip, as I had expected. I never saw the man again. I later told my shift lead the full story. They laughed and acknowledged the guy deserved it, but told me not to make a habit of that. To which I agreed. \n\nHope you enjoyed!",

        "text": "I'll do my best to keep this short \n\nI work in theater and right now I'm in a small community show. There is \"the kid\" who has never done anything like this before, and I have been trying to give him tips and help him out here and there without overtly giving another actor notes. (A big no-no in most theater settings and also just annoying.) \n\nUsually he ignores advice by anyone, but people are genuinely trying to show him the ropes and also there are a ton of unspoken rules in theater- and its not fair to be annoyed by someone who doesn't know them so people either give you the occasional heads up or sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself. \n\nWell. Today he was not paying attention and the director told him us to do something, I nudged him and told him what she said (I genuinely thought he didn't hear her) and he yelled \"I know what she said! I'm doing something! Don't tell me what to do!\" \n\nHa. Okay. Also it's worth noting that unless you're bleeding out- when the director tells you it's time to do something all other activities and side convos should immediately cease- and in general you shouldn't be doing anything but listening for direction anyway. \n\nA little bit later we were told to run a bit of fight choreography and he was goofing off and joking around. I asked if he would like to keep it half speed or full and he was joking saying the director told us to \"speed the whole act up\" I was trying to say that it wouldn't apply to a fight bc safety is more important and we can keep it half speed if he is more comfortable- he interrupts me to tell me he has never felt unsafe about a piece of metal that isn't even sharp. (A stage combat rapier) \n\nAgain. Okay. \n\nSo normally during our first fight I suggest we take it slow. The director tells me I should be practicing more and it's time to speed it up. I don't argue or throw him under the bus.... but I'm very confident about this piece. I just agree and move on. During this I also tell him what's coming next when he gets stuck- which happens about 3 times.\n\nWe begin our fight full speed as he requested. We get 3 moves in before he is stuck. I do not \"tell him what to do\" and just stand there looking at him until he figures it out. 3 moves later and he is stuck again and I just stand there, waiting for him to do the thing I need to react to. Next he goes for is the wrong one which could have been dangerous if I didn't block it so I call a hold and request we go back to half speed. \n\nIt ended up looking obvious that I know the choreo and he was getting lost since we were not doing it slow and he was pausing to think. I won't be telling him what to do anymore. Sure was pushy of me.",

        "text": "Not my first post here. I could post about 10 a day. Some people say I’m too petty and I wear that as a badge of honor. \n\nAnywhoo, the story….\n\n\n\nI live in good ol’ small town America. Everyone knows everyone, the cops know the people in town, so on and so forth. My town is very small and therefore doesn’t have its own police force so we’re under the jurisdiction of the county sherriff. As it happens, I happen to attend church with one of our county’s deputies. \n\nAbout a month ago, my neighbor took objection to the fact that I parked my pickup in my front yard instead of in my garage. I needed to do this to have space in the garage to work on my wife’s car. My truck was probably a good 30 yards from the property line. \n\nHe came out his front door and sarcastically hollered, “Do you think you could park a little closer to my driveway?” \n\nI replied “I’m at least 30 yards or so from the property line, I’m not moving my truck.” \n\nNow for some reason, this thunderhead took exception to my answer. He storms over to my yard and gets in my face. \n\n“Son, if you don’t move your truck, then I guess well have to let the sherrif’s office handle this!” \n\nDear folks, one thing you should know about me is this: if you think I’m not willing to escalate the situation, you are more than welcome to test that assumption at your earliest convenience. Do NOT challenge me because I WILL call your bluff.\n\nAs quickly as I could, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and called the aforementioned deputy. On speaker of course. \n\nMe: “Hey, Buckwheat” (not his actual name.) \n\nBuckwheat: “What’s up?” \n\nMe: “You on duty today?” \n\nBuckwheat: “Sure enough” \n\nMe: “Awesome, could you run by my house real quick, I’d like to clear up a little land dispute.” \n\nYou’ve never seen a man move so fast in your life. The way my neighbor ran back into his house, he may as well have been trying out for the NFL. It took Deputy Buckwheat about 5 minutes to arrive. When he got there, I explained the situation to him. He just stood there, trying to figure out why my neighbor made such a big deal about it. \n\nBuckwheat goes over and knocks on his door. They talked for about 3 minutes. He came back and said he wouldn’t be giving me any more trouble. \n\nIt’s truly a wonder to me to know that there are tree stumps down in a Louisiana swamp with more intelligence than some people. I guess some people are just too stubborn to learn to mind their own business. As my grandfather used to say, “If you ain’t a plunger, boy stay out of it. You’ll get killed.”",

        "text": "Ahhh, so much malice, so little time. Seriously, this has got to be the sixteenth time I’ve done mc this week, and the third I’ve decided to write about. \n\nIn my daily dealings with customers going through the DRIVE thru we will encounter many people who walk up to our particular “Mendys” location and either beg for food, or beg to be able to order. When this does happen, I want to encourage hitchhiking. Anything to prevent us from having the bejeezus scared out of us when they pop up kick whackamole. It doesn’t help that everyone seems to be wearing earth tones. Phoenix is the next Oregon, evidently. \n\nIt’s usually a fifty-fifty proposition, and 100 percent manager-dependent.  I don’t wanna be liable for someone getting ran over. Run over? Grammarly done did me wrong. \n\nThis time my manager said okay. \n\nI try to ask what he’d like but he interrupts to have a lecture about lobbies being closed. I explainogized the best I could, then finally got to get his order. \n\n“Yeah gimme a burger and fries.”\n\n“What size.?”\n\n“Reguler “\n\n“Okay so a small?”\n\n“Yeah”\n\n“Okay that’ll be$ 9.21”\n\nHe takes offense to this “aww funk no don’t you got a cheap burger?!”\n\n“That’s our junior cheeseburger.  Would u like that?”\n\n“That’s what I funkin said isn’t it?!”\n\nIt took all i had not to say anything outside of the total, which was a merciful $5.41. I told him it’d be right out, we need to make fresh fries so it’ll be a second. He said \n\n“Whatever “\n\nNot Thanks. Not No Problem. Not Hey would you like me to wait out if the line of traffic seeing where I’m causing a safety hazard? Just “Whatever” . At least it wasn’t swear-riddled this particular sentence. \n\nAs the fries were being cooked I thought about getting this guy out of the drive thru quickly so I watched the fries like a hawk. Ourfryers tend to over cook the fries for most peoples taste so we pull thirty seconds early. I decided to tai chi the situation and fight anger with kindness. I gave him a medium instead of small. \n\nNo soon as I’m handing the bag out is he rummaging through napkins and ketchup to amazingly find something t yell about. \n\n“Hey my MAN yo my MAN!” He yelled directly at me trying to get my attention he already had. \n\nThen things got interesting. He turned to his imaginary passenger in his very-non-existent car and said\n\n “see ? What I tell you.? This emmeffer put in medium fries that’s why this too expensive”\n\nHe then turned back to me and said “my man ! I said small fries! Now what’re you gonna do? You’re gonna make it right that’s what!”\n\nEnter malicious compliance.\n\nI asked if I could see the receipt. Even though I knew what the problem was, I pretended to really scan this baby. I then had a sudden “epiphany”. \n\n“Ohhhhhhh I see what happened sir could I see those fries?”\n\nI took them back and tossed them , then got him what he ordered; a small container of fries. \n\nIn my syrupy voice I apologized /s incerely and made it right.\n\n“I don’t know WHAt I was thinking giving you a medium instead of what you ordered. Have a great night!”\n\nI’m not sure how this guys imaginary friend reacted, but the look on HIs face was classic, and all I hoped for.",

        "text": "I was working for a manufacturer years ago, it was a small operation run by a husband (CEO) and wife with a sister business of a front end platform that was run by the wife's brother. The husband's mom and some cousins also worked there between the two businesses. \nWith an operation like this you had the typical micromanagement from CEO, minimum wage pay for top dollar performance expectations, and the general nonsense you can expect in a set up like this. \nI had this job while in college and needed to build my resume, they let me have a flexible schedule so I could leave early for my night classes and when I had midterms and finals so I knew I had to stick it out. After about 6 months of working there my job responsibilities grew tremendously, but my salary did not. There was a high turnover rate in the office from the \"we're a family\" environment that meant actual family got special treatment and everyone else was expected to do a crazy amount of work without getting any credit. \nOne of my friends (we'll call her Katy) was looking for work and my company was hiring, I told her what she was getting into but as a recent college grad looking for office experience she decided to give it a shot. First, my referral bonus never came even after she had worked there for 90 days and I was told that I shouldn't inquire about it because I referred someone to help the company not to get the extra money. I wasn't in a position to push so I didn't. \nI trained Katy in her role as she was taking some of my old responsibilities. Well the CEO and the wife didn't like how much time the two of us spent talking to each other or how much time we spent away from our desks, which was genuinely us using the restroom, and getting water. \nThis made no sense because I handled product onboarding and Katy suggested products for curated events so it was important that she knew what new products were coming out and when she could start promoting them so that stock wouldn't sit in the warehouse. We separately had meetings with the CEO and office manager putting us on probation for this behavior. \nCue malicious compliance, we stop talking as much in the office effectively cutting me off  from curated events and making it impossible for Katy to use our new products on the upcoming events (events could be scheduled anywhere from a week to several months in advance so it was a great way to boost sales and visibility for our new items).\nMy friend ended up getting fired for having a brain and questioning some of the stupid policies. Also for doing something so outrageous as taking her unpaid lunch hour, showing up at 9 and leaving at 5. \nNormally I would've gone back into the platforms to curate events until they found someone to take over the role but I was petty. I had been there for a little over a year, I was training employees, teaching myself the ins and outs of all our retailers back ends to upload products, coordinating with our factories overseas, the freight companies, and our warehouse so that products would be live as soon as we had stock and was still getting paid like I did for the minimal role I had when I got hired. So not my job, not my  problem. \nFast forward a few months, the CEO decides to show up to work on the office floor instead of working out of his private office (whenever he was on the floor he was always super loud and disruptive to the general flow). I hear him talk about sales from the past few months specifically about sales from events, so naturally my ears perk up. He starts getting louder \"I don't get it, there's this huge decline in sales. None of our new products are getting any traction.\" I haven't been addressed so I keep tapping away at my computer and act oblivious. \nHe calls over the office manager and they start hashing it out \"six months ago the sales for our new items went down significantly\" (I'm thinking yeah duh that's when you told me and Katy to stop talking. The initial data that was supplied with product photos and descriptions weren't clear it would've been a very long process for Katy to sift through the new products to try and match them to events as opposed to what we used to do which was she would tell me the theme and what she was looking for and I'd get her data on a short list of items that she could review to match to said events as opposed to dumping 100 products on her.)  \"then three months ago they became almost non-existent, sales have dropped almost 70%  with these events.\" (Three months ago is when Katy got fired.) Eventually the two of them piece together that they need to blame whoever is curating events and the CEO starts asking everyone in the office \"whose responsibility is it to work on events?\"\nFinally it gets to a point where I can't stay quiet, the office is too small and I play too big of a role in product management so I chime in \"oh wasn't that Katy's responsibility?\" \nCEO replies \"she hasn't worked here in three months,you mean to tell me no one has been submitting products for three months!?\" He is LIVID and it's clear that I am now in the path of his rage. \n\"Why has no one been handling this???\" Everyone is kind of looking around and the office manager (let's call her Karen) starts shifting the blame onto me since technically Katy was in \"my department\". Once the finger pointing started I was prepared to defend myself. \n\"Well Karen I thought you were the one who was in charge of managing and keeping track of every employees role.\" So Karen replies \"I am, but you knew this is an important part of our sales and marketing.\"\nI reply with \"the week before she was let go didn't you specifically get all of her passwords and a complete list of all of her tasks?\" Karen replies \"yes\" she is clearly concerned with where I'm going with this. \n\"And after she was let go did you communicate to me that those tasks were now my responsibility.\" \nKaren : \"Well no but I shouldn't have had to!\"\nMe: \"but you're in charge of delegating tasks and making sure all work is assigned to employees. Are you implying that I was supposed to know that you had a list of tasks unassigned? Why would I assume that you didn't delegate those to another team member when that's an essential part of your role?\"\nNeedless to say while Karen was very annoyed with me, but I wasn't taking the fall. \nThey didn't ask me to curate events, Karen handled that which got them to hire another person very quickly because it was too much work for her on top of her other duties. The story of me and the new girl needs its own post so I'll end this one here. \nTldr: office manager and CEO let go a very productive employee for stupid reasons and then discover six months later no one's doing her job because they never delegated it to anyone else.",

My neighbors will tell me when she’s out so I can take video because we’re all scared of her dogs and don’t trust her. \n\nWell, I got back to my place after a really early morning at work and saw a human sized 💩 right by my planter. This wench has a great dane and I know that was his poop. So, I scooped it up, walked over to her place, and dumped it on her patio and walked away. \n\nCurrently putting up security cameras to catch all the stuff I can’t.",

        "text": "So a few years ago I was an engineer for one of the largest bread makers in the UK. We worked as a team of 4 including the team leader. Our plant had 3 production lines with a combined output of 220 loaves a minute. \n\nOur engineering manager had just been sacked and we were given some other pointless manager, who could only manage numbers not people. We all disliked him as he'd pushed good engineer's out of the department as well as stabbing operators in the back and getting them sacked.\n\nThis was his first order:\nEngineers are not to be in the workshop unless working on something, or shift handover.\nEngineers are to be assigned a production line each with the spare looking after the 12 slicers and baggers. \nEngineers are to patrol the lines unless on break, no deviations allowed \n\nAnd this is where our malicious compliance came in.\n\n Due to the large scale manufacturing, there was a lot of heavy equipment. Some jobs could occupy all 4 of us for manual labour. We were also differently skilled. Some mechanical, some electrical and me as the sole multiskilled and software tech on our shift. The way the bread is produced, if one part of the line goes down (eg oven) then all the bread on the conveyors, proofer and mixer has about 5 to 10 minutes before it becomes scrap.\n\nWe stuck to our orders and all agreed, if we saw another engineer having to deal with a job that we'd all not help. We all agreed not to bust our balls, or create unnecessary work for the ops. If a line had a mechanic, but had an electrical issue it would have to wait until the next break rotation which could be 4 hours away. \n\nAfter one shift the efficiency of the line dropped from an average of 75% to 40. And the scrap rate went from 25 to 50 percent. The bakery lost a shit ton of money that shift. It carried on for the night shift, then the assigned areas was abolished and never spoken about again the following morning",
