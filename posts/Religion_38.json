        "text": "I often hear the followers of certain large religions distinguish culture from religion, with the idea that religion is more 'pure' and universal than any particular culture. However, when I think about world religions as a whole (both small and large) I often notice that language, culture, and religion are all closely bound with one another to varying degrees (and depending on the religion or sect).\n\nTake Islam, for example. Its scripture was addressed to humanity and meant to be universal, but it was revealed in **Arabic**, and most Muslims would say that the original is in untranslated Arabic. If 'God' chose Arabic as the language of his last-and-best revelation to humanity, *that privileges Arabic* a whole lot over all other languages. Religious expressions in Islam such as \"Alhamdulillah\", \"masha'allah\", \"as-salamu-alaykum\", the shahada (declaration of faith), funerary prayers, and many others are always in Arabic. The hijab and niqab (both Arabic words) have their origins in the history of Arabia, but spread with religion to many other cultures of the world. The thawb is sometimes associated with clothing for Muslim men, and--you guessed it--also has Arabian origins. The Hajj and Ramadan fasting have roots in pre-Islamic Arab culture as well.  I would posit that one can't separate Islam from Arab cultural roots, though Islam *can* be integrated with other cultures, too.\n\nSikhism, like Islam, also shows many signs of being ethno-religious and completely tied to Punjabi Indian culture, though there have been non-Punjabi Sikhs as well. The Guru Granth Sahib, Sikh greetings and expressions, recitation of prayers, and kirtan (devotional music) are all in Punjabi. The turban worn by Sikh men derives from Indian culture. If you were to watch the 'Basics of Sikhi' YouTube channel, you'd find that the speakers frequently interject whole sentences of Punjabi into an otherwise English dialogue or monologue. In spite of all this, Sikhism also considers its message to be universal Truth.\n\nYou can find more examples of the culture-religion nexus in Hinduism, Chinese religions, and Shinto as well. Notably, indigenous religious beliefs, and ancient Pagan religions, were entirely part of their societies' cultures, such that the religions were not given distinct names. \n\nBut are there any religions which are less culturally entrenched? It seems that Christianity, Buddhism, and Baha'i Faith are less tied to their cultures of origin (Judea, India, and Iran, respectively).",

        "text": "A few decades years ago some forms of watered down Buddhist practices became widely popular in the West. Meditation, terms like Karma, etc. became popular and well known by many younger westeners. Of course, the actual values, rituals and beliefs of Buddhists were still obscure as they are today.\n\nFor instance, not long ago I found most Buddhist scholls opposed or at least discouraged infanticide, abortion, and other things that I only used to associate with American Conservative Christians, Orthodox Jews and Muslims. They also had political influence, as Buddhist monks helped to make infanticide illegal in Japan just a few centuries ago, not to mention they influenced many Kings and Emperors. However, those are not the values and beliefs seen in the West as \"Buddhist\", and the Westeners often see Far Eastern religions are \"progressive\" by default (which means anything that conveniently fits current Western values), which is odd.\n\nThese last years I observed now people seem too have moved to more fetishize more Hindu beliefs and practices, specially after the rise of Veganism in the West (I also remember the shift from suing 'Vegetarian' to using 'Vegan'), rather than Buddhism.\n\nWhy does this happen? Why do westeners often see foreign religions as trendy or somehow more \"spiritual\" or \"progressive\" than their own? After all, you can easily find an Episcopalian denomination far more progressive and opening than the typical Buddhist or Hindu school, and not change your culture or beliefs as much.\n\nBy the way, I do not judge this as good or bad. I just see it as cultural appropriation at worse, but at best it is just people exploring other belief systems.",

        "text": "In the Hebrew Bible animal sacrifice was common, even before any Temple was built, and during the Tabernacle. During the Temple, it is also clear that animal sacrificed continued, and it was vital to pay for the sins of the Jewish people. After the Temple was destroyed, the sacrifice of animals stopped.\n\nChristians believe Animal Sacrifice is not needed anymore because Jesus Christ was the perfect Sacrifice, but Jewish people do not believe Jesus was the Messiah, and even if they did, they do not think that was the purpose of the Messiah anyway.\n\nMost Muslims do not seem to practice animal sacrifice, and I do not know how they atone their sins, but it seems historically they never had widespread animal sacrifice anyway.\n\nSo, **how do Jewish people today atone their sins today?** I have some theories:\n\n1. They just let sin accumulate until the Temple is built. If true, they may have almost 2000 years of accumulated sins.\n\n2. They use other methods such as prayer and fasting, but if that is the case, then why was animal sacrifice needed in the first place?\n\n3. They no longer believe in sin in the same way ancient Jewish people did during the 2nd Temple and before. This would probably imply a deep theological change, akin to that argument of Christianity, but using other arguments.\n\nI also wonder why animal sacrifice stopped after the destruction of the Temple if sacrifice was already common before the Temple in the first place.\n\nBy the way, it seems some [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurban_(Islamic_ritual_sacrifice)) and [Jewish](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/04/13/523770582/goats-are-rescued-on-their-way-to-being-sacrificed-in-jerusalem) people still sacrifice animals, but not at the scale of religions in the past.\n\nI ask about Judaism because often the sacrifice was in the name of the whole nation, which would be a remarkable event if still practiced today.",

(not his mom)\" and \"Is Yahweh actually Yaldabaoth?\" without being bombarded by a bunch of christian scholars trying to do the same thing and backing everything with colorations with the bible instead of historical facts. And always trying to paint the Canaanites, Gnostics, Pagan and Babylonians as awful and bad people when other information greatly goes against those claims. \n\nWhile there is some truth in the bible about these topics using it as the only source of historical proof is wrong and inaccurate. So im asking if anyone can give me websites or pages I can use to find information without having to deal with a bunch of Christin websites. Any help is great!",

        "text": "Modern day Muslims cannot make claims to absolute morality. The evidence for this is that Mohammad, the individual who invented Islam, took a child bride when he was in his 50's. According to writings, he both married her and years later consummated the marriage before his wife's age could be counted in double digits. This is not an attack or an insult. This is a fact one can google. Aisha was married at 6 and then slept with her when she was 9.\n\nToday, I would hope that modern day Muslims condemn the practice of child brides. I believe most do. Muslims are not awful people and by and large are quite peaceful. There's a lot that's good about them and even about their religion. However, I do not understand the mental gymnastics Muslims go through to reconcile condemning children brides versus the actions of their prophet. I do not understand how Muslims can claim morality is objective if something so clearly abhorrent was right for one person AND wrong for everyone else at the same time. Do I have it wrong? Do Muslims claim that morality is subjective?",

        "text": "In the Book of Mormon, in a book called Alma chapter 32, it says an “experiment” I would like to get other faiths perspectives on this experiment. I’ll post the last half of the chapter here. It’s an experiment on faith. I would love to hear any and all impressions. I will pair it with a little scripture in Moroni at the end.\n\n“13 And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.\n\n14 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?\n\n15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed—yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.\n\n16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.\n\n17 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.\n\n18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.\n\n19 And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?\n\n20 Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.\n\n21 And now as I said concerning faith—faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.\n\n22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.\n\n23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.\n\n24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out—now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true—\n\n25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.\n\n26 Now, as I said concerning faith—that it was not a perfect knowledge—even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.\n\n27 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.\n\n28 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.\n\n29 Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.\n\n30 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.\n\n31 And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.\n\n32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.\n\n33 And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.\n\n34 And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.\n\n35 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?\n\n36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.\n\n37 And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.\n\n38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.\n\n39 Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.\n\n40 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.\n\n41 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.\n\n42 And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.\n\n43 Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.”\n\n.\n\nThen in Moroni 10:\n\n“3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\n\n4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\n\n5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.”",

        "text": "I notice a few patterns in both Buddhism and Christianity:\n\n1. Both Christianity and Buddhism seem to try to simplify some traditional doctrine, or even skip whole traditions, but also add something new in the process. In these new movements it seems sometimes tradition is seen as an obstacle or a burden.\n\n2. It seems both movements are centralized around a person, be Buddha or Jesus, while the original religions seem to have multiple founders.\n\n3. Both movements thrived outside the land they were born in, but not as on the play they were founded. Funny enough, Jesus also said 'no prophet is accepted in his home town' (Luke 4:16-30)\n\n4. Both movements seem to not totally reject or disavow their parent religions but see themselves as \"extending\" or \"fulfilling\" them.\n\n5. Both movements eventually adopted a unique identity apart from their parent religion.\n\n6. Both movements seem to focus more on spirituality rather than ritual, legalism or tradition such as their parent religions.\n\n7. Both movements took strong hold after being adopted by royalty and that caused a and exponential boom of conversions.\n\n8. Both movements seem to give special importance to some form of monasticism.\n\n9. Both movements became universalist religions.\n\n10. Both movements seem to put emphasis on ethics, peace and harmony with the neighbor in theory. In practice we observed how the Church were not so good to heretics and how bad Buddhist treated Muslims. Regardless, Christianity was far more militaristic than Buddhism ever was, probably because Christianity was more centralized than Buddhism.\n\n11. Both movements seem to share some sacred scripture and core doctrines with their parent religions (be it karma, sin, prophecy, moksha, etc.).\n\n12. Both movements have some special respect for their parent religions in theory, but that does not mean there were no conflicts or prosecution.\n\nOf course, maybe these patterns are superficial, but I think the fact both religions are so big and so successful over countless movements before maybe proves these methods are key for a universal religion to be born.",

From my perspective and I am being truthful from the knowledge I have and humbly speaking.  I have never seen the laws of physics change. I can pray to Allah a thousand times to levitate a ping pong ball and it won't. Gravity always takes over. Now I do believe gravity is the will of Allah and whatever fundamental forces are at a deeper layer. But it is acting like a fixed rule system. It's not like today we have apples falling from the tree and the next day we are all flying like superman.\n\nFamous Islamic heretic Ibn Sina firmly believed that there are laws of nature that cannot be violated. He believed that all physical phenomena have a known cause. This meant that he found it hard to envisage supernatural events such as healing miracles and bodily resurrection. \n\nIbn Sina believed that there exists a single set of principles that can explain the nature of the physical universe, the reason for its creation, and the relationship between mind and body, and he made it his life’s work to find connections between these apparently different fields, and ultimately to discover a theory of everything. \n\nNow I don't think it's impossible for Allah to change the laws of physics, it's just that, humbly speaking, never seen it happen.

Allah applying a genetic algorithm to create different variants of creatures.](https://preview.redd.it/tm2pgiglqb1a1.png?width=4502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335c6ffabd13915cab5b03a3dfa6adca9f154a44)\n\nYou can't deny these systems. \n\nThat was nature, coming to theology it is even more scary. Like Allah not being able to forgive polytheists. \n\n&gt;Surely, Allah does not forgive that a partner is ascribed to Him, and He forgives anything short of that for whomsoever He wills. Whoever ascribes a partner to Allah commits a terrible sin.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Quran 4:48](https://quran.com/4?startingVerse=48)\n\nEven though we are physically like tiny bacteria on earth and even though the earth is a million times smaller than sand dust compared to the universe. Some act's really hurt Allah's feelings. And even though Allah could have saved everyone like playing a game with a cheat code. He didn't and in his eternal will, many people were doomed. But does it also seem like he is having an internal struggle? To save us from his own rage.\n\n&gt;Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of believers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills. And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Quran 16:93](https://quran.com/en/an-nahl/93)\n\nThere are many examples of these rules. That like a monolithic machine just doesn't change. Allah even admits this.\n\n&gt;Such has been Our way with the messengers We sent before you. And **you will find no change in Our way**.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[17:77](https://quran.com/17?startingVerse=77)\n\n Also in [***8: 38***](https://www.al-islam.org/probe-history-ashura-ibrahim-ayati/chapter-34-divine-law-unalterable#quran_ref_109435)  [***48:23***](https://www.al-islam.org/probe-history-ashura-ibrahim-ayati/chapter-34-divine-law-unalterable#quran_ref_109437)   [***35: 43***](https://www.al-islam.org/probe-history-ashura-ibrahim-ayati/chapter-34-divine-law-unalterable#quran_ref_109438) \n\nAnd what about Christian God? Damning humans by Original Sin by birth. And unable to just forgive. God would rather commit suicide than forgive. So he did kill himself to 'cleanse' us. But still, it's only those who 'believe'\n\nAnd Jewish Yahweh version of Allah. In Torah. It talks about Sheol. From my understanding, it's a dark void. Which may not be as terrifying as fire. But still bad. Although there are different views.\n\nIn Kabbalistic views where the creator is good and wants to fill the creature with pleasure seems an interesting concept. And the concept how will to bestow created will to receive. The sephirot, All the layers of creation, and how we are in a certain stage of creation. All an interesting concept and seems logical. But even in this, it's an almost fixed system.God acting pragmatically. With a plan. Playing by systems he created. Even though Jewish God treats me differently because I came out of the wrong womb.\n\nI am not worried if God of Kabbalah is true. Sometimes doubt besets me. And also how do you refute the agnostic point of view? \n\nAnd if Islam is true which I have to believe otherwise I will also be like so many souls that are destined to eternal torment. I personally have no ill feelings towards people of other religions. Met many Christians, Atheists, Hindus, few Jews. Nice people, when you meet personally. And even if they are not nice. I don't know if I could damn them to an eternity of punishment. I mean we can't grasp infinity, 1000 years, 10000 years more than enough.. But infinity. It turns my hair grey. To think about it. I am not even 30. And to be honest, even I don't know how I will end. Hopefully in a state where I love Allah and Allah loves me.  And I ask Allah to forgive me for writing this post.",

        "author": "Keith502",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/z0hw5a/why_is_the_story_of_adam_and_eve_so_similar_to/",
        "text": "One thing I have long found interesting is the similarity between the story of Adam and Eve and the ancient Greek myth involving the Titan brothers Epimetheus and Prometheus.  If you are unfamiliar with the myth, I have included a version of it below (taken from the website classicalwisdom.com):\n\n&gt;The story goes that during the creation of the universe, the earth formed out of chaos. The air collected and became transparent while the land and seas became solidified and structured. As the earth became suitable for life, the gods decided that it would be wise to bestow upon the planet creatures of life that might thrive and live through the graces of the gods.  \n \n&gt;The task of creating man and beasts was awarded to the titan brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus, whom had not been imprisoned with the other titans by Zeus. Prometheus was said to be wise and possessed the gift of foresight and often considered what would be needed several years in the future. Epimetheus was said to be rash and impulsive, unable to plan for the future and instead only cared for what had happened in the past.  \n\n&gt;The brothers set about creating life upon the earth. Epimetheus swiftly created several creatures that would live in the forests, swim in the seas and rivers, and fly through the air with the gift of flight. Epimetheus was so impulsive that he bestowed upon these creatures several gifts. Swiftness for some beasts, flight for others and the gift of strength and frightening claws for the most terrifying of creatures.  \n \n&gt;While his brother foolishly crafted creatures with little thought, Prometheus toiled diligently over the creation of man from a lump of clay. Prometheus shaped man after the image of the gods and allowed him to walk upright so that he might look towards the heavens. In some versions it is said that Epimetheus created man and Prometheus merely provided guidance. Regardless of whom the architect was, man was designed to be nobler than any other beast and was constructed so as to resemble the gods.  \n \n&gt;However upon completion of man, Prometheus discovered that his rash brother had bestowed all the gifts from the gods upon animals and had left none for humans. While the beasts possessed strength, swiftness, hardened shells and warm coats, man was left naked and weak with no means to live prosperously.  \n\n&gt;Prometheus was overcome with sadness for his creations, whom were living painfully and harshly on earth. Prometheus devised a plan to bestow upon man a great gift that will make them formidable against the beasts of the earth.  \n \n&gt;Prometheus defied the will of Zeus and traveled to Mount Olympus and stole fire from the gods, a gift that before was unknown to mankind. Some versions of the story describe how Prometheus was aided by the Goddess Hera. Other stories recall that Zeus stole fire from men and Prometheus took the fire back in defiance of Zeus.  \n\n&gt;At any rate, fire was bestowed upon mankind by Prometheus and with it came the beginning of civilization. Prometheus taught man how to craft tools from iron ore. He showed them how to plant crops and live through agriculture. Man learnt to craft weapons to defend themselves from wild animals. With fire they learnt to survive cold winters and defy the seasons. With fire man began to thrive and became superior to the animals of the wild.  \n  \n&gt;Zeus was outraged by this transgression. He set in motion plans to punish Prometheus and mankind for their obstruction of the gods’ will. The punishment he devised was twofold.  \n \n&gt;First, Zeus commanded Hephaestus, the blacksmith for the God’s, to craft a creature so beautiful that it would plague the hearts of men. From a lump of clay, Hephaestus created the form of a woman. This woman was bestowed with gifts like a pleasing voice and unmatched beauty by the gods. They named her Pandora and she was commanded to marry Prometheus’s brother Epimetheus.  \n\n&gt;Epimetheus married Pandora despite Prometheus’ warnings to be wary of accepting gifts from Zeus. The warning was well placed. Before Pandora departed Olympus she was given a box or, in some versions of a story, a jar. She was warned by the gods to never open the box under any circumstances.  \n\n&gt;At first Pandora abided by this rule, however her curiosity was soon overwhelmed. She opened the box out of blind curiosity, so that she might see what it held.  \n\n&gt;Immediately, innumerable evil creatures flew out of the box and began to disperse themselves across the earth. Creatures like disease, famine and plague sprang from the box and began to wander the earth and haunt mankind. Pandora, in her fear, quickly shut the box. She closed the vessel on one last creature before it could escape, Hope.  \n\n&gt;As a result, it is said that while evil haunts this world, mankind will still have hope.  \n  \n&gt;Prometheus was punished as well. He was sentenced by Zeus to spend eternity chained to a mountain where each day an eagle will devour his liver from his body. Prometheus was an immortal, so each night his liver regrew and his wound healed, only so that it may be ripped from his body the next day.\n\nI find a number of different striking similarities between this Greek myth and the Hebrew story of Adam and Eve.  Epimetheus appears to be analogous to Adam, and Pandora seems analogous to Eve.  Just as Epimetheus is tasked with giving attributes to all the animals, Adam is tasked with giving all the animals their names.  Epimetheus and Pandora are described as lacking wisdom, just as Adam and Eve are implied to have been relatively unintelligent before they ate of the tree of knowledge.  In both stories, man was disadvantaged by an oversight: in the Greek story, all helpful attributes had been exhausted upon the animals so that none were left for man; while in the Hebrew story, no suitable partner was found among the animals for the man.  In both stories, the man was created from clay, and in both stories the woman was created after the man and for the purpose of being his gift or partner.  The gods put before Pandora an object that she is forbidden from investigating (i.e. the box), while God puts before Adam and Eve an object they are forbidden from investigating (i.e. the fruit of knowledge).  Pandora's curiosity leads her to open the forbidden box, just as Eve's curiosity leads her to eat of the forbidden fruit --  in both cases, the woman is the culprit.  In both stories, mankind is inflicted with a curse as a result of their pursuit of knowledge and civilization.  In both cases, the gods actively oppose mankind's pursuit of knowledge and civilization.  \n\nFurthermore, it is my belief that the Hebrew analog to Prometheus is the serpent.  Contrary to the traditional interpretation of the serpent as a villain, I understand the serpent in the Hebrew story to actually be the hero, much like Prometheus, as he is the character who is described as being wise himself and so also wishes mankind to be bestowed with wisdom as well.  And much like Prometheus is eternally punished by the gods for his heroic advocacy of mankind, the serpent is also permanently punished by God for leading Adam and Eve to eat of the fruit of knowledge (i.e. to forever crawl upon his belly, to eat of the dust, and to be in enmity with mankind). \n\nWhat is the historical reason for these similarities?  What is the cause of such strikingly similar themes in the stories of two very different civilizations?",
