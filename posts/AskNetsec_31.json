She of course started panicking and was wondering if her webcam got hacked. She had tape over it, but the microphone seemed to still be picking up. My suspicion for this is that all movement stopped as *soon* as I said \"Yeah, but if they hacked the mic then they'd know we're on to them and they would've stopped by now.\"\n\nI've already got the laptop sitting here and plan on checking on it tomorrow morning with a Live Linux USB. I told her to go ahead and change all her passwords as I assumed anyone who had access to mouse control and mic input would certainly have a keylogger active. I also had her make sure 2FA was enabled on everything. I'm curious what steps to take next. \n\nI plan on backing up her documents and wiping the drive, dual booting Windows for necessary applications and Linux for other use.

I found a Python implementation of the Slowloris attack, which I ran and analyzed. I found a common theme of the attack is the partial GET headers always contained the text 'X-a:' followed by four random digits. I wrote the following rule utilizing regular expressions (I believed this would cut down on false positives):\n\nalert tcp any any -&gt; any 80 (msg:\"Possible Slowloris Attack Detected\"; \\ flow:to_server,established; pcre:\"/X-a|3a| \\d{4}../\"; sid:10000005;)\n\nwhich detects the attack successfully with minimal false positives.\n\nMy question is how I could improve upon the rule, or even if there is a better rule altogether. I understand it's not the best method of detecting the attack, as the 'X-a' in the Python script could easily be changed to something altogether (I think).\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

I mean if the hardware is already flawed from the get-go isn’t it in a way an already losing battle?\n\nI guess in addition to those questions; then from an enthusiasts point of view; is it better to buy older hardware that already has been patched multiple times and may in some way offer some resilience to new exploits? Or is it better to continually update hardware to try and stay ahead of potential exploits?\n\n\nThanks",

        "text": "So my question has two parts, firstly i would like to ask for your opinion on what is the best way to keep your computer security at a level that you would most likely never get an infection unless you are individually targeted. \n\nTo avoid that kind of infection currently i am using the windows antivirus + UAC (and standar user account) + malwarebytes free (on demand) + hitmanpro (on demand) + adblocker + updating everything that touches the internet + tinywall with whitelisting + common sense.\n\nAnything that i download (unless from a very reputable source) i scan with the AV, Malwarebytes and hitman pro. I also scan the system with hitman pro and Malwarebytes and check it with Comodo KillSwitch from time to time.\n\nI am hoping that if anything slips through the cracks, it will at least not be able to connect anywhere due to the whitelisting approach of the firewall (unless it piggybacks on some trusted application). My important data are being backed up regularly so having my system destroyed by a virus is not a big issue to me, what i am really worried about is having my personal data stolen. \n\nI downloaded kaspersky Internet security trial and noticed the Trusted appications mode module, which from my understanding is a whitelisting mode for applications. This seems like a good idea to harden my system but i can't justify buying the product just for this feature and from what i have come to realize antivirus programs are really not that useful anymore, i mean it is good to have the windows antivirus running since it's free and it's there, just in case you download some old malware (i torrent a lot) but no antivirus can really protect me from new threats effectively and in some cases it actually decreases the security of the system. I played a little bit with RATs in the past (for science) and even with my limited knowledge i could create malware that could access everything in a system, spy through the computer's camera and watch the user's desktop in real time. And all i had to do to bypass any kind of antivirus was to encrypt the malware (perfect scores on Virustotal). That showed to me how useless and a placebo effect antivirus software really is today.\n\nWith that in mind, what do you think i could do differently to secure my system apart from going completely offline? \n\nSecond part of my question is, if you have a very carefully designed malware that doesn't tick the obvious boxes that hint to an infection, how can you quickly find out that you have been infected and start to take action before the malware has a chance to steal data? Is there some application that can run in the background and give me popups for when any application starts running every time i use my computer (don't say task manager :) )? I am thinking of searching for some type of application whitelisting app (kinda like what Kaspersky TAM does) which in combination with the whitelisting approach of the firewall should give me enough time to realize i have been infected. I could also add something like glasswire to the mix and get notification when a new app tries to access the internet. That way i could theoretically stop every threat that doesn't piggyback on other trusted processes (which i do not think i can do anything more than i am already doing to stop). What do you think?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8a5mhu/is_the_job_recruiting_security_industry_still_in/",
        "text": "So to preface this, I have 2 years professional experience in the infosec world. Went to a Security Engineer position right out of college. I planned on staying here for 5 years, but after some frustrating work conditions I decided to try to switch jobs. I've encountered a lot of scenarios that make me feel like this industry is still immature, in terms of how it recruits.\n\n1. \"Previous Experience\". While it is true that the experience requirements may just be what they want, I still find an enormous amount of jobs that list themselves as entry level, yet want 3-5 years experience in SW engineering, network engineering, sys admin, etc. On top of 2-4 years with various security tools. I've talked to people in those positions. Worked with a few. The chances that they are being exposed to security professionally is low. Most of the security exposure will happen on their own time as extra curricular activities outside of work. Even then, I've had recruiters tell me they are explicitly looking for someone with experience with \"X, Y, and Z\" security tools and aren't considering candidates who don't have them. Except there's very few positions out there willing to accept someone with no experience in said tools, so experienced professionals are being generated at a very low rate. \n\n2. Pay. The pay sucks at sooo many places. Despite them wanting you to have all this previous experience, you bet your butt they want to pay you the same salary as an entry level software engineer or network engineer. I had a position that was looking to pay someone in the lower 50k/yr for application security in LA. They would only considered candidates with a minimum of 2 years experience in embedded systems. I had a security analyst position for a big enterprise wanting to pay 50-55k/yr in Denver with 2 years previous IT experience. Had a company in the middle of Seattle looking for 5+ years in the information security industry wanting to hiring a security engineer (with netsec and appsec activities) for mid 90k. I encountered so many scenarios where companies basically didn't want to pay for previous experience, but wanted you to have it. Why even bother switching out of those intial positiosn when you're paying the same salary or less...despite more responsibilities. I've seen entry appsec positions with almost a copy to copy paste of a entry software engineer position at the same company, just with security responsibitiles added on...similar pay. \n\n3. Nobody wants to be the training company. Companies just don't seem to want the newbie. Schools don't seem to be teaching \"how\" to use tools. I routinely talk to students who are learning the concepts and booksmarts of information security, but now being teached how to use tools. For example, they know what a SIEM or vuln scanner is, but don't know how to use one. This doesn't help when companies start asking them specific how questions. \n\n4. If you don't want to live in Texas, NOVA, or NYC; you're going to have trouble. What little \"true\" entry level jobs without horrible pay there are, they are in those 3 areas. Sure the west coast has a bunch of \"tech\" hubs, but true entry level jobs are few and far between. They are also feircly competitive with a ton of applicants. \n\n5. Huge location biased. If you don't live within a reasonable location of a job you're applying to for entry level, it is very hard to get the offer. Most of these locations have quite a few local candidates also applying. Relocation benefits are rare. Companies don't seem to want to do relocation anymore. I didn't start getting responses till I said \"I will pay for my own relocation and interviews\" in every place I could when applying to distant locations. \n\n6. Bad work conditions. So you finally find that job that doesn't have these frustrating aspects mentioned above...well you soon find out why. They want you to travel 4/5 days a week. Or they want you to work night shift. Companies know that the conditions suck, so they set the bar really low. Just what I want to do. Move to LA and sleep the entire day so I can work a night shift and not have a social life. \n\n7. People are frustrating. People in general seem to not care about security. I've been in line of a grocery store and heard a senior network engineer (he was sure to let everyone know) how annoying and unneeded security is. I have had a level 5 (max you can get at the company) system administrator tell me to not worry about securing a system because vulnerabiltiies come out so fast that it will just be vulnerable the next day, so what's the point. Managers similar stories. You have to have a very specific work environment in terms of personnel to actually get things done in info sec. And most of the time it needs to be enforced by upper management who aren't afraid to lay down the law if people ignore it. \n\n8. HR doesn't seem to know how to recruit for the position. Recruitors telling me they mainly want people who have worked with a specific standard of compliance set, such as PCI. If you haven't, they don't consider you. Even if you have experience working with a different standard. Similar thing with tools. Sure you have worked with Tenable, but we're mainly looking for those experience in Splunk. I suspect is from a lack of knowledge about the industry. Not realizing that things are similar or there are skillsets that benefit each other from working in the respective areas. \n\nIt basically seems like you have to be super passionate about this industry. I am and I enjoy it, but I'm starting to wondering if it is even worth it right now. It seems to be higher stress, companies want you to sacrifice so much of your social lives with night shifts/travel requirements, pay doesn't seem to be that much better. I guess this turned more into a rant than anything, it has just been a frustrating 6 months. ",

        "text": "Does anyone know of resources describing things developers do that should be red flags for sysadmins/devops/$current_buzzword people?  \n\nMost everything I've found seems targeted toward people working in security or development roles.  While the stuff written for security people is fine for me I haven't found anything that's written at a level where it would take less worth to be modified and handed to someone who does not natively speak English than it would to write from scratch.\n\nBackground info:\n\nI'm on an ops team that acts as middle men for a lot of stuff in the organization.  We are responsible for a bunch of hosts that run apps developed by app teams.   Most of the team doesn't have a background in security nor do the dev teams we work with.  Some of the systems we deal with are subject to PCI.  We're kind of in a precarious position right now because literally nobody on this team has been here more than 2y and for most of the team this is their first real tech job so they don't have experience to fall back on.  Cultural differences and time zones do not improve the situation.  \n\nThe organization is placing more emphasis on security and reliability.  This makes life harder for the devs who think that code only needs to be written well enough so you to fleece the next round of investors.  We've had a couple examples recently of people being told no and then resubmitting requests/tickets with the hope that different team members will approve.  \n\nWe're not talking complex stuff here, just basic stupidity like app teams wanting to generate their own production credentials or have their app connect to an AWS account or network storage thing not managed by an ops team.\n\nMy team doesn't really have an official responsibility for security so it won't be us that takes the blame at the end of the day but we have an implicit responsibility because we're in a position where we can prevent people from initially deploying stuff that is fundamentally flawed and we obviously have a vested interest in the company not producing a crap product.\n\nTl;DR I'm looking to resources that can help me write a basic list of \"if the ticket says do X then this should be a red-flag\"\n\n",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nNot long ago, I booked a hotel with a third-party website, much like Hotels.com or Priceline. The confirmation link they gave me is unauthenticated and can be easily enumerated to scrape the following information for thousands of individuals:\n\n* Full name\n* Email address\n* Phone number\n* **Home address**\n* Last 4 digits of credit card number\n* Credit card expiration date\n* Amount charged\n* Hotel of reservation\n* **Dates of reservation**\n* Date of booking\n\nEven with just the home address and reservation dates made available, someone could have their home broken into while they are away.\n\nTo top all of that off, there's a nice cancellation button at the bottom that anyone can click to cancel their reservation without a refund. (I haven't tried to click it because it can do actual damage to someone, but I think it's safe to assume that it works.) And by the way, there's a REST API to grab all of this data in nicely formatted JSON.\n\nI notified them via the email address that they provided on their website, but it's been over a month without a response and there is no evidence that they have been working on a fix. I don't want to take this public because it can wreak havoc on anyone who has ever booked with them, and possibly worse for those who have yet to check in to their reservation.\n\nWhat do I do about this? They're not an \"A-list\" booking site like you might see on a TV commercial, but they're big enough to appear near the top of a search engine if you query for hotels (that's how I found them, anyway).",
