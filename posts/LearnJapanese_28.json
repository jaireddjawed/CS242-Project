I absolutely love the process of learning the kanas, and the complex world of kanji is so intriguing to me. I love drawing, so this is another factor when learning kanji, as it is such an elegant writing style with intricate lines and forms. Anyway.\n\nI have seriously thought about going to Yamasa Institute for a year or two in Japan. I have researched it closely, and it seems to be a perfect place for what and how I want to learn. The tuition is actually surprisingly cheap, with accommodation included, which is very nice. I'd easily be able to take a loan from the system we have here in Norway regarding loans to support the entire thing.\n\nI really wanted to do that. It's my dream to be able to live in Japan, their culture is so fascinating to me.\n\nBut then my dreams were crushed... because I realized two things.\n\n1. Student visa. It costs around 1,5 Million JPY. Even with the fact that I'm working now, that kind of money just makes the whole thing a real struggle, and it sucks.\n2. Getting some kind of job afterwards with no bachelor yet. I don't have a bachelor yet, and I've heard everywhere that it is essential to have one if you were to work in Japan.\n\nI kept reading all these things about people saying it is a worthless dream to go to a language school because you find another language so interesting, and really want to learn all about it. Because, at the end of the day, after you are done with the language school, you're without a bachelor and you have no other skills to show to be employed in Japan. The natives are already way better at speaking than you even after you finish the school and they HAVE skills to apply in different jobs there.\n\nIt's just sad. I guess this is a bit of a rant, but I'm mostly wondering about this;\n\nIs there anything else at all I can do at this point, other than just kneeling down and giving up? Every day, I keep learning japanese, listen to various media completely in japanese and I want to completely immerse myself in it. This is why a language school IN Japan is interesting to me, not one in Norway, where I honestly would be too exposed to my own language all day.\n\nHas anyone done something different to achieve something similar to what I hope to do? Or is it useless?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zp3vcy/a_few_weird_observations_on_Âè£_animal_radical/",
        "text": "Bit of an unusal post here, hear me out. \n\nI've spent this year cramming kanji meanings at an extreme pace; even if I cannot pronounce them I'd like to learn as many meanings as possible, so that I can intuit my way around new compounds and signage without actually 'saying' it in my head. This is especially important to me as the number of readings some kanji have or the obscure cases you'll run into them seems far more high-level than I'm at right now, and I'd rather enjoy the fun of being able to understand even if my verbal fluency lags severely behind.\n\nThat brings me to a very unusual question I've stumbled into by chance. By sticking together radicals, kanji form meaning that are occasionally very literal. Âè£ + Áä¨ makes Âê†, or 'to bark', or „Åª„Åà. This can conjugate to Âê†„Åà„Çã to become the act of barking, or poetically things that 'bark' their sound (maybe like a chainsaw?). Âè£ + È≥• forms È≥¥ 'cry' or 'ring', and conjugates to È≥¥„Åè which represents more shrill sounding noises, and could be used for the beeps of a watch alarm etc. (more like tweeting!). Recently, I discovered Âè£ + Áå´ form Âñµ which means to meow...and from there I've started finding more questions.\n\nSo, first of all Âñµ does not have a reading on Google Translate nor Jisho, but translating it from Chinese to Japanese results in „Éã„É£„Éº. The Chinese reading is MiƒÅo. Putting „ÅÜ sounds on it out of curiousity (like with È≥¥„Åè or Âê†„Åà„Çã) results in the translations such as \"sigh\" or \"cry\".\n\nTherein lies my first question. How would a Japanese speaker refer to the kanji Âñµ, verbally? Is its reading „Å´„ÇÉ„ÅÇ or is it „Åø„ÅÇ„Åä? Hypothetically if I were to \"force\" meowing into a -u verb in the same way you can with barking and tweeting, how would I do that‚Äîlike which underlying rules dictate which -u form it takes (if it is even possible to conjugate in that way)?\n\nBut I found myself asking if there's any other animal radicals you can put with Âè£ to get a \"sound\" kanji. That's when I found Âè£ + È¶¨ = Âóé. Google translate just gives \"Ugh\" as a translation (I like to think it gave up trying) and offers no readings. 10ten and Jisho tell me it's a \"Final interrogative particle\" and translating from Chinese-to-Japanese tells me it functions as the same as if the sentence were structured \"„Åù„Çå„ÅØ...„Åß„Åô„Åã?\" \n\nHowever, said Jisho page is a lot less comprehensible than usual. It gives the readings Kun: „ÅÆ„ÅÆ„Åó.„Çã and On: „Éê, but I can't get Âóé to result from either reading using my input method (on win/android, at least). Also where did Google get that \"ugh\" translation from?\n\nAnyway the only real conclusion I've drawn so far is that I should probably learn some more dictionary services than the ones I've mentioned hereÂóé?\n\n^Hey also weird fun-fact I discovered in the process of this post, but google translates \"„Å∞\" on its own to the typo \"palce\".",

When katakana does turn up it trips me up, my reading speed drops from the speed of speaking to a character every 5 seconds and the rest of the sentence isn't comprehended due to my thinking method changing from natural recognition to mnemonics and such. \n\nExposure and reading has been the fastest way for me to improve my hiragana, in comparison to drills like flash cards and writing drills .

My pronunciation sucks (accent is still there is what I mean by the way), and getting to native level, well, it's obviously gonna take forever. \n\nTherefore, I decided to just get through genki 1 and 2 and learn mainly from music, but I cant' even get through genki 1 because of how many particles and how they work.\n\nI'm only 14 by the way, and I'm planning on being an utaite in japan, but my pronunciation needs improvement and I want my content to be in japanese (I want to upload on niconico first).\n\nI understand that there are a lot of obstacles since it's a hard language, but I don't know how to make it easier for my tiny little brain (there probably isn't a way though).\n\nThe only least painful thing is kanji, because I have photographic memory.\n\nAlso my japanese children's grammar books help a lot as well, and aren't painful.\n\nDoes anybody know what I should do now? It's absolutely impossible for me to learn the language at this point. I can't get through it, I'm just horrible at learning languages in general, and I've tried several times to learn japanese, but I always give up too soon.\n\nPlease let me know what I should do, I really need help.",

Putting myself not at the beginner level but close to intermediate would be my guess for application purposes.\n\nHas anyone done one of these through a college or other program and can recommend any?

        "text": "First, let me put some context here:\n\nLiving in japan, I decided to watch Suzume no Tojimari... of course, it's completely in Japanese, and I didn't go to a closed-captioned showing.  Now, I am actively studying- currently working through Tobira, so I'm in the Intermediate stage.  All this to say, I understood a TON of the movie... I'm going to estimate between 65\\~70% of it.  And, there's a VERY specific reason why, IMO.\n\nMost of the movie has our characters in very normal situations, interacting with people like you might do on a daily basis-despite what the movie is ultimately about.  The stuff that went by me was when the details about the very specific situation of the movie were discussed... but again, most of the movie uses words and phrases that you're likely to encounter during daily life in japan.  Or in other words, it's got a HUGE Slice of Life element to it.\n\nSo why do i talk about this being a trap?  While certainly not all, the majority of people who want to learn Japanese are fans of anime and manga... and I would guess it's more shounen/shoujo/seinen/josei manga, to use those categories.  These categories, ESPECIALLY shounen,  use words more specific to fights and battles, and extremely casual, if not \"rude\" Japanese- the kind you won't find in a textbook.  Or to put it another way:  the manga you find exciting... is NOT beginner-friendly.\n\nIt kinda sucks, but until you're in the N3/N2 ability level, chances are anything beyond slice-of-life is going to have words, phrases and grammar points that you won't understand without burying yourself in a dictionary... and burying yourself in a dictionary means less time reading manga/watching anime.  S for those starting out/of a lower level, accept that you're going to have to start with slice-of-life stuff if you want to comprehend the majority of the story.",

Of course, some of my key goals for this exchange is to make Japanese friends and improve my fluency in the language.\n\nSo background: I've never studied Japanese formally before. It's always been a casual side hobby. I would say reading is my strongest, followed by my listening and speaking. My speaking is disproportionately strong compared to my reading and listening. My listening comprehension is also surprisingly strong and I can understand a lot of daily conversation (and therefore get by).\n\nBut, since I never formally studied the language, my grasp of the grammar and language conventions is minimal. I can express basic ideas but likely with tons of weird grammar mistakes. How I went about learning the language was through a lot of immersion - after I learnt hiragana I went into consuming native material and slowly picked up things from there.\n\nI want to be able to improve my Japanese so that when I'm over there I can:\n- Talk to people easily and make friends.\n- Not stuff up keigo in front of people I need to use keigo with.\n- Handle more formal business situations by myself. \n\nI am also thinking of enrolling in some sort of language school, especially for the first month or so while I don't have uni classes, so that I can get things polished up. Any recommendations in the Tokyo area? I am so terrified of mixing up keigo and tameguchi since most of my conversation practice here is with people my own age in casual settings.\n\nAnd let me know if there's any further study I can do myself to polish up some of my Japanese as well before I get there!",

However, I've seen clips, and I can already tell it's a very different Japanese than I study.  Similar to how Shakespearean English is pretty different from Modern English.\n\nNow, of course, a lot of my lack of comprehension is probably because even my conversational Japanese is still at a very basic level.  So my question is: assuming a decent level of competency in conversational modern Japanese, can one piece together older-style Japanese of that type?  Thanks!",

It's still currently under development (11/15 lessons done), but I estimate it'll be fully completed by sometime early next year.\n\nAdditionally, this project, much like its predecessor, is open source, so you can [view the code on GitHub](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/tobira-study-resources) as well as contribute improvements, fixes, etc. It can also be [downloaded and used offline](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/tobira-study-resources/download/) for when you may not have access to the internet.\n\nI hope that this website will be of use to others in their studies!",

There are literally dozens of creative mnemonics that makes memorizing kanji a bliss.\n\nHopefully WK implements a resource like Koohii, because as a paid resource, it's no more than a glorified SRS system with different radicals.\n\nEdit: Being a bit more objective, WK at least tries to help you memorize the readings, and sometimes it works.",
