        "text": "Hi all, thank you in advance for helping me. My goal is to use linear programming to optimize the Golden State Warriors' lineup by each quarter (Q1, halftime, Q3, and Q4). For instance, knowing that Curry's average minutes per game, how can I maximize his time throughout all 4 quarters while satisfying all contraints (e.g. maximum number of minutes a player can play, maximum of 5 players on the court and they all need to play a different position and so on).  I've gathered the GSW players' stats (minutes played per game, points per game, and etc.) using basketball-reference.com. My plan for the next step is to find a way to assign a score (1-100) for each player. This way, it'll be much easier to execute my LP. I'm just not sure how. Since players all play a different position and some players play multiple, it'll definitely be an unfair advantage to compare a point guard and a center. My thought process is to compare a point guard on the GSW team with the \"greatest centers of all time\" (https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/greatest-centers-of-all-time). This way, I can see where the center from GSW falls. What are your thoughts?   Please keep in mind that this is a very naive and broad project. I wont be to take in unforeseen contingencies such as injuries, trades and so forth.",

I've got a problem that I'm a bit stuck on: can we safely examine correlations between properties of network nodes?\n\nBackground: My research is on a graph theoretic approach to brain networks. Essentially, we have 233 well-defined regions of interest, we get their fMRI BOLD time series, and define our graph based on pairwise Pearson correlations between the time series of these 233 nodes. After we binarize based on something like the top 20% of strongest connections, we have an undirected binary graph to work with.\n\nFor each node, we further calculate two quantitative properties, and we're interested in seeing how well these properties correspond to each other. We'd like to simply take the correlations between these two 233-element vectors, but were not sure if that's valid, since the nodes of the network are definitionally not independent observations, and the properties are defined with respect to the nodes &amp; edges.\n\nIs this a real issue? And if so, how can I examine quantitatively the correspondence between these two properties?",

        "text": "I am currently trying to perform regression analysis to understand what affects Tenure of an employee. Particularly, I noticed that we gave an across-the-board pay raise on 8/4/2017 (the \"cutoff\").  I want to control for this event by distinguishing each employee as a \"Pre\" or \"Post\" employee.  Obviously, the problem is overlap.  Some employees started 1 month before the cutoff and stayed for 5 months after the cutoff.  Some employees started 2 years before the cutoff and never made it past the cutoff.  Some employees have spent basically 50-50 of their time before and after the cutoff.\n\nLet's say Employee 1 has records for:\n\n1/1/2016 - 10/31/2016\n10/31/2016 - 2/14/2017\n2/14/2017 - 4/1/2017\n4/1/2017 - 8/1/2017\n8/1/2017 - 10/1/2017\n10/1/2017 - 2/1/2018\n\nNormally, I use regression analysis for future predictive purposes, hence I only want to use a priori inputs to predict an a posteriori output. But here, this is more of a descriptive analysis, so I am unsure how much a posteriori input I am allowed to use.\n\nSo, clearly in this example, for PRE-cutoff I definitely want to include 2/14/2017 - 4/1/2017, and for POST-cutoff I want to include 8/1/2017 - 10/1/2017\n\n...BUT:\n\n1) Do I include all the employee's records, even if they fall entirely outside of the appropriate time bound? (e.g. 1/1/2016 - 10/31/2016) This will mean that some covariates are NULL due to lack of data prior to 2017.\n\n2) Do I truncate the end-points that fall outside of my bounds? (e.g. convert 10/31/2016 - 2/14/2017 to 1/1/2017 - 2/14/2017) This will result in a new calculation of Tenure for that record.\n\n3) Assuming my target is Tenure (in months), how should I calculate this? That is, assume an employee started 4/1/2017, so they were active for only 1 month within the PRE-cutoff period, but most of their tenure is in the POST-cutoff period. What should I do here?\n\n4) Should I just calculate what % of tenure someone spent in each respective period, and only include the employee where they spent the majority of their time?  Must they spend at least 60% of their time in a particular cutoff period?  Etc.\n\n5) Finally, any other considerations that y'all may have?",

I want to know the odds of \"burning\" the same card twice in 2 games when I only burnt one card per game. \n\nBoth games I drew my \"best card\" on the only turn that it could hurt me. The first game it was the 26th card I drew out of a 30 card deck. The second game it was the 20th card I drew out of a 30 card deck. \n\n1st game: I played a card that draws 5 cards while there were only 10 cards left in my deck, I had 5 cards in my hand and the hand can only hold 10 cards. Knowing that I was drawing 5/10 remaining cards, my odds of finding the card I needed were decent. The risk was I would burn 1 card at the start of the next turn because my hand was full. Then I would have 4 remaining cards. Long story short I burnt the card I needed. \n\n2nd game: Was identical to the first game except I drew 5 cards with 15 cards left in my deck. Burning 1 and leaving 9 in my deck. I once again burnt the card I needed. \n\nConsidering I drew 25 cards and 20 cards with no success only draw it at the wrong time. I know I had a 10% chance to burn the card when I elected to draw 5 cards in the 1st game and ~6% in the second game; but what are the odds that I never drew this card in the first 45 cards (collectively) only to burn it twice? \n\nThanks and I look forward to some educational responses!

We were having a general discussion on the way we construct such a basket using a minimum variance portfolio. During the discussion someone asked why we would account for \"good variance\" as in variance in a positive direction from a risk free rate (we were using 5%) for a given year (we were using historical yearly data from the past 25 years from 3 different stocks). thus signaling better returns, saying who cares how far away from the mean it is as long as its above the risk free rate. Our professor told us about the half variance (I think that is what he called it) where you only use the variances from the years that a stock was less than the 5% risk free asset, and allow the variance to be 0 when a stock did better than the risk free asset, thus, not \"punishing\" a stock for doing better than expected when minimizing the variance. So my question to you, in theory how does this work? Is it a viable way to minimize variance to maximize profits by basically forgetting about variance in a direction that would benefit the portfolio? What are the problems that could arise from emitting variance data from years where stocks out performed? ",

        "text": "Hi All - Looking for help from anyone who has analyzed dyadic data. I'm finishing my PhD in counseling psych, and worked myself into quite a pickle with my stats analysis. Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nHere are the basics of my design: Experimental Coupleâs Intervention (repeated measures) -Unit(case): Dyads (n = 38 [76 inds]) -IV: Treatment group (3 levels) (between) -IV: pre-post (within) Covariate(? may have to toss if too complex): GQ DVâs: grateful mood (GMS), relationship satisfaction (DAS), relationship maintenance behaviors (RMB)\n\nI randomly assigned couples to the three intervention groups. Breakdown of N in the groups is: group 1 = 14 couples, grp 2 = 12 couples, and grp 3 (control) = 11 couples.\n\nHYP: the intervention will increase GMS which will then increase rel. satisfaction DAS and RMB (related DV's) Also hypothesized the intervention groups (1 &amp; 2) would have higher outcomes than the control group (group 3). Taking it one step further I hyp that grp 1 would be higher than grp 2 and 3 because of how the intervention was carried out.\n\nBecause they are couples, I believe theoretically the data must stay in a dyadic organization in order to effectively account for the interdependence. I tried to organize it so that I could use the dyad as the case (first column) and the âpartnerâ as differentiating husbands and wives.\n\nI originally planned to do a MLM within the actor-partner interdependence model but I did not achieve the full number of couples I expected Iâd need (n = 51 couples). I know its really tricky to even estimate sample size soâ¦ idk? I heard the model wouldnât even run if I didnât have enough data in the sample? Iâd planned on a 2 level model with level 1 = measures and level 2 = people (in the dyad). Anyone have really basic instructions on how to test and see if this would run or not?\n\nAnother option Iâve been exploring is a factorial MANOVA (or MANCOVA), but I am unsure how to handle the dyads in a way that is theoretically sound (not just summing or averaging). What I was thinking is that I may set up the MANOVA where IV = group, COV = GQ, and DV is four occurrences (no clue if thatâs the right term) of each assessment (1 per dyad (2) at two time points = 4). Is that even a thing? Or am I not really accounting for the dyad if I try to set it up that way?\n\nAny and all help is welcome. I'm mildly familiar with SPSS and very basically familiar with R (so may need some step by step instructions if at all possible).\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts/suggestions/help! ",

Bear with me as I try to explain this. \n\nSo I'm working on a research project to analyze and rank the most contaminated areas in the state of Georgia. I managed to make a list of all the counties in Georgia that contain 1 or more toxic sites by compiling the data found in Georgia's EPA Hazardous Site Inventory. From this, I made a Top 5 list with which I will need help. So my goal is to analyze and rank which pollutants are most commonly found in the Top 5 county list. I would like to make a Top 10 list of pollutants from this analysis. So to do that, I would have to go through each individual site for all 5 counties and make a list of pollutants. For example, Site A for Cobb County might have 12 pollutants, while Site B has only 5. So Cobb will have 17 total and then I'd move on to the next county. However each pollutant in each site is further categorized by soil or groundwater. So it can be found in soil, groundwater, or both.\n\nLink to Hazardous Site Inventory: http://epd.georgia.gov/sites/epd.georgia.gov/files/2017HSI/10145.pdf\n\nMy professor introduced me to someone in the Statistics Department who was more knowledgeable in SAS. He was able to draw out a quick sketch of what the table should probably look like. Then he further went on to say that SAS would be the perfect program to crank out this kind of table and using proc freq is the way to go. He said that SAS has the ability to create both of these tables in the sketch. I'm just confused on what the code should be for both of them. I know proc.freq is used for the second one but I think it would need some tweaking that I'm not familiar with. For the code to make the first table to include all the variables, I have no clue on what the code would be.\n\nLink to table sketch: https://i.imgur.com/buHuqvi.jpg\n\nIndependent Variables = Site, County\nDependent Variables = Pollutant. Soil and Groundwater are dependent on Pollutant (?)\n\nEdit: Thought it would be more clear to see, but Pol = Pollutant. S and W means Soil and Water (Groundwater), respectively. For S and W, he used 0 and 1 to indicate whether the pollutant was found in soil or groundwater, just to be clear. Kinda like how 0 and 1 is used to indicate Gender.\n\nSorry if this sounds all over the place. I'm just really confused on how to get started on this. Any help would be REALLY appreciated.",

Obtain the lower and upper bounds of *aÌ* (by taking the mean of the lowest *kmin* values of *x* and the highest *kmin* values of *x*, respectively).\n 2. Define some function *f(aÌ)* which, taking *aÌ* as a guess, calculates the best *Îµ* and returns *â(Îµi)*.\n 3. Find the maximum of *f* over the bounds found in step 1. If max(*f*) &lt; *kmin*, then we know that *x* does not fit the original assumptions and is therefore an invalid dataset.\n\nI've been stuck trying to come up with *f*.\n\n#####Conclusion#####\nFor the record, I am completely aware of the limited applicability of this problem (because you're effectively forcing a dataset to conform to your preconceptions), but the problem exists in a situation where the reliability of the preconceptions is infinitely higher than the reliability of the data (because of the known possibility of the presence of some subversive subset *b* in *x*).\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n**Edit:** Reformatted for easier reading\n\n**Edit 2:** Clarified goal.",

I understand that this test compares two SSR values (sum of squared residuals) and decides, also based on the number of parameters of the models, which one it is more reasonable to accept. In practice, if I understand correctly, I would need to first fit `M0` (find the parameters of `M0` which correspond best to the data) : `M0(a0)`, fit `M1`: `M1(a1, b1, c1)`, and compare the SSRs, which would tell me which of `M0(a0)` or `M1(a1, b1, c1)` is the most probable. But does it really answer my question? I have just compared two \"champions\" (`M0(a0)` is a specific instance of `M0`, and `M1(a1, b1, c1)` is a specific instance of `M1` as well), which does not tell me whether `M0` or `M1` is more reasonable, does it? If the F-test tells me to prefer `M0(a0)`, I just know that the *best* `M0` is more probable than the *best* `M1`, but I am not sure how it should follow that `M0` is more probable than `M1` *in general*.\n\nI would really appreciate if you could direct me to resources to understand this!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/886wwt/narrowing_down_the_number_of_tests_of_association/",
        "text": "I want to run a large number of tests of statistical association between a few categories (think Fisher's exact test). However, because I am running a very large number of tests, my multiple testing correction (Bonferroni) ends up quite strict, and so if possible, I would like to reduce the effective number of tests I am running.\n\nWould it be statistically inappropriate to test only combinations of observations that, prior to accounting for multiple testing, are significant?\n\nSay I have 100 observations, and they break down into a contingency table that looks like the following:\n\n    50    0\n    0    50\n\nA table like this quite obviously shows a significant association, prior to multiple test correction. Whether the p-value produced by a contingency table such as this one remains significant after multiple testing correction clearly depends on the number of tests run. However, consider the following table:\n\n    25    25\n    25    25\n\nThis one is obviously not significant, regardless of multiple testing correction or not.\n\nSo what about something like this?\n\n    32    18\n    23    27\n\nThe two-tailed Fisher's exact p-value for this one equal ~0.1, so not significant prior to multiple testing correction either.\n\nMy question is, is it inappropriate to exclude tests such as the one (immediately) above from counting as a test in multiple testing correction? The logic being that it has no chance in the first place of producing a significant value, and so there it is impossible for it to be significant after multiple testing correction.\n\nAn issue such as I describe above seems to be related to the limitations of certain statistical tests, extrapolating to regression and related methods. If a regression I run to test for association cannot possibly produce a significant value given the \"counts\" of the data, then is it at all appropriate to run such a test in the first place with the given method? My first thought is that no, it is not appropriate, and that a method without such a limitation should be chosen in order to test those cases.\n\nBut something about my logic seems well...wrong, as well. I really don't know if this would be an appropriate way to narrow down the number of tests performed, or whether it is a form of \"hacking\" to increase the chances of finding significant results, and is a big no-no in statistical analysis.\n\n",

I can make the program run separate (phylogenetic-controlled) regressions for males and females that will output slopes and intercepts with their respective standard errors. \n\nDo I need to independently test the slopes and intercepts from these outputs (t tests for each male vs female slope and intercept), and if so how do I do that?

I'm no mathematician, so my apologies if I'm explaining this poorly.\n\n---\n\nTo start, we assumed and agreed that there are 3 levels of a relationship two variables can have (well, 4 if you count absolutely no relationship whatsoever, even a coincidental one)\n\n(1) causation, where there's clear and direct cause. Example: the number of hours per day I sleep directly correlates with the number of hours per day in which I'm awake.\n\n(2) indirect correlation, in which there isn't direct causation but there is some common link or systemic factor(s). Example: areas with higher poverty rates tend to have higher crime rates.\n\n(3) spurious correlations or coincidence, in which two variables happen to track each other but there is neither causation nor an underlying similar root. This is perhaps best exemplified by the site [SpuriousCorrelations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) which, for example, shows that US spending on science &amp; technology correlates with suicides by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation with an *r* of 0.99789.\n\n**Person A** was stating that the definition of a correlation is simply that when one variable increases (or decreases), so does another variable. So person A declared that all 3 of these examples showed a correlation between two variables.\n\nIn contrast, **Person B** was stating that data that cannot lead you to accurately predict future outcomes by definition cannot constitute a correlation. In other words, a correlation can only exist if there is some actual real-world relationship between the two variables whether it be indirect or direct (aka, causal). And as such, he would say that the above scenarios #1 and #2 show a correlation but #3 does not.\n\n---\n\nThoughts?",
