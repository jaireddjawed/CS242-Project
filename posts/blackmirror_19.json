And more and more law enforcement agencies are using them for surveillance. Experiments have begun to test their proficiency at crowd control\n\nBoston Dynamics has produced *dogs* to work in *warehouses*\n\nIt would be nothing to put small weapons on the drones- maybe flechettes\n\nAnd arming the dogs would be as easy as adding attachments to a vacuum cleaner\n\nMy prediction is that the military will note the effectiveness of both and weaponize them (if they haven't already). At first they would have to be remotely monitored and controlled. But, with existing face and target recognition software, autonomy is just an interface away. \n\nThen we just wait for the military to screw up, a hacker to break into the control system, or terrorists to buy a few on the black market.\n\nPig fucking is already a thing however Arkangel, social media determining social status, cookies and convicted murderer theme parks are a ways off.\n\nBut you could wake up tomorrow and hear about how rogue dogs and/or \"ADIs\" were killing people\n\nAnd that is scary \n\n",

The way they casually sentence Joe's cookie to 4.320.000 years of listening to fucking I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday in a tiny cabin, unable to escape with nothing to do and inability to even sleep is totally fucking disturbing and pure evil. Rolo Haynes comes in close second but at least this piece of shit got what he deserved. For some reason I find both these detectives even more depraved and despicable individuals.\n\nThat episode fucked me up the most by far.\n\nSo what about you?",

I guess im just confused here on that whole part, could anyone explain how they switch eras or if San Junipero itself has like \"Theme Weeks\" or whatever where sometimes its aesthetic is from different time periods, but if thats the case then why would Wes tell her to look in a different era for Kelly. Can you only choose one \"era\" when you log in for your 5 hours, and that San Junipero exists seperately from the other eras \\(this would have serious implications, how do you choose after your true death?\\)? Can anyone help me, I know its overall a detail not that important to the story, but i feel like i'm missing something?",

        "text": "While on vacation in Denver, Colorado last week, my GF and I had just finished a 2.5mi hike at 13,000+ ft on Seven Falls trail. Later that evening our friends, who’s home we were staying, decided to stream a random episode of ‘Black Mirror’ in the hopes that I would appreciate the creative content.  We were physically and mentally exhausted by that point, and the idea of ‘Netflix &amp; Chillin’ so seemed like a relaxing ordeal.\n\nI have to admit, I knew virtually nothing about this series other than seeing the advertisements on Netflix flip across my UI interface; often while I was in search of other shows.  So I had no idea of what to expect.  Those of you reading this comment thus far should undoubtedly know the particular episode I’m referring to... [but no spoilers]\n\nAs the episode came to its conclusion, the audience is left with a very clear message.  A message so powerful that it pierced right through my 33 year old stubborn heart.  A message that whisked me 2 decades into my past - a past that Im often uninterested in dealing with... my Mom.  \n\nI shall spare the details, for they are too deeply personal. Nevertheless, as those feelings/emotions flooded back into my memory, I immediately snapped back to reality and noticed I’m LITERALLY SHEDDING TEARS...  LEGIT TEARS. I haven’t cried because of a film in several years - besides the death scene in [Malcolm X](https://youtu.be/hM3mW5HnRZ4) , the grave site scene in the [Forrest Gump](https://youtu.be/nFvASiMTDz0) , and the breakdown scene in [Good Will Hunting](https://youtu.be/UYa6gbDcx18) .  I was left stunned.  Pondering about my mother and questioning my decisions.  \n\nAm I a good/bad son? \nIs she a good Mother? \n\nI went to sleep that night with these questions on a constant loop.  The next morning on my 33rd Birthday, while on the toilet [no, I’m totally not joking 🤷🏾‍♂️] my mobile phone began to vibrate.  As I gazed at the caller, my memory immediately flips back to the scene from Black Mirror...  I stared at the ‘incoming call’ screen for several seconds as I questioned the spiritual connection between the episodes message, it’s relation to me personally, and the real-world ‘playtest’ scenario transpiring before me - albeit on the toilet 😅.   Nevertheless, as I gazed at my vibrating phone with my mothers full name flashing on-screen all I could do was... drop my head, inhale deeply, exhale slowly, then...\n\n[Grabs phone, taps ‘Accept’]\n\nMommy: Happy Birthday, to you... \n                   Happy Birthday, to you...\n\nThank you, Black Mirror. From the bottom of my stubborn heart... thank you 🙏🏾 \n#TrueStory",

The only reason this was a happy episode is because the writers decided to be nice and show the 1 in roughly 1000 times that the dating app we see isn't an existential nightmare. \n\nEven if you decide to use the app on someone who you're fairly compatible with, but ultimately wouldnt end up with, you're sending 1000 sentient copies of yourself through the ringer to arrive at the conclusion that the real you doesnt really like them. Remember, the app doesnt put the two people together in a particular setting that is designed to test the boundaries of their compatibility, it generates thousands of versions of them for the app to play with.\n\nThese test subjects are essentially slaves, and the metric used to determine what constitutes a successful trial is completely arbitrary and, I'd argue, not the best indicator of long term viability. Looking at the particular situation they're placed in, one could argue that the emotions theyre feeling in that particular moment arent indicative of how theyd feel about rebelling in another month or year. Or even that an ideal partner wouldn't want her to possibly commit suicide just for the possibility of being with her. \n\nBasically, if you're using this app, you're trusting a completely unknown entity to put potentially infinite versions of you into good places. You dont know their philosophy in life, what they value or how they perceive a happy and healthy relationship. Yet they're the ones building the track and the hurdles for you to run through, over and over and over again",

After all, black mirror has an episode with first androids that aren’t as developed as the androids in DBH. I don’t remember the name of the episode, it was the one where the one who dies comes back as a software in an android. \nApart from that, I saw some parallels to the series. \n\nI think it would be great if they would make an episode or a season based on androids with the actors of the game, because I really don’t want this to be the last time we see Connor, Kara and Markus, I really got attached to them (especially Connor, lol)\n\n",

But the final one where he was in the original test room the whole time? That seemed pointless and it kinda ruined the previous twists. Great episode, still.\n\nEdit: After thinking about it a little more, I think I can sort of see what they were going for with the ending. It shows how even with all the horrifying shit he went through in the experiment, his real worst nightmare is losing touch with his mother. Also, it shows how hyper realistic VR makes it impossible to know what is truly real. I still think the ending is a little too redundant and inceptiony, but I can at least appreciate it on some level. ",
