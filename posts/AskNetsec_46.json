I am currently in the Cyber field and have overall greater than 8 years experience in the following domains; router/switch/network domain, analysis/rmf/cyber, administration...\n\n\nI am a jack of all trades (well, minus programing. I am okay with Python, linux, and a tiny but of sql, but that is it), and recently found my way into the cyber community and I am employed as such.\n\n\n\n\nI have many certs, but also want to finish my degree. I am stuck at a crossroads, so here is my question;\n\n\n\n\nI could finish a cyber degree in 1 year by transferring all my credits. Only, it will cost me 10k/15k to finish. I am weary of cyber degrees, and don't really trust their authenticity (idc what university they come from, it's just weird and new and the curriculum isn't really right). \n\n\n\nOn the flip side, I could attend a university and get a degree in computer science. I have a lot of the curriculum done (math/science/extras), just not the core stuff. It would be cheaper overall as a family member works there, but take much longer (probably at least 2 years).\n\n\n**HERE IS A BIG ONE;** I don't want to put my eggs in the wrong basket. If devoting time to the computer science degree isn't worth it for one reason or another, forget it, I will do the cyber degree. I know certs are king now, but moving up the ladder with eventually require me to have one, if not a masters also.\n\nI would obviously rather get it done faster, even though it will suck some money from me, and not doing it at all isn't an option because if I want to get into upper management, I believe they want to see someone with a degree. Regardless, I don't want to waste the time I spent in my other major, or die without a degree... this is something I want. \n\n\n\n\nWhat is the general take on cyber degrees? Is it worth it, or is it a joke? Help me know what I should do.",

        "text": "Edit: Before you say it, I state again that I know it isn't actually secure. The reason I designed it is to understand **why** it isn't secure and learn from it, not to use it.\n\nSo, in a personal project of mine, I've built an auto-relog system.  \nIts purpose was so that if you logged in on a secured page once (say, an SSL protected login page, on a secure network), you could from that point on relog automatically every time you visited the site from this device, on any page and network. Now, after some tinkering, I've come to the following protocol. Before I continue, I know it is still vulnerable to session hijacking and probably a few other things due to lack of authentication, feel free to note the other vulnerabilities if he controls all the info and doesn't just listen. Now, the protocol:\n\nContext:  \n**AES-ECB** (or CBC, but that would just force a constant byte of padding to the end of the 1 single block we'll always have)  \n**publicKey, 256 bit**  \n**Secure connection on initial login**  \n**P1, 128 (or 120) bit** Plaintext, randomly generated  \n**IV, 128 bit** Initiation Vector, randomly generated  \n**Attacker** - all of the communication from the user and server to the other (after Step 0) goes through him  \n\nStep 0. On successful initial login, the server saves a 128 bit randomly generated plaintext P1, and a 128 bit randomly generated IV. It saves them, and sends them to the user.  \n\n*Repeated*  \nStep 1. Calculate the following Offset:  \nOffset = P1mod128 + (P1/128)mod128 + ( P1/(2^(7*2)) )mod128 + ... ( P1/(2^(7*17)) )mod128  \n\nStep 2. P1' = P1 &lt;&lt; Offset\n\nStep 3. encrypt(P1', publicKey, IV) *^(Is this redundant? Doesn't really add much security)*  \n\nStep 3.5 Attacker reads the message, can decrypt with publicKey it to find (P1' XOR IV)  \n\nStep 4. Server decrypts message, XORs with IV, shifts right by Offset.  \n\nStep 5. If the plaintexts match (static time comparison), generate new plaintext P2.  \n\nStep 6. P2' = P2 &lt;&lt; Offset\n\nStep 7. encrypt(P2', publicKey, IV)  \n\nStep 7.5 Attacker reads the message, can decrypt with publicKey it to find (P2' XOR IV)  \n\nStep 8. User receives the message, XORs with IV, shifts right by Offset, and saves it as his new P.\n\n[Here is an illustration](https://i.imgur.com/uUFAkbj.png)  \n\nRight now, I'm trying to understand all the possible vulnerabilities here. I've built the offset to have a \"pretty even\" distribution so the chance to shift left by X bytes is approximately similar, but apart from that I've wasted at least an hour trying to find any useful properties an attacker could use here, and couldn't find any - mainly due to my lack of experience, not cause it's really secure.  \n\nAny chance any of you guys could help me explore all the vulnerabilities here? Specifically both in case the attacker controls all the info, or is just listening (and trying to guess info from the n transmission cycles he heard so far).\n",

I thought it would be useful in terms of security to have an IDS/Light IPS over my network. Other people use my network and I don't want to have false positives being actively blocked and have them yell at me because they can't get on $sitename or download $program_name, so I would rather it be an IDS that just warns me if something is going on and let me decide if its an issue or not. I looked at security onion but I couldn't figure out how to get it to work over wireless, in fact, I'm pretty sure it can't work over wireless, which is a shame since its 2017 and 98% of the devices in my house are wireless.\n\nAnyone have any resources on creating a WIDS?

I am currently at a place in my life where I can work freelance for the UK equivalent of ~£50/$65 per hour (this amount is relevant to my question).\n\nafter 7 years of study and 2 years of work I do not think medicine is for me for many reasons (I would be happy to expand if anyone is curious). I come from quite a techy family (parents and cousins in software development/data analytics and network engineering) and have always had an interest in the tech world. I'm now considering it as an alternative career.\n\nI've been doing an online intro to computer science course (CS50 from Harvard) and am gaining some experience in writing code and have been enjoying it. If I decide to pursue the software development side of things my plan would probably be some more online courses, probably a MSc in some  sphere of coding/development and then try and find a graduate job.\n\nThe other field I am curious about and considering is cyber security. With my (arguably irrelevant) qualifications what would my options be with regards to entry level jobs in the field? If I were to study over the next 6months-year are there any certs (e.g security+ etc) that I could get that would allow me to walk into a job that would pay decent money (~£30k/year) to what I am earning now but also provide training opportunities in the field and the opportunity to progress?\n\nAnother option I have is to do a 1 year MSc in cyber security once I have built up a bit of foundation knowledge on my own steam.\n\nWill any of this help or is the only way in without a comp sci degree starting right at the bottom on a help desk for $15/hr and working your way up? \n",

I’m very interested in network security, reverse engineering, pen testing (I know it’s starting to jump around into different categories. Still working out what I really want to do.) While searching for online colleges I’m finding several different degrees, bachelor’s in computer science, bachelor’s in information assurance, Cybersecurity, etc. \n\nWhat I’m wanting to figure out is if any of these are specifically more beneficial to someone in the beginning of their career. I’ve been working at a MSP for the past 15 months as a help desk technician II and am wanting to start moving into a more security-related field. I also am enlisted in the Air National Guard with a top secret clearance and CompTIA’s Sec+ certification where I work as a sys admin to put it simply. Due to how our base has been moving, my job mainly consists of patch assessment and application, performing basic maintenance on our network equipment, and ensuring the base has access to network shares, etc. with permission management.\n\nThere is currently only one company near me that actually hires pen testers but was not able to find much more information on them or what other kinds of jobs they hire through their website, so that is why I am more leaning towards a career in pen testing. (Recently married and still sorting our lives/careers out here where we live with no interest in moving any time soon. Obviously drastic circumstances could cause us to need to but nothing foreseeable)\n\nAny advice, recommendations, or even just pointing me to some other information is greatly appreciated!

        "text": "Hi.\nI have gotten a new pc after deciding to have my old pc be completely offline.\nSo I just took out the ethernet cable and took out my wireless network adapter card.\nAnd I disabled and uninstalled my network adapter controller, and disabled my ethernet controller in device manager.\n\nThe thing is that even after that I was monitoring network activity in task manager/resources, and I spotted registered activity in the resources monitor internet section.\nOtherwise the task manager indicated that \"no active network cards were detected.\"\nI started to wonder how this could be, I remember I had a problem with my previous wireless card before I went to the shop that installed the new one ( which is the one I removed), could it be that the older network card was left in and somehow deactivated and reactivated? Without any feedback from Windows?\n\nI checked the inside of my pc and there were no other wireless cards mounted on the motherboard, and all I can see is my motherboard, my graphics card, my HDD, my power source which is covered and another covered section which I assume is for the processor.\n\nAt this point I got a little paranoid and started to suspect some intrusion in my network.\nI went to the firewall, deactivated all the active network detection rules, and added rules which I assume block all port connections to the send and receive sections. That is for each section I added a rule to block all tcp, all udp, and even rules to block all icmpv4 and icmpv6 requests.\n\nI suppose I could take the pc to a shop and have them check if there is a forgotten wireless card somewhere in my pc, but first I wanted to check if the behavior I saw in the resources monitor, indicating I have internet ( or network activity) when I had none was normal and my pc was in fact completely offline.\n\nI noted down the activity when I spotted it and it was an svchost process that also indicated (\"localserviceandnoimpersonation\"), and then I noticed another svchost process without that classification indication bellow that one. The activity was registered in the TCP connections panel to the right.\n\nAnother thing I noticed, I believe after I clicked a button that said \"image\" were these two orange bars indicating these two processes were actively filtering the two boxes bellow.\nI also noted down that one of the processes I believe was associated with the 1900 port, and another one had a mix of letters and numbers starting with \"f0\" something. I think one of them was also associated with \"loopback ipv6\" and \"loopback ipv4\". I am sorry but I was not careful in taking those notes at the time so there is some confusion I admit.\nAlso one of these active svchost processes had an ip indicated, 239.255.255.250 which I believe (but am not sure) was not my ip.\nBefore I removed the wireless card I also had windows firewall logging turned on for all my profiles, and after I removed the card when I checked the log text file I still saw send/receive activity labeled as ALLOW UDP, ALLOW ICMP to the IP 127.0.0.1.\nI searched about this ip and found out this was akin to my pc \"calling home\", so is this activity normal even if my pc has no hardware network connection and I added those port blocking rules to the windows firewall?\n\nPlus I have an entry of activity in my firewall log that says DROPPED ICMP to a send request tied to the ip: fe80::fd6e:45a:1b8d:50f4 ff02::16. How can my firewall be dropping (I assume rejecting) send requests if my pc is simply offline? That is when no wireless adapter card is in ( I assume) and no ethernet connection is plugged in?\n\nThanks in advance for any info.\n",
