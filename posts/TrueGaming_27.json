        "text": "So, I've been reading/watching a lot of content analyzing various games, esp. RPGs and adventure games. You know, the big open world ones like Daggerfall and Ultima (and some old, obscure game called Skyrim). And if there's one thing that I've seen reiterated through all of this it's an utter hate-on for maps (well, specifically mini-maps, but I personally don't see much difference). People complain that they make the game too easy, and they miss \"the days when NPCs would give you directions and you actually had to read and pay attention.\" (Ignoring the fact that there were never days when that was the only approach).\n\nAnd, I guess I understand missing more in-depth world interaction, but removing maps is not the way to go about it. Because, at least for me, maps are an immersive way to remove unnecessary burden from the player. Or, to put it another way: if we are going to forego any visual aids to help in navigation, then why have any visual aids at all? Why force the player to have a tiny little notebook at their side at all times for them to write the entire game script in? What's the benefit? Why make the player do all this tedious work that we have even solved in the real world for hundreds of years instead of enabling them to do what they *want* to do, that is, interact with the world? Especially when said forcing is more immersion breaking than anything. Think about the last time you gave someone a location: you probably gave the place and its relative location to some landmarks around it. Think about the last time you were given a location: you didn't know where one of the landmarks was, so you looked it up on a map. Maybe that's just me, but that's far more, well... normal than \"go north of here, then east at this rock, south at the tree, west to the other town, and then it's east by northeast for a day.\" That's.... worthless. Especially if it blends in with everything and can only be gotten once.\n\nSo, again I ask: why do people hate maps so much?",

        "text": "After replaying Luigi's Mansion recently, I must say...while it certainly is way, way, WAY too easy to be classed as a traditional survival horror game, it is a truly amazing parody of (spoiler alert) the original Resident Evil on top of already being an excellent game in general. Seriously, pretty much everything that I loved (and also hated) about RE1 and even its remake is all here in spades.\n\nIt's got (a MUCH more functional version of) RE1's laboriously awkward tank controls (fitting for Luigi because of how generally awkward he is in the game), the obligatory cheesy-line-dispensing sidekick (Dr. E Gadd, basically playing the role of Barry Burton), the very VERY over-elaborately designed haunted mansion (complete with the very VERY overly drawn-out door-opening cutscenes, which are thankfully skippable this time), the very aggressively centralized theme of exploring the game's mazelike world quite literally top-to-bottom and collecting keys and artifacts all the while in order to open previously locked doors and advance the plot (which, just like in RE, is pretty unusually deep and thought-out for the type of game that this is), and most importantly the very VERY ominous and unsettling atmosphere (most ESPECIALLY for a kids' game in this case)...\n\n...not to mention the character that can only attack at long range (go ahead, just TRY using the knife effectively in RE1), the annoying emphasis on constantly examining every single thing in every single room that you go into, (a toned-down version of) the good old fixed camera angles, the extremely bizarre and unorthodox save system (only here it isn't arbitrarily limited by consumable items), the final boss that really, REALLY isn't as tough as it looks, and even a VERY similar \"facing one's fears\" moral message driving its storyline, in addition to the game also coming out on Gamecube at around the same time as the first RE's world-renowned \"REmaster\"...\n\nAnd at the center of it all was Luigi dressed up as a Ghostbuster, sucking up ghosts with a vaccuum cleaner. Seriously, how much more brilliant of a premise for a game than this CAN you come up with? Honestly, as crazy as it might sound, this is actually a more traditionally horror-themed game than Resident Evil 4-6, and it's a god-damned MARIO game. Bravo, Nintendo, bravo.\n",

It is a stealth heavy game with lots on emphasis on WW2 firearms and weapons especially Sniper Rifles(as seen from the sheer amount of attributes like muzzle velocity, wind and zoom level all of which have to be accounted for while making a shot.), in the WW2 Italy setting and the Germans as the enemies. \n\nWhile a lot of features like the vastness of levels and shooting have been appreciated as seen by the reception by the reviews and user reviews, no one talks about how this game runs at 1080p/60 fps on the PS4 ( 40-45 when things become heavy or there's a lot to process, like a view of a big area) and the sophisticated AI that has unique reactions to even the smallest is actions like throwing a rock on their head aside for being very good in general. These two features are very rare to find together(the only examples I can think are MGS:V and Hitman Season 1) on consoles. \n\nLet's now take a look at Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. It is also a stealth game set in a futuristic cyberpunk world of 2029 and has the protagonist(Adam Jensen) powered with new augmentations like Icarus Dash and Tesla gun arm which are like the powers in Dishonored. Sad thing is its publisher was very greedy and did things like forcing the developer to cut the game in half for future sequel and adding microtransactions two weeks before launch, which greatly harmed the game's reputation so much so that the game itself is hardly taked about on its positives and features. This game has amazing level design with awesome powers, something a lot of Dishonored and stealth fans want, an astounding cyberpunk world(I don't think need to explain how famous and in demand cyberpunk games are) and an improved dialogue system from its predecessors, a thing most of the RPGs don't get right. Don't get me wrong the game has flaws especially the optimization(but the visuals are way beyond pretty) but it didn't get awareness even after having lots of amazing and hard to do features just because of its publisher \n\nI'll end my list here.

It seems \"obvious\" today, but *God of War* used to be considered a \"mature\" game. The aged graphics also don't do it any favors. The button smashing now seems like a relic from a completely different era...and don't even get me started on the sex scenes.\n\nEDIT: Generally speaking, 2D games with sprites that don't involve obnoxiously long attack animations and/or grinding/farming things for hours on end have aged decently. Also many classic Nintendo games, like Smash Bros. even *Majora's Mask* have aged well. I would say most turn based RPG games have aged terribly though.\n\nAs for more games that have aged well: the *Half-Life* series, *Beyond Good &amp; Evil,* every main *Metal Gear Solid* game except for 4, *Devil May Cry 1/3* (gameplay only)*,* *Ico, Shadow of the Colossus,* *Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay,* *Okami, Resident Evil 1, 2, 4, Okami, Persona 3-4, Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter: Precursor Legacy, Crysis, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl* (these two games are over a decade old!)*, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Silent Hill 1/2, Fallout 1/2, F.E.A.R.,* and *Psychonauts.*",

One would think the devs can see the failure happening and change course, but I rarely see that happen (Final Fantasy XIV being the one exception I've found).\n\nDoes anyone have ANY idea why/ this happens?  Obviously, some dev teams are just incompetent, but they can't ALL be incompetent.  Is there a common element to these stories that I'm missing?

Many people will criticize games for having poor mechanics or visuals, and then someone else will reply and tell them that they can just install a mod to solve it.  \n  \nI think this is interesting because it seems like you can't always criticize a game if there is a community made fix readily available.  \n  \nI see this a ton with the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series. Due to the work of a dedicated community, almost all of the games shortcomings can be solved with a click of a button if you have Nexus Mod Manager installed.  \n  \nRecently I talked with someone who hated New Vegas because they hated the mouse movement. Now, I know for a fact that this could be a 5 minute fix that would get them back in the game, but I don't think that it justifies the problem in the first place. I believe the criticism is still valid.  \n  \nOr Dark Souls PC. When complaining about the awful port, almost always will someone show up with a link to DsFix that'll remedy many of their issues with the game (at least visually.)  \n  \nBut does that mean the game is bad? In its unaltered form, you could say it is. But with a quick 5 minute fix you'll be right back in and might be able to say that the game is actually a lot of fun.  \n  \nI guess the question I'm posing is this: is heavily criticizing games on PC for easily fixable issues a fair thing to do? And should we mention that our love for certain games comes from the use of community fixes while admitting the base game isn't that great?  \n  \nI'd love to hear what you guys have to say on this.  \n  \nEDIT: Loving the responses guys. I agree with a lot of your stances.  \nI typed this up quick before class so sorry if I worded some things poorly, this post isn't meant to defend either viewpoint.

In the fan base of many franchises, specific games in that series are viewed are disliked, viewed as inferior, or are straight up seen as bad games.

Here are some of mine.\n\n**DMC: Devil May Cry**: This is honestly my favorite Devil May Cry game and one of my favorite action games of last generation. I've always liked the other games in the series, but for some reason I especially liked DMC. The fluidity of the combat and the interesting art style hooked me. It was only later when I realized that most of the Devil May Cry community either dislike or vehemently hate this game.\n\n**Batman Arkham Knight**: Many people consider this their least favorite in the series, but I like this entry the most. The batmobile was often cited as a major negative, but I never minded it. Additionally, I found Gotham incredibly beautiful and never felt so much like Batman.\n\n**Bioshock 2**: IMO I think this is the best Bioshock game in every category except for story. Mechanically it is fantastic and it's level design is an enormous improvement from BS1. I think this game often lives in the shadow of the original game.\n\nI'll add some more if I remember.\n\nAnyways, I want to know what you think.

That may sound weird to some of you, but in my opinion the exploration in hollow knight feels much more rewarding than in 90% of similar games because it lacks a certain feature.\n\nYou can recognize it in the title. This game deliberately renounces any transcription of your progress.\n\n- No percantage marker about how much you have already explored in the game\n- no x of y left\n- no questlogs where everything is marked as doable or not doable from the start (its up to you to decide if there is more to some npc's as it seems)\n\nultimately it feels much more refreshing to play a game where I don't have to worry if I've done everything which the game offers me. Especially if it follows such an open structure like Hollow Knight.\nMaybe there are some secret sections, cutscenes or bosses I do miss, but you know what? It doesn't matter to me as long I don't know of the existence of these cause what I don't know won't hurt me.\nIn best case I stumble to these parts on a repeated playthrough, so there may be some surprises left this is what makes these games so special, even if you finish them, the air of mystery remains.\n\nFor those people who need chronically an confirmation that they've done everything what the game has to offer, there is still the internet where you can read everything over, so I don't see any reason why the game should tell me everythingof its details from the start by quantifiying all progress.\n\nThere are so much games I could enjoy much more when that wouldn't be the case, a good example for this is the yakuza series, where even the smallest activitiy is embedded in some sort of progression log. I don't want these things, I want to discover everything on my own.\nIf there are some entries blank or if an percantage counter is not completetly full, I as the player get the impression that I still have to do things, that I haven't really play the game to its fullest or that I may miss some important parts. It constantly gives me the feeling of that I \"miss\" something, even when these things are trivial.\n\nGetting 100% is not fun at all most times. Really often it requires grinding or some boring activities and sidequests. You may enhance the experience by making these things better, but there are still some people who don't enjoy certain stuff. I really want to decide for myself when I think I've done everything what the game was able to offer me. Dark Souls is a good example and follows exactly the same design paradigm than hollow knight.\n\nIts much more surprising and satisfying to stumble on secrets at random than just reading over them in the internet. If there are secrets which are liked to a visual indicated completion counter it gets really bothersome, you will search the entire game for something well hidden, just because it was told to you that there maybe something special, such things shouldn't be indicated at all, what is the point of a secret if the game is telling you indirectly that it exists somewhere?\n\nIn such cases you practically are forced to use the internet or quitting the game with an \"uncompleted\" feeling.\n\nSometimes less, is much more. I really hope that much more games will take an example to Dark Souls or Hollow Knight, not just because their penalty systems, there is so much more to these games, because they are able to surprise, that they are able to maintain an aura of wonder and mysteriousness through the entire game. \nI really wish gaming overall could be more often like this.\n\n\n",

        "text": "I tend to have a habit of dropping (quit) many games over small features. Maybe they use a mechanic I dislike, like a timer in which you have to beat the game under, or maybe the game doesn't explain something properly which leads to me giving up. I have so many games, and so many left I wanna play, that something that I dislike can easily make me quit, but I'm curious as to what's the smallest thing everyone here dropped a game over.\n\nFor me, the smallest thing that I ever dropped a game over was the footstep noise of the main character.\n\nThere's actually a pretty long story behind why I did this. Read on if you wanna hear it.\n\nSo back several years back, there was a game called \"imscared\" released on gamejolt, where developers release small indie games they made, generally for free. imscared was a short pixelated horror, and made a decent name for itself. I LOVED this game. It was one of the best horror titles I had ever played. Everything was perfect. It had fantastic retro style visuals, wonderful retro style sound and music, and was scary as hell. It all worked very well together. Somehow, it managed to make even the act of WALKING a tense and enjoyable experience, as every step had a satisfying CRUNCH sound to it that suited the rest of the old retro aesthetic it was going for. This was one of my favorite things about it.\n\nFlash forward a few years later, imscared has been updated several times and released on steam as a full product. I get excited and buy it instantly, only to be extremely saddened to learn that the developer had altered the footstep noise to be an extremely generic high quality footstep noise that sounded the same as every other game on the market, which completely fucked with the otherwise retro feel of the title for me. I still played through much of the game, but this knowledge just kept dragging me down and making me feel sad about the whole thing, that I ended up quitting the game before 100% finishing it (it's still quite a short game so it's not not I was playing for more than like 2 hours), and I know I would have done all the extra stuff if that normal noise was still in the game, and I wrote up a message on the steam discussion page about the issue, to which the developer responded with something along the lines of \"a few people said the sound annoyed them so I changed it\", which made me kind of upset, as he could have made a toggle option for the sound without compromising his original vision and lowering the quality of the game IMO.\n\nI don't know if the developer ever read my other messages, but to this day, this change was the smallest thing that eventually made me quit a game.\n\nLet's hear your stories!\n\nUPDATE: 1000 comments in a day everyone! Thank you so much for all the answers! It's been a joy reading through all the small things that annoyed us to an irrational degree, enough so to outright quit an entire game!\n\nKeep it up if you got any more! I love this!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8tk7n8/the_hype_problem/",
        "text": "The last few weeks have been exciting, leaving us with the usual haul of new information spilled over from E3's various conferences and announcements. The majority of these releases were set for either later this year, or sometime in 2019, which isn't too long of a wait. However, buried within this next batch of releases are a few that we've been waiting quite some time for, like the fabled *Kingdom Hearts 3*. \n\nWhat followed the announcements, other than the collective sigh of relief, was a discussion of hype and its use in marketing by gaming developers/publishers. One can agree that companies like Nintendo or people like Hideo Kojima made excellent use of hype strategy to generate interest in their new games. Others, apparently, do not. \n\nOne of these discussions came in the wake of a [recent talk with Tetsuya Nomura of Square Enix](https://twinfinite.net/2018/06/kingdom-hears-iii-final-fantasy-7/), who felt that their announcement of major projects like Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 7 remake were too early in their development. He went on to further state that they did so in pressure of either fans who were begging for information or the potential of leaks or false rumors.\n\nThat being said, a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/8takjo/tetsuya_nomura_admits_kingdom_hearts_iii_final/) discussing the article seemed to have a split opinion about the announcements, whether they agreed that the announcements *were* too early, or that SE's reasoning behind making those announcements was sound. Some said what got me thinking about this, which was that companies \"overhype\" their projects, leading to massive disappointment in the final product.\n\nThe first example of this issue that came to mind was *Final Fantasy XV*. With a decade-long development cycle, much of which was apparently spent on refocusing the game a number of times, the expectations of the game were definitely pretty high. Once it released, it didn't seem to blow people away as much as they expected, with aggregate user review scores averaging about 7-8. A lot of negative commentary about the game boiled down to \"this isn't Final Fantasy\". And I felt that much of this was due to only minor issues with the game. While I personally loved the game, and agreed that it had some of those issues, to other people those issues were amplified in part because of the wild expectations that were created of it.\n\nWhat we get from this situation is that hype can be dangerous. It's said to be part of the reason why *Half Life 3* isn't being developed, since nothing can possibly live up to those expectations. And, as stated before, some say that Square Enix is doing the same to titles like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy. \n\nI'm not exactly convinced that it's entirely SE's fault, as their reasoning was pretty sound: Announce nothing, and risk fans leaking surprises or spreading false rumors that hurt the game. And this has been shown, year after year, E3 to E3, to be true. I think that the other half of the overhype problem comes down to fans that do that kind of thing. Regardless of what a devoper does, there will always be people making things up, over-speculating, and perpetuating the overhype problem without even realizing.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a point to be made here, and it's relevant to one of the games we've talked about. First off, regardless of *when* an announcment is made, the developer is still going to spend the same amount of time making the game, and the player is still going to spend the same amount of time waiting for the release of that game. Square Enix may have a rocky development situation with their huge projects, but they address this with frequent smaller releases and extra content to tide fans over.\n\nSecond, a developer needs to be able to take its time when it is working on a huge undertaking. What I feel is the biggest downfall of a title isn't the hype itself, but the impatience of the fans that feel entitled to these projects faster than they can reasonably release.\n\nWhat I personally fear for is the development of the Final Fantasy 7 remake. \n\nFinal Fantasy 7 is considered by most to be one of the greatest games of all time. It is a masterpiece in terms of story, story-progression, and ground-breaking RPG style (at the time). To have finally announced a remake to bring this story to the modern gaming era was Square Enix's greatest gift to mankind, at least to many fans of the original.\n\nI feel that, while the announcement *was* very early, this game is going to need all the time it can get to be perfect. I'm okay with waiting so long as the final product is as good as SE wants it to be. Episodic release? A-Okay as long as each release is a deserving, full release as they say it will be. I just want to experience this game as intended, the fans' opinions be damned.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, here? Am I alone in being patient? Did Square Enix jump the gun?",

Uniquely, your goal is not to make yourself as powerful as possible for each mission, because in this game power costs money and money is life (and your score). Run out of money and it’s game over, permanently. Death costs a nasty 100k, but a full uber loadout with medpacks and ammo could cost you 400k plus. You only get maybe 200-300k for a successful mission, so you balance your budget with the task before you, “levelling down” your avatar to increase your profit. It’s a great way to get players self-adjusting each mission into the sweet spot of difficulty and challenge. I feel players can more accurately judge this than the developer could with say an algorithm (the levels are randomly generated, and each player has different styles and strengths).\n\nWhat other games motivate you to self-adjust your difficulty with mechanics?",

At all...\n\nEA is working on at least 2 Star Wars games - the rebooted Visceral Games title and Jedi: Fallen Order that was \"revealed\" during E3. We know EA is done doing single-player linear adventures, and there are [rumors](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-open-world-game-is-in-development-at-ea-/1100-6457652/) the next one is going to be a big open-world game.\n\nBut after what happened with Battlefront 2, I just can't get excited for any of that... \nI used to be a pretty big fan of the movies and older games (The Old Republic is literally the only MMORPG I've played for more than a month), but now? Both are kind of disappointing to me, especially the games.\n\nI mean, an open-world Star Wars game sounds amazing, and if Respawn is working on an actual good shooter with Fallen Order than I should be jumping for joy.\n\nBut I'm not, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n\nIf you're like me, what will it take for you to be excited about future Star Wars games?\nAnd if you are expecting the future Star Wars game, I'd like to hear why.

        "text": "For some reason I initially waited on finally picking up TLOU and when I finally did I chose to play it on the hardest and most unforgiving difficulty. I forget what it was called, 'brutal' or 'realistic' probably.\n\n\nI rarely if ever try games on the most difficult setting, maybe after an initial playthrough and then if the gameplay is still fun.\n\nI think I did this based on the tone and seriousness that the game conveyed.  Based on what I'd known about it and also based on that grim main title screen, I could feel I was in good hands; my feeling was that TLOU was something very memorable. This was a Naughty Dog game and I'd played the first three uncharted games but while I was aware that TLOU was going to be the same mechanically and gameplay-wise, I knew that the experience would be a different beast.\n\n\nMy experience with the story is like anyone else's who has been in awe of the game. Plenty have lauded and praised TLOU for the experience through its storytelling and fleshed out characters; it really is such an amazing game in that regard, but I'm just here to share my experience of playing with no real idea of what I was getting into and on the hardest difficulty.\n\n\nThis game is fun. Like objectively fun. Fun in all the ways a game should be fun and also for me, personally. I like violent games that incorporate stealth and tension and also action and fury.\n\nControlling Joel and Ellie rewarded patience and precision in a way that satisfies a player like me. I loved completing a section of gameplay with the games fluid and tight controls. They rarely if ever 'betrayed' me and I never felt cheated when I died. \n\n\nPlaying TLOU on its hardest difficulty setting on your first EVER playthrough is fun for a variety of different reasons.\n\nThe game is punishing and more immersive, there's no HUD, enemies were tougher (at least I assume they were?) and whatever scarce aid and resources I found I could only ever save for the potentially brutal encounter I predicted would be coming just around the bend. I learned to prepare and sharpen my strategy. \n\n\nI literally never shived an enemy, only choked them and every piece of metal I found hiding in a cupboard or drawer, I saved for those hidden doors containing aid and ammunition.  I needed the health more than anything.  \n\nSometimes a section would come up where Joel and Ellie had to just survive, or I'd face a boss that was it's own singular challenge and when a section like that became unbeatable I would have to backtrack and reload a previous save so I could undo upgrades to my weapons or gear and perhaps roll them into something else. This isn't anything new I know but it doesn't happen too often. \n\n\nMost modern games, and especially AAA titles I feel, are designed to be played hard and fast and whatever incorrect decisions you may have made to your character's abilities are usually forgiven so the player's progression is steadily forward. Not all games and not all ways, but sometimes. \n\nIt was fun but it was also entirely not fun too. This game was a labor that I really wanted to conquer. \n\n\nThe good thing is TLOU is achievable, doable. I would come to look at each stealth encounter or shootout as a puzzle and as a player I felt I could solve that puzzle. I could survive it and while the game was daunting to say the least, I never felt it was impossible. \n\n\nI've played shooters and other adventure games where the 'brutal' or 'realistic' difficulty settings seem almost tacked on just because it's something to add after 'Hard'. Some appear as though they've never been tested by the developers to see if they were even possible.  \n\n\nI specifically remember Metro: Last light as an example. I remember that even after I'd made a point to be frugal and decisive with my ammunition and supplies in this empty-shelled radioactive wasteland, I would still find myself without any hope as I unload every single rare bullet I had taken the time to hunt for- still being just not quite enough. That kind of frustration is off-putting, at least to me. \n\nGames with that kind of callous difficulty settings are a joy if they can still be looked at as achievable and I see them as a reward for perseverance through your deliberate actions. That's what I saw happening in TLOU. \n\nEven in the last final sections of the game where Joel is alone and he has to make his way to where Ellie is being held and there are multiple patrolling thugs around each corner that could spot him at any time if he takes out the wrong guy first or the right guy in the wrong order. It's a puzzle, a puzzle with a solution that, not unlike the latest Hitman game is solved through a combination of repetition and quick control reflexes. \n\n\nI felt my experience with TLOU was perhaps a bit different than most. I mean, it wasn't the *hardest* game in the world but still it wasn't a cakewalk.  \nI also wonder if the difficulty included side effects. \n\nDid it make me care more about the characters? Was the story bleaker to me? Did the scarcity of player resources give the dystopian settings a bigger sense of empty hopelessness? \n\nI won't ever know because you only get to play a game for the first time, once.",

        "text": "The post: [Games that feel too long and how they ruin the experience](https://redd.it/8szmmu) from the other day got me thinking. Back when achievments were introduced to pretty much every game I remember seeing the extremely low completion (**of the main story**) rate for games. It's interesting to think about in regards to other artistic mediums. Do you ever just stop listening to music half-way through? Some people will quit a movie, or mini-series -- but is it really at as high of a rate as games?\n\nWell I spent the last day grabbing up [data from a bunch of games](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17XDvG-oJlYDHmVoDYdqqGlS1JC0MdRuuCe5uVm8GXaM/edit?usp=sharing) from the different services (Steam, PSN &amp; XBL) to compare them.\n\n***This is not comparing games by quality or ratings -- instead by how many people actually finish the main story of a game***\n\nCouple of things to start:\n\n* Many games are given away as part of digital packages, and people have a tendency to buy games on sale without ever playing it. This can put even the first achievement of the game at like 80% completion rates. Because of this, we can divide the final story achievement with the first one, to get a more accurate completion rate. Each service measures these completion rates differently, so this can also help normalize the information.\n* I always tried going to the most \"original\" version of games, since all we want is raw numbers of completion rates. Also \"completion\" as in story completion, not \"100%\"\n* Some games can have different achievements for each individual difficulty, so we can back-up 1 achievement (usually boss battle) to grab that one instead.\n* In rare circumstances, there is completely separate achievement trees for each difficulty -- were possible I simply took the most completed difficulty as the data. However, this can skew the information.\n* Obviously retro games with re-releases might have people buying the product but not completing the games since they've done so in the past.\n* \"faqs\" is user self reporting / survey data from gamefaqs. This can be useful since we don't have achievement/trophy data for Nintendo (and \"retro\") games.\n * The different columns from gamefaqs's user data, is **number of owned** vs **number of completed**. Gamefaqs already displays completion rates, however based on the other services (Steam, PSN and XBL) comparing completion vs ownership might be a better comparison. Regardless, I've included both sets of information.\n* A game like Street Fighter 5, it might be better to use the achievement of \"Complete 5 character campaigns\", instead of \"Complete Story Mode\". \n* Metal Gear Solid V, has some strange achievements for what the \"end\" of the game might be. Let me know if I should correct this information, as it's completion rate is pretty low.\n\n---\n\nSome things I noticed:\n\n* Soulsborne games, in-spite of their reputation actually do not have a lower completion rate than other games. Those games have a higher completion rate than average, for both the user submitted data &amp; achievements.\n* There doesn't seem to be a correlation to the notion that modern games are completed more often. Of course, that comparison is based on self reporting so who knows.\n* There also doesn't *appear* to be much of a difference in completion rates between genres. RTS, FPS, Fighting and so on. You'd expect to see either much lower, or much higher numbers for a specific genre.\n\n---\n\n# Completion rates\n\nGame\t|\tAchievment &amp; Trophy average\t|\tSelf

        "text": "This seems like something that could be fixed so easily. Watching the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer, Sora sounds downright... bad (I was going to say he sounded goofy but then thought about that sounding like a pun or something. Anyway.)\n\nIt always sounds like the same voice actor too, like they just hire one guy for every game. There's so much potential to do all sorts of other voices and voicework. I mean with Sora, it seriously feels like his voice doesn't fit his body. [Link here for the example](https://youtu.be/xBDsGjCpknw?t=16s)\n\nI mean FFXV has the same issue as all the others, but it still was a bit better than... this one and many others. It's one of the reasons I'm not overly optimistic about the FF7 remake. Actually voicing the dialogue for that game just isn't going to feel the same whatsoever, specifically because of this common VA problem.\n\nThese companies clearly want to appeal to a western audience in some ways. This is an easy fix that is in the right direction. Every protagonist shouldn't sound like a variation of Tidus from FFX, or if they're younger, the same raspy \"chosen one\" kid voice. \n\nIt's like there's only four main voices in JRPGs to them. The high pitched protagonists / side characters, or the really low voiced \"tough\" characters. It's just kind of bad design and writing. There's so much to explore out there, and I wish the JRPG dev communities would expand out of it more sometimes. The past few years have had some interesting changes, which is great. But still. Lot more needs to change.",

I've been interested in the genre for several years and have been somewhat following the community and know the basics of gameplay despite never playing one. I've basically only ever played MMORPGS competitively. \n\nWhat's deterring me from just straight up trying fighters out is the steep learning curve. Everyone in the community I've met online and offline have been playing literally their whole lives, since their childhood. From some googling even people making similar post to mine have usually played some fighting games before. I'm a competitive gamer, I understand many people can have fun with a game just playing it casually but that's not the case for me at all. To enjoy a game, I absolutely need to invest in the competitive scene, make constant progress, and play at least decently and somewhat better than the average. \n\nI'm 20 now, never touched a fighter in my life, so would it be possible for me to achieve these goals? When is it \"too late\" to get into fighters to do decently competitively? I'm not anxious about my age per se, I know many pros at the genre are a decade or more older than me. I'm anxious about being stuck in (relative) scrub tier forever, as it seems like 80% of the community already has 1-2 decades of experience under their belt.\n\n I'd like to hear your honest opinions, as I don't want to waste my already limited time and money into something I'll never be good at.

Every single game they product (despite being one a king of sequel-izing the nuts off their franchises) actually connects to the rest of the series. Sure that's fine for casual gamers that might want to jump in at the 4th game in the series but long term fans of a series don't bode well on this front in terms of long term payoff. For examples:\n\nWatch\\_dogs: no relation between 1 and 2. totally different protagonist and setting. \n\nThe division: presumably no connection as inferred from their presentation.\n\nAssassin's creed: odyssey supposedly connects the modern day stuff but if it's like any of the last few games it won't require any more than a basic understanding of the premise. historical stuff is completely standalone. there's no longer anything like the ezio trilogy where fans can see the protagonist grow as you stick with them. that's IMO one of the biggest reasons those games are regarded so well.\n\nghost recon: wildlands has no connection to previous GR games\n\nthe crew: no real story to connect\n\nfar cry: possibly where their idea of having every game be standalone came from as none of them connect in any way.\n\nrainbow six: siege has no story, therefore no connection\n\nAnyone else dying for a longer term connected story like we used to get?",

I've written an [article](https://geekygamingstuff.com/is-battle-royale-game-genre-dead) about it if you wanna read more (I'll tl;dr some views below). \n\nObviously BR is not dead, especially with CoD and BF V coming up with their own BR modes this year. It's been a popular genre for a while (since Arma days) but everything exploded with PUBG and other games soon followed. \n\nAt this point, a year or so later, it just feels like any new BR games or modes for established AAA game titles are simply following a fad way too late just to earn more money. Just look at Radical Heights, they stopped the development and said it was \"too little, too late\".\n\nAs I mentioned, it's a current trend, much like zombie games were a few years ago (and didn't those just annoy the hell out of us after a while :) ). I'm wondering if BR is on the decline or do you think that thanks to the AAA games it will get even more popular and stay relevant for a couple of years more?\n\nI have over 400 hours played on PUBG, I was addicted to it. Recently though, I stopped playing the BR mode and only ever launch PUBG if there's a War Mode going on. \n\nIf I hadn't seen my friend streaming the original Fortnite game before Fortnite BR, I'd have thought Fortnite is just another BR game. So when people say \"I'm gonna go play Fortnite\", usually it means Fortnite BR. It's a shame really and while the original is not a game I would play, it looked pretty fun.\n\nWhat's your view on this topic?",

        "text": "I'm aware that this is a vague question. However, it's exactly the broad, general question I've wanted to definitively answer for a long time.\n\nI'm going to college this fall. I look forward to college as somewhat of a \"redo\" of high school except with all the wisdom and maturity I've gained in my high school years. In this way, it's important to me that I have a healthy and meaningful experience over the next four years. When thinking about this and what I'm going to need in my dorm, I naturally came to this question. Should I bring video game consoles, or will my computer be enough for gaming? How much gaming do I plan on doing? Do I want to play video games? Why?\n\nOn one hand, I'm afraid of how much time and energy video games take from me. I spent way too much time playing video games in middle school and in my freshman year of high school. Even back then I had other genuine interests outside of gaming, but I completely neglected them and chose gaming instead. Part of this behavior was just me not knowing any better. However, I think another part of it was that gaming was much easier to get into and offered me instant gratification. Ranking up in Counter Strike: Global Offensive takes a while, but it was a clear, well-defined goal that I could actively see my progress towards. And even if I didn't rank up, there were still many enticing pleasures in just playing the game: I could successfully instruct and lead my team, I could get cool kills, and I could create new and interesting strategies. Compare this with, say, practicing the violin or working through a mathematics book. The goals in those activities are not predefined. Additionally, the journeys to whatever goals I do make for those activities are not designed by game developers to have little pleasures to hold me over. In fact, they often have many discouraging bumps of frustration. When I acknowledge this difference, it's difficult to not consistently devote my free time to the far more merciful and forgiving video games. What's troubling about this is that I care much more about music and math than I do any video game. I'm currently working toward becoming a math teacher. As a result, I derive a much more \"real\" pleasure from improving my understanding of some mathematical concept than I do from completing an arbitrary level or challenge. You may say that video games don't have to be means to themselves. I generally agree with this. Video games can very positively affect one's mental and social abilities. This brings me to my next point...\n\nOn the other hand, video games can be a very healthy activity. I mean, just look at what I listed as \"enticing pleasures\" in CS:GO. Leading a team? That can be an excellent lesson in cooperation and leadership. Getting cool kills? One could argue it takes considerable humility, confidence, and determination to practice and improve such skills. Thinking of new strategies? That sounds like a great exercise of creativity and imagination. In fact, you know how I said math is ultimately more meaningful to me? This is because I see math as a vehicle to improve our general problem solving skills. Teaching myself and others how to solve hard problems so that we can make ourselves and others happier sounds good to me for my purpose in life. With this in mind, devising CS:GO strategies should be pretty meaningful to me, right? It improves my problem-solving skills and forces me to be creative. Right? I'm not sure. I mean, I definitely think all the video games I played as a kid immensely helped me in my future academic pursuits. Games helped improve my reading, my creativity, my problem-solving, my willpower... the list could be extended on for a long time! An important positive of games to mention is that social element. Whether it be connecting with your friends by playing with them side-by-side, or making new friends online, games are far from the independent, isolated activity that social media and news media think them to be. But, sometimes I'll think: what if I spent more of my time on those other interests in middle school? Sure, games can do all these great things for you, but surely these other more academic interests are more direct and more fruitful ways of improving those aforementioned mental abilities. Again, I'm not sure. I mean, there are definitely a lot of video games I've played that didn't have much to teach me. I feel like only a small proportion of games truly offer a substantial, healthy experience.\n\nI have one last thought. Video games are a kind of media just like books or films. Just like video games, there are plenty of unimportant and \"unhealthy\" books and films out there. But, there also many books and films out there that really challenge you morally and philosophically. In this way, I consider books and films as a possible healthy way to spend my time. Should I treat video games in sort of the same way? Why or why not? I know this a more specific sub-question that branches off from my original question. Feel free to answer either. Thanks!",

As one would expect, academics and gamers the world over have started to weigh in on the situation. I thought I would ask r/truegaming for their two cents and see if I could find good, compelling arguments for either side.\n\nPersonally, as a medical student and a gamer, I find myself in a peculiar position. \n\nMy lifelong passion for gaming is inclined to follow the opponents of the WHO. They say that the classification of video game addiction as a disease is only pandering to the widespread “moral panic” and bias of society against video games. And it seems like anything could be “pathologized” into a disease. A well-meaning psychiatrist could easily fall prey to societal bias (and a family’s pressure) to diagnose a patient that otherwise isn’t addicted to video games.\n\nBut the medical student in me agrees with the WHO. After a couple of years studying disease, I’m inclined to welcome this new classification. The current version of the Diagnostic And Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) has disorders for every psychiatric disease under the sun. From Substance Use Disorders to Paraphilias. Even gambling was added. I feel like the addition of a “Video Game Use Disorder” could really help physicians (especially ones who have never played video games or aren’t familiar with them) to really help diagnose and recognize patients who may benefit from it. On a personal note, I have witnessed at least one close friend that I believe had video game addiction... it got to a point where gaming took precedence over schoolwork, professional ambitions, relationships, etc...",

For example, I feel that I am missing out on the early VR experiences, and doubt people will be moving backwards very much in this genre as the tech takes off. For me, it's both time and money that effects my inability to 'try everything', which can be frustrating. I know I'm going to love a 2D platformer like Hollow Knight, so when my time allows it, that's the type of experience I go for - not something new, risky, or different. Of course there are outliers, but with the amount of content we're looking at these days its become next to impossible to keep up. I remember a time in the early 2000's when I thought to myself, \"Huh. Starcraft. One day I'll check that out!\" and then years pass by and there are thousands of new games...it's insane. I'll never play that game, to be sure. \n\nTL;DR: Are there games or genres you've never had the time, money, etc, for? Do you feel like you're missing out?",

        "text": "For those not following, ICE is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement branch of American government. While they are present at airports, the specific subject matter here is their enforcement of the border with Mexico.\n\nPolitics is quite often a no-go in games. Far Cry 5 almost seemed to be making a statement of revulsion towards \"rednecks\", and many people boycotted the game just believing that. But, the final game had essentially that stereotype on both sides of the conflict, and worked little political messaging in besides vague terms of worry for the future. Modern shooters have to pick their antagonistic nations carefully, often going for easy targets like NKorea or Russia, or PMCs.\n\nWith the acknowledgment that many organizations have bad sides to them, I'm starting to seriously consider whether certain actions and portions of ICE, or more specifically a name tweak for fiction such as \"ICR\" could become a very easy setting for \"waves of enemies to defeat\" without losing a significant portion of the audience to boycotts.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order and its sequel picked a very fantasy setting, but they did show unlike many modern shooters, there's a great benefit to picking a real evil from the world to fight, and doing lots of research to root the struggles in reality - giving stories of Jews in hiding, Germans with doubts of their mission, and all manner of people affected by the Nazi onslaught. It should also be noted that Wolfenstein 2 suffered some blowback because of its marketing, which was very focused around hurting or killing Nazis, and was viewed as \"too political\". The developers, as far as I know, never apologized or stopped on this front.\n\nI understand how a suggestion such as this can seem rooted in anger or immediate opposition, but I'm also trying to be cognizant of how the ICE's methods of operation have been in effect through multiple presidencies; and is only recently hitting such a massive public spotlight. I definitely think that *if* a game used this subject matter to a point it justified (fantasy) killing, it would be critical to do as much research as possible to get details that prevent it from being a \"cheapshot\" on the topic. Including Mexican Cartels as enemies (perhaps early on, before the game reaches scenes that justify its endgame enemies) could also be a good move to show part of the instigation of the situation.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts? Do you think this is too big of a risk for a company to approach?",

This actually ties into this odd current of anti-competitiveness that drives a lot of hardcore gamers these days where anyone who puts in the slightest bit of work at getting better at a game is a \"tryhard\" which is really strange given that the entire point of games is to challenge yourself at a difficult task (outside of story-driven games like visual novels, rpg's, and adventure games such as Quantic Dream's output) and get better at it, but I digress. Sony's trying to rebrand single-player games into cinematic experiences so tightly controlled there's literally no point to not watching them on youtube or twitch and saving your money, but once again, I digress.\n\nI feel that this stems partially from the fact that **multiplayer games often don't foster any sense of community** these days. You are thrown into a skill-based matchmaking system with a bunch of strangers, play, and then do it again. Making friends require you to go out of your way and try to get in touch with the people you're playing with/against, but you can't because they get flung out of and into rooms so fast *and* there's very limited chatting even in PC games. Even PC games like Overwatch often don't include any kind of server browser these days so toxic or annoying asshats can't get kicked so they rage on the mic. In a way, I understand it: if your sole exposure to multiplayer gaming is some 12-year-old on Xbox Live spamming racial slurs into the mic, or your League of Legends teammate flaming you to hell while they're the one dragging the team down, then no wonder so many gamers who would have been about 10-20 during the era of Xbox Live and Playstation Network don't like multiplayer. They don't know the fun of going to a fighting game local and making friends in between matches, or talking about a game on a moderated forum where people try to at least *somewhat* act presentable and not violently toxic at the drop of a hat, or being in a small but well knit server and playing matches against the same people day after day. \n\nThis isn't true for all cases--some people just don't like competing--but I feel that this is a major reason for this violent shift towards hating everything multiplayer and people who like multiplayer games. \n",

Gameplay changes from moment to moment - can the soundtrack keep up and make the game more impactful with changing environments, activities and themes in a freeform way? What games do this well? Are developers sometimes missing a trick?\n\nGames that do this well (for me): Journey, Breath of the Wild, Everybody's gone to the rapture, soulsborne games and shadow of the colossus (through absence of music)",

Would it be possible to create a platform game with ten or more different resources, and how would the gameplay look like? Depending on resource types, it might not be possible to carry all resources in your inventory, but you could still transport it, or maybe even make a platformer in which you can setup a resource chain (program robots to carry steel, or hire peasants to carry wood). Anyway, just curious if anyone thought about it, maybe know such a game, or want to continue brainstorming. :)\n\nPeace!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8sfq31/an_exploration_of_halo_5_and_the_idea_of_free_dlc/",
        "text": "Is anyone else sick of free \"DLC\"? By which I mean specifically companies using microtransactions to make money in place of selling DLC, and instead distributing out their \"DLC\" for free. Now the problems with microtransactions are obvious so I'm not going to go into them here, we know they're terrible. But what's even more bizarrely awful is how DLC has gone from overpriced expansions to just... nothing.\n\nI don't think there's a better example of free DLC done bad than the case of Halo 5. Previous Halo games followed the standard map pack model of the time for their DLC, which was four $10 map packs. While the price is ridiculous the content was substantial, it more than doubled the amount of maps in the base game. Halo 5 changed things by introducing RNG lootboxes that gave you weapons for a multiplayer mode plus cosmetics. But! In exchange, all DLC for the game would be free. The quality of your experience is massively reduced, but hey, at least you get the DLC for free. That saves you $40 on DLC!\n\nBut let's look at what was actually included in Halo 5's DLC. It should be noted that the game launched with an embarrassing amount of content. The arena multiplayer (which, for all of you who haven't played 5, is basically the game's bread and butter) launched with 10 maps. Which sounds alright, until you hear that two were created in Forge (Which is the game's level editor. It's basically the equivalent of a cf_orange map in TF2) and two (count em, two) maps were remixes of the same map. How embarrassing! That mean's there's SEVEN maps on launch for the quintessential gametype. All previous Halo games had about nine unique maps. It should be noted that there were also three maps for Warzone (the shitty microtransaction mode, so I wouldn't say that counts for anything at all) and five maps for breakout (a shitty CS:GO ripoff mode, which I don't think counts, either way these maps were wireframe with incredibly simple design and they're just boring).\n\nThe game also DIDN'T launch with Forge mode for players (a series staple), there was no Big Team Battle (a series staple), no social playlist (a series staple), no action sack (a series staple), no grifball (a series staple) and no firefight (a series staple). It should also be noted the campaign was ass and noticeably lower quality than anything else in the series, it even bizarrely looked worse visually in places than the previous Xbox 360 entry, and, you guessed it, a quality campaign was also a series staple.\n\nSo, this is the first problem. Free DLC here is used as a justification for the game not launching with any content. 343 themselves said that all of it would be added in later, except for a good campaign, via free DLC. And it worked. Instead of accruing universal vitriol (which is what the reaction should've been) the majority of people got hyped for their \"free DLC\" (AKA cut content that got put back in piecemeal). The \"free DLC\" did add in other stuff though, so let's look at what was added.\n\nI'm going to ignore maps that were added to the terrible CSGO knockoff or the shitty microtransaction mode, because honestly those are so low quality that they shouldn't be considered part of the game. I'm also not going to put in maps that were made in the level editor, because quite frankly I could put out maps of just as high quality by myself... when I played Reach as a 13 year old, also those maps were free previously anyways. And obviously I'm not going to include content that was cut from the game and then put back in. I'm not including \"remixed\" content either, since I don't think it should be counted as a new map. I will ONLY include new unique maps for Arena, and new features that are not cut content from the previous games. So we should get a pretty clear idea of how much we actually got from Halo 5's DLC...\n\nFirst major update: Nothing fitting my criteria.\n\nSecond major update: 1 arena map (current count: 8 maps)\n\nThird major update: Nothing fitting my criteria.\n\nFourth major update: 1 new arena map (9 maps)\n\nFifth new update: 1 new arena map (10 maps)\n\nSixth new update: Nothing fitting my criteria.\n\nSeventh: Nothing fitting my criteria.\n\nEighth: Nothing fitting my criteria, but notably there was a new Forge map, and this is where most of the old content was finally added back in. Eight months after launch, the game is almost as content rich as the previous games at launch.\n\nNinth: 1 new arena map (11 maps)\n\nTenth: New custom games browser! A first for Halo!\n\nSo, let's examine what we got with \"free DLC\"\n\n...\n\noh\n\nIn exchange for the game's progression system being basically killed, firefight being ruined by turning it into another microtransaction vehicle, seeing aesthetic-murdering skins in multiplayer (including a literal pizza skin for your guns), we got 2 more maps than were in the base game of Reach? And a server browser? Call me crazy, but I'd rather have a complete game without microtransaction shit that came with map packs with actual content in them.\n\nNow obviously Halo 5 is one example of free DLC being done incredibly poorly, but this is how almost every big AAA studio does \"\"\"free DLC\"\"\"\". Overwatch, two years after launch, has added FOUR new heroes. Battlefront 2 EA has added THREE new maps. Splatoon 1 and 2 basically got away with being released in what would be considered as a BETA STATE in other games by having the promise of \"free DLC :)\".\n\n\"Free DLC\" is a marketing tactic. When people hear those words, they image that they're getting a season pass amount of content for free. But that's simply not true. It's never been true. *It either means that the game is releasing unfinished, or they'll dribble out a pittance of content post-launch to keep people coming back.* So please, don't be tricked by developers saying \"all of our DLC will be absolutely free :) ... now bend over and accept microtransactions\" because that's all it is, a trick.",

Still, would it be true to say that **game studios have invested (money+people) a lot on graphics and not on AI** ?\n\n- 1 DIALOG\n\nAs a quick rough example, when I am plying Assassin's Creed Origin and interacting with random NPCs populating the \"seemingly\" lively world I get the same experience than when i was clicking on NPCs in Planescape Torment (decades agp). Why is that ?\n\nSome would say because of voice acting. Fine. Still, I haven't seen a recent game using text for dialogs and giving me intelligent, contextual dialogs or reactions from NPCs.\n\nAs for dialog system, we are still stuck in dialog trees, decades and decades later. Still going around that tree \"ticking the boxes\" of that tree to test all the lines. NPCs have no memories, you can insult them in one line, and 2 clicks later, ask them for a favor and it works. NPCs know pretty much nothing about the world they live in, besides the 2 lines they have memorized (kudos to Morrowind and the html-like system, at least, anybody would know where is the trader and the army barrack).\n\n- 2 AI\n\nAbout graphics, they are improving games after games, alright we are impressed by the sunsets and by the realistic shadows... but wouldnt we, as players, be as much (or even more) impressed by freakingly intelligent AI in our games?\n\nIs AI too taxing for our CPUs/GPUs ? lets remove the shaders and make impressive AI systems run !\n\nI often feel that the realism and beauty of recent games are just shattered by the stupidity and stiffness of NPCs. take Assassins Creed Origin. It's pretty, but it is just empty, it's a playground, a theme park filled with two dimensional robots. Sadly, ** the animals seems and feel more real than the \"humans\"** in these games.\n\nnow, don't get me started on enemies AI ? I still remember half-life grenade throwing soldiers... since then ? nothing. FEAR did something new (it's the only game that tried something it seems). are we satisfied ?\n\n- 3 QUESTION\n\nThen, why don't game company's invest in AI ? is it much harder than creating amazing shaders ? it is easier to sell beautiful textures than seemingly intelligent enemies?\n\nI personally think, that as players we would be MUCH more impressed and floored by playing against freakingly intelligent AI ...\n\n",

Then why are there even the common weapons, getting the legendary weapons isn't even that hard. For single player games like Origin it doesn't make much sense to me, but OK, I'll accept it. But let's take Fortnite, legendary weapons clearly have an edge over common weapons. Getting them is purely based on luck but it gives an unfair advantage for people with equal skill. It is a battle royale, so I don't see any reason to give some players advantage over others. I mean finding chests or some gear to equip at the start of the game also depends on luck. But this weapon rarity issue can continue through out the whole game. ",

        "text": "I've seen a lot of people laugh and freak out about the WHO classifying \"gaming disorder\" in the ICD-11. Responses have ranged from \"I don't need to take pills to get rid of my interest in gaming\" to \"lol, I have a gaming addiction and I'm proud!\" But if we want to properly address the missteps made in the classification of \"gaming disorder\" we're going to have to have an *actual* conversation about gaming addictions. \n\nI've wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@arielgarlow/stop-freaking-out-about-the-whos-gaming-disorder-and-have-a-calm-discussion-about-actual-gaming-b7bf7f0bc0b8) about my feelings on the matter (if you're looking to engage with the subject in depth, I think it's a good place to start) but here's the TL;DR segments:\n\n* Responses to the classification have pushed me to realise that our fears — while entirely understandable in the historical context of gaming taking the blame for society’s ills — are quite misplaced, and might be preventing gamers and non-gamers alike from having an important discussion.\n\n* when the WHO comes out to say that the recent draft of the ICD includes a “gaming disorder”, many gamers are ready to put up the barricades once again and defend their pastime from another unjust assault - being accused of causing violence, crimes, and mental illness despite evidence and research to the contrary \n\n* That fear-mongering is different from the WHO’s classification of gaming disorder, and unfortunate for us, that means we have to come up with a difference response than the usual “that’s stupid” that would normally fit for when people start blaming axe murderers and child rapists on gaming. Unlike the previous examples, the ICD’s definition of gaming disorder does not implicate gamers in causing problems for the rest of the world — merely causing problems for ourselves\n\n* I still believe we need to address gaming addiction on a level which classifies and diagnoses its existence. We are angry that gamers might once again be thrown under the bus for problems we’re not starting, but we’re also scared of re-examining our relationship and our friends’ relationships with video games as a whole. I have met enough people with gaming addictions to want to do something about it and say something about it — but with this kind of dialogue surrounding gaming addiction, it becomes nearly impossible to approach the subject. \n\n* the most popular solution people offer to gaming addiction is just “go outside” which is not even the beginning of a rigorous solution to the problem. It’s right up there with just saying the sun is literal magic and will fix all of your problems. We’re offered magic instead of real solutions because we’re not even sure what we should do.\n\n* We need to learn about treating gaming addiction accordingly and having people who are actually involved in gaming in healthy ways lead the way to balancing life and pleasure. I cannot state enough that the influence has to come from within gaming culture itself if we’re to have any success, and that means we have to get past our stubborn belief that talking about it makes us a bigger target for non-gaming media to pin their issues on us.",

        "text": "https://www.cagardner.com/blog/2018/6/17/fortnite-is-anti-competitive\n\nOne of my main concerns as Fortnite becomes even more massively popular and now will be funding $100,000,000 worth of tournaments, is that much of the game is specifically designed to be random.\n\nIn my opinion, designed-in randomness reduces expressions of player skill by reducing the amount of agency the player has over the outcome. Some of my main concerns are the random weapon spread, the random circles (which is common to nearly all Battle Royales, to be fair), and the randomness of the loot. \n\nMaybe it's just my own thing, but I can't get into games where the back-and-forth is not 100% player decision driven. I can't watch professional poker, for example, or at least I can't watch after a really bad beat when tons of money is on the line.\n\nThoughts?",

        "author": "Boris-Barboris",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8s0zt6/mechanical_future_of_rts_subgenres/",
        "text": "Current state of the genre is rather well-discussed, so I would really like to talk about the future, particularily the mechanics in imaginary future RTS games. I will start in the following format: \n\nnew or altered mechanic that seems to be a logical development - my vision of how this alteration improves on already established formula or solves existing problems.\n\nThese are some of my thoughts that are mainly focused on casualisation and \"armchair general\" style\\passion, because it seems to me that this is desirable for an RTS game to succeed on the current market. You are welcome to cover other subgenres\\flavors.\n\n**1). Incorporation of the \"order\" concept into the game state**.\nDirect, real-time control of units is usually assumed when we talk about an RTS. This may be changed to issuing delayed, propagated orders (killable horseman, jammable radio network etc...). Such system is resilient to APM-creep and shifts the focus towards preliminary planning\\strategy, wich may be desirable for some developers that want to avoid traditional competitive RTS style of multiplayer. However, this mechanics requires drastically improved unit autonomy and intelligence (self preservation, group AI, target selection) in order to maintain the visual fidelity\\interest of the combat. If someone knows games that do this, please tell me.\n\n**2). AI delegation. Officers.**\nSome city-building games take the path of incorporating ingame assistants to perform routine tasks. Some games make those assistant parts of the game state. For example, Dwarf Fortress allows to assign a manager dwarf that will be responsible for controlling production of specified goods via the same job order system the player originally used. This mechanic is well-suited for tedium\\repetitiveness reduction. Imperative \"to do how\" command style changes to declarative \"to do what\", wich is essential for games that want to scale gracefully with the number of ingame entities. Officer concept can be taken to the extreme in order to create a \"general\" game, that forbids any direct control of units, and relies on the chain of AI command instead. Assigning an officer\\hero to manage your expansion\\flank army is also an interesting idea. General reduction of required player input commands per minute goes in line with some general complaints about RTS games that point out the waste of artist resources on units\\environment the player never has time to admire.\n\n**3). Focus on cooperative control of shared forces.**\nAssuming that typical casual RTS will invest in it's campaign\\single player mode, it seems like an obvious development of the formula to provide cooperative multipllayer for the above-mentioned content, preferably with a difficulty choice to account for increased player side potency and to fuel replayability. Cooperation is inherently more casual, and may allow for better experience for some players. You may have \"that logistics guy\" among your friends that will happily keep your base and economy in order, and \"that protoss dude\" that will feel great at the front line microing your units. People enjoy RTS games for different things and may benefit from a system that allows them to focus on what they particularilly like. Also, didn't the first Starcraft have this feature?\n\n**4). Logistics-heavy subgenre.**\nFactorio is a stunning success, but it is lacking in the combat\\challenge department. There is a consistent interest in mods that try to add RTS elements to it, wich means that I am not alone in my desire for logistics-towerdefence-RTS hybrid, and there is clearly a market for it. It seems like a lot of casual players enjoy turtling in general, developing on this love should be a good selling strategy. Turtling usually consists of resource management, defence building\\upgrading, space allocation and damage control (static defence repair or mobile units reactive reallocation). Making the \"resource management\" and \"space allocation\" parts more rich seems like a good idea and I would certanly like an RTS game that would take some things away from Factorio in that department.\n\nWhat do you think will happen in the next decade?",
