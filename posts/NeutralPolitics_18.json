As it stands now, we're obligated to approve them, since otherwise we could rightly be accused of not complying with the rules and standards we have set.\n\nBut changing the rules to account specifically for this phenomenon would add an element of discretion. We would go from just looking at compliance with the language and source rules to also determining whether we believed the OP was posting in good faith to get answers to the questions they were posing. This would introduce an avenue for bias, or at least open us up to accusations of bias.\n\nSo, we'd first like to know if the users think this is a big problem on NP?

See footnote page 10 of attached document.  https://www.scribd.com/document/349542716/Top-Secret-FISA-Court-Order-President-Obama-Spying-on-Political-Enemies#from_embed\n\n\nThe document tells a story of how a government contractor was given access to raw (read unminimized) FISA data to search through by the FBI.  When Adm Rogers discovered this he had the access removed and reported this to the court, prompting a review of what happened.  The document is also the results of the review and how to prevent future fourth amendment violations and adherence to minimization protocols (minimization = masked names).\n\nThis was during the time the Nunes memo speaks of FISA court abuse.\n&gt;Neither the initial application in **October 2016**, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.\n\nThe FISA court document mentions many dates from April 2016, to October and September.  See page 9.\n\nHere's a plain english explanation of the legaleze in the above documents for better understanding of the impact and fixes recommended.  https://www.lawfareblog.com/foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court-approves-new-targeting-and-minimization-procedures-summary\n\nFrom the Numes memo:\n&gt;On October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order (not under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a U.S. citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified by the Director or Deputy Director of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General (DAG), or the Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division. http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20180129/106822/HMTG-115-IG00-20180129-SD001.pdf\n\nThe reason this paragraph calls out the fact that this was not under title VII is because the FISA document is about abuse under title VII, specifically the surveillance of US persons under the relaxed rules for surveillance of foreign persons.

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI'd like to break down the memo away from the major political subreddit megathreads a bit. [The memo can be read from this  Scribd link.](https://www.scribd.com/document/370599381/Nunes-Memo)\n\nWith all the speculation bouncing around prior to the release of the memo, it has become difficult to separate what was known vs speculated on regarding the memo and to what degree. I'd like to sort that out to some degree.\n\nI'd also like to sort out where material presented in the memo changes the picture of the ongoing investigations, and where the memo may be misleading. Four possible starting points are: (1) the timing of surveillance on Carter Page, (2) the role of Bruce Ohr in the investigations, (3) the relationship to the Papadopoulos investigation, and (4) the necessity of the Steele dossier to the investigation. I'd love to discuss any other points as well.\n\nRegarding (1), we've heard previously that [Page was under FISA surveillance since 2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576), but I'm not sure where that info comes from (the above has no corroboration in the link). Is the application mentioned in the memo a continuation or a new warrant? If a continuation, wouldn't that make the memo's assertions about the necessity of the Steele dossier misleading? If a new warrant, was he being surveilled earlier? And why was this a new warrant, not a continuation?\n\nRegarding (2), Steele is said to have contacted DoJ through Bruce Ohr. Do we have any additional info on this contact? Was he Steele's only DoJ contact or were there others? What is Ohr's role now? How much do potential conflicts-of-interest regarding Ohr's wife and the DNC matter?\n\nRegarding (3), the Papadopoulos info provided doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the memo's narrative. The memo states the investigation into Papadopoulos began in July 2016, but the FISA warrant for Page didn't begin until October. Is info on Papadopoulos in the dossier, and was the dossier used to begin that investigation? I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here; it seems to me to be another chance to bring up Strzok's name more than anything else, but I'm open to discussion.\n\nRegarding (4), do we have corroboration that McCabe stated the investigation into Page required the dossier information? If true, that might make the FISA warrant originally issud questionable, [or it might not](https://lawfareblog.com/dubious-legal-claim-behind-releasethememo) as discussed in this lawfareblog post from before the public release of the memo. Essentially, the post states that bias in the evidence used to obtain the warrant is not enough to stop the warrant from being issued if the biased information is precise and from a reliable source.\n\nThat's just to get a discussion started - I'm hoping to break down the memo some more and draw connections to info we had before the release of the memo as well.
