        "text": "I know we all are frustrated that more is not being done to combat climate change, however saying that \\*no one\\* is doing anything to work on climate change is actively discrediting those people who are and claiming that we are all doomed and the world will end is not a motivating statement to actually work on fixing climate change. \n\nI actively work on climate change, I have taken a reduced salary that I could have working on getting oil onto the market to instead help fix the climate change problem and there are hundreds of thousands or others (or millions if you include people working overtime manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines, and EVs and such, and even billions we expand it globally to those funding solar projects through taxes and other investments in climate initiatives).\n\nAs someone working overtime and earning less than I could be working to help solve climate change its infuriating to just hear how kids in school and people elsewhere are being told that \\*no one\\* is doing anything to solve it. \n\nIf you want to actually help, then bring attention to those who are standing in the way but give credit to those who are working on the problem. Bring attention to the wealthy NIMBYs who are blocking renewable projects like offshore wind, or mass transit projects (through the use of B.S. environmental lawsuits), or those blocking higher density housing which has a far lower carbon footprint than sprawling suburbs, or those blocking research projects or brainwashing others claiming that climate change isn't real, etc... Be angry at those people, but don't say that \\*no one\\* is working on it. \n\nIn spite of those people standing in the way we have beaten all of our renewable energy goals and dramatically reducing costs of deployment (it's now cheaper than coal and natural gas), we are dramatically reducing the cost for carbon capture technologies (still have a way to go with this and need a carbon tax to fund it, but progress is progress and takes a lot of hard work and money), we are even making significant breakthroughs in technology like nuclear fusion energy (see commonwealth fusion and others) which would easily make mass scale desalination and water transport feasible, GMOs are enabling crops to be resilient for climate change to prevent famines, we're working global monitoring satellite systems to rapidly detect oil spills (and enforce environmental fines) as well as other carbon emissions, people are working hard on developing carbon neutral building materials, we're adopting EVs faster than most projected, battery technology is booming with massive investments in building supply, and there's a ton of other stuff happening to, we just passed a 3 huge bills that each work on climate change in their own ways funding over $600 billion to combat it and reduce costs to implement solutions everywhere.\n\nTL:DR - There are tons of people working hard on combating climate change and investing massive sums of money into the problem and they deserve credit. Point out the bad actors, but don't say that \\*no one\\* is working on the problem, its discrediting to those who are and unmotivating to the future generation. We aren't doomed, we just need to keep working hard, humans have survived worse with less countless times in the past.",

        "text": "According to my math with the benefits given to EVs from government, a $25k EV would be very cheap to lease. \n\nIt's part of Tesla's masterplan to release a very cheap EV. My best guess is that the vehicle will be announced on March 1st.   \n\nAn EV leasing for 250$ pr month will completely blow the car industry which mainly makes it's money on SUVs and pickups. Normal car manufactures loose money or make no money on compact cars. \n\nTesla has indicated that the production cost will be around $20K for their compact. A 20% profit margin for a compact car is unheard of, but should be possible for Tesla due to new ways of production and the fact that EVs has less part - thereby reducing the cost of production when production of scale is reached. \n\nHere are a couple of other points making a Tesla compact EV compelling: \n\n1. Due to fewer parts and an electric engine, there is almost no maintenance on an well produced EV. \n2. Fuel cost is about 50% due to electricity being cheaper than fuel. \n3. Better performance over all (speed, safety etc).      \n\n\nThis might very well be the new model T. An affordable car for the average american.   \n\nI'd love to hear your point of view and get challenged:)",

        "text": "So I’ve seen a lot of posts regarding back to office. This is probably “no shit Sherlock” but here’s my experience.\n\nPre-Covid working in the Technology industry I enabled (before the business) my team to work from home 2-3 days a week for a solid 2 years or so. During this time it then slipped into (as I trusted the process more and more) 3-4 days a week.\n\nWe killed it, seriously. We were so engaged, happy, working extensive hours, collaborating, and even doing things like playing games during break times or post work. Worth mentioned we are also split across 3 states. (Won’t give away the country, let’s just say it’s Kangaroo Land)\n\nThen covid hit - we went full time for 2 years.\n\nNow post Covid - the business said they’re “welcoming us back” for “3 days a week” because “together we collaborate and blah blah blah.”\n\nWe rolled our eyes.\n\nOver the last 6 months we have challenged management, and no one can ever provide a reason “why” to return that isn’t business fluff and buzz words.\n\nNothing.\n\nI even asked where is the measurable benefit and outcomes from being together for 3 days a week and I’m only told it’s just the belief of our CEO and that’s that.\n\nThen, one manager I’m close with slipped with me.\n\nHe said that our government, the treasury, has been and did engage with our company and other major companies to get people back to get the economy going.\n\nI then said to my manager this is the case and he denied. I then said isn’t it odd that every other CEO has this same “belief” even world wide where its 3 days. He didn’t like that comment.\n\nWe as the lower end of the work force, the grunts, the ants, will continue to keep the rich rich and ensure we are spending on useless shit like travel to keep our wages low enough to be too scared to move or protest.\n\nWe will continue to give in and even when proven that at home has better people and financial results, be screwed by the government and big corps.\n\nGive it 6-12 months and we will be in for 4-5 days to return everyone top end douche bag back to their lovely million dollar holidays.\n\nPeople say to stop winging about going back in and how entitled you are - it’s not about going in, it’s about being controlled every Fucken moment of your life to keep every other fucker well fed.\n\nThat’s my rant. That’s my belief in what’s happening, and again maybe it’s obvious.",

        "text": "So, I've been thinking about this, and I'll admit, the very sudden rise of AI concerns me greatly, and I am afraid for it replacing and eliminating tens of millions of jobs. But, that's not the topic here. \n\n**AI and AI generated content is here to stay, so what do we do about it if we want to know what is \"real\" (eg. human created) and what is \"fake\" (AI generated)? I see two options, create things to prove a thing was created by AI, or implement a thing to prove something was created by Humans. Perhaps NFTs are the answer?**\n\nSo I got to thinking, proving that a thing is made by an AI is going to become ever increasingly more difficult (it *will* get better), so what if we do the opposite, and instead valid that a thing was created by humans? But how? So my thoughts drifted, and I settled on a thing that had become a bit of a laughing stock in the tech world... NFTs. Hear me out. \n\nSo, hypothetically, and we're going to \\*wavehand\\* a lot of stuff here; NFTs allows for a thing to be digitally indicate that something is unique, or the first, in the digital space on a blockchain. What if we were to use NFTs as a \"digital watermark\", not as this weird investment thing we did before? \n\nLets take photography for example. There is a story circulating around that an AI generated image secretly won a photography competition in Australia (link at the bottom). This presents a challenge about verifying what images are, and are not AI generated (if we wanted to). But lets say, we developed a new DSLR camera, and built into it that each picture it took was automatically an NFT. This NFT, by virtue of being associated with this brand of camera, can be proven to have been taken by human hand, in the real world. \n\nTake it one step further, say the same company as the camera put out editing software, but it only accepted images into it for editing with the NFT provided by the camera. The software would be designed by the company to have no AI assisted features; that's the specific selling point. It would then output a picture, as a new NFT, perhaps paired with an ND5 Hash (NFT to prove source based on the blockchain, and Hash to prove it hasn't been modified further), which indicates that it was taken by hand, and edited in a non-AI assisted software. One step further, a browser extension could be designed to read the NFT watermark as having been from X editing software, and Y camera, proving that it was done by a human, not AI. Thus, from camera to consumer we could prove no AI was involved (as long as that is the aim). And I suspect this sort of concept, if functionable, could be used in other places as well.\n\nNow, I'm absolutely no expert on the specific working of NFTs or Blockchain. And I understand this would probably create some major inter-operability problems between programs, and is probably niche; I just see a real need, or opportunity in the future to *prove* if a picture, song, website, news story, etc. is made by human hand, or a machine.",

        "text": "For the first time, scientists have used machine learning to create brand-new enzymes.\n\nAs reported Feb, 22 in the journal Nature, a team based at the Institute for Protein Design at UW Medicine devised machine-learning algorithms that can create light-emitting enzymes called luciferases. Laboratory testing confirmed that the new enzymes can recognize specific chemicals and emit light very efficiently. \nTo create new luciferase enzymes, the team first selected chemicals called luciferins that they wanted the proteins to act upon. They then used software to generate thousands of possible protein structures that might react with those chemicals.\n\nDuring laboratory testing, the researchers identified an efficient enzyme, dubbed LuxSit (Let there be light). The enzyme  performed the desired chemical reaction. Refinement of the enzyme led to dramatic improvements in performance. An optimized enzyme, dubbed LuxSit-i, generated enough light to be visible to the naked eye. It was found to be brighter than the natural luciferase enzyme found in the glowing sea pansy Renilla reniformis.",

        "text": "I've been thinking about how climate change will affect my family, esp. children that we are planning to have. The impacts are continuing to get more severe and our governments can't meet their own targets. Separate from me making climate-conscious choices (which frankly I believe has little impact), perhaps the bigger leverage decision is where we choose to relocate our family.\n\nI asked myself what will the planet look like 50+ years from now, and could there be \"goldilocks zones\" where the climate there will be stable for many years to come. Ideally this isn't an area where I need to personally live off the land, but instead large cities/communities that are protected. Separately, it may make for a good investment as well, but my primary focus is where to raise our family for the years to come.\n\nHas anyone else been thinking about this problem or put some work into it? I took a stab at it some months ago, trying to piece together different climate projections of the future across factors that I felt were the most risky (heat, wildfire, drought, flooding, etc.) I attempted combine these risks into a single score/grade and then map this grade across the continental USA. Here's what it looks like [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTIoXDtlYWEx4xhFIs9CIkaFX9i3vbjB/view?usp=share\\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTIoXDtlYWEx4xhFIs9CIkaFX9i3vbjB/view?usp=share_link)\n\nWhat surprised me is how much more protected northern USA is over the south. However, I also found there to be \"pockets\" (e.g. in central USA) where it's a low-risk area shield around high-risk regions.\n\nI'd be interested to further discuss this line of thinking with people here, and share findings with each other.",
