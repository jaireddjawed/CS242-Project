I felt like I hadn’t studied enough for N4, as I was studying while managing a full time job. After the July 2022 exam I decided to not study further for a while and just keep revising what I’ve already learned, since I had to learn programming, work full time and work on my college applications. But I was not able to give enough time to revise and now I feel like I’m forgetting things. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions? How do I get back on track and how do I start revising and testing myself on Japanese?",

I just reached level 4, so still very much early days. It's been so much fun so far; even being able to pick out random kanji on restaurant signs or in other contexts is delightful even as it's also a galaxy away from actual comprehension.\n\nI was wondering when and how others would integrate grammar into this process. I've downloaded Bunpro but haven't yet tried it -- in theory I like that it seems to utilize a similar SRS review system to WaniKani's, and also integrates into the latter's API (not sure how useful that'll be in practice but it's nice to imagine that they're complementary).\n\nOther thoughts/recommendations on timing or approaches to beginner grammar at this point? Should I get deeper into kanji and vocab before starting down that path?",

I'm just really bad at learning languages, and I have ADHD which makes it so much worse. I even stopped going to my local Japanese school because I was always so bored there. The main problem is, I love the language. I like to sing Japanese songs, and would love to speak it, but I hate the process so much. It's basically impossible for me to learn the language. Even if I were to learn spanish, a much easier language for english speakers, I would still suck at it (also I don't like spanish).\n\nIs there any way I can make it less overwhelming for me? I feel really bad for not actually spending the time in my friends language, despite all the physical and online resources I've got. It might also be my mental health, but that doesn't explain then why I can practice singing but not Japanese. Help is really appreciated.",

I figured why ask “where is the konbini?” if you can’t understand the response.\n\nLockdown in Australia was pretty strict, so 2 years ago I decided to make use of all that free time and learn the language.\n\nI study everyday - completed Genki1 and II, Wanikani (level36) , Bunpro (halfway through N3 grammar) and I have 3 Italki lessons a week plus the usual immersion (podcasts mainly). So, I would say I am a solid N4.\n\nI have read a few posts of people at my level arriving here and being surprised (disappointed) at how difficult it was to communicate so I was prepared. Also, there was some extra pressure from my partner, who figured after 2 years I must be ペラペラ。\n\nMy partner will talk to anyone, anywhere so over the years we made Japanese friends that we see each trip or when they visit Australia.\n\nAnd this is the point of my post. \n\nIf your interactions are limited to hospitality/service staff – it's going to be tough. They have set phrases they say so often they are just a blur and full of keigo. \n\nOn the other hand, catching up with our friends has been a great experience. The conversations have been a mixture of Japanese, English and reaching for Google translate. I honestly felt that all that study time paid off and made travelling here a richer experience.\n\nIf I was only talking to retail staff, it would be very, very discouraging.\n\nTwo other observations. Seeing Kanji “in the wild” is way different to seeing it in a text book as there are so many crazy fonts. Second, Katakana is everywhere, so don’t be like me and let it slip.",

        "text": "I have been learning Japanese as a hobby for almost 2 years. Personally, I think did pretty well as someone who self-taught Japanese only using online resources.  Currently taking a break from learning grammar(N2~N1) that I've been doing for the past few months, now I'm just immersing myself in Japanese content, and deciding what to do next. \n\n  Recently, a question stuck with me, just how much have I learned these two years? Obviously I've master hiragana/katakana, didn't have any problems with Kanji(since I came from the country that uses it).  I memorize as much as vocabs as I can by  constantly adding words to my anki deck. I understand decent amount of grammars through me grinding to learn all grammar as much possible (N5~N1)  I did all this for about 1.5 years and starting to be able to consume Japanese content without too much problems. I can understand the content around 80%( except for joke references of sorts) while still enjoy it and learn some new vocabs, proverbs, new sentence structures along the way. Whenever I watch or read something and I always have that moment of \" Wait, I know it cuz I learned this grammar/vocabs from X days ago!\" \n\nOf course it doesn't always go that well, depends on the topic and the difficulty of the subject, my understanding might go down to 40% or less. And that's where I realized my Japanese probably isn't good enough. From the very beginning I understood that mastering a language is not a simple task, and it's gonna take a long time. But all my hard work that resulted me starting to understand Japanese gives a big confidence boost, I thought I \"understand\" the language, until I hit that wall. I pondered, did I just not get enough study?  Do I need to study more to get to that point? And just how much have I learned these two years? Where exactly is my Japanese level at? What can I do and what should I do next? \n\n\n So I researched and found out apparently there are people who take JLPT to test their Japanese, and can get an actual certification for passing them and putting on resume. But this isn't for me, because as I said I'm only learning Japanese as a hobby, in the future I have no plan to study or work in Japan. (That being said ofc its good to have something on your resume, but for now I don't need it.) As for another reason for it, I didn't want to spend any money or at least minimize it if possible, since I heard it's not free to take the exam. So I wonder if there's other way to test my Japanese through online accurately without needing to spend any single cent as well.\nIn my own evaluation (estimate) , I think my Japanese level is around N3~N2 and weaker at listening and speaking side. But it's just my own evaluation after all, it can't be 100% correct. Or rather I do not have they qualification to do so. Which is why I need some else to test my Japanese level like doing exam in JLPT. \n\nIf you know any, please give me some recommendations website or something that would be helpful for me to know where my Japanese level at. Any suggestions for how I should continue my Japanese study are also welcomed!",

I'm visiting Japan later this year for 6 weeks and aim to return sometime in 2024 to commence study. So I'll be 50 by the time I commence studies.\n\nMy personal situation insofar as may be relevant: \n\n\\- I'm a semi-retired solicitor based in Western Australia\n\n\\- I'm financially secure &amp; have no plans to work while studying in Japan or to use my Japanese language skills to work in Japan in the future (although if I decided on a more permanent move to Japan, I would be interested in teaching English both to enrich my own experience and to 'give back')  \n\n\\- I currently have no Japanese language skills and so am looking for a course which kicks off at absolute beginner level, although I intend to learn the kanas &amp; do a preparatory/beginner course prior to commencing study in Japan\n\n\\- I am interested in applying for a course of 1 - 2 years' duration\n\n\\- I am open to studying in any city. That said, studying in/near Kyoto really appeals to me\n\n\\- I think I would prefer a 'medium' learning intensity course given I would ideally like to have plenty of free time to do other stuff. However I am not averse to putting in the hours to make the most of the learning experience\n\n\\- I am unsure what style of accommodation would be most suitable. Although I am an older guy, I would say that I am 'young at heart' and would prefer to live in a social setting or at least one with plenty of opportunities to socialise and meet locals and other students outside of class\n\nAny advice regarding schools, locations, accommodation, any required or recommended learning prior to commencing study, tips &amp; tricks and favourable or unfavourable experiences is welcomed. I would love to hear from younger &amp; older students. I had a nice laugh reading one of the language school sites which described 30 year old students as \"middle aged\" haha.\n\nThank you very much :)",

In the month that I’ve been studying everyday for multiple hours a day, though, Teppei sensei is the best thing that I have come across. It is incredible how the cards I learn in anki even just the night before I will hear in his 3 minute conversations the next day. I know he’s pretty well regarded, but genuinely nothing has reinforced my confidence in learning Japanese as much as his beginner podcast. If I ever get down or distressed from feeling like I’m moving too slow or doing something wrong, listening to his podcast and being able to understand 60-80% of what he is saying reinforces my confidence so much. I’m looking forward to being able to understand him 100% and I’m sure that day will come relatively soon. Just a great overall resource and very fun listen everytime. I love how encouraging he is, always saying to do your best.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10lndva/the_starter_guide_needs_to_be_rewritten/",
        "text": "So I've been pretty much lurking quietly for the past 5 months or so and one of the most common posts I see is from beginners asking where to go/what to do next etc, the posts are usually quickly deleted with users and mods telling them to read the starter guide.\n\nThe problem is, I don't think the guide is fit for purpose. At just under 2000 words, it's a nicely written piece explaining what Japanese is etc but there is no clear cut guide on what to do ie \"do this, do that and then this\" etc. Instead of having a clear outline on what needs to be done, the best it does it link a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/fohull/a_year_to_learn_japanese_reflections_on_five/) by  [/u/Suikacider](https://old.reddit.com/u/Suikacider) , the guide feels like it was written for people who accidentally stumbled on Japanese (having no clue what Japanese is) instead of people who have actively came here to learn it.\n\nAfter 856ish words we get to Getting Started, at this point the guide improves (as it actually does begin telling you how to learn Japanese) but I think it still has a lot of room for improvement. This part feels really \"advisory\" instead of telling you what to do which I feel misses the intended aim of a guide.\n\nPersonally I think the guide should be flipped upside down, the important information should be at the top, an easy to understand study guide should be at the top and questions such as \"how long will it take to learn japanese\" or history related information should be at the bottom, ie, the first thing users should see is the guide when they open the page.\n\nHow I think the guide should be written:\n\nA brief explanation about the learning tools that are widely used that have lead to a high level of success in learning Japanese and probably the most important part, how we learn. As a firm believe of anki, I would put this first. We learn by repetition and that's what anki does, it's basically testing us everyday which helps us remember.\n\nHow to learn Japanese\n\nStep 1. Learn Hiragana and Katakana\n\nStep 2. Learn Words\n\nStep 3. Learn Grammar\n\nStep 4. Try and use level appropriate media\n\nStep 5. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.\n\nFor me that's the simple guide that I feel that everyone really needs to hear that the guide just doesn't touch on. After step 5. It should explain how to go about each of the steps.\n\nIe\n\nStep 1. Learn Hiragana and Katakana\n\nThese are basically the Japanese Alphabet, they have the exact same pronunciations, the only difference is that katakana is used with specific words ie; words borrowed from other languages  テーブル - te - buru - From English \"Table\" whilst the vast majority of words are made up from Hiragana.\n\nAs a a learner of Japanese, you need to learn both of these, the recommended methods for learning them are x . x . x .x etc.\n\nStep 2. Learn Words\n\nThe next step is learning words, in order to read, speak, listen, express yourself, you're going to need to know the words of the Japanese language to do any of these. Use x . x . x . x methods etc for learning new words.\n\nStep 3. Learn Grammar\n\nI think you see where this is going. If words are essentially the brickwork of a language then Grammar is the mortar which holds it altogether use x . x . x . resource.\n\nStep 4. Try and use level appropriate media\n\nLearning words and Grammar in isolation is ok to start with but in order to truly get used to the language, it's important to try and read/use native material. Knowing all the words and Grammar within a sentence won't make the meaning immediately obvious to you and will take some time, only through using the language will you develop the skills necessary  in order to understand content quickly. x . x .x .x . x - Obviously there are many methods on how people can acquire material but there is a lot of free material that has been posted to reddit over the years, I'd put these resources here.\n\nStep 5. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.\n\nThat's it. That's the secret to learning Japanese, learn words, learn grammar and continue to reinforce and expand your ability to understand Japanese. As long as you follow these 5 steps, put the time and effort in, there is no reason your Japanese shouldn't improve.\n\nAnd that's basically it, that's what I think the core guide should look like, a very simple and easy to understand guide.\n\nAfter the basic explanation I would have a list of the most common resources and the pro's and cons for them. The pro's and cons of Genki 1 and 2 for me are they teach basic vocab and beginner appropriate grammar but unless you have a teacher and the answer book, most of the content is useless to someone who's self studying.\n\nThat's it basically, I feel that that's how the guide should be structured, to me it looks like an actual guide of \"do this, then this, then that\" \"Learn kana, learn words, learn grammar, rise and repeat\".\n\nThis may come across as a personal attack - it really isn't the intent, it really is a nicely written piece but as a study guide it really needs improvement.\n\nThoughts and feedback are more than welcome.",

Like I see dual-spelling (i.e. kanji+romaji) and even triple spelling like on trains (Kanji+hiragana+romaji)  all over Japan so I know you have to be exposed to it. Maybe natives learn to ignore the romaji so they really don't get experience using it, thus it's hard to understand when words are romaji alone?\n\nOr is the word recognition process different for Japanese natives, like would it be equally difficult to read the menu if it was only in hiragana?",

        "text": "Hey everyone I've been lurking on this subreddit for quite a bit! I'm currently struggling a bit and wanting some advice.\n\nI've been studying Japanese for about one and a half years. In college I took three semesters of Japanese and I'm probably borderline N4 level (about to finish Genki 2). I recently just arrived in Japan as a part of a study abroad program, and quite honestly, I'm getting very discouraged about the language. \n\nI see tons of comments online about people achieving conversational fluency after merely 1-2 years of Japanese studying, or becoming fluent after only living in Japan for a few months. However, despite being here for a few weeks, I find myself utterly lost. I feel like every social interaction is difficult. Additionally, it seems like almost every one on my study abroad program is so much better than me.\n\nOften people say that you should speak to Japanese people to improve, but if I'm at a restaurant, I often can not figure out one word of what the waiter is saying. Furthermore, if I'm talking with a Japanese friend and they start speaking Japanese, I am usually completely unable to follow along. I just feel super discouraged, and am honestly wondering if language acquisition is not for me and if I should give up. I feel like I'm constantly making a fool of myself in Japan, and whenever I go somewhere, I'm a burden. My listening ability is definitely my weakest skill, although my grammar, vocab, and speaking are nothing impressive either...\n\nHas anyone else have had feelings like this? Did you manage to push through it? I'm wondering if choosing to study abroad in Japan was too ambitious of a decision.",

It's making learning the verbs really challenging. \n\nFor example, today I learned そそのかす and 装う. Both are relatively long words with complex meanings, and i would expect them to be derived from other, simpler words, but i haven't found any easily accessible information about this.",

I do watch anime but I haven’t made the transition to Japanese subtitles yet as I would not get much out of that at this point. In the vocabulary that I have been learning, some of the words stick and some of them don’t, as is the same for most people when they are learning. I decided to find a podcast today that just has a person reading words in English then their Japanese translations. Is this bad or good? I haven’t seen many people mention this as a method before, but the job I work I am able to have headphones in for the entire shift so I can just listen to podcasts like Nihongo con Teppei, which I really enjoy, and this vocab podcast. Is this a method worth doing or do I just keep listening to Japanese podcasts even though I don’t understand everything yet but get the general idea of what he is talking about?",
