        "text": "Recently, I've unfortunately encountered two types of people that seem unable to use a soup spoon.\n\nOne type is the slurper.  Correct use of the spoon right up to the point that the liquid goes into the mouth.  They then feel the need to use vacuum force to suck the soup the rest of the way. Noisily.\n\nThe second avoids the need for Dyson-like suction by ramming the too-wide utensil into their mouth, usually clattering their teeth on the way.\n\nI should add that these are mature adults that I'm talking about.",

Experience our curated, pre-organized night out where we rent out a whole bar/club to make sure that you don't have to interact with anyone outside of our bubble! Explore the city on our free bikes (but make sure you don't cycle outside the geofence)! Get drunk in our built-in bar (but don't forget that it closes at 11 and we won't serve you if you seem tipsy)! Enjoy your studio apartment with a king-sized bed (but don't forget to fill in the mountain of paperwork if you want your girlfriend to stay with you)!\n\nIs nothing allowed to be authentic and natural anymore?",

Arguably the last place people could actually make use of this right for wild camping was Dartmoor. Now that's being restricted by a single greedy landowner (who owns acres upon acres of land in Dartmoor) who's gone to court because the word \"wild-camping\" wasn't used in the original document and that means wild-camping isn't outdoor recreation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKids going on wild-camping trips, Duke of Edinburgh Awards, Scouts- these have all been effected. Before you know it, the same warped logic will begin to be applied to many other recreational activities till outdoor common land is basically privatised like everything else in this country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy, Mr Darwall, said wild-campers might cause ecological destruction as his defence- (even though rules of 'leave-no-trace exists very commonly', then went ahead and released his pheasants on an endangered protected species of beetle, send £5000 to the local MP of a neighbouring area, who then went on the vote for dumping raw sewage into the water, then got Dartmoor national park (which is funded by taxpayers) to pay him in so that he can allow wild camping in some new very restricted areas. That's not to mention he was already getting subsidies from tax-payer money for just owning land.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis land should never have been sold in the first place since it's common land. But the fact that something that was free and being maintained by tax payer money- is not only restricted by costs even more now to tax payers is at risk of being lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for listening to my rant/Ted Talk",

It’s a semi-detached house in a nice area and I’ve always had this dream and desire since I was younger to own next door and my grandparents’ house and knock it through into one.\n\nThe young family who live there are also the loudest neighbours I’ve ever known in my life. A youngish couple with two kids. Don’t see much of mum, but dad is constantly drilling or hammering some sort of DIY project daily. Kids seem to like to run around on laminate flooring and even play football or something in there.\n\nSo yeah I’ve been crossing my fingers that my luck would have it and they’ll sell up soon. New home prospects and peace and quiet. \n\nNope. Looks like they’re doing some bedroom DIY project as we’ve seen them taking new flat pack wardrobes in. Two vans parked outside, one blocking our driveway, good job we’re not going out. So if they’re kitting out the bedroom I guess they’re here to stay.\n\nShame",

It was all finished up and I'd painted and all that and it was just waiting on the actual stuff getting moved in and then I could do the spare room for the kids. So I was giving it one final check before filling it with my stuff and on my way out I let out possibly one of the biggest farts I have ever done in my life. The reverb in the empty room was really quite something. It felt like something was being ripped out of me rather than pushed out by the normal process. There was a mild echo effect.\n\nThis pleased me greatly and (knob head that I happily know I am) I said to myself in the door way \"Ooooooorrrrr! Well, that's the acoustics tested!\" and began to chuckle to myself. It turns out I was not saying this to myself, and was cut dead mid-chuckle as found myself locked in an uncomfortably long 4 seconds or more (felt like forever) of silent eye contact with the lady next door who seemed to be staring open mouthed at me, pegging out washing.\n\nNow there are a lot of ways I could have handled this. Laugh it off? Make a joke of it? Maybe even apologise? Maybe even just style it out and go on with my business or look sheepish or something. But no. I did none of those things. I, a 41 year old man, went a very different route. Because (for reasons I cannot fathom) my reaction was to instead wordlessly continue to stare like a rabbit in the headlights while backing into my shed like Homer Simpson retreating into the f\\*\\*\\*ing bushes, and shut the door. And then hid for a good 5 minutes. \n\nAs I say, I am quite cordial with her husband but part of me wonders. I mean she \\*must\\* have told him, right? Occasionally when I walk past the front of their house I will see her going about her business in the kitchen window, but a sense of rising paranoia makes me wonder if she then turns to her husband and says \"He's not right, that fella\". They've been doing a lot of work on the house recently and I think they are planning to sell. I can't help but wonder if I'm part of that!",
