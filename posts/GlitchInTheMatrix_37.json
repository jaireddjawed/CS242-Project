I joked with myself that something terrible would've e happened and te clogged ear was God's way of saving me. Then, before I was about yogi for a swim in the ocean I thought maybe a time traveler version of me had clogged my ear so I wouldn't go swimming. Whatever, I thought, whatever happened will happen. I ha no idea where that thought came from and laughed it off. Sure enough I cut my foot open on what was probably some glass in te ocean about ten minutes later and had to get stitches.

        "text": "I'm a highschool student, and we've been on summer break for about a month now. During the last week of classes, I left my iPod touch on the desk in my environmental class, and when I came back to look for it it was gone. I decided I'd lost it, mourned the hours I'd worked to save up for it, and carried on with my life. \n\nLast night, I had a dream that I was looking through my backpack and there was a weird little zipper pocket inside one of the other pockets. I'd never seen this pocket before, so that tipped me off to start semi- lucid dreaming. This often happens to me, where I'm aware than I'm dreaming but I'm more of an observer. I watched as my dream-self unzipped the pocket, and inside was my iPod!\n\nThis morning when I woke up, I remembered the dream and realized that I still hadn't cleaned the old folders and papers our of my backpack. I decided to do that, and after it was empty, I noticed a weird pocket in exactly the same place as it had been in my dream. This freaked me out, but I opened it, and *my iPod was inside.* \n\nI know this sounds impossible, but I swear it just happened! I'd literally never noticed the pocket in my life, as it was towards the bottom of the bag underneath a pile of folders. Even when I first got the bag and was exploring it, I never saw the pocket. ",

First and foremost, sorry for the shitty title, I just don't know what to say. Anyways, as a back story, my parents are out of town on vacation and I was in charge of the house. Yesterday, I was out of food so I called my brother and asked if I could come stay over there and if he could lend me some money. He said that was okay, and about an hour later he picked me up from my house. We get back to his house and sit in the back room. \n\n\nThe house is set up where the only way to get to the back room you have to go past the front room into the kitchen and there's a doorway that leads to the room. Anyways, I get a text from my girlfriend asking if I want to come to her grandma's for a little bit, so I agree. Anyways, about 45 minutes pass and there is still no sign of her. I texted her asking where she was, and as soon as I was about to press send I got a text from her saying something like \"fucking call me back\". Mind you, I hadn't received any texts or calls throughout the whole time.\n\n\n I walk outside and call her and explain everything, his house is kind of in the middle of nowhere so I may have just not had the signal. She pulls back up, and tells me she had texted and called me multiple times. The next thing she said chilled me to the bone.\n\n\n She told me that she walked up to the door and knocked on 3 separate occasions, each louder and louder. After that didn't work, she rang the doorbell (which would have echoed through the whole house, I tested it later on). The weird thing is, none of us heard anything at all. What may have happened?",

        "text": "So this is a weird one. So a couple months ago I usually fall asleep with my phone/wallet next to me. I have one of those leather phone cases that doubles as a wallet. Anyways, as I put down the phone on the table next to me, I didn't had it on the table good enough and it actually fell. I heard all the cards drop and I was just too tired to deal with it so I just grabbed whatever was in the ground and put it in a small pile thinking i'd just organize them tomorrow. Anyways tomorrow came and I noticed I was missing 3 cards, my License, Debit card and a credit card. I hundred percent knew I had my debit card in there and license because I just went to walmart and used it and also used it to buy some online gold for a ipad game. I searched all over my room, under the bed. in the covers, inside pillow cases.. I was a bit pissed because I just ordered a PS4 off of amazon now I won't be able to purchase any games. So i rationalized, I called walmart to see if they found anything.. they said they don't have it  (I was skeptical) I checked all over the other rooms but nothing.. So after a few days of looking i gave up.. So I ordered a new debit, license and credit card. the next day, I woke up in my bed and noticed something inside the pillow case (which I thoroughly searched the other day.) and there they were, all three of them. magically appearing.. I was toying the notion that they dropped into a different dimension before i actually found them. And I'm almost certain they probably did. I have another experience but i'll leave that for another post. thanks for reading.",

She told him to pull over, which he did. She then grabbed a pen and a piece of paper and drew a map, and told my dad to follow it, and that there would be an old church that she wanted to see. She even described it.  My dad, being a no bullshit kind of guy (he was a highly disciplined fighter pilot, still is very much conservative in his thoughts, actions and words), thought she was nuts! But he figured he'd go along with her map. Sure enough, after a serious of turns, the church appeared exactly where she said it would be. My dad has confirmed this story, which is why I have no issues with believing it.",

        "text": "When I was in college - so I would have been between the ages of 16 and 18 - my boyfriend and I had a strange experience on the bus home. We were sitting there and the bus was very busy. We had a seat but some people were standing up. It was a rickety, ancient thing notorious for leaking, growing mould and breaking down all the time. It was daylight still, and as we were sitting there, I started to hear something underneath all the loud teenage chatter. It was an electronic sound, like a garbled metallic kind of speech. Like someone was speaking in a classic 'robot voice' and then it had been scrambled. There were no recognisable words and it sounded... fast. Speeded up. \n\nI looked at my boyfriend and asked, \"Can you hear that?\"\n\nHe said, \"The robot voice?\"\n\nNo one else on the bus reacted to it at all. They just kept chattering away. I would tune it out, so to speak, but just a second of concentration and I could hear it again. This went on a for a few minutes. Weirdly, the two of us didn't talk about it much more at the time so far as I recall.\n\nThis would have been between 2006 and 2008, so while it's not outside the realms of possibility that it was a recording or a fault with somebody's phone, this was before smartphones and it seems unlikely to me. No one was giggling or pranking us, and no one else seemed to hear it.\n\nI asked the boyfriend - now my ex and close friend - the other day if he remembered it, when I was thinking about posting here. He does. \nI heard something similar to that voice again, years later, and was instantly reminded of it. I told that story over at /r/thetruthishere : http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/28nubm/all_about_malcolm/\n",

Sadly this triggered alzheimers and she died when I was 12 after suffering for three years. More recently (and less important), I had a dream that I woke up to my mom coming back from the supermarket and telling me that she bought six cartons of blueberries. In the dream, I looked into the fridge and saw the blueberries. I woke up after the dream, and fell back asleep without dreaming for the rest of the night. As soon as I woke up in the morning, I walked out into the hallway of my house and was greeted by my mom, who told me that she had bought six cartons of blueberries. I looked into the bridge and the blueberries were in the exact same place as in my dream.",

I tell him I have to use the restroom and he waves me away. \n\nTake care of business, step out, and K is waiting for me and looking a bit impatient. We're ready to get out of the store at this point, so we head back to the aisle where we saw the fries in the first place...and they weren't there.\n\nIt was like some really masterful photoshop had taken place in the Frozen Foods aisle - where there had previously been bags upon bags of frozen potatoes, the entire 'Potatoes' section, right down to the sign, had vanished. K agreed that we had passed it before, and thinking we'd gone to the wrong aisle, we try venturing around the store again...french fries are still nowhere to be found. \n\nK and I are both a little bothered at this point - we passed them, for sure, in this aisle! K remembered because of the displays on the floor that remarked about great discounts. I tell K that I'm going to go find an employee and to wait there, and he does. The employee points me in the direction of the French Fries but I ask him to take me there. I needed to know if K and I were the only ones affected by this weird potato-less reality.\n\nThe employee brings me to the aisle, and lo and behold: bags upon bags of frozen potatoes, just like before. K is standing there, and he asks where I went. I tell him that I went to find an employee since we couldn't find the fries, and K just stares at me and tells me he'd been waiting for me by the fries since I'd gone to the restroom.\n\nTl;dr - Went to the bathroom and ended up in a world without French Fries or other frozen potato products. Got a store employee, ended up  back in my own world. Now that's what I call customer service.",

As most healthy kids that age I was a horn-dog, and would fantasize about girls and sex a lot, but I had never gone beyond first base in real life.  In fact; I hadn't even gone beyond first base in my dreams. I had heard about \"wet dreams\" but had never really experienced one. (Probably because I would masturbate several times a day, so by the time I went to sleep I'd already be \"emptied\")\nAnyways, this night I did in fact experience a wet and amazingly detailed and vivid dream. In th dream I was lying in a big safety net looking up at two beautiful asian trapeze artists soaring through the air above me. I remember getting really exited looking at these exotic girls in their tight sparkling uniforms.  One of them fell and landed beside me in the net. She smiled at me. I kissed her. I started taking off her uniform and kissing her neck. It was so real. I could smell her and taste her. Her small breasts were bare now, and I started kissing and sucking on them. I could feel her nipples getting hard in my mouth as I let my tongue play with them. I took of the rest of her clothes and moved on down between her legs. My face was just inches from her sex. I could feel the moisture and warmth radiate from her pussy. The smell was so enticing. I started licking her, and I loved it. The taste was so real. So new. So different. Like nothing I had ever tasted before. \"So this is what a woman tastes like?\" I thought to myself. Then I woke up. The taste was still in my mouth. I would never forget.\nA couple of years later I got the chance to do the deed for real. As I got her panties of and the aroma of her sex hit my nostrils I remembered the dream. This was oddly familiar.  My tongue touched her lips and dugg into her wet pussy, and I swear to all that is holy: The taste was just the same as I remembered from the dream! How did innocent, unexperienced and virgin 13 year old me already know what a woman tastes like!?\n",

        "text": "When I was young (before I hit my teens I think) I used to have these dreams that seemed ordinary at the time, and I would forget about them. Then several years down the line I would enter a room for the first time and be hit with an incredible sense of Déjà vu. I'm not talking the type where you think you've seen something out of the corner of your eye once before.. I mean like \"I've been in this exact situation, with these exact people, and these exact sounds, thinking this exact same thing.\" and these episodes would usually last until i either left the room or was focused on something else.\n\nThe most prevalent I can think of is when I was around 13 I was going on a bus trip with my school from New Brunswick to Quebec, and the moment I sat down I was hit with one of these episodes from a dream I had from I was around 6, while I lived in Saskatchewan. I remembered the dream so vividly because I was standing up, looking at the bus full of kids, and then I sat down, turned across the isle to my \"girlfriend\" and I opened my mouth about to say something about remembering this, then closed my mouth because I remembered remembering it. The feeling lasted the entire bus trip. \n\nNothing really significant has happened since entering adulthood that I can recall off hand but I'm curious if others have experienced something like. I'm also open to suggestions to explain it rationally, but because of how detailed and realistic the memory of the dream was, I'm almost entirely sure it wasn't a false memory.",

So when I was 13, we were going to move houses for the first time. And one morning I woke up like usual and when I opened my closet door to get dressed, everything was missing. But then I figured, \"oh probably my dad already took my stuff out and packaged it since we were in a period of moving\". So then I just got dressed with the few clothes I had that were not in the closet and the day continued like normal. Then by night time, I had completely forgotten about the closet. So I opened its doors to get my sleepwear, and everything was back in place, I had nothing missing at all. I put my pajamas on then I went to sleep. Then the next morning I realized what had happened and I even asked my parents if they had moved my stuff but both of them said no. And I would not expect them to pull a prank on me like that since they were both very serious and strict. To this day I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what happened. ",

I first heard about it on [here, #7] (http://listverse.com/2014/05/05/10-creepy-tales-of-interdimensional-travel/). \n\nWithout having you read the article I'll sum it up. Carol Chase McElheney was traveling from Perris to San Bernardino (for those of you unfamiliar with this area here in Southern California, it's called the Inland Empire) and she decided to stop in Riverside (it is between Perris and San Bernardino for those of you not familiar with this area). She realized she couldn't remember where her childhood home was and also noticed that everything looked creepy, even the people on the street. She thought maybe she was in the wrong town but then she recognized the cemetery and UC Riverside... even though they were dilapidated now.\n\nShe was freaked out and decided to not stay there anymore and continued driving back home. A few years after this she returned to Riverside for her dad's funeral and the city was the same as she knew it. She thought maybe she'd entered a parallel dimension where Riverside was a shittier town than it already is.",

And I then felt the same, sucking feeling, moving forward, except this time, it was accompanied by bright flashing and an absolutely unbearable headache. When I looked up again, it was my housecleaner, not my sister. When I asked her about it she just laughed as well.\n\n\n3# It happened again, I was drawing a picture in class, or a doodle, whatever, but I felt the sucking feeling, plus the splitting headache, and I ended up with a blank piece of paper.",

I was leaving my bedroom when I heard the dogs start barking like they usually do when someone pulls up the driveway. I listened for a moment and eventually heard the front door open and close. I heard my dad say from the kitchen (at this moment I was unable to see into there) \"Hi sweetie, I'm home.\" So I called back, \"Hi dad, how was work?\" When I got no reply I walked to the kitchen and saw he was not there and his truck was not parked in the driveway. Freaking out I started back to my room, once I got to my door again, I heard the dogs start barking, the front door open and shut, and then I heard my dad say, \"Hi sweetie, I'm home.\" I ran into the kitchen and there he was, I was obviously freaked out but I didn't explain what had just happened. This was the first incident.\n\n2.This one was even creepier and it happened to my entire family. We were driving to a Costco, which was about 2 hours away. It was a normal drive, we just talked about school, work, life, the usual. Suddenly we heard a song start playing. I can't remember the song but it had a very unique opening which lasted about 30 seconds (it wasn't actual singing just raspy talking and different noises). The song played just till the opening ended and then it just went silent. My mother suddenly exclaimed, \"What the hell just happened?! Did you guys hear that too?!\" We all responded with a quick yes. All of the phones were muted (they also didn't have that particular song on them), there was only one MP3 player but it had no batteries in it, and the radio was broken! So there was nothing in that car that could have played that song. To make things creepier, when we were heading home my dad put some new batteries (that we bought at Costco) into the MP3 player and the same exact song started right away.\n\nI hope you liked my stories, I have a couple more if you guys want to hear them.",

At the beginning of practice, we were turning in pieces of music out of the books (a book is a collection of music that a player holds) as we had recently gotten new music and we had too many pieces in our books. We had a table set up where everyone was to come over and lay their part in it's given pile. Someone put a piece that a couple players don't like, \"Sometimes I feel Like A Motherless Child\", in a new pile as a joke to our bandleader Renee. I saw it and knew what the other guys were trying to pull so I didn't bother to put my part in the pile. Later, when Renee comes over to pick up the pieces, she sees the pile and we all share a laugh as everyone tries to deny doing it. This is where things get weird. \n\nShe starts passing \"Sometimes...\" back out and she walks over to me and hands me my bass part. I do a double take. I hadn't put mine in the pile. I try to tell her this and she thinks I am confused and hadn't realized that we weren't supposed to turn that piece in. I turn to my book and get my copy out. I sat there and held to copies of my part. As the only bass player, no one else should have had a bass part. Furthermore, both of them were originals, not copies, which means that someone could not have made a copy of my part, but that one would have had to have been ordered from the publisher, which Renee said she never did. Lastly, no one admitted to putting it up there. I welcome any explanation.   ",

        "text": "Alright, let me preface this that there was alcohol involved, but still there was a glitch. \n\nMy best friend came to visit me in California from Wisconsin and I took him out in San Diego to show him a good time. We got off the train and met another friend at his apartment, got changed and proceeded to go out to dinner and then bar hop. The day before, i bought a brand new hat that I was wearing out that night. The night proceeded to get drunk and we ended up at this club. This is the last time we were all together. \n\nAll 3 of us separately left the club by ourselves. My friend i came with, drove around in a cab for an hour and eventually found his apartment. My friend who lived there, got taken home by a girl he knew, because he was too drunk. I walked, but when I got to his apartment, i didn't remember which unit was his and proceeded to knock on random doors. Now its around 3 am, so this was a bad idea. One guy came rushing to his door with a golf club and chased me out of the apartment complex as if I were some homeless guy trying to break in. \nSo now I'm just out on the street and I realized I don't have my phone, or my hat! I have no clue what I'm going to do, but i'm really pissed I lost that hat. I ended up wandering around until a nearby bar opened at 6am, used their phone and tried to wake up my friends that I hoped were at his place. \n\nThey finally answer and I get back to their apartment and pass out. When I wake up, my friend suggest we go get some breakfast. He says \"Oh i forgot to mention, i got a new car, wait till you see this!\" He takes us to the parking lot, which we never went to the night before and there is a brand new Lexus. He unlocks the car, I get inside, and on the back seat, is my HAT! I have never seen or been in this car before. \n\nI would have had no idea, even at my drunkest point that this was his car, since he didn't even tell us till that morning that he got it AND the car was locked.  \n\nI have no idea how my hat, was in his car.

I'm trying not to break down and start sobbing in a ball.\nI've never had a history of mental illness, I've always been smart with no issues at all in my life. \nI was referred here by a friend a few months ago because he said some weird crap happens to others that I'd never even talk about usually, now he isn't answering his phone or responding to texts. This site was written on piece of paper that I found in my pocket.\nSo it all started a few hours ago. I woke up from a nap and all of a sudden I hear a loud bang coming from the kitchen. I go to see what the noise is and there's a random woman standing in the kitchen while making spinach. That's odd I think. Must be one of my mom's friends I don't know or something... So I ask who she is and she responds \"Oh stop playing around, honey and help me make dinner before you brother gets home from school.\" So I'm like what? \"Why did you call me honey? Who the hell are you?\" She gives me a strange puzzled look. \"Honey seriously help me cook this spinach and stop joking around.\" At this point I feel like I'm being punked and Ashton Kutcher is about to pop out from under the kitchen table and scream in my face. I start to panic. Am I dreaming? What's going on? No, this must be a joke or something. \"Uh... I don't know who you are, but please stop. It's not funny. Where is my mom?\" She looks at me like I'm insane now. \"Are you feeling okay, Jaden? Did you eat some bad tuna or something?\" I look down at my feet. Okay, I'm dreaming this can't be real. I'm not crazy. What is going on? I'm so freaking scared right now. \"WHERE IS MY FREAKING MOTHER?\" I yell at this woman. She steps back with a scared expression on her face. \"Hun, you're starting to scare me, are you feeling okay?\" I look at her with a weird confused gaze. I can't process anything now. It's gotta be a joke.. What is going on. I have a brilliant idea. I run to the living room and grab the family portrait... but then as I slam it on the kitchen table.. I notice something that made me wanna scream as loud as my lungs could handle. The picture clearly showed this unknown woman in the place where my mom was before in the picture. I knew that my mom used to be there. What the fuck is going on now? I can't be crazy. Everything was fine before I fell asleep for a quick nap. Why is this happening? I yell to the kitchen \"Please this isn't funny! Where's my mom?\" Silence. \"Sweetheart, why are you acting like this? Please stop. Do I need to call a doctor?\" And then I get frightened. I hear a phone dialing coming from the kitchen. I hear her mutter a few words into the phone as she glances into my bedroom with a worried expression. I then start to shake slightly and I try to call a friend or to look for files on my computer for proof of what my mom looks like with no success. All my photos on my computer are gone. My friends wont answer their phones or text me back. My brother is still at school. I'm confused and scared. I start to hear my mom say that someone is going to help me really soon. I know that if I don't leave that I'll be sent away and screwed forever. I can't be sent to an institute. I am not crazy! I know that. I've always had good grades. I've always been a smart, average kid who enjoys rap music with the same family and same friends. I gotta go now. I see her take the cordless phone into her bedroom and I book out of the house and grab my bike and start biking fast down to the library. Luckily I don't see this woman chase me so either she didnt hear me or expects me to be back. Maybe she'll send police after me now that I'm gone. I don't know what to do. I want my mom back. I want my life back. I'm sitting a library with a different hoodie over my face and I'm trying not to be noticed. I came to this subreddit because of the referral and I hope that you can help me. I dont usually post but maybe someone here has experienced this and can give me advice. I have nobody else to turn to or anyone that would believe me without thinking im purely crazy. And It's pretty busy in here and I can't stop shaking. I'm sure I look suspicious. What do I do? I've never been so confused in my life. I'm shocked and scared. Also, what I'm saying is 100 percent factual. I have no reason to lie to others on the internet. I just want things to be back to normal. I've never been so afraid. Please help me, someone. Anyone. What do I do? I know I'm not crazy. I don't have skitzaphrenia or bipolar or anything. I've never taken meds. Has anyone else experienced this before? Help me please!",

Syntax Error.\n\nAnyway, I remembered about 8 years ago, myself and a group of friends entered an abandoned building in our town. It was a big hall where events would take place. So we climbed through the window into a small room, and to get into the main hall we had to move this huge oak table that was blocking the door shut. It took 4 of the boys to move it, which made a horribly loud screeching noise. We were all about 16 at the time so we weren't inexplicably weak, it was just a heavy ass table. We spent a good couple of hours there, smoking, (not drugs.. so none if us were impaired) playing ball and what not. Then when we went to leave, through the same door we entered, I pushed the door only for it to come to a halt and a thud as it hit this massive oak table. The door was open enough that I could see through the gap to know the table was back in the way of the door. At this point I freaked out. I thought it was ghosts...yes, I honestly thought ghosts. I got scared and ran out of the front door, which could only be opened from the inside. There was no way in he'll that anybody would have even come into the building without us hearing them, let alone move that bastard table. \n\nI'm not looking for upvotes, as this isn't my main. I'm just wondering if any of you thinkers could shed some light on something that I, nor any of the groovy gang could. Besides ghosts.",

She was talking about her children, we were standing at the playground. And suddenly, word for word, the whole conversation became deja vu, and it just kept going and going while I tried to act nonchalant so she wouldn't think I was crazy. I knew it was really from a dream I had because I remember having it months ago, waking up, and talking to my husband about what a weird dream I was having and wondering why I would have a dream like that. Just an everyday conversation, couldn't see the person's face. Well, turns out that was because I was avoiding eye contact, trying not to look crazy! The only deja vu I've ever had that had any chance of being even slightly not-pointless was one where I dreamed that my husband stepped on some baked goods while we were at a parade. Months later, we're at a parade, his foot is really close to a plate of baked goods, I got deja vu and decided to move the plate. Only, he complained that he definitely was not going to step on it. Now we'll never know because I prevented it from even possibly happening. \nI'm a big believer that all strange things have some scientific explanation even if we haven't figured it out yet, but this deja vu is really throwing me for a loop. How can anything be known beforehand?? And why something so mundane? ",

Like a light sleep, starting to drift off.\nSuddenly, it was like I could see everything in my room, even though my eyes were closed. But the way I was seeing the room wasn't normal. It's hard to describe, but basically, it was like I was seeing in a way where the room looked like one of those computer programs used to design houses. Everything was black except for the objects, such as the door, bed, tables, tv, etc, was outlined in green. The lines were sort of moving too, like the outline of the door was sort of a scrolling green line, line dotted with green. \nAnyway, in this weird state, I see my roommate come in, we have a short conversation about playing Madden. Like basically just a normal conversation, like 'hey, are you napping? wanna play some Madden?' and a few back and forth things I can't remember right now. \nThen, I wake up hearing my roommate come in through the front door, walk up the stairs, and come into my room. By this point, I'm no longer sleeping or in a dream like state. He comes into my room, and we have that same exact, like totally exact, conversation about playing Madden, same phrasing, pacing, and everything. It only lasted maybe a minute, but for that minute, it was like I was acting out what I just saw, to a tee. I never mentioned it to anyone because it sounds crazy. For a minute, I knew exactly what was going to happen. I have no idea what to think of this, because it happened with such a mundane event, but ever since, I feel like this opened my eyes to knowing that crazy things are possible that we can't understand yet.

So there is normally no confusion to where I park. I have a nice routine going. Yesterday was no different.\n\nLast night, I worked a little late (7pm), and walked to the parking garage. As always, I walked up to the 3rd floor and immediately noticed my car was gone. I saw the familiar cars I saw when parking that morning, but mine wasn't there. Fearing the worst, I panicked. Frantically pressing the lock button on my key fob, I heard my horn. It was faint; like it was coming from a different floor. So I followed the sound and it never seemed to get louder. The sound took me up to the next floor on a different section and then completely stopped. This sudden stopping of horn really messed with me. I knew the sound was getting louder until this point. So I backtracked, continuing to press the fob. I couldn't hear a thing. \n\nGoing 30 minutes looking, I decided to start at the bottom and work up. Coming out of the 1st floor door, I pressed the fob. Not expecting to hear anything, I was shocked to hear the horn go off. This time, instead of coming from up above, it came from the basement. So I went down to the basement and there it was, my car. It was paralleled on the back wall. I know for certain that I did not parallel, and I never park in the basement. How did my car get there? \n\nI am originally from a few states away, so there isn't a spare key for hundreds of miles. My fob has never caused another car's to unlock before.\n\nHow did my car move? How was I hearing it from the 4 floors up in a concrete parking ramp?",

        "text": "So I'm sitting here on the couch using my laptop, and my dad is sitting across the room from me watching a NASCAR race, when the police scanner he owns (and listens to religiously) starts making static. This is fairly normal, and is usually just the result of a bad signal, but here's where  it gets weird. I wasn't paying close attention, but I noticed the scanner come on and start to make static. Out of the corner of my eye, I see my father who is sitting next to it reach his hand out towards the scanner, and when it was about fifteen centimeters away, he waved his hand back and forth and the static immediately stopped. At this point, I figured he'd just reached out to turn the scanner off and the static stopped before his hand reached it, and that the whole hand waving thing was just in my head, so I didn't think anything of it. About 30 seconds later, however, the static started again and as I watched more closely, I noticed the exact same thing happen. \n\nTl;dr I just witnissed my father use the force.",

The creepy part is she did too at the exact same time. But it gets even creepier. We then proceeded to both say- \n\"Orange green ten eleven\" \nout loud fast at the exact same time to trip the other one out. \nAfter that we both sort of felt unsettled and creeped out and were sort of silent for the next 30 seconds or so until it faded..\nSo yeah im still sort of shocked about that. As weird as it was its sort of awesome in hindsight. The odds of that happening are just bizarre. Im not really sure what was up but if thats just a coincidence , its a mighty intriguing one! \n",

One of the ladies in the office had left me a voicemail asking me to come in for a drug test. I found this odd because my job knows that I am on school leave. So, I call up my boss after the workout and tell him the situation. He puts me on hold and asks the ladies in the office if they had called me up. He comes back on the phone and says the last time they called me for a drug test was in february and that they did not call anyone in for drug tests that day. ",

I looked at my watch and it read 12:35. As I looked up I see my teacher walk across the room and put a calculator away, I heard the girl behind me get up and I watched her turn in her test.\n\nObviously I felt nothing odd about this so I put my head down to catch some Z's while others finished their tests. I woke up out of nowhere, no sound or any other stimulants had woken me up. I went to look at the time and it read 12:34.\n\nI thought I must have just read the time wrong before, and it must have said 12:25. But then I watched as my teacher walked across the room and put a calculator away, then just like before the girl behind me got up and turned in her test.  \n\nI went and bit the inside of my cheek to see if I felt anything to check if I was still asleep, I felt nothing. As I realized I was dreaming I stood up, put my jacket on then put my head back down to try and wake up.\n\nI woke up again to the sound of the teacher saying class is almost over and we needed to return any supplies. But to my surprise I was still in the jacket that I had put on during the dream. I know for a fact I did not have it on before as it was in my backpack.   \n\nCan someone please explain to me what happened? I can't tell if the recurrence of time happened, or if it was a dream.

Now, I ocasionally listen to my crush's soundcloud uploads on it. That leaves a small window on my lock screen with a picture of of the song being played and some pause/play buttons and the like. \n\nNow, last wednesday it was a fairly dull lunchtime break at school. The library (where I and some friends would hang around) was closed. Me and this other guy went to sit on the couch in the main building, where we pissed around on our computers (tablet, in my case). That is when I turned it on. Nothing unsettling, and nothing of any note; booted up as normal and that was it.\n\nWe proceeded to go and eat lunch not too long after that. I put my tablet to standby and didn't touch it again. Breaktime finished, and I returned to my classes.\n\nAbout two hours later I had a lesson in which we could listen to music. I (almost instictively) took out my tablet, turned on the screen and lo and behold, I was greeted by her face in a square window on the lock screen.\nThe rest is irrelevant; but this is an impossible event. I could not have opened it myself - the app wasn't in the recent apps list. Malware would target my Google Play rather than Soundcloud and Soundcloud can't open by itself in this manner (or at all).\n\nThat is probably everything...ah, except for this: this is a (as far as I'm aware) one sided crush and this secret is mine alone.\n\nThoughts?",

We decided no big deal, we would just walk through the tunnel and try to evoke something. Other than the sounds of a small creek running alongside us, we heard and found nothing at all. We got back in the car and drove through the tunnel looking for a pull off to turn around. After we got turned around and started back through the tunnel, I managed to get the camera to turn on. We laughed at the coincidence and started filming, taunting the \"ghosts\". When we went back to watch and see if we caught anything, the screen was static and the audio was crackling. What we heard was my voice, screaming and cursing at my friends. The video was 15 minutes long and we only recorded no more than 5 minutes worth of video. Since then, the camera never recorded another video and always displays an error message. (It was a flip camera)",

        "text": "So my godmother Caroline, her two sons (the older one is called Tom), my mother an me were on vacation near the baltic sea like eight or ten years ago.\nMum and me bought us two plush worms, who were the mascot of the place we stayed at or something.\nSince I played a lot with these worms during our vacation, I still remember them very accurately. They were about 20cm long and had a head, with a grin in the face and a captain's cap on top. Their colour was white, but mine had a blue stripe winding across its body, my mum's had a red stripe.\n\nSomeday, I saw Tom hiding the red one in a drawer in the living room where we would play with each other all day. A couple of days later, when we had to drive home, my mum searched for her red worm. Because kids are cruel and I thought her searching effort funny (or maybe I just wanted to stay a little longer), I didn't tell her, so she and Caroline had to go trough all our stuff until they finally opened the drawer. My mum and Caro only wondered how it got there (I didn't tell them, of course, and Tom did not confess either).\nBut everything I could think of was: Where has the red stripe gone? The worm's body was pure white now, but his cap and face still had their colour. Nobody seemed to notice, though.\n\nBack home, my mum attached the worm to the bathroom mirror, so I saw it every day and riddled and wondered. As I examined the formerly red worm later, I discovered that you could still see the gap in the worm's \"fur\", where the white fabric had ended and the red fabric had begun, but the colour was simply gone. I was positive that the worm had not moved from that drawer the whole time. And even if it had, where was it now? And where would that other white worm have come from? There had NOT been a single pure white worm in that store and I didn't see one in our flat over the whole vacation. My worm still has his blue stripe today.\nWhen I told my mother about that, she didn't know what I meant. She could not remember any red colour, or at least wasn't sure of it or didn't bother.\n\nI was utterly confused.\n\nI was about twelve years old at that time, so my mind was already pretty reliable. This is not the weird false memory of some little kid. I spend the following months thinking about parallel realities and changes to the universe. The most plausible theory for me at that time were some angels or creatures who had to rebuild reality all the time because of some reasons, maybe to change the course of time and rescue humanity or anything, only this time they got that worm wrong, but when they noticed it was too late and they were like \"okay, if we changed it back now, that boy will know for sure something's happened, let's leave it at that one little weird point in his life.\"\n\nUntil this day I wonder about this incident and can not seem to find a rational explanation.\nIf I had noticed the lack of colour on that worm a month later, I would just have thought it to be some false memory of mine. But since this change in colour unsettled me so deeply, and because I noticed it two days or so after I had last seen the worm and his red stripe, I am 100% convinced that this really happened and that I'm not remembering it falsely.\n\nSomethimg similiar happenend to anyone of you? Some things that were all different out of a sudden? Little details that most people did not notice?",

        "text": "Years ago, when I was a young kid I used to sleepwalk. A lot. I had a terrible case of asthma that was so bad I had to sleep in my parents room just to make sure I didn't have an attack in my sleep. Usually they would wake up and find me missing only to go downstairs and find me wandering the kitchen or the house aimlessly and nothing ever came of it. \n\nThat was until one night I woke up, not sleepwalking, I was completely awake and aware that I was no longer asleep. As I got out of bed I realized I was thirsty and began to make my way downstairs to grab something to drink. Now being a kid about 9 years old I would think if this was a dream i would've forgotten long ago about it but to this day I remember it so vividly.\n\nI walked around the corner and into the kitchen...and stopped dead in my tracks. Underneath the kitchen table there was a SEVERED HEAD, a clearly non human severed head. The skin was grey, the teeth were long and yellow, it was clearly not human. Readers please understand I swear on everything I am that it was there. The worst part of this experience is that the head was alive....yes you read that right, alive. It was thrashing around snarling at whatever it could, and showed no signs of stopping. Terrified, my first and only reaction was to scream my lungs out. At that moment both my parents came barreling down the stairs and around the corner right up behind me. The next thing I knew my mom had grabbed me by the waist, took me to the steps out of view and sat me there telling me to calm down and that it was alright, not to worry and so forth until i finally was able to stop crying. When I was calm enough I stood up and went back into the kitchen to see what happened and there stood my dad holding our trash can, AND IT WAS SHAKING, the head was moving, it was alive still. I don't know what the hell this thing was or why it was in our house but it was there, my mom was standing next to him holding her hand over her mouth in disbelief until I was lead away again and came back a bit while later to discover an empty trashcan. To make matters even more strange my mom and dad acted like nothing had happened, like I was just waking up and coming downstairs but that was simply not the case. This sounds like a terrible dream I know but the thing is, I NEVER woke up, because I had already been awake. I never went back to sleep and I know for a fact that what I saw was a terrible reality.\n\nTo this day I ask my mom from time to time about that incident and the reaction I get is what makes my blood crawl. Her face goes white and she instantly shoots back with, \"it was a dream that's all\" and that's as far of an explanation I can get from her. She hushes me up and changes the subject. Why else would this happen unless she knows it was really there and I wasn't imagining things? ",

        "text": "I've lived for 3 years in an apartment with two other guys, when I was in college. For most weekends, I used to go back home, since it was a near city. I would travel on friday, then head back to the apartment on sunday night.\n\nOn one particular sunday night, I got back to the place and found some hard candies standing in my desk. I'm absolutely sure these weren't mine. The other two guys also claimed they didn't knew about it. They just appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nOf course, a reasonable explanation is perfectly possible, but the whole situation just felt out of place, wrong, glitchy. We were just 3 guys sharing a place and sharing bills, we rarely went in each other's rooms.\n\nAlso, and I don't know if I believe this kind of stuff, but the building was allegedly \"haunted\" (very old building, etc etc). Some people claimed to hear the sound of chains on the floor at night, though I never heard a thing. The candy story was the only weird thing that happened to me. \n\nSorry for the poor grammar!",
