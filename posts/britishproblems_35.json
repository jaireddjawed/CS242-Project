Pretty safe you'd think? \n\nI rode the bike home from the gym at about 9pm, I didn't lock it up as I still needed to go to the corner shop. Started cooking tea when at about 9.30 I got a knock on my front door. Two lads were seen running off with my bike. I chased after them, they threw the bike on the floor.\n\nThis is where the fun starts so I'm chasing down the road with my phone in hand dialling 999. I speak to the operator explain the above, that I can see these two people still, where they have ran, and that I have pictures of them for the police to look at.\n\nThe operator said it wasn't an emergency, that I should call back on 101 and let them deal with it tomorrow. I said I could still see them and I had photos from my CCTV. The operator then said \"If i send police officers and you're lying about this, they will arrest you for wasting police time\".\n\nMy autistic little brain couldn't cope, full stride running down the road, out of breath. I wasn't rude but i said something alone the lines \"why would i fucking lie about this im running down the road chasing some thieves after my bike you can hear me!\". To which the operator started telling me off for swearing and threatened me with arrest again.\n\nI hung up, dialled 999 again, spoke to a different operator. I explained the same thing, within 5 minutes two police cars turned up, helped me with my bike, took the CCTV footage and did a little scout of the surrounding areas to see if they were still around. It's just frustrating because if the first operator had sent a unit, they probably would have caught them.\n\nI now have about £500+ damage to the bike :'((((",

I do donate to charity on a monthly basis. I have five charities I donate to including my local animal shelter. Earlier this year Battersea Dogs Home were chugging (we're in Lancashire) when I told them I already donate to my local shelter he told me to donate to them because they will in turn donate to local shelters. I said I was happy donating directly so as little as possible was taken in admin fees and he got shirty with me. Why would I donate to a nationwide charity who have a large advertising budget in the hope that they throw our local shelter a bit of funding? It doesn't make sense to me but he more or less chased me out of the door trying to get me to switch my donation. Then today a British Army charity were chugging, he also jumped in my way to try and get me to sign up. I told him I donate to the five charities I have funds for and he told me that they were more important than Alzheimers Research and I should switch. I told him I'm happy with who I donate to and the next time I review it I will bear them in mind. Again he followed me to the door trying to change my mind. I have noticed that the chuggers seem to be more aggressive than they were. I know times are hard and I try to do my bit but chasing me around the Supermarket is not going to persuade me to donate and give my bank details on the spot. I would have put a couple of quid in a collection tin but they didn't even have one.",
