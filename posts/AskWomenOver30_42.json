        "text": "Several months ago, I left my former employer for a job that turned out to be a better opportunity--on paper. However, because I'm an out of state employee, the health insurance available to me is *very* expensive and my health insurance covers me and my spouse (my spouse is unable to work right now due to health issues). This, along with some other work-related problems, is adding to my frustration with Current Employer (and frankly, myself because I feel like a fucking idiot for leaving--if I had known this would happen, I would have stayed put). It is literally costing me more to work at Current Employer despite working from home. I know that a modified version of my previous job will be posted fairly soon. I worked at Former Employer twice--the first time around was in a junior-level role and the second time was in a managerial role. How bad would it look to apply to Former Employer a third time? I *am* looking for other roles at other companies, but I also know that the salary and benefits at Former Employer could see me through to retirement.",

I was honest with him about being heartbroken after the divorce, and he said that's ok and he understands. He gave me space and listened to me when I was sad. We work well together as a team and our lifestyles align very well. We want similar things in the future.\n\nThe only problem is that I'm not in love and I know why - it just hasn't been long enough since my ex, and the toxic things I'm typically attracted to (e.g. 'lightness' aka complete lack of responsibility) are absent in this man. He's always there, he's patient and kind. \n\nAt first, I was in the 'let's not overthink this' mode, but it's been over 6 months and I feel like it's time to make a decision. I like him more and more - but still just don't feel like I'm ready for anything serious. I know I might lose him in this process, but it is what it is. I have no desire to date other people, but I also wonder if it's not fair to him for me to keep on dating him if I can't really commit and don't feel myself falling in love. But at the same time, what if that changes (can it?) and I lose a great man in the process? Ugh, I thought these things are supposed to get easier with age.",

Like my brain knows I shouldddd ask but I feel like I have this weird fear or anxiety now built in because of that. Like I’ve gotten so much shit about it forever but I just have never changed. \n\nIt’s something I want to understand and change. I just don’t know where to start. I do try really hard. Like tonight I was walking through the living room and there was a bag of chocolates on the couch and I reached down to see which ones and take one before putting the bag away. I thought that it was brought out to share with the roommates but in retrospect, I probably just assume that because that’s what I would do. My roommate woke up and gave me shit and 💯 deserved. I think I just don’t see those things as big deals, but this particular roommate does and I just honestly didn’t even think about it—- it was like oh, I wonder what ones she has, she probably brought them out for everyone during the movie, I’ll have one and put the bag in her drawer. \n\nLike I’m not a bad person…. I just suck at asking for things. I personally think it goes way back to my childhood somewhere …. But for as long as I can remember, I have taken food and snacks from people without asking- my earliest memory being when I was like 11 or 12. \n\nAnywaysssss. How can I break this terrible habit? Has anyone else had this issue? \n\nTy 💜",

        "text": "Please don't upvote. Looking for outside female perspectives. \n\n2022 was a bad year. \n\nI'm looking for some advice on how to deal with my (38f) sister in law (55ish/f). \n\nIn short, my spouse had a mental health break, became suicidal, and was  (somewhat) taken advantage of by an older/higher ranking female physician while on deployment over the summer. It's a complicated situation. On one hand, her practices were predatory, on the other hand he's an adult in his 40's that knows the difference between right and wrong (mental health or not). However, as a healthcare professional myself- after reading through their correspondence there's some really disgusting behavior on the physicians end (i.e. if you need a \"safe space\" come to my room and aggressively pursing him). I reported this situation and the military is essentially doing nothing. \n\nI'm not making excuses for my spouse (or asking for how to report this provider- I worked in mil healthcare for four years, I've exhausted those resources) that's not the reason for this post. \n\nThe meat of my request: I was not aware my spouse was having an affair. I was convinced he was having a mental health break (and he is/was). During this time I turned to my sister in law. We have a friendship and she's very close to us both. \n\nAt the time, again, I did not know about this affair with the physician. I found out about six weeks later after going through his icloud- something wasn't feeling right.\n\nMy spouse is home now and I've been going through his text messages while we sort this mess out. I read the texts his sister sent. Some of you may think this is a violation of privacy and I get that. We have open phone policies. He knew I was doing this.  For time line's sake:\n\nJune 19: Conversation with spouse- spouse acting odd. Sounding manic. Saying incredibly concerning things (i.e. leaving job to work in a field he has no experience in, the military is now his family- the family at home is nothing, etc..). Reached out to SIL to offer more support to him. \n\nJune 20: Sister in law contacts spouse. Spouse clearly tells her about his affair with the physician. \n\nJune 22-July 17th: Sister in law and spouse discussing affair. \n\nDuring this time, I kept telling my sister in law my concerns for mental health and she seemed very flippant (their family has a lot of mental health issues). She asked me a few times if I thought there was someone else to which I said he told nothing had happened and he's never given me a reason not to trust him. She said something about how she didn't think he would cheat either because he's never been that way. She knew he was having an affair though. \n\nShe was dropping her kid off at my house, came over for dinner (watched me cry because I had no idea why my spouse wasn't communicating), etc.. My brother has been living with me and mentioned he felt this was all very weird. He didn't expect her to exactly rat out her brother, but it was the coming over and watching me cry, asking the questions about what I thought, dropping her kid off, etc.. It left a bad taste in his mouth. \n\nAnd I gotta say, I feel a bit betrayed. In her texts, I see her clearly telling him what a wonderful person I am, but also treating the doctor like a viable option for  a partner.. this bothers me as well- his sister knew  this was a physician treating him for suicidal ideation, 13 years older, and in a position of power. But like my brother said- the asking me what I would do if he was cheating, if I thought he was cheating, coming over and watching me break apart, barely sleep/eat over the last five months.. I'm in shock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I know myself and I love my little brother (34/m) more than anything. I would tell his wife- and we would deal with the fallout together. I have no doubt if my spouse went to him- my brother would give me an ultimatum to tell him myself or he would. But I know that's us and our personality type. And while I didn't expect her to tell me, she knew her brother was not asking for a divorce, leaving me in limbo, and really destroying my mental health and didn't even hint at it. Her questioning kind of grosses me out now I look over it. \n\nAnd I don't blame her for the affair. I'm trying to sort through my relationships with everyone. And I am struggling with this one. I'm supposed to see her and my niece in a few days for a post holiday gift exchange- I find myself not wanting to go.",

She is constantly into a new interest because that's just how her brain is and I love that trait.\n\nBut then she brings it to me like I'm supposed to be fired up like her, and I find the impact on me is similar to people who are accidental \"energy vampires.\"\n\nSo let's say this week she's really into basket weaving. She'll text me with a lot of \"Omg! So I'm taking this class, and....!!! And then I learned MY style of basket weaving which is called xyz!!\" \n\n^ So imagine that, but like 5 paragraphs of it, if not more.\n\nSo then I might respond kind of like this: \"Cool! I'm glad you're getitng so much out of it. What you said about [thing] makes a lot of sense! Nice, that's crazy to hear that you could apply your ice fishing skills to this class. Hmm, I think my basket weaving style might be abc.\"\n\nAND THEN, without so much as asking if I care or want more information, she will take my last sentence to the nth degree and, without asking if I want to know more, send me about 10 texts of information, oh and voice notes too, about my basket weaving style. It's like showing any interest sends her into a frenzy lol. And it's a headache for me, which I hope makes sense to everyone. \n\nI would find it really rude to do that to someone, like capturing their attention on MY interest without checking in, but she's not trying to be rude. However, I know she would find it just as presumptuous and irritating and kinda disrespectful if people were doing it to her. So what's the Tactful Style of saying, \"Wow you have bad social skills in this area and it makes me not want to talk to you.\"?\n\nBonus points if you can think of behaviors to display that give her the hint without me having to squash the enthusiasm of this incredibly well-meaning enthusiasm bomb.\n\nI personally have learned better social skills throughout my life from subtle feedback. So I'm not trying to throw a stop sign in her face, but I'm thinking phrases along these lines: \"Wow that's a lot of information! I didn't get through it yet but hopefully by this weekend because I'm focused on my own [area of interest] right now. Thanks for sending.\" What do you think?",

        "text": "I'd like to preface that I'm not a big texter (especially during the work week). Quality time is my love language so I prefer getting to know someone face to face as opposed to text rapport. I also like to read body language and get a sense of how the person carries themselves and if they're receptive to my presence. \n\nI (32F) met this guy (32+?M) at an underground nightclub two weekends ago and we had breakfast at a restaurant afterwards that same morning. It was a good time, the conversation flowed and we have a number of things in common. Two days later I texted him thanking him for breakfast and expressed interest in seeing him again. He said \"yes, it would be great to meet up with you, let me know some dates and time that work well for you. I'm around and would love to do something fun together\". So I responded two days later, sharing that weekends generally work better for me but I have the week of Dec-26 off and also asked if he had NYE plans. He responded with a long text that seemed somewhat scripted (i.e considering a vacay to an island to get away from winter, wrapping up his work out). He said he was happy I reached out and that he had thought of me... he also said to let him know what days work and suggested a movie/show. \n\nOne thing was said that I found off-putting - \"And of course I'm open to doing more than that if you're up for it (devil emoji) no pressure\". Mind you, when we met I shared that hooking up wasn't my intention here and I haven't dated/been intimate with anyone since my last relationship ended 2.5 years ago. I also shared that I don't like chasing people and he said that he doesn't either. \n\nI wasn't sure of how to respond to that so I waited it out. I messaged him on Xmas wishing him happy holidays and he did the same asking how things were...this is when I started proposing a day to meet. I proposed Tuesday and he said the evening would work for him and asked if it would work for me. I then realized I had a commitment on Tuesday evening and instead proposed the afternoon which didn't work for him. The next day I asked him what time frame would work for him and he said the morning. I then asked if he was up for meeting in the morning and if a cafe would work or if he had something in mind. He did not respond/confirm until that very morning - he mildly apologized (said he'd been driving all day and was tired) and said he could come pick me up right away. This was at 8:45am and I was asleep. I responded at 10:30 sharing I had gone to an event the night prior and thought he was no longer interested since I hadn't heard from him. Instead of addressing the latter part of my message, he asked how the event went.\n\nI got fed up and haven't responded. It felt one-sided trying to schedule a meetup and his shorter texts made him seem less enthused but I'm not sure if it's all in my head or not. He has not reached out to attempt to schedule anything. I am disappointed and it's messing with my self-esteem. If I were to try again what would be the best approach? Do/would I seem desperate? And should I be more conversational via text?",

I am HSP and I am all about the feelings, once I get feelings for someone I tend to loose myself and really get insecure and I want to change this.\n\nIn my current situation I have developed feelings for a good friend of mine (M42) We both like each other and about a month ago I shared that I want to explore if there is more than friendship only, he was open to discuss this further which we did and decided to slowly see where it will take us. \n\nSo here come my problem.. I fully believe him, I trust him and he is trusthworthy and I know he cares about me but I get so insecure and start to loose myself and I hate it, it's not just this situation but also past situations. My insecurities kick in and I only imagine worst outcomes and plant negative thoughts in my head and I always loose myself in the process. I just really want to work on this and get over this, my life should not evolve around a person and I should be thinking positive thoughts because nothing bad happened. I am strong and secure in many other aspects in life and often think I am much better off not having feelings for anyone.\n\nWho recognizes this or has similar experiences and has some advice on what I can do to overcome this step by step. I would really appreciate any help as it will be a lesson for life ❤️",

May be it is more than a coincidence \n\nThe thing is , around mid December she told me she got invited with gym friends for a Christmas dinner , I thought,  all right no problem , I tried to auto-invite me but she told me it was only her gym group and she will be with her friend in which case is also our neighbour.\n\nThe day of the night out my wife went out and I stayed at home , I order some take away for dinner when I came down to pick the delivery , my neighbour was here , she could not make it, and my neightold me my wife went with the gym gang and she is with Mike and I don't need to be worry about.\n\nLater tha night my wife came back a bit late , no drama about it , but I noticed some odd ... I did not want to overreact and I leave it easy.\n\nDays later Christmas and New year nights arrive and in both occasions,  she woke up very early and went out to do workouts with MiKe , she told me , her pt offer her a private winter package and they are doing private workouts at his building gym.\n\n I've asked her how extra this will be and my wife told me initially is free but she needs to meet the objectives , it is kind of a challenge. \n\nNot sure if this might be a issue ? I'm trying to be objective and definitely I don't wanna make a scene... but I got the feelings they might be having an affair \n\nSorry if this extend but I tried to give an overview and I would like to know your thoughts,  point of view , anything else feel free to ask \n\nThanks in advance",

        "text": "In dealing with a combination of being burnt out with big city living, overworked, and the ending of a lot of one sided friendships, I'm having a lot of regret about establishing myself so far away from my parents for the past 8 years. I feel like the adult norm in the US is to leave your immediate family and form your own with a spouse + friends but I can't help but feel that all the time I invested in temporary people and a thankless career, I could have spent with my parents and siblings.\n\nI want to ask my job if I can go primarily remote so that I can move back in with my parents for at least a few weeks each month and still keep my apartment for the time being. My fear is that I'm regressing and running home to the comfort of mom and dad even though I wasn't close to them growing up and have been very independent as an adult. I'm also scared that this is an easy answer vs putting myself out there to date again and trying to make new friends. But then again - what if those things just aren't in the cards for everyone? I'm much happier being around family than sitting at a bar trying to make connections for the sake of not being lonely. Yet there's a part of me that knows once my parents pass, it'll feel like my whole world has evaporated. And then again, maybe this is me overcoming my hyper-independence and admitting that I need more support in the immediate.\n\nDoes anyone spend a lot of time with their parents and siblings instead of friends and spouses? Am I too old (late 20s) to live with my parents again? Will I feel like I made a mistake down the line if I do this?",

I've searched for other posts, and I hate reading comments like \"mine haven't changed at all\" or referencing being able to still pass the \"pencil test\" and it just makes me feel so sad and unlucky that I didn't get the good breast genetics. Even doing weightlifting hasn't given me more lift. If anything, they just shrank more. I hate being on top during sex because I don't like the way they hang when I'm leaning over him. It even makes me feel panic like I didn't *do* enough to keep them from sagging. That's a ridiculous thought, right? Like I should've moisturized more or wore some type of support to sleep in. Someone talk some sense into me!\n\nAnyone else in the same boat? I made the mistake of trying to find photos of normal looking breasts (like the sites with hundreds of different vulvas) but encountered some images from plastic surgeons showing what \"normal\" is and it just made me feel fucking awful. SO many images of breast lift surgery, and I look like the before picture, or worse!",

        "text": "I'm 38F in NYC and I've been at an Amlaw to 50 firm as a practice group coordinator for over a year now. I had NO IDEA it would be this hard. This has been all new to me as I was originally in fundraising/ development at some big name nonprofits, then an executive assistant on and off for 8 years in the corporate sector, a project coordinator at a top management consulting firm (got laid off due to COVID-19) and a project coordinator at a tech startup that paid crap, So with no experience I took this job for the money alone. \n\nIt has not been going well. The stress of getting everything absolutely perfect, even in draft form, is ridding me with anxiety. I can't send an e-mail or calendar invite without being frozen at my desk in fear that I missed a time zone or left out a Partner's name and am going to get a nasty e-mail.\n\nI'm used to drafting something, getting edits from my boss, and wordsmithing it together. Here, that's a waste of time. I need to self manage and produce final draft work product at all times. The pressure is intense.\n\nYes, I have thick skin. Yes, I have had stressful Jon's before. But the minutae and teeny tiny attention to granular details is killing my productivity. The intense focus for the type of work I'm doing leaves my brain fried.\n\nThere are so many duplicate processes and redundant manual updating of documents when I'm used to a CRM and running data exports. IManage is a nightmare when I'm used to SharePoint. \n\nYes, I proofread my work. I save it as a draft and go back to it. I double and triple check. I print it out, read it out loud, all that. I've started using flowcharts too. \n\nI'm used to doing status reports, contracts, burndown charts, pitch decks, offer letters, resume packets, etc.\n\nHow do I train my brain to do this small-scale work when I've never had to before? Doing 100% detail obsessed work 10 hours a day five days a week is really,really hard for me. Then the anxiety kicks in that my team will never be happy, I'll never be good enough, so why bother? Maybe it's just not a good fit but I need to master these administrative details because it's going to be there in any job I have. I know this.\n\nMy team says I'm not adding value because they have to proofread my work (every other job I had as a coordinator this was a given. A senior person proofed my work and signed off on it). \n\nI'm looking to move on to training or learning and development roles also. I'm getting my master's in industrial organizational psychology and I'm really interested in associate development. That's the goal in my next move but I can't have these bad habits follow me.\n\nI have a therapist. I'm on 20 MG Lexapro a day. I just need a bit of insight how these law firms tick.\n\nTLDR: practice group coordinator bogged down by anxiety and making a ton of mistakes and can't get out of her own head. Lacking confidence due to bullying director and condescending senior manager.",

I did it to get out my comfort zone and socialise at my own pace. Get some social skills. I’m meeting new people as host and sharing my mobile number with a select few which gave me anxiety but I remembered I’m in control of what I share and who I let in. But it still feels weird. Maybe I’m triggered by a recent friend betrayal etc. or the “evil eye”. \n\nI get suspicious of people who are “keen” to know more about me. My walls go up if they ask something personal like if I’m dating etc. because I don’t want to be rude and sometimes overshare. Today I was asked if I’d join a WhatsApp group and I said yes just to give it a go but I’ll likely have it on mute. I’m just scared of drama.\n\nIt’s weird because I want to make friends for deep connections, friends for fun and good contacts in general. Just wondering how to find a balance. Any advice?",

And I don't mean sex, it's anything. There's no tender hug or cuddling. With him everything goes to sex. At the point that if he hugs me, sometimes feels like a dog in the heat, if you know what I'm saying. He explained to me that it's his way of express affection to me. That he doesn't see difference between \" kind touch to sex touch\", and that everything can goes naturally to sex. Cuddling it's not an option, because if I try it, he'll think that it's ok to start something. \n\nI obviously feel good that he desires me after all those years, but sometimes I just want some good soft romance. Just be in the couch cuddling in peace. And now I'm even seating at the opposite side of the couch because I don't want to have sex so better to not try cuddles. It's worse because I have endometriosis and other things, so it's not easy to always want sex. Sometimes I'm just in pain wanting a hug. He understands that, but he thinks it's ok to seat grabbing my boobs because for him it's just care and affection and I don't like it,  I don't want anyone grabbing my boobs like a squeeze ball all the time. Is that weird?\n\nI spoke with therapist about that. He told me that it's just us being different and that's ok, I should raise my boundaries to both feel respected, and that actually the lack of connection that I feel it's probably because of my partner autism traits. I agree, but bothers me. I don't know, feels like he doesn't touch me to make me feel good, but just to him feel pleasure. And if I explain, he doesn't understands, he truly think everyone is the same as him.\n\nIt makes sense?? I don't know if counseling it's a way. We are waiting for the adult specialist in neurodiversity appointment, because our both therapists say that it's important to understand better the differences, but I feel so uncomfortable and It's not a good feeling when your married.\n\nI know it's weird to just realize things now, after so much time, but it's was a really long journey and I my background didn't help. Now after couple of years of therapy, I'm seeing and understanding things, like I don't need to satisfy everyone. I feel embarrassed, but at the same time, proud that I'm growing, even late 😅",

I understand that both of them have a lot in common and they don't run out of things to talk about. I'm almost 40, living far from my parents on my own, I travel many hrs just to visit them at least every few months. But when I'm away from them, my mother will never reach out to me, she will only send me a text when they run out of money but she will not check on me just to see if I'm still alive or whenever I call her she doesn't listen to what I say or even ask how I am doing, basically its like I'm talking to a wall. So now I'm here for 3 weeks spent my holidays with them I've noticed that she will call my sister at least few times a day, it really hurts me because she seem very happy when they talk and there is a back and forth conversation between the two of them. It seems so unfair because I do everything for my mom and Dad, I am the only one who takes care fully of their financial needs(my sister doesn't give them anything because she always claims she don't earn as much as I do). I'm the one who was readily available when my Dad got into accident, and my mom will still tell everyone that my sister made sacrifices to take care of my Dad eventhough all along its me who was here the whole time. I tried so hard to be close to her but she always push me away. I've been thinking of just cutting communication with her but I can't do that because of my Dad, he is disabled right now and I can only talk or check on him through my mom since he doesn't use a phone due to his poor eyesight. I know my mom thinks I'm weird or a loser since up to this age I don't have anyone or my own family bit I have a very good job that ables me to provide morethan their needs but I never felt appreciated for all the things I sacrificed for them.

We have a great relationship and I would say he is the best partner I’ve ever had. He is super confident, attractive, takes care of his health and has tons of passions and hobbies. However, I am his first serious girlfriend. He is less sexual than me and sometimes I feel like I want to be more kinky (while I admit he is far from vanilla) but I can’t help but feel I’m teaching him to be a partner sometimes. Ie: love languages, communication, etc. He is a wonderful person and makes me feel loved but I think he still has to get used to dealing with my emotions and learning how to be there for me in tough times. Anyone else experience this? I might just be over complicating things since this is the first healthy relationship I’ve been in lol. I thrive in chaos. How can I guide my partner to be a better partner without “changing” him or seeming controlling?",

        "text": "I am 37 and got married a few weeks ago to my bf/fiancé of 5 years.  We did a very small family luncheon to do our legal vows so we could get me on his health insurance since mine was pretty crappy through my job.\n\nNow that we are married…there are three big things we want to do and I just don’t see how we can financially move forward.  As things stand, we make enough money for our life.  We rent a 2br apartment, we have a dog and we go on one vacation a year.  When we do travel we don’t do crazy 5 star vacations, we can usually do 2 weeks in Europe for $2k a piece.  But other than that we don’t have any crazy expenses, we both drive older cars that are paid off, and neither of us buy alot of clothing or have an expensive hobby.  The only thing I think we could cut back on is eating out which we are working on.  I do want to mention we live in NJ so the general cost of living is really high.\n\nOk so the three things: we want to have a bigger wedding where we can invite all our friends that we couldn’t invite to our vows lunch, we want to buy a house, and we want to start a family.  Me being 37 also puts one of those things on a bit of a time crunch but I did have my eggs frozen at 31.  We did a walk through of the venue we have our hearts set on for our wedding and we’re talking $35k easy.  We currently have $12k in savings but we have credit card debt we are working on paying down.\n\nI think I just can’t see a path forward to make a big financial jump to where we want to be, especially within 5 years.  We can cut our one vacation and that would save us a few grand.  Currently my salary isn’t great so I’m looking for a new job (I make about $63k a year but I think I could find something closer to $80k).  My logical brain tells me to put the wedding last but the idea of planning a wedding with a baby/toddler sound awful.  And call me vain but I’ve been working really hard on losing weight this year and I don’t want the mental torture of trying to work off a post partum body to get into a wedding dress.  I also don’t want to have a baby before we purchase a house because as far as I know babies are expensive and any little saving we can do now would probably evaporate.\n\nWhat should we do…speak with a financial planner?  Just try to get a house with the minimum down payment so we aren’t sinking money into rent any more?  Consider purchasing a condo instead of a house so we can atleast build some equity?  My husband is pushing the baby pretty hard (not in a disrespectful way or anything) but he’s 43, his parents are in their mid 70s and he wants to make sure we have as much time as possible for our kids to have their grandparents.\n\nThank you if you took the time to read this far!",

        "text": "I have mostly good relationship with my mother, but I still feel extremely stressed and anxious when she calls, and inevitably feel intensely guilty and anxious after talking with her or visiting her. This happens even when we have a “good” or neutral phone call or visit and just make small talk, or when we talk about deeper issues (family dynamics, etc.). Lately I’ve been thinking this is possibly because I know my mom desperately wants us to be close and have a very close mother-daughter relationship, but we have very little in common.\n\nFor example, my mom is starting another diet (she’s done so many over the years and I can’t understand how she doesn’t see that following fad diets is the real issue), and was first trying to get me to do it with her (no way) but now still wants to talk about it. I feel like she wants an accountability partner or at least wants us to commiserate or celebrate “weight loss” together, because I recently got a gym membership. But we can’t because I want to change my relationship with food, my body, and movement and don’t have specific weight loss or fitness goals. I don’t want to punish myself for “lack of willpower” or whatever. And I honestly don’t want to talk about it that much. \n\nI feel like this dynamic is present in almost all aspects of our relationship- she wants us to bond, we see the world differently, she is disappointed and doesn’t understand this or me, and then keeps trying to bond over these things. I know she loves me and we get along fine, but there’s not the depth and bond there. I wish I could get to a place of true acceptance of her and who she is, but I can’t seem to overcome the intense dread of seeing her name on and incoming call. And I feel awful about that. My mom is not a bad person, and I hate that I have so many awful feelings surrounding our interactions.\n\nAnyone else struggle with this? Or have advice on how overcome that dread?",

I agreed to come with him because I needed a change and my job is remote, so I can work anywhere.\n\nThere wasn’t much selection for furnished apartments when we planned our move almost a year ago. I did the best I could to ask questions and had the landlord do a virtual walk through with us, and the place we selected seemed fine. We signed the lease in the spring. Furthermore, my boyfriend had the opportunity to see the place in person last fall when he was in town for a conference. He said it was great, kitchen and bathroom were modern, etc. I was very excited to move and to not have to worry about doing a lot of work to get settled. I had just moved in with him from my own place, had been working 12 hours daily and was dealing his with two recent cancer diagnoses all in the past 2 months, so I was just about at the end of my rope by the time of the second move.\n\nFlash forward to moving day, where we travelled over 12 hours with three cats (two of whom have severe anxiety) only to find that the place is very, very different from what I expected. There are cobwebs, holes in the wall, furniture is all scratched and broken and it smells. I don’t think the carpet or upholstery have been washed.\n\nI was feeling very ill from air travel, so I told him and his mother (who came with us to help move the cats) to go get dinner without me. In the meantime I booked myself a hotel because the smell was so awful. We had a discussion last night and I said that the place was very different to how he described it. He said that he was used to renting places with cockroaches and leaking ceilings so he thought this place was fine, especially since it was only temporary. For reference, he previously lived in a beautiful new condo (which his parents picked out and decorated for him). His prior experience with rentals was when he was in undergrad.\n\nI just don’t know what to do. I’m starting work again in 3 days and I won’t have the physical or mental energy to fix and refurnish an entire 3 bedroom suite when I’m back to working constant overtime. I’m thinking of renting a second place for myself to give me time and mental space to think this over. He feels awful but doesn’t have the time to fix it up either as he’s writing the biggest exams of his life in March and April and needs to focus on studying.\n\nLooking for some support and advice in the comments.",

        "text": "I'm so tired and frustrated and have been working unproductively on New Year Eve and will be working whole weekend. I'm in a relatively new job (&lt; 1 year) even though I've known my manager before that, we worked together in a previous company. I always knew she was a workaholic but in this new company it seems like she has those expectations for her direct reports too. \n\nI'm taking 3 weeks of vacation in January. I'm traveling for 2 weeks and a staycation for one week because I'm so goddam tired and haven't taken time off in what feels like ages. I joined directly from my last company due to immigration reason.\n\nLast week my manager made a list of 20 things I needed to do before I left for my break. This was on top of my usual job and meetings and commute. I started tackling this list but it is a LOT OF WORK. I told her I cannot get it done with the meetings so she said I can take it on between Christmas and new year when there are less people in the office. I have gotten about half the things done since but it is tough because there's no one to answer my questions and I'm one of the only people in the office other than her. I've been working from my laptop even after coming home every evening.\n\nShe kept asking me every day if I've completed the remaining ten things and I told her I'm trying and shared with her the half completed deliverables and what's remaining. She pulls up the list she sent and pointed out how she had requested completed documents and not half-completed ones and how she was losing sleep over this and the fact I'm \"disappearing\" for 3 weeks. She says she's doing this in my best interest as she wants me to have the best time in my vacation without any work disturbance.\n\nI've been crying the whole day because I absolutely hate my life and who I am in this job. I'm so burnt out I don't even feel like myself and completing those 10 things has become the biggest mental chore. I was initially planning something nice with my 2 weeks (honeymoon) but I'm reconsidering - should I cancel my plans and apply for jobs? I can't be in this country without a job, so I don't have the luxury of being unemployed. Even my staycation doesn't feel fun anymore as it looks like I'll just be sending resume out. With the job market seeming tough, I don't know what to do other than feel absolutely depressed at my decision to join this company (which I did partly because she seemed good to work with in the last company). Please any advice will be helpful, I can't seem to get out of my head.",
