        "text": "Here’s one critique by physicist Steven Weinberg I found interesting: He says, “Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood.”\n",

        "text": "I’m doing a computer science/physics joint major. It’s easy for me to like physics because it describes the laws of nature which I intrinsically find interesting and mysterious. I’ve never been into technology but I like some math, science, and philosophy of science. I know computer science is also theoretically deep but so far I’ve just learned about some graph theory, time complexity, algorithms, Chomsky Hierarchy, etc. At first glance these things spiked my interest but they became dryer the more I learnt about them. To me it’s just about organizing information which is extremely useful but not awe inspiring. I’m wondering why I have an affinity for physics, but not for computer science. Anyway, my main goal with computer science is to become computationally literate because I know that will carry over into physics research and industry if I decide to go that route. I know there’s people out there that are seriously interested in computer science and the deeper nature of it, so I’m wondering how they view the discipline. As with most people, it’s a lot more fulfilling when you’re interested in what you’re studying.",

On the board in class it seemed fun and easy so i thought the test wouldn't be too bad. However actually trying to do it....it's so hard, maybe I'm missing something? I'm looking at a simple example of doubling the amount of 1s and even when the solution is given its such a pain to keep track of which stage I'm on, the example gives 12 stages for such a simple function with loopings. It's hard enough to follow the steps and double the amount, I just spent hours looking at that one example.  let aloneI have no idea where to start in actually coming up with a machine. Like there doesnt seem to be any intuitive reasoning involved. Am I missing something? How do you base computing off of this",

Until now, I have named them a bit like this:\n\n    project\n     |----lib/\n       |----a/\n         &lt;a&gt;_&lt;name&gt;.c\n         and so on ...\n       |----b/\n         &lt;b&gt;_&lt;name&gt;.c \n         and so on ...\n    |----include/\n      |----a\n        &lt;a&gt;_&lt;name&gt;.h\n        and so on ...\n      |----b\n        &lt;b&gt;_&lt;name&gt;.h\n        and so on ...\n    |----src/\n      file1.c\n      file1.h\n      file2.c\n      file2.h\n\nSo I would also like to know if it is redundant to add &lt;a&gt; or &lt;b&gt; in the beginning of each file just to indicate it is part of this particular library. The reason I do this is just be able to understand from which lib it comes from.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n\n                ",

        "text": "In Steel Division: Normandy 44, they implemented what they call a [dynamic frontline](https://www.eugensystems.com/steel-division-normandy-44-gameplay-dynamic-front-line/). It separates allied and enemy units graphically by placing a dividing line that automatically adjusts its shape based on unit presence and their zone of control. How could that be implemented?\n\nMy first guess was extracting a line from a Voronoi diagram, but that wouldn't make the line smooth and pretty, and you'd have to deal with the situation where you have many units near each other from one side having the same effect on frontline as just a single unit from the other side - which I don't think is how it actually behaves. I haven't played the game, but I assume a numerical advantage can overwhelm the enemy and the frontline shape should reflect that.\n\nThe solution for make the line smooth is to use the vertices of the \"segmented\" line, that's extracted from a Voronoi diagram, as the input for a spline, a smooth curve.\n\nI don't know how to add a unit \"strength\" into the computation that would move the frontline away from stronger units and closer to weaker units. Another problem would be the amount of CPU time the computation would take for re-calculating the Voronoi. A third problem is that you don't want to move the line all the way back if your units are not opposed by the enemy; ideally you'd still want the line to remain somewhat stable and re-shape only based on your advance.\n\nSo for starters, is there a curve that - instead of trying to follow through a set of input points - tries to avoid from them?\n\nLet me know if I'm not clear enough anywhere in my post.",

        "text": "Just a heads up before I start, I learnt this all in German so my terminology might be off by a little\n\nSo the title kinda sucks but today in my it finals there was an fsa that parses latlong coordinates and the final question of that block was \"'the fsa can syntactically parse coordinates but it is unable to draw information from them so it's impossible to make an fsa that accepts coordinates that lie inside Germany' comment on this statement\" so I went on to think about it and its kind of obvious that for any finite set of words (that the fsa should accept) there exists an fsa that accepts the language containing this set of words because you can build a sort of tree structure. For each starting letter of the set if this starting letter appears only once then make a path for that word, otherwise append a kind of sub-fsa for the set of words that start with that starting letter. And that would leave you with an fsa that accepts that set of words. That was a hard to understand pseudo code algorithm but it kind of works and I'll get the points for that task. But the proof doesn't feel very robust, it feels weak. I should probably mention the question was specifically about deterministic fsa because for non-deterministic fsa you can just make a path for each word. And I guess then you could simplify that non-deterministic fsa so I just answered my own question. Oops. \n\nMy question now would have been \"is there a more vigorous proof for the fact that any given set of words has an fsa that accepts those and only those words\" but I answered that myself. Still, is that the most \"elegant\" proof?",
