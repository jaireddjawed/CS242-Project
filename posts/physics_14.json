        "text": "You can just skip to the dots \" ........ \" If you want to read the experiment only. If you want to seriously respond though, please read the rest as well, so that you know where I'm coming from. \n\nI am only an undergraduate physics student and therefore my understanding of the Casimir effect is somewhat limited at the moment and I'm hoping this thread can further my understanding of it and QFT in general. And probably also dispell any wrong perceptions I have of all of it. \n\nI would like to find out if this experiment would be useful in any way, and secondly I'd also like to know the answer to some other stuff regarding quantum fields. \n\nI'll start with my proposed Casimir effect experiment... \n\nIf this topic is a question of interest for any reason (again, I will say I have no idea what it could mean if it's all proved or not) then maybe this experiment could possibly prove or disprove a localised transfer of a universal constant of virtual particle \"creation\" and \"annihilation\" rate (if this even exists).  \n\n....................................\n....................................\n\nFor arguments sake, say, for example, that within a vacuum cubic meter (outside of a large gravity well...I assume that's important? Haha), there must always be a finite amount of virtual particle creation and annihilation per second. If a region of the space is too small, then these events must occur elsewhere within the cubic meter. \n\n^ I know that might not be accurate in reality (it's actually one of the things I'm interested in understanding more, so if anyone has insight into that, it'd be appreciated). However, I felt it necessary to restrict certain parameters just to get the point across and make it clear what I'd like to propose I'm suggesting all of this could prove or disprove.  \n\nSo firstly, a primary experiment on the Casimir effect using two plates would be commenced. It'd then be confirmed that the Casimir force on the plates is in effect and the magnitude be measured. \n\nThen a secondary Casimir effect experiment (or rather one on the threshold of what we can begin to measure) be conducted immediately below (or above...to the side... whatever) the primary one in such a way similar to a series electrical circuit. i.e. Not in parallel. \n\nSo it'd look like this: \n\nPrimary   -------&gt;  l l\nSecondary ----&gt;  l  l \n\n- It sort of goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway. In the crude diagram above, the vertical line is one dimension of a metal plate. Assume the second dimension is the width of the line on the screen, and the third goes in or out of the screen. \n\n\nThis secondary experiment must have plates of a larger width apart than the primary one. Preferably exactly far enough apart so that if they were moved any closer, then a measured Casimir effect would be observed. \n\nThese secondary plates should ideally not be experiencing a noticeable force when measured, IF AND ONLY IF they were not next to the primary experiment. \n\nThe reason is so that if there is a transfer of virtual particle creations that moves away from the primary restricted space (because they are no longer able to physically exist there), then it's possible that the fluctuations along the fields will shift immediately towards the nearest space large enough to accommodate their brief existence. \n\nSo in theory the secondary experiment should experience a build up in virtual particles above that of normal unrestricted vacuum. And, if all sides could all be measured, then it would be the positive counterpart to the magnitude of negative energy experienced within the primary experiment. \n\nNow I'll say I have no idea how an underlying mechanism could work towards shifting these processes. It's also difficult to use analogy because it's negative energy. \n\nBut I think a good way to imagine the nonsense I've proposed is by imagining water being squeezed out of a water bottle. At one point it's being restricted and under pressure, and once it's out it is free and under less pressure, but it had to move through space from one point to the other to experience this (through a known mechanism we're all familiar with in the classical world). \n\nThat's the best analogy I've got I guess. \n\nLastly, I'll say that even if any of this stuff I've said is true, then this experiment may not be a conclusive disproval of a transfer of this rate constant because perhaps the transfer is not local and instead occurs on the other side of the universe in ways we don't understand. .... however I get the feeling everything I've said is a bit ridiculous anyway and I'll be told most of its not real 😃 \n\n\n................\n\n\n\nThese next few questions are apart of the stuff I don't understand and which I'd like to and relate to the above in some ways. Also some of it seems like they're thoughts I've had that are likely meaningless in and of themselves and a sort of like a circular physics dead end that sounds cool, but in essence is meaningless. \n\n....\n\n\nRegarding this underlying mechanism I've proposed. Is this string theory stuff? Or is it just total garbage?  How does a virtual particle of a certain energy come into existence for that small moment? I don't mean the old uncertainty principle explanation of \"because it can\", but rather do some sort of even more fundamental particles (or fundamental parts of the field. Or even fields within a field haha) begin to build up in the quantum fields like waves and eventually constructively interfere enough to the point they create a virtual particle event? \n\nIf so, that something like that seems a good way to explain the transition from one space to another in the above experiment haha. \n\nThis next question seems it's likely trash... \n\nIs it possible that each specific particle has an infinite number of quantum fields, all of which correspond uniquely to a discrete energy level of that type of particle? \n\nI know in QFT that it's proposed, for example, there is a single electron field throughout the universe. Excitations in this field are responsible for what we perceive as electrons (that's my rudimentary understanding). So it is possible there isn't just one? And instead an infinite amount (or I guess finite amount that corresponds exactly to the number of total electrons) that all link discretely to a single electrons energy level? \n\nSo each field has a discrete energy that only an electron of that energy will be used by it. Or perhaps even fields that encapsulate a range of energy levels, and yet are the same type of \"particle\" field. \n\nThe reason I wondered about this was because such fields might not interact with one another and cause a build up of energy that needed releasing (it was related to thinking about thr \"mechanism\" I mentioned above). \n\nI admit that the last few paragraphs seem way out there and almost certainly have no value haha 😬\n\nAnyway, if you made it this far, cheers for reading and if you know a lot more than me and want to explain the things I don't understand, or just got plain wrong, then please comment. \n\nThanks.",

        "text": " Hi all. \n\nFor this, we're going to only use the word 'time' as a unit of measurement from earth. We're holding a stopwatch on earth and so when I say fifty years I mean whatever unit you want to call 1825 (50x 365) earth rotations etc, ie: \"fifty years\". I am only concerned with how our cells divide and bodies age. Not the \"time\" as in \"what physicists define time as\", just the laypersons idea of what time is. ie: how many rotations of the earth, how many revolutions around the sun etc. \n\nImagine \"you\" and \"I\" are identical twins. Same in every way. Practically clones of each other. For my comment, you remain on earth, and I shoot off into the depths of space at near light speed. On earth your body undergoes constant metabolic processes on a cellular level. Your cells will divide at certain intervals and the new cells aren't quite as good in quality as the previous ones... This is why we age over time. We simply are copied too much (on a cell level) like making a copy of a copy of a copy etc with a tape. At some point it simply is inaudible anymore and nothing like the master copy was. We get old. Now if you and I did this at the same rate and were the same physical age as far as our bodies are concerned while we are both on earth, we will look decepid to the same degree as the other.\n\nNow if I (flying off into space at near light speed) perceive time and experience time slower, would my cells be aging at the same rate regardless of the speed im traveling. Would my cells divide and do their metabolic processes etc slower. Not talking about 'perception' but the actual cells in actuality. So after fifty years, the you on earth look fifty because your cells have been dividing at that rate we would divide at etc. After fifty years (by the earth reckoning) of flying through space and perceiving time has my (in space) body aged to appear fifty as my cells still do their thing at the same rate. Or am I doing my metabolic stuff slower and thus look less than fifty. So when by the time I return to earth, has my body divided the same number of times as your body has and thus look like you who has never left, or am I still looking younger as if my cells were dividing slower etc. Does it affect how my body ages/cells work/cells divide/breaks down etc, regardless of 'time'. And if I were to return to earth and I'm now drastically younger than you as far as my bodies stage of its life  is concerned, (ie I'm still looking and cells are younger than you, and your body is looking drastically older than mine)... How would moving fast (near light speed) affect how cells work and divide?\n\nThank you for any genuine responses. :D",

This system of equations is known as the Napier Unified Theory, and it consists of three equations. The underlying principles of the theory are based on two main assumptions: that energy is conserved, and that entropy always increases. The variables in the equation are a, b, Λ, G, ρ, k, H, and q.\n\nThe variable a relates to the speed of light, and b is the coefficient of the electromagnetic force. Λ is the cosmological constant, which represents the amount of energy in the universe. G is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of gravity. ρ is the mass density of the universe, and k is the Boltzmann constant, which describes the most probable distribution of energy. H is the Hubble constant, which measures the expansion rate of the universe, and q is the electric charge.\n\nThese variables are related in the following ways: the speed of light is governed by a and b, the cosmological constant is determined by Λ and G, the mass density is described by ρ and k, and the electric charge is determined by q and H. Additionally, the equations of the theory are related to physical and astronomical phenomena, such as the rate of expansion of the universe, the structure of the universe, and the behavior of light.\n\nE = R + Λ(a - b) + (8π G/3)ρ + (1/3)Λ - k/a2 + aH(1 - q)",

Also, time is a actually relative phenomenon. The only physical intuition I have been able to come is that time is just a phenomenon experienced through the effect of energy reaching potential equilibrium. Even our own thoughts may be explained by this. The firing of neurons in the brain may be attributed to voltage changes throughout the brain, which again is potential equilibrium. Provided this intuition holds any merit, what does this say about time? Is a system where in which all energy is in perfect equilibrium, absent of time? Will the universe eventually reach this state, thus ending time forever? This may be more philosophical, but I want to discuss with the physics community to explore if this intuition even holds physical merit, before a philosophical discussion may be held.",
