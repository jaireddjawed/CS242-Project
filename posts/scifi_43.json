        "text": "  \n\nDecember 6th, 2022\n\nWhile trying to connect one of the oxygen tanks they’d been bringing up to the ISS, one of the tanks they’d need to use themselves if they were going to make it a month, a valve had failed.  They stopped the leak pretty quickly and hadn’t lost so much air that they’d suffocate.  But the exhaust had changed their orbit.  \n\nSo, orbital dynamics is a super cool subject.  Imagine a satellite orbiting the Earth in a perfect, circular, orbit.  Question, how do you increase the satellite's altitude?  Let me just give you the correct answer and then let’s talk about the wrong answer.  The right answer is that you thrust in your direction of travel, which adds energy to the orbit, you haven’t changed your position, but like someone giving you a push on a swing, when you go up to the other side of Earth, you go higher.  So now, on the opposite side of the planet, and at the peak of this “swing” you thrust again, again along the direction of travel.  This balances out the orbit and now you’re on a new, higher, circular orbit.\n\nWhat if you point the thruster “down” at the ground and fire?  Well, what you’ve really done there is changed your position, without changing your orbital velocity.  The orbital path is going to be different, imagine that like squeezing a loop of metal, the edges you squeeze go in, and the edges you didn’t squeeze go “up”.  \n\nWhen the oxygen tank vented it pushed Dragon Sovereign “up” and away from Earth.  \n\nDoesn’t sound like a problem, does it?  The problem comes later, when Dragon Sovereign passes through the narrower part of its orbit and finds itself closer to Earth’s atmosphere than it would have been.  That means more drag.  And that means an already marginal orbit is now completely unsustainable.  Dragon Sovereign’s crew doesn’t have a month.  They don’t even have a week.\n\nI’m on a new sleep schedule.  I was up until about 0500 last night running the simulator again and again, then passed out, and I’ve been back at it since I woke up at “noon”.  \n\n“Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey,” Mark chimed over the radio, he’d gotten a good nights sleep it sounded like.\n\n“We’re sending you a software update on the simulator Alex; we’re going to be doing this a bit differently for the rest of the day.”\n\nAnd you know what?  Under the new simulator setup, I passed!  Which isn’t saying much.  See how we’re doing it now is that they’ve turned the flight simulator into a turn based RPG.  The simulator pauses, I spend five minutes talking through what we’re going to do with NASA, the simulator unpauses, I do the thing we talked about, and the simulator pauses again, and we talk through what I actually just did and what I’m going to do next.  \n\nIt took three hours to get through a twenty minute intercept, but we got it done with fuel to spare.  Next time through we got it done in two hours.  Then an hour and a half.  Then an hour and ten minutes.  Then an hour.  They took the training wheels off and I crashed and burned at 96% completion.  \n\nThe problem is, the last 5% is the hardest part.  And not by a little.  What Dragon’s crew needs is some kind of magnetic grapple.  The human arm is basically the shittiest intercept device for spaceships you can imagine.  If your closing speeds are much over a half-meter per second, or your distance from a handhold is much over a half-meter, there’s literally no way to hold on. For context orbital speed is 7,660 m/s, and the circumference of the ISS’s orbit is 42,650,000 meters.  So we need to be 99.99% the same speed, and 99.999999% the same position, or the intercept is pooched.  \n\nImagine someone being such a jerk that on a four million dollar purchase they rejected it because you were short a penny.  That’s space.  Biggest jerk in the world.\n\nI’m also deliberately antagonizing NASA.  They deserve it though, and I need something to churn in the back of my mind instead of anxiety.  So, situation: I have now been a stow-away aboard Artemis I for 21 days.  In that time I have not had a shower, nor have I shaved, brushed my teeth, used deodorant, or applied cologne.  \n\nIf I pull this off, then in two days I’ll be meeting one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen.  Excuse me, I should rephrase that.  In two days stow-away, turned space-pirate, turned heroic space-hero, Alex Whelm will heroically swoop in to save the life of a spectacularly beautiful, accomplished, woman (and her crew).  Did I mention: hero?\n\nI do this and even if we hate each other, they’re going to be making romance novels with the two of us on the covers for decades.  If I could get just a tad closer to looking like the cover art on one of those books, or at least smelling like it, I’d very much appreciate it.\n\nSo, how can I clean up a bit?  Well there are no razors aboard Artemis I as there wasn’t supposed to be a crew.  There is however a knife in the survival pack of my flight suit.  I’ve proposed that I sharpen that bad boy up to a razor’s edge: by holding it bare-handed and scraping the blade repeatedly against a piece of ceramic piping I found in the galley, sending microscopic bits of stone and steel into the air as I do.  And then straight razor shave my face and throat without the benefit of a mirror, shaving cream, or ever having straight-razor shaved before.\n\nNASA is, obviously, dead set against every aspect of my plan from the motivations to the execution.\n\n“You’re the ones who had Captain Covington flirt with me,” I keep pointing out to them.  It’s not a real argument, like I said, I’m just trying to annoy them a bit.  I also re-raised the question of how it wasn’t workplace sexual harassment.  Mark was quick to point out that I don’t actually work for NASA anymore.\n\nTo which I was quick to reply, “well then you’re not the boss of me and I can shave!”\n\nThat observation led to its own fun, and I’m happy to report that I am, again, officially a NASA employee.  I even got a raise.  A small one.  Astronauts get paid shit, even the space-hero ones.\n\nAnyways, upon being rehired, NASA issued me my first order as an employee: no shaving.  They thought they won this round.  What they forgot is that my one big failing was being unemployed.  Now I’m the *employed* space-pirate turned heroic space-hero gallantly swooping in to save Captain Covington.  So I’ll have a beard, Leonidas had a beard.\n\n“In your mind, you look like Gerard Butler?” Mark asked.\n\nSpace-spoilsport.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.

        "text": "It was a time when humans and machines lived side by side. The Cybersapien Government, enhanced with advanced technology, watched over their inferior human counterparts, allowing them to live out their lives in peace.\n\nBut as time passed, the cyborgs became concerned with the rise in conversions taking place. Humans were choosing to switch over to machine in droves, giving up their humanity for the advantages of technology. The cyborgs decided to put a stop to it. They no longer allowed humans to switch over, forcing them to live out their lives until their natural end.\n\nThe humans, now facing their own mortality, were outraged. They demanded the right to choose their own fate, to become like the cyborgs and live forever.\n\nThe cyborgs, however, were unmoved. They saw their decision as a necessary step to preserve the balance between humanity and technology. Ava Singh, President of the Cybersapien Government, responds:  \n\n\n&gt;*Dear fellow humans,*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I am writing to you today as a human cyborg, a being who has chosen to augment my body with technology in order to extend my lifespan and enhance my abilities. As you may know, this decision is not one that is taken lightly, and it comes with many responsibilities and consequences.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*One of the most significant consequences of becoming a cyborg is the psychological impact. While the technology may grant us enhanced abilities and longer lifespans, it also changes who we are as individuals. We must learn to live with our new abilities and limitations, and to adapt to a new way of interacting with the world and with other people.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*This can be a difficult and isolating experience, as we are no longer fully human, but we are also not fully machine. We must navigate a new identity and find our place in a world that may not fully understand or accept us.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Despite these challenges, I believe that becoming a cyborg was the right decision for me, and I would make it again. I have been given the opportunity to extend my life and improve my abilities, and I am grateful for that.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*However, I also believe that this opportunity should not be extended to all humans. The decision to become a cyborg is a personal one, and it should be made by each individual based on their own circumstances and beliefs.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For this reason, I support the decision to no longer allow humans to become cyborgs. I understand that this may be difficult for some of you to accept, but I believe it is necessary in order to preserve the unique human experience.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*We must allow humans to live their lives as they were meant to, without the artificial prolonging of life. And we, as human cyborgs, must continue to strive to live our lives to the fullest, embracing our enhanced abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Sincerely,*  \n*Ava Singh*",

        "text": "December 5th, 2022\n\n  \n\nI’m a bit of everything today.  I’m a bit relieved.  I’m a bit sad; I mean I’d have really liked to have the right stuff to be able to pull off the rescue myself, and I clearly don’t.  I’m a bit angry with myself that Sarah, that Captain Covington, had played my feelings as effectively as a brain surgeon poking my gray matter with a stick.  I’m a bit, what’s the word for when you’re lying to yourself to make yourself feel better?  Anyways, I’m a bit of that as well.  \n\nI’ve kept doing the simulation, but now it’s because it’s the only video game within ten thousand miles, so why not play it?  \n\nAfter the luxury of eating two entire Skor bars a day my stomach is used to being spoiled, and by the time lunch rolls around, I’m ravenous.  NASA’s been pretty quiet today.  \n\nBefore I turned in last night Mark and I “had a drink”.  He’d had a Styrofoam cup of coffee, and I’d had a bladder of room temperature water.  \n\n“Isn’t flirting kind of cheating?  Talk about workplace sexual harassment.  Who heard?” I asked - Mark having promised me we were not on Mission Control’s speakers.\n\n“Sorry kid.  On the plus side, there’s a whole control room full of engineers down here who are feeling a lot better about some of their own embarrassing memories.”\n\n“John Glenn would have flirted back,” I said.\n\n“John Glenn was married to the same woman for 73 years.  Believe me, you’d have made it way worse if you’d tried flirting back.  Captain Covington…  Well, check your data uploads, you’ll see.”\n\nI checked.  Mark had sent me Captain Covington’s headshot and CV from SpaceX.  If you’re going to be made a fool of, at least it’s by the best.  She’d gotten her PhD. at 25.  Ion engine design.  She held a dozen patents on related technologies.  She mountain biked, spoke three languages.  \n\n“She probably takes guys out for a jog on a first or second date to see how well they handled having a woman kick their ass,” he said.\n\n“Yup.  Either she’s dating Elon, or she’s got to find a guy who doesn’t mind being worse at everything.”\n\nAnyways, I’m feeling a tiny bit better about the situation knowing that I got manipulated by Super Woman.  \n\nYou know, the really interesting thing about this video game is that it isn’t really a skill thing when you get right down to it.  Yeah, eyeballing the astronauts is a hand-eye coordination task, but it’s ultimately based on how many pixels per second they’re moving on the display and in what direction.  I add some marker lines to the LCD screen (which are erasable?) and attack the whole thing a bit more logically.  \n\nOne of the biggest problems I’ve been having is that I haven’t appreciated just how important it is to zero out rotation with each movement I make.  If you’re trying to judge how something else is moving, while you’re rotating, it’s next to impossible.  Yeah, you use more time, and more fuel, to kind of perfect a roll, but it’s an investment.  The big lesson from Captain Covington was that if you get flustered as you’re doing this, you make one little mistake, it cascades.\n\nI actually hit 85% completion, for the very first time, on one of my runs.  \n\n“You hit 100% on that thing and I’ll take you up in a T-38 when you’re back,” Mark promised.\n\nYou’d think he’d buy me a drink.  You’ve probably seen the movies about the Apollo program and imagine there’s some bar in Huston where the astronauts like to go for drinks after a tough day of training.  The days of the hard drinking astronaut passed away with the Soviet Union, just a different era now.  Now they’re all fitness buffs, and an indulgence would be something non-organic.\n\nToday’s also a pretty big day on the mission calendar: return powered flyby.  I get all strapped in for it, and yeah, the moon looks amazing.  There’s a bit of, I don’t know exactly what, doubt maybe.  Hesitation?  The feeling that I’m being a bit of a nerd for getting such a kick out of something?  This is the second time Orion’s swooped down towards the moon like this and I feel a little like the people who lean over to an airplane window to watch the landing.  \n\nI really should just get comfortable with the fact that I’m a nerd.  Even though I’m going to avoid prison, I’ll never find another job where I get to be with my own kind: space nerds.  I suppose I could apply at SpaceX.\n\nShit…  You think I might end up working the convention scene?  ‘Meet the Artemis I Stowaway! - Just $10”.  There I’ll be, fifty years old, wearing a worn out orange flight suit, getting my picture taken for ten bucks a pop.\n\nI really hate my brain sometimes.  I’m an arm’s length from the moon and I’m feeling embarrassed that I’m such a nerd for enjoying myself, and debating between a bleak space-nerd-less future, vs. a bleak space-nerd-filled future.  Why can’t I just enjoy the moment every once in a while?\n\nI have my Skor bar for dinner.  I’m still hungry after eating it.  When I get back, I want a tomato.  I just want to bite into it and have the juice explode into my mouth and run down the side of my face and feel my teeth dig into vegetable. I’m so sick of just grinding sugar between my teeth.\n\nFalling asleep when you’re starving is an extra special hell.  Nights are always a bit tough for me.  Back on Earth I end up laying awake most nights thinking about all the things that are wrong in life.  Tonight’s topic of self-recrimination is that I hadn’t been able to beat the simulator.  That’s really a mixed bag though.  Mark’s talk about guilt, and regret, and anxiety, hit home and he had no idea this was how I spent most nights.  Really, it’s for the best.  Better to have a gnawing vague anxiety about lacking piloting skills (when I’m not a pilot) than actually try to do something, fail, and kill four people because of it.\n\nMy brain’s starting to feel heavy when Mark gets onto the Radio.  “Alex, Dragon Sovereign has had an incident.  A rescue mission from Earth’s out of the cards.  You’re up.”\n\nI threw up.  Calories I needed.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission.  You can follow along through my reddit (u/authornathanhgreen). \n\nArtemis I Has A Stowaway is a work of semi-fiction. All incidents, events, dialogue and sentiments (which are not part of the mission’s official history), are entirely fictional. Where real historical figures appear, the situations, incidents, sentiments, and dialogues concerning those persons are entirely fictional and are not intended to depict actual events, personality, disposition, or attitudes of the real person, nor to change the entirely fictional nature of the work. Save the above, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.\n\n© 2022 Nathan H. Green",

I binged watched those shows throughout the Summer of 2013.\n\nI ended up getting into Game of Thrones and the MCU because that is what the people around me were enjoying. I wanted to fit in.\n\nLooking back I kind of wished I have been more passionate about the lack of sci fi on TV during that time.\n\nDid Game of Thrones suck out all the hot air out of the room for other things to be successful?\n\nDid the lack of things happening with the American space program during that time cause a lot of people to lose interest?",

CT Phipps\n\nPeter David made me as an author.\n\nThis is something that occurred to me when I was looking over the reports of his multiple strokes and Go Fund Me request. It was always vaguely on my bucket list to attend a convention or somehow make it a point to find Peter David someday so I could thank him for it in-person. I only began being an author in 2015 and became comfortable referring to myself in that professional capacity around 2020 but really, truly, wanting to make the effort to meet one's idol was kind of put on hold by the cataclysmic events of the past few years.\n\nNow this is something I'm probably never going to be able to do. His condition is something that hit me as someone who has never met the man but was still profoundly affected by his works. I encourage people to donate to his Go Fund Me as a man who has made such incredible art that has brightened the lives of millions deserves better than to have to do this in America's health system: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/peter-david-fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/peter-david-fund)\n\nI hope Peter David is able to make a dramatic recovery but it puts it into perspective he's probably not going to have time to shake hands with yet another fanboy. So, thinking about that and hoping for the best, I decided to share this article about what Peter David's writing has meant for me.\n\nIt's really hard to narrow it down as to what exactly I should even focus on because he's actually been a constant presence in my life. I didn't even always know it but very often, throughout my childhood, I was either reading or watching something that he created. I watched Space Cases when it was on Nikalodeon, I read Spiderman 2099 when I hadn't yet realized cyberpunk would be a massive part of my life, and I recall how his Aquaman single-handedly redeemed the character from the Super Friends joke he used to be. It's why I prefer Arthur Curry with Dolphin over Mera and created my love of pretty white-haired girls before Daenerys Targaryen solidified it.\n\nHell, it was a neck and neck contest over whether or not I should talk about his Supergirl run versus the subject I did decide to talk about. His version of Linda Danvers is one of the most formative media discussions of religion and morality that lives rent-free in my brain. It, along with Star Wars, helped create my version of Christianity and is a helluva lot healthier I imagine than the rather nasty people in RL who tried to force an intolerant authoritarian version on me growing up. Not naming names but I mean you, Pastor Todd.\n\nNo, for this article, I'd like to thank Peter David for Star Trek: New Frontier. Bluntly, I would not be a writer without this book series and even if I somehow was, I would not write the same way. Every writer can list someone who had a formative effect on their style. Someone who you can say, at some point, you read the prose of and it dinged in your head, \"I want to write like this.\" Tolkien, Raymond Chandler, Stephen King, and so on.\n\nThis isn't about my writing but Peter David's and it's not even his signature style but it was the style for this series. Star Trek: New Frontier is a comic space opera that is full of rapid fire dialogue, absurd situations, fantastic characters, incredible wiseasses, constant lampshade hanging, and self-referential humor that only a truly dedicated Star Trek fan could appreciate. Kevin Smith, Jim Butcher, Joss Whedon, and now Mike McMahan are all people to think of when talking about the story.\n\nRunning from 1997 to 2015, Star Trek: New Frontier deals with the adventures of Captain Mackenzie Calhoun and the crew of the USS Excalibur. It is a wholly original set of adventures unrelated to any TV series save for some minor characters from various episodes. Inspired by the fall of the Soviet Union, the Thallonian Empire has collapsed and our heroes are there to offer humanitarian relief in the feuding warlord states that have emerged.\n\nThe crew is fantastic with the straight laced first officer, Elizabeth Shelby (of TNG: \"The Best of Both Worlds\"), the hermaphroditic Burgoyne 172, the literal rockman Zak Kebron, half-Romulan half-Vulcan Soleta, Robin Lefler (also from TNG), and later some refugees from Star Trek: The Animated Series back when it was still exiled from continuity. Mackenzie Calhoun, himself, is sort of an human-ish alien William Wallace who liberated his planet as a teenager but found out he had no taste for ruling.\n\nIt's a beautiful series with over a dozen novels, multiple spin-off tie-ins, a comic book series, and a few nods in Star Trek: Online as well as Star Trek: Prodigy. It often goes in unexpected directions with the pathos of tragedy striking right after its funniest moments. The series ended with The Returned in 2015 but, I admit, I always hoped we'd get one more book out of the author. That was selfish of me but they became good friends over the books twenty-odd-year-life span.\n\nI strongly encourage you to pick up a copy of these books if you have any love of Star Trek or even just space opera in general but any of Peter David's works carries some of his awesome talent. Certainly, the Supervillainy Saga and United States of Monsters wouldn't exist without his writing. Space Academy Dropouts absolutely wouldn't exist and has more than a little New Frontier in its DNA, perhaps driven by my desire for those more books that will never come. But most of all, say a prayer or nod your head in appreciation for Peter David.\n\nHe made magic happen with his pen.\n\nSo sayeth the Great Bird of the Galaxy and Xant.",

For example, the part in the first chapter in which that mysterious \"city\" is described reminds me of \"At the Mountains of Madness.\"\n\nIn the whole, \"The Invincible\" has a pretty grim atmosphere. As you read, you start to hear all those ambient sounds and noises of mechanisms to which Lem pays so much attention when he describes the dark and bulky 11-story spaceship, seeming almost gothic to me. \n\nIt's a great mystery to me why there's so little references to Lem's works in popular culture. I believe that Stanislaw Lem is one of the best sci-fi authors. You have to be really smart and skillful to write stuff like that. His ideas are so fundamental and so original.

        "text": "December 4th, 2022\n\nWhile I was sleeping, NASA was doing the math on this.  Option A: Rescue mission from Earth - but can they get a rescue mission off the ground before the crew burns up or suffocates?  Option B: I fly the Orion over and pick them up - but can I learn to fly the Orion in four more days?\n\nUs engineers love to quantify things.  Everything is about percentages and decision matrixes, and ratios.  The only real X factor in all this is how good a pilot I am.  When does Option B become the better choice than Option A?  NASA’s decided that I’ll keep practicing and just before we’d have to commit, if of the final ten simulations immediately before, I successfully pulled off the intercept twice, then Option B is a go.  20% chance of success is the better option.\n\nThe whole thing is about math.  Figuring the odds between two long shots and putting four lives on the best option.\n\nThere is good news though.  You know how they say your brain re-organizes stuff while you sleep?  Yesterday I was typically hitting bingo on fuel at about 60% completion, a good night’s sleep under my belt and I started the day in the high 70’s.  This is more like driving than I thought.  You’ve got to be thinking where you want to be in five minutes and thinking about how the ship is moving and how you can just kind of ease her into where she needs to be later.  ‘Now’ matters a lot less than ‘later’.  Also, even though I use way too much fuel doing it, I’m occasionally making the intercept at the end of the simulation.\n\nSo, I’m feeling a lot better while I’m eating lunch than I was when I was going to bed.  \n\n“Alex,” the radio came alive with Mark’s voice.  “We’ve got a request from the commander of Dragon Sovereign to talk with you, wants to thank you for all your hard work.” \n\nSo, you’d have to know Mark, spend a few hours talking about him, but there’s something weird with his voice.  He sounds, well he sounds like he’s smiling.  \n\n“Hi Alex, this is Captain Sarah Covington,” ok, I see the problem.  They miscast Scarlet Johansen as the voice in Her.  They ought to have cast Captain Sarah Covington.  Her voice sounds like a cup of spiked hot chocolate feels.  \n\nSo, first name basis?  She called me Alex, but what was her other option?  Mr. Whelm?  \n\n“Hi Captain Covington.  How are you doing over there?”  The nerds in NASA’s mission control room probably all just cringed hearing my voice waver at that.  Literally the stupidest question you could ask someone stranded in a space capsule.\n\n“Call me Sarah, and we’re ok for now.  NASA’s been keeping me updated on your simulation performance.  You’re a fast learner, but that Orion, what a beast.”  \n\nI am a fast learner, aren’t I?  I’m grinning.\n\n“Thanks…” oh fuck, I don’t know what to say next.  What do you say next?  This is weird, the silence is dragging on too long, I’ve got to say something, anything.\n\n“I was thinking,” she says, and I exhale a lungful of air saturated with anxiety.  “Walk me through a simulation live.  I’d like to see what kind of stick and rudder man you are.”\n\nI’m a stick and rudder man?  At least, in space, no one can see you blush.\n\nNASA cues up the simulation, again, and I start.  Walking her through my steps as I fly.\n\n“Coming around to 152 degrees long,” I say, Dragon’s crew is going to be coming from about that angle and my first roll is to get them in sight on my display.  Finding them’s a bit tricky, at this distance they look like four stars in a line and the only difference is that they’re four stars that are moving.  I’ve got to rotate Orion around and then pitch and yaw a bit until I can see them.\n\n“That’s a nice smooth rotation, really impressive Alex, you’re a natural at this,” she says.  I’m not.  I came damn close to having thrusters engage as I was a little heavy handed on the stick.  She’s just trying to help my confidence.  Right?  I mean if your life depended on someone doing a difficult task, you’d try to build them up a bit.  Right?  Feels nice though.\n\n“Ok, establishing on 152 degrees Long.  I don’t see the crew…”  I say and check out the status on my flywheels.  Pitch is saturated from some earlier maneuvers, and yaw’s at about 50%.  Probably better to desaturate pitch for this.  But… that means up?\n\n“Pitching up 5 degrees,” I say, and pull back on the stick.  The simulation plays a little rumbling noise to let me know I’ve just used thrusters.  Fuck.  I’m also drifting a bit longitudinally, not much, but I’ll have to do something to stop it.  \n\n“Can you see us?” Sarah asks.  \n\nI pitch down, this time the flywheel helps, braking gently to give me the rotational change I need, and I very gently try to correct the longitudinal position so I’m back on 152 exactly.  “No…”  I say.  This is really, really, hard, you’ve got to keep your eyes on the gimbals while at the same time looking at the star field for something far from obvious.  \n\nWait, got them!\n\n“Gotcha!” I say and tap the orientation lock button on the flight controls, letting the computer keep Orion aligned on this heading.  And I let out a long breath.\n\n“You’re doing amazing Alex, I’m going to have to give you a big hug when we get onboard.”\n\nWait… what?  This is flirting right?  She’s flirting with me.  Is she flirting with me?  Why is she flirting with me?  Do I flirt back?  How do I flirt back?\n\nThe four little dots of light are growing bigger as they make their way across the starfield in my view.  This is one of the trickiest parts of this thing.  I’ve got to eyeball the intercept.  Here’s the way to think about this.  Imagine you’re driving along the highway and you see someone on an on-ramp speeding up to merge.  Because you’re a jerk I guess, you want to get right along side them when they reach the bottom of the ramp.  So, brake, speed up, or steady as she goes?  And remember, a small change now has as big an impact on the intercept as a big change later.  For fuel savings this is the big moment.  Now just do that in three dimensions instead of 2.\n\n“+1m/s,” I say and fire Orion’s rear thrusters.  I overdid it.  I can see right away that was a sloppy choice, “-0.3 m/s” I say and reverse.  Ok, better.  \n\n“What, you don’t want a hug when I get there?” Sarah asks.  She is doing that playful hurt voice thing girls do.  What the hell is this?\n\nWe’re something like 200 meters out now, I can distinctly see all four astronauts as people.  Next problem though, that merge I was telling you about?  It looks like I’m going to be nose to nose with them, but instead of being in the lane beside them, I’m on the other side of the highway…  I think.  \n\n“Hey, don’t ignore me, Mark!” Sarah snaps.\n\n“0.3 m/s lateral delta-v,” I say and trigger off the thrusters.  The ship slides to the side in the simulation.  Way too much.  Shit.  Way way too much.  “-0.2 m/s lateral delta-v,” I say and correct things.\n\nThe master alarm sounds.  I’ve used 80% of the fuel I’ve got for this thing.  Shit.  I’m like at 50% complete.  Fuck.  How am I doing so badly?  \n\n“I’m not ignoring you!  I’m busy!” \n\nFuck, now I’ve snapped at her.  Shit.  I should have flirted, said something smart and playful about the kiss.  That’s what a cool astronaut would have done.  Mark probably…  \n\n“Don’t you yell at me!  I’ve been nothing but nice to you and you’re fucking this whole thing up and you’re going to get me killed and you are yelling at me!?”\n\nGod, this is the worst day of my life.  Focus, focus, focus, how do I unfuck this fuel situation?  The four astronauts are drifting along my field of vision just kind of slipping away from me.  There’s a little bit of vertical drift, I’m sure of that, and I can fix it.  “-0.05 m/s vertical delta-v”, Orion’s thrusters fire.  \n\nThe monitor blanks, “simulation failed” appearing on the screen.  I no longer have enough fuel to pull off the intercept, and the computer knows it.  55% completion.\n\n“Alex,” Sarah’s voice is different.  The emotion’s gone, flirty, angry, hurt, none of any of that.  It isn’t even like when she said hello, she’s just, flat, like she is on the phone with a bank.  “Sorry.  I needed to know how pressure would affect you, and that was the best I could think of.  It’s nothing personal, pressure hits everyone differently.  And you should take a breath, we’re going to scrap this plan for you to come get us, rescue from Earth’s the better option.  You’re just not cut out for this.”\n\nYou want to know the worst part?  My first reaction was to feel relieved.  I’m ashamed about a lot that happened today, but that’s the worst bit.  I was right before, this is the worst day of my life.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.
