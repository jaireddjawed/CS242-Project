I've learned that there are an innumerable amount of sexual practices that exist between consenting adults. I was taught to employ a patient centered approach to sexual health education/treatment even if the patient was a porn actor/ess, sex worker, stripper, cam girl etc. As a future physician, I've learned that my role is to educate patients on safe practices and offer indicated screenings and medications. \n\nSo, why is it considered professional for medical students to be sex workers or for doctors to have worked in sex work prior to their medical career? \n\nI understand physicians are \"held to a higher standard.\" I do. \n\nHowever, I don't understand how we can tell our patients who do sex work that we accept them and then categorize sex work/a history of sex work in our MS/Dr. colleagues as unprofessional because we are \"held to a higher standard.\" \n\nWhat the heck does it even mean to be held to a higher standard? I don't think that engaging in or abstaining from sex work should be any part of characterizing/evaluating the acumen, competency, or \"standard\" of a medical student.",

        "text": "hey yall I have just started my clinical rotations in my final 2 years of medical school, and I just had some questions to make sure im not going insane. I just started my rotations so im new to all of this.\n\n1) is it normal for supervising physicians to only point out things you missed and never really \"validate\" things you did right? how do you get used to this?\n\n2) In the ER, I always feel a lot of pressure to speed up interviews because I want the patient to be seen by the physician as soon as possible. I can't help but feel like im holding them back a bit, because I need time to review their chart, get a thorough history, think about ddx/investigations, etc. is there any way to get around this kind of anxiety\n\n3) sometimes I feel so utterly useless in the hospital. and I know I am, but I think this affecting me, because I feel like im just taking up space and im not supposed to be there. I also find it hard to not consider myself a burden to the supervising physician, and how to have fun with it when I feel like Im such a nuisance. \n\n4) I find that I get overwhelmed by the amount of content I need to study every day and I get in a sort of paralyzed state where I don't even know where to begin or what to do. How do you guys figure out what is \"high yield\" to study while on rotations?\n\n5) is there any advice you guys have for doing well on certain rotations? im interested in internal medicine and pediatrics, I really want to avoid getting in my own head for these rotations. how do you know what to study, when there's so much you could potentially see every day? how do you make yourself as useful as possible? how do you make yourself seem smart and competent (lol)? how do you \"keen\" without being annoying?\n\nguys I know this sounds super dumb and naive but I honestly have no idea what im doing at all. im so lost all the time and the imposter syndrome is so real. I feel like I am never doing anything right, and half the time I really don't know what im doing. I know the patients tend to really like me, which is kind of what ive been holding on to and what's been getting me through. but I need to get my supervisors to like me too!!! and I feel like they haven't been a fan so far. I don;'t know a lot of people in my class so I feel pretty alone in all of this, and there's no physicians in my family, so this is all just new territory to me.",

        "text": "Sorry folks, I just need to vent a little and don't have too many people that I can lay my struggles on who get it. \n\nComing in to med school I had a pretty clear vision of residency and beyond. Nothing too competitive -- primary care -- and there was even a residency program I'd  have been happy at less than 10 minutes from my home.  Everything looked great, and even with a slight change in specialty I still had some good options, strong home state ties, and an attending who offered unprompted during my rotation to call his home program to put in a good word for me as he \"was always happy to recommend to them a strong candidate\".  Everything was coming up Millhouse.  \n\nFast forward to about a 8 months ago, funding for my wife's position ran out and, due to COVID and her boomer PI holding out for a golden parachute buyout instead of just retiring, she had to find a new position. She's a rock star, so had a lot of options, but nothing near our home.  I adore her and am going to support her career that she's worked far harder at than anything I've ever done, so I told her to go where she'd be most fulfilled and set up for future success.  That ended up being 14 hours away in a city with only 2 residencies within a 2-3 hour radius (one of them a top-10 I stood no chance at)\n\nI did the best to unlock the region with aways, but VSLO was basically done by that point.  I had to burn all of my program and regional signals on the handful of programs within 5 hours of her.  Frustratingly I got good response from the home region programs I applied to as backup, but only 2/5 for programs I signaled.  I was really happy that I did get an interview with the one program I needed, absolutely demolished it, and just got a love letter from them yesterday.  \n\nOf course, about 3 weeks ago she heard from a former labmate that a position is opening up. Her PI  is a misogynistic old narcissist, so even though she's incredibly qualified, he's going to try and push through a male candidate who will continue to publish the PIs garbage quantity over quality and keep getting his name on papers.  Thankfully she found out today he's not on the search committee so can't outright veto her, but still will have some influence and it's far from a sure thing that she'd manage to get this spot.  Even if she applied it'll probably be months or more before we'd know anything.   Unfortunately there just aren't that many spots in her field, so if we ever want to get back to home (where our late 60-70 year old parents are) this may be our only chance for a long time.  \n\nSo here I am, 2 weeks from certifying my match list trying to decide whether I rank her new city #1 and risk being out there completely alone, or rank something close to home and risk her being stuck out there for the next 4 years.  I know she feels guilty about dragging me out there away from our aging parents, and I want to -- and am going to -- support her career  and her being the badass bitch that she is, so I don't really feel like I can discuss it with her without making her feel worse.   Especially on top of 4 years of being 3ish hours apart, it just sucks.  It makes me feel like maybe the universe is just trying to tell us something.",

I understand that for every 6 months I take the stipend, I will serve 1 year. I am wondering if anyone has any insight into what that service looks like. The recruiter I talked to stated it is not your typical 1 weekend a month schedule. He said that we basically set the times we want to do our service. I am also wondering what deployment looks like in the Army Reserves.\n\nLastly, and probably the most important, how is being in the reserves or national guard viewed by residency programs?\n\nThanks for the help",

Specifically, the OB part, and I really do have a passion for women's reproductive health. I did like the quick procedures (IUD, etc.); however, I knew I did not like the surgeries too much.\n\nThen I went into Pediatrics, and I absolutely loved it as well. I was excited to go in every day, and I have always loved working with kids. I also would like to do a fellowship after. But I heard there are no procedures in Peds? Is this correct?\n\nI know family medicine residency can be a good way to include both groups.\n\nI would like to return to the midwest for residency. So I would love to hear from FM in the midwest.\n\nWill OB be an option for me in FM in the midwest? I hear mixed reviews usually about how patients will prefer an OBGYN, which is understandable in high-risk cases. But doing OB is one of the reasons I would go into FM. Will I be able to center my practice on women and children right away? I cannot see myself not having pediatric patients. Will I have to do a fellowship after FM residency to see both groups of patients?\n\nThank you for your help and direction.",

He brings up to use Examine.com which I find funny because the supplements he claims to use and the studies he recommends are not high quality and have many problems. And even examine.com points this out. Use his website to see what he says about Omega 3 fatty acid for example. Besides Triglyercides everything else has a B or lower rating with only slight improvement. \n\nClaiming it prevents mental decline improves symptoms of depression is false.  And he does this thing where I‚Äôve seen these Huberman types where they site studies and post them on their website and if you literally just follow the link and read the study they posted it says the complete opposite of what their saying or gives mixed opinions. The one on depresssion on his website he uses that sends you over to the national library of medicine is completely misleading. He claims it has been proven to help depression then uses the link. Click on it and this is what it says. It mentions known relationship with Omega 3 fatty acid relationships and Connections how people with depression have lower Omega 3. Im sure people with Depression eat less, eat unhealthy. When you get to the actually review of the evidence the study says ‚ÄúThere is a substantial number of studies that show no Efficency of omega 3 fatty acids against depression.‚Äù The study does further say that the ‚ÄúEvidence is highly mixed in other areas as certain studies say no efficiency while others show efficiency ‚Äù. \n\nI did find it strange that this review study concludes by mentioning how they think it‚Äôs because the studies disproving it ‚Äú might ‚Äùbe poor quality. What‚Äôs the point of writing and posting studies claiming to review the evidence and admiting you kind of just glanced over the quality of these studies  and  It shows a certain bias by being one sided and not mentioning why they felt this way and leave it vague. And don‚Äôt say why the ones proving it works are actually better. \n\nThis is just one supplement and one thing on his website. People are going to complain I‚Äôm cherry-picking and no one‚Äôs perfect I‚Äôm not going to write a 30 page essay but he does this on so many things he posts some were very dangerous.",

        "text": "Hey all! I was diagnosed with ADHD at the start of medical school, and starting taking Vyvanse for it which has made my life a lot easier. On my previous final exams, I did not take it on testing day, as I find it somewhat slows down my thinking (or makes me focus on individual questions for longer), and that worked well getting my above-average scores. On the last final I took 2 days ago, though, I decided to take Vyvanse and I felt short on time and rushed by the end, and I ended up scoring below average even though I thought I knew the material very well. I am debating between not taking the medication for future test days or asking for accomodations and using the medicine on test days. However, I think I would feel guilty asking for the latter, as it would give me an advantage over others (1.5x time), and I have previously done well not using the extra time. Have any of you been in a similar situation?",
