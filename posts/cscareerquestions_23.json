The pathfinder internship at EA is a decent example of the sort of thing I'm looking for I've got a couple things working against me though.\n\nFor one, I didn't declare my major in Computer Science until last semester, so I'm a junior with a freshman's knowledge of CS. I'm good at it, but don't have the experience a lot of employers are looking for in a junior. On a similar note, I haven't done much outside of class programming, so I don't have pet projects to share with companies since I'm so new.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for where I could look for internships? I would greatly appreciate it!",

There's one team lead who isn't my direct manager but always finds ways to call me out, and unfortunately, she has the ear of my manager. \nI don't have a great relationship with my manager either - I feel like he thinks I'm an idiot sometimes, even though he has not explicitly said it. He has, in fact, given my recently a fairly good performance review but the vibes I get from him don't seem positive.  \n\n\nThe only reason I'm still sticking around is for the money. But now, I've found an internal position that's also in IT, but as a PM. The money would be even better, and while I'm not sure if I'll love the new role, I'm wondering if the gamble will pay off with a better team.\n\nSo my question is, should I apply for the Project Manager position and start fresh? And do you think I should give my manager a heads up before I apply, since he'll likely get an automated notification email?\n\nI'd love to hear any advice or thoughts you might have. Thanks a ton!",

I've even heard of people going to schools with good co-op programs who decide to instead find work on their own (to avoid co-op fees etc).\n\nI would appreciate if some of you could explain/share the reasoning for either side, and comment on which is the approach you personally agree with more.\n\nI personally get the feeling that co-op is a bigger help when you're first starting out (Y2, maybe Y3), but isn't that necessary once you're nearing the end of your degree?\n\nI'm mainly asking because I've already applied to a decent school with a decent co-op program, which I'm 90% sure will accept me.

Im by no means a good programmer nor am I the one with the most experienced or productive. You might even argue that I'm not a senior and based on my skillset you would be right but based on my responsibilities and general roles in our processes I'd call myself one even if I'm lacking in skill.\n\nThe company has about as many projects as employees running in parallel, usually 3-5 employees dedicated to a project. Some do programming, some build and wire stuff, others figure out industry specific stuff. Projects range in length from a few months up to 2 years. Then there's minimal support involved but it's really am environment where getting things to work and shipping them is usually enough.\n\nMy responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n* Deciding on software requirements and specifications with PMs or clients\n* Creating such software (often alone)\n* For projects with multiple devs or larger scale, my opinion gets weighed very heavily when it comes to architecture or technologies used - I'm the one that usually does most of the system design for these projects (not too many of them but there are a few)\n* I am trying to bring the company into the present. Building a knowledge base, made them switch to git from using a single svn repo with no backups for mass file storage, set up a CI/CD solution that I'm hoping is getting used eventually, trying to introduce the concept of ticketing instead of emails and meetings, trying to create shared libraries and internal tooling, etc\n* I also manage our IT infrastructure but that's pretty minimal and out of the scope of this question\n\nIn the meantime I've gone back to school and am working on finishing my bachelor's in CS, not too many classes left luckily.\n\nThis is my current situation and I have no idea how to move my career forward. I want to be good at what I do. I want the systems I design to work well, I want to write meaningful tests for every small thing I create, I want to be able to mentor my peers who despite sometimes having more experience than me, look up to me as if I had some knowledge they didn't.\n\nI want to be able to meaningfully measure the performance of myself and others, further improve our developer experience and also just maybe write good code because honestly, I have 0 feedback on that. Most of my code is only seen by me, then given to a client in one way or an other.\n\nI just do these things to the best of my ability and I have no feedback on what I do. Maybe I'm great, maybe I'm terrible. How do I even measure that?\n\nI understand that this is a really broad, open ended question but if I knew what I'm looking for, I'd be using a search engine and not asking people with more experience...",

        "text": "Can anyone please help? I'm on the verge of tears right now. I've been applying to jobs non-stop for web development jobs with no luck. I can't think of anything else that I'm doing wrong. Is the job market seriously looking this grim?\n\nSo as the title says, I completed a coding bootcamp in November, and right after graduating, I applied for jobs immediately. From Indeed, to the bootcamp's job boards, ZipRecruiter, Jobot, Monster, and those atrocious Workday application sites. I even resorted to local recruiters and all they could give me were manual labor jobs in factories.\n\nZipRecruiter is a terrible place, all they send me are spam posts for jobs completely unrelated to what I applied. Workday sites I don't even remember the places I applied to because they never email you if you got denied or considered. My bootcamp's job boards send references but I never had any luck with them.\n\nI applied to AT LEAST 4,000+ jobs on Indeed, which is my primary job board. Only 20 interviews, made it to the final round of interviews in 4 of them and never heard back from any of them, and 16 ghosted me. One of the companies played a game on me and made me do their own project that they needed to be done and I realized this too late thinking it was a take-home assignment.\n\nI polished up my resume making sure it's squeaky clean. I have my contact info at the very top of my resume, and I listed my technical skills with Javascript, PHP, IDA, React, Lua and C# on the top of my resume, then my 6 GitHub projects with the GitHub and live site links, then my Bachelor in Business Management under that. This resume also passes ATS, it's a template provided by my bootcamp.\n\nI like to think my portfolio is really unique and good, my projects are things like a MERN GraphQL Google book search engine, AWS to Firebase (and vice-versa) database converter, Express.js Note Taker using Firebase to store data, Roblox Lua code Obfuscator &amp; Deobfuscator on Nodejs, etc. This also includes game revival projects I worked on from Roblox that have over millions of plays.\n\nI'm really passionate about programming, I was part of a team that restored legacy games on Roblox for many years now, but no one wants to take a chance on me in \"actual jobs\". I would've continued restoring old games, but we don't get paid at all which is the main reason why I'm moving away from building Roblox games and onto greener pastures.\n\nIt's just no one is willing to take a chance on me, and these entry-level job postings are ridiculous because many of them on Indeed require 4 years of on-the-job experience. You have to lie on these forms as well or Indeed will automatically deny your application. These companies don't even care about the Roblox games I restored and built over the years. All they want is on-the-job experience, if you don't have that then they won't even consider you.\n\nCan anyone help me please? Any advice and feedback are appreciated...",

        "text": "I graduated last year and got into a company that does graduate software engineer positions that cycle through front-end, backend, DevOps, and QA teams for a year within a 3-month interval. I love the idea since I didn't know which sect of tech I want to work at.\n\nThe way the company's graduate role work is when you're in a team, they give you small tickets to work on, and gradually bigger ones. You also get a dedicated buddy from the team to help you. However, for this team, since everyone's very busy (understandably so, as they're moving most of the services to Kafka) I didn't get one.\n\nCurrently in my 8th month and in the back-end team (after front-end and QA). I'm feeling so lost right now. I feel like I'm really losing my learning potential by getting very simple tickets. I can understand the intricacies when letting a graduate do work for a fast pace team, I'm not denying I will get confused and ask the senior devs to help, but it's just an endless cycle of taking more senior dev's time and me feel guilty afterward.\n\nJust wondering if anyone in the same position as I am can offer some help? Or rather, if you enjoyed your graduate role, how did it work? Because mine clearly doesn't work for this team.",

The recruiter reached out and we scheduled an interview a week after. The interview went well, the interviewers were knowledgeable and seemed professional. Just this morning the recruiter called me and said they wanted to extend an offer. The only reason I'm so skeptical is because the interview process seemed too easy. It was just one phone call and then a 45 minute technical interview were I just had to make a todo list with vanilla JS. And they gave me the offer a day after the interview. I'm not sure if it's too good to be true or not because the job market is bad right now so I'm sketched out at such an easy interview process. I checked everyone I met on LinkedIn and they all seem legit but idk. Has anyone had similar experiences? Thanks!",

I think they are just very introverted and rarely speak. I find that really hard, like not talking all afternoon and they didn't have my equipment ready for me so I was just all day reading some related docs. \n\nThere's definitely some positive aspects to it - my manager is super chill and fun to be around and the pay is good. I can get a cheap lunch in the canteen. The sad thing is that I have no other programmer in my team at all and nobody I really vibe with. The other team members are mechanical engineers who code on the side and I'm basically coming in to clean up the application they built and add a database to it as well as improve visualizations. They are absolutely nice people and have been nice to me, it's just the banter is lacking and I don't know how I can do this day in day out.\n\nI am up for the technical challenge but I had my first day in there and the atmosphere kinda sucks. The company doesn't even pay for coffee and we have to clock in and clock out like factory workers. The room is tiny with everyone right up next to each other and it's just the most dead light I have ever worked in. I'm facing a window but have this fluorescent light right overhead and the clash is insane, it's so surreal. \n\nHow can I ensure this doesn't go wrong?",

        "text": "Hey everyone, so I have a question that I hope I can find some answers or advice here. I'm currently in my second semester of my Computer Science University because I made the wrong choice of going for my business degree after high school at a community college. After a year or so of that, I switched majors to a University and Computer Science instead.\n\nFast forward to today, I essentially have to pay out of pocket for every semester (I'm 21) with the help of my dad. We're doing a payment plan, so each month we both pay half of the required amount. I still have roughly 3-3.5 years if I take 15 credits per semester and I might be able to shave it down to like 2.5 if I can take summer classes as well (assuming I pass all classes first try).\n\nMy cousins recently graduated from a bootcamp but I've heard how competitive it is to find jobs afterwards. Do I suck it up and just continue the University route even though I'm paying for everything? I'm currently doing the Odin Project right now and it's not too bad so far.\n\nI've had 2 internships so far (not programming related, but in the IT field. Mainly servers and such) Any advice?  \n\n\nTLDR; I need to pay for each semester with the help of my dad. Should I do the full-stack/bootcamp route instead and take a break from school? I have 2 internships that are IT related, no programming though. I'm 21 years old and really would like to be finished with school or have a decent job by the age of 23-24. Thanks",

        "text": "I'm currently taking Economics and Computer Science courses at my college, but since CS is such a popular major, there's a good chance I won't be able to get in. I was accepted for Economics and wanted to add CS as a second major, but my only option may be to minor in Computer Programming.\n\nI have taught myself JavaScript, React/React Native, and Python. And I have taken Intro to CS one and two (Java), and C for the Computer Programming minor (or CS major if I get accepted). By the time I graduate, I will also have taken operating systems, data structures and algorithms, and discrete math.\n\nThere is also the option to get a master's in Computer Science if I complete the minor, which I wouldn't mind. If I don't happen to get accepted for Computer Science, would I still have a fair shot at getting a software engineering position with an Economics major and just the CP minor?\n\nIt may be worth noting that my goal is to be a full-stack engineer at a company that isn't in the public sector and instead work to build consumer/enterprise software (like Stripe, Amazon, or Discord). Although I understand that I will probably be limited with how picky I can be here.",

I'm from Kerala, India currently working at a tech company in Bangalore, India. I got this job 2 weeks after my final exam. I am 23\\[M\\]. I'm kinda smart but also kinda lazy.  \n\n\n**What I do currently**  \nMost of the work I do are creating reports using SQL, solve front-end issues in React and back-end issues in Java. Occasionally I get tasked with creating scripts or some bigger projects. Work starts at 9:45 AM and ends around 7:15 PM. I make around 5 Lakhs annually with almost a 4th of that going to rent.  \n\n\n**Why I want to change to Data Science**  \nIn high school I fell in love with Computer Science and Programming. As I was always a nerd and was ranked the highest in my school for CS I thought it would be natural for me to pursue it further. And so I started my B. Tech for CS. While this helped me land this job I feel as if college ruined my love for CS. Before I used to tirelessly try to solve algorithms and create websites. Now I'm stuck in tutorial hell every week. But there was one subject that gave me the old spark. It was an elective for Machine Learning. One thing I love to do is look up stats and graphs of athletes and have read about statisticians who helped earn their companies profit by their analytical problem solving and data models. The ideal job I see for my self right now is someone like that (I would like to work for a sports related organisation that uses stats ex: StatsMuse, OptaSports).  \n\n\nI ask the people who went from Software Developer to Data Analyst or work in that field similar to what I've outlined to give the steps and path they took. What are things that I should learn both from a technical and non-technical standpoint? For the other Indians out there how could I land a job abroad? What is it like to be in said field?",

I've been trying to pivot more into the field, and got super blessed with this job.\n\nI feel like I want to get more away from my Mech E work and deeper into Programming. I want to know what the heck I'm doing. I want to know how to build an incredible system from the ground-up. I can build off a well-done system quite easily. I enjoy networking stuff as well, looking at packets and all that. I don't give a darn about the front-end. I enjoy SQL and interacting with databases. I enjoy solving coding puzzles (algorithms??). So, I think I would enjoy a back-end role. \n\n1. Can people recommend any other roles I should investigate?\n2. I'm not sure where to go from here. See below:\n\nI'm lacking confidence that any learning path I choose will get me where I want to be (self-taught), or if it worth it (bootcamp, master's). I really want to understand CS and have a strong foundational knowledge. I want to feel like I know what I am doing. I have opportunities to do master's programs (local, OCSMS), but that is obviously an enormous undertaking for 2-3 years. And no guarantee that is what I need. A bootcamp could be a quicker journey, but I hear many of them just churn out front-end web developers, and I am not sure that would serve me. I do like the idea of being accountable, and perhaps I could receive some tuition assistance. Of course, pivoting and using industry knowledge in Mech E is always nice, to avoid going 'down the ladder'. But, I don't want to hold onto a career just because I am afraid to lose my career momentum. I only have a few YoE at this point. \n\nI'm currently working through a Udemy Python course, which I find very easy, but it covers basic gaps in my knowledge. I've found so many resources. Leetcode, [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), Github System Design Primer, Github Tech Interview Handbooks... I just don't know what is going to get me where I want to go. Where do I even want to go?!?\n\nI just don't know! Can you guys provide some insight based on what I shared? \n\nThank you!",

So essentially those just graduating and those who have been in the game for 4+ years. \n\nI just passed the 2 year mark at my company and have been applying to a few places but getting no bites. I have a good resume, reviewed by people I trust, but I keep getting rejections emails of how they decided to move on to a better candidate. \n\nFor now I will keep applying, and polishing up on my skills but it kinda sucks. At this right it feels like I have to stay at my company for the next 2-ish years and attempt my luck at the Senior positions.",
