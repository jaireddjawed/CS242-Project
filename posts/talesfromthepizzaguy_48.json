        "text": "I've been doing this job for about a year (best job i ever had) but the other night i finally snapped. Customer order at 11:45pm. we close at 12 for a delivery 8 miles away (right at the edge of our area). I wasnt happy about it but i remembered they tipped decently, so whatever. I get the order made quickly and run out the door. At this time its like 12:05am ive worked 13 hours that day, and ive been stiffed atleast 4 times. I was ready for it to be over with. I get to the house, and some older lady i havent seen before comes out.  I tell her the total $44.30 and she hands me a 50 and a 1 dollar bill. Assuming the rest was the tip i say \"thank you!\" she then says \"my change?\" this confused me i thought why hand me the 1 dollar bill then?... so i give her $6 hoping that she would hand a few back to me.... she then tells me to \"keep the change\" meaning the $0.70! \n I SNAPPED! she went back in the house and i proceeded to let a slurry of obscene language and insults pour from my mouth about her \"generous 70 cents\" as i get back in my car i notice a gathering of people on the deck. All of which heard my furious onslaught. Get back to the store, cash out, and go home. \nNext day go into work and my boss asks me if i was the one who took that delivery. I owned up to it. he looks me dead in the eye and says \"damnit SauceMaster, next time wait till u get out of the fucking driveway to tell a customer to choke and die on the pizza\" then we both laughed.  I took a delivery out there last night they tipped me $10......overall i think they learned a lesson.",

        "text": "I work at a small corporate pizza place right next to a University, next to all of the bars. Because of this, we close early during the weekdays and at 3 am during the weekends, making us the food of choice (and only food too) after the bars close. Though I am not officially a shift manager, I basically act as one during the majority of my shifts.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was the acting-manager for a 4 pm to 3 am closing shift. I had two people coming in at Midnight both carpooling together, one of which wasn't originally on the schedule and was offered $50 to work that shift. He (which we will call John) immediately went to the back to do dishes or so he told me. About 10 minutes later, I couldn't find him so I called him, he says he's getting cigarettes from the convenience store across the street. I'm pissed but I can't do anything about it since I have no power beyond the current shift. Long story short, he never comes back from the store. He has another shift with me this week. \n\nIt's 1 am and no other worker picks up their phone who is sober enough to work so I'm stuck with only one coworker, who is barely trained. She can't make pizza and she's a literal bitch to the customers. She's actually about to be fired for it. I can't put her on the makeline, so I do it, but I have to stop literally every other pizza to admonish her for being rude or to fix what she fucked up or who she fucked with. She even asked people to leave without asking me first. She complained about how much she's working, and here I was working a 12 hour shift, with no breaks, and she got 2 cigarette breaks for a 4 hour shift.",

It's become so common that people just say the same stuff every single time, I've found myself programming people to say the wrong thing. At the end of each pizza delivery, I'll usually say something along the lines of \"Have a nice lunch/dinner (depending on time of day)\" as I'm leaving and people will too often call back \"You too!\" as they hurry through the door.\n\nI've got to say, it always puts a huge smile on my face whenever that happens. I'm doing it more and more often now and it's the highlight of my day. People don't realize they are telling me to have a nice lunch, and it's hilarious (in my mind).\n\nYou should try it. I'm serious, start telling people to have a nice [insert meal] and just about everyone will tell you to have one too. I've had a handful of people recognize the mistake, and I'd like to think that most will only realize it after the fact, and have a nice lighthearted chuckle about something so miniscule.\n\nAnyway, just something that I've noticed about american pleasantries that nobody seems to pay enough attention to, so I thought I'd do a post.",

        "text": "So, I've been delivering for a local pizza chain in Northern Ohio for the past year and a half. I've had my fair share of good deliveries and bad deliveries. I've had 30 plus dollar deliveries multiple times, but none will ever top the time about a month ago when I was delivering a pizza about ten minutes away on a Friday night. Now, our delivery range is huge, and I am usually the only driver so I have to be precise and quick on the routes I take, especially when I have 25+ deliveries on a Friday night. But one Friday before the dinner rush, around 3:30, I got the delivery about 10 mins away to an apartment complex I've delivered to dozens of times. The delivery gets done, no special tip, as I'm pulling out of the complex I see a kid around my age (20) in an automatic wheelchair who from what I observed had cerebral palsy picking up trash with a grabber and a bucket. He was struggling really bad to maneuver each hand. So I drove up next to him and asked if he liked pizza, he obviously said yes. So I called my brother who was working in the kitchen and told him to make a large pep pizza. I went and grabbed it and went straight back to this kid.. still picking up trash in the complex. When I came back with the pizza he was so thankful and said \"God bless you\" about 100 times. But I couldn't obviously give him the pizza because his hands were full so I found out where he lived and delivered it to his keepers. When I went to the front door they were confused and said they didn't order a pizza. I told them the story and they literally began to cry. They thanked me and I went on my way. I found out his name, Jeremy, and I've attempted to stay in touch with him as well. Made me feel good! :)",

        "text": "Hey there, former delivery driver and current shift manager here. I had just about the worst shift ever last night. We ran out of room in the oven, several pizzas fell off the oven as they were coming out because we didn't have time to grab them, pizzas got backed up and stuck inside the oven and got burnt to a crisp... then at about 8pm, the freezer, walk-in, and air conditioning all quit working. So it was a pretty stressful night to begin with, and then this lady walked in...\n\nMy front cashier was the only one out of the three I had that was trained on anything other than phones, so I had him trying to run cut table and the fryers at the same time because I was running around trying to keep up with everything and had no time to train two employees. They were attempting to help out with the fryers when this lady walked in, so I went ahead and helped her. She said she was picking up an order and gave me her last name. It was kinda loud and I'm a bit hard of hearing so I asked her to repeat herself and she did, but she sounded annoyed already. I looked for her last name on my screen, but there is a limited character space and if they have a first name on the order, the last name usually gets cut off. So I had an order for Sheila with what could be the first two letters of the last name she gave me, so I asked her if the order was under that name just to clarify. She gave me a dirty look and said her last name again with an attitude. I shrugged it off, gave her her total, and took her payment.\n\nWhen I got back to the counter, she immediately snatched both her card and the pen out of my hand, signed her receipt and started yelling at me for being rude to her and demanding to get our 800 number. Meanwhile, I was just standing there in bewilderment with no clue what had just happened. She kept yelling, and at a certain point told me that \"if it wasn't for Jesus, I'd pull you over this counter!\"\n\nI don't know about you guys, but I don't play around when someone tries to make idle threats like that. Especially since she decided to bring her religion into it. Something about that just didn't sit right with me, but at that point my front cashier showed up and I let him take care of her while I just simply walked away before I said something unproffesional.\n\nBut as I was walking, I heard the customer call me a fat ass. And something just snapped. I almost continued walking away, but for whatever reason, I decided to turn back around, take her pizza off the counter and throw it onto the ground (yes, I agree, that was completely out of line). I told my cashier to give her a refund because she wouldn't be getting her pizza. She then opened up the door connecting the lobby to our BOH trying to get at me, so I pushed the little button under the counter that calls the cops. Thankfully there was another customer in the lobby who I think must have worked security or something before because he came in and ushered her back out into the lobby and started trying to talk her down like he'd done this before. If it wasn't for that guy I would have probably gotten my ass kicked by this angry lady.\n\nSo the cops showed up and she gave her spiel first because she waited for them, and then while I told my side she was on the phone with our call center screaming at whatever poor soul had to hear her complain about me. But the cops were very sympathetic toward me and even started telling me about all the crazy people they've had to deal with as officers, and they asked if we wanted to file a restraining order. So hopefully I won't have to deal with her again.",

I had to use the 12 pie carriers which I had never used before. I got all the pizzas into the back of my swagged out mini-van and i drove down the highway to the business.

Instantly, I was wondering what the fuck I did wrong. When he got off the phone he told me that all the pizzas were folded over on one side of their boxes and the lady wanted her money back. Turns out I had put the carriers in my car sideways and fucked up every pizza. Surprisingly I wasn't fired right there and I've been working at Domino's for the past 6 months.

        "text": "So I have been a delivery driver for quite a while now. As an experienced pizza delivery guy I know that some of the worst people to deliver to are families. \nThey order a ton of pizza are always in a rush so they usually give you the wrong address, and they have kids so they usually tip horribly. But this one family will always stick in my mind.\nSo one day a few months ago we were having a pretty busy day.  When I walked in a had a half second break before going on a double if not triple order. \nSo after about an hour of this I get a delivery to a house, nothing special. I drive down their and luckily it is only a mile away (for those of you who don't live in the number 1 tourist destination in the world that translates to about 15 minutes) So I drive down there, a little grumpy with all the deliveries I had to make today and hardly getting anything from it (I just delivered to a guy who gave me $2) and rang the door bell, immediately I here a little girl yell \n\n\"the pizza guy is here!!\"\n\n I dread it knowing what is in store for me. A incredibly nice looking man answers the door. I look down at the receipt \n\"2 large cheeses and 1 large pepperoni?\"\n\n I ask he nods and i get the pizzas out of the bag I got them in 2 kids come to the door and try to take them from me \n\n\"be patient\"\n\n the dad says. I thank him in my mind, then wrestle the pizzas out I hand them to the 2 kids standing there, and give the copy to the dad to sign, then I see a few more running down the stairs. I then ask \n\n\"not to be rude, but how many kids do you have?\"\n\n he smiles then says \"6\"\n I am a little taken aback knowing that a man with 6 kids can't tip very much. He's got to send them to college. Just then i get the receipt back (which he is supposed to sign and print his signature on) It's a $20 tip! \n\n\"Are... are you sure you wanted to tip this much?\"\n\n I ask, for I have gotten a few people who made a mistake when tipping and get mad when I leave.  \n\n\"Sure, I remember back when I was delivering pizzas and people would give me small tips then I would get the one guy who would give me a big tip, I wanted to be that guy\"\n\n I then am flabbergasted and leave. He orders almost 2 times a month since then, and I am always happy to get him. Not just because of the money but because his kids are so nice. Every time he always gives a $15-$20 tip. \nJust remember to try to be that guy. ",

        "text": "Today was a good day.  Worked my usual 11-9pm shift. Drove 100 miles, and ended the night with $92 in tips, plus $9.50 per hour base pay.   \n\nHowever, It's that time a year again.  Time for deliveries to the local college.  Not deliveries to individual students, but large orders to visiting sports teams that come for weekend sporting events. \n\nToday I had three of these orders.\n\nThe college in my area hosts these events pretty regularly.  They refer visiting teams to us for large deliveries.  Sometimes the deliveries can be a pain in the ass, but, overall I profit delivering them during the school year.  So, I can't complain too much.\n\nThe most common issue for me when taking these orders is finding the customer!  All to often, all I have to go on is the customer's first name and the general building or area of campus they're at.  Whether it was the person taking the order who failed to get more specific instructions, or whether it was the customer who failed to provide it, it's irrelevant. It becomes my job to find them! \n\nToday I delivered my first two orders to campus in the afternoon.   Both going to the same visiting school's soccer team.  The first order was 12 large pizzas and a sandwich.  Despite the team not being where they were suppose to be, it was no problem because they answered my standard arrival call and told me where to come. \nEasy $20 tip off the $180 order.\n\nSecond delivery was an assortment of sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. Again, they answered my call as I was arriving, and were exactly where they were suppose to be.  I got another $20 tip. So far, so good! Got to love teams paying with their school's corporate credit card.  Usually it's a good tip? After all, it's easy to tip well when it's not your money! \n\nThe third delivery was for a different school. They wanted it delivered at 9 p.m., which is when we end deliveries for the night. O.k., no problem! I'll get out 15 minutes later than usual. \n\nI drove over to campus and arrived right on time.  I go to make my call as I'm driving in.   It goes to voice mail.  I try again. Same results.  Uh oh, I know where this is going.\n\nO.k, I'll just head to the gym? That's where it says it is being delivered to (The gym is in a huge athletics facility with numerous floors) Unfortunately, the side door closest to the gym is locked, so you have to park in the side lot and take a long walk, -probably 700 feet?- to get from where you park and into the building. When you're carrying lots of food, this can be a challenge at times.   When delivering to teams at this facility, usually their busses are in the side parking lot.  I drove over, but no busses in sight.\n\nI made the trek to the gym.  The place is empty! I walked through the halls and checked the locker rooms, but nobody anywhere!  Basically closing up for the night.  On the way out, a student working at the welcome desk said somebody had been looking for me earlier, but she doesn't know where they went?   She tells me to follow her.  We go down a hall, back to the same locker rooms, then upstairs.  Nobody around. They've vanished!\n\nWe come back down stairs.  At this point I've been here for 18 minutes lugging all this stuff around looking for the customer.  \n\nI'm losing my normal patience.  The girl is really concerned, but I assure her it's not her fault or responsibility to find the people.  I tell her this kind of thing happens a lot over here. That I usually just deal with it, but I've been working ten hours. My shift is suppose to be over twenty minutes ago, and I just want to go home. \n\nShe ask's what we'll do with all the food?  I tell her it will probably all be thrown in the dumpster? But it's not my money and at this point I don't really care.  I tell her, I guess they'll learn their lesson for next time?  She agrees and laughs.  \n\nI make my way back to the car. It's now approaching 9:25. I make one last call.  This time a lady answers. However, she's out of state and not even with the team. I tell her I'm here with the delivery, but can't find the team. She starts questioning whether I've gone inside and looked around?  I confirm that indeed, I've been here twenty minutes and there's nobody around. (This was one of the rare times I show any sign of irritation with a customer.  I usually just bend over and take whatever they give me!  I straight out tell her in an frustrated tone, that I've been here twenty minutes, my day is over, and I'm about to go back to the store.  With a condescending tone, she tells me they must be on the bus? I'm trying to tell her there's no bus here, but she demands I wait while she she puts me on hold and calls them. I'm put on hold and eventually hung up on.\n\nIn the meantime, I can see a small white passenger van parked down the street. I noticed it there when I arrived, but it wasn't like the normal tour busses the teams come on. Or even parked in the places the busses park.  I really paid no attention to it. After all, the order says the team is in the gym.  Not out front in a small van.\n\nWhile I'm waiting on hold and subsequently disconnected, I see a girl get out of the van, quickly coming my way.  I hop out and ask if she's their for the delivery?  She says yes, they've been sitting out front in the van waiting for me! \n\nI inform her my instructions say I'm to go to the gym.  That I've been there and all over the rest of the damn building! I'd tried to call on arrival, but nobody answered the phone. I told her she was lucky, because I was just on my way back to the store with the food.  Regardless, I put on a fake smile and act like it's not big deal. \nShe paid cash.  $1.50 tip on a $150 order! \n\nIn was livid!  I'd just read a thread on this site last night about snarky responses people have said to people who give insulting tips.  One almost came out of my mouth!  That's never happened! As tired, hungry and spent as I was, I managed to bite my tongue at the last minute! Nothing slipped out.  \n\nI made my way back to the store and cashed out. Reiterated to my managers that I wish that when we got these orders called in, they'd let me be the one to take the order. It seems like half of the time one the inside people take these orders,  these kind of complications happen. They have no idea what it's like from a driver's perspective.  Pure frustration!  Especially at the end of a shift when you're jacked up on ten hours of coffees and nicotine, need to piss like a race horse, and haven't eaten since you got out of work night before.\n\nThis is just another day in the life of a delivery driver.  The steak and the beer waiting for me at home soothed my nerves just enough to get up and do it all over again in the morning. ",

        "text": "2 quick stories from today. On mobile so I apologize about format and spelling.\n\n1. We had a lady call and complain that there was no ziti in her baked ziti. The manager asked what she meant, since when the order was made, there was clearly ziti noodles in the bowl. She said there was sauce, cheese, and noodles, but no ziti. My manager asked her what she thought ziti was and she thought it was some type of meat. He informed her that the ziti was the noodles and she hung up on him.\n\n2. A little background info for this one. We have a customer who calls us every couple of weeks to order food. There is something wrong with him, not sure what though, so he tends to makes things difficult for us, and acts like an ass about a lot of things. For example, every time he orders, we quote 45min to 1hour for delivery. He calls back less than twenty minutes later to complain how he hasn't gotten his food yet, when most of the time, it's getting ready to come out. Anyways, today he ordered a 2-liter and lasagna. I just got back from a delivery when his food was out so I grab it and head out the door. Get to his house, do the food/money exchange and head back. About 10 minutes later he calls and says we didn't deliver his 2-liter. I get on the phone with him and tell him I delivered his drink and food and it's there. We go back and forth for a couple minutes when he decides to hang up on me. Not even 2 minutes later he calls back and I tell my manager to handle it. He called just to say he found it on his counter and then hung up right afterwards.",

I've been learning how to make stuff on the cook line so I can make my own lunch whenever I get something while working. So last night my manager was covering pizzas when we're getting a bunch of pizza order, so the cook went over to help. In the middle of the pizza rush, we got a chicken parmesan with spaghetti. Really easy to make so I go and make it for them and keep an eye on the tickets. We keep getting a ton of pizzas, maybe 5 every couple minutes and we start getting busier. I got a few more pastas, some apps. Everything is cool.  Pizza orders still coming in strong so I just say fuck it I'm cooking tonight. Tell the other drivers working to just take over and handle it, which they did wonderfully. The dinner rush come and I almost get messed up, a ton of orders coming in and I'm bouncing all around the cook station. Cashiers are helping, the cook is helping every few minutes when he can and I'm just trying to get the food out without burning it. At the end of the night, we made $15 a person so it was a good night. I'll admit, driving is a dangerous job, but it's a hell of a lot easier then what the insiders have to do.",

Only been working here a week and what I've noticed is it takes me ridiculously long to go on short deliveries because of long lights, traffic, etc. At my old spot I racked up give or take $70 a night sometimes 100+ and that was driving slow(hated the people inside) last night was extremely busy I had a double delivery every time I stepped in. Even though I tried my hardest to get there ASAP it's like I hit every red light, missed turns, and people seemed to take longer to answer the door. You know those nights! Then the icing on the cake was a lady who had every light on in her house and has ordered 7 pizzas (requiring 2 bags) I ring, knock, ring, and call twice. No answer. 7 Minutes later I decdide to leave and she calls saying \"oh im sorry sweetie im at the country club down the street!\" Okk... she hangs up before telling me where it is but I find it on my way out. Shes nice, I load all 7 pizzas in her car and she slashes the tip bar out. What a way to end the night. I totalled $50 but if I had been totally efficient like usual I wouldn't be surprised at 80$+ \nIt was just one of those nights but scrolling this sub and reading all of these stories of people in my same shoes, with the same unique stories/complaints/ etc. Can't help but laugh and smile knowing others are in the same boat. Love my job! Get paid to listen to music and have my car smell like pizza!\nLove you guys :)",

So I started handing them the receipts longways with a pen sat in the middle, this was better, but still not great. Then I saw it, from a more experienced driver in the store, a clipboard! How had I never thought of this!\n\n\nIt's been years since then, and even though my journey as a Delivery Driver will be ending in 12-14 months as I'll be graduating college, the past 3 years one single clipboard has served me well.

This is due to drops, shutting door on it, accidentally sitting on it, etc. I also use the clipboard to keep track of my deliveries and my tips by putting the delivery tags on the back of the clipboard. I have removed the \"slab\" that eventually builds up on it several times, this is just the most recent \"slab\". I retired this 3 year old clipboard today in favor of a smaller clipboard that I will not put delivery tags on the back of, it also has a nifty pen holder that I slapped on it. \n\n\nSo that's it! Show me your clipboard! One driver I know wrapped his in colorful duct-tape and embedded a tiny calculator in the top so customers could do quick math while adding a tip, how clever is that!",

        "text": "So I'm a manager at the better ingredients pizza joint. Tonight I only worked volume, and got the chance to be on phones and counter instead of makeline and closing the store. Easy enough, I started out there, and I'm good with people. \n\nBut tonight, oh man. A guy calls up, looking for his food. I look it up, says it's on the way, and I double check the rack to make sure it wasn't still in store and checked out early. Not there, driver has it, so I tell the customer it is on its way. An hour later he calls back. Says after his first phone call, he saw a driver from our store in the neighborhood giving someone else pizza. But none for him. So he had called back. And during that second call he tells me he asked for a manager, but whoever had answered put him on with a driver. Okkkaaayyy, do you remember anyone's name that you spoke with? Nope, of course not. He says it has been over an hour and a half now since his first talk with me when I said he should be getting it soon. So I tell him either we remake it, no charge, and he gets a different driver, to ensure he gets it, or I can put it into the system that he's entitled to a free one next time he orders. He says the latter, and that he's going to find something else to feed his family. By this point big boss man had left, so I speak with closing manager about the issue, and he says he did indeed talk to that customer, and driver was out with it to try to re deliver because driver claims there wasn't an answer at door or phone when he tried the first time. Damn, okay. Driver gets back, and guess what? This second time he didn't even have the whole damn order! Christ. I feel really bad for this customer now, but I can't help but laugh still. \n\nAnother customer slated for delivery calls, and I end up answering it, she says she can see a driver of ours driving around the neighborhood, up and down her street, and he didn't notice when she tried to flag him down. So I look it up to see which driver it is, because she says the phone number that was used to place the order wasn't correct (idk how that happened, but w/e moving on) so our driver can't call her since he's apparently having trouble finding her. So I tell her I can grab his cell number hold on. Turns out, every damn employees, driver and insider, has their number plastered about the office, except for this guy. God damn. She tells me he's just sitting at the end of her street, she doesn't want to jog down there, shouldn't have to do so, and yea, I agree, especially if there's a chance it's more than a few houses away and he could drive off in the other direction or something and never sees her. He does finally go back towards her and she manages to catch him on what she said was the 8th pass by. Ha. God damn. I just know this is a driver a few of us have been salivating over getting rid of. If he doesn't want to use tech like gps and cellphones, I could maybe understand. But this guy is young, and I've seen him on his damn cell phone before, so it irks the crap out of me that in this day in age there isn't a way to contact him if shit goes wrong or whatever you know? Same guy who didn't want to watch the training vids that every single other person has to watch, and whined about it like a little bitch so I finally told to go the fuck home cause I couldn't hear it anymore. \n\nThird story of the night, not about a driver at least. A person picking up carry out comes in to get her pizza. She had to wait a minute while dealing with others before her, and she stared hard core at the makeline. She gets up to me, and says she doesn't want her order now that she saw those making pizzas weren't wearing gloves. I tried to explain we all wash our hands before handling food and that since the oven temp is so high, gloves aren't required, and there's no touching of food after it goes through the oven. But nope. Had to void her out. Just last night another lady said it was weird that my closing driver was touching a broom, then got her pizza and sliced it. Told her he doesn't touch the food at all, she still said it was weird. But she paid and took it anyway. Weirdo.",

        "text": "I used to work in a fairly busy papa johns in a very affluent part of town a few years back.  I would average $6 a delivery when I cashed out and we would run 3 to 4 orders per delivery.  A great gig aside from the every other week oil change I was averaging.  Great group of co-workers and we all had similar senses of humor.\n\nI was hired after my brother moved on to other jobs based off of his reference to them of me, and from his reference of them to me.  I guess he told them to prank me often because they were always trying to get me.  I used to work security so by nature I'm always paying attention to whats going on around me and I have pretty quick reflexes.  All that to say...they couldn't prank me.  I could see when they poured the jalapeno sauce in my coke, when they were about to throw dough at me, when someone was about to throw a cup of water in my face..etc.  They just kept missing and I could tell they were getting frustrated.  So another driver decided to up his game and on a busy night he put a box of tampons (roughly the same size as our wings box) in with an order.  It was so busy that the in-store guys were packing our bags and the manager was just assigning the deliveries.  Would walk in, grab the delivery receipt and the bags, and drive away.  \n\nSince I'm used to doing 3 and 4 order runs I would find my boxes in the bag, pinch it down and slide out the right pizzas.  Due to this lucky habit I narrowly avoided giving it to a customer.  When I got back to the car, I looked in the bag to see which order had the mismatched box and discovered my luck.  When I came back to the store, I naturally placed the tampon box in the other driver's bags.  Ahh such sweet revenge.\n\nThey finally nailed me though after a double shift on a rainy day.  Coming in from my final run to help clean up, I walked into the back room and found everyone around a guy on top a step ladder.  They were rather emphatic about a leak in the ceiling.  The step ladder guy asked me to go get a broom handle and hold the bucket up.  I was tired and given the near panic in his voice I responded pretty quickly...only to see the satisfied looks on all their faces.  There I was stuck holding a bucket full of water against the ceiling with a broom stick feeling like an idiot.",

A relative of mine owns an independent store in a rather affluent neighbourhood, and this happened today:\n\nI roll up to the house with a ~$28 order (a 2-pizza special with a drink), and walk up to the door.  The guy opens the door, and after pleasantries I tell him the total.  He pulls out what HAD to be at least $1500 or more in cash and proceeds to give me a 50 and a 5, and says thank you.  Obviously I am all but gushing thank yous to him about his very generous $27 tip, and I head back to my car.  Before I drive off, a mixture of common sense and my conscience hits me and makes me realize that he probably thought I said $48 instead of $28.  I knock on his door again and, sure enough, that's exactly what happened.  He gave me $35 instead, still a great tip.  And it's pretty wild in this area, I mean if a delivery tip is less than $5 here, I am truly shocked.  More often it's $6+, and plenty of times into the double digits.  I find that a lot of these more affluent people treat the debit machine 'tip' option like they would at the expensive restaurants they go to, and just plop in 20% instead of a much smaller dollar amount, and hand the machine back.\n\nI wanted to share this story because all too often the posts here are about worse-off neighbourhoods and horror stories (and rightly so, because this IS the place to vent about those things), and I just wanted to lift the mood a bit and also ask, **is anyone else on this sub lucky enough to work/deliver in an affluent neighbourhood?**  If so, do you get a lot of pocket-cash-wad people, or super generous tippers?

He realized his mistake when the customer at the college called him back. He is gone for around an hour fixing his mistake.\n   Meanwhile orders are pilling up, our phone is ringing off the hook. Deliveries to every corner of our delivery radius are being placed. Whenever I take a call I tell the customers that our delivery times are much longer than normal. A few customers that I talked to upon being told so change their deliveries to pick up, tank god.\n   By this time deliveries are stacking up much faster than they can possibly be taken out, I'm talking about one every two or three minutes for well over an hour. Why is this happening on a Tuesday? This is normally a slow night for us with three drivers being more than enough. By this point I don't know what to do, its essentially myself and one other greenhorn driver that has only two weeks experience under his belt. Our third driver is still in the process of fixing his fuckup as that college is about a 20-30 minute roundtrip. Too make things easier, I start staking delivery slips onto on another that should be taken with each other, this should make things easier on our newer driver as he doesn't quite know the local area as well as us seasoned veterans.\n   With things as busy as they are I take a double down a local/rural/residential road, after all these two deliveries are close to one another and shouldn't take to long for our kitchen to prepare. The first order consisted of two identical salads with grilled chicken and two other sides while the second order was merely a large pizza and fries. Well somehow the kitchen didn't notice that each salad had requested extra chicken an it took 20 extra minutes for them to grill an extra order of chicken for this order. WTF?. Upon seeing this I called the customer to let them know that, in fact, their order was in the process of being made and that it would reach their address as soon as possible, they said that it was ok that it took so long and were very courteous about the situation. I took that order as a double along with another, both customers were more than understanding.\n  Get back to the store only to be greeted with untold numbers of delivery slips, the only saving grace of which is that our third driver has finally returned to the store and is taking as many deliveries as possible to help us out. Seeing that the situation is unsalvageable at tis point I take a natural triple; two close by and one to the edge of our delivery zone two towns down. This triple took me over 40 minutes but time were desperate. After returning from this ridiculously long delivery I was greeted by the news that no driver ever wants to hear \"You took the wrong pizza\". Fuck my Life, how could I have been so careless??? After all it was busy and our delivery area in the store was absolutely full of deliveries but seriously FML.\n   I guess that one of our customers, whom that pizza should have gone to, called in a hungry-only-pizza-that-I-ordered-over-an-hour-ago-can-fix-my-rage state and demanded that his precious pizza get there as soon as possible. So I took it. No tip. \n   After getting back to the store I was informed that I was going to be taking a double, A somewhat close delivery along with one way down a country road in the next town down, I am talking really, really far, which on a good day takes over a half hour to get there and back.\n   To make matters even worse the close delkivery had just called and said that they weregoing to cancel if it wasn't taken by a driver in the next minute. Great. Not mu fault that we are experiencing the single gretest orders on a Tuesday that I can ever remember in my three years at this establishment. Us drivers really are trying our god damned hardest to get everything out as soon as we can. Anyway, get to the first delivery and express my condolences, after all no one should expect to wait an hour and fifteen minutes for two small pizzas, but this was no normal night, we were all being pushed to our breaking points; both our in store crew and our delivery crew.\n   After this things started to wind down and we were able to catch up with our remaining deliveries until the end of the night. I apologize to any and all customers who received late, cold food; Myself and the other drivers were trying our absolute hardest o get everything out as quickly as possible. I really want to thank our understanding customers and our amazing in house staff. Just remember if your food is late it is rarely your drivers fault, we want your food to get o you as fast as possible and feel ashamed when we are not able to deliver it in an efficient manner,  if your food is ever late please ear in mind that there are quite possibly extenuating circumstances preventing us from getting to you as quickly as we would like.\n 19 deliveries, $85 in tips\n\n\n   \n\n\n",

I told the guy on the phone I was ordering carryout, he took all my info, nothing out of the ordinary. So I leave work, get to the store, and get a call from my brother that the pizza has been delivered to the house. I don't live close to the store, so I drive all the way home over 25-30 minutes, and by the time I get there the pizza is cold. \n\nWhat happened was the pizza arrived, and my brother had no idea what was going on since I ordered it at work and was picking it up on the way home. Apparently the driver was a dick about it, and refused to leave until he got paid. Obviously he left without a tip. \n\nThey screwed up the order, they delivered a carryout, the pizza was cold, and the driver was a dick while my brother was just trying to figure out why there was a pizza being delivered. I'm pissed. Should I call the store and complain? Should I just cut my losses?",

        "text": "Hello Redditors !     Let me first start by saying that I have been in this subreddit for a bit but haven't posted until now. I am a new pizza delivery driver and cook for a pizza hut in the great state of Alabama. Ive only been working close to a month. \n\n       Now that that is over, The other day I was working that worst shift of my life, 2:30 pm -7:00 pm, Which is possibly the worst time to work, considering it was Saturday which meant football games where on most of the day, and in Alabama football is like a religion to a lot of people. When I got to the store at 2:00( I like to get there early to get some thing to eat) The store was SO backed up with carry-out customers that I had to clock in right when I arrived and as soon as I did, I was told that I had to take 3 deliveries that where all ready to be taken. \n\n\n       So, I grab everything get my bank and call the first order to the phone number given when they ordered over the phone, \"Hello this is Pizzaguy from pizza hut your order is ready and will soon be delivered\" that is when Confirmed with her over the phone if the address was correct and she said she was. On the ticket it said that she was at the Texico on \"such and such highway\". I go to \"such and such highway\", which is close to 20 mins away (Our pizza coverage is in a pretty big city) After about 20 mins I see no Texico, so I call her phone......*ring ring ring *No answer, I did this 5 times and never got a answer, not even a voicemail. So i call the store and manager says just to comeback to the store. When i get back manager says lady called and said she is waiting for me and she is sure that she is on \"such and such highway\" And I preceded to tell manager that there is not a Texico on that highway, Luckily one of the other drivers lives on this highway and happened to be there in the store, so I told him to take it, Time goes by and he comes back to tell me that It was in fact not a Texico but a Chevron she was at, This made my day the worst until i got off at 7, because I had gone on a wild goose chase for this apparent Ghost Gas station  only to find out that it was a totally different one. I wish that it ended there......\n\n\n       After this fiasco, I still had two other deliveries to take, so after I threw out her pizza since It was close to a hour to finally get her a pizza, she got a remake, I took the 2nd delivery and by this time the 2nd delivery had been late by 30 mins, (Fun fact, I was the only driver for the first hour and a half which is why these deliveries where fucked up) So by the time I get to the address, Of course the number for the house is wrong, and I cant find a 230 on this street as it only goes up to 229, so I call the number, and she says \"o yeah we canceled that order about 20 mins ago \". SO now I got two deliveries that have gone down the drain. I take the last one to the address and this is a new costumer, he is very understanding, tho his pizza is late, And he even gave me a good tip. Throughout my shift that day I had in total 3 deliveries that turned out either they canceled or gave me wrong address and was late. \n\n\n     TL;DR The moral of this story is that when you order a pizza please have the correct info otherwise you wont get it right the first time.

        "text": "When you think of delivery drivers being assaulted the job, you think of beatings or stabbings.  Maybe even getting shot?\n\nWell, I've only been assualted twice on the job. The first time is more memorable than the second, more serious incident. \nIt was mid-afternoon during a day shift. Not much going on back at the store. I certainly was in no rush to get back and do inside duties.   I was returning from a delivery and opted to take the long way back. I'll call it taking the \"scenic route.\" Of course, 5 MPH below the limit.  After all, it's all about driving safe, right?\n \nI was coming up a hill on a long straight stretch of road. Driving about 40 MPH.  Listening to some tunes after smoking a little herb. Just a nice leisurely cruise down a scenic country road.  I saw a pickup truck coming down the road toward me. He was going the opposite direction at about the same speed as I was doing.  I had my driver's side window rolled down.\n\nAs the other driver passed me, something hits me like a ton of bricks.  Like, literally! Something hit me right in the face and exploded all over the  front interior of the car! I was stunned, but managed to stay on the road.  It took me a few seconds to realize something had come through the window and had hit me in the face. Probably at a closing speed of 75 MPH?   I could taste something salty and wet. At first I thought it was blood?   Then I noticed what appeared to be lettuce falling off my face into my lap.  There was a hamburger bun stuck in the collar of my shirt. The special sauce and fries were all over the inside of the car! I even had a bun stuck on my front windshield. I found the beef about three weeks later vacuuming under my seat.\n\nIt was a Big Mac attack! Somebody in the oncoming car had thrown their McDonald's meal right through my window and directly into my face. \n\nBy the time I realized what had just happened, the culprit was so far down the road behind me that I never would have caught up had I done a u-turn and chased after them. Calling police was pointless, because I couldn't have even told you what the truck looked like? I wasn't even paying attention.   Nonetheless, I was ticked off!\n\nTo this day, I'm unsure whether the other driver had seen me coming with my rooftop sign and deliberately targeted me for a burger assault? Or, perhaps it was completely coincidental and they just happened to toss their leftovers at just the right moment?\n\nI guess I'll never know? I won't forget this one.  It's actually kind of comical looking back on it years later. \n",

Someone in a dark car took a wide and reckless right-on-red and clipped a ~10 year old boy who was crossing the street in front of my shop.\n\nThe driver sped off and the boy lay there in the left turn lane some 25 feet from me. Luckily an ambulance was within the intersection's vicinity and there was EMS there very shortly after. \n\nMy point is this: before that happened I was fuming at traffic. Ticket times were running high. We've all likely been here. 45 mph turns to 48 mph. Yellow lights look a little more alluring. Etc.\n\nNo matter the degree your driving changes when you're legitimately rushing, and I'm sure the solemn lot of you who do not rush will downvote me into the dust, none of that mattered while I listened to this little boy suck hard for breath and cry and scream his high pleading cries and screams. Eight or so personnel huddled around him while I was frozen and listening, locked in traffic, as my world was minimized into very simple black and white terms. \n\nIt's easy to prioritize our rush over many other people. I just want you guys and gals and otherwise to be safe out there. Meticulously safe. If not for yourselves, for others. \n\nI realized before posting that this is likely redundant. I don't say any of this thinking that what I've written will act as any sort of revelation. To be utterly sincere, and i appreciate you if you've read this far, I have no one else to tell in this capacity. \n\nI was affected immensely. I imagine this will stay with me.

        "text": "I've seen some things in my time delivering that I wish I could just forget.  Horrible things.  The sights. The smells. The atrocity.  The people and places involved, I will remember long after I deliver my last pie.\n\nI'm not taking about coming across the grisly aftermath of fatal automobile accidents.   I'm talking about delivering to customers with the most gut wrenchingly disgusting living arrangements. \n\nSure, I deliver to a handful of places where you can smell the cat urine emanating out of the house when you're still 25 feet from the door.  However, those are nothing compared to some of the other places I've been in!\n\nThe first residence that comes to mind is a regular customer.  A disabled women of about 50 years old.   Interestingly enough, she only has one and a half feet!  She was born that way.  She's nice enough and lives alone with her service dog.  She's a great tipper.  But she's  also a severe hoarder.  Kind of like the one's you see on daytime talk shows.  \n\n  There's usually rotten trash and wet UPS packages on the porch.  Sometimes the trash is swarming with flies and maggots.  She meets me at the door, but you can see into the house. The junk is piled to the ceiling, with only small pathways to navigate from room to room.  A sweet, rotten milk and mold-like aroma always comes through the door to great me when I arrive.   The garage is so full of clutter, the door can't shut, and the junk spills out into the driveway like an avalanche coming down a mountain! It's unbelievable! The first time I got a look inside, I was taken aback and concerned for the women.  She seems happy enough, but I don't know how you can live in that kind of filth? \n\nThe second customer is an older woman who lives in a very nice house on the lake. Probably worth close to a million dollars in an exclusive neighborhood. From the exterior, it looks like just another nice house.  However, the smell that comes out is atrocious!   I never really knew what it was, but I learned to hold my breath as she opens the door. Sometimes flies will buzz out during the summer. \n \n Only in recent months did I get a good look what's inside behind the front door?  I can see straight into her bathroom when she opens the door. She has one of those attachments on top of her toilet thats helps older disabled people sit down to do their business.\n\nOne day I was waiting for her to go back into her kitchen to find more money. I happened to glance into her bathroom and noticed there was shit all over the toilet seat! It was leaking down the toilet onto the floors and you could see the poop trail coming out of the bathroom!  Like, a trail where she'd walked through it and tracked it around the house. There was even a fecal streak on the light switch next to the door. Even worse, you could tell some was new poop. Some was older.  When she turned around, I saw a fecal stain on the seat of her pants, and it was running down her leg!  I really came close to vomiting that day! \n\nWhenever I go there now, as soon as I get back to the store, I change out the bills she gave me for \"clean money\". Then I wash and sanitize my hands!   One time I even thought I smelled dung in my car on the way back to the store?  This might have just been in my head, though? \n\nThen there was Ms. Mulligan...\n\nI delivered to Ms. Mulligan for about a dozen years before she abruptly quit ordering deliveries. Perhaps she died? Not sure? \n\nI'm not really sure what was up with this woman?  Rumor was her husband had died years ago. Apparently,  she'd lost it and never came back? She lived with her granddaughter and two grown sons.  They weren't retarded, but might have been borderline? They were real slow IQ type. Kind of inbred looking? (O.k., really inbred looking!) They also worked on a pig farm and wreaked of pig excrement.  I'm not sure if they actually talked, because they usually just grunted and snorted if you tried to engage in conversation.\n\nAnyway, Ms. Mulligan use to order these huge orders for the family clan. Order like six large pizzas and a half dozen two liters of soda.  Sometimes she would call for a delivery consisting of only soda.  6-10  two liters of orange soda. \n\nThe house was rancid.   You could smell it as you were coming up the stairs.  For a long time I called her the smelly cat lady. That was until it dawned on me, there were no cats there! The smell was the smell of rot.  Even the poor lady herself was rotting.  Her bare feet were warped, yellow and purple.  With some kind of bloody blister looking things? You could also see a greenish hue on her fingers around her rings!\n\nIt was common for her kitchen sink to be full of dirty dishes.  Flies buzzing about. I took a delivery one day. The breakfast she had prepared that morning was out on the table.  When I went back a week later, the same food was on the table!   Only the pancakes and eggs had grown blue mold. The sausage had turned black. The hash browns were gray.  It was in a full state of decomposition! \n\nShe use to do this with our food, too.  I'd deliver her a half dozen large pizzas.  A week later she'd order again, but half of our pizzas from the previous week would still be laid out and half eaten on the table.\n\nFor years she never tipped.  Then we learned the trick. When she'd call to place an order, when it came time to run her credit card, if you specifically asked if she wanted to add a tip, she'd add a generous one! \n\nThese three customers will always be hard to top. At least in terms of most disgusting places I've been in. I've been in countless houses. These were the worst!",

Then, he laughs a little and promises he'll do that for me before heading back inside.\n\nI was twenty before I figured out who Boston was... I wish I would have had that information years sooner. Here's hoping that kid has opportunities I never did.",

        "text": "You always hear the statistics.  Food delivery is considered one of the most hazardous jobs in the United States.  Fortunately, I live and work in a state with one of the lowest rates of violent crime.  People leave their cars unlocked and running while they run into the store.  A lot of people don't even lock their houses at night. Things like armed robbery are exceedingly rare. \n\nMy town is a relatively well-off, upper middle class town.  I've delivered here for many years and have never really feared anything bad happening while I work.  I've only had one incident in my many years delivering to remind me that I'm not immune from violent crime on the job.\n\nThe incident happened about eight years ago. I was still working for a Domino's franchise. \n\nIt was the getting late on a typical Friday night. As usual, we were getting hammered with deliveries to the local college.  Weekends after 10:30 p.m., As soon as you'd return from one delivery, you'd be dispatched right back with a couple more.  \n\nI was dispatched with two orders.  I drove over to the small campus, like I've done hundreds of times before.  Dropped off the first order and head to the next.\n\nI pulled up in front of the dorm. I went to make the call to the customer to come down and meet me at the door.  As is often the case, sometime this can take a minute.\n\nWhile I'm sitting there in my car with the rooftop sign atop the car, I see a group of five or six drunken male students walking through the parking towards my car.  They notice the sign on my car, and of course this gets their attention as I hear the usual joking and hollering \"Hey Look! it's Dominos! Pizza!!!\" all the typical things drunken students yell when they see the pizza guy rolling through after a few brews.  I just waved and didn't think much of it.\n\nAs they get up close to the car, they start joking around even more.  Asking for a free pizza, etc.  I just laugh and tell them I've already dropped them all off! Meanwhile, the customer is taking a bit longer to get down than I planned?\n\nWell, at some point the joking around progresses to one of them getting up onto my front bumper and jumping up and down yelling, \"pizza!\"  Before I knew it, two more have gotten on the back of my car, and the guy on front was now crawling up onto the windshield of my car as they jumped around like apes, shouting and laughing, And no, this isn't racist.  All of them were white, except for the one who later steals my car!\n\nI was trying to keep my cool.  I'm not a person that gets into physical altercations. I've never been in a fight in my life. I asked them nicely to stop a few times, but it went to deaf ears.  I started to get a little more forceful in my tone. Asking them to stop. NOW! Probably with some profanities?  Still no result.  At this point it was several minutes into this, and I finally lost my cool.  \n\nI jumped out of the car! My jugular bulged out as I demanded them to \"Cut the shit! NOW!\" I contemplated driving off with the guy hanging onto the front off my car, but ultimately decided to go after the guy who'd been on the hood.  I jumped out of the car chased him around my car about five times as the rest of the guys laughed and cheered. \n\nWhile I was chasing the guy in circles around the car, he broke off and made a dash toward the dorm. I followed in hot pursuit! Meanwhile, the sole black guy jumps into my running car and drives it off down the road a short distance before ditching it and running into the woods. \n\nAbout halfway to the front door, I heard somebody running up behind me.  I looked over my shoulder just in time to see a fist that was just about to connect with with my temple! I remember feeling the initial blow, seeing a bright flash, and then falling backward as I tripped over the sidewalk curbingbehind me. I didn't lose consciousness, but before I knew what was happening, I had this guy on my back repeatedly punching me in the head and face about 25-35 times.  A couple of his other friends started kicking me in the ribs at the same time. \n\nI was carrying a small compact .357 Mag revolver at the time. I used to carry it while on on late night delivery.  If there was ever a time to pull it, it was now! However, I knew my life wasn't in immediate danger.  I knew I'd be fired if I revealed the gun. I had enough self control not to resort to regulating the situation at hand.  I reserve that right as a last resort option.\n\nWell, all the commotion drew a quick audience. When things first started to go down, I asked a passing student to call security.  I don't know if they did or not, but I heard one of the guys yelling that campus security was coming.   The attacker's quickly scattered and the primary culprit made a break for the dorms.  \n\nI'm on the ground stunned and dazed. It had all happened so fast. I was just grasping what the hell had just happened?  All I knew for sure was that nothing was broken and I hadn't been robbed.  I made a quick call to the store to let them know I might not be back for a while after close?   I told them I'd been attacked and beaten, but I was o.k. Hadn't been robbed and I waiting for police.  I'd probably have to fill out a report? \n\nSecurity quickly called the sheriff.  They arrived and secured the building. Went in checking each room for the perps. The eventually found the primary attacker hiding in a closet trying to change into different clothing. \n\nThey finally hauled his ass out the front door in cuffs, with his pants in full sag. I don't even remember what I said, but I made some kind of insult towards him and his bitch pants and must have walked toward him? I just remember security holding me back and telling me to relax. Let them handle it.  My adrenaline was really pumping at the moment! identified the guy and off to the jail he went.\n\n I got a call from Campus Security the next day. They wanted me to come file a separate incident report with them.  When I got there, one of them informed me that the police had told them that the kid they arrested was 21. He wasn't a student, but was visiting friends who were.  He'd just been released from prison after serving three years for drug crimes.  They wanted to take pictures of the dents and scratches on my car.  Then they noticed some red birthmarks on my leg. They were convinced these we're injuries, so I just played it up and let them photograph these \"injuries\" too!   I also had an existing dent or two in my car, so I figured I might as well blame that on them, as well! More pictures were taken for the report.\n\nEventually, the jackass was convicted of misdemeanor assault, and he served seven days in county jail.  But that wasn't the end for him.\n\nAt the time, MySpace was the preferred social media.  I quickly looked the tough guy up.  With a little MySpace stalking and Internet searching, I quickly learned that he lived with his mom. I easily found her address in the phone book.\n\nI then went to the NAMBLA website.  (North America Man Boy Love Association) It's a sick group for older men that encourages pedophilia among adult men and underage boys.  I signed him up for home mailing of the bi-monthly newsletter.  I also found numerous other websites you could sign up for mailings. Primarily bizarre homosexual fetish websites and other sick stuff.  Information for penis pumps, bizarre sex toys, etc.,  Enough  junk to keep his mom's mailbox filled with interesting things for while... And keep her wondering about her son for even longer! \n\nThree years later, a coworker delivered to the same college. The guy tells him that he was sorry, because he'd beat the crap out of one of our drivers a few years ago .  He gave a great tip. He was now a student at the same college!\n\nThe next part would be kind of funny if it didn't involve me being the victim.  About four years later, I'm sitting in the local watering hole having a beer.  One of the graduating seniors from the college was in with his friends. After small talk, he finds out I deliver for Domino's.  He asks if I knew the driver that got the crap beat out of him a few years ago?   I inform him that no, I don't. He tells me of the story of the Domino's driver who  got beaten during their Freshmen year. (Behind him his drunken friend keeps shouting, \"GOT BEAAAT!\"\n\nAccording to this guy, story had become a legend on campus!  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

We remember who our good customers are too. It's not all about getting a tip. It's about being a good customer. Answer the door promptly with the money ready. We tell you on the phone how long it's going to take. This is the time to get everything in order. Make sure you have the lights on before we get there. Nothing looks more sketchy than going to a darkened house. Try not to ask how much the order is. It's the last thing on my mind and the last thing the phone person tells you before they hang up. Keep the walkway clear of ice and snow in the winter. (If we fall and get hurt, we can sue you). Please be off the phone. Tell your friends you have to go. It's just plain rude. Give a phone number where we can reach you. Sometimes things happen and we need to call you. And furthermore, be a decent tipper. If you follow these rules, your order will arrive quicker. You might even get bonuses of free stuff. I've been known to throw in a free pizza every now and then or extras such as bread sticks or deserts as a surprise when it arrives. I have change in my pocket to give back to you if your tip is less than a dollar. I don't carry quarters so I will stand there at the door fumbling for my change while your order gets nice and cold.

I know they're not trying to jack my wages but rather, improve their numbers, but still I'm uncomfortable with this. I want to politely request they let me tag in/out myself mostly because it just works out better in head that way.  It seems what they are doing is obvious wage manipulation (not malicious) and extremely illegal,such that if I request they not do that they simply comply and not fight, before I bring up the legality issue.

        "text": "Every driver hates stiffers. People who won't tip a dime. Ever! Usually, most of us try to smile and thank them for their business.  It's going to happen.  Just part of the job.  There's not much you can do about it.  Right? \n\nWell, I decided to try! Not just on people who've stiffed me a time or three, but repeat offenders! People who've stiffed me dozens of times.\n\nThere's another web site I use for pizza delivery drivers.  On it, there's a section to educate customers about tipping etiquette.  There's also an annoynomous letter on the site that you can print off and mail to chronic non-tippers.\n\nI'd been contemplating doing this for a few years, but never got around to it. That is, until this past spring.  I printed off 22 of these letters. (See letter below this story) Complete with little illustrations and in color on high quality print paper.   I then went to Office Depot and had the other website's logo professionally printed in the return address line on 22 business envelopes. \n\nAt first I was going to address them to the customers full name, but on second thought,  decided to just address them to \"Pizza Delivery Customer\"\n\nA few days later, I flew from the East Coast to California with the letters individually sealed and addressed to my 22 worst customers.   I wanted them postmarked from far away to lessen the chance they'd think it was from their local driver.  I dropped them into a mailbox in downtown Los Angeles a few days later.\n\nIt's now been five months since I mailed the letters.   Of those 22 non-tipping customers, only four have ordered since!  And each one of them has suddenly been tipping! Tipping well, too!\n\nI never imagined this action would lead to such positive results! Better yet, the other 18 customers have not placed an order again since! Less wasted gas delivering to them. Good riddance!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Anonymous letter.\n\n\nThis is a public service announcement from xxxxxxxxx.com.  What some folks don't understand is that delivery people are paid a very low amount. It is expected that they will receive tips and whatever they get belongs to them. Please, if you can afford $16 for pizza, you can surely pay the delivery person $2.50 for bringing it to your door. The driver is, in essence, your waiter on wheels. They use their own car. They work hard to give you the convenience of delivery to your door and take on added costs because of the job. Since you appreciate the service, please tip the driver.\n\nThe customary tip is\n\n15% or $3, whichever is greater\n20%+ for excellent service\nless for poor service, such as 5% or 10%\nslightly more in bad weather and for distances over 3 miles from the store\n\nThe tip is not included in the bill and it is not covered by a delivery charge if the store has one. For more information about this and pizza delivery in general, please visit our website at xxxxxxxx.com. After all, you don't want to be rude.",

        "text": "I work for local Italian oriented chain that does a fair amount of catering orders.  One of the benefits of my job is delivering these catering orders.  A lot of our catering orders range anywhere from $500-2000. Anything that's out of our local delivery area has an additional $25 delivery fee that goes straight to the driver.  Usually the customers tip well, on top of the delivery fee.  When it's a $1,000 order, even a 5% tip is great! These orders really help boost my weekly earnings. Especially during slow weeks.\n\nEarlier this summer we had one of these orders. It was being delivered to a wedding reception that was taking place on steamship paddle-wheel boat that does summer cruises on one of the lakes in my area. \n\nThe order was massive! The total was just short of $1,800.\n\nThere were fifteen aluminum trays of baked entrées consisting of meatballs, lasagna, baked ziti, and Chicken Alfredo fettuccine.  Plus, an additional 10 platters of cold cut sandwiches, fruit platters, desert trays, Hors d'oeuvres trays, 25 bags of ice... As well as all the support equipment. Think bulky metal serving trays, heated chauffeuring dishes, coolers, serving utensils, coffee urns and everything else the party had rented.\n\nThe order was so large that I had to substitute my regular delivery car for a mid-size pickup truck! My GM also had to help me.  He filled his SUV to capacity and took the lead as we headed about 25 miles to the delivery location. When we arrived, he points to me to park my truck in the only available parking spot on a busy stretch of street in a bustling lakeside summer vacation area. It happened to be a well marked 'Handicap' space.\n\nWe had arrive at the designated meet spot at the pier about 25 minutes early. This was because of my GM's insistence to leave way too early. The boat was still out on the lake with tourists on one of the scheduled daily cruises.  In fact, it was so far out on the lake that we couldn't even see it! I could tell this was going to take a while.  -Keep in mind, I was giving up several hours of time from my regular deliveries to take this out of our area and set up.-\n\nThe plan was to unload and set up prior to the bride and groom arriving. My boss and I unloaded our cars and made numerous trips carrying the entire contents of both vehicles about 250 feet to the dock.  After 10 minutes unloading, he was in a rush to get back to the store and tells me  \"Well, enjoy the nice summer afternoon!\"  \n\nAfter all, it was a nice summer day sitting there looking out over the lake. That part wasn't so bad. \n\nHe leaves me, and I wait. And wait.... The boat finally shows up 45 minutes later.  After about 15 minutes, I get the go ahead from the crew to start bringing the catering down three ramps of the shaky old dock and then up a flight of stairs to the second level deck of the vessel.\n\nIt's complete chaos with wedding guests arriving and me trying to get this huge order down numerous ramps and then up onto the boat and set up before the bride and groom arrived. I did meet one women who was suppose to be in charge of meeting me and directing things, but she disappeared soon after telling me the bride would be arriving shortly. She had no idea who is paying the tab?  After she disappeared, there was no direction. It was up to me to decide for myself where and how set things up. \n\nWhile unloading, I'd had to carry the individual trays of entres down the sidewalk to the base of the pier. They come in large aluminum trays about 30 inches long, 3\" deep and 14\" wide. When they are stuffed with pasta and sauce,  they tend to leak a little bit. Especially if they're tipped even an inch, or overfilled. \n\nWhile I was carrying one of these, several small drops of pasta sauce dripped off the corner and splattered on the sidewalk in front of the pier.  One of the wedding guests saw this and commented that the bride won't be happy if she walks through that and it gets on her dress! I immediately agreed and went to find some napkins to clean up the couple of teaspoons of sauce that had spilled. I thought I did a pretty good job considering that it was tomato sauce on top of white concrete?  Plus, it was on the public street-side sidewalk. The spill wasn't even on the floor of the venue, or even on the pier leading to it. Minutes earlier, I'd even just seen a passerby hawk a enormous lougie within inches of the sauce spill. \n\nAfter waiting for the ship for 45 minutes, it took another 45 minutes to carry it all onboard and set up. I still wasn't sure who was paying? All of a sudden, a dressed down bearded guy wearing old jeans and work boots, somewhat resembling a ZZ Top Band member, arrived announcing that he was the bride's father and had just driven three hours to be here. Naturally, I assumed he was paying the bill, being the bride's father and all? When I asked him, he said \"Hell no, I'm just here for the party!\"\n\nI had gotten everything set up. I just needed to get paid and get back to the store before dinner rush.  While I'm waiting, an argument breaks out when when one of the bridesmaids is told they can't bring their own champagne onboard for a sunset toast due to liquor license issues. The girl goes diva. Giving the captain a piece of her mind. She must have reminded him ten times how much they had paid for the event. All to no avail. The ship wouldn't sail. They were not bringing their own champagne on board.\n\nDuring the ruckus, I hear a bunch of honking up in the street. I look up to see the young bride arriving with her bridesmaids in a convertible. They're all dressed really eloquently, but it's completely overshadowed by the fact they're all covered in trampy looking tattoos all over their arms, legs and backs! After meeting the father and watching the argument with the captain, I could tell this was going to be a high class event. \n\n  I had intended to be waiting street-side for the bride to arrive to make sure she didn't walk through the sauce stains on the sidewalk. However, minutes before she arrived I'd gone back onto the boat to check everything one last time. Therefore, I missed her arrival.\n\nThe bride and guests come onboard. The lady that had met me earlier shows up and tells me the bride's paying with her own credit card.  They'll get it for me in a minute.\n\n  I wait around for a few minutes when I see a rushed bridesmaid coming toward me with a card. I smile and tell her the total.  She's standing there with a pissy look on her face and sternly tells me, in a \"do you know who I am?\" kind of tone, \"The bride doesn't think she should pay full price because she got tomato sauce on her dress as she was walking in from the car!\"\n\nI look over at the bride who's smiling and laughing with her guests.  I can't see anything on her dress. She doesn't look too distressed?  The bridesmaid notices me looking, and tells me they've been cleaning it with seltzer water for five minutes!\n\nI tell her I have no authority to discount the order.  I'm terribly sorry, but she'll have to call my manager.  I try to point out that it was only a very small amount and it was on the street sidewalk, not at the venue.  I also point out the long distance all this stuff had to be carried from the truck to the dock.  But there's was no reasoning with her.  \"The bride doesn't want to pay full price!\" \n\nThe bridesmaid finally get my GM on the phone and shoves her phone in my face so that I can talk to him.  I describe that a small bit of sauce had leaked onto the sidewalk, and supposedly, the bride had walked through some?  But that I didn't see anything on her dress. He tells me to discount one of the trays of lasagna. It was around $85. \n\nOnce I get off the phone, again, I profoundly apologize. I tell her we're voiding one of the lasagna's.  At this point, I'm pretty I sure I know the outcome of the next part of this transaction.  I swipe the credit card on my tablet and the part comes up for her to enter the tip and initial on the screen.  \n\nIn a huff, with a look of disgust, she pokes at the screen and signs. Then throws the tablet back at me. I thanked her once again and apologize for the small issue. I wished them a great evening. \n\nOn the walk back up the dock, I looked to see what the tip was? Expecting it to be lower than usual for an order of this size. Sure enough, you guessed it...A big fat zero with a line through it, as well as \"no tip\" written in addition to that! \n\nI have delivered for 16 years. I've had my share of stiffs on large orders, but this one burned me like no other! It bothered me for two weeks when I'm usually over it before I get back to the store.\n\nFor the three hours out of the store, a 50 mile round trip drive, plus a good hour of labor intensive set-up, I made base pay per hour.   I didn't even claim my $25 out of area delivery fee.  I didn't ask my boss for it, either, because I felt like it was partially my fault! Especially since he probably paid for the voided item out of his salary to keep out of trouble with upper management? I just bent over and took this one up the behind.\n\nI can understand giving a poor tip on something like this. But how white trash can you be to have an order this large and labor intensive and not even tip $5?!? This is when added gratuity should come into play! \n",

        "text": "I've posted before on here, and it's been a while since I worked in the pizza industry, but I keep remembering stories I'm sure you guys will love to hear.\n\nA little context: I was a pizza chef and occasional delivery driver. It was a smaller town, so I didn't delivery that often. We had one of the town taxis take our pizzas, but as time went on, they really started slacking and people complained about ridiculously late deliveries, so they sent me out some nights when it got busy. I'm a tiny girl, and late night deliveries are scary sometimes, like when customers try to get you to drive them back into town like you're some kind of magic midnight uber driver. I wasn't the most experiences delivery driver, to say the least.\n\nOne night, I'm on dish duty, and we get a call for 3 large donairs to be delivered for 1am to some place downtown. [Donairs are popular where i am, google it and drool] My boss made this uncomfy face and told me these guys were VERY drunk. Great. I had another delivery to take before it, since I didn't have to be there for a little while, and I called my dad to see if he wanted to go with me for the 1am trip. Just in case those guys try anything, I've got dad to smack 'em in the teeth.\n\nI drive the first delivery out to a retirement home, and I ended up running incredibly late, because I couldn't find the god damn road in the dark, and they gave us the wrong road to go down and I ended up at the back door, which was no access, and spent another 30 minutes just trying to find the front door. Then I went and picked up my dad. By the time I get back to work and pick up the 1am order, its 1:20am. Oopsie. We head out, find the place much easier, and head up the stairs and knock. Bring me to Life by Evanescence could be heard through the walls.\n\nA dudebro opens the door and looks really happy to see his order, and god you could smell the beer. This was a weeknight by the way. He has a buddies credit card to pay, but he's so drunk he can't remember the pin number, so he starts shouting down the hall for his friend. This friend had to be his dad or uncle of something because he was the typical old drunken bum you picture when you hear the words \"old drunken bum\". And he was PISSED. Not only that we woke him up, but that we were so late, they didn't get their food before they passed out. This guy is screaming at my dad while my dad he me hid halfway down the steps in case things get ugly. Dudebro walked off with out debit machine, and we were worried we wouldn't get it back. Those are expensive! Luckily, he wandered back, and as soon as he did, dad grabbed the machine, grabbed the order, and walked out with it, with me in tow. He was NOT dealing with that shit, and old guy was getting madder and madder, and I'm very sure he would've thrown a punch if we stayed any longer. [He was cursing up a storm, too, and my dad hates swearing. Even though he does it all the time, haha]\n\nWe dropped one of the donairs in their driveway making our mad dash out, I hope they enjoyed it. My dad stuck around for my last delivery of the night. Taking a pizza to a college party, which was way nicer a trip than that, so Dad didn't think my job was always that scary. I'm incredibly glad I thought to bring my dad, because poor me, I probably would never have gotten that debit machine back.",

        "text": "My last day of work left me with a beautiful story. We go to a few hotels that are outside of our delivery zone. The past few times I had gone up to this particular hotel I had gotten stiffed so when I got stuck going to it my last day I tried to put on an optimistic face. It'll be fine! I said trying to convince myself that this hotel will go down as something positive. \n\nAnyway I get up there and knock on the door. \"Who dat?\" they yelled through the door and the words \"Crap\" ran through my head...this was no longer going to be a positive thing. \n\nI tell them who I am and hand the CC slip over for them to sign. I always tell them to fill it out completely but more often than not they'll just sign it any hand it back. I give it right back and say I need at least the total amount. Their total is $15.92 and they write down $16. Wow .08 cents so excited. So I look at the receipt and ask for the coupon for the free pizza. \n\nNow this coupon is for a free small cheese pizza for any order over $10 and it says right on the coupon to give it to the driver. They already had an $8 credit applied from their last order so needless to say they were saving about $20 on this order. \n\nThe wife in the background tried to argue that the free pizza was the advertised price. The husband kept on asking if I really needed the coupon. I explained \"Hey it's a coupon, it states right on it that I need to collect it, and the person on the phone tells you this as well.\"\n\nFor 5+ minutes I was standing there. Finally the guy asks for the receipt that he signed back. I hand it back over and he re-writes in $15.92 in the total taking back that .08 cent tip. So I took back his free pizza from my pile of food and handed the rest to him. He asked again why I needed the coupon and why I was taking it away. I just walked away with the free pizza in hand saying \"I wasn't even going to enter your .08 cent tip anyway.\" as he closed the door. \n\nIt was so satisfying. They called the store to say the rest of their food wasn't good but didn't receive any credit and refused the food to be made again since I hadn't called the store to give them the heads up. I told them once I got back and my manager was like \"You took away the pizza?\" I just nodded my head and he laughed and said \"Nice!\" \n\nHonestly if he had just tipped me and been nice from start to finish I probably would've given him the pizza but he didn't deserve it.

It was my first delivery of the day to this elderly lady who lives pretty close to my store. She insists that we call five minutes before arrival every time, has never tipped more than $2.00 and is just generally condescending. Another time I delivered to her I said \"Hello! How's it going today?\" and she immediately responded with \"So what are you doing with your life?\" and proceeded to tell me about her daughter being an OBGYN. It was odd. Anyways, that morning she was making an order and was complaining about being charged for two extra cups of ranch. She was throwing a fit on the phone and eventually told my manager, who was taking the call, \"I give up\", and hangs up the phone. I didn't want to waste my time taking the order if she didn't want it so I called her back and made sure she wanted it still. She did the same thing to me. \"Yes I want it\" and hung up. So I was expecting there to be some sort of incident during the delivery. I get to her house, and she continues complaining to me about the ranch and I just continue being nice and trying to get out of there. At the end she says \"You know, I only have a $20 on me. I know you deserve a tip, but I do too.\" ...I was seriously shocked. How fucking rude. If she had just stiffed me (which I was honestly expecting anyways) I would have just forgotten about it. But to say that to my face, and then proceed to not tip me over A FUCKING DOLLAR CHARGE FOR EXTRA EXTRA RANCH?! Fuck that lady. I really hate this job sometimes. ",

Obviously this means that our GM has been interviewing several people to fill those positions.\n\nBefore I dive into that, you should know that we hired a deaf 20 year old guy about a year ago as a cook (we'll call him Steve). He's done exceedingly well and continues to kick ass on a daily basis. I think he's our best cook hands down.\n\nAnyway, as our GM is looking through the applicants, she notices one girl (we'll call her Sally) who listed her education as a school specifically for deaf students. Not only this, but it's the same school as the one Steve just graduated from. My manager immediately invites her in for an interview and hires her on the spot. When she tells me about the new hire, I'm happy that Steve finally has someone he can engage in conversation with just like she is. Don't get me wrong, we're all still able to joke around and \"talk\" with Steve, but nobody in our store knows sign language outside of basic things like \"hi,\" \"bye,\" and \"thank you\", so he doesn't really get a chance to have intelligent conversations with anyone at work. \n\nShe shows up to her first day of work. She didn't do a whole lot besides watching the training videos in the back, but our GM takes her around the store to introduce her to everyone, including Steve before she heads home.\n\nLater that night, Steve, myself, and a few others are in the break room eating a crew pizza. One of my coworkers breaks out the notepad and asks Steve how he feels now that someone else there knows sign language. Steve grabs the pen and writes, \"I thought she was a total bitch when we were in school together. She's got a real nasty attitude.\" Whoops.\n",

        "text": "Haven't had a lot of time to post lately so I figured I'd just share and see how y'all have been.\n\nSo about a month ago I got robbed for my first time. Oh that sweet cherry pop.\n\nGot an order to a trailer park I'd been to many times, not an awful one or anything just seemed like regular folks.\nPull up to the lot and see a girl maybe 15 sitting on the porch having a smoke. Tell her the total she runs in and then says momma's got the money and will be back soon.\n\nNow some of you may say this is the red flag, and I think we can all agree it's at the very least total bullshit. But we also know it happens, some chucklehead thinks \"oh I have time to run up for done smokes before the pizza gets here\" absolutely stupid....but it happens.\n\nNow I'm not completely unreasonable, but I do have a strict policy on such a situation (that thankfully I've only had to enforce once) 5 minutes. I will give you 5 minutes then I'm gone.\n\nSo I say to the girl, sure I can wait a minute. I set the bag on the back of my truck and just chill.\nAfter a few seconds a couple boys come out (here's that red flag but I was in a good mood that night and let my guard down dumb mistake) \nThe boys *seem* to be as irritated as me, asking \"where is she?\" And \"how she gonna leave when she knows the pizza is coming\"\n\nWell time is ticking and I'm about ready to get out of dodge when one of the boys grabs my attention, simple thing really just asking about my truck. We chat a bit, he seems like a gear head asking what size motor, is it 4X4 yada yada...\nSuddenly, he bolts and I realize I took my attention off the other boys and the pizzas which are now both halfway across the field.....honestly my first reaction was just...\"huh\" lol, I laughed and even yelled after them \"you forgot your pepsi!\"\n\nI was a little more \"engaged\" by the time I got back to the store and my MOD  said I actually kinda scared her with the \"fire in my eyes and the fact she's never heard me raise my voice\"\nSomething along the lines of \"void this fucking order\" and \"if that fucking park burns down I'll piss on it's ashes\".....might have been a little tense...\n\nAnyway, you know the drill: call GM, Call cops, call corporate...cops (shockingly) says not much to do, it's technically misdemeanor larceny since it wasn't taken directly from my hands blah blah blah.\n\nWe stop going to the park after dark for a week or two, and even when we start again 1) I still refuse and 2) call backs are mandatory (no write ups but if you don't call the customer before leaving the store and \"confirm the address\" (i.e. make sure it's not a setup) you'll get chewed out for your own good just because they didn't hurt me or even try to take more than the pies doesn't mean the next time they won't and honestly I'm the biggest guy in my store, 6'2\", fit, drive a 2 ton pickup. The 5'9\" 100lbs soaking wet kid in the mustang is just easy pickings)\n\nSooooooo....\nThings get back to normal in the shop, pies are made, life goes on.\n\nCouple weeks go by and I'm headed to work, pull out of my driveway get to the stop sign......and keep on rolling. Shit!\n\nBreaks are kill, no.\nYes, so I call GM she scrambled to find another closer but even told me hey shit happens if you can't drive you can't drive.\n\nSo I get them fixed, my dad is a mechanic and gets the shit knocked out and I'm back on the road.\nMiss only one technical day of work since I was already scheduled off the next two.\nGo in, have an okay shift take what will be the last delivery of the night......and some dipshit pulls across my lane from the left lane to make a right turn right in front of me.\n\nI end up in a goddamn bush which had a thick enough core that it crushed the grill and punctured the AC condenser and the power steering cooler.\n\nIt wasn't ideal (have you ever tried to strong arm a two ton pickup into a right turn?) But after the cops showed up and information was exchanged I made it back to the store, clocked out and even made it home.\nMy dad again saved the day by replacing the power steering, still don't have AC but ehh I'll ride with the Windows down for now. Got back to work in about a week.\n\nGot back to work to.....no GM.\nSo, she got promoted actually. Was being sent to another store in the district. A higher performing one that was even closer to her house.\nWe're all happy for her of course though also bummed because she was a good manager.\nHer replacement comes in a couple days before to get the lay of the land and noticed something....funny about the product and inventory.\n\nYeah, apparently GM was futzing numbers. Not money or anything. Product. It didn't go bad and get thrown out it got \"freed out\" if we had dough to toss it was \"12 XL cheese for $0.00\"\n\nSo yeah, GM is gone and in her place is bunny girl. She seems nice actually, much more \"by the book\" but is on her game so it should be fine, no problems so far anyway.\n\n......how's everyone else?",

        "text": "At the beginning of our shift we receive twenty dollars as a bank for change for our customers. Usually it contains two five dollar bills and ten one dollar bills. I make sure I carry nine one dollar bills and one dollar in change (no quarters) for the under-dollar tippers. It's usually a good day and I never need to give out the change. This day is a little different.\n\nMy delivery is to a business. We have to call the customer to tell them we are outside of the building. Usually once we call it takes them awhile to come down to greet us. I like to call halfway there and tell them I'm there so we can meet at the same time. This never works. I call the customer to tell them I had arrived and she says she's coming down. By the time I get there, I'm waiting and waiting...and waiting. By the time she arrives she hands me $21. The total is $20.56. I tell her that the change is forty four cents. She tries to tell me to \"keep the change\", but I tell her that I'm giving her the forty four cents back. So she's standing there while her food is getting cold and I'm fumbling in my pockets. After a few minutes she tells me she needs to get back to work. I tell her, \"So do I.\" I finally get out the forty cents and now I'm looking for the rest of the pennies. She tells me she doesn't want four cents and I also tell her that I don't either. \nI hand her the pile of money with a \"have a nice day!\" and walk away. \n\ntl;dr: Far delivery. Customer takes long time to greet me. Hands me $21 for 20.56 order. I make her take the change without quarters.\n\n",

        "text": "Tl;dr Customer screws me then has the nerve to demand 3 cents that I overcharged him accidentally.\n\nSo I run a delivery to an area that has a spotty history when it comes to tipping. Knock twice, ring twice, no answer. At this point it is my personal policy to knock and ring a third time wait ten seconds and walk away while calling the customer and leaving a message if necessary. \n\nYoung lady picks up the phone and tells me they must have forgotten to tell the store they were actually at the park. (Apparently this is bull, they were already denied delivery to the park, because they didn't know the park address or correct pavilion. We have umpteen parks in our area.) I can literally see the park sign from the address. At this point I am totally justified in telling them to come pick it up for both practical and security reasons. However I figure, since it is a slow night, WTH I can go over and above on this one. So I go hunt them down in the park. \n\nI arrive and give them the total of $18.56. She gives me 15 and says she doesn't have enough... I impress upon her the necessity of paying for the total bill. At this point I am, again, totally justified in telling them that they can pick up their food at the store. However, there were hungry children; so I decide to go over and above again and problem solve for the kiddies sakes. Finally, in a huff, her SO jumps on a bike and goes back to the apartment for the $3.56.\n\nI follow him back to the apartment, and he asks me \"how much was it again?\". I mistakenly tell him $18.59. He comes back to me with $18.50. I professionally courteously tell him in manager speak that I have given up on a tip, but there is no way you are making me pay a single penny for your order. Screw that. Again, with attitude he goes into his apartment scrounging around for 9 pennies. \n\nI finally get back to the store and come to find out, the schmuck has called and complained that I overcharged him by 3 cents and forced him to tip me. Before the the GM can say much more than that, I grab the store phone and call him back with the GM listening in. He explains that he wants me to bring him back his 3 cents.  \n\nI, somehow, explained very professionally that I gave him amazing service over and above our typical policy; while he made a mistake about the address, a mistake about the bill, and a mistake about the required change. I apologized and asked him to let my mistake of 3 cents go... He says no. \n\nAt this point, I changed to that overly professional happy tone that basically calls the customer an idiot without actually saying it. I explain that I have his 3 cents in my hand and it is going to an envelope with his name and address in HUGE letters and place it on the office corkboard. I tell him that I will let every single person in the store know that he wants his 3 cents next time he orders or he can come pick it up. That 3 cents is reserved just for him. The 3 cents will not go anywhere else. It's a special 3 cents. Have a nice night.\n\nMy GM just shakes his head and walks out.\n\n",

        "text": "At my work we have two \"deals\" posted on the door, one for two or more items for $5.99 each, and a carryout only deal for larges with 3 toppings for $7.99. They're called \"deals\", but they're listed as coupons in the computer, so we use the terms interchangeably. I've always been told by two out of four managers that we only do one coupon per customer per day even though the computer allows for more than one. Either way every manager is different, we've been allowed to give more than one before.\n\nSo I see a (L)ady and her husband holding their two children, they stand outside for a bit to look at our two deals. They walk inside and I greet them.\n\n&gt; Me: Welcome to Pizza Place, what can I get for you? :)\n\n&gt; L: Let me get a large pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, a medium cheese, and a medium pepperoni.\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, anything else I can get for you ma'am?\n\n&gt; L: No, thank you.\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, can I get a name for the order?\n\n&gt; L: Rude Bitch.\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, looks like the total is $30 (I don't remember the exact total, but it was pretty close to $30)\n\n&gt; L: Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not right, it should only have been about $20. How much did everything cost?\n\n&gt; Me: The two mediums cost $5.99 each and the large was $17.\n\n&gt; L: Okay, but why? It should have been $7.99, the sign says $7.99.\n\n&gt; Me: Well, I'm sorry ma'am but we only do one coupon, per customer, per day.\n\n&gt; L: This isn't a fucking coupon, it's a deal. (*to husband*) I'm gonna lose my shit babe, I'm gonna fucking lose it. *(Complains loudly for two more minutes about how the cashier is a \"dumb twelve-year-old boy looking bitch\".)* \n\n(Note: I'm a girl.)\n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but I'm not supposed to.\n\n&gt; L: Well, fine. I'll just take the two mediums. And he *pointing at husband* will take the large.\n\nAt this this point I suppose I could have just separated the transactions and have been done with it, but I really don't think attacking my appearance was necessary. \n\n&gt; Me: Ma'am I know you guys are together, I can't give you both coupons.\n\n&gt; L: WELL THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS. (*Tirade about how this is unfair.*)\n\nI overestimated the amount of patience that I had left, \n\n&gt; Me: Well, let me go ask my manager if I can give you both.\n\n&gt; L: So, now you have to go ask if I can order?\n\n&gt; Me: No, ma'am I'm gonna ask if I can give you both coupons.\n\n&gt; L: You need permission to take my order now?\n\n&gt; Me: No--\n\n&gt; L: Because that's what I'm understanding here. You need--\n\n&gt; Me: I'm gonna go get my manager.\n\nI walk off to find my closing manager, he'd heard pretty much the whole exchange as he was working ovens, but of course he hates dealing with customers so he won't come unless called. But I'm confident he'll stand up for me and back me up since he heard the insults.\n\nI go back to making pizzas and listen in on the conversation. My manager gives them both coupons to shut her up and apologizes for the misunderstanding.\n\nThen I hear her loudly exclaim:\n\n&gt; L: Sorry, it's just that where I'm from in North Carolina, we just don't do that. That's just no way to treat a customer!\n\nWhen their pizzas come out I hand it to the husband, who gives me an awkward smile. I tell him \"have a good night\" with a straight face and no emotion, because I'm petty.\n\nThey call back, because of course their \"pizzas were wrong\". I give them their credit. And since I'm still pretty pissed that he didn't stick up for me, I walk into the office to tell him, \n\n&gt; \"That lady called back saying two of her pizzas were wrong, I went ahead and gave her a credit for two free pizzas, since that's what your spineless ass would have done.\"\n\nBy then it was time to go, so I clocked out and walked home.",

        "text": "As a delivery driver, your duties usually include other things like helping out in the store when you're not delivering. Doing things such as taking orders, helping make pies, doing dishes, or taking out the trash.\n\nIn my store, it doesn't really matter what you do during the time you're not on the road, just as long as you're making yourself useful. \n\nWorking long hours, occasionally frustrated by customers, sometimes you need to have a little fun to break the monotony and keep the morale up.  If you can find a way of doing this where you can blow off a little steam and help out the store at the same time, all while having a good laugh, than even better.\n\nIt's called taking security of the dumpster out back and the illegal dumpers who use it into your own hands. Being the store's personal \"Waste Security\"\n\nOn any given day, people will roll into the back lot of our store and unload their trash. Anything from household waste to construction debris. Even a paddle boat one time! The expenses of calling the garbage truck to come service us off schedule add up.\n\nI've  become the self appointed defender of the dumpster.  I confront those who dump and suggest they take it out.  I lie a little when I point to the exterior mounted camera on the side of the store, and tell them we send images of illegal dumpers to the police for citations. I tell them it's their choice, but I'd suggest they remove their trash.  I then standby and watch the hilarious results.\n\nI've gotten four people to sheepishly remove their trash when caught in the act.\n\nMy favorite involved a lady driving a Porsche SUV with out of state plates.  Looked like she was unloading a summer's worth of trash from whichever rental property she was vacating? I had just pulled in after coming back from a delivery.  I saw she had the car loaded up, so I gave her minute to get it all in the dumpster before I casually approached.  I did my bit about the camera.  Told her I personally didn't care, but just thought I'd let her know so that she didn't get fined.  She turned bright red and couldn't load it back into her car fast enough once I point out the security camera aimed at her.  She really had to have a good dig for some of it!\n\nThe best part was when she was throwing the final bag into the back of her car when it ripped.  What else could have come out? Soiled diapers and dirty paper plates from a kids birthday party! From the smell, the bag must have spent a few days out in the sun! \nIt was horrendous.  Right on the leather seats! \n\nShe got out of there in a haste!   I'm not sure if she was angry with me, or thankful for the suggestion?  To top it off, she almost caused an accident trying to get out of the parking lot while I stood behind, waving goodbye. \n\nThe second incident, I watched a car pull up and unload about three bags of trash.  He left before I could approach, so I  went to investigate.  Sure enough, household trash with clearly addressed  junk mail right on the top!\n\nThe address was about 30 miles away,  atwhat turned out to be a rather run down mobile home.  Coincidentally, I was going fishing in that area two days later.  I removed the trash bags and set them off in the woods.   A few days later, on the way to the lake with the boat, I stopped by my store to get the trash to take with me. By now it had been ripening out in the sun for a few days. \n\nOn the way back home late that evening, I went to the address I found in the trash.  Sure enough, the same car was in the driveway that I'd seen at our dumpster.  Like a ninja, I turned off the lights and quickly and stealthily hopped out of the truck. I removed the three bags of trash and left them at base of the driveway with a note pinned to it.\n\nThe note read \" Dir Sir,  Somehow I found your trash in my dumpster. I'm not sure how it got there, but thought you might like to have it back? If you're curious as  to who took it, you're welcome to come in and view our security surveillance tapes of our parking lot. Thank you!\"\n\nAs it turned out, it was the white trash fiancé of my bosses now ex-wife! She'd actually worked for us about seven years ago. One would think this would be something I later regretted?   However, it actually earned me extra brownie points from my GM!  He had a word with him and it hasn't happened again.  He even gave me a six pack of craft beer at end of my shift. On the house, when he learned what happened!",

        "text": "TL;DR Another driver from some other store followed me several blocks, met me at my destination and started an argument over a driving error on his behalf but thought I was to blame. Apologies for the novel but I'm trying to paint a picture. Also, now I realize the title is a bit misleading. He's not a pizza delivery driver but a driver delivering parts or something.\n\nI was taking a double order to the same neighborhood. Where the incident took place was at an apartment complex that had cars parked all along either side, making it a somewhat narrow road. Still enough room for two cars to pass by, and there was a double yellow in the middle of the road where the incident took place.\n\nAs I'm cruising, realizing I'm about to come up to my turn, this dude in a beater comes flying out of the parking lot of one of the apartments to my left. There were cars blocking his vision and he didn't see me coming. \n\nI slam on my brakes, but didn't stop completely, just slowed down. He swerves almost completely out of my lane (back onto his side of the road, because he flew out of the parking lot so fast, he came into my lane while making his right hand turn) as he's still correcting himself I just squeeze past him and he throws his arms up in the air. I could tell he wasn't paying attention at all until I almost hit him. \n\nI just shake my head, I keep driving to my destination. I look in my rear view mirror and see him completely turn around and start racing towards my direction. \n\nImmediately I knew the dude was going to follow me. As I'm driving, the guy is swerving behind me pretty bad. A few turns later, I'm nearly at the street I need to be on, and I'm about to make a left hand turn to get onto the street when he zooms up to my left, cutting me off from making my turn, and stops right beside me.\n\nI shake my head roll down my window, and say \"What's up bro.\"\n\n\"Yeah what was that all about? Why didn't you stop for me?\" \n\nHe wanted me to stop all the way and let him pass first.\n\n\"Because there was no need to. I went around you because I was in *my* lane and I was going the speed limit. You corrected yourself enough for me to go around you. I'm not at fault here, why are you going to follow me several blocks and try to start something over what was very obviously your fault? You don't come flying out of parking lots like that.\"\n\n\"...Well I couldn't see anything.\"\n\n\"So that's somehow *my* fault? That's why you inch out instead of racing onto the street like that. I could've hit you.\"\n\nI pointed to the double yellow that was also now on the street we were currently on.\n\n\"You see those two solid yellow lines? I was on my side and you completely flew over it on a busy street. Nobody drives like that unless they want an accident.\" \n\nHe says, \"Look man I'm just trying to do my job.\" And points to the back of his car showing a bunch of parts he had to have been delivering.\n\nI said \"Me too!\" Lifted up the delivery bags on my passenger seat and said, \"If you're just trying to do your job, was it really necessary to go out of your way to follow me and argue over this?\"\n\nHe shook his head and drove away.\n\nMaybe I should've stopped all the way and let him correct himself better before going around, but I honestly saw no need to. I just went around. I also saw no need for him to follow me and start an argument over it. Even if I was 100% at fault. Just let shit go. Jeez. The guy honestly seemed intoxicated though.",

        "text": "There are certain customers that you deliver to who stick out for whatever the reason might be? You remember them even years after your last delivery to them.\n\nFor me, one of those customers happens to be Ms. Shirley.\n\nMs. Shirley is a single older woman, probably in her late sixties to early seventies?  She's hooked up to oxygen and partially disabled.  She lives in one of those affordable living apartment buildings with income adjusted rents. Primarily old people, disabled, etc.  \n\nShe's a sweet old woman. She might be Native American, because she's given me those Indian \"Dream Catchers\" that you're suppose to hang over your bed a few times after she forgets she's already given me a couple already.\n\nI've been delivering to her regularly for four years.  Sometimes four days per week.  Usually it's smaller orders in the afternoon when we're not too busy. However, she's one of our best delivery customers. I counted 50 deliveries to her since May this year!  The best thing about her is you can show up two hours late and she could care less.  Just happy to have her food.  \n\nUnfortunately, she's on limited income and food stamps, and she's almost never tips.  Never for the first three years, anyway. Fortunately she's less than a mile from the store, so it's not too much of an inconvenience. Plus, better to get out for a few minutes when it's slow rather than be stuck working in the store.\n\nOver the years, we've established a business friendship, I guess you could say?  We always chat for a few minutes and maybe share a joke?  You can tell she's pretty lonely and happy to see somebody? I figure it's the least I can do to brighten her day before the grim reaper inevitably comes calling.\n\nIn the time I've delivered to her, I've routinely taken her mail to the drop box. I've taken out the trash, and even helped get her Christmas decorations out of her bedroom closet one time. Even when I know there's almost never a tip!  I guess I look at as a small thing I can do to help somebody else in need?  Doing a good deed. I'll occasionally bring her free food that's going to be thrown in the dumpster, anyway. Usually it's after I've delivered  the day before and she tells me she's going without medication this week because she needs to have enough money to eat. Her refrigerator is always close to empty.\n\nMs. Shirley has a problem though....  Probably more than one,  but I don't know exactly what her medical conditions are? The problem is leakage.  Not like leaking pipes in the place, but leaking bowels to be exact!   Perhaps accompanied by some bladder incompetence?\n\nWhen I've delivered in recent months, I couldn't help but notice the strong oder of human urine. It got increasingly worse every visit.  Eventually, the smell of feces gradually started mixing into the aroma wafting through the small closed up apartment. As the weeks went on, I started to see urine and dung stains on the carpets. One time there was even a poo footprint coming out of the bathroom! The oder was becoming so overwhelming it wasn't pleasant to be in there very long.\n\nOne day I come over for a delivery.  We have a chit chat for a few minutes, and as I'm leaving she stops me and asks me I can answer a question? She wants me to be completely honest.\n\nShe asks if there's any kind of bad oder in the apartment? She says the building manager had stopped by on complaints of a foul smell. When she came into the apartment to investigate, they were alarmed by the smell and told the woman she had a week to remedy the problem and they would be coming back to follow up!\n\nI didn't even know how to answer! I couldn't be completely honest! I thought as quick as a could, and the first thing out of my mouth was that \" No, maybe a little musty?  I've been in much worse.  You probably just need to open the windows and get some air flowing through?\" I pretend to keep sniffing the air very nonchalantly, acting like I can barely notice anything.\n\nI assured her that it wasn't that bad and went on acting completely ignorant of the problem.   I was never so glad get out of there.  It was more awkward than walking in on your parents having sex!\n\nA week goes by and she orders again. I go over, she buzzes me in, and I come into the living room. She's sitting in her chair with a blanket over her lap. It appears things have been cleaned up? Oder isn't as strong. She doesn't bring up the topic again.\n\nAs we go to do our transaction, she drops her credit card under her seat and has to swivel around to pick it up.  It's then that I notice she's completely naked from the waist down! I'm staring right down her pale, wrinkled and overweight butt crack! -think 65 year old cottage cheese- All the blanket covered was her lap! I almost lost my lunch. She was completely oblivious to the fact she was essentially naked and giving me a damn good look. All the while I'm maintaining a straight face and keeping my composure. Acting like there's nothing out of the ordinary. She's usually pretty sharp! How can she be oblivious, I'm thinking to myself?\n\nShe seemed a little slower that day? I'm not sure if she was on pain pills, maybe? Perhaps I was standing on top of her oxygen hose too long? (I did do that once before)   It hasn't happened again since, though! Regardless, I'll never forget what I saw! The smells of human excrement and urine suddenly didn't seem so bad. A first world problem.\n\nI've continued to deliver to her regularly.  Fortunately, at least up to this point there hasn't been a repeat of the incident. I guess there's always tomorrow, though? \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "On Friday and Saturday a driver at my store stood on dispatch all night, sending everyone out, taking ones within a half mile of the shop then coming back and doing it all over again. I suspected it on Friday then on Saturday I called him out on it, saying I wouldn't take a far delivery that should be his so he can take the next one that was at the end of the street. The person third in line to go took it, I head in the back to grab a stack of boxes, get back out front and I spot this guy through the window walking to his car with the two-minute delivery. We- like everywhere I assume- work on a first in/first out basis which is supposed to keep it fair. You get a far one, suck it up, it's your turn. The AM who was the POI both nights enables this behaviour, standing next to this driver on dispatch talking while the rest of us prep/clean in the back, and has started acting rude towards me as a result of my indifference to/confrontation with his buddy. It's my opinion that drivers shouldn't be in-charge of routing as some simply cannot be trusted to not take advantage. The franchisee runs a shift with me tonight so we'll see how that goes when I talk to him about the two of these guys but I'm still trying to figure out what to do. It really all depends on how tonight goes but I picked up an application form for the rival store. Happy with a lower hourly rate or unhappy during half my days and much more money. ",

What's the best way I can avoid this because I really want pizza right now but also don't want them to get lost. I always tip well especially in circumstances like this, but I also don't want the driver getting stressed.",

        "text": "Once upon a time I was delivering to the  local college on a hot spring afternoon.\n\nThere was a narrow road that looped around in front of the dorms so that you could drive in and pull up next to the front doors at each building on the loop.\n\nIt was spring and had just rained torrentially the night before. Therefore, there were big muddy puddles on both sides of the access road where I parked the car to drop off the food. \n\nWhile I'm doing the transaction, a car full of students comes racing around the corner about 100 feet in front of me. I suddenly hear the sound of the engine rev as they put the peddle to the metal and started making a beeline straight toward me. \n\nAt the last second they swerved just enough to miss hitting me by less than a foot, and plowed  through the giant mud puddle right next to me. This covers me in an enormous wave of muddy water!  I was soaked head to toe! Dripping mud! It happened so fast that I was stunned and it took a second to realize what just happened!\n\nThe car sped off, but saw it go down the road and out behind another one of the dorms. I drove down to investigate, but the punks had already parked and gone inside. \n\nWhat should I do? The answer wasn't hard. It was going to be Anchovy revenge!\n\nI returned to the store knowing that I'd be back to campus later in the evening at some point. I waited for the next delivery there and brought three cans of Anchovies with me. After dropping off my orders I drove back over behind the dorm they'd parked at. The car was still there. \n\nQuickly, I parked and turned my lights off. Got out of my car with the Anchovies and went over to their car. Took a quick look to make sure nobody was around and proceeded to dump all the Anchovies into their car's external AC vents under the windshield. Used a stick to make sure they got stuffed deep into the vent! I then wiped up the mess so they couldn't tell anything had been deposited.\n\nWith the hot weather, I figured within a few days they were going to notice a strong and strangely fishy oder filling the car as they drove around! I chuckle to think of the hassle and expense they must have gone through to remedy the oder!\n\nI guess I could have gone to campus security or called the cops, but this revenge was so much more satisfying!\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/3liukz/motel_owner_says_no_deliveries_to_guests/",
        "text": "In the town that I deliver in, I have three small roadside motels that I deliver to. -Think the type of motel the family would stay in during long road trips in the station wagon in years past-\n\nI've delivered to all three of these motels.  For years. Many times without incident.  They were a little sketchy and rustic, but it wasn't like The Bates Motel. \n\nOne day, one of our drivers came back to the store all worked up.  Apparently, while he was leaving the motel, the motel owner came up from behind his car.  He reached through the window and tried  to pull him out by his shirt! The driver sped off, but nothing was ever reported.  The poor driver had no clue what the problem was? Or even who the man was that assaulted him. (Later we learned it had been the motel's owner, Peter.)\n\nAbout a month goes by and I take a routine delivery to this motel.  As I'm doing the transaction, an older man of about 60 came out of the office and signaled  me over. He stated, \"I want to talk to you. NOW!\"\n\nPuzzled, I went over to see what the problem was? I asked him what I could do for him?\n\nHe responds in his thick Brooklyn Greek accent, something along the lines of \"YOOUU!  You delivered here without permission! No, No!  I did business in New York for 25 years, and this is not how you do business!\" \n\nAt this point it dawned on me that this must have been the guy who assaulted our driver? It had been a long hard day and at this point I decided to say the first thing that came to mind... \n\n\"Hey, aren't you that crazy guy who attacked one of our drivers last month?\"  I said with a smirk! At this point I'm in small office with him in front of the door.  He tells me I\"m a little smart ass! I tell him he's nuts and he needs to drop the NYC attitude if he\"s going to move up to Maine and buy a motel.  I told him, \"You're not in NYC. Your hospitality isn't how we do business here!   People are laid back and friendly.  Furthermore, we don't need permission to deliver to tenants of your hotel. They have the right.  You're batshit crazy!\"\n\nHe has a meltdown and really goes off on me now!  I just stand there and smile. He says he's calling he cops, but I volunteered to do so first on my own phone, as to spare  him the effort.  Unfortunately,  at this point he became really unstable. He comes waving his finger at me until I'm back against the office wall. While he cussing me out and calling me a little wise ass, I can feel the spit spraying into my lips and face! I think he had humus for lunch that day?\n\n   At this point, I decided to bail before the cops arrived.  He's yelling out at me that Domino's cannot deliver until he talks to owner.\n\nFor next ten days my boss attempts calls numerous times, but messages aren't ever returned  So we resume deliveries.  For the next five years things go smoothly and routinely. However, anytime I had to deliver to that motel, I got in and out as quickly as possible!   He never managed to catch me there again.\n\nFast forward six years.  I get a job at a different gig in town.  \n\nFor the first year,  I use to make deliveries occasionally to the old motel.  Most often to a single mom living there long term with her physically and mentally disabled son of about eight years old? She use to order big orders to feed them for a couple days at a time. \n\nI take a delivery to her one day. As I'm pulling into the parking lot, I notice Peter out front eyeing my car.  I go to the end of the building and try to get in and out quick. However, when I get out of my car, Peters's quickly approach ing and asks if he can help me? I don't make eye contact, quickly say \"Nope, I'm all set\" and quickly go toward the room where there's a witness.  I'm in the middle of the transaction when Peter comes storming through the breezeway door demanding to know who I am and what I'm doing?   (I'm in full uniform with a pizza bag)\n\nAt this point, I say to him, kind of surprising him \"Now Peter, we're not going to go through this again. I remember you from a while back.  You attacked one of my coworkers and confronted me. Get out of my way and leave me alone! We don't need your permission! Go back to New York, you don't belong here!\" The lady's just standing there with her jaw open watching all this.  I apologize to her, and explain the guy has a reputation of attacking drivers who don't ask permission.\n\nThe douchebag follows me back to my car raving like madman and calling me a little wise ass again.  He's also telling me he's been looking for me, but honestly I don't believe he even remembered who I was after six years? You could see the shock on his face when I addressed him by his name!  \n\nHe tries to block me from leaving and starts writing my plate number down. He's enraged while I stay perfectly calm and collected with a subtle slight smile. I was watching the lower legs of his pants because I thought the guy was about to poop himself anytime, he was so mad! Again, I call police first. He retreats toward his office. \n\n The police dispatcher asks me to leave the property and meet the officer down the street when they realized I held a CCL. (As well as the owner.. At least according to the cop?)\n\nI meet the cop and explain my story and the history with this guy. He kind of chuckles and says they're familiar with the guy. He then tells me he's going to go talk to Peter and they'll get back to me.  I go back to the store.\n\nAbout a half hour later the cop comes in. Expecting him to tell me they've told the owner he needs to chill out a little about the delivery guys coming. Instead,  he hands me a Trespass notice and advises me that I've been personally Trespassed on request from the owner!  If I return, I can be arrested!  Apparently the owner's story was a little bit different than mine? Being the only driver at my store, this essentially ends deliveries to said motel.\n\nWhen guests call for delivery now, I have to apologize and deny the order. When pressed, I tell them the owner had us trespassed for delivering,  and had attacked our competitor's drivers few times, so they\"ll need to take the reason up with the owner, Peter, himself! They usually get super pissed about the situation when it's late and nothing's open?  However, not with us!  Hopefully they give the owner an earful at checkout? \n\nI also gave the guy's motel a bad TripAdvisor review complete with photos! In fact, I took one of him when he was raging and waving his arms about with an angry face.  I included that one in review.  Captioned 'Ownership Hospitality'\n\nI don't know if I'm still trespassed? It's been almost two years.  However, on nice days when I drive by and he's sitting on the front porch, I love honking the horn and yelling \"Hey Peter! Go fuck yourself!  By the time he looks up, I've gone past and he doesn't know who it is.\n",

        "text": "I've been delivering pizza for a long time. Sixteen years to be exact. Enough time to have seen just about everything.  I've dealt with so many jerkoff customers and non-tippers, idiots, etc. that they usually don't even phase me at this point. Just part of the job! No reason to get bent out of shape and disgruntled with the job.\n\nHowever, there's one former customer who was just too much! After delivering to thousands of customers over the years, he's the only one that I've had to draw a line and refuse to deliver to. I've dealt with plenty of people who can't be pleased, repeatedly complain, etc. but this guy was something else! An asshole from the major leagues!\n\nI first met Mr. Rockie ( Yes, that's his last name) when I started a new gig at a regional chain in New England. He and his wife would always order two dozen Buffalo Wings every few weeks. \n\nThe first three times I delivered to him, he'd called back to complain about his order.  By the fourth time, I had remembered the address and made sure to double check all his orders to make sure everything was o.k. before leaving. After all, the guy always tipped really well and I felt bad that all three deliveries I'd made to him were messed up.\n\nSure enough, I came back from my fourth time delivering to him and he'd called to complain that the well done wings were way overcooked, and furthermore, out of his two dozen wings, only 10 of them were actual wings.  The rest were legs! He was given a credit.\n\nThe fifth time, I tried to drop it off and get out of there as quickly as possible before he could find a problem. It's what I call the \"drop and roll.\"  However, just as I was opening the door to my car, I hear him whistle to me, \"Hey Kid\" (I was no kid. I was 33 years old. Only two years younger than this guy... I learned his age his age when he appeared in the local town paper's 'weekly arrests' blog when he got popped for domestic violence) I go back, and as usual he's not pleased. He's got the box of wings open and asks me what's wrong with this picture?  I look. Dumbfounded, I don't see anything wrong and tell him they look like our Wings always look? He then proceeds to point out that there's more legs than wings! I explain to him that they come frozen, portioned in a bag, and that's just how they come. -We sell lots of them and nobody has ever had issue- I apologize, and finally ten minutes later, I'm back in the car with my two other deliveries getting late. \n\nAs the months went on, so did his wing orders.  I eventually started keeping track and was up to 13 deliveries, where each time he'd have to inspect the wings, only to find there were more legs than wings! Or they were overcooked. Too cold. Too Late. Whatever? \n\nHe eventually started lecturing me about how we were false advertising, because he reasoned that if we are advertising Buffalo wings, than they should be 100% wings! I eventually stopped trying to reason with him. This routine was taking up too much of my time and patience. Each time, I was spending more and more time at his door listening to the same complaints. Eventually I referred him to my GM, and than later to our corporate offices after he called the GM, didn't get anywhere and let me know that he thought our GM was \"a real cock\" but that I was pretty cool.\n\nThen one day he calls for the usual delivery from us.  This time it was during Saturday evening dinner rush and I had three orders in the car and was running late.  \n\nMr. Rockie meets me in the yard holding a handheld three pronged garden weeder.  He opens the box with his two dozen wings to inspect them, but instead of a quick look over, he takes the garden weeder and uses it to individually turn over and inspect both sides of all 50 Buffalo wings.    Of course same issue as always... Too many damn legs!  \"What's with this BS?\" \n\nThe same old false advertising lecturing starts. The same speech about false advertising I've heard a dozen times already. He then proceeds to inform me that I might have noticed that my tips have been getting less and less, and because of this, I'm getting a dollar this time and none next time if it happens again! As always, I apologize and remain pleasant. I again refer him to our corporate offices where we have a  full time operations manager who is paid to take calls and emails from angry customers and act like they care. All the while I'm trying to act genuinely concerned, while I'm really seething inside.\n\nThe final time was a few weeks later.  This time his wife comes to the door. She was actually really nice. They'd been warned after he called back the last time that we couldn't promise all wings.  Just as I'm about to get out of there, I hear Mr. Rockie screaming out the door to check the damn wings!  The door comes flying open, almost comes off the hinges and the guy comes storming out. He throws open the box and you guessed it, as always, same problem! At this point his jugular is starting to protrude from his neck and he completely goes off the hook at me. His wife is begging him to stop making a production, but not before he unleashed a tirade of profanities and rage over this \"BS\", as he put it.  \n\nFor the first time, I finally showed a hint of irritation. I apologized, but told him firmly for once that \"I only deliver the food. We've gone through this many times and I can't help you. I have no authority and you need to take it up with our corporate offices, because there's nothing I can do for you! We sell a lot of these!  You're the only one who has ever complained, and if we can't satisfy you than perhaps I recommend you don't buy our wings anymore? I'm done with this conversation Have a wonderful evening, Sir\"\n\nWhile his wife profusely apologized, he chucked the wings through the door while waving his arms around and yelling like a madman. I just turned my back and left.\n\nI went back to the store and told them the regular story. But this time I let them know he was now acting hostile and vaguely threatening. I said that if they wouldn't black list him, than I refused to deliver on my shifts. After fifteen reoccurrences of the same delivery, I'd finally had enough! \n\nI might have kept delivering to him, but when my tips started going down and he actually had the nerve to rub it in my face and let me me know straight out that he won't be tipping, than that was the last stand.  I wasn't particularly afraid of by him, but, just because I could, when he decided to rage, I decided I'd just tell me boss that felt threatened by him and unsafe delivering to him! That was all I had to say. After months of suggesting we blacklist him to no avail, suddenly my GM agreed to let me! Being the only driver in my store, well, I guess that puts him shit out of luck?  No more deliveries for you! Congratulations , the only customer I've refused service to in 16 years! \n\nIt's been almost two years now.  About once per year, his wife calls and asks for delivery.  We have them blacklisted in the computer and she's told we can no longer deliver to that address and can offer pickup only. Each time, she tries to persuade us that was a long time ago, she's sorry, and he doesn't live there anymore. Just recently she called at dinner rush and spent 15 minutes on the phone with the GM begging for delivery. She wouldn't take no for an answer. Even when told our driver, me, straight out refused to deliver to her. \"What do you want us to do? Force him?\",  my GM asked her?  Eventually she came and picked it up. I saw her come in and I quickly disappeared out back.  I wanted nothing to do with it.  \n\nNow she wants me to call her so she can personally apologize for he husband being ridiculous, but that don't matter.  As nice as she is, I'm done with her address! Plus, I know she's lying because little does she know, I live just down the street and still see her husband in the driveway all the time!\n\nI can put up with a lot. But as soon as a customer has the nerve to actually tell me beforehand, straight up that they're no longer going to tip me for my services because they're unhappy with something's that's out of my control, well NO MORE DELIVERIES FOR YOU! Rockie should have just kept his mouth shut!\n",
