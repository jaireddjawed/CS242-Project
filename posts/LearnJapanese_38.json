        "text": "Recently I started doing online tutoring sessions, and one of the things I was excited about was the prospect of being able to ask about specific issues I've been having trouble with. But when I tried asking my tutor a few things he didn't seem to understand, and then afterward he canceled all of our upcoming sessions. I think this was just a one-off but I wanted to make sure I didn't commit a faux pas or something.\n\nFor the record I wanted to know:\n\n1. How to say that I changed my mind about something I said earlier.\n2. How to switch from asking questions about my specific situation to asking about possible hypothetical situations.\n\nThere should be tutors out there who would answer those questions right?",

Example if you were to use the kanji for origin followed by spirit would it literally read as origin spirit or would it just come off as gibberish? I know kanji is more used as speaking using concepts than actual words but I would really like if someone could help me clarify that.",

But I wanted to ask about writing Japanese names as someone with minimal kanji knowledge.  So it seems like beyond just common nouns, both first and last names also have kanji.  If this is the case, should this be integrated into learning early?  How many names should you be able to recognize by the time you‚Äôre an N4?  \n\nAlso when looking up the kanji for a name (Akira) I‚Äôm given several Kanji ‚Äúoptions‚Äù just for 1 first name.  Is this common for all first names?  What about last names?  Or am I just over thinking this and should focus on common nouns until I‚Äôm more comfortable with the language?",

Then it would take the highest kanken level of the searched kanji as the reference level of difficulty for this word.  (So in this case the word above would be classified as \"kanken level 9\", as both kanji in that word belong to this level according to that list). \n\nThis would be sort of a universal method to classify japanese words by difficulty (as long as you're familiarized with Kanken) without having to classify them in multiple types of lists, but unfortunately I don't know how to do that :')\n\nI thought about writing this in case any japanese learner here happens to be a programmer and wants to take up the challenge.

        "author": "Rowan-Red",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/yt5zuy/linguistics_graduates_reflection_on_learning/",
        "text": "Hi all, I have lurked here for a long time and want to offer my two cents on a few things I suppose, in the hopes that people might be able to re-motivate themselves to keep learning and not make the same mistakes I made over the years. I will start by chronicling my background and then go on to discuss Linguistics with a scope on Japanese learning.\n\n**Background**\n\nI have studied Japanese, English, Linguistics, and TESOL at university. Over the past 4 years and more, I have repeatedly tried to keep learning - keep the motivation going and not give up.\n\nDue to poor mental health, it has been an on-and-off experience leading to eternal frustration in not being able to escape a low level of Japanese - but it never stopped me from consuming Japanese media of all sorts - and thus the end result of years of trying to learn has surmounted to only a 'decent' amount of acquisition of vocabulary through 'too much listening practice' - to put it in simple terms.\n\n**Learning imbalance** \n\nOver saturation of listening has taught me something though, that I let the lazy element of my brain take over, which made me satisfied to engage in one just aspect of learning a language that was 'too easy', which scratched the itch of doing some learning of some form, which resulted in me neglecting proper active learning.\n\nI find myself being able to understand a hell of a lot of Japanese news, television shows, animations, documentaries. I often test myself by turning away from the screen with the main concept of the content in mind, and it was/is so satisfying to be able to understand quite a lot of vocabulary and grammar too. This makes me very motivated, but I hit a brick wall when I try to tackle intermediate grammar and kanji - it drains my soul - but at the end of this post after sprawling out my reflections I will lay out the land of how I am going to try and change this.\n\n**Learner apprehension: Speaking**  \n\nThose of us who struggle with mental health whether it be bouts of depression, social anxiety and so forth are at a massive disadvantage when it comes to learning a second language, because language is of course in essence all about interaction and engagement with human beings, unless of course ones goals are solely for reading or watching content in the target language.\n\nMy advice for those who struggle in this way is to look at it this way: what is more powerful: *regret*, or a *fleeting* *moment of nervousness?* I was terrified of speaking to people, I still am (anxiety), I worry about what they think of me, my looks, mannerisms, what mistakes might I make? But in time, these flimsy emotions that come and go like the wind are not as much of a burden as the burn of regret that you will carry for years if you do not practice speaking with native speakers sooner than later. This has helped me get a grip and try visualize my anxiety as an uncomfortable pebble in my shoe, but if i do not keep marching on the regret of making no progress on my journey will be more painful.\n\nThe frustration of being able to comprehend a conversation right in front of you, but not be able to engage in said conversation? I thought to myself recently, \"imagine if I had seriously studied consistently for the past 5 years, practiced speaking, reading, writing..\" - that thought made me feel grim. Use the potential or already present regret as a tool to change the future, do not let it become a weapon that carves into you!\n\nThe literature in the field of linguistics debates early reading and speaking, but casting my mind back I remember some studies did find that those who started reading at an earlier point and read what they enjoyed did better than a class that did not - pleasure reading, as Krashen put it (and I believe the study in mention was in fact co-written by him).\n\n**Decisive action over constant research**\n\nOne thing I learned on my degree and in practice is the concept of \"communities of practice\". In fact, I wrote an essay about how Reddit and this Sub Reddit among others qualify as such. You can imagine it as a place or group which has a common goal and works together to reach X, Y and Z.\n\nReddit has been indispensable in helping me with burning grammar questions, but as you may have noticed there is a prolific trend - \"what is the best resource\" - \"what is the best method?\" and so on. I would dub it something like 'silver-bulletism'. I was guilty of this and still am - I spend hours browsing online scouring for the most optimal resources based on a range of testimonies, trying to find my silver bullets that will finally allow me to nail Japanese on the head and learn quickly.\n\nBut then, there is the age of debates that rise up, the X method is best, Y resource is best - which sends us into disarray and uncertainty, making us look up more and more testimonies and albeit subjective experiences of others with X, Y, and Z.\n\nMy advice in this area is to just relax and remember how long the road is. The main objective is to use something that will allow incremental acquisition of knowledge - basic grammar and vocabulary, for you to then build upon. There will always be people who will say \"nah but this is way better than that textbook bro\" - but we are all our own person, with our own time frames and circumstances to learn within and around. Settle on one textbook and worry about diversifying your resources when you have a basic repertoire of knowledge - our mental lexicons cannot be brute forced.\n\nCultivate your short term and long term memory for vocabulary through speaking, reading, and listening at the point where you have some vocab that you can use (at least, these are the prime trinity for my own goals). Anki for spaced repetition is wonderful and stimulates ST and LT memory, making sure you do not forget - **BUT** \\- if you do not invest in speaking and reading in their respective contexts where you are exposed to vocabulary, that holy trinity and prism's balance is imbalanced. This is what happened to me - too much listening, not enough reading, hardly and speaking - and now i feel trapped in not being able to communicate properly in the language I love.\n\n**What I have learned from Linguistics and the time on my degree**\n\nEarly reading and early speaking is not as detrimental as some argue, as discussed in some studies (google scholar is a gold mine if you are interested in L2 acquisition and Linguistics in general) . The essence of language is interaction and communication, and I will give an example:\n\nMy course-mates were all motivated by different things, and when I studied the programme which had a heavier weighting on Japanese than Linguistics, I came across a wide range of people, exotic to say the least to a country bumpkin like myself. Some loved Anime, some loved Japanese music, others loved the more traditional and historical aspects of Japan. I changed programme and did not do my year abroad in Japan due to my mental health and family situation at the time, but I still shared modules and spent time with the people who did go and came back from their year in Japan.\n\nCoursemate A and B: They both spent the same amount of time in Japan, but lived very differently there. *A* lived in non-halls environment, *B* did. *A* played games far too much instead of study, *B* studied and hardly played games (Steam activity and time played confirmed this..). You get the picture I am sure - both lived in Japan for the same time in the *prime* environment for learning Japanese at a better pace than those who have to in their own country, but when *A* came back to complete their final year, there were people who were still in their first year who spoke more Japanese and understood more Japanese, etc. *B* however went out, made friends, networked, and studied hard and they came back at a middle to high intermediate of Japanese, which was impressive to see coming from complete beginner level originally.\n\nThe moral of this story is that just being in Japan is not enough and the knowledge does not magically flow into you every time you have to buy food from 7/11 or walk through the streets, you have to engage yourself and interact with real humans and content. This links back to my premise of early interaction in regards to speaking practice. This can also be applied to how you use your time even if you are not in Japan - find a study partner online, the apps are there to do so (HellotTalk to name one) - if you have the disposable income, pay for a tutor to keep the ball rolling and build your confidence because it is certainly worth it, i have seen the results in those who have invested in this and it does help, not to say that it would be beneficial for everyone with their respective goals and levels.\n\n\\- (keep in mind these mistakes in learning etc apply to me too hence my long reflection)\n\n**How I aim to try again with a clean slate**\n\nI have stopped my repeating search for a good resource and methodology which promises the quickest way to learn Japanese, and while my mind is always plagued with doubt I will lay out what I have decided on doing.\n\nI used to agree that Heisig was a waste of time, and I thought brute forcing massive anki decks was the trick. I understand that learning kanji in context is optimal and necessary, but my brain just cannot do it.\n\nIn the summer of 2021 I did a Memrise course which focused on teaching some of the most frequent Heisig kanji, and I made my own stories about them to make the Kanji more memorable. Yesterday (12/11/2022) I decided to revisit it finally and see if I remembered something. Amazingly, I just somehow new them or in some instances actually could recall the right answers - the silly or daft stories I created came to my mind when I looked at some of the Kanji.\n\nIn reality i wish i did not have to learn kanji this way, it is a time sink, but my brain needs to do it this way as a building block, and then I aim to go onto learning the readings in context where I know there characters. If it has helped me recognize them when I could not doing it any other way then that is what i must do. Taking my own time and pace and realizing it is a life long journey anyway is what i will keep in the forefront of my mind - Japan and its language, its media or culture is not going anywhere any time soon but my time is!\n\nI have collected every resource and recommendation under the sun from this Sub and compiled them over the years like a maniacal squirrel hoarding magic shiny acorns, without actually using them properly. So I have narrowed down my approach and resources and decided to commit to them this time, and as aforementioned i will be rectifying my mistake of not practicing conversation/speaking and not reading enough too, as well as investing in a tutor at some point because as someone with anxiety it will help build a bridge of confidence for me.\n\n**\\~** In time I hope to make a follow up post on my progress albeit while under the duress of a full-time job with more worldly responsibilities than when i was a naive and young student. Now that I have limited time to study, i think that funnily enough that i might have a more structured approach now that i am scared of wasting time!\n\n**TLDR:** Use your time wisely and efficiently, don't research learning resources and methods to death, remember the feeling of regret from not making a change sooner rather than later - but as I said, regret is to be a tool rather than a weapon of self- flagellation - I am using my regret as a tool to try and start anew with realistic expectations in telling myself its better late than never. Do not beat yourself up from slow progress, use the approach that you feel comfortable with and that works for you.\n\nKeep in mind I am no guru, this is a post from someone who has failed to succeed in their goals, but I want to my reflection upon said failure to serve and example as i see the apprehension beginners and beyond have and the battle of motivation \\~\n\nThanks for reading :\\^)",

        "text": "I'm fluent in Japanese, but I'm helping out some friends who are beginner/intermediate. They're getting good grammar and vocabulary from their textbooks and official classes, but they were struggling with how spoken Japanese doesn't sound like what's in their textbooks, so they asked me to help them with a dialogue, and that turned into a weekly spoken dialogue lesson. I'm not talking about slang, exactly, but differences like:  \n  \nTextbook:  \n„ÄåÂ§™ÈÉé„ÅØ„Çà„Åè„Çè„Åã„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®Ë®Ä„Å£„Åü„Äç  \nSpoken:  \n„ÄåÂ§™ÈÉé„ÅØ„Çà„Åè„Çè„Åã„Å£„Å¶„Çã„Å£„Å¶„Äç  \n  \nSo things like \"„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã‚Üí„Å¶„Çã\", \"„Å¶„ÅØ‚Üí„Å°„ÇÉ\", \"Ë®Ä„Å£„Åü‚Üí„ÇÜ„Å£„Åü\", phrases like \"„Å†„Å£„Å¶...„Å†„ÇÇ„Çì,\" natural places to drop \"„ÅØ\" or \"„Åå\" or \"„Çí\", that kind of thing.  \n  \nThe way we've been doing it so far is they've been bringing me dialogues from duolingo, and I go over them and explain the spoken language parts that they don't understand. The dialogues have actually been *really* helpful. Very simple Japanese, but very natural, so they can focus on the spoken Japanese elements without getting hung up on difficult grammar or vocab.  \n  \nHowever, apparently Duolingo has done something different recently and now there are no more dialogues, so we have no material to work with.  \n  \nSo here's my question: Does anyone have any sources of *short*, *simple*, *natural* dialogues? If worst comes to worst I considered simply transcribing really short sections of „Çµ„Ç∂„Ç®„Åï„Çì, but it seems like I might be reinventing the wheel and there could be a site that already has exactly what I'm looking for.  \n  \nI don't need any explanations about the dialogues (though, of course, if the site has an explanation that wouldn't be a drawback, either), the dialogues just have to be short, easy(ish), and, above all, *natural*.  \n  \nFor reference, here's one of the Duolingo dialogues we worked on:  \n  \n„Å¥„Å£„Åü„Çä„Å™ ‰∫∫  \n„Éì„Éº„ÅØ Âèã„Å†„Å°„ÅÆ „Ç®„Éá„Ç£ „Å´ ‰ºö„ÅÑ„Å´ „Ç´„Éï„Çß „Å´ Êù•„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ  \nEDDIE:  „Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ„ÄÅ„Éì„ÉºÔºÅ  \nBEA:  „Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ„ÄÅ„Ç®„Éá„Ç£ÔºÅÊúÄËøë„ÄÅ„Å©„ÅÜÔºü  \nEDDIE:  ÂÆü„ÅØ„ÄÅ‰ªäÊô© „Éá„Éº„Éà„Å™„Çì„Å†„ÄÇ  \nBEA:  „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Å≠ÔºÅ  \nEDDIE:  „ÅÜ„Çì„ÄÅ„Åß„ÇÇ „Å°„Çá„Å£„Å® „Åê„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„Åå ÊÇ™„Åè„Å¶‚Ä¶  \nBEA:  „Åà„Å£„ÄÅÂ§ß‰∏àÂ§´Ôºü  \nEDDIE:  „Åô„Åî„Åè „Å†„Çã„Åè„Å¶„ÄÅ„Åï„ÇÄ„Åë„Åå „Åô„Çã„Çì„Å†„ÄÇ  \nBEA:  „ÅÜÔΩû„Çì„ÄÇ„Åæ„Åö„ÅÑ„Å≠„ÄÇ„ÅäÂåªËÄÖ„Åï„Çì „Å´ Ë°å„Å£„Åü„Åª„ÅÜ„Åå „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çà„ÄÇ  \nEDDIE:  „ÅÑ„ÇÑ„ÄÅÂ§ß‰∏àÂ§´„Çà„ÄÇ„Åù„Çå„Å´„ÄÅ„Åì„Çì„Å∞„Çì „Éá„Éº„Éà„Å†„ÅóÔºÅ  \nBEA:  „Éá„Éº„Éà„ÅØ „Åæ„Åü „Åì„Çì„Å© „Åß„Åç„Çã „Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜÔºü „Åù„Çå„Å´„ÄÅÁßÅ„ÄÅ„Ç®„Éá„Ç£„Å´ „Å¥„Å£„Åü„Çä„Å™ ‰∫∫ Áü•„Å£„Å¶„Çã„Çà„ÄÇ  \nEDDIE:  „Åª„Çì„Å®Ôºü  \nBEA:  „ÅÜ„Çì„ÄÇËÉå„Åå È´ò„Åè„Å¶„ÄÅÈ†≠„ÇÇ „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çà  \nEDDIE:  „É¶„Éº„É¢„Ç¢„ÅÆ „Çª„É≥„Çπ „ÇÇ „ÅÇ„ÇãÔºü  \nBEA:  „ÅÜ„Çì„ÄÇ„Åô„Å£„Åî„Åè „Åä„ÇÇ„Åó„Çç„ÅÑ„Çà„ÄÇ  \nEDDIE:  Êú¨ÂΩì„Å´ „Å¥„Å£„Åü„Çä„Å†„Å≠ÔºÅÂêçÂâç„ÅØÔºü  \nBEA:  „Çµ„É≥„Éà„Çπ ÂÖàÁîü „Å†„Çà„ÄÇ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„Åê „Çµ„É≥„Éà„Çπ ÂÖàÁîü „Å´ ‰ºö„ÅÑ„Å´ Ë°å„Å£„Åü„Åª„ÅÜ„Åå „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çà„ÄÇ„Å†„Å£„Å¶„ÄÅÁóÖÊ∞ó„Å†„ÇÇ„ÇìÔºÅ",

She explained all their clients are gaijins already because they are not japanese.

The company I work for has their global headquarters based in Osaka, I work at the North America Regional headquarters (technically WFH, but I digress).\n\nBecause of this arrangement, there are a significant amount of native expats from Japan that rotate in and out of the US offices on a 3-year basis. You can generally find a ~10-20% population of native Japanese in each US office.\n\nI've been studying on and off for the past year, but have since lost my motivation. I really do think it would be a useful skill for me to learn, and help me bridge the language/culture gap with non-native coworkers.\n\nMy boss even pointed out that if I learned to a level of fluency, my skills would be even more valuable to the company. It is rare that someone outside of the Japan HQ offices goes out of their way to learn the language. Boss even implied that the Global offices might start calling on me more often, maybe to fly out and visit?\n\ntl;dr\n\nI want to learn Japanese to a level of proficiency where I can comfortably interact with native speakers at my workplace. Vocabulary would need to involve technology to some extent (I work in IT Security).\n\nWhat are the best strategies for reaching this goal? Self-taught? See if one of my coworkers wants to tutor? \n\nMy job even covers tuition expenses for schooling, so it stands to reason that they would cover part of the cost for an actual Classroom experience. Would this be as effective as other methods?",

My training in Japanese has mainly focused on reading skills and modern Japanese grammar (i.e. I never learned *Bungo*).\n\nNow, as I said, I do read pre-1945 texts quite regularly. Fortunately for me, these use a lot of Kanji and kana mainly for grammatical purposes. In terms of grammar, I have found that apart from certain irregularities now and then, I can read these texts without too much problem based on my knowledge of modern Japanese grammar. As I understand it, by the early 20th century, *bungo* was starting to fade out of use, which would explain why I don't seem to have many problems understanding the texts I am reading grammatically (a reply in the post above also seems to say that the text in question (from the 1930s) uses modern grammar and not *bungo*).

I know how important is reading for real understanding of a language and because of that I want to start reading as fast as possible. After 3 years of german, even tho I wasnt a good student (B and D grades mostly) I can comfortably read some webtoons, and even books if I search for some words I dont know. But I cant really do it with Japanese. Ive been studying for some time before starting Uni, my anki says I know a bit above 2k words right now. I'd like to start reading some books or maybe at least manga but I dont find it really possible. Im not sure where really lies the problem, because 2K words should be enough to understand some simple manga, but I cant really understand even a single sentence and read comfortably. Im quite sure that I know way less german words than japan after those 3 years of not really paying attention in school, but still reading in german is way more comfortable, so Im not really sure where lies the problem? Its not like I dont recognize the kanji of words I already know, but still it seems like in Japanese its just way harder for some reason? Or maybe this language just is built this way that it requiers way more words to start reading in it?. I'd like to ask you all here, how many words/characters have you known when you started reading in Japanese? I don't really find it amusing or worth the time if I have to spend few minutes on every single sentence because of rewriting and looking up all the kanji.",

Specifically Japanese YouTuber courses. \n\nEg: That Japanese Man Yuta‚Äôs premium Japanese course \n\nDogen‚Äôs pitch accent course\n\nSteve Kaufmann‚Äôs LinQ membership\n\nJapanesepod101.com\n\nI personally have Yuta‚Äôs premium Japanese course and it is pretty insanely detailed, yet simple to follow along. Lots of focus on real life speaking, keigo/non-keigo speech, and constant feedback. 24 chapters with each chapter having 6-20 units each. It will honestly probably take me a year to work through it. The course isn‚Äôt necessarily vocabulary focused, but it seems more than enough if you‚Äôre able to immerse yourself with other listening exercises.\n\nJust looking to share some experiences!",

Should I take these scores with a grain of salt? I've also been studying with the Sou Matome N3 series and find that the reading and listening books seem a bit easy as well. \n\nAny tips or suggestions as the N3 exam date approaches?\n\nThanks!",

I was just thinking of the best games to get for learning Japanese to see if I was missing any hidden gems, or just for beginners (like myself) to refer to this on their journey to learning Japanese. If anyone had game scripts for any of the games you recommend that would be amazing too, just to help as many people be able to access Japanese through gaming as possible, if no though, don't worry.",

        "text": "So for the past year or two I've focused hard on trying to learn Kanji and Vocab since I used to struggle with those in college. My methods being Anki and Wanikani (double duty for vocab) and while I've made significant progress I always seem to run into the issue of comprehension.\n\nI'll be able to read a sentence or two without issues but then come across one where I recognize nothing. No big deal, I'll add any words that I don't know to my deck and if I don't know the kanji I'll just wait until I learn it. I'll then go to places like BunPro to brush up on grammar however notice myself memorizing the sentences and not the actual grammar. I can't seem to apply them anywhere outside of simple contexts and did the same with math in school where I could use a formula in one example but be unable to in other instances.\n\nSo then I think, \"am I studying the wrong way?\" since it feels like I'm progressing in terms of metrics based off the studying tools I use but in real world like I'm stuck in place. Technically I **am** progressing since Anki says I know around 3500 words and Wanikani around 2500 words (so I **should** know around 5000 given overlap of vocab) but I still struggle.\n\nI'm hoping that when I finish Wanikani by the end of next year and also get to almost 10k words I should \"start getting it\", but I have a feeling like that's not going to happen and I'm missing something. My hope is that if I cram enough information in \"someday\" I might understand more complex sentences. Has anyone else gone through this phrase, since this feels like the \"intermediate plateau\" but extended.",
