Thanks in advance!\n\nAs far as I can remember, there's two people, a woman (the bassist, singer) and a man (the singer). They're both white or caucasion or looked like they are (I don't know their ethnicity, just that they're probably American and definitely didn't look black nor asian). They have many chill songs and their youtube had a lot of music videos titled visualizer instead of music video. There was one black and white music video where he sang while she's just hula hooping throughout the 2+ minutes video non-stop. They also made a music video tinged in purple while walking through shrubs. But the most notable thing I can recall was that they came up with a four-track release with a theme of astronaut, cowboy, ballet dancer and something. One of the title of the songs were Astronaut, Georgie (or something like this).",

Unfortunately that didn't happen and later he gave up his dream to pursue being a father and teacher. fast forward to earlier this year when I for the first time got to hear his music, I was very impressed as the song I heard was REALLY good. I convinced him to upload all of his songs to Spotify and that´s where we are today. In 1 week it is his birthday and I wanted to give him the best gift ever. The link is at the start of the post and both me and my dad would greatly appreciate if you went and took a listen to one of the songs (my favorites are \"While you're pickin' your nose\" and \"Manchester Robin\").\n\nMaraeze!",

Note that I am not mentioning Chester Bennington, because I think his voice speaks for itself:\n\nBoston - More than a feeling (extremely high note).\nJeff Buckley - Hallelujah cover (holds a very long, perfect note at the end).\nLow Roar - Dreamer (very melodic, soothing voice).\nTool - Jerk Off (you know the part).\nPara Noir - Marilyn Manson (screams in extremely high note near the end).\n\nLet me know!",
