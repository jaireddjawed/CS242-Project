Also, what exaclty is a singularity ? \n\nFor what i understand, its a question of masse and gravity but it's really unclear.\n\n( sorry if i made a few mistakes, english is not my native langage.

This applies an increasing velocity through space on all other objects towards itself.\n\nIf I understand the physics correctly, then we also know that two objects experiencing the same acceleration wouldn’t be able to tell that either object is accelerating.\n\nThis leads me to think that perhaps we’re being pulled through time towards some object. That is, we’re all universally experiencing the same temporal acceleration and therefore we’re unable to distinguish any other objects temporal acceleration.\n\nThe question then is, has this line of thinking been disproved already? And if not, has it been pursued at all or would it be worth pursuing?\n\nI hadn’t considered the effect this would have on entropy. Or perhaps entropy is already the explanation for the unidirectionality of time. Idk",

There really is no Pascal/Hooke/Stefan/Newton's LAWS that are acting as constraints on the universe. No top down application and ruling. Everything comes from the smallest base unit of existence and every \"law\" we've found is a pattern matching equation to describe that phenomena, not a law that governs that phenomena. Swams of the most base thing, not monarchs organizing laws, are creating the regular ordering of everything.  \n\n\nIt doesn't appear the universe is \"programmed\" with multiple laws of physics; rather, seems like at different levels patterns emerge that are built up from the fundamental basis for that which reality is \"built on.\" I think that is one way to distinguish reality from simulation. Simulation uses these equations to govern. In reality they aren't laws but patterns. So yes we can \"obey the laws of gravity\" but we would be more accurate to say, \"we aligned with the pattern of gravity.\"  \n\n\nDo you agree disagree?

If light is emitted in the form of EM radiation every time an electron is excited and then returns to its normal state. How are there gradients of brightness and darkness? I’m thinking there really can’t be that many electrons around most atoms, are they just interacting extremely quickly? On what kind of scale? It doesn’t have to pertain specifically to this picture because I’m pretty sure it’s a reconstruction. But in any gradient of light where it seems to get darker from a focused point, how can spots be brighter if every EM wave is a photon producing light? Is there literally trillions of photons making up a density gradient that appears brighter where it’s focused? \n\nI’m having trouble comprehending this idea, I recently saw a video of a laser or something propagating through water, and again there’s a bright point which I assume is a beam of photons, from the brighter center of the beam there’s a gradient of brightness that dims. Is that just fewer photons interacting with the h2o molecules that maybe shot off in a different direction?",

This is shown by simple algebra in my video.\n\nHowever, in our Einsteinian and Newtonian models,  we approximate the mass of a system by looking at the acceleration towards the gravitational center. This means that if the masses are spread along a greater distance - we will estimate a greater mass, hence the prediction of dark matter.\n\nIf any astrophysicists would like to work with me to write a paper on this, using the data on rotation of star in galaxies that we have for a formal proof that dark matter doesn't exist, please contact me by email at [pedro.loparic@gmail.com](mailto:pedro.loparic@gmail.com)",

So the passing time would be the movement of our universe along the 4d object of past and future.\nIn this theory there is a single past, but infinite possible futures, the 3d universe moves along the object like a saw debranching a tree, turning a lot of possible futures into a single past. This makes me think of entropy, wouldn't it be reasonable to think that this model could explain why the \"physical entropy inside our universe is aways growing? \n\nTldr: could the ever growing entropy of our universe be driven by an ever reducing \"time entropy\" caused by the fact that there is a single past but many possibile futures(reducing therefore the temporal entropy of the universe??",

So to change the frequency(AKA the speed at which matter is transmitted across space) you need to either add energy or remove it. When matter comes across a stretch of space that's bent by gravity, it's like it encounters a material where it can vibrate at a higher energy and it will naturally follow the path of less resistance. I wish i could meet someone willing to write down and test this theory.. if someone out there reads this.",

        "text": "I am working on a rocketry problem (not homework, just a nerd). Between high school and university I have about 7-8 years of physics/calculus under my belt, plus calculus-based statistics. I have taken an interest of late in understanding the physics of rocket propulsion and in particular how to build some of the multivariable formulas for the forces and kinematics involved. While I am by no means naïve to the fact that I will never be able to learn this stuff well enough to build a formula that accounts for more than few different factors involved, I want to get as far as I can. However, I've reached my first impasse. I started by treating gravity as constant and was able to build an acceleration formula which was based off mass as a function of time and derive to get velocity and distance, but now I'm trying to factor in Newton's gravitation formula and am stuck.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, lets pretend thrust is constant. With a simple F=ma I can get that net acceleration = (acceleration of thrust / mass) - acceleration of gravity. Alternatively, the net force = thrust - force of gravity. Cool. Easy. However, when we apply that to a rocketry context, mass is a variable function of time (rocket mass + fuel mass - \\[mass of fuel expended per second \\* time\\]), but the negative acceleration of gravity is a function of distance and not time (GM/r\\^2). I cannot seem to find an effective way to substitute either of these variables with some formula in order to convert this 2-variable function into a single-variable function. Converting to forces instead of acceleration does not help because it eliminates mass and therefore time as a factor in the thrust, but then Newton's gravitation formula becomes a function of mass and therefore time.\n\nSo, in short, you essentially get a = f(t) - g(x). Integrating only f(t) would give me velocity. Integrating only g(x) would give me W/m which I can then convert to velocity via conservation of energy. But where both variables exist in a single formula, is there any possible way to convert my acceleration formula to velocity? And subsequently to distance? Can I simply double-integrate and if so what is the resulting function a formula for? Am I missing some way to eliminate or convert one of my variables to reduce this to a single-variable function? Or is it simply the case that I have reached the point where this isn't even a physics impasse but a calculus impasse, and my recollection of multivariable calculus is failing me?\n\nAny help is appreciated. If the answer really is just \"you've crossed the line from the amateur physics of rocketry into rocket science itself and you should stop,\" that's helpful too.",

What’s interesting is that when I threw a heavier ball (7.3 kg) at 22km/h, which has 136.31 J of kinetic energy, the ball instead rammed through the pins and I got a strike. \n\nI’m interested to know why this happens because shouldn’t the lighter ball have more kinetic energy and thus plough through the pins better? Or are there other factors like momentum that affects the energy imparted to the pins?",
