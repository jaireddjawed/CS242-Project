That is basically quoting \"There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land...\" Deuteronomy 15:11\n\nThen I found many if not most what Jesus said seems to be quoting the Old Testament, as I started to read it. Paul does the same, but on a lesser extent, sometimes paraphrasing Jesus.\n\nI wonder how such a different religion came from someone who seem to just preach what the Torah already said. Not only that, but most Jewish values are also very different from those of Christianity and Islam.\n\nWe also have to consider that a lot of Jewish denominations in Jesus times do not exist anymore. We forget that Jesus was talking on the context of Jews 2000 years ago, not Talmud arguments from the 1500s. Almost all Jews today came from the Pharisees, although the Samaritans still exist, they don't seem to consider themselves Jews, but their faith is parallel to that of Judaism.",

        "text": "The world is changing in rapid, unprecedented ways due to technology, and religion is no exception. For example:\n\n* The USA has seen a rapid rise in secularism since the dawn of the new millennium and the advent of the internet to most Americans' lives.\n* Russia has seen a major backlash to the anti-religious policies of Soviet Communism, in the form of both small and low-profile new religious movements, as well as a modest revival of [Russian Orthodox] Christian nationalism.\n* Speaking of ethnoreligions, while the revival and reconstruction of pagan faiths has not attracted large numbers, these faith communities have nevertheless become more vibrant and established, to the point of being granted legitimacy by national governments. For example, not only the Armenian government, but also the Armenian Apostolic Church, have given their official support to Armenian Neopaganism.\n* Islam, from what I can gather, is on the brink of a mass youth exodus, mostly to irreligion, but also to evangelical Christianity. Christian missionaries and atheist activists have both seen unprecedented gains in the Muslim world in recent years — unthinkable and rather dangerous only a few years ago\n\nAs above, so below. What's clear to me is that as the material and social worlds change drastically, many people are finding that old established forms of religious observance no longer meet their needs, either spiritual or mundane.\n\nI hear many people say, descriptively or prescriptively or both, that religion has no future, and will slowly but steadily disappear completely, or relegate itself to a tiny lunatic fringe. I'm skeptical of this. I'll grant that in the past, religious communities served many important communal and pragmatic functions for people, which have been superseded by other institutions, enabled by technology, which serve these functions more effectively, efficiently, and fairly.\n\nThat said, I don't see spirituality disappearing, even if it's not everyone's thing. This sentient existence is painful. It's reasonable for any given person to entertain the possibility that their lives, and all this pain, are an important part of some greater cosmic plan, because suffering for a greater purpose is always easier to bear than suffering pointlessly. Entertaining this possibility is my working definition of spirituality, and it's a highly subjective and personal thing. Taking this a step further, people feel validated by the company of people who enjoy the same things they do. Meeting and bonding with other people over a common flavor of spirituality is no exception. Hence, organized religion. And although most of organized religion's more practical functions have been superseded by secular institutions, providing a watering hole for people with a common spirituality is one function that isn't so easily replaced, and continues to attract those who feel this need.\n\nIt's never been more easy and acceptable than now to openly deny any taste for spirituality. Likewise, it's never been more easy and acceptable to affirm a taste for spirituality but, deny the need to meet with other people and share it. At the same time, there will always be people who *do* have a taste for a communally-shared spiritual vision. This is a good thing, because which of these three categories one falls into is largely a matter of temperament, and a world where more people can find a place in society that fits their temperament is a better and happier world, where more people reach their fullest potential. I can see a truly wise and loving Higher Power not only forgiving and abiding, but *respecting*, a highly analytical facts-not-feelings type of person settling on atheism, because it's most consistent with their principles and ways of engaging with the world. Looking at the data from Pew and Gallup polls, I see a rough and dynamic \"rule of thirds\" population pattern emerging, already well established in Europe and Northeast Asia, but increasingly in the Americas and other parts of the world as well:\n\n* 25%~50% Affiliated with an organized religious community\n* 25%~50% Spiritual-not-religious, a.k.a. ietist\n* 25%~50% Irreligious and non-spiritual\n\nIf current technological and developmental trends continue, I foresee a future world where no less than a quarter but no more than half of all human beings affiliate with some sort of organized religion, but abiding comfortably and congenially with the majority of the population who don't.\n\nThere are some things I'm still wondering about, though:\n\n1. In a world where authoritarian rule and strict hierarchy are no longer all-pervasive, what will the content of future religions' tenets look like? I foresee much see less emphasis on obedience, power distance, and a duty to proselytize.\n2. In a world where meeting with like-minded people is less local and more global and online, what will the structure of future religious gatherings tend to look like? Will most congregations be entirely online, without much of a physical building or other physical accoutrements at all?\n3. In a world where congregants are free to come and go as they please, will religious communities use more persuasion, rather than fear, indoctrination, and control of information, to retain members?\n4. In a world that is changing more rapidly than ever before, and possibly heading toward a technological singularity, will articles of faith become more flexible and open to interpretation and reinterpretation, rather than revealed and set once and for all?\n\nI'd love to hear some ideas, or read some published scholarly work, from folks who concur with me that religion has a future, but not necessarily in the form it has traditionally taken.",

At age 13 I started my battle with religion and I wholeheartedly mean this, it has saved my life in more ways than I can count.\n\nI no longer fear death and therefore, my mind can no longer use this against me. \n\nI am not suicidal. I am not depressed. I simply am. And I love it. \n\nI believe that when I die, whoever/whatever is out there, is ready for me. I will not die until then. This gives me a newfound freedom to do anything I want.\n\nI am not sure what I believe exactly. Do I believe in anything like the Christian god? I do not, I think the world started with the big bang and I think evolution is how we got here. Do I believe in reincarnation? I don't. All I know is that our lives are made out of something far bigger than science can work out. That part of us has to go somewhere. Wherever that is, I welcome it. \n\nI am not sure why I made this post. I just want to thank each one of you and give my respect to everyone who holds a religion, any religion, close to their heart. May it give you peace of mind and hope for the future. \n\nI cannot wait to see where we all end up after death.\n\nI will see you in this life or the next.",

I dont know but I do know that these are very difficult if not impossible to reduce to the physical. These are anomalies that seem very difficult to reconcile as being  purely evolutionary machines for propagating DNA. \n\n1  Search for meaning : Humans want to be a part of something that is greater than themself or others, something that is epic and beyond the mundane of life.  Humans like epic narratives and stories and like to feel like they are part of an epic narrative. To contribute to something beyond the physical. \n\n2 Search for happiness : Similiar to 1 but not the same, humans look for pleasure of various forms and types and are never satisfied, always looking for more and more novelty. Not only that but humans are consciously aware when they not satisfied. \n\n3 Search for knowledge &amp; truth : Humans have a passion for things that are pointless to their survival, things such as cosmology, human origins, biology and philosophy. \n\n4 Search for transcendence in art : This relates to 1 and 2. Humans tend to like and relate to metaphorical and idealized poetry, lyrics and music that conveys emotions words can't convey. Humans also like music and films like sci fi, superhero mythology, fantasy that evoke a feeling of transcending the mundane everyday life.\n\n5 Search for morality/spirituality : This also connects to 1 in that spirituality gives people meaning. In this case it is the desire to be altruistic or go out of the way for a moral cause not in a evolutionary scratch my back I scratch yours way. And the desire for spirituality in improving ones characters, seeking peace through the mystical and spiritual philosophies and through altruistic philosophies.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1129357/values_as_a_modern_replacement_for_gods_and_how/",
        "text": "I find it odd that often religious people, even in my own faith, use terms such as \"values\" while truth is that values are in a sense assumption that replace a God. However, if we look closely, values are a modern response to an unclear will of God. If we don't know what God wants, then we need values.\n\nIf you read the Bible and other religious books, they do not have values in the modern sense, but they have commandments. God says something and we do it. If there was a question or ambiguity, a priest was consulted, and often they developed legal traditions to derive rules. In this sense, the work of the priest was vital for a functional society.\n\nNietzche noticed this and that is why he attacked the idea of morality and even ethic assumptions in the same way he criticized religion.\n\nWe can also see how modern values are also fundamentally contradictory. Most notably, the value of Equality is almost always in contradiction with the value of appreciating Diversity, because diversity will always imply some inequality. This is no different from the contradictory and paradoxical properties found in a supernatural being, yet we have to accept this in a collective cognitive dissonance. In a more primitive view of this you could say that it is in the same way as in the past the Gods were on constant and eternal war.\n\nPeople may argue that values are not like religion because they don't imply supernatural elements, but that is not the point because metaphysical ideas can be considered as real as supernatural ideas from a materialist point of view, so psychologically it makes little to no difference.\n\nValues are at the same level of gods because they are metaphysical ideas, and the same arguments used against Gods or the supernatural can be used against values themselves. It is even weirder today, as new values are rising. This may explain why the often the secular countries have very strong values and regulations, as a compensation for religion.\n\nWe may argue that values today are better than religion and a good replacement for gods, but honestly, we are at a blind spot. Appreciating truth, logic, empathy, etc. are also values themselves. Sure, you can base your values on empathy, and yet that empathy can be used to defend criminals from justice, just as we can have no empathy for things and being that do deserve it. Empathy seems a very weak way to have a value. We may appeal to logic, but logic may also imply some inhuman values, such as euthanasia of disabled people as \"logically\" it saves resources.\n\nMy point in this essay is not to defend religion but defend why religion was so important in the past and why so many people still have it today. \n\nRemember that many \"superior\" values we have today are only possible with technology. After factories and machines were developed, we started to be able to get rid of slavery, as workers were cheaper to maintain in a industrialized world. In the same way many of the feminists revolutions only took root after the pill was invented. In the past cheating and adultery was such a big crime, but not anymore as we have the pill, abortion and paternity tests. The past had a logical and expected reaction to adultery without any technology to handle it.\n\nNow, visualize if we ban meat and the future of humanity judges us for being \"savages\" for eating meat. They would quote that vegan existed, so we were evil for eating meat, yet they say that from a world where meat is grown artificially, and it is cheaper than growing animals.\n\nYou can see how new \"values\" are just logical adaptations to technology, a luxury.",

Atheists just won't accept it\" is narcissistic and pompous if I've ever heard it. \n\nSo I have to genuinely ask: why would any decent Christian want to believe in or worship a God that they believe does these things?",

I like the story in Acts of the Apostles where God/Jesus shows up and shows himself to Saul to make him convert, because supposedly God/Jesus knew that absolutely nothing else would convert Saul, but that simply revealing himself is \"all it would take.\"\n\n\nSo, why don't Christians question why God/Jesus never does that again? There are plenty of people, myself included, who embrace the world of religions, including or perhaps even especially Christinaity- Going to church and bible studies regularly to learn more, reading the Bible, praying, fasting, doing all sorts of things a Christian would be expected to do- and yet not feeling or experiencing anything in their life that gives them any reason to genuinely believe in a god.\n\nSo...

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/111lmat/are_there_any_pagan_and_christian_references_to/",
        "text": "First off, I don't think they did, but I'm asking based upon the text from this article... \n\n&gt;In  my The Death of the Messiah,  preparatory to examining the Gospel  accounts of the trial/interrogation  of Jesus by the chief priest(s) and  San-hedrin, I surveyed the  extra-Gospel evidence for authoritative  **Jewish involvement in the death  of Jesus, derived from Jewish,  Christian, and pagan sources**. From the  Jewish evidence I discussed two  items: the witness of Josephus (Ant. 18.3.3; #63–t) and a baraita from  TalBab Sanhedrin 43a which I quoted from the London Soncino translation  (Nezikin volume 3.281):  \nOn  the  eve of Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the  execution  took place, a herald went forth and cried, ‘He is going forth  to be  stoned because he has practised sorcery and enticed Israel to  apostacy.  Anyone who can say anything in his favour, let him come  forward and  plead on his behalf.’ But since nothing was brought forward  in his  favour he was hanged on the eve of Passover.\n\nThe boldening of words is by me. I've already looked at one story from the Talmud that may or may not record the killing of Jesus, but am having trouble finding any Christian or Pagan sources that support that claim. Does anyone know? I imagine, whatever sources they might be, I presume it's not directly saying it, but has been interpreted as saying it, like the excerpt above dealing with the death of someone named Yeshu. \n\nI have been able to find the reference the text above makes to the witness of Josephus. It reads...\n\n&gt; Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call  him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men  as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the  Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was \\[the\\] Christ. And when Pilate, at  the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to  the cross,  those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for  he appeared to them alive again the third day;  as the divine prophets  had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning  him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at  this day.  \n\nFrom what I've read from other sources, it sounds like Pilate just oversaw some of the proceedings that led to Jesus's crucifixion and didn't order it. Is the last sentence I wrote what is more generally believed? This link below also says Jewish leaders, along with Rome and others, conspired to have Jesus killed. \n\n[https://www.gotquestions.org/responsible-Christ-death.html](https://www.gotquestions.org/responsible-Christ-death.html)\n\nBut, in the end, the actual crucifixion was carried out by the Romans, correct? (That is also what the link above says) My next question would be, were those Roman soldiers Jewish? Or is that entirely impossible/unrealistic? I do not know what the relations between Romans and Judaism was at the time of Jesus's death.\n\nThank you to anyone who replies in-advance and I hope this post doesn't read too sloppily/badly written, and, again, I do not mean to incite anything hateful. I just would like everything clarified for me, basically.",

However, this is also considered a kind of Evangelicalism, even more important and relevant than preaching to people that are not believers in the first place who have no connection to our congregation.\n\nI wonder if Judaism and other religions that don't proselytize have a mechanism to reach non-practicing people in their own religion.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1115we2/should_hate_be_considered_its_own_religion/",
        "text": "This was a thought that I had recently after reading several comments in a recent thread about what religions we don't have respect for. Rather than identifying particular religions, many people commented something to the effect that generalizing any religion could be problematic as every religion is made up of both extremists and liberals, and that the real problem was with hate. This led me to wonder if hate itself might be a form of religion.\n\nFor this \"thought in progress\", I need to know exactly what is *religion*. Let's put aside the basic dictionary definitions and look to the sociology of religion, according to which two competing definitions emerge:\n\n1. [Emile Durkheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Durkheim) defined religion as \"a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them.\"\n2. [Max Lynn Stackhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Lynn_Stackhouse), defined religion as \"a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted\".\n\nEmile Durkheim's definition of religion seems useful here, so I'm going to break this definition down into some criteria. Religion must:\n\n1. possess a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things.\n2. unite people into a \"moral community\".\n\nI think we'd all accept that this community need not be called a \"church\" and could just as easily be referenced as a mosque, ummah, synagogue, temple, coven, etc. So we can dispense with this specifics of labels.\n\nDoes hate fulfil Durkheim's criteria?\n\nWhat we hold to be sacred outside the confines of religion varies from one society to the next, but perhaps one of the most sacred aspects of any society concerns how we define ourselves or how we define inclusion into our community, and I'd argue that this is usually a fairly fluid definition. If we look at the state of race relations in the United States, as simply one example, we see that prior to the 1950s and the emancipation of the African American community, to be \"American\" meant that you had to be White and Protestant. Catholics and non-Christians were tolerated, but \"not American\". Keep in mind that the first ships carrying slaves to the New World wasn't carrying Black slaves, it was carrying White Irish Catholic slaves. So the seeds of \"Us and Them\" was sewn early in American history. Catholics weren't really accepted into American society until the late 20th century (keeping in mind that the Ku Klux Klan, famous for its hatred of Blacks and Jews, was also vehemently anti-Catholic). Apartheid in America against Blacks didn't come to a formal end until the late 1960s, although we still palpably feel and see the effects of that apartheid era even today with disproportionate incarcerations, more gun shops located in predominantly Black neighborhoods, etc. Point being that American society has come to slowly, albeit it with considerable difficultly, come to be more diverse and accepting of different group. Nevertheless, there's still a great deal of suspicion of \"the other\". Having already mentioned systemic racism against Blacks, Catholics and Jews remain somewhat discriminated in American society with some bigots questioning their loyalty and whether Catholics can be loyal the United States and the Office of the POTUS or to Rome and the Pontiff. So we see in America (again, this is just an example and similar examples might be found the world over) a sacred sense of identity, and perhaps to a lesser extent, a set of sacred nationalist symbols in the flag, Pledge of Allegiance, the eagle, and chants of \"Freedom\", etc. I don't think these symbols are significant, for the purposes of this argument, because while we certainly do see these symbols being dragged out and paraded around by extremists (remember the \"Unite the Right\" rally), I'm more concerned here about the non-extremists who are still influenced by this cult of hate. Suffice to say that we have satisfied the first of Durkheim's criteria in having a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things.\n\nSo how do we unite these very different groups (White Protestants, White Catholics, and African Americans) who now find themselves living together with more or less equal rights? We pit them against a new enemy. Today, Sinophobia and violence against Asian Americans is becoming increasingly common in America and the perpetrators are span the spectrum of American society. Random attacks on Asian people, fueled by the political rhetoric of the previous presidency, as well as China's aggressive expansionism, which presents an existential threat to America's global hegemony and sense of exceptionalism, has somehow made it seem acceptable to stereotype all Asian people as \"Chinese\" (imagine if all White people were stereotyped as Nazis because most Germans in the 1940s were White). Pitted against a new enemy, the division between former enemies (i.e., White Protestants, White Catholics, and African Americans) begins to disappear, uniting these former foes. Another example of this can be found in the formation of the American \"Alt Right\" (which is a bit of a wishy-washy term that seems to mean different things to different people). Whereas the \"Far Right\" was made up almost entirely of White Protestants who hated Catholics, Blacks, Jews, Muslims, and Liberals, the \"Alt Right\" includes within its ranks many Protestants, Catholics, and Jews who hate Muslims and Liberals. My point here isn't to besmirch any community as we can see similar hate groups in every community. What I am trying to highlight here is that we often unite very different groups of people in their shared hatred of other groups or ideas. And where this unity between different groups is strongest is when they share a common set of \"sacred things\", or in this case, a share sacred identity, a nationalist identity: \"We're American, and you're not\".\n\nSo is hate a religion? While hate does seem to satisfy Durkheim's criteria, my \"thought in progress\" above has made me less sure that it does qualify as a religion. Perhaps the issue with my \"thought in progress\" is that I've chosen a rather bad example or one that is too easily emotionally over charged, because I come away from the \"thought in progress\" wondering if Nationalism isn't the real religion.",
