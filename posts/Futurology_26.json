        "text": "This question popped into my head while watching The Expense series, a series that the majority of you have likely either seen or heard about. In case anyone here hasn't, it's a show set a couple hundred years in the future. Navies have moved from seafaring powers to spacefaring ones. Earth is controlled by the UN, Mars is it's own power, and the asteroid belt is inhabited by numerous factions that share a similar culture/identity. \n\nI believe it to be obvious that we'll eventually exist within a certain reality, barring of course our self destruction, the second coming of Jesus for those who believe this, some sort of apocolypse, etc. No one can say for sure how long society will exist, but it only took us 70 years to advance from a horse and buggy to the rocket and Mars colonization may occur soon if Musk has his way of things.\n\nThis of course means that eventually seafaring vessels will become obsolete. Keeping in mind of course that all of this is speculative, what do you believe that naval powers will look like at the dawn of this reality? What systems specifically would result in this? Advanced jet engines that extend range and increase speed and effeciency? Lighter, cheaper rockets that have the range of ballistic missiles? Will military platforms have to be spacefaring? Will Earth have to be united before this reality occurs, or could nations simply duke it out on land and in space?\n\nAs a side note, the United States Air Force is currently working on their 6th generation fighter jet program, one of at least three programs that I'm aware of. The wish list the USAF has for this platfrom makes it sound less like a fighter though and more like a bloody spaceship. I can share more info if anyone is interested, but I believe that it points towards just how near to this reality we actually are.",

Search engines are a neutral collection of hyper links\n\nDo you see the difference?\n\nAI is basically a black box where you don't know how much bias it contains.\n\nSearch engines are a mere aggregator of links. They have no bias into them except SEO which does not influence the information just the order of presentation.\n\nBy trusting AI you are basically agreeing to the subjective opinions the authors embedded into it. By using search engines you are simply crowd-sourcing knowledge from all people.",

        "text": "I didn't see  flair for Entertainment :(\n\nHere's what I think will happen-\n\n1. Some famous actor will do a really high-end full body and face scan. Then they will license out their likeness. Think Angelina Jolie in that 2007 (I think) Beowulf cgi movie. For the time being she will have to still voice the project.\n\n2. Sooner rather than later, she will be able to read a specialized script to get all her voice inflections and modulations inputted into a system that will be able to generate her voice. I think they did this with Val Kilmer's lines in Top Gun: Maverick. \n\n3. Also, sooner rather than later, other aging celebs will jump on the Scan and License train. I accidentally watched one of those new Bruce Willis movies, the dude barely moved or talked. It was really sad.\n\n4. At some point, there will be a system that allows AI to construct sets. Think of the Unreal Engine and all of it's assets. So, a script can call for a [Mid-20th century American living room], and the AI would build this in UE (or whatever), and then the Set Designer and Director would go in and tweak it to their liking.\n\n5. In a decade or 2 we could be seeing movies with the Scans of 'aged out' stars on virtual sets, with 'lesser' actors acting with stand-ins/tennis balls on sticks on green screen sets. Think Sky Captain, and the World of Tomorrow. (I guess there are loads of shows that do this now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).\n\n6. Eventually, these 'lesser' actors will 'scan in' as extras and side characters. Probably with their faces and voices changed. Something akin to what they do with Mo-cap now.\n\n7. As virtual character generation gets better (in the next decades) the 'lesser' actors won't be needed.\n\n8. As time goes on, there will be totally AI generated/CGI stars (look at the obsession some people already have with anime characters).\n\n9. The call for 'Scanned Stars' will die out, due to- people caring less and less about the 'Angelina Jolie's' and 'Bruce Willis'' of the world; and (of course) the studios would love to not pay the fees for Stars. So, they'll push for 'S1m0ne' to be the next big thing.\n\n10. Eventually, all major studio releases will be AI/CGI, and an industry of 'Organic' independent movies will grow.\n\n11. I think there will be some way to select a movie to watch, and then select from a menu: which 'actors' you want, and which style you'd like to watch it in (Anime, photo realistic, etc...)\n\n12. You may even be able to tweak the story and other elements of a movie: Rating, various 'Triggers', more Comedy than Romance/more Romance than Comedy, etc...\n\n13. If (when) all this happens, FanFic and Self Published scripts will be able to be fed into the app and generated.",
