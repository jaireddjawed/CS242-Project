Please don’t be rude I’m just trying to learn. \n\n\nSo if someone has a basal metabolic rate (which if I understand is the calories they’d burn if they sat still all day doing LITERALLY NOTHING) is 2200. Then they burn an extra 400 with no exercise but walking around then they need to eat 2600 calories to maintain weight that day. \nAnd if they ate 750 less, then over the course of 7 days they’d lose 1.5 pounds because 750*7=5250 lost calories. The inverse is also true if you are 750 extra a day right?\n\n\nWith that out of the way… do all those lost calories actually burn weight/ extra calories go into fat? \nHow does this relate to muscle growth? Since the example is not exercising other than light walking any extra calories would be turned into fat not muscle correct? I’m just trying to make sure I get this correct before I start learning other things about nutrition. Start with basics basically",

What is the best sweetener I can use that isn't full of chemicals and ideally doesn't have dextrose if that's the case.",

What are good foods I can have on lunch that I can have cold, are satiating, filling and delicious? And also, that don’t take a lot of time to consume?\n\nThanks.",

I think it's clear that (especially in bodybuilding/fitness) protein is suplemented in an high amount that would be difficult to eat everyday. How harmful is it consuming that much proteins? If I do it for some years, does is raise the risk of something? I just can't immagine that eating (actually drinking) that much protein is good for your body, but I'm no expert.",

From what I read online 35% of macros should ideally come from protein, but other websites then suggest 2g/kg bodyweight.\n\nThis differs a lot though. On a 2500 calorie diet, 35% of calories from protein would be 875 calories and therefore 218g of protein (875/4 calories per gram).\n\nTaking the 2g/kg bodyweight approach, at 65kg I would need to eat only 130g. \n\nWhich is now correct, can anyone offer some guidance?",

But why?\n\nI am aware that of course the amount of protein that has to be eaten rises by reducing the amount of fats, this is just a question as to why it is **necessary/essential** to eat fats.\n\nThank you for your answers and have a nice day.",
