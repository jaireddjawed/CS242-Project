Got hired as a junior dev right out of college (BS in comp sci) and have been working there ever since.\n\nSimply put, I don’t think industry coding is for me. I do genuinely enjoy programming on my own time, but over the years Ive discovered that I do not like it within the confines of the industry and wanted to start exploring/researching different career paths.\n\nI’d still like to remain in tech and potentially do a bit of programming, I just don’t think a full on software engineering role is the right way forward for me. I’m not looking to transition right at this moment, but I do want to start researching options for the future.\n\nHas anyone here been in the same boat that can share some of your experiences or advice? Let me know if there’s anything I can expand on to help paint a better picture.",

That combined with untreated ADHD made me a very bad student...  \n\n\nEverything's getting better this year though fortunately, I got diagnosed and started meds, read Atomic Habits 3 times. I'm finally doing better at uni. But unluckily for me the only subject that could made me sit and enjoy and actually eager to learn is Programming.   \nIt's a basic Programming 1 subject which teaches fundamentals Java and Python (from variables to classes, objects, inheritance). Man I love it... But Finance still gives me yawning episodes but it's a bit better than before. \n\nI've also started TOP foundation (front-end stuff) and absolutely love it. YES. Finally something I like to do and find really interesting.\n\nSo long story short, I changed my study planner from doing Acct + Finance to Finance + Electives.  \nI get to study 7 Electives! My Finance major is only 8 subjects, so I basically have the chance to study a major-minor in CS! Although without the official name... :( \n\nSo I'm trying to pick the diamonds, the absolute chads in a CS degree to study, here's my list after researching online:  \n\n\nProgramming 1  \nProgramming 2  \nDatabase Fundamentals  \nData Structure and Algorithms  \nAdvanced Algorithms  \nDiscrete Maths  \nLast one - undecided.\n\nI can choose to study basically anything (from OS to CS theory to Web Dev to Data Systems...)\n\nPeople seem to prefer OS to CS theory here? So I kinda don't know what to do... This is where I need your help, please help... \n\nI'm also aware of [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) and it is definitely on my list for the future, the guide said itself that if you're not a competent programmer as of this moment, go become one then come back to the guide in a year or two... So I'm planning to do that!  \n\n\nAppreciate any responses, thank you!",

        "text": "Two years ago, I started freelancing as a fullstack engineer after burning out from working for a startup for two years which, in hindsight, took advantage of me. After realizing the value of the work I'm doing I left and started freelancing, which went really well (I made about 10-15k a month, which is a lot for an EU freelancer). For one of my clients, a young startup, I was developing a complex B2B platform. Business went really well for that startup, and it became my main client, making up most of my monthly income (which of course you should avoid as a freelancer).  8 months in, the approached me with an offer: They wanted me as the CTO of their company (that's now 7 months ago). I really didn't want to work for a failing startup again and avoid repeating the same mistakes, so I clearly stated my demands, which aimed at minimizing the risk of the company failing and me still making a decent salary along the way. The demand was €10,000 salary a month + 10 percent of the company, take it or leave it. As I was already making a lot as a freelancer, and my actual plan back then was to scale my freelance business and hire additional staff, I thought that's a fair deal. I have 7 YoE and am really passionate about my work, don't mind doing over hours, have experience managing teams, and don't mind hopping on a call with a customer at 10PM to fix a problem. I did know that I probably would have to put in a lot more work than previously, work on weekends, and have practically no holidays, but that's all acceptable looking at the possibility of a potential and not so unrealistic exit.\n\nThey accepted my offer, we were all happy, celebrated, and started working. From that moment on, I was actually publicly presented as a co-founder everywhere, which is strongly needed when searching for investors (a software startup without a co-founding CTO is not well received as you can imagine).\n\nIt was indeed one of the most stressful and challenging times in my life, I am the sole developer building a whole platform used by 120+ enterprise clients, and the number is growing. I didn't take a single day off since then and fully free weekends are rare.\n\nThe business is going well, and our CEO is working nearly full time on raising money (until now we bootstrapped).\n\nToday, our CEO calls me, and says our cashflow doesn't look that well, but it's manageable. Thing is, he said to me, it is very difficult for him to justify my high payroll to investors, as I am earning as much as all the other 3 co-founders combined (who hold the rest of the company shares). He argued that investors don't like to see the unequal pay distribution and that it could become a problem, if not \\*the deciding factor\\*, for receiving investment.\n\nI said to him, I honestly don't know what to respond now, our initial conditions were quite clear and reducing my salary because of investor relations... I don't know, just seems wrong, as I really put so so much effort in this, and after all it's a software company... and I am the only person developing and maintaining the software, and I didn't join as a \"traditional\" co-founder right from the start.\n\nNow I wanted to ask you folks: Am I the asshole here? Do I demand too much? Should I steer in and offer to reduce my salary?\n\n**Note**: From the 10k I make monthly, I directly pay 2k to one of the co-founders, because I bought the 10% from him and I essentially \"pay them off\" this way. So, after taxes, all in all, it's about 4-5k.\n\nThis situation really puts a lot of pressure on me currently as I really like the company, the people, the co-founders and the overall product vision. But this makes me really anxious now, and I don't know what to do, as I don't want to be the person who ruins it for everyone.\n\nI'm probably too emotional on this to see things objectively, it feels like I can't see the forest for the trees anymore.\n\nThanks for reading all this, I know it's quite a complex situation and probably not so common.Hope you all are having a great day!",

So:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **What's the day-to-day like?** What's the work-life balance? How difficult is the job itself (I know there are different jobs, but generally either backend or frontend, at least your experiences)? Honestly I'm kinda worried it's too much for me.\n2. **How stressful is it / can it be?** This is huge for me. I'm very worried that this field would be too fast-paced and too much would be expected of me and I'd have to constantly keep up. Right now in life I just want something that pays ok, will get my life actually moving (NEET and stuck for a while now) and won't make me wanna Roblox myself.\n3. **What's actually most important to getting hired**, at least as a junior? How hard is it to actually get a job?\n4. **How much math is there?** I'm not horrible, but I'd rather not.\n5. **Is Python necessary?**\n6. **Is part-time work viable** or will I be dismissed offhand if I want that? Financially I'm fine RN.\n7. **What's the general vibe, in your experience?** This sorta ties back to 2. I'm just scared of getting myself stuck in a big impersonal corporate constantly online machine, tech screams that to me. Obviously it varies from place to place, but I'm guessing there's a general baseline. I know it's a general question.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "Hello and thanks in advance for reading my post and offering any advisement/guidance.\n\nI have been an IT kinda guy since I discovered Linux in the mid 2000s. I never pursued anything tech related though and did my undergraduate in a non CS field. Then in the mid 2010's I really got interested in coding and started learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. I build a few applications and by 2018 I was confident enough in my abilities and what I had under my belt to apply for a masters program in the UK, which accepted me thanks to showing my strong self taught CS background and a letter of recommendation from someone that worked with me and the institution I studied at. I completed the course in 2021, and have been trying to break into development on my own, remotely, for over a year. \n\nMy situation is a bit unique. I am an American living abroad (have lived abroad for over a decade) and would like to do development work for EU/NA clients. I've registered and signed up for upwork and have been making bids on projects for over a year with no responses. I've also been continuing to develop my skillset, and have been learning Rust (more because at this point I want to learn something that I want to learn, a whole degree in everything from mobile development, project management, fullstack development, etc, while exciting and educational, hasn't always been what I would choose to learn), and have started working on some applications of my own in Rust, and I'm contemplating beginning to contribute to a couple projects on github. \n\n**My Goal:**\n\nShort term, I just want to find a part time/freelance work in NA or EU working with technology I know and am confident using, such as PHP+MySQL (regardless of framework. I've tried Laravel and feel pretty comfortable I could get up to speed with it quick. for example). But I am not currently working in development or technology. I'm working in Education and am making a comfortable living with this and would like to do free lance/part time until I have a stronger CV/Resume and portfolio to actually transition to development as a fulltime job. Quitting my job for the next year+ is NOT an option for me now and I really want to gain real world experience\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Problem:**\n\nHow do I break into development? I have knowledge, background, and have built some applications for a former employer (server side tools), but I would probably still come in as an entry level programmer based on my lack of developer experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Github: [https://github.com/RPG-Alex](https://github.com/RPG-Alex) \n\nThanks again for reading my post and please have a nice week",

I hope I can bring up this transition in an interview setting. \n\nMy thought process is something as follows:\n\n“Tell me about yourself”\n\n“I graduated from college with a degree in electrical engineering after which I start a career as an electrical design engineer, mainly focusing on the design and construction of electrical power systems. Although I enjoyed the work, I quickly realized there were a number of day-to-day tasks that could be automated with programming. So I began building custom Python scripts to help automate a few of my tasks, and eventually began building a full suite of internal company software tools that helped increase productivity of the design engineering department I was working on. Eventually my role transitioned from electrical engineer to software engineer in our internal software development department, where I mainly focused on building full stack web applications to increase productivity and automate tasks to help with engineering productivity…. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with ky current team but feel my career may be better served by working for a product-focused technology company, which is the reason I’ve applied to this role an hope to work with your company in the near future.” \n\nSomething along those lines. Would my previous experience as an electrical engineer make hiring managers shy away from hiring me? Should I mention it at all?",

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm a university student majoring in computer science at a smallish university, in my fourth year of study. I've got one more year of study to go, doing a 4 year degree in five years to give myself a little more room to breathe. I've got a healthy academic transcript so far, like a 4.2 GPA right now, though I note that I'm Canadian and I'm not sure if the system changes at all, but I've got an A- or better in all of my courses, with an A+ in more than half of them.\n\nHowever, I've been absolutely sucker punched by a course, analysis of algorithms (distinct from analysis and design of algorithms, which i did very well in), taught by a prof that is absolutely taking me apart. I'm definitely not going to take another class with this prof going forwards, but in the interim I'm faced with a tricky choice. I figure I could probably get like a B- in the course if I try to finish it out, which saves me from needing to take another math course for my math minor but leaves me with a bad mark, or I could withdraw from the course to avoid a bad mark on my transcript but doing so would require me to take another class.\n\nI suppose all of this boils down to asking: how much will a poor grade (C+/B- I'm guessing) on an otherwise sound transcript affect my future prospects?",
