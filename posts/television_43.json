        "text": "Since, Fox has continuously renewed their only three long-running cartoon series The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bobs Burgers for another two seasons , I am going to talk about why all three animated adult shows have been renewed for more seasons.\n\nThe reason  The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bobs Burgers  have continuously been renewed for more seasons is because they are Fox's and now Disney's cash cow as their shows are considered popular and seeing that they continuously renewed the show for many seasons , maybe the FOX executives could have confessed in a joke (or serious as the three shows are their cash cow) that all three shows will get  their  \"eternal renewal\" status and will never ever be cancelled.\n\nBut there is another reason why the 3 shows keep getting continuously renewed for more seasons, recent animated shows that aired for FOX get mediocre reception and didn't capture the magic that made the Simpsons, Family Guy and Bobs Burgers  popular and is the reason the 3 shows receive their   \"eternal renewal\"status and became long-running ever since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there are some risks for the three shows when they keep renewing  for more seasons and will never get cancelled\n\n* Quality decline-when all 3 shows are renewed for more seasons , their quality begins to decline, they might sometime improve or decline which means they will no longer have their quality which bought them to popularity many years ago that would alienate some of their oldest fans because they are no longer the show they watched many years ago.\n* Deceased cast members - Another problem with long-running shows is that cast members who voiced their characters will pass away, especially those who quit, such as Phil Hartman who voiced the recurring casts of the Simpsons like Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure was murdered that his characters were erased from the show, Marcia Wallace who voiced  Edna Krabappel passed away causing her character to be killed off from the show which reflects what tvtrope describes *\"The Character Died with Him\"* and the recent controversy that revolves around Apu due to the Problem with Apu documentary caused the character to be removed from the show even though the voice actor Hank Azaria (who voiced most of the recurring characters of the Simpsons) is alive. The only solution to end this risk is that executive will take the risky move by recasting the characters with new voice actors, if they would continuously renew the three shows  for many seasons. \n* Some of their oldest fans will move on- When the fans find out the show's quality decline, they will move on from the show, but all three shows will still get more fans and will keep them ongoing for more seasons.\n\nEven if the quality of the  3 shows  will decline if it keeps on getting renewed for more seasons , Fox will never cancel them as they will be their cash cow that will never be cancelled especially that recent adult animated shows that air on FOX are mediocre and forgotten.\n\nIt will take some future daring CEO of FOX to take the risky move by ending the endless  renewal  of The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bobs Burgers and no longer consider them cash cows as they want the company to move on to other things instead of continuously renewing all 3 animated shows for more seasons.\n\nThat way, it will be considered a historic year  that all 3 animated shows will get a real, proper sendoff and say goodbye to their fans after a long run.\n\nBut for now, FOX and even Disney will repeatedly renew the Simpsons, Family Guy and Bobs Burgers for many more seasons with their \"eternal renewal\" status that will prevent them from cancellation.",

        "text": "(Spoilers ahead of obviously)\n\nI was recently watching a show that had a villain that clearly should have ended in the first season. That got me thinking about how well Angel was able to utilize Wolfram &amp; Hart throughout the series. There wasn't ever a point for me during the show where I felt cheated by the fact they weren't able to be defeated.\n\nI think the fact that it was a larger entity made up of different characters certainly helped quite a bit. Lindsey, Lilah, Gavin &amp; others while all working towards the same ultimate goal didn't feel interchangeable. They had their own dynamic with Angel.. Then when one of the lawyers got killed off it left they were replaced by an identical character. \n\nAlso them receding into the background during certain portions of the run helped as well. Their were significant portions of the show when they weren't the focus. So when moved to the forefront again it was still interesting \n\nI could be blanking on some obvious examples of shows that did it better. Nothing is coming to mind though.",

I feel the nurse really crushed her role. The cgi looks like something I could make. There was a cool scene in a bathroom involving a mirror. Really not much to say. I'm pretty sure the entire budget and attraction of the show is Sarah Michelle Gellar who gets very little screen time and who's character could have been played by anyone. Any one finding redeeming qualities they'd be willing to share so I can convince myself it's good.",

Looking back it was really odd for a sitcom to change up its cast and settings so much. Sitcoms are usually built around a formula but the amount of cast switches and settings changes in Sabrina it was clear they didn't really care about a strict formula. Which is surprising considering how much of a hit it was for ABC. Like I remember a lot of the high school characters as being in it a lot but apparently most of them where only in it for two or three of the seven seasons. Thinking about from season 1 to the end of the show when she's working at the magazine it seems like two completely different shows. Apparently the who magazine storyline and characters were also dropped halfway through the last season. Just another shake up that I find amazing for a sitcom to risk.",
