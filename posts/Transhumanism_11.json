Maybe everyone will become atheists? \n\nI was raised in a Catholic family but just kind of believe in not being an asshole as of now.

        "text": "I think that, at the root, this is just based on personal philosophies.\n\nLet's just define mind uploading as: somehow uploading all the information in your brain to a computer that can accurately emulate a human brain, thus making a non-biological replica of you (this point in itself can get complicated, ex. how do we deal with sensory deprivation?, but that's an entirely different story). \n\nOne point brought up is how we can't scan the brain without destroying it in the process, but let's imagine that we can. If that's the case, there are now two completely individual minds: the one on the computer, and the original biological mind which the computer mind is a copy of. \n\nThe original mind cannot experience whatever the computer mind is feeling, and the computer mind cannot experience what the original mind is feeling. It's as simple as that. The original mind will eventually die because it is biological, and the computer mind will (theoretically) be immortal. \n\nSome people argue that since the original mind eventually dies, mind uploading should not count as immortality. \n\nOther people argue that the fact that there exists another identical copy of the original mind means that, in essence, the original mind never dies. \n\nHopefully you can see that this goes deep into personal philosophies, and there isn't necessarily a correct answer.\n\nThat's what I think, I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on the topic.",

Experts say that the first possible thing that can be done is to transfer personal memories into virtual space. This has two ways of doing. One is what is known as \"transhumanism\" or mind uploading wherein the memories stored in a human's mind are copied and stored as a computer code. The other is uploading of human's life experiences using recording on devices which are capable of producing a virtual copy. \n\nThis transition is believed to be able to lead humans into becoming a virtual form of that individual which then leads to the possibility of not having to experience death. Why not? I'm only 30 and I still have a lot of plans in my life. If I can have more time in the virtual world to do all of those plans, I'll go for it.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/djy0lpodapa11.jpg",

I'd simply go to sleep, with the possibility of waking in the future when treatment is 1) more likely to succeed, and 2) less harmful to the body or even 3) when brains are simply uploaded to the immortal machine.\n\nBut, by this field of logic, I should just freeze right now, as natural death is hanging over my head, and why freeze a body that might be 60 or 70, and with cancer, instead of freezing this good body, with no known health problems, right now, to re-invigorate in the future.  \n\nThe thought of course is... LARP.  If I was serious, if I seriously believed, (like Christians claim to believe in a heaven), I would freeze myself right now.

I mean, at that point, (70 Billion), we would be eating ourselves and our poop-to-meat-miracle-Japanese machines.   But shit like, say, Kurus disease, will have found a cure way before then. It's a guess.  I'll admit.  There are many risks with humankind.  I know a lot will argue it can only handle a billion more.  If you want to talk seriously, at least admit the Earth can handle 40 Billiion.  But I know it can handle more than 39 Billion, if you understand what I mean.\n\nI just mean biologically, that is, if we farmed every square meter for food.\n\nGenetically, we are screwed.  Because human fights, (like only a handful  of other alpha battles), can be fatal.  However, industrial scale slaughter, is STRICTLY a human (and insect) trait\\*.   Its the law of power; Power flows upwards, and smashes downwards.  If dinosaurs ruled the world, they would be the most \"fratricidal\" group on the planet.  So war is part of the meta-code, call it maybe the lemming anomaly.\n\nTo follow anomolies, to understand them, is to understand there is so much more between black and white, positive negative, male/female.\n\nBut please, lets be real, In 40 years, the planet is expected to have 10 Billion people.\n\nWith the best of human technology, even with dams providing energy to power lights, in 300 years, humankind would come to a point, where the planet's total energy, even its... ..\"metabolic energy\"\\*... is exhausted.\n\nOf course, it seems to me DNA has a strand, in which life and death itself has a say.\n\nEverything must live and die.  This is not survival of the fittest species... ...it is survival of the fittest... ...I'll call it Gaia.\n\nWe can avoid that future, of course, by following our spirits, which reach for the stars.  We all feel it when observing the galaxy in a black night... that deep awe of eternity, and our place in it.\n\nWe must begin colonizing and reaching out roads.\n\nBut who will take the first step?  The two equal and brave steps for peoplekind, people of color, LGBTQ, otherkin, and all the other oppressed minorities who can excuse my microaggression for not counting them in my writing.\n\nI me'n' mankind.  Because only men would volunteer to go to Mars, for real.  OUTRIGHT LIE, but somewhat true.\n\n(Women can go to Venuth.  Oh My Goth, we are thooo ditherent!)\n\nI see an apparent fractal pattern in all life forms (except otherkin, because they are phony and insane).  I will call it \"Gaia\".\n\nIt seems for most lifeforms, the more resources, the merrier.  Food and fucks for all.   Everybody has plenty of fucks to give about each other.  But for humans, the offspring start to be reduced.   The wealthier the family, the less offspring they produce.  It is certainly NOT a new topic amongst  the wealthy, they always pondered, and worried, about the concrete social fact, across ALL human cultures\\*: poor people reproduce faster.   That is a fact, no matter where you are at.\\*\\*\n\nWar.  It is inevitable that War is the end conclusion of any species, , in the cruel world of survival of the fittest.  The closer the species gets to dominator status, the closer nature itself, I will call it Gaia, comes in, and stops it.  The more powerful the species gets, so too, do the better the males get at reproductive intra-competition.\n\nTo a point, of course.  As they get better, healthier, etc, so too do they become better at their own intra-species conflict, therefore becoming deadlier.  Animal instinct mixed with all the caution and meekness of wanting to fuck a female in heat.\n\nIt is clear, war is part of \"toxic-masculinity\".\n\nProblem with war, is it is so deeply ingrained in our genes, that any attempts at cultural or societal control of it, will backfire, and bring war even sooner.  No lifeform cheats death.  OVERALL, NO species cheats death.  It can evolve to fight off all challenges of existence, but death itself...  this applies to all living beings.\\*\\*\\*  War is Gaia's balance to intellectual and complete control of a planet's surface.  .   Humankind, even as the clear dominator species of the planet, does not get to sidestep this rule.  Because human minds and tools set them apart from animals, so too then, does their particular style of alpha dominance specialize in thinking and tools of mass death.\n\nCool the sword, and let the hate fill.  It's just flint on steel.\n\nIf you lived in a mans world, telling me \"men are violent and unstable\", would not be an understatement.  I know... because, as a male, I am 90&amp;#37; times more likely to be the recipient of violent assault.  Like when a friend toid me, \"you think YOU are scared of black people.. it's like they always want to beat my ass first, because I'm black\".  Yeah, dudettes, world is really rough.  Life Is not fair.  You might get a wolf whistle or your ass pinched, I might get my jaw broken.\n\nThing is, when you think you can tell me the solution to war, hatred, and male aggression and violence.. ...I just laugh, at your poor, sheltered, female life.  And if you are a man... Get real, your alpha senses are tingling, right now.  That hatred, that anger.  When human males hate, it is war, when female humans hate, it is social tugging.  How exactly does the Indian caste system sustain itself?  Please tell me, because I guarantee it is not patriarchy.  Nor is India particularly the shangri-La of peace, Ghandi or otherwise.\n\n\\*(There are always anomolies, part of chaos, that is essential to the life/death struggle... ..because all creation comes from destruction).\n\n\\*\\*Except areas ruled by Harems or Mormons.\n\n\\*\\*\\*The further up the chain, the more anomolies occur; what you get when you examine the concept of extropic chaos.",

They’re sexist, nationalistic, hypocritical, boring and old-fashioned – at least for the most past. Everyone knows that virtually all athletes are guilty of doping, while those that don’t use any banned performance enhancing drugs go as close to the edge as legally possible and are still on a ton of different shit. \n\nI say: Fuck it. Let’s end this bullshit and have the mutants battle it out! You wanna take steroids, hormones, EPO or whatever else there is? Or snort some Crystal Meth before stepping out on the court? I say, go for it! Instead of legs you wanna use those bouncy spring things that the South-African dude who shot his girlfriend through the bathroom door had instead of calf muscles? Or throw some wheels on there? I say, as long as folks wanna see it, knock yourself out! Let’s see how high we can *really* jump, provided we have the dopest exoskeletons available. Let’s put sports with flying just for shits and giggles in there and see what kind of rocket man shit Elon Musk comes up with. Hell, I’d watch that! \n\nAnd that’s not even mentioning the fights…\n\nSeriously though, the world needs a new Collosseum! And if we’re gonna go full-on decadent civilization, we might as well go hard. Think of it as the UFC of Human/Hybrid robots. The greatest show on planet earth! Who wouldn’t wanna watch *that*?\n\nThe benefits for all of humanity are also quite significant: if the Transhumanist Games were to get as big as the Olympics or even bigger in terms of ratings and popularity, the amount of money that would go into research and development for technology that will ultimately benefit us all by achieving new breakthroughs in science, agility and longevity would be mind-boggling. It might even kickstart a boom in new inventions, all the while slowly eating away at our stupid tendency to to evolve veeeeryyyy slooooowlyyyy. \n\nLet’s accelerate this bitch, huh?\n\nI’m currently assembling a bunch of ideas for the Transhumanist Games as well as figuring out a way how to kickstart the organization. I will probably end up setting up a Patreon account or a GoFundMe and try to bring this thing to life, because I really, really want to watch this on TV! \n\nWe need something positive, crazy, futuristic and highly entertaining right now to take the edge off of all this negativity we had in the past years. Let’s work together and make this happen!\n\nYall on board?\n\nPeace!",

I quoted forever because eventually entropy is gonna catch up with transhumanists. But why extend your life for so long? Centuries or Thousands of years. That would probably bring more harmful consequences than benefits. You'd feel dettached from your environment since the culture you grew up in has changed radically, other people might not live as long, and you could eventually get tired of living. What happens to memory after 1000 years; Will you run out of space (with or without enhancements)?\n   \nWhat if you get to live for hundreds of thousands of years? You'd probably notice evolutionary changes of the species around you (could include humans, assuming not all people are transhumanized).\n   \nThis isn't a post against transhumanism at all; if anything, it was to ask why you guys pursue immortality? As I wrote this, I realized that such a life extension might not be so ugly and overwhelming; if you can maintain your mental health through the ages, and free your memory from unwanted/unnecessary memories, then most of immortality's issues and limitations would be eliminated.",

        "text": "Tl;dr: I'm doing some oil paintings in a series on transhumanism and I'd to share/pick your brains.\n\nHey everyone, I'm an artist and have been mostly lurking in here for a few years now. Several years ago I decided I need to go back to making art that means something deeper (to me mostly), I've been doing a lot of pet portraits and cityscapes and things that aren't hitting a nerve for my brain, but are fine subjects. My friend encouraged me to paint an image, which at the time I couldn't understand why I wanted to paint. Over time, the idea has evolved and I realized I have been hiding my feelings about being disabled away from the world and that is why I have an obsessive fascination with cyborgs. As a result, transhumanism has become more important to me.\n\nI'm looking to do a series of maybe 10-12 paintings, something I can fill a gallery with, and put on a solo exhibit whether a gallery supports me or not (the \"or not\" means I'll use crowdfunding to raise the budget like a proper business woman). It's a big dream of mine...in fact, I'm really afraid of it failing and how this might kill my sense of self, because I've literally gone all in and I make a humble living off of being creative. I don't know if I'll be able to paint anymore if I don't finish these paintings. That's okay, I am very excited!\n\n\nI'd like to thank this subreddit for being a streamlined research point for me. The recent posts about amputees with bionics really speak to me. They are everything I've been excited about. One day, a bionic leg or arm won't be any different than how we wear glasses today, even very fashionable. \n\n\n[Here is the first painting I did.](https://artkarolina.com/gallery/#!gallery/ML/947) Like I said, I didn't really know *why* I was painting this at the time, but I've had time to think about it. I have a prosthetic hip, which isn't as extreme as having a bionic arm. However, it's literally given me my life back. I've gone from being in a wheel chair to being able to walk 10km in a day, and I'm in the best shape I've ever been in. I feel very 'powerful', after so much struggling to just get from point A to B before (I wasn't always in a wheel chair or with a cane, but I degraded to such an extent.) It lead me to think about other disabilities and the long&amp;short of it - transhumanism. For me, the image shows that transcendence of limitation as well as the work that takes (the fatigue), and the satisfaction (taking a moment to reflect at sunset). This woman has to carry the weight of these heavy, metal limbs, but the soreness from that is nothing compared to not having the option. I don't know if that's what you see, but that's what I see. Of course, I like adding an element of sexiness too.\n\n\n[I have another painting I finished recently.](https://artkarolina.com/artkarolina/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/006-JUNE-2018-Currently-Untitled-36x24-sml.jpg) I very intentionally composed it like some [Renaissance](http://www.initaly.com/regions/veneto/pix/bellini/pieta.jpg) and [Barque](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d1/6b/66/d16b66cdf0673e37444117221885a9da.jpg) paintings with the posing and composition, but added an element of [American Western art lighting](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/7c/4b/5d7c4b9d30fc058b1cf9060c77a43a80.jpg) for emotion and atmosphere. The cyborg woman is a symbol for technology, advancement, and conquering death. The angel man is kind of a reference to Jesus and a lose of life. Together, it's a dynamic of new vs. old, our new, inorganic, unnatural technologies giving us life over natural death, biological nature, and religion. The other layer is gender, because women are generally less strong than men, and definitely not typically strong enough to pick up an adult man. The scrap yard and cars are a symbol of our use of natural resources (elements and metals), meanwhile also a symbol of disability and destruction - I'm going to keep using a scrap car as a symbol for a loss of physical mobility in future paintings. I'm kind of struggling to title this painting because I'd like something biblical or  Roman/Greek to hint at my thought process. I'm not good with names, so if any history or mythology buff can help, I'd greatly appreciate suggestions.\n\nSome other images I'm contemplating:\n\n* Portraits of people with bionic limbs already, almost like \"the future is here already\" and because they're pretty awesome as is.\n\n* Images relating to surgery (surgical tools, a surgical theatre, medical apparatuses and hospital scenes) - why? It's the darker side of this process...medicine running your life and the hospital being a second home, the pain.\n\n* Other kinds of prosthetics and medical technologies - a deaf boy listening to birds, and someone seeing the ocean for the first time with their new eyes\n\n* Images on the loss of mobility (eg. a person in a wheel chair + a scrap car, I'm not done this thought yet obviously). I could go on &amp; on about the stigma of being disabled, but for this one it'd be about becoming \"useless\".\n\nI know the relationship between immortality &amp; death comes up in here often, but I have no visual ideas on how to portray that yet...\n\nOtherwise, I'm very open to suggestions either in this thread or any time a thought sparks you in the future. I'm hoping I can make more than 10-12 cool cyborg paintings, something more thoughtful. If not, I hope at least you enjoy the paintings I have so far and thanks for reading.\n",

        "text": "Today the topic of assisted dying came came up and I realised I hadn't revisited my views on this since my (relatively) recent active interest in transhumanism.\n\nPreviously my initial reaction was \"yes of course, people should have the right to choose\" but these days it's more about how we should try and keep people alive for as long as possible just in case we might be able to extend them further (or live forever?).\n\nThis to me lead to further questions, in a time when the human experience is not limited to our biological bodies what does it even mean to be dead? Should we be allowed to end our existence if we choose? What if there are multiple copies (or backups) of you, should we be allowed to \"revive\" that person if they have chosen to be dead?\n\nAlso an interesting thought, is the desire to be dead a flaw or disease that we should try to heal/edit out of ourselves? What if we try and find that we can't?",
