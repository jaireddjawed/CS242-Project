Below are some relevant items I'd ask for you to include:\n\n* Location\n* Number of times you go to the store each week/month\n* Average cost of a grocery store trip\n* Goal amount you aim to spend each week on groceries\n* If you spend money on takeout, what that averages out to on a weekly basis\n* What you are most commonly buying / pantry staples\n* Any relevant anecdotes or tips you can share\n\n\nHoping this helps other people find inspiration and gain perspective heading into the new year.

        "text": "We bought our old farmhouse knowing we'd redo the kitchen and laundry room within a few years. The laundry room is obviously a cheap makeover of a back porch but it's functional. However last year we were very frustrated trying to keep the laundry room from sucking all the heat from the rest of the house. The windows, walls and floor are poorly insulated and the cellar (trap) door is drafty too. We do laundry frequently, and we got a BetterVent to keep the heat from the electric dryer inside which seemed to work okay. My husband reinsulated the cellar ceiling as well. But whenever we weren't drying a load of laundry, it was a problem. We closed off the kitchen as best we could to reduce the loss. \n\nThis year, we hung heavier curtains on the windows, but the main difference is an insulated curtain that I made from some inexpensive flannel and an emergency blanket (aka mylar blanket). I hung this curtain on the inside of the laundry room, and it works pretty well. **Today the temperature difference between the two rooms is 20¬∞F.**\n\nOutside it's a balmy 32¬∞. In the laundry room it is 42¬∞. In the kitchen, it is 61¬∞ (our winter temp) and the furnace is not running continuously. \n\nI'm not very good at sewing, but this is what I made. Imagine a door-size pillowcase hanging upside=down over a door opening. Instead of a pillow, there is an emergency blanket (aka large mylar sheet) that is attached to the inside with velcro. I chose this structure because I wanted to be able to remove the mylar to wash the curtain, and I needed to encase the mylar in fabric so it would hang properly and not move with the air currents. The flannel also reduces the \"crinkling\" noise that mylar makes when moved.\n\nEmergency blankets cost around $1 each. On sale, flannel costs $3-4/yd; on clearance, it will be even less. However Goodwill sells sheets and blankets that may be less expensive over all. \n\nNote: Utility fabrics that block heat (or keep it inside) are readily available at fabric stores. However these can cost $5 to $36/yd. Emergency blankets are inexpensive and effective, but they are noisy, \"floaty\" and can tear away from fasteners. Encasing them in flannel helped reduce those drawbacks.",

It's important to note that you have to click on the provided daily links, do the Bing searches in your computer, and do them on your phone to maximize your return. The way I cheese the daily bing searches is I search for \"avengers endgame cast\" and I use my middle mouse button to click on every actors picture at the top of the screen and each time I click on a different actor's picture, that counts as a search.\n\n  \n\n\nIt may sound like a bit of tedium to go through to save a measly $10 a month but overtime it adds up. I also use another Microsoft account that I have to pay for my Xbox PC game pass which is only 7500 points for a one-month subscription so your points go further.\n\n  \n\n\nI have been doing this for a little over a year now and have saved myself about $250 sitting down and taking less than 5 minutes every morning just clicking on stuff.",

        "title": "How I Save My Family $400 a Year With Dr Bronners Liquid Castile Soap",
        "author": "crazycake77",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/zxe8g1/how_i_save_my_family_400_a_year_with_dr_bronners/",
        "text": "Ok guys check this out. Last year I started getting really sensitive to store bought health and beauty products, especially lotion, soap and shampoo. I had a heck of a time finding ANYTHING that didn't give me blisters or pimples or a horrifying red rash. Still not sure what exactly I was reacting to, but I tried a lot of different things to fix this issue. I figured I was reacting to some commercial additive chemical, maybe a preservative because when I used raw coconut oil for lotion, I noticed it was the only thing I could buy that didn't give me that red rash. I tried many different natural shampoos, conditioners, and bodywashes and they all had some kind of additive that made my skin FREAK OUT. It looked like I had shingles for a while, it was that bad. Then I remembered that my mom's hippie friends had raved about this soap called Dr Bronners because it was pure castile soap with nothing else added. As close to 100 percent natural as soap can be. I bought some, did some experimenting, and found a recipe that worked not only for me but my entire family. It cured not only my oily hair and rash problems, but also my teenage son's acne AND my husband's dandruff. \n\nThen I started noticing that, instead of half a dozen bottles rattling around the inside of the shower, there was only the diluted Dr Bronners and a bottle of water with a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar (which is what we now use for conditioner, and it works AMAZINGLY). You don't have to buy separate bodywash at all. I've always been really frugal so I started adding up all that money we were no longer spending on specialty shampoos, conditioners and bodywash. I couldn't believe how much it was, so I figured I'd make this post.\n\nBEFORE BRONNERS, my husband and son used Harry's dandruff shampoo, $7 a bottle that lasted the two of them a week. That's 3.50 a week, per person, 50 cents per wash (we shower daily so 7 washes each). 50 cents times 2 people times 365 days a year is $365 for the two of them. \n\nI myself used Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner, about $12 for the set, and I used about 1/4 bottle a week of each because long hair. That's 3.00 a week or 42 cents a wash. I also used $8 Dove bodywash, about 1/4 bottle a week= $2 divided by 7 washes = 28 cents a wash. That's 0.70 per shower total, for me. For a whole year, 365 days, for just me, it cost $255. \n\nHousehold total before Bronners: $620 a year. \n\nAFTER BRONNERS, I buy one 32 oz bottle of liquid castile soap at Walmart for $14. It lasts us all over a month, and the only added cost now is 1 tsp of very diluted apple cider vinegar per wash, which adds about 1 extra cent. We no longer buy a bunch of different shampoos or conditioner or bodywash. The Bronners and diluted vinegar do it all.\n\nTo break it down, you dilute the castile soap, 1 part soap to 1 part water, and you use a small squirt bottle to apply the watered-down soap directly to your scalp. My 8 oz batches cost $3.75 because dig it, it's half water (only 4 oz of soap used). That 4 oz of soap lasts the three of us roughly a week, but I'll break it down per wash like before. \n\nAn 8 oz batch costs $3.75, for 3 people who do 7 washes each or 21 washes. That's 18 cents per wash, 19 cents if you add the extra penny for the diluted apple cider vinegar that is now our conditioner. 19 cents times 3 people times 365 days is $208.\n\nTotal household after Bronners, $208.\n\n The old system was $620, so Bronners saves us $412 a year. \n\nIt's not a perfect system; everyone's hair is different so you do have to do a little experimenting to come up with a mixture and routine that works for you. We add a little olive oil (about 1 tsp) to our shampoo mix and that worked for us. It took a couple of weeks to sort out that A) you have to get your hair really wet before you start shampooing, B) you have to let the vinegar water set 30 seconds, C) you have to rinse well after each step. If anyone's interested in trying this, Google Dr Bronners recipes or routines or ask me, I'd be happy to help. \n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "Perhaps not the most \"frugal\" of posts, but with a spouse who loves to drink almond milk daily, I got them an Almond Cow machine for Christmas, which can make plant milk at home. The intention behind the gift wasn't to save money, but we did do a breakdown of how long it would take to break even on the purchase.\n\nSome notes: we live in Canada, so the conversion &amp; shipping really upped the price of the machine. Almonds and almond milk are untaxed here. You can use other nuts or grains, but spouse's thing is unsweetened, unflavoured almond milk.\n\nThe instructions say you can use 1/2 the amount of almonds if you soak it (we have yet to try) and the breakdown assumes no change in cost/inflation--if only this was reality! but I didn't want to guesstimate\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6m4tur113h8a1.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86f9265218dc87327e457e30160d9dcfbd5cde8b\n\nSome initial thoughts on the machine, for anyone curious about it or a similar product:\n\n* The milk actually tastes like almonds, which is nice. I'm not much of an almond drinker, but I would actually drink this. My spouse also likes the taste more than store-bought.\n* It's not as thick as store-bought, it is more runny, but the viscosity change isn't an issue for my spouse\n* You also get to keep the leftover nut pulp, which can be used for other things such as baking, eating like oatmeal, etc \n* Nice that there are no additives and less material/carton waste (the main reason it was purchased)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I would say using a good blender &amp; cheesecloth gives you the exact same results without having to dish out $255 USD or $450 CAD, or you could use that money to invest in a quality blender that has more uses. There might be something to be said about the convenience factor that makes us more likely to use it, but... I wish we had tried the old school blender/cheesecloth way first to see how manageable that was for us.",

I am lucky to have a store nearby that sells food at or near sell-by-date for a substantial discount. I bought four quarts of heavy cream for 1/2 of their normal price.\n\nI used one for some baking and turned the second one into butter. For me this means using my mixer and whip blade. It is relatively easy - over whip the cream till it separates, squeeze out the buttermilk (which you can drink or use) and wash it to remove the liquid. \n\nI plan to make the other into butter as well\n\nmy plan is to now see how well my homemade butter works to make ghee.\n\nI also had some leftover grapes from making a salad. I do not eat that much fruit so I dehydrated them and some berries. Now I have salad or rice mixers. (You do not have to have a dehydrator - the oven will work as well).\n\nOf course this takes time and work, but it feels quite satisfying. I remember the scene from castaway when Tom Hank's character made fire and he was quite proud.  \n\nI just hope to encourage anyone who wants to try something different.",
