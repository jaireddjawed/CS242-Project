        "text": "“Professor Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, a German experimental physicist, suffers from an occupational handicap common to academics: having to sit through endless, often boring, conferences. To alleviate this burden, he invented a private activity that provides just enough challenges for him not to be completely bored during a dull lecture, but is so automated that it leaves enough attention free so that if something interesting is being said, it will register his awareness. What he does is this: whenever a speaker begins to get tedious, he starts to tap his right thumb once, then the third finger of the right hand, then the index finger, then the fourth finger, then the third finger again, and then the little finger of the right hand. Then he moves to the left hand and taps the little finger, the middle finger, the fourth finger, the index, and the middle finger again, and ends with the thumb on the left hand. Then the right hand reverses the sequence of the tapping, followed by the reverse of the left hand’s sequence. It turns out that by introducing full and half stops at regular intervals, there are 888 combinations one can move through without repeating the same pattern” someone explain I just don’t get it. How is there no repetition if it’s repeating back and forth?",

I love sci-fi, and for a certain part of a story, there is a character underwater, and I realized that if I wanted to depict this part realistically, I would have to explain how he deals with preassure (among other things hahaha)\n What led me to think more about this topic, which has always intrigued me and I know little about. \"If you go too deep into the sea, preassure will kill you.\" \nHow does it work? What does preassure exactly mean? What happens when you are exposed to that pressure? What kills you exactly? What would happen if you were too deep without a diving suit? What happens to your body? Why does pressure exist?  I realized I dont really understand it. What is the limit? How deep can a submarine go without breaking? And a human with a diving suit? And without it? Explain EVRYTHING about preassure underwater and the reason why it occurs. \nOf course, I have a vague idea about all I am asking, I mean, I know more or less where the answers are going, but still I want certainties and science based answers.",

This link will limit the accessibility part and perhaps even take a hit with SEO, considering (good) bots won't be able to crawl this element.\n\nBut considering the original element is a button, it's still technically 'accessible' via keyboard navigation. And since it's redirecting to an external URL, we don't mind the link not being indexed. \n\nSo... is this now acceptable?",
