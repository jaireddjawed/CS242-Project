        "text": "So the business I work for sells different kinds of salt, like thawing salt, cattle salt, table salt… you get the idea. We also have a variation of chemical supplies and provide maintenance service for water installations. Most of our customers are big companies, but we do have many people who come in to buy small packages of salt from us (we’re cheaper than most other stores because we get it straight from the producer).\nOne day I sat at the front desk, doing my business when the phone rang. Of course I picked it up and answered with my usual greeting.\n\nME: Yours truly \nTL: Telephone Lady\n\n&gt;ME: Hello, this is ME from Salt Company. How can I help you today?\n&gt;TL: Yes, hello, I’d like to get an offer for salt.\n\nNow, most of the time we use list prices, but if people want it delivered or take a certain amount the price can vary. To do this on phone is very time consuming and complicated, so normally we ask our customers to send us a mail with what exactly they want, where they want it and how much they want.\n\n&gt;ME: Alright, could you please send me a mail with what you want at myname@mycompany.com? It’s much easier for me to process your request this way and I can make sure I don’t make any mistakes and get you the best offer possible.\n&gt;TL: Oh, so you can’t be contacted by phone?\n\nNow I slowly turn my head and look at the phone in my hand through which I’m speaking with her. She probably meant to ask if we couldn’t do the offer over phone, I thought. But I was wrong.\n\n&gt;ME: We can be contacted by phone, Ma’am, but my boss wants inquiry’s in written form an in a mail I’ll have all the information I need to make you a good offer.\n&gt;TL (not angry, but confused): I can’t believe you can’t be contacted by phone! Everyone I know has a phone! \n&gt;ME: We do have a phone, after all you called me.\n&gt;TL: You just said you couldn’t be contacted over phone!\n&gt;ME: Ma’am, I said you have to send me a mail with what exactly you want, so I can make you an offer. It’s just easier for me.\n&gt;TL: Oh, well, okay. I’ll send you one. \n&gt;ME: Thank you, can I do anything else for you?\n&gt;TL: Yes, you could talk to your boss, so he can purchase a few phones for your store.\n&gt;ME: … I will, thank you and have a nice day.\n\nTl;dr\nLady called me and then apparently thought I could answer her through my crystal ball.\n\n\n\n",

And he won't take them in treats. He's also a little land shark.\n\nThis 4.7 pound dog doesn't discriminate if you get near his face, and will lash out with teeth at anyone stupid enough to get within bite range. Today I was training two new girls to work in the kennel.\n\nWorking in the kennel involves knowing how to hold animals properly; something in which this new girl is. Well. New at. \n\nAfter the doctor stands there watching me struggle to get the muzzle onto this dog, he chastises me for doing it by myself. I had been bitten two times (nothing serious thankfully.) and not once had he stepped in. And being in the moment I had forgotten to redirect the new girl. \n\nThe doctor grabs the dog from me, and beckons to the new girl.\n\n\"Put your hand right here, over the top of the dog's head. Then you feel for the vertebra, and squeeze on either side. I call it the Vulcan Death Grip.\" \n\nCharlie struggles for a little bit, completely losing his shit at one moment, flopping around.  He slowly curls up the same way a bug would after it dies, and immediately lies still. \n\nNow I panic because this dog has a heart condition. Meanwhile the doctor pokes the dog and shakes him.\n\n\"You're fine. You're ok.\"\n\nNew girl in the corner, is looking at me, and then the doc. And then the dog. \n\nFinally the dog pops his head up and looks blearily at the doctor. Doctor shrugs his shoulders like nothing happened, and then continues to demonstrate how much control you have over the head. \n\nLater on I explained to the new girl, that had we caused that much stress to an animal, being kennel, we would have been disciplined. And rightfully so. She looks at me and asks,\n\n\"So don't use the Vulcan death grip?\" \n\n\n\n\nI cringed. \"Yeah. Don't.\"\n\nThat evening, without the doctor present, I went over how to do it properly. ",

Trust me.  I hate sending these e-mails as much as you probably dislike receiving them.  \nHowever, I do need to make sure we are all on the same page…singing from the same sheet of music.  \n\n\nDress Code\nThe screen shots below come straight out of the Employee Handbook.  The sections that would apply to all of you would be General Dress Code and Non-Clinical Administration Personnel.\nI understand everyone may interpret some of the bullet points below differently.  A few that might require more insight?\n\nBeach/rubber sandals.  No flip flops folks.  If the shoe looks like this, you should not wear it.  Moreover, like it reads below, if we can ‘hear you walking’ the shoe is not appropriate for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only time tennis shoes are appropriate for work is when you are wearing a logo shirt with khakis or if it is an approved jeans day – and they should be predominately white.  \nCapri pants should at least come to mid-calf.  If they are above mid-calf, they are not work appropriate.\nPants made of spandex.  Our interpretation of this would be anything form/tight fitting like Lularoe leggings or any other leggings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nPersonal Telephone Calls &amp; Technology\nThe screen shots below come straight out of the Employee Handbook.  In addition to what is illustrated below, please keep this in mind:\n1.\tIn addition to using your electronics/phones during lunch you may also use them during your break.  However, please make sure you are away from your desk so that we don’t confuse the issue.\n2.\tManagers will have their devices out for work related purposes.  Many, many meetings and we cannot miss important e-mails or texts.\n3.\tIf you need to make an emergency call that may require more time than normal, please let your manager know.\n4.\tAs you know, calls at any time may be monitored.  In addition, ShoreTel reports will be run randomly.  Don’t leave yourself vulnerable.\n\n \nWork Schedules\nAs much as we might like to, we cannot make our own schedules.  \nArriving late constitutes tardiness.\nLeaving early requires written authorization from a manager.  \nPlease utilize AOD to appropriately request time off.\nLunches should be taken between 11-2 unless permission is given otherwise.\n\nParking\nThere is a map that illustrates where everyone in this suite should be parking.  That map is located on the breakroom door.  PLEASE take time to make sure you are parking in the correct areas.  I know a few are not and I want you to have the opportunity to resolve it.\n\nWhiteboards\nWhiteboards are intended to be used for business related content.  Unfortunately, most look very personalized and appear to be more message boards than anything.  I would like to ask folks to clean these up…\n\nDesk Eating\nBreakfast should be eaten before you arrive to work.  You should not be eating breakfast at your desk – much less making it when you arrive.\nLunch cannot be eaten at your desk.  You must take your lunch and you must eat your lunch either in the breakroom or offsite.\nYou may snack at your desk.  Cracker, chips, trail mix, Junior Mints …etc. are acceptable snack items.\n\n\nI really apologize for the length of this e-mail.  Ultimately, I hope you appreciate the information and I hope you find it helpful.  If you have any questions, please let me know.\n\n",

Nothing unusual about that, we often had discussions as the startup only had about 50 employees.  But today, my DBA (let's call him, Jack Gardner) was out of the office because it was his birthday.  The meeting wasn't called off, we had enough that we could talk about without him being there.\n\nAbout 10 minutes into the meeting the receptionist knocks on the door to interrupt.  She sheepishly says, \"There's someone outside asking for Jack Gardner.  I'm pretty sure she's a stripper.\"  Now, I started the meeting letting everybody there know that Jack was out of the office because of his birthday, but with no hesitation what so ever, the CEO says, \"Well tell her I'm Jack Gardner.\"  The receptionist leaves apparently to carry out this instruction.\n\nSo I'm a pretty conservative guy, and it happens that in our small conference room I sat furthest from the door and would have to crawl over someone to make an exit.  I'm contemplating my escape when the receptionist returns.  \"She left.\", she says.  The others moan disapproval while I sign relief.  By the look on her face, I'd guess that the receptionist sent her away, but I never confirmed this with her.",

This is a combined total failure of workers and customer working together to a storm cloud of wtf. A couple weeks ago I entered the costume contest during Time Traveler's weekend at the renn faire I usually work. I wasn't working then so I'm a fellow patron. As we're all waiting I overhear a woman asking about having fire fans on stage for her turn.\nThe organizer said \"Well, it's a costume contest not a performance, but I guess it's ok if short.\" I almost went to have security radioed to alert them of such, but at the moment we got called to line up, so I missed the chance. We go up in turns, I do my thing &amp; go to the back of the audience area to wait again.\n\nThen the clusterf*ck happens. This woman comes on stage &amp; I can only assume she's never actually used fire fans before. If I did the pics properly you can see the fluid flying. Her fans were way oversoaked in fluid. She flung fluid all over, she stayed way long for her turn, &amp; she didn't put the fans out before finally leaving the stage.\n\nShe walked, with full on still flaming fans, down the middle aisle of a full crowd!!! The people running the contest failed here cause they didn't make her put out the fire before leaving the stage. They basically just moved on &amp; completely ignored everything that happened afterwards like she ceased to be their problem the moment her feet left the stage area.\n\nShe then stood on the hay covered sidewalk area behind the audience between 2 booths not even trying to put out the fans! I immediately went over to the closest soda booths to radio security as this woman just posed for people with cameras like she was having a personal shoot.\n\nThankfully, security was coming around the corner at the same time so they came up behind her to stop this. The woman actually argued with them for a moment before being forced to put out her fans &amp; escorted out of the faire. I advised my friend on security of how the contest organizers told her she could use fire &amp; then let her walk off without any attempt to control the situation. I heard later how the contest people got deeply chewed out for allowing it in the first place without alerting the faire. They wouldn't have even necessarily said no, it just would have been better monitored &amp; would have been shut down the second her soaked fans started spraying fluid everywhere. Considering how much dry leaves, hay, and etc is on site they're INCREDIBLY lucky she didn't start a fire or hurt anyone.\n\n(Btw, minor brag, I won 2nd place that day for my Doctor Who Idris look.

I performed the deed and left a note for managment.\n\nManagement is the boss' son. The boss' son ain't too bright. He's the tech support. I cringed and Monday morning told him; \"the computer is working, but it's got no memory space left.\"\n\nHe asks if it's crashing. I said no and told him about the disk clean up. He completely shit himself. \n\nHe acted like I deleted every client file from yesterday to the 80's. Then claimed he had to call \"suchandsuch\" company. Because they are the ones responsible for the full hard drive. \n\nThe company he's talking about is for the program we use to clock in and out. It has nothing to do with the physical drive.\n\n\"Just leave it alone. Ill get to it. \"\n\nI did my chores. And I watched that computer run out of memory and crash. He comes to me later.\n\n\"I thought you said it was working???\"\n\n\n\nHoly fucking hell.",

        "text": "I wasn't sure where to post this, because there isn't a /r/talesfromsocialwork (oh wait, there is... oh well...) or /r/talesfromrehab (that I know of, anyway). So here seemed as good as any place! Also, first time poster, so my apologies for any errors or formatting issues​ (on mobile). Also, sorry that this is so long! I felt the need to explain a lot of things.\n\nI am a social worker and I work at a substance abuse treatment center as an intake person. My job (or part of it, anyway) is basically to assess clients who come in for treatment, determine the most appropriate level of care for them (inpatient, outpatient, etc), and then call their insurance company to get treatment authorized. Fun fact about substance abuse treatment: Even if your insurance company says that you have benefits for treatment, they won't necessarily pay for your treatment unless you \"qualify.\" The purpose of a prior authorization (required by the vast majority of insurances) is so that your treatment center staff can convince the insurance company that you need that level of care right now. \n\nMoving on. A few weeks ago, I had a terrible, horrible experience with a new client. Now, I pretty much always give clients the benefit of the doubt, because I know that they are likely a) intoxicated at time of assessment, b) withdrawing from drugs and miserable at time of assessment, or c) suffering from other mental health conditions​ that make life difficult. So if people are jerks to me, I just let it go and don't hold it against them. \n\nBut this guy, he was a whole other story. He had [major insurance company] and had a small copay that would be due at the time of admission. Because of his circumstances (idk what, since we never do this normally), we were waiving the copay and my admissions person had told me that several days earlier. But, being a busy and forgetful person, I forgot. My bad entirely. \n\nOkay, so during the assessment, the guy got really worked up because I was asking so many questions. I'll be M (me), he'll be RG (guy), and his girlfriend will be GF.\n\nRG: I don't understand, the admissions person already asked all of these questions. This is a waste of time.\n\nM: I'm sorry. She usually doesn't ask any of the same questions​ that I ask, so that's strange. I have to ask these questions tho, because I need the answers to get the prior authorization.\n\nRG: She did ask all of the same questions. \n\nGF: It's true, I was there when he was on the phone with her.\n\nM: Are you sure it wasn't another treatment center that asked these questions?\n\nRG: No! It was this one! Are you accusing us of lying?\n\nM (panicking a little): No, of course not. Now, moving on...\n\nAfter we finished the assessment, I had him sign a few things and informed him of his copay (like $150 total for the whole admission, I think, so pretty low compared to most that I see). We require all applicable copays and deductibles to be paid at the of admission, because we would never get the money otherwise. We inform people of their benefits before they come in, to avoid misunderstandings and freak outs. Well, he flipped out. \n\nRG: What do you mean I have a $150 copay?? I can't pay that! I definitely can't pay it today!! Why didn't anyone tell me about this??\n\nM (heart sinking): [Admissions​ person] always informs people of their copays before they come in. When could you pay it? \n\nRG: Never! I was never told about this, I would remember!\n\nM (suddenly remembering that the copay was waived for someone and it could be this guy): Let me call my admissions person, maybe there's something I don't know. \n\nRG: Yeah, do that! I can't believe we drove all this way for this! (I forgot to mention that they lived 4 hours away from us).\n\nI called my admissions person and she confirmed that the copay was waived. \n\nM: I am so sorry that I freaked you out. We are waiving the copay. Again, I am so sorry, I didn't know. \n\nRG: Damn right! God, my blood pressure has got to be through the roof! *mumbles about incompetence*\n\nAt the end of the assessment, I took them both back to our waiting area and informed them that I would call the insurance company for the prior authorization and it shouldn't take too long. If he was authorized, we would admit him at that time. I left them (and they looked calm and normal) and called the insurance company and got the authorization. I had to fight a little for it too, as a side note. I went to find them, and couldn't find them anywhere. So I called RG's cell phone. \n\nRG: Hello?\n\nM: Hi, this is starggg from [treatment center]! Where are you? I wanted to let you know that you were authorized, so we can get you admitted now.\n\nRG: Oh, we left. We're out by [place at least 30 minutes away] now. I just didn't like how I was treated there. That lady in the admin office (he meant me, but he didn't realize that he was talking to the same person as before, I guess) was so rude to us. She accused us of lying and kept badgering me for this copay that I can't pay. \n\nM (a little shellshocked): Well, I'm sorry you had that experience.\n\nI finished the call with him and had to go cancel the authorization with the insurance. I was pretty mad, because I apologized so damn much about the copay confusion and I didn't think I had been rude! I told my supervisor what had happened, and he assured me that I didn't do anything wrong. \n\nNow, here's the kicker. He called again two weeks later and asked to be admitted. This time his parents brought him (I guess the gf broke up with him after the last time because she was sick of his drinking). I told my admissions person that she'd better find someone else to do the assessment, because I wasn't going to do it, but there was no one else available, so yay me. When I told him that we needed to do a mini-assessment because the last auth was cancelled since he didn't stay and the insurance needs updated info, he flipped out. But his parents calmed him down and he did the assessment calmly. However, he ended up telling me that he was suicidal with a specific plan to kill himself that day, so I told him and his parents that we needed to send him to the hospital to get him a psych eval. We don't have enough staff to do suicide watch on clients if they are acutely suicidal, so we have to get the hospital to clear them. He freaked, and said that he didn't mean it and he only said it because he thought he needed to say that to get authorized (funny, because he wasn't suicidal the last time and he got authorized, so he should know better...). But we had to send him anyway and he was pissed about it. When he came back the next day, he was calmer and I had to do another freaking assessment on him and finally call the insurance to get the authorization. He was authorized, no problem. I still don't like him. Arg.",

        "text": "This happened around 3 years ago. I was working at a bakery and not making enough money to make ends meet, so I got onto Craigslist and searched around. Eventually, I got a response from a guy who owned a small insurance company. I'll call him Gary. There was a website setup for this place, so it seemed legitimate. He was looking for a admin-type of assistant for around $13 per hour. This would have been just enough for me to get by, so I agreed to setup an interview.\n\nGary suggested that we hold the interview at a Starbucks near his house, so I drove the long way outside of the city to his local coffee shop and met him inside. To give you a better picture: he was tall, very obese, and sitting just inside the door and to the right. I sat down with him and got started with the interview.\n\nIt was fairly normal at first. He explained the position and that I would need to pay a pretty large sum of money each month for my own healthcare, which made the whole $13 per hour not very appealing. Then, he started ranting about who I would be replacing. Apparently, the woman that worked for him before got tired of his crap and left recently. He gave me a long backstory about how close they were and how upset he was about her quitting after a decade. We also talked about some casual topics, like exercise and diet. I didn't bring this up btw, he just thought it made sense to share his exercise routine. \n\nHalf-way through the interview, he gets a phone call. He doesn't seem concerned at all that he's in the middle of an interview and proceeds to chat with a friend and catch up. He starts sharing **the details of his colonoscopy** with the caller: how it went, the steps, the aftermath, the results, etc. I'm completely shocked and unsure what to do at this point. I'm looking around and feeling the other Starbucks patrons judging me for staying in the interview. I want to leave, but this happened at a point in my life when I had trouble standing up for myself. I was also desperate to find a new job, as my current boss was verbally abusive to his employees. Looking back, it seems like the phone call was a test of how far he could push me, but maybe that is just a paranoid thought. \n\nHe gets off the phone and we continue with the interview. He tells me that the position is remote, so I can do it from my home, adding that I better not slack off and clock hours when I'm not working (jumping the gun a bit). He announces that I have the job and we shake hands. I was surprised that Gary offered me the job, considering the awkward encounter and my lack of experience with insurance and admin-type responsibilities. \n\nHe emails me later on asking me what name I prefer to go by (I have a nickname). His emails are unprofessional (no \"Hello ___\" or signature) and his tone is always defensive. After a week or so, I haven't heard back from him about my start date or when I would head into the office to sign paperwork. After consulting my family about this situation, I decide to send an assertive email asking for the next steps. He responds, clearly angry, telling me that he's not going to hire me until I've quit my old job and that my first day will be at *his house* outside of the city. I actually had quit my job at this point, which was a really stupid move, so I felt vulnerable and worried about my financial situation if this didn't pan out right. \n\nThe whole *his house* thing really didn't sit well with me. He wanted to train me there for a few weeks. He was still a stranger to me and made me feel uncomfortable, so I didn't want to step foot near his house. As the start date approached, he started to send me more details about getting to his house. I still hadn't signed any agreements, so I wasn't sure if the job really existed or not. I tried to research the company more online and didn't find much, besides the crappy website. \n\nI was still job hunting at this point and heard back from another company that I later did get a job at. I sent Gary an email telling him that I took a different position, which was really hard for me to do, but I knew that this wasn't about being \"nice\" anymore. It was about having a stable job in a safe environment, which I'm sure Gary's house wouldn't have been.",

        "text": "I've been working in computing for over 20 years, and I've had some interesting on-site training sessions during that time. But the training I just had in the past two days will definitely stay with me for a while. I was expecting two days of stupefying boredom, but instead I was hilariously entertained.\n\nSome background: our company has recently started to roll out a new methodology for streamlining the software process. Let's call it the Zombo method. At first, management has tried to implement this on their own, but they've discovered that just reading the book and winging it doesn't really work, so now they've decided to cave and buy the training. It's a pretty invasive change, with teams being reorganized, a new way of planning, working, releasing and so on. The R&amp;D department, which I'm a part of, is understandably skeptical.\n\nTo roll out Zombo, management has been given a training, and now the rest of us are in for this treat too, spread out over two days. Seems reasonable. I've decided to consider it a fairly pointless two-day vacation from work; let's see what happens.\n\nThe first strange thing is that the trainer doesn't introduce himself at the beginning of the course. It might be because some of us were waiting for him in the wrong conference room at first due to some mixup, but still, several dozen people enter the right conference room a few minutes late, and the guy doesn't tell his name. I still have no idea what he's called, so I guess we're going to have to refer to him as The Trainer.\n\nSitting down at a table, I find myself seated beside a colleague, let's call him Mark, who's in a foul mood. He explains the following to me:\n\n* His team is currently in a state of limbo, and it's unclear what they are going to be doing.\n* The person who should have told them what to do, their manager, was hired a few months back and has done nothing at all to help them.\n* Instead, this manager has spent all her time pitching Zombo to the company, and almost immediately after doing so, has quit.\n\nMark will spend the entire two days griping about everything and anything The Trainer (who is not connected to that manager in any way as far as I know) has to say, dismissing him as a marketing guy trying to hawk Zombo to us. This is obviously puzzling to The Trainer, who patiently tries to extol the virtues of Zombo (sometimes sounding like he's making a sales pitch, yes, but mostly explaining fairly dry technical details).\n\nBut the pushback doesn't come from Mark alone. Many other colleagues are also getting into discussions with the trainer, slowing down the training. This is for several reasons:\n\n* It's becoming clear during the training that management has misunderstood important parts of Zombo, and is misimplementing it. For example, they told us that being reorganized into new teams might be a bitch, but that the problems would resolve themselves and things would stabilize in about three months. The Trainer clearly disagrees with that estimate. The Trainer also keeps having to say that he gave the managers a pretty hard time, but nobody seriously believes that management is going to make a radical change themselves. \n* The Trainer is seeing problems that don't really exist. For example, much time is spent on emphasizing that geographically distributed teams are terrible, even though the entire R&amp;D team is used to working that way. We stopped having issues with videoconferencing years ago, people ping each other using instant messaging all the time, etc.\n\nAll of our criticism is obviously getting to the guy, but he's acting professionally, deflecting questions with vague generalities and playing question-and-answer games that somehow always turn out to demonstrate the benefits of Zombo. My colleagues aren't buying it, and the mood is gloomy.\n\nAfter a lunch break, we do some exercise, with different employees presenting their results. This is where I first start noticing that The Trainer is sitting on his chair, clearly nodding off. This will happen multiple times during the two days. He doesn't outright fall asleep, but he's got his eyes closed and is obviously about to doze off. (A colleague, who was generally not so adverse to the training, said that he noticed it too and confronted The Trainer with it, who told him that it was because of his \"condition\" --whatever that means.)\n\nThe first real drama happens in the afternoon of Day 1. The group is supposed to do some group exercise designed to demonstrate the value of teamwork; I won't bore you with the details, but let's say it's a fairly childish exercise for a bunch of grown men to do. \n\nMaybe that's why one of my colleagues, let's call him Ivan, a Russian guy, suddenly decides that he doesn't want to participate; he says he'll \"observe\" instead. The Trainer isn't having it, insisting that participation is the whole point of an exercise designed to point out the value of teamwork. Or to put it another way, he doesn't like that Ivan is not playing along with proving the point he's trying to make, and is undermining his authority. They have a tense standoff for several minutes, with neither of them backing down, while the rest of the group is deadly silent. The Trainer wants to send Ivan out of the room, but Ivan won't do that either. Eventually, they talk one-on-one in a corner, as the rest of the group takes an awkward coffee break, and after a few minutes, Ivan turns out to have been somehow convinced to stay and participate.\n\nNo less awkward is when The Trainer tries to illustrate the beauty of a highly efficient team by showing us a YouTube video of the haka dance as performed by the All Blacks, the New Zealand rugby team. I'm sure you've seen it: the team does a traditional dance involving menacing gestures, chanting, and sticking out of tongues. It's a lot of fun to watch, but The Trainer gets weirdly emotional: he's on the verge of tears, apparently deeply moved by the amazing teamwork. Maybe someone should have told him that a sports team doesn't make for a great metaphor to a room full of software developers. Again, an awkward silence hangs in the room.\n\nApart from this, the training is riddled with mishaps: the projector isn't working right, The Trainer projects onto a wall filled with Post-its and presentations so that nothing is readable, etc. There are also many cases of the trainer starting to clap at some group member's show-and-tell, with only a few people joining in to create a very unenthusiastic smattering of applause.\n\nBy the time Day 2 rolls around, the trainer is making little effort trying to hide his \"OK, let's just get through this shit\" attitude, and most of the group seems to agree with him at least on this point. At this stage, he's conceded to our criticisms enough that he's willing to say, over and over, that this transition is not going to be easy, that it'll be painful in the beginning etc. Which of course makes the group even more unwilling to play along.\n\nAlso, he's a bulky guy, and I can't help noticing his beer belly showing below his T-shirt, as well as a reminder of [a certain Magic: The Gathering tournament](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/202wd3/i_participated_in_one_of_the_biggest_magic_the/). \n\nWe spend almost the entire second day covering a basic methodology we already use, so most of the group are bored out of their minds relearning what they've already been doing for several years, with the added joy of being told by an outsider that they've been doing it wrong all this time.\n\nAs the day is nearing its end, the trainer wants us to do a little exercise: take the evaluation technique we've just learned and apply it to the training itself: what went well, what didn't go so well, what might he improve? Again, awkwardness reigns supreme as the group considers how honest they want to be. Not unsurprisingly, it's Mark who speaks up first, calling the training \"boring\" and noting as a positive point that he got a free lunch out of it. The trainer gulps audibly and dutifully takes down the barrage of criticism that follows as other group members join the fray. \n\nAnd so we slowly limp toward the end of the 2nd day. The finish line is in sight and we can all go home. But wait, what's this? At 5:15 PM, friend Ivan decides that The Trainer is not getting off so easy. He says that the course is pointless, that the vague claims about its purported success rate are not substantiated, and that The Trainer's claim that this has worked for hundreds of other companies doesn't count for anything. \n\nAt this point, The Trainer decides to throw a hissy fit and announces that if this is how it's going to be, he's going to quit. (Remember, there's maybe half an hour left on the clock.) He dramatically hands his next-PowerPoint-slide-clicker to Ivan (\"if you know it all, why don't *you* do the training!\") and unplugs his computer, clearly threatening to storm off in a huff.\n\nI'm honestly not sure if at this point, he expected someone to go, \"No, wait, stay! Ivan doesn't speak for all of us!\" As it is, nobody tries to stop him, he calms down, returns to face the group, and to make the humiliation complete, has none other than Mark intervene on his behalf, defuse the tension somewhat, and have a reasonably open conversation about what's bothering the group. The training still goes on for another hour or so. In the end, rather than thanking us, or us thanking him, he simply says, \"You can go if you like as far as I'm concerned,\" which the group gratefully accepts as a sign that the training is over.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to learn that the trainer maxed out his per diem at the hotel bar that night on hard liquor. But if I'm going to be asked to score the training, I fully intend to check all the \"Very Satisfied\" boxes. I haven't enjoyed a training this much in years.",

        "text": "It was a cold Monday morning in November. I took my morning deuce around 9:00AM. As I was sitting there a thought came to mind, \"What if I took away ALL the toilet paper? And the person after me had to drop a deuce so bad that he didn't even check to see if there was any available?\"\n\n\nI wrestled with this for a moment. I'm usually a low-key guy who doesn't like seeing people get messed with. Stand-up. Mature.\n\n\nWell, the office was stale for a while (not a lot of exciting news). So I decided to play a little TP prank. However, instead of taking ALL the toilet paper away, I decided to leave a \"lifeline\" for the victim. I took away all the spare rolls but left the roll that was already in the holder. This way, the victim is comforted by the fact that there is TP available. BUT, here's the twist: I loosened the toilet paper holder from the wall/divider so if the victim tried unraveling the TP, it would fall, throwing the victim into a nervous frenzy.\n\n\nThe bathroom is down the hall from my office. I anxiously answered emails while wondering if my prank was a success. A client gave me a ring and I was indulged into a conversation with him about our Q1 strategy until I heard \"Ahhhh ouhhhh f***!!!!!!\" coming from the bathroom.\n\n\nImmediately, I knew someone fell victim to the prank. As I was hanging up the phone, I saw a stampede of co-workers rushing to the front to check what the commotion was. There were about 5 co-workers standing outside the Mens room. Bryan (IT Manager) opened the door, only to see the roll toilet paper sprawled out all over the bathroom floor, while the VP of our firm was yelling profanities.\n\n\nBryan: You alright?\n\nVP: Aww f***! Get me TP!\n\nBryan: What happened?\n\nVP: The holder broke and the TP fell, hit my foot, and rolled out under the stall!\n\nBryan: Ok here.. (while picking up the roll and handing it to him under the stall door).\n\nVP: If I find out who loosened the holder he'll be fired! \n\n\nUnfortunately, the embarrassment didn't end there. Not only did 1/2 the office know of this charade, but about 3 customers who were standing in the lobby heard the shrieks coming from the bathroom as well. \n\n\nThe VP was so mad that he began an investigation to see who played the prank. Yes, an investigation. He had the secretary gather bathroom times. Everyone who used the mens room during 8AM-11AM had to be interrogated. My name was on the list. However, the VP has his eyes set on another co-worker.\n\n\nWe'll see.",

        "text": "Hey all, I've got another story for you from a few years ago.\n\nI used to work in a big-box store. My management team at this job was really in to this idea of \"do above and beyond what they need all the time\", just often times didn't put it into practice.\n\nOne day, during patio season (Mid June-July) I was working in garden, and a nice older couple came in. Like many people they'd come do their shopping, and have a seat in the nice comfy patio chairs. Unfortunately, my management felt this was impeding on OTHERS buying the product, and came up to talk to me.\n\nManager: Pierogi! Pieorgi, those two there. Get them out of those chairs! If they want to sit in 'em, they can take 'em home. We got quotas to meet!\n\nMe: Alright, I'll go talk to them. They just might've gotten a little tired from shopping.\n\nManager: That's fine, but we have benches for that.\n\nNow, at the time I lived in a small town of about 8,000 people. Most folks either went to church with you, their kids went to school with you, or both. These folks were new to me.\n\nMe: Hello there! Can I help ya'll today?\n\nMan: Oh! Just what we needed! We were just enjoying this great couch! We were talking about getting us one, but we don't have a way to get it to our house.\n\nMe: Well, we don't normally do deliveries, but let me see what I can do.\n\nMan: Y'see Franny? Thats great customer service!!\n\nI walked away happily, looking for my manager to ask him about delivery, only to find him looking for me!\n\nManager: Where have you been?! There's people waiting in garden!!\n\nMe: Those folks wanna buy that couch.\n\nManager: Then let them! They don't need you to do that!\n\nMe: Actually, they wanted us to deliver it.\n\nManager: We don't do that!\n\nMe: ...I could deliver it, I have a bigger car and...\n\nManager: No, then you'd need to leave.\n\nMe: They're willing to wait.\n\nManager: Fine, you wanna do it, Fine! Do it after your shift, but you're not getting overtime!\n\nMe: That's fine by me.\n\nAnd so I did. I got the couple's phone number and address, plugged it into my GPS, and went for it. Then I ran into a major problem:\n\nThe set was 5 assembled chairs, and a couch. At the time, I drove a Chevy Equinox, and while i could definitely fit 5 chairs, I couldn't fit the couch in one trip.\n\nDetermined, I decided to do what I had learned from being a southerner my whole life:\n\nRope and Duct tape fix all things.\n\nI got all of the chairs into my vehicle, (albeit by rolling down all the windows and having the legs stick out like evil pyres of death from within..) and had one of my co-workers fetch a ladder for me. (Without my manager seeing, that is.)\n\nI grabbed the couch, hoisting it on to the top of my car, while another of my co-workers tied it to the rear hitch of my car. (I knew that thing'd come in handy one day.) After some finangling, I got it attached, but I had one remaining problem...\n\nMy trunk, which was already ajar from the chairs inside the car, was flapping in the breeze, so to speak, like a wiggle man at a used car lot.\n\nSo, using my training as a then 20-year-old garden associate armed with only the wit of my forefathers and a roll of duct tape, I taped that son of a bitch down like I was Dexter and Jed Clampett'd it to the customer's home.\n\nI called the customer, who met me outside, grinning from ear to ear at the sight of my amalgamation of car and chair.\n\nMan: Now that's customer service! What do I owe you?\n\nNow, one thing you should know about me is that I have an extremely hard time taking money from people for the things that I do. I like to be helpful, and get great joy from doing so...HOWEVER, in this particular case, I was dehydrated, most likely bleeding, and had whacked myself in the head to near concussion. I could've at least asked him for a cold drink, right?\n\nMe: Not a thing, It's my pleasure. Thank you for shopping at ***.\n\nI turned around to my car, when I was stopped by the man's wife, who grabbed my hand and shook it, sticking a piece of paper into it.\n\nMe: Thank you. (opens hand) Ma'am, this is a $100 bill. I-\n\nWoman: No, that's right. We heard your manager talking to you. You're worth a lot more than that hundred dollar bill, too. Remember that.\n\nShe reached up and patted my cheek, as only knowing, grandmotherly ladies can.\n\nI took her words to heart. About a month later, I was \"released\" for \"lack of customer response surveys\" or something like that. The manager had me escorted out because \"its just policy.\" Thankfully, the security guard was a friend of mine, and let me walk out on my own, giving me a brotherly hug and handshake as I left.\n\nI later got a job just down the road from that job, at a truck stop, and the lady and her husband came in one day, and were excited to see me. They even bragged about me to my new manager.\n\nGod bless those two.",

Day 1 this epic chicken place that has open flame rotisserie chicken. Day 2 pizza (because of course its pizza), Day 3 usually a sub or sandwich from anywhere except subway. \n\nIts the day 3 sandwich which brought down an HR dinosaur. \n\nTwo months ago this was the email. \n\n*There are a large number of unclaimed free lunches. Please go ahead and take these home if you wish. The free lunches are a thank you from the company and may disappear if they are not taken advantage of. Thank you.* \n\nWelp... the free lunches that were not claimed were chicken salad sandwiches. \n\nLast month same email followed by emails from our section heads to each individual person who badged out to go somewhere else. \n\nHe sent me an email basically stating the same thing and asking why I did not partake. My response was...\n\n*I chose not to partake in the free lunch today because, unfortunately, by the time I got down there to grab mine all that was left was chicken salad sandwiches.* \n\n*I do not like chicken salad. I do not mean to offend anyone and that is why I badge out through the side exit and slip off to whataburger or something else.*\n\n*If this is an issue I will stop. I just chose not to eat chicken salad and to be honest if I did grab a box it would not be ate by me.*\n\nHis response was a laugh and saying he would pass on the message. Apparently a LOT of people had the same concerns as yesterday afternoon we got this email. \n\n*Due to the selfishness of several individuals, we will not be ordering chicken salad again. I apologize to everyone who likes it but unfortunately we have some selfish people in the office who can only think for themselves. Tomorrow the flavors are, turkey and bacon, roast beef and cheddar, and tuna.*\n\nFollowed by a flood of emails to section heads basically saying WTF. \n\nThis morning SOME people who had outlook open got this email. \n\n*Seeing as no one can be happy with sensible choices in sandwich styles we will not have lunch anymore. I would like to point out that not only are Tuna sandwiches and Chicken Salad sandwiches tasty. They are also healthy for you. IF you can not be selfless enough to simply eat a damn tuna sandwich then you do not deserve one. Thank you and have a bad day.*\n\nThe email was scrubbed from the server, but those who left their outlook open already received it. This morning a new email was sent out. \n\n*We wish ____ luck in her future endeavors and understand her reasons for leaving _____ company. Today we will simply double up on pizza and next month we will utilize a spreadsheet so we can order a personalized selection for sandwich days. Thank you.*\n\nSo TL:DR Lady who orders lunch for the office as a thank you got pissy when no one liked chicken salad. Then got even more pissy when no one liked tuna. Sent an unprofessional email out and was asked to resign. Got pizza instead. ",

        "text": "Buckle up, this is a long one.\n\nSo I work as a water operator for a small municipality, I have 1500 water taps to homes and businesses and roughly 5000 people that get water from my system. I've done my job for 3 years and if you ask any water operator, they will have a story just like this or worse.\n\nSo it all starts with our customer, (let's call him DL). It was winter 2015, and DL's service line going to his house goes under a state road. Frost goes much deeper on uncovered areas, especially roads. DL's line freezes. So DL calls us and we come to thaw the line (this was probably our 5th customer of the year to have this happen).  We tell him to run water and we take his metering device off so he can run It and not worry about overage. Cut to 3 days later....\n\n3 days later DL calls me and says his water froze again, I asked if he was running water (already knowing the answer).  He says he has. Last I checked running water will never ever freeze unless it's ungodly cold but DL claims it has.  Okay.  We thaw it again and this time it sticks.  So we talk to DL and decide to put a new tap and pit in for him on a street above him ($1500) for free. All he has to do is put a new service in (120ft) and he will never worry about freezing AND have loads of pressure he didn't have on his ancient line. He says sure he will get right on it.\n\nWe put the new stuff in for DL  in May and watch his place til mid August and we see he has not put his new line in. So I give our solicitor a call to see if we can get things rolling. Solicitor writes up an unofficial notice saying DL has until the end of September to put his line in. I guess DL didn't like this because he comes to a monthly meeting our company has (open to the public) to dispute his line being shut off. His reasoning is that he pays for his water, it can't be shut off. Well it can be when you agree to put new stuff in and also get a 1500 tap for free.  DL's case wasn't helped when he came to the meeting drunk as a skunk and carrying a gun on his hip. He was shut down and kicked out and it felt great.\n\nSo our board gives DL until Oct. 31 to get his line in.  He gets an official  notice by registered mail (you have to sign for it or else it comes back to us) saying he has until November 1st to put his line in or the water will be shut off. The big day comes and no new line is put in. So I shut DL's water off like I would anyone who didn't pay their bill. DL stops by our office screaming about his water being off. When asked if he read the notice he says he never got it. Our secretaries tell him they can't do anything and DL leaves.  Looking at the security cameras we have, you can clearly see our notice sticking out of his pocket. (Keep in mind he has to sign for this notice to be delivered and we never got it back).\n\n A few days go by and I get a feeling he turned his water back on.  Sure enough, we check and DL has turned himself on.  \n\nI upgrade and use a lockout tool, basically it's 2 plastic plates with rubber in the middle. When it is screwed down the rubber expands and seals the curb box you turn the water on from.  I put this in the pipe after shutting the water off.  The next day I stop by and see DL broke our lockout tool, and turned himself back on and put the tool in there as if I wouldn't notice. So I go from a 1 in my fighting scale to a 100. I get my crew to come together, and we stake out his house.\n\n Once DL leaves for work we strike.  We dig up his line across the state road and unhook it from the main.  But, me being the vindictive prick I am, that's not the end. I hook a chain to the backhoe we are using and pull his 25 ft copper line out from under the road and leave It in his driveway. I go to our district court house and also have him fined almost 300$ for turning himself on illegally and rendering a 'theft of service' against him. \n\nGood luck turning your water on now asshole.\n\n1 week later DL  has his line in and to this day will not look at me because he knows he was in the wrong and it never had to escalate to that.\n\n\nTLDR:  customers water froze, gave him a free $1500 water tap and a whole summer to do it. He doesn't and when we shut his water off he turns it on again. I escalate the issue and rip his line out of the ground so he can't turn himself on.  I win.",

Most content to sit in my corner, typing furiously at my keyboard and ignoring People. \n\nThrough some underhanded political shenanigans (and outright blackmail) my current boss, who was amazing, was forced to give me over to $Boss to work tech support. \n\nBecause I kicked and screamed all the way, company policy dictated that I *must* accept the transfer, but would be rewarded with a hefty raise in pay. No one in the company saw any problem at all with a code geek doing tech support. Same thing, right?\n\nNow I'm working in a position I am not trained for, but I'm making much more money than my co-workers. My direct supervisor ($DS), whom I liked, reported to $Boss. \n\nWhen the time came to hire a new tech, $DS managed it as a team enterprise, as we would all have to work with the new hire. $DS settled on $CTG. I vehemently protested this (important later). There were red flags in his resume (which $CGT later confessed he paid Big Bucks to have professionally done), and he had an slimy  personality. \n\nShortly after hiring $CTG, $DS moved on to another company. I was offered the responsibilities of $DS without the title, of course, but with another small bump in pay. Since I knew that the company had no intention of filling this vacant position, therefore I would become the de facto lead anyway (as the highest earner), I agreed. \n\nThat's how I became supervisor in a field where I had little training, and no desire to work long term. Important to note, too, that I wasn't a People person. I liked Silly Users well enough, as they didn't know any better. I was not tolerant of people on my team who didn't pull their weight. As in, I was apt to rain hellfire down on those who did Stupid Things. \n\n**The Last Straw**\n\nBy this time, things are not good between $Me and $CTG. \n\nEvery time I take a complaint about $CTG to $Boss, the conversation goes something like this:\n\n&gt;$Me: $CTG has screwed up...\n\n&gt;$Boss: You need to train him. After all, you were part of the team that hired him, so there must be something there you liked. \n\n&gt;$Me: (frustrated) I've tried. It's not working. \n\n&gt;$Boss: Well, document everything. Each time you train him. Each time he makes a mistake. We need a paper trail before we can consider changing his job. \n\nI am now documenting everything. I am talking to HR about things I can do to give him some additional training. I am giving him formal written reprimands for his screwups. Which he does not like at all, and often ends with him screaming at me. \n\n$CTG is definitely feeling the pressure. It's so bad that every time $CTG gets close to the firing line, he files a Workers Comp claim. This takes the pressure off. Legal and HR won't fire someone as long as the claim is open. I won't list the types of claims $CTG filed because they are so utterly ridiculous that no one else in the history of the world could have possibly filed similar claims. \n\nWhen $CTG's last claim is finally resolved, he immediately opens a complaint of Sexual Harassment and Hostile Workforce Environment, targeted at...guess who? Yep. $Me. \n\nI am not supposed to know about this, but you know how workplaces are. It didn't take me long to find out. I'm beginning to worry about my future employment...and the stain this might leave on my resume. \n\nI am told that (1) I cannot raise my voice to $CTG and (2) I cannot, under any circumstances, talk to HR about $CTG any longer. Any concerns I have, I must report directly to $Boss. \n\nOne day, $CTG does something so outrageous that I lose my shit. I raise my voice. About 3 words in...I caught myself and shut my mouth. Then I just turned on my heel and walked into $Boss' office. I report what I did. \n\nThen I go get a lawyer. I'm sweating bullets. The *only* saving grace in this is that no one else saw this incident. So it's my word against his, but I'm not gonna lie. I raised my voice. My lawyer says this is not a big deal. He explains my rights to me. Tells me to be cool and let it all blow over. \n\n$Boss finds out I'm talking to a lawyer about this BS. $Boss reports this to HR. HR and Legal lose their cool because I'm not supposed to know about this investigation. \n\nI am summoned to HR, where I am ambushed by Legal and spend a grueling 2 hours under questioning. Honestly, guys, if I hadn't talked to a lawyer beforehand and therefore, knew exactly what I was required/not required to answer, I think I would have been toast. Burnt toast. \n\n**The Outcome**\n\nA week or two later, I am called into Legal again. They want to talk about my recent interactions with $CTG. I think they want to talk about the day I raised my voice, but that's not it. They are trying to get me to talk about $CTG and something that supposedly happened, but I don't have a clue. \n\nThey ask me to recount all the recent personal conversations I've had with $CTG. This isn't hard because there aren't many. I'm trying not to say anything to $CTG that isn't strictly work-related. I'm trying not to be alone with him, either. \n\nThe only thing that sticks out in my mind is this creepy, kinda veiled threat I got from him. One random day, he walks up to my desk. \n\n&gt;$CTG: That's a nice house you live in. \n\n&gt;$Me: What??\n\n&gt;$CTG: Yeah, you're living over in co-worker's neighborhood. \n\n&gt;$ME: What??\n\n&gt;$CTG: I helped him move last weekend. You know he's living right down the street from you?\n\n&gt;$Me: What makes you think that's my house?\n\n&gt;$CTG: Because your car was parked in the driveway. You know, that (goes on to describe my vehicle in great detail). \n\nThen after that conversation and before I was summoned to Legal, someone egged my car. While it was sitting in my driveway. I live in a fairly nice neighborhood, but things like this happen now and again. Usually though, it's random kids driving through on a Saturday night and throwing eggs from moving cars. This time, no one else got hit and mine wasn't in the street. It was in my driveway. So, I'm a little freaked out...\n\nAfter I recount the creepy conversation to Legal, I reluctantly mention the egging. But I say, there's no proof of anything and I'm not accusing anyone of anything. \n\nI don't want to give them *anything* to say I'm lying or being vindictive or biased. I'm thinking this will backfire on me. \n\nMuch to my surprise, Legal gets visibly upset. Abruptly terminates the meeting. \n\nA couple of days later, I get called into $Boss' office. it's about 3 in the afternoon. \n\n&gt;$Boss: At 4pm, two armed LEOs will be here to escort $CTG out of the office. As soon as they arrive, I want you to lock him out of the network.\n\n&gt;$Me: Wha....?\n\n&gt;$Boss: Don't say anything to him. Don't even look at him. Don't say a word to anyone else. \n\n&gt;$Me: Okay. \n\n&gt;$Boss: Go to you office. No matter what happens, don't leave your desk. We are hoping this goes smoothly, but we don't know what he will do. \n\nI go sit in my office. At 4pm two policemen walk down the hall. They collect $CTG and escort him out. I never saw him again. \n",

        "text": "Long time lurker, forgive my formatting, blahblahblah.  \n\n\nAt the time of this story, I worked as a warehouse supervisor for an office supply chain in Canada.  I was given pretty broad range to run the warehouse as I saw fit.  During my interview, the GM asked me three questions, one of which was, \"If a driver is giving you problems, do you have an issue telling them to eff-off?\"  So, that should give you an indication as to what I was allowed to do.  Also relevant to the story is that my co-worker in this warehouse was a 5-foot-nothing, 100 pound soaking wet girl.  She was the definition of a firecracker when you pissed her off, but otherwise super sweet (her and I become very close friends and I'm highly protective of her in the same way someone might be of their little sister.)\n\n\nNow, since my co-worker was an attractive girl in an industry dominated mostly by sweaty, hairy, gross truck drivers, she would usually get some unwanted attention by these guys.  She usually managed to take it in stride.  That said, within a couple years, we managed to get about half a dozen drivers either taken off our route or even fired (one guy had even managed to track her down off hours to the townhouse complex she rented at, though thankfully never managed to figure out which particular unit, just as an example.)  However, one story still sticks out with me.\n\n\nA particular courier company we dealt with would deliver their freight shipments on a separate truck.  This driver was the absolute definition of Redneck trucker.  Pot belly, half bald, always sweaty and smelly, bragged about taking his mom to a mud wrestling competition for Mother's Day one year (and no, I never asked if his mom was the one wrestling or not... didn't want to know).  Y'know, that sort.  He always made passes to my co-worker but every time she made it clear to him that she wasn't interested in the least.  Anyway, one day I get a call from my brother.  He also worked in a warehouse for a well known automotive performance company about twenty minutes down the road from my store.  M=me, B=bro\n\n&gt;B: \"So I just had a very... interesting conversation with a driver about [your co-worker.]  I'll give you three guesses who I'm talking about.\"\n\n\n&gt;M: \"(gives first name that pops to mind)\"\n\n\n&gt;B: \"That's him.  He was just talking about what he would love to do with her[bro goes into specifics that I'll keep out of here, though I'm sure your imagination is probably correct], but said she must be a lesbo.  She keeps rejecting him and instead insists on hanging out with some [homophobic slur] she works with.  I kept my mouth shut but wanted to give you the heads up to do as you see fit.  He said he's on the way to drop off a shipment to [my company] and wanted some time to look at her so he'll have something to keep him warm tonight.\"\n\n\nConversation goes on for a couple more minutes before I thank him and hang up.  At this point I'm seething - I'm seeing red.  I'm a very easy going guy and am almost impossible to bring to anger, but this had me going.  By now my co-worker comes back into the warehouse after helping a customer and sees me blowing smoke out of my ears.  As I go to answer her, I see the expected courier truck backing into my loading dock.  I tell her to go for a break, that I have this truck and don't worry about it just yet.  She leaves, confused.  I also give my manager a quick call, saying something along the lines of \"I might get fired for what I'm about to do, but trust me - it's completely justified.\"  She's also confused but says she trust me and to keep her updated.\n\n\nAnyway, buzzer rings, I open the man door and let the driver in.  He's obviously looking around the loading area for my co-worker while trying to hand me the waybill slips.  I've manage to cool my head slightly and decided to try something with the guy.  D= driver.\n\n\n&gt;M: \"She's not here right now, she's on break.\"\n\n\n&gt;D: \"Oh, that's too bad.\"  (Again, he tries to hand me the paperwork and is looking at the still locked rolling door)\n\n\n&gt;M: \"So I just had an interesting conversation with someone a few minutes ago.\"\n\n\n&gt;D: \"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\n&gt;M: \"Yeah.  Someone from [Well Known Automotive Performance Company] called me, said something about a chat they had with you.\" \n\n\n(that got his attention)\n\n\n&gt;M: \"That guy you were talking to about [co-worker] and saying sh*t about me?  Guess what, that's my little brother...\"\n\n\n(By now, the driver went white and, grossly enough, even more sweaty)\n\n\n&gt;D: \"[incoherent stammering]\"\n\n\n&gt;M: \"I don't want to hear it.  Get the [f-bomb] out of my warehouse, don't ever say that sh*t about [co-worker] or myself again and don't ever come back either here or to [bro's company.]  \n\n\n&gt;D: \"[more incoherent stammering and protestations.]\"\n\n\n&gt;M: \"Get. The. [f-bomb]. Out.  Now.\"\n\n\n(Now, I've got many years of martial arts training under my belt, and my Sensei was also an ex-ERT RCMP officer (Canadian version of SWAT), so I had some pretty thorough training.)  \n\n\nI realized as soon as I uttered that last sentence I had reflexively dropped into a defensive stance.  I'm not a threatening looking guy by any stretch of the imagination but this driver took one look, opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, and all but fled out the door.\n\n\nMy co-worker and manager, having heard the commotion, both came bolting into the warehouse.  I filled them into what had happened, all the while hearing the background noise of this guy's truck doing it's very best to peel out of the loading bay.  Manager tells me she'll back me up no matter what and the co-worker seems a little shell shocked (again, I'm not one to get angry so she had never experienced or heard it before.)  Manager offers to cover the warehouse for a little bit so I can go out for a smoke to calm down.  During that break I give that company a call.  Talk to dispatch first, who patches me over to some supervisor.  He then passes me up to Ops Manager, where I explain the whole situation and give him my brother's work number to verify his part.\n\n\nNever saw that guy on my route again.  Turns out he was the Shop Steward and lost that role.  He also lost a coveted position on the 2010 Olympics sponsorship his company had originally offered him a few days previously.  Then a few days later, after a full investigation had occurred, our regular courier driver (not freight driver) for the same company informed us he had been fired for harassment, unprofessional conduct, and many other things.  Turns out that investigation opened up some unreported issues he had with other companies he dealt with.  I didn't care, though.  He was gone.  No one talks about my [not actually] little sister like that.\n\n\nAnd that's how I gleefully got a driver fired.\n\n\ntl:dr - Courier driver unknowingly talks to my brother about sexually harassing my co-worker.  I get angry, driver gets fired.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for my first gold, Anon Redditor!  I promise I shall use it only for good... unless I otherwise see fit.  :p",

        "text": "I know I just posted, but thinking about Dredds lady (\"Don't get huffy with me.\") brought back more aggravating stories which have riled me up. This is a particularly fun one from my time at another location of the same chain. This is from about three years ago, when I lived in the largest city in my country, and had to spent 3 hours commuting each day. It was particularly horrendous because the cost of a one way bus fare was $5.50, and of course I had to take it twice a day. \n\n$J = Team Leader, M = Me \n\nMy hours were 8.30pm until 4am, and after the shift ended I would walk around half a kilometre on a road notorious for drug dealers and street sex workers. I had to wait until 7am at a petrol station for my bus. I was 16. \n\nOne afternoon $J calls me, knowing I'm sleeping off a shift at this time, to ask me to come in again that night. I say sure. Its a Saturday night, which I've never worked before. \n\nWhen I get in, there are only 3 of us working, myself and $J, and another man who is lovely but I barely knew him. \n\nWhen on break at 10.30pm, $J informs me that tonights shift is only until 12.30am. As I'd never worked Sat or Sun nights before, he knew I was unaware of this. \n\nM: \"Oh.. I didn't know that. Do you know if the buses are still running then?\" \n\n$J shrugs: \"I don't know, I never catch the buses.\"\n\nMe, a little put out, just nods. \n\nWhen 12.30am rolls around, I hurry off down the street and thankfully there are people out because its a social night, so I'm not left to be stalked by homeless again. *This happened multiple times*. \n\nI make it to the bus stop and check the route roster, and the last bus for the night comes in an hour and a half, at 2.00am. I think, okay, I can do that. I make it to the gas station unscathed and sit there for a bit, anxious, because if the bus roster is fucked up, which happens, I'll be stranded for 9 hours. Sunday morning buses don't run until 9.30am... Thank god for 24hr petrol stations..\n\nIt hits 2am and I'm waiting at the bus stop, and alas, the bus never comes. I feel like crying because I'm broke, cold, fatigued, and a myriad of other issues that come with living alone in an expensive city on casual work hours. I wait the 9 hours and my gas station friend gives me a complimentary coffee and chicken nuggets. Thank you, friend. \n\nAt 10am when I'm nearing my house on the bus, $J calls. \n\n$J: \"Hey, can you come in tonight and do the Sunday shift?\"\n\nAt this point I can barely keep my eyes open and I'm shaking from starvation and health problems. \n\nM: \"Uhm.. what hours is it?\"\n\n$J: \"It's 4pm to 12am.\"\n\nM: \"I'm sorry, $J, I'm too tired to come in, and the buses won't get me home until 8am Monday.\"\n\n$J: \"You sounds fairly awake to me, M. If you don't want to take it, just say so. This job isn't compulsory, you know.\"\n\nI started crying, I'll admit. \n\nM: \"I'm on the bus home now. I had to wait 9 hours.\"\n\n$J: \"Oh.. *muffled laughing*, woops, sorry about that. Never mind, I'll see you Monday night?\"\n\nM: \"Yeah, sure..\"\n\nAfter I'd woken up at 7pm that evening, I called my manager, who is a blessing, and she was pissed. She said she'd talk to $J, and although it wouldn't come to anything, he'd be careful to properly take care of employees in the future. As he closes the store after our shift 3 nights a week, he's supposed to make sure we're all okay getting home because of the area we were in. Alas, he never did do that. \n\nOn another occasion, $J told me I should just drive to work, but didn't seem to understand my pay didn't allow enough for food let alone buying a car.. \n\nFuck $J. He never did get promoted. Wonder why. ",

This happened about a month and a half ago. \n\nM- Me, Dredd- Bitchy coworker with ill kept dredlocks. \n\nIt was booming in town, with Christmas two days prior, and I'd worked 7 days straight. It had all been fairly good and I'd actually enjoyed this years xmas, as I was on checkouts this time. I had a line of around 9 carts, and they were all packed full so we weren't moving too quickly. \n\nDredd comes over and I smile in greeting as I'm scanning something. \n\nDredd: \"Why did you discount a $10 pack of 4 underwear to $1.98?\" \n\nNo hello or anything. Never spoken to her even though we know each others names. It's not that big of a store, around 30 employees total. \n\nM: \"I... didn't?\" Already I started getting my back up from the tone in her voice. I wasn't aware at this point but she was one of the remaining few office bitches who hadn't been fired for their clinquey workplace-harassment. \n\nDredd: \"It says right here you did,\" pointing to the scanner she had. It did in fact say that. I realised she was doing stocktake and so she was checking all the purchased discounts because it makes stocktake really hard. \n\nMe: \"I didn't discount a 4 pack. I wouldn't do that, and nobody asked me to change a price like that.\"\n\nDredd purses her lips and looks me up and down, at this point I'm going a little red which is uncommon for me, and I shakily apologise to the customer because its slowing the line down. She nods slowly and looks between us. I wish I'd known what she was thinking. \n\nDredd: \"Ooo-kaaay...\" sighs obnoxiously, \"Supervisor! Can you take over here for a moment?\"\n\nSupervisor comws over, pats me on the back (she's lovely af) and I go to the side with Dredd.\n\nDredd sighs again, as though she has the weight of world on her shoulders, and says: \"Lets try this again, o-kaay? The system doesn't lie. You can't disocunt like that. Why did you do that?\" Tapping the scanner roughly.\n\nI shake my head.

She likely felt entitled to because I'm around 10 years younger than her, but that doesn't fly with me. I had the job because I had the experience. I'm not freshmeat.\n\nM: \"Check the security cameras and come back to me if you're right. The only way that happened is if the underwear, one pair from the discounted bin, rang up as $10. I changed a single pairs price beause that isn't what the price tag said. I'm going on break.\"\n\nDredd muttered something like 'bitch' as I walked off, visible upset, and went upstairs to the break room. From there you can see most of the store, and subsequently I looked down from right above the security desk, to watch her request the clip from security dude, a good friend of mine. After a minute or two she walked off and never sought me out. \n\nI went downstairs and outside for a smoke, and when I was out there, I saw the stores general manager. I told him what happened and he didn't look pleased. He's a really great guy, but I didn't expect him to take me seriously because I'd only worked at this location for the chain, for about 3 months. For undisclosed reasons, Dredds was fired two weeks later. \n\nFuck you, Dredds, I hope spiders lay a nest in your shitty hair.",

He uses this excuse whenever anyone questions his actions. Wonderful things like buying a generator, used and without warranty from a private seller, and then finding out the motor had been painted to cover cracks and leaks, and it was missing all electrical cords. Another time, he bought a replacement for a piece of out-dated equipment, bought from certified suppliers, but ignored workers who told him it wouldn't fit in the door. (Later it was returned because it was cheaper to pay the penalty than it was to tear a hole in the wall for a bigger door.) \n\nThe latest one is a memo issued to employees, after one of his workers went to corporate HR and ask if they were going to be recognized for a safety milestone. Suddenly, he jumps into action!\n\n&gt; Team, We achieved 2 yrs Incident Free on Jan4/2017. This is a great milestone for everyone in the department. We are working on plans for a celebration. See your supervisor to put in your idea on how to celebrate...of course there are some guidelines:\n\n&gt; Cannot involve the purchase of gift Cards as these purchases are not sanctioned by our accounting department\n\n&gt;Value of the good needs to be max $120 and cannot be cash, ie must be a purchased good like a Jacket or cooler etc.\n\n&gt;Keep in mind a good and a celebration ie Purchase of a new winter jacket(4 styles to choose from) and a breakfast celebration cooked by the mgt team.\n\n&gt;Must include everyone, that is if you have the recommendation to fly everyone to Mexico, that is we likely could only send 2 people and most others would not give up their reward to another person...sorry :(\n\nYes, that is the memo, (all grammatical and other errors are direct from the memo including the frowny face at the end) written by a man with an MBA, and 20+ years as a manager with this company, a company with facilities around the world. Yes, English is his first language. Not, it was not written by a secretary. \n\n",

        "text": "I was nineteen at the time. Right after our equivalent of high school (I'm Swedish) I got a job at a company - that I now realize was pretty fucking shady - where I was to go door to door selling broadband and telephone contracts. We were only paid if we got a sale. I was really ill that Summer, had a nasty infection of the tonsills that just wouldn't go away. Lost 30 pounds due to my inability to eat, my BMI was at 11,5 and I looked like a fucking skeleton. Still, it was my first job and I powered through.\n\nIt was a learning experience: never learned some companies simply do not give a fuck about their employees, and that I'll never make it as a salesman. Many days I'd come back to the office with no sales, having knocked on over 200 doors.\n\nAnyway, this particular afternoon I rang the bell to a little house in the nicer suburbs of Gothenburg. I had already made two sales, and I was in a *lot* of pain, so I wasn't really planning on giving my a-game.\n\nThe door opens and an overweight, bearded man in his late fifties opens, wearing only his underwear and an open shirt.\n\nA bit wierded out I start giving him my pitch, and he actually looks pretty interested. He invites me inside with a thick Russian accent, and goes to put on some clothes.\n\nAs I step in I'm faced with a huge painted portrait of the guy wearing a full evening dress while holding a glass of wine.\n\n&gt;The fuck?\n\nAfter a long while the guy comes out wearing a suit. \"Ay hosst should nehver by dressed mour poorley than hees gehst,\" he explains (I was wearing my only suit as well, it was standard uniform).\n\nHe invites me into the drawing room (we weren't allowed to enter potential clients' homes, but I was really curious where this was going, so fuck it).\n\nDark leather couches, expensive-looking carpets, classy coffee table, several more paintings of the guy, classical music on the stereo.\n\n&gt;Man, this is how I want to live one day.\n\nWe sit down opposite to each other, and continue going through the motions of the sales pitch. I ask him some questions about his current internet speed and whatnot. He stops me.\n\n\"Teyll me. Hhonestly. Do you theenk dis is soemthink I need?\"\n\n\"Right. To be perfectly honest, maybe. Seems to me that your current broadband is fairly slow and this has a speed of [can't remember. Better and cheaper than what he had, though].\"\n\n\"Fayn. I trahst you. I do noht trahst many sehlspeehple, bat yoo. Yoo seem 'oonest.\"\n\nI give him the contract to sign and he instantly turns a door and shouts something in Russian. I almost shit myself, but after a few moments a very tiny woman comes out, puts a bottle of cognac and two glasses on on the table before scurrying off.\n\n\"Ees wayf.\"\n\nHe pours a pretty damn good amount into booth glasses.\n\n\"Drink.\"\n\n\"I'm- I'm not allowed to drink on the job.\"\n\n\"Noonsens. Both drink beefohr I sign. Eeht's Rahssian way.\"\n\nHe downs it. I do the same. Then he signs.\n\nThen he starts telling me his life's story. Turns out he used to work in the Soviet Union as a youth. He was scraping the rust off of old submarines at this massive complex. He loved singing and would sing Russian folk songs to his co-workers during lunch break. They all thought he was awesome and encouraged him to take up singing as a profession. Unfortunately that was virtually impossible in the USSR, so he left the country illegally, ended up in West Germany and sang for various jazz bands. Then he somehow got to Sweden, worked a lot of shitty jobs before auditioning for the Gothenburg Opera. Got employed there as a tenor, and has been singing for the opera ever since.\n\nAt the conclusion of his story he filled both glasses again.\n\n\"Drink. I wehll sink for you.\"\n\n\"I don't...\"\n\n\"Drink! Will gehv you flesh. Yoo are jahst skin and bohn.\"\n\nI oblige, and he stands up and delivers this fucking amazing performance. I've never found out what it was, but it was in Russian and sounded like a traditional song.\n\nI'm blown away. He sits down again and fills up the glasses.\n\n\"I don't think I should...\"\n\n\"Een Rahssia we zay: Wan drink for yor lehft leg. Wan drink for yor right leg. Ahnd wan drink for yor hehd. Drink.\"\n\nI drank. Shortly thereafter I took my good byes of this awesome man and stepped out on the street again, pretty wobbly.\n\nIt was a shitty job, but it was worth it solely for that experience.\n\n**Epilogue:** Several years later I was in the foyer at the Gothenburg Opera, and I ran into him again. \n\n\"Aah, the boi who couldn't kehp hee's drink,\" he laughed and bought me a glass of wine at the bar.\n\n**Edit:** [This](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaj_Giljov) is his Wikipedia page (only in Swedish, but still). Given the many grammatical errors I assume he wrote it himself.",

Apparently $VP doesn't use that feature when scheduling meetings.\n\nI reply to all:\n\n&gt; If this is the best time for everyone I can do it, but I normally take lunch at 1.  Can we move this an hour earlier or later?\n\n$VP is the type of person who doesn't respond to emails or instant messages.

I wait a few hours for a response, get none, and just accept the meeting invite, admitting defeat.\n\n----\n\nAround 12:45 today my Outlook reminder pops up, telling me I have that meeting with $VP, $NewHire, and $Coworker in 15 minutes.  Crap.  I forgot to set a reminder to go to lunch early.  I have 15 minutes to eat.  \n\nOpen up my lunch bag and my heart sinks.  Apparently I was distracted when packing lunch this morning.  I took the big cup I usually use for soup, but didn't actually grab any soup.

The desks also have the instructions taped to it.   \n\nthe people involved\nlady: the young lady that finds voting hard\nv1: volunteer that has no wand. \nv2: volunteer that has a wand.\n\n*Lady: ~yells out~ So I filled out my page! What's next?*  \nv1: ~walks over and stands so that the covered desk is between the lady and v1~ Please read all of the instructions.   \n*Lady: I did! See look!* ~Pulls out her voting page and holds up to v1's face.~   \nv1: No you didn't. If you did, then you would know that you filled that out incorrectly. You only mark one box for each category. You do not mark all the boxes and leave one box not marked. Please read the instructions while I get you a new ballot. ~He takes the ballot and rips it up~    \nv1: Here is your ballot. Please just mark one box for each category, hide your ballot in the folder and then bring it to the machine over there to scan your vote.   \n*Lady: So I circle the name that I want?*   \nv1: No. Look you fill one of these boxes. You see this line? That is one category. So you can only fill one box for this category because these rules say so. But on this category, you can mark multiple boxes because these rules say so. Do you understand?  \n*Lady: oh! I didn't see those rules! Thank you so much.*  \n\nThe lady fills out her ballot and walks over to the machine. when her time comes, she turns to v2 and asks...  \n\n*Lady: So what now?*  \nv2: ~while sitting down, uses wand to point at instructions on the machine~  \n*Lady: I read it! What do I do?*  \nv2: Just put your ballot into the slot and give me the folder and your done.  \n*Lady:* ~She tries to put the folder with the ballot into the slot.~  \nv2: ~Gets up and takes the folder from her when she is unable to fit the folder into the slot. V2 opens the folder and says, \"Take your ballot and put it into the machine\"  \n*Lady: Oh. I'm sorry* ~She follows instructions and leaves.   \nv2: ~looks at me and notices my \"WTF\" expression~ We have seen a lot of that every time it comes to vote. It's like some people just turn off their brains when it comes time to vote.   ",

        "text": "&gt;I'm an apartment manager and I had a studio on the market. It took  2 days to spruce the place up and 2 weeks before I got someone to rent it. We use a variety of online listings and of course get calls from real estate that found my ad online. Now I probably should use a separate free phone number for this sort of thing but my Boss is a bit leery of that. I got a call from one person who found it online.   \nI'm also going to do my best to anonymize everything.  \n\n**Chicago**:*Hello!*    \nme: Hi.   \n**Chicago**:*On craiglist, I see that there is studio in [a county of NYC] for $XXX. Is it still available?*  \nme:Yes it is and here is some details.... [details]. Do you have questions?  \n**Chicago**:*Yes. I'm currently living in Chicago and I just got a job in NYC working for [a famous group of classical musicans]. So I won't be able to show any current pay stubs, is that a problem?*  \nme: No. I'm sure you get something from your new employer that clearly shows that you are now working for them, a phone number and other details of your employment.   \n**Chicago**:*Yeah! I already got that. That is relief. Some of the people I talked to was very negative about this. So can I give you a deposit now for the place?*  \nme: No. You need to come here and tour the place and take an application if you are still interested. The application fee is not a deposit. It mainly exists to stop people from wasting my time and money by giving away applications that I will never see again and need to replace. The fee is for the use of the application. It's also nonrefundable.   \n**Chicago**:*Application. So that means I may not get the studio if I apply.*   \nme: That is true. When you submit the application with copies of any of all proofs of ID and income listed within the application, that gets sent to an investigator. The investigator makes sure everything is true, gets some more info and hands it off to my Boss who decides which application will get the studio.     \n**Chicago**:*This sounds way too complicated. Do you have any other photos of the place that I can view? I can give you four months in advance if we could skip the process.*   \nme: I don't have any other photos than what is on the ad. My Boss still requires potential tenants to view the place in person and go through the application process. We also only take 1st month's rent + security deposit + prorated fee. Nothing more than that and only after an applicant goes through the process and is accepted by my Boss to get the apartment.   \n**Chicago**:*Can I make an appointment for this Saturday then?*      \nme: I am available to show the studio any day from 9AM to 8PM but you need to call me in the morning of that day your coming to see if it's still available.   \n**Chicago**:*That's only 4 days from now. You don't truly expect the studio to go that fast with the complicated process you are following?*    \nme: I can't see the future. You can call me in the morning on the day that you are coming if you would like to come see the place.      \n**Chicago**:*Okay. Goodbye.*   \nme: Bye.   \n\n&gt;So after four days I hand out eighteen applications and receive nothing back. Though I get one couple that returned with a blank application and asked for their money back. I gave it back because I got the blank application back. I ain't a miser. Chicago calls me the morning and tells me that he is on his way but won't be able to see the place until Sunday morning. I tell him to call me again on Sunday.  So Sunday comes and I still don't have any applications. I'm wondering why people like giving their money away when he call me at 8AM to tell me he is standing outside the building and it's a bit chilly out here. \n\nme: I told you before that I'm available from 9AM to 8PM. I still have to get cleaned up and drive over there.   \n**Chicago**:*Oh! No problem. My time is quite precious and I have a few other places I can go see in the meantime.*   \nme: Okay. I'll see you at 9AM.   \n\n&gt;At 9AM, I show up and take him inside to look at the place. He looks it over, asks if the rent is negotiable before asking for an application. I tell him that it's not and remind him of the application fee and the application process. I show him the application before he pulls out his money and go over it. I do this because I remembered our conversation four days ago, so I am a bit apprehensive now that he wants to negotiate rent price when he was so willing to hand me four months in advance previously. I assume he probably found a better place or better rent elsewhere.  \n\n**Chicago**:*So here is the money and I here is my ID and let me fill out this application.*   \nme: I need a copy of your ID, copys of your documentation and this filled out application. Unfortunately you can't fill it out here since you are not renting this space. Also I don't have a copy machine at this building. So please come back when you have everything.   \n**Chicago**:*This is an apartment building right?*     \nme: Yes.   \n**Chicago**:*You don't have an office here or nearby that will let me do this?*  \nme: Unfortunately not.   \n**Chicago**:*Look, I got lots of places to look at throughout NYC today. I don't have time to copy my information and fill every application and drop it off.*    \nme: I'm sorry but I can't help you. If you are not interested in the studio then we can reverse this transaction now.   \n**Chicago**:*Oh no! I'm very much interested in this studio. It's perfect for me. It's just that my time is precious, I'll be here in NYC for a few days before I have to go back to Chicago. I just hoping to get the process started as soon as possible.*  \nme: I can't help you. Sorry.    \n**Chicago**:*Could I use the bathroom first before I leave.*  \nme: No.   \n**Chicago**:*Why not?*    \nme: I don't have an available public bathroom.     \n**Chicago**:*No. This bathroom in this studio.*  \nme: Is not a public bathroom. The only person or persons that can use it, is the ones that rent this studio.    \n**Chicago**:*Oh. Well I'll see you later then.*     \n\n&gt;He comes back in a hour with the application and copies of his documents. He asks me how many other people applied and how long an investigation process may take. I tell him that it could take a few hours to a day and seventeen people applied but he is the first to return an application.   \n\n**Chicago**:*A few hours to a day? My time is very precious to me. I can't wait around all day outside your building. I have other apartments to look at after all.*   \nme: I'm not the investigator or my Boss who decides who gets this apartment.   \n**Chicago**:*So you are just an real estate agent.*  \nme: No I work for the owner of this property directly. I have an investigator on call that does his job and then hands it off to the Boss. You don't need to hang around since I have no clue how long this investigation may take. You can go look at the other places that you have mentioned.   \n**Chicago**:*Yes. I will do that. I'll hopefully hear from you before I leave for Chicago today.*   \n\n&gt;He leaves. I hand off the stuff to my guy while I show off the place to a lot more people that show up to see the place. I get a call two hours later from the applicant. \n\n**Chicago**:*So.... any progress?*  \nme: I'm not the investigator. You will get a call from me today or tomorrow on whether or not you got the place or you are rejected.   \n**Chicago**:*Well my time is precious and those are my only copies so I'm going to wait here for awhile.*   \nme: okay. Bye. \n\n&gt;He gave me originals instead of copies of his documents. Either this guy is absent minded or he was too cheap to make a copy of his documents when he made a copy of his ID. And this is guy that wanted to give me four months in advance. He calls me back twenty minutes later asking for his documents back since he can't wait around any longer. I tell him that I handed it to my investigator, who doesn't work at the apartment building. It will take me an hour to get his stuff back. He says that's fine. I hand back his documents minus the application in front of the building. It's windy and cold that day. I wish I remembered to wear my cap.\n\n**Chicago**:*Where is the application?*    \nme: As I told you when we were going over the application process, the fee is for the use of the application. The application is still ours. That gets shredded. And if you had handed me copies of your documentation then those copies would have got shredded too.   \n**Chicago**:*oh. Can I have the application fee back too?*   \nme: That is non-refundable. That is only clearly marked in the listing and the application that you filled out and signed that you understood the application process.    \n**Chicago**:*Oh yeah. Well could I use the bathroom?*    \nme: No.       \n**Chicago**:*It will only be for a second. My time is really precious and I need to head over to the next apartment.*     \nme: I do not have the power to let you use that bathroom. Perhaps the next place you go to will have a public bathroom.     \n**Chicago**:*I have some money. I really need to use the bathroom. How much?*    \nme: No. I have to go. It's way too cold out here. Bye.     \n\n&gt;I head to my car and leave. My super tells me that chicago stood there for a few minutes. Then walked away. He called me back 2 weeks and four days later asking if the studio was still available and if he could apply for it. He expressed his disbelief that the studio was off the market and even more disbelief that I had no other empty apartments. \n\n[edit] I edited it to make it easier to read. It took a few tries. Sorry.",

Since working at my new location I have quit one job and kept the other, at a retro video game store. I only work a few hours a week there so lately I have been trying to make it exciting. My most recent shenanigan was playing the 10hr \"What's going on\" He-Man version as long as I could tolerate it. By hour 1 at least 4 people had asked what I was listening to. Around hour 3 is where it got truly funny. A woman had been looking through our DVD section for upwards of an hour. Occasionally I hear her sing some of the lyrics then curse under her breath, as if she is upset at herself. When she finally checked out she says \"Isn't it maddening?\" I say \"Yes, and I had it on 2 hours before you got here.\" I then do my best impression of the Jokers laugh and she promptly left the store. Crazy thing is, people now come to the store when I am there because it lightens the mood and loosens people up to get a laugh. \n\nTL,DR: I don't need this job so I do whatever I want and it has helped business.",

We're not just talking fixing minor problems here, this woman goes all out. She makes an okay living doing it, it brings her happiness (and she has never been a happy person), so whatever, good for her. She's always been a craft person, so I know doing something she actually likes means a lot to her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe uses the usual sites and apps to sell her items. What pisses her off most is people having constant contact, saying “Yeah, I want it, I'll give you a time and date when I can pick it up soon”, replies two days later with a date and time, and then they don't show up at that date and time. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe most frustrating time this happened, the lady said she'd come the next day at 10:00am. The next day comes, my mom messages her to verify, she doesn't respond. 10:00am comes and goes, nothing. My mom messaged her around noon and said “If you don't want it, just say so. If you do not get back to me by 6:00pm tonight, I will put the listing back up. Thanks.” The lady gets back to her at 5:55pm, says yes she still wants, can she come get it the next day at 9:00am. My mom tells her “okay, are you sure 9:00am is okay for you? I can do as late as 11:00am.” The woman responds saying 9:00am is perfect, though she might not be there until 9:30am, depending on traffic. My mom says 9:30am would be fine, just once again, no later than 11:00am.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe next morning, a Saturday, at 6:00am, the woman calls, waking my mom up. My mom answers and the lady says she's in the driveway. My mom, still half asleep, was like “What? You told me 9:00-9:30” The woman responds “I'm early, can we make this quick?” My mom wakes up my dad, who has to help load, and starts literally praying that she won't hurt somebody all the way down the steps. When my mom got outside, she was trying so hard to not lose it on this poor woman, but made some comments such as: “Would you appreciate if I told you 9am and showed up at your house at 6am?” “I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.” “The sun's not even out” “Church doesn't even start this early” and then starts half whispering the lord's prayer, lmao.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy mom texted her and apologized later (she fancies herself as a decent Christian woman) but now when she makes sales, she says in her messages “No earlier than X time”.

It was an easy gig, except that you occasionally would have a puker. The first, and thankfully, only time, I had to take care of cleaning vomited up nachos and cotton candy was quite memorable.\n\n   I closed the ride (duh) and found the manager on duty, who was the most stereotypical Motorcycle riding, Marlboro red smoking carny of a guy you can imagine. His instructions to me were as follows: \"Grab a bucket. Go to the fountain in the middle of the park. Fill it up, and dump the water on the puke. Then run the ride.\" \n\n   This seemed like a very ineffective way to clean up vomit, but I did as he said...because, girl, I EARNED that 6.25 an hour. I soon found that the ride slightly titled downwards causing the water to pool in the center of the boat. I also learned, once I began to run the ride, that there was a small hole in the middle of the boat. (I'm assuming to act as a drain when it rained)\n\n   I got to watch in horror as people on the scrambler next to us had the slow realization that they were being showered with puke water.\n\nI was thankful to never have to work that ride again, and even more thankful to get to leave it when the summer ended.",

        "text": "I work in the kitchen of an assisted living home with about 60 residents of all ages and walks of life. There's a guy here, we'll call him John, who has multiple personalities and suffers from a partially acid induced Schizophrenic nightmare.\n\nJohn's backstory; He had multiple identities and hails from a rich family. He bought a LOT of acid and took it all. When his parents came to check on him in the fancy house they bought him, he had the windows barred and tried to kill them. He never came back from his trip and has been living in this acid induced nightmare for over 20 years and has been deemed \"schizophrenic\". One of his \"protectorate\" identities is \"Dad\". Whenever John is threatened, John's \"Dad\" will tell John how to handle the situation. Anytime that John leaves the facility, \"Dad\" takes over. John, to this day, believes that his \"Dad\" buys his smokes. Overall, I'm told that John is only 25% John. The rest is taken over by his other identities, of whom I'm not aware of meeting any.\n\nHere's my story;\n\nI was warned a lot that John would try to intimidate me as I was new. Over the first couple of months, I never, EVER had any problems with John. He always said hello to me. None of his other identities showed up, that is, until one day. I came to work and I wasn't exactly having the best of days, which for me, is rare. I'm always really nice to all of the residents. So, I went about my job, filling their water, getting juices, filling coffee without my usual smile. At one point or another, I remember looking up at John and I suppose if I were John, I could see how it was like a scowl more than anything. \n\nSo, about 5 minutes go by and he gets up suddenly and leaves. About 20 minutes later, John comes walking around the corner and says to me, \"My dad wants to talk to you\". At that point, I wasn't really sure how to react because I knew he meant his protectorate. So, I said, \"Alright, John. I'll talk to your dad, but I need to finish what I'm doing, first\". He looked at me for a second with a weird, almost empty-eyed expression before snapping back to John, full of life and said, \"Have a good day\", and scurried away. I really didn't think much of it then, so I just kept on working.\n\nLater on, when I was serving his table next to him, he said something really quietly. I stopped what I was doing to avoid angering him anymore and went closer. When I was within ear-shot, I asked him, \"What'd you say, John? I couldn't hear you.\" and he yelled, \"You need to erase the attack you did to me\"! I was surprised, so I gave him a really confused look trying to figure out what he meant by attack. Before I could say anything, he said it again; \"You need to erase the attack you did to me. My dad told me I could tell you that\". At that point I knew that it was the scowl. It HAD to be scowl because I've never so much come within 3 feet of John, let alone attack him. I said, \"I'm sorry, John. I didn't mean to attack you. I erase the attack,\" and his aggression disappeared instantly. \n\nBefore I left work that day, I went to go smoke in the courtyard. I was finally having a better day. I was ready to go home. And then a friend of mine starts texting me about this petty drama that I was SO not in the mood for. As I was angry-reading her message to me, John comes walking out to have a cigarette. I didn't notice him at first, but I finally look up and he says, \"You know. Your friend is the one that likes me. You treat me like shit!\" And that... That was when I realized what was happening. John is so used to having other identities that he believes that it's normal for everyone to have them. He assumed that my bad mood was another identity of mine and \"my friend\" was my normal, peppy and cheery self. So I said to him, \"I don't treat you like--\". He walked away. He wasn't having it. So, I got up, and I went home.\n\nSince then, I always make sure to smile at him and make sure to avoid looking at him if I'm having a bad day. Since that day, he hasn't come to me about talking to his dad or treating him like shit. So, I guess I have my recipe for a Happy John. I just thought this would be a story worth sharing. I'm thinking about doing a series of stories like this one from other residents because there are a lot! Tell me what you think.\n\n\nTL;DR - John has lots of identities and drug induced schizophrenia. His \"Dad\" personality wanted to talk to me. Told me I \"Needed to erase the attack\" I didn't do to him (I accidentally scowled at him in a bad mood). Then told me I treated him like shit because he thought my bad mood was like one of his identities, someone different, based on how I was acting. Thought it was interesting &amp; worth sharing. Want me to do more? Let me know.",

For those who don't know what a CNA is,it's a Certified Nursing Assistant and what that means is I work at a nursing home and take care of those who stay there and call it their home. Well I work night shift and don't let anyone tell you night shift is dead silent. I was working one night and noticed a call light was hit which means someone needed assistance. I head over and see my residents with some kind of cream on his...nether area and black gloves which our building does not even have. I stare for a second and ask the gentleman what is the problem and he informs me that his privates were burning something bad. I see a bottle of Nair on his nightstand and sigh for those who do not know what Nair is a hair removal lotion which is NOT supposed to be near your privates because it basically burns the hair right off with the chemicals. So here I am not knowing what to do because I never thought something like this would happen. I go and get the nurse and she says the only thing I can do is clean it with cold water and see if I can get as much of it all off as possible. I proceed to clean it up while my resident is screaming bloody murder,angry at me for using a cold rag to clean up the area that is burning. I explain that the only reason it would be burning is because he might have extreme skin irritation and I was not planning on using hot water to clean the area and proceeded telling him I was almost done and I am sorry for the pain. Needless to say some of the skin on his..for a lack of better words balls of fire had been damaged and he was bleeding slightly. After about an hour of me icing and reducing the bleeding to a stop he thanked me after and told me sorry repeatedly for his actions. \nI do in fact love my job because it has never been a boring night since I got hired.",

I work primarily as a server, but, like food service goes, I end up doing a lot more cleaning and organizing than anything else. On the off chance that I'm actually out front interacting with customers, I always have a great time.\n\nToday however, was not that day.\n\nWe allow you to call and place orders for take out, and, it being football season, that's usually the anticipated way people will order their food. I was managing the phones, and I got a call from a man who we will call Robbie.\n\nMe: \"Hello, (store's name and location), what sounds good today?\"\n\nRobbie: \"What? Excuse me?\"\n\nM: \"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you placing an order for take out?\"\n\nR: \"I am.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, sweet. What can I get started for you?\"\n\nR: \"One hamburger with lettuce and pickles.\"\n\nMe: *uh, okay, our burger already COMES with those.* \"Do you *just* want lettuce and pickles on that burger?\"\n\nR: \"No. I want cheese too.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh. okay.\" *voids his original hamburger option and makes it a cheeseburger.* \"So a cheeseburger with lettuce and pickles only?\"\n\nR: \"NO. I want it with everything, but make sure that pickles and lettuce are on it.\"\n\nMe: *What the fuck.* \"Okay! Awesome, that comes with mustard, mayo, onions, and tomatoes as well! Those are all okay?\"\n\nR: \"If mustard comes on my fucking burger I will lose my fucking mind.\"\n\nThis is the part where I think, *okay, this guy is not all-there. Just make sure it's correct and end the call.*\n\nR: \"Is that fucking clear?\"\n\nMe: \"Yessir. I'll make sure that doesn't end up on your burger. Is that everything?\"\n\nR: \"I'm not DONE.\"\n\nR: *proceeds to order 36 boneless wings with our hottest off-menu sauces, and will not hear me when I mention that will cost a dollar extra.*\n\nMe: \"okay! *proceeds to read-back order to make sure I'm correct*\n\nR: \"Excuse me? Are we having fucking connection issues here, bitch? It better be perfect when I get there.\" \n\nMe: *just wants to get off the fucking phone* \"Okay awesome can I get a name?\"\n\n*we wrap up the call, I print the order, write down the phone number and head straight to my manager*\n\nI tell the manager what happened, and since I'm a sensitive little fuck, I cry while relaying the story. I was embarrassed and humiliated, and he said I didn't have to ring him up when he got here, and that he would speak with him.\n\nI tell my coworker who was also working the front, and she was incredibly angry. I stowed away in the office for my break, and three minutes into it, I hear yelling from the front.\n\n\"Order for Robbie is here!\" I hear yelled into the kitchen. Oh fucking boy.\n\nRobbie is screeching. He demands to see the \"stupid cunt\" that took his order, and orders my coworker to reprimand me if his food is incorrect. Fire me, cut my pay, whatever. Eventually, Robbie leaves and my manager comes to tell me he's gone. I sigh in relief, more angry than upset at this point. \n\n20 minutes pass, and the tears are dried up. I'm putting the tip jar money into the register, when the phone rings. I answer.\n\nMe: \"Hello, (name and location), how can I-\" \n\nR: \"I need your manager now.\"\n\nFeeling the tears start to well, I shoved through the back door and gave the phone to my manager. Apparently his order had mustard on it and he's never coming back. \n\nCANNOT SAY THAT I'M UPSET\n\nTL;DR A customer called for a takeout order and made it incredibly complicated, got angry when asked to clarify. Demanded I get fired. Called back later and promised to never come back. ",

It's flexible, I have minimal human interaction, my boss is laid back, and I can have side projects as long as I get all my work done. I have to interact with work studies, but it wasn't that bad until I got the computer.\n\nThe thing is, I didn't want the computer. I bring my own laptop to work every day, but most days, my phone is enough for whatever I need to do online. But for some reason, my boss insisted that I NEEDED it. Well okay. If he wanted to waste his time making the IT department bring this desktop up, I'm not going to stop him. \n\nAll the work studies flocked to it. I didn't mind, since I had no intention of using it. And I still wouldn't mind if they weren't so rude about it. Models were left on and around my desk; someone left their graded homework and tests there for weeks before I finally tossed it in the recycle bin; on one instance, a work study came in and said to the one currently using the computer, \"you're sitting in my seat.\" I had multiple talks with them about etiquette and how this wasn't their house and they needed to be more considerate of the space they were using. I don't use it but the space still didn't belong to them. \n\nToday I came in and put my things down in my chair. We don't really have a formal coat room or anything where we put our coats and backpacks so they just go in chairs or on tables in the front. It gets a little messy but usually it hasn't been a problem before. When I put my things in my chair, they move it to the table so they can sit and use the computer. I don't mind this. Except today, someone dropped my scarf on the floor and neglected to pick it up. The woman sitting at the computer stared at it and went \"sorry I didn't see that.\"\n\nI wanted to scream. I have eczema, and mt skin is sensitive. We work in a level two biohazard. I culture pathogenic bacteria. Even in a different setting, it would be unacceptable to treat another person's things like this. How are you going to drop someone's things on the floor, step on it, and pretend you don't notice. We let them get away with a lot here that they'd normally be fired for in another workplace. The least they could do is not be garbage humans. As the semester progresses, I feel like I'm getting more and more attitude from these people and I feel like it's because I'm young because this can't possibly be how these middle aged women with husbands and children would act at a \"real job.\"",

The tenant called me up to complain that his bedroom's fan light isn't working. I asked him if he changed the bulbs to which he replied, \"I'm not an idiot. The fan ain't working, you need to replace it or fix it.\" I try to set up an appointment for the super to look at it but the tenant is very resistant to idea and is angry. I finally get him to calm down and get him to at least let me see it. I take a small toolbag with me just in case. If it's simple fix, I can usually take care of it quickly. \n\nHe shows me the bedroom. The fan is connected to two wall switches. One for the fan and the other for the light on the fan. The fan works but the light doesn't. It's probably the switch and after flicking the switch, I realize that the switch gone bad. I decide to replace the switch. The tenant shouts at me. \"What are doing? The FAN is the problem!\" I stop what I'm doing and tell him that I'm addressing the problem just give me a few minutes.   \n\nHe shouts at me, \"Look, I'm in IT. I do trouble shooting all freaking day. I know what I'm talking about. The problem is clearly the fan and not the switch. You need to concentrate on the fan, take it down and either fix it or replace it. \" I ask him if in his line of work, does he first start with complicated solutions before trying the simple solutions first for a problem. He tells me to not tell him how to do his job. I go back to replacing the switch. He calls my boss to complain about me.   \n\nWhile he's doing that, I find that it was the switch. I inform the tenant and leave. My boss later tells me that I should have put the original switch back, tell the tenant that he will get a repair order set up and left the apartment. Then set appointment time for the following week. Or two weeks.\n_______________________  \n\n[Edit 1]  \nI also realize now after talking to the super that he just wants a new fan because his neighbor recently had a fan installed in his bedroom. He has been pestering the super about it ever since. Tenants are like that. They see somebody get something and then they want something too even if their stuff still works.    \n\n[Edit 2]  \nI was right. He has told me that he has seen the fan and we wants an upgrade. So we gave him an \"upgrade.\" We know the fan is the same model as his neighbor. The blades on the fan is reversible with a different design on the other side, so we just cleaned the fan and reversed the blades when we wasn't home. He's overjoyed.",

Are you planning to stay the night?\n\n&gt; **Angry**: Oh, no. We're just here for lunch.\n\n&gt; **DM**: Okay. Since this is a long weekend and the wall is packed, we're not offering the usual rate for a short stay - only the overnight rate is available. You've already been here for a couple of hours, so I'm going to have to charge you the full rate. *(Note: this has been policy for years, and it's clearly posted on all signage and paperwork)*\n\n&gt; **Angry**: But I'm only staying for lunch. I want the day rate.\n\n&gt; **DM**: Sorry, as I've explained, only the overnight rate is available on long weekends. \n\n&gt; **Angry**: I just want to stay for a couple of hours for lunch. I'm not paying a fucking overnight rate.\n\n&gt; **DM**: I understand, but if you're not going to pay I'll have to ask you to leave and free up this space for another boat who will pay.\n\n&gt; **Angry**: Who the fuck do you think you are? Fucking faggot. I want to talk to the fucking manager.\n\n&gt; **DM**: I'm the head dockmaster. I'm in charge here.\n\n&gt; **Angry**: I don't give a fuck who you are. You report to someone. I want to talk to him.\n\n&gt; **DM**: You can talk to me.\n\n&gt; **Angry**: FUCK YOU, I want to talk to your boss.\n\n&gt; **DM**: *shrug* Okay. Here's the phone number for the marina office. Ask for **G**.\n\n&gt; **Angry**: I'm going to get you *fired*, you little shit. You're fucking *done*.\n\n I've been working here for years. The docking wall where I work is separate from the main marina, so to get the job in the first place I needed a recommendation from an existing marina staff member that I was trustworthy. I don't mean to brag, but my numbers are always perfect, I get the job done more quickly than any other staff they've had in the past, and the regulars go out of their way to leave good feedback. In fact **G** has told me that if I ever have to leave for any reason, I'll always have a job here if I want it back, no questions asked. \n\nSo in short I know my boss has my back 100% of the time and I'm not even remotely worried about angry complaints. I do my best to keep complaints on the wall with me since I am the head dockmaster and **G** is very busy, but every once in a while there's someone who just won't take no for an answer.\n\n&gt; **Angry**: *(on the phone, suddenly calm and friendly)* Hello, is this **G**? Hi. I'm at [docking wall] and I just want to stay for lunch, but your dockmaster is refusing to give me the hourly rate. He's shouting and swearing and trying to kick me out. He's being extremely unprofessional and rude, I can't believe you employ staff like this ...yes... yes... I see... Oh, thank you. Thank you sir. Have a wonderful day.\n\n&gt; **Angry**, smugly: He said I could stay at the hourly rate and to see him when you get back to the office.\n\nI had pulled out my phone to text **G** as soon as I'd given **Angry** the phone number for the office. As soon as I heard Angry's shift to the overly calm friendly voice, I knew good shit was going to go down. This text conversation happened in parallel to **Angry**'s phone call:\n\n    DM: Heads up, you're about to get a call from an angry boater. He doesn't want to pay full rate to stay for lunch on the long weekend.\n\n    G: again?\n\n    DM: Everything he's saying is a lie. He's been going off on me, yelling and insulting and swearing.\n\n    G: lol what an ass\n\n    DM: He's telling me you gave him the hourly rate?\n\n    G: haha i told him to fuck off and never come back and hung up on him\n\nAnd now back to the boater:\n\n**Angry**: So you're giving me the hourly rate.\n\n**DM**: Actually I just spoke to **G**. You lied to me. You need to leave right now, and you are no longer welcome here.\n\n**Angry**: What --\n\n**DM**: Leave right now or I'm calling the police to file a trespassing report.\n\nSo at this point **Angry** storms off and starts packing up his lunch things. The older man I mentioned at the start has been standing uncomfortably off to the side, but now approaches me. He quietly apologizes to me for his son's behaviour.\n\nThey leave without further incident.\n\nLater **G** and I laugh about it and pass the story on to the rest of the staff.",

        "text": "Not sure how many parts these stories will end up being, but I thought I'd share some from the time I worked as an RCO.  RCO is short for \"Remote Control Operator.\"  Basically it's a type of a locomotive engineer, but we use a remote control pack to control the train.  Only used for switching and yard purposes though. Never on the main line.\n\nI'd been working at the mill for a good six months when the locomotive got sidelined due to a minor accident. Well...not minor, but no one was hurt. It did end up being kinda funny too, but I digress.\n\nWanting to consolidate things into a cheaper system, the company picked up a used shuttlewagon truck.  Essentially a locomotive that could also drive on the roads with rubber tires. \n\nI tended to work nights, and found that unlike the locomotive, this thing made switching VERY easy.  So it wasn't uncommon for me to have long moments where I was bored out of my mind while waiting for the hoppers, or tank cars to be loaded or unloaded.  This would prove to result in some very interesting escapades, including several parking tickets, and one young man's car trying to climb its way up a tree.  That's the story I'm about to relate.\n\nSo, one summer night, I'm sitting in the cab when I get a call to take a string of six cars out to the interchange.  I couple up and dutifully trundle my way down the mile and a half long siding to reach the small interchange yard we had with the local railroad.  About halfway down, I notice this car parked on the private access road.  Honestly, I didn't think much of it.  It happened from time to time that people would get lost and end up on our little road.  Typically it only took them a few moments before they sorted out where they were and headed off property.  It takes me a good half hour to tie down the cars, set the brakes, and then use the gravel pad (really just an old out of use crossing) to raise the rail wheels and get set up for road travel. \n\nBouncing back down the access road, I discover that the car is STILL there, and it's blocking my path.  That's when I hit upon an idea.  I'm bored, and I want to have some fun.  This will be fun.  It will also be mean, but it's still fun.\n\nI quickly kill the road lamps, and pull up within twenty feet or so from the front bumper of the car.  Waiting a moment, I flick the train lights on, turn them on high beam, and rev the engine while the wagon is in neutral, all the while giving the train horn a long honk.\n\nThe light fills the interior of the car, and I have a perfect view of what's going on.  I see one of the local teens look up, his eyes the size of saucers.  Some girl's head comes up and looks up, her mouth open in a wide scream.  The next thing I see is the car suddenly power itself full speed in reverse, jump the ditch at the side of the access road, and try to climb one of the trees (in reverse) along side that ditch.  The kid is freaking out at this point, screaming bloody murder, while I'm laughing my ass off in the cab.\n\nNext few hours were spent talking with the local police, who found the whole deal rather funny, while the teen swore up and down that his mother was going to kill him, since he'd taken the car without telling her.  I also got the impression that his bowels had voided themselves at the sudden sight, while he was thanking me profusely for managing to stop the train before it hit him.\n\nI never told him the truth.  My bosses ended up calling me on the carpet for this one, noting that while my method of dealing with trespassers was effective...they'd rather I just stuck to calling the local PD out to deal with it, as opposed to taking things into my own hands.\n\nTLDR:  Used a road capable rail car mover's lights and horn make a kid on \"lover's lane\" think he was about to be run down by a train, causing him to wreck his car trying to get away.",
