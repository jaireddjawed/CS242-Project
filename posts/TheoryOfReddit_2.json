        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)\n\nSome background and motivation. My first post was on a somewhat controversial subject. It was in a subreddit for people with unconventional sexual orientation. I clearly and openly stated that I don't contest the validity of their preferences, but offered some advise and critique regarding the responses they provide for people seeking help, which I hoped in spite of disagreements, would provoke constructive discussion. I used a flare to mark my opinion as divergent, which I was asked to do by the rules. The post wasn't confrontational. I did not mean to attack the members and had no conceited political agenda. Apparently my opinion contrasted with the majority sentiment. I got downvoted, correspondingly.\n\nThis is not the issue. But two of the three people that responded were obviously abrasive, one of them with a suggestive insult, the other with expletives, just to emphasize their disapproval. I answered in very amicable manner to the latter, to which he contributed with more expletives. I don't understand. Why was I demerited? I am a bad faith redditor, for what was written in very civil tone, a post that didn't make any disparaging allusions to the members outside of basically making my point, and took all steps according to the rules to forewarn about the divergent character of the contents? And the respondents who retorted profanely, but in alignment with the majority of the membership's opinion, even though they expressed themselves poorly, were awarded for contributing.\n\nThe consequences are, that I sought clarification on a different, technical topic and were rejected, because of a karma filter.\n\nHere are my propositions. Karma would better be deducted only for confirmed bad conduct, not for downvotes. Only for reports, and only when those pertain to breaking explicit subreddit rules, using lude language, posting off-topic, making denigrating allusions, etc, unless those are welcomed in the subreddit explicitly. Second, votes totals should be per subreddit. That should trigger rejection when you start writing content, because speaking from personal experience, it feels unjust to write for half an hour, only to get a disqualifying message and a fond memory in your history at the end.\n\nMy arguments are that just because someone faces a disagreement, even with the majority sentiment in particular subreddit, doesn't indicate strongly that they are a bad faith redditor. This traps new members, since bad karma limits their options severely and there are no clear roads to exonerate yourself. Also, it is understandable that subreddits might want to limit marginal opinions, but then it should be done on a subreddit basis, on subject vote total, not global counter, since there isn't purpose in filtering mathematics contributions on the basis of posts in MMO game or political subreddits.\n\n***TL;DR:***     Reports for bad conduct should deduct karma, not vote counts. Redditor vote total for filtering unpopular contributors should be per subreddit, not global counter.\n\nDo you approve and do you think that the technical complexity of such changes may be a problem?",

        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)\n\nA while ago, I made a post on r/leagueoflegends where I wondered why European fans are automatically fans of the European league, because I'm European, but have never had much attachment to that label, and only really my country.\n\nI'm not gonna link the post as it's probably against the rules, but to summarize, I started the post by saying that while I was European, I never considered myself as one. What that means is that it has never been a sizeable part of my identity, not that I literally don't believe that I am European. Even before posting it, I thought about wording it differently, as I am used to this site by now, and knew that someone would make a joke or call out the contradiction in that statement.\n\nI didn't bother to do so, and of course the top comment was just that. But the thing that really irks me is that I'm 100% sure that nobody out there was actually genuinely confused by what I meant. Every single person who read the post understood what I was trying to say, even if it wasn't perfectly worded, but yet this \"gotcha\" comment still got the most upvotes instead of the other comments that were actual responses to the question.\n\nThis has happened so many times to my posts and comments, the example I used in this thread was just especially memorable as it was so glaring. I've seen it happen countless times to others, and it's just so grating at this point. Maybe the first few times it's kinda interesting, but it's maybe my least favorite part about this site at this point. It wouldn't be as annoying if they weren't so consistently one of the top comments or replies.\n\nI really want a good term or word for this phenomenon.",

Maybe... but I think something else is going on also.\n\n\nI generally prefer to lurk discussion subs. If I agree with the general narrative of a community there's not much reason to contribute. I am more compelled to post when I disagree with the consensus. Because I am not 'active' anywhere in particular, and sometimes use burner accounts I encounter auto-mod pretty much all the time now (it wasn't this way years ago). \n\n\nMost subs will ask you to message the mods if you get shadowblocked/banned/post deleted etc because of account limitations. And when you do, often the mods will manually approve your posts. Many subs are strict and you have to be very mindful of the subs rules and purpose, and even tone, so to some extent to be approved you need to self censor your tone to be positive to the community you are engaging.\n\n\nBut even still, more often than not they won't approve your post. Sometimes with a reply sometimes not.\n\n\n\nSo I tested it out a couple times I was rejected and made a burner account and created an extremely pointless and low effort thread that completely agreed with the sub groupthink and then requested a manual approval. Every single time it was approved.\n\n\n\nI think 'spam' is used kind of arbitrarily to actually mean 'post the mod doesn't like' and for many subs the goal of the moderator is not the preserve civility or rules in a community. They take on that role to manage the groupthink.",

I am pretty sure there are other factors than IP which Reddit takes into consideration. People using VPNs have failed to bypass ban by creating a new account. As of what I read, some power users configure TOR Browser to bypass ban! This is some real shit.\n\nCan anyone enlighten me of how Reddit manages to mitigate ban evasions?\n\nPS: One fun thing, which came to my mind, why doesn't Youtube/Twitter do the same to block Spam comments/posts!",

If I came across a new, controversial position. I replied with disagreement but offering absolutely no content at all. Pretty much just replying \"No u\" over and over to see how many responses I get before the other user eventually tires and gives up.\n\nWell, actually in the end most of the time the users wore me down and I gave up, despite my intentions to not engage, just respond with one or 2 words.\n\nTypically, users would stop after 6-10 replies, but in some instances, users replied to me over 20 times over several days. Remember I am only replying with useless things like \"you're wrong\", \"no u\", \"I don't agree\". I mostly did not even read their reply.\n\nI wondered if it's just an internet thing, so I tried the same tactic on twitter and youtube. Youtube I would get 1 reply back at most. Twitter maybe 2 then blocked. It is a unique reddit experience. But I can't understand why.",

        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)\n\nA few years back, Reddit added the ability to follow users directly so that their posts show up on your frontpage like any other subreddit. As far as I can tell, this feature has been left in maintenance mode and only the NSFW side of Reddit even uses it to a minor degree. However, this feature is what makes me think Reddit could be a viable Twitter alternative given just a few tweaks and enhancements. Everyone mentions Mastodon as a decentralized alternative, but the friction between different Mastodon federations makes that a nonstarter for those seeking to be a part of the global community that Twitter represents. Reddit's centralization works to its advantage in this case -- it has the infrastructure to support a Twitter-sized userbase and half of a feature that would make it a viable Twitteralike.\n\nTwitter's recent troubles have got me thinking about this dormant feature a bit more. One of the distinguishing characteristics of a social media site is its approach to moderation, and Reddit's approach of letting each individual community have its own moderation policy gives it a flexibility that Twitter lacks. Reddit has its Terms of Use that disallow most of the same things other social media sites disallow (copyright infringement, illegal content, egregious hate speech, etc.), but each individual subreddit has the ability to tailor their own moderation level to one agreeable to its own community.\n\nThe fact that an individual user's profile posts end up being their own responsibility to moderate is one of the (many) reasons for that feature's failure. When you post to a subreddit, you automatically outsource the moderation of all of the comments you receive to the mods. For your own profile, you must either read every single comment yourself, or find volunteers to moderate your own user profile. This might not be a big ask for content creators with their own preexisting communities, but it's not an easily findable feature even for them. See if you can find the trail of links you must follow to get to https://www.reddit.com/user/me/about/edit/moderation\n\nOne alternative I could think of is a feature where you can opt in to sending your user profile's posts to a subset of mods of a community you trust (of course the mods would also need to individually opt in to the extra work). It'd let people who trust, for example, the mods of a subreddit like r/askscience, get something close to the moderation quality of an established community.\n\nAnother enhancement that'd make Reddit a more legitimate alternative to Twitter would be the ability to let user comments show up on your frontpage if you're subscribed to them. This already exists to an MVP extent on the user profile Overview tab, where you can see comments in the context of the post they're on. It would serve a role similar to Twitter's replies, where you see the tweet someone you're following has replied to.\n\nWhat other tweaks do you think Reddit would have to make to become a viable Twitteralike?\n\nI haven't explored the costs and benefits to Reddit of such a move yet, but I can think of one cost being damage to the default expectation that on Reddit you are interacting with someone relatively anonymous. What other costs and benefits do you think there'd be?",

        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)   \n\nFrom my position, it's done nothing good for my personal reddit experience, anyway.  Quite the opposite.  Had I not found a way to block the gifs from appearing completely I may have actually left after 13 some years here with much regret.  Simply because of how it had begun to ruin my experience.   \n\nI wonder if there is an argument which can sway me a little?  \n\nIMO it's the lowest effort way to engage, to the point I don't understand why they even bother.  It's essentially a more advanced emoticon.   \n\nA single gif post in a thread is almost like an invitation for others to now do the same.  I've seen this effect snowball many times.  Often you can tell that the first gif was a trigger, because the thread had been on track until that point, then suddenly more and more will appear.  \n\nAgain, personally I do not like them.  They ugly up the clean page of text I'd prefer to view and they are overused to the point of abuse.  If it were 1 or 2 gifs in a thread here or there it'd be no real problem.  When I'm seeing up to 10 gif posts, in a row in the top comments, nested with other gifs forever, that's an issue for me.   That's just my own opinion, I suspect some will share it however.   \n\nFurther, I can't count how many times I've clicked a users profile to see that they ONLY post gifs, popular ones, and they spam the fuck out of it.  Clearly it's another way to farm cheap karma.  IMO it encourages \"shit posting\" in various ways for various reasons, as per my definition of shit posting, anyway.  \n\nIt can also stifle conversation.  Why would someone on the fence deciding to contribute to a thread or not go to the effort of explaining why the thread topic really surprised them?  I mean, they can just post the Wee-Bey gif to express surprise.  They know gifs are almost always upvoted, and typing out a few lines of text takes time, some thought, and is not assured to be upvoted.  Fuck it why not just post a gif?   \n\nReddit has become more and more focused on this \"quick content\" stuff over the years, but to me I still just come here to converse and maybe learn a thing or two.  I understand why it might have been done.  Posters who may not contribute normally might be more inclined to post a gif so more engagement, which while I see as a negative reddit probably sees opposite.  \n\nIn it's own way gifs are a kind of language, for lack of a better term, and from what my small experience with \"new reddit\" has been, it certainly seems setup to encourage more of the standard social media culture, a big part of which is gif posting.    \n\nI suspect the demographic is also lower than I'd expect.  I can especially imagine teens thinking gif posting is a huge upgrade.  I mean I don't know that it's so easy to say \"younger people always use more gifs than older\" but I feel like the statement in general may be correct more times than not.  \n\nBasically I'm against it for many reasons, some are just personal preference but some I actually do believe are detrimental to reddit (but again that's detrimental to my ideal version of reddit.)  \n\nWhat are your opinions, or observations, or theories about how gif posting has impacted reddit as a whole and your own experience?  \n\nCan you make a good argument for if/how they've improved the general reddit experience?",

        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)\n\nOr, at least, ideally there shouldn't be. Let me explain.\n\nInteractions on reddit fall into one of three categories:\n\n1. Content engagement\n2. Content curation\n3. Content moderation\n\nLike many other social media sites, Reddit is somewhat *usable* without being logged in. Your interactions are limited to scrolling through posts &amp; comments and search, but for many use cases that's more than enough. What you *can't* do is change anything about Reddit in any way: you cannot create posts and comments yourself and, more importantly, you cannot participate in voting. Without a login, you're using reddit in *read-only* mode. You're interacting with the *website* of Reddit without actually interacting with the community. Feedback is only going one way.\n\nOnce you create an account, your options expand. For most users this is limited to voting and creating posts &amp; comments. Despite being simple concepts these interactions make up the vast majority of engagement on the site. What you're reading right now is a post. If you like it, you can upvote it and make it more visible. If you hate it, you can downvote it to make it *less* visible. Most people are ambivalent and won't vote at all, leaving it in the same place they found it. You may find this post engaging enough to leave your own comment, and then some other user can make the same kinds of decisions about your comment that you made about my post. This goes on and on in a nicely recursive way in a format we've all come to understand and appreciate. This is the core of Reddit.\n\nNot everyone appreciates the same content the same way, though. Reddit in its early days didn't have subreddits at all. This created an issue with NSFW content: some users wanted it, and upvoted it because it was relevant to them, but other users didn't want to see it at all, and would downvote it. The value of the content wasn't intrinsically related to the content itself, but existed in relation to the person consuming it. The admins had a problem where different groups had different ideas about what \"good\" content was, and they solved this issue by creating the first subreddit: /r/NSFW. Users that were interested in this topic had a place to go to find it, and they could upvote and downvote relative the the value the content had in relation to the subreddit's topic. Those that were totally uninterested could simply not be part of that sub, and wouldn't have to spend their time downvoting things that weren't relevant to them.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before users could create their own subreddits. One of the great parts of Reddit is that *anyone* can create their own subreddit, and it's a feature heavily emphasized by the site itself. This leads us to our second paradigm of Reddit interaction: content curation.\n\nModerators play a crucial role on Reddit. They're responsible for the theme, style, rules, and static content of a subreddit. While they can remove anything that doesn't fit, and even pin their own posts, moderators do not directly determine what is popular on a subreddit. All subreddits, even heavily curated ones, rely on users voting to bring the best content to the top while pushing down low-quality content. There have been many cases where the desires of a subreddit's community diverge from the direction of the moderators. Sometimes, prominent community members found a new subreddit which aligns better with the desires of the users, and the users migrate over (or stay in both communities). Sometimes, the old moderators will step down and let a new group take over. In either case, it's inevitable that a subreddit whose community doesn't align with its moderators will be facing a change at some point in the future.\n\nSo what powers to moderators really have? As mentioned before, moderators can remove posts &amp; comments, and even pin their own. They can ban users, create or remove subreddit rules, modify Automoderator to automatically handle common issues, and even change the kind of content that can be posted. With this power comes responsibility: moderators are expected to keep a subreddit true to its purpose, keep out bad actors, and enforce the rules of the sub. These are all reasonable expectations given their powers moderators have. The powers moderators have are specifically designed around giving them the ability to carry out their responsibilities. Moderators effectively have the power to *curate* the subreddits they oversee.\n\nHowever, the expectation of moderators is to do more than just curate. As their name implies, they are expected to *moderate* content, which brings us to our third paradigm of interaction. \"But wait,\" you say, \"what's the difference between curating and moderating?\" That's an excellent and astute question! The central thesis of this post is that there is a clear delineation between the two. *Curation* is the act of creating an environment where the activity in a subreddit matches the expectations of the community. A subreddit about frogs should have frog-related content. A subreddit about trees should have tree-related content (in theory, anyway, but that's another story...) Beyond simply keeping things on-topic, part of the process of curation may require a moderator to remove content that negatively impacts the community in some other way. The kind of content that damages the spirit of a sub can vary. Some subreddits want to stay entirely apolitical, even if political content is allowed on other subs. Some subreddits, like debate subs, tolerate back-and-forth arguments, while others may nip those in the bud if things get out of hand. Different subs have different degrees to which they tolerate rude comments and profanity.\n\nHowever, **there are some things that no subreddit is allowed to tolerate**. These would be the things that go directly against site-wide rules, like hate speech, targeted harassment, and involuntary pornography. If you create a subreddit to promote these things, it will be deleted by the admins in short order. If your subreddit harbors content that violates site-wide rules, whether through moderator inactivity or moderator tolerance, action will be taken. Beyond simply curating the theme of a subreddit, moderators are expected to ensure that *all* content posted meets Reddit's guidelines. From here we see that there is a clear difference between *curation*, which shapes a subreddit to meet the needs of a specific community and is ultimately optional, and *moderation*, which removes content that Reddit has a legal liability not to harbor and is [mandatory for any moderator](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct).\n\nWhile it's clear that *curation* is required for a subreddit to support its community, *moderation* is simply an extra layer on top, keeping the content of Reddit uniformly conformant to a specific set of rules. While I have no problem with the site-wide rules, it stands to reason that, since these rules are universally applicable, they would not necessarily require enforcement from the moderators of any specific subreddit. Reddit admins can remove content if needed, and most moderators are familiar with AEO or Anti-Evil Operations, which is a bot that automatically removes content that breaks site-wide rules. Reddit has no specific obligation to keep curate the subreddits that it contains, just as Reddit has no obligation to keep up- and down-vote counts at any specific threshold. The community control **is** the point, in these cases. This is in stark contrast from their obligation to enforce site-wide rules, which comes from the potential *legal liability* of allowing content that breaks these rules.\n\nDoes it make sense, then, for subreddit moderators to be responsible for keeping out content that breaks site-wide rules? I'm sure almost every moderator wants the *ability* to do so, as content that breaks site-wide rules is almost universally toxic and keeping toxicity out is a crucial part of keeping a subreddit healthy. However, ability and responsibility are not the same thing. The responsibility that moderators have to curate their communities is a responsibility *to the community itself*, and as described above there are ways for subreddit communities to address a failure to meet these responsibilities. Healthy and thriving subreddits communities are ultimately good for Reddit, so moderators *indirectly* have an incentive to curate responsibly from the site itself, but this responsibility is not in any way unforced. This is unlike the responsibility of moderators to keep content in line with site-wide rules, in that a failure to meet these responsibilities will be met with action by the admins.\n\nWhat does it mean for moderators when their primary function, the curation of a subreddit, is not required by admins and is only loosely controlled by communities? What does it mean for moderators when Reddit's responsibility to keep content in line with legal requirements falls to the purview of moderators, under penalty of removal or community quarantine or banishment? Reddit admins have access to an entire suite of tools and a plethora of user data to make use of while enforcing their site-wide standards. Moderators have more options now than previously, but even with crowd control options and ban evasion notices, moderators are hamstrung in comparison to admins when it comes to keeping their communities safe from site-wide rule-breakers. Wouldn't it be better to separate the act of curation from the act of moderation, at least in accordance with the consequence of failure in either paradigm?\n\nShould reddit moderators be required to do more than simply curate? Should reddit moderators be moderators at all?",
