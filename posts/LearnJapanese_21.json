        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So someone recently made me aware of [Project EGG](https://www.amusement-center.com/project/egg/) which is sort of a Japanese equivalent to GOG except it's actually been around since *2001*. They have a lot of games from Oldschool Japanese computers like the MSX and PC-98 and what's more is once you've signed up they have a collection of [over 200 free games](https://www.amusement-center.com/project/egg/freegames/) with *a lot* of visual novels represented and they add a new one every month! There's an absolutely massive amount of material at different levels and I think it's a great resource for practice material. The site is apparently at least partially run in conjunction with a Japanese game preservation group which is pretty cool.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The *catch* though, is that in order to download these free games and be able to purchase the non-free ones, you have to pay a monthly 500 yen subscription fee (though if you stop subscribing you still keep your stuff). Frankly it's weird and seems needlessly complex, but apparantly the games are pretty close to DRM-free. That said, if you can only \"officially\" have them installed to one PC at a time or something and have to do some weird license transfer thing if you want \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Their game launcher is a bit... oldschool, it looks like an early 2000's MP3 player, but supposedly they're reworking it soon. I'm hoping that will also entail a rework with their weird licensing system but overall the experience has been largely painfree aside from Malwarebytes flagging some games (so I had to whitelist the install folder). \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Weirdly they also have a separate english website [with english versions of some games](https://www.amusement-center.com/en/project/egg/memberpage/index.shtml) but it's clearly had a lot less love  and the selection is far smaller, but you're not here for english games, you're hear to read some japanese! The switcher lets you swap to your english library which also switches to the english UI, but since the english and japanese \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I'm currently checking out a game called [Apple Sauce 7](http://www.amusement-center.com/project/egg/game/?product_id=799) which is extremely cute and so far I've been able to read the text presented in it. Anyway this post probably reads a bit like an ad but even though I don't love some decisions they make with their setup the selection's pretty insane and registration wasn't hard. They do ask for your name in both Kana and Kanji but it didn't care when I wrote it in English and paypal works for payments. The only signup issue I had is that the passwrod field doesn't let you use Symbols like ! or @ but once I realized that I was good.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Really I mostly just thought it was fascinating that Japan's had their own Steam since before Gaben and a lot of these are obscure games by popular companies that people might be interested in digging into, since part of language learning is getting that good shit you can't find anywhere else.",

        "title": "[Review] I finished the Duolingo japanese course",
        "author": "Tobio-Star",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10715m1/review_i_finished_the_duolingo_japanese_course/",
        "text": "#  --&gt;[TLDR at the end üòâ]&lt;--\n\nWarning: this review is about the former most recent version of Duolingo, between January 2021 and July 2022 (so the new path version from August is not included). I wanted to post this since august when I finished the course but I had other priorities\n\n**My experience**\n\nAfter about 1 and ¬Ω year, I finished the entire course of Duolingo and got every single unit to gold. Upon finishing the course, I knew between 2,5 and 3k words, and grammar up to early N3 (I just finished N4). During that time period, Duolingo has been my main study tool and I estimate I owed about 90% of my Japanese knowledge to it.\n\n**Shortcomings**\n\nSo does it work? Short answer, yes. Duolingo does a good job covering all the very basics of Japanese. Would I recommend it? Definitely not. Let me explain. The Japanese course on Duolingo is mainly a word learning course. Each unit will introduce you to a couple new words (between 15 and 30), then it will incorporate some of those words into sentences, and finally those sentences will try to teach a couple grammar points as well. Assuming, you get each unit to max level, most words are gonna stick. But Duolingo has some serious problems:\n\n1- The word review system is ineffective\n\nI had to put the entire course on a separate review app (Anki) to be really able to say that I \"know\" the vocab. Since Duolingo relies so heavily on sentences and only rarely drill individual words, it seems like they haven‚Äôt found a way to make the user review previous words effectively and consistently. \n\nI kinda get it since creating sentences that a) teach words and grammar, and b) review previously learned material while not being overly complex is pretty difficult. Furthermore, for a word study app, it is not very effective. I estimate that I learned about 4-5 words a day and that‚Äôs very very slow. In order to have good results in a reasonable amount of time, I feel like one should be aiming for at least 10-15 a day.\n\n2- The grammar teaching side is really bad.\n\nDuolingo barely provides any grammar explanation. They just throw grammar into different sentences and hope you will figure out the grammar point inside them by seeing the same pattern over and over again. The problem is, Japanese is way too different from English for that to be effective.\n\nSo in order for me to teach myself grammar, I had to abuse of the ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù forum. Under each question, there is a button for discussion. Inside that discussion, 90% of the time,  some advanced users usually give a clear explanation about the grammar point used. This is the way I learned grammar for the vast majority of cases. While that worked, it will obviously never fair to explanations given by teachers or professionals. You will get basic explanations for grammar points, but getting in-depth explanations is rare (and there is also the small but notable risk of errors or contradictions from users).\n\n3- It doesn‚Äôt teach kanji. At all.\n\nDuolingo pretty much doesn‚Äôt explain anything about radicals, kanji meanings or pronunciations. They teach the words and hope you will miraculously learn the kanji inside by sheer repetition. A crazy amount of kanji looked identical to me before I started using a specialized kanji book on the side (‚ÄúRemembering The Kanji‚Äù by James Heisig).\n\n**It‚Äôs not effective ‚Ä¶ but it works**\n\nStill, I want to make it clear: if you don‚Äôt have a dollar for language learning and aren‚Äôt interested in other methods, you should definitely consider Duolingo because it works and it‚Äôs free. Duolingo is fun, pretty and gives motivation to study. It‚Äôs also an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù way to learn Japanese since it teaches words and grammar, and how to construct sentences from basic to reasonably complex. However, pretty much any other study method will be more efficient than Duolingo. Its biggest strength, vocab learning, is actually very weak and should be supplemented by a review system like Anki.\n\n**TIPS**\n\nIf you still want to use Duolingo (that‚Äôs okay), I have a couple tips I think could help\n\n*1- Use and re-use the ‚ÄúDiscuss‚Äù section*\n\nThis is probably the most important thing to remember. When using Duolingo, you should basically spam the ‚ÄúDiscuss‚Äù button under each question. Every time you have a doubt about what a sentence means or some weird grammar you‚Äôve never seen before, see what others said about it on that tab. Without the ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù section, Duolingo would be almost unusable\n\n*2- Make your own review system for every word and piece of grammar*\n\nLike I said, Duolingo‚Äôs review system is atrocious. I recommend using a separate review app like ‚ÄúAnki‚Äù and writing down every information you understood from the app. Let‚Äôs see concrete examples for reviewing vocabulary and grammar\n\na) For vocab, it‚Äôs pretty easy. On the question side (the ‚Äúfront‚Äù), I put the word in kanji or hiragana. On the back, I put the pronunciation and up to 2 possible meanings of the word. Here is an example for the word Âá∫„Çã\n\nFront:Âá∫„Çã\n\nBack: Pronunciation = ‚Äúderu‚Äù, meaning = ‚Äúto leave, to participate‚Äù\n\nb) For grammar, it‚Äôs not as simple. On the front, I try to put the grammar pattern using general terms (like ‚ÄúX, Y‚Äù). On the back, I put the meaning and, if necessary, a concrete application of that grammar. Here are 2 examples\n\nExample 1\n\nFront: „ÅäÈáë„ÅÆ„Åã„Åã„ÇãX\n\nBack: meaning = ‚Äúan expensive X‚Äù, application = ‚Äú„ÅäÈáë„ÅÆ„Åã„Åã„Çã„ÅîÈ£Ø-&gt; an expensive meal ¬ª\n\nExample 2\n\nFront: X„Å´Ê∞¥„Çí„ÇÑ„Çã\n\nBack:meaning = ‚Äúto water up X‚Äù, application = ‚ÄúÂ∫≠„Å´Ê∞¥„Çí„ÇÑ„Çã-&gt; to water up the garden‚Äù\n\nI took very simple examples to be clear, but for more complicated grammar pattern, you will have to get creative and find a way to make yourself remember how to use those patterns.\n\n*3- Double-check the meaning of every word on jisho*\n\nI recommend not relying on the built-in dictionary on Duolingo since it contains many errors. Jisho is one of the best free Japanese dictionary.\n\n*4- Don‚Äôt be ashamed of copying the answer when needed.*\n\nI did that for 3 reasons:\n\na) I was certain that my answer was correct. Since Duolingo is based on volunteers adding all the possible answers, it‚Äôs very likely they might miss a correct translation.\n\nb) I knew the answer but had no idea what to type in (the required answers can be either unnatural or archaic English).\n\nc)the sentence was too complex and included notions I had never seen before.\n\nTrust me on this: if you are too strict about typing in exactly what they want you to type, you are in for hours of frustrations. It's okay to \"\"cheat\"\" sometimes as long as you made an effort to understand the question.\n\n*5- Keep virtual or real notes about harder notions*\n\nAfter reading a big explanation about a complicated grammar point (like the role of the particle „ÅØin Japanese for example) on the ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù forum, I recommend writing it down in your own words to make sure you understood what you read. That way, you can come back to it if needed. I also liked to break down complicated sentences that I repeatedly failed and put them in my notes. That way, I would be prepared for when they appear again on the next study sessions.\n\n**Resources I recommend over Duolingo**\n\nDuolingo makes me believe that looking for a resource that teaches every aspect of Japanese might not be the best way to deal with a language this complex. Making a resource that is good enough at teaching vocab, grammar and kanji at the same time is extremely hard. So I recommend instead using resources that focus on one aspect of Japanese at a time.\n\nFor vocabulary, I recommend getting a large vocab pack with between 6k and 10k words. One of ‚ÄúAnki core 10k, Torii-srs, or Anki core 2k/6k‚Äù should do the job. You could also make your own vocab pack but I personally think it‚Äôs too time consuming. \n\nFor grammar, I recommend using a specialized grammar website like Bunpro. Bunpro (with an r, not ‚ÄúBunpo‚Äù) teaches the important grammar points from N5 to N1 and features a built-in SRS system to review everything learned.\n\nFor kanji, I recommend RTK (remembering the kanji 1) or Wanikani. Those resources are going to teach you the shapes of the 2000 most important kanji as well as their basic meaning. Since Wanikani also tries to teach vocab, I would prefer to use RTK and let the vocab part to something like core 10k.\n\nUse one resource per category and that‚Äôs it. Using too many resources at the same time is probably less efficient than just using Duolingo and focusing on it.\n\n\\-------------\n\n**TLDR**: While Duolingo definitely works, it‚Äôs one of the worst resources you can use for learning Japanese. However if you have no other choices, then there is absolutely no shame in using it! Duolingo will still get the job done: you will learn about 2.5k words and most beginner grammar points (especially if you use my tips). It‚Äôs just super slow alongside having a very weak review system.",

I find this helpful for getting used to different rhythms of speech. \n\nHe also posts Instagram Stories with lots of text, so can be a good source for reading comprehension too. \n\nHere's his profile: https://instagram.com/tsenseidayo?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= \n\nRelatedly, looking up popular hashtags from Japanese Instagram and then seeking out content from native speakers who use the hashtags has been really useful for me.

I know this works if you use English because I tested it in the \"Learning English\" section of memrise and just said \"hello\" into the mic and it worked. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!",

The preface to the sentence, Ëá™ÊÖ¢„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ„Åå, is something along the lines of \"not trying to boast\". The part im having trouble with is the rest. In particular, originally I thought this sentence was saying \"I have only not participated in gambling\". As in gambling is the ONLY thing he had not participated in, as the „Å†„Åë comes directly after „ÇÆ„É£„É≥„Éñ„É´. The following sentence however, clearly states that he HAD gambled in the past. \n\nSo following that logic, this sentence is trying to say he DID gamble. As far as I know „Å†„Åë does not follow the same rule as „Åó„Åã that when followed by a negative indicates positive and exclusivity. I am completely stuck trying to decipher this. Can anyone help me out and explain why this sentence means what it does?",

Or at least the least worst. \nI know that if you are in Japan should have a lot of opportunities to practice but being honest, If you will pay almost one million yen for a tuition (one year), Why do you have to settle on just going to school to have teachers read the grammar books page by page? \n\nPS: I‚Äôm not English native speaker, sorry for the writing mistakes in advance.",

        "title": "Japanese New Years Resolution Feedback Request",
        "author": "Xefjord",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1060o3n/japanese_new_years_resolution_feedback_request/",
        "text": " Hello Everyone!\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n**Some Background**\n\nI am Xefjord, and I have been a fan of language learning for 11 years now, and Japanese was kind of my first love when it came to languages. I started studying in my final year of middle school because of anime and manga (familiar story I am sure) but continued to study intermittently for 7 years with the end goal of teaching English in Japan. I went to college for IT because my parents agreed to pay for my degree (Despite wanting to go for English or Japanese) and with the coronavirus and some health anxiety, I slowly kind of gave up on those dreams and went on a 4 year hiatus of the language. I have worked in IT for 2 years now, and while it is a good job, my anxieties and overall health has improved substantially, and I have been thinking about Japan again. So I made studying JP my new years resolution.\n\nI have read the entirety of Genki 1 roughly 4 times over during my 7 year study, and gotten a couple chapters into Genki 2. I was very good about talking with Japanese natives locally and on HiNative/Tandem, and I also talked to myself frequently. I finished the entire Lingodeer Japanese course (Which is supposedly about all of Genki 1 and half of Genki 2), I also kept a journal which I had going for half a year in only Japanese.\n\nThe first 4 years of studying Japanese were so intermittent because I was a young kid who had no idea how to study, this was before Japanese Duolingo. The last 3 years were so intermittent because I kept getting distracted by studying Korean and Chinese which was more locally relevant to where I lived in Midwestern America. So I am in a weird position where I have studied a long time, but very intermittently, and made a lot of progress in random areas, but unaware of what all those areas are.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\n**New Years Resolution**\n\nI want to try to reach at least the beginnings of a JLPT N2 level by the end of the year. I understand that to be roughly 1k Kanji and 6k vocab. I have split my study into daily checkboxes that go something like this:\n\n**‚óã JP Grammar Study** \\- This will involve daily progress in a grammar course, I am using the new app YuSpeak made by a friend of mine to review all the JLPT N5 content in a new way before I tackle the same old Genki 1 review for a 5th time. I hope to finish both YuSpeak and Genki 1 by or shortly after the end of this month, because it is all technically review. After that I plan to read Genki 2, then Tobira, and I own the Shin Kanzen Master Series JLPT N2 books. I am going to shoot to get as far as I can, but I am confident I can at least finish Tobira by the end of the year.\n\n**‚óã JP Vocab Study** \\- This almost universally takes place on Anki, where I have three primary decks I am progressing. The first one is the Kodansha Kanji Learners Course deck, where I am (for right now) doing 8 new kanji a day. It teaches the core 2300 main Kanji. And with each flashcard I am practicing writing the character, understanding the meanings, as well as memorizing at least one related word's meanings and readings so I know how to use the Kanji in at least one instance. I also have the Core 6k deck which I am going about 20 cards through a day. and I have a personal deck where I take words I encounter in reading, writing, listening, and speaking practice that I want to learn and memorize sooner, and I add them in the natural context I encountered them to a personal deck which I do 10 cards of a day. These study numbers may go up or down based upon the workload/demand.\n\n**‚óã JP Writing Study** \\- I have a google doc where I am journaling every day in only Japanese. I don't allow myself to use google translate at all except for translating for Japanese -&gt; English to double check my work. I will use Jisho for some words I don't know, but when I do I will add them to my personal Anki Deck.\n\n**‚óã JP Speaking Study** \\- For right now I have this set to 3 times per week dedicated, but it will likely increase as I get further into my study. I spend at least 30 minutes on Tandem/Discord talking in only Japanese with natives or other learners of a similar or higher level. Especially if I can get some Japanese friends or a static study group, I expect this number to go up substantially. I also practice speaking to myself in Japanese daily.\n\n**‚óã JP Content Study** \\- I am not doing this as much until I get to the end of Genki 2, but this is essentially where I am going to just force myself to sit down and read a LOT more. I have numerous physical volumes of Yotsubato, Chii's Sweet Home, Nisekoi, Golden Kamuy, and an assorted range of light novels. As well as over 50 visual novels that support Japanese. There is of course free resources like NHK News Easy and more that I can rely upon as well. I will be dedicating myself by hopefully at least 1/3rd to halfway through the year to spending a good chunk of time on just reading native content. I also have a large amount of Japanese Youtubers I can follow as well. I will likely switch to a full immersion environment halfway to 2/3rds through the year by only allowing myself to do things in Japanese.\n\n\\----------------\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf this sounds like a lot, that is because it is. I am looking at at least 3-5 hours of study every day. I am being a little more relaxed this first month as it is all mostly review, but I plan to pick up the pace considerably after I have kept a solid streak and start getting into newer content. I have previously done months of 8 hours of Korean study a day (which I ultimately burned out from, but I don't plan on going that intense if at all until near the end) so I know how to put in the hours on daily study.\n\nI think motivation is a huge factor in regards to language learning success, part of what made studying Japanese difficult in the past was not seeing a near term use for the language and conflicting thoughts on where I might want to go teach English after college. But I have set a very specific goal and intention for this year:\n\nI am interested in teaching English in Japan in 2024, so my desire is to reach the highest level of Japanese possible this year, so that my time spent in Japan next year can be enjoyed as fruitfully as possible. I have a bachelors IT degree, a decent history of working with language learning app companies, my own language teaching website, and a passion for educating others (Plus I am a native English speaker). So I think I can be an attractive candidate.\n\nI am using this goal as mid term motivation to succeed and at least thus far have a week long unbroken streak.\n\nIf anyone has any feedback on how to improve my study, or just general advice on reaching my goals and going to Japan in general, it is all appreciated :) I am definitely not *new* to Japanese per say, but I still have a lot to learn and plan to take it seriously.",

Then I have to remember the reading for the ones that don't contain kanji as well, and the meaning. So I decided to learn kanji individually and a few key words with them. It makes learning a words reading in kanji much easier if I know the form and meaning of a kanji already. \n\nOther than that I'm learning vocabulary. I started learning them so English is on the front then when I flip it the kanji with furigana is on the back with the kanji being small but i barely look at it. I can either do that or have it so kanji is on the front with furigana on top, then they'll be kana and english when I flip the card. Which one should I do? Having only kanji on the front is too difficult when I don't know the individual kanjis.",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI came up with a study method a few months, which essentially consists of going through all of Jisho's list of words tagged as common, kanji by kanji. In other words, I go down the list of kanji sorted by grade level(in the same order as japanese kids learn at school), look them up in jisho and only add the ones tagged as common to my Anki deck. I've found that this avoids the confusion of essentially guessing kanji's and their readings by how they look, and it grants me the assurance of tangibly knowing whether I know a word or not. For example, if I see a word starting with the kanji Â§ß, and I've already gone through the common words starting with it in Jisho, unless it is a very uncommon word or a compound of some sort, I know that I've already learnt it. Also, since I'm studying kanji's individually, I also learn their readings along with the words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, making the cards and reviewing is all but fun, so I decided to also watch anime to make my days a little brighter. But, while I'm at it, I thought I might as well mine some sentences I don't know from these anime. However, I don't want to have any duplicate between the deck in which I learn common words in Jisho, and the one for sentence mining. That's why, I would really appreciate if someone could guide me to a resource which would allow me to have a tag next to the word on the Yomichan popup saying whether it's classified as a common word in Jisho or not. That way, if a word is not common, I know that I won't go over it during my study, and I'll be able to mine it without having any duplicates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if I explained my issue in the most clear manner, so I'll clarify confusions if there are any, and thanks in advance.",

        "text": "I just moved to Japan last month. I've been studying Japanese for about a year on my own. I have a lot of friends in Japan who want to teach me Japanese, and I am also starting weekly tutoring next week. The only problem with learning from my friends is that they don't know English, so we have to rely on Google Translate. It's not always super effective.\n\nI also started watching Japanese television because I have cable but I don't have Wi-Fi. I feel like television is one of the most useful things because I have a full immersive experience as there are no subtitles. Because my job doesn't allow me to speak Japanese at work, I am unable to have a fully immersive experience in Japan 24/7.\n\nIf anyone has any tips from their own personal experiences, I'd love to hear it. Life in Japan is really rough when you don't speak Japanese, so I'm trying to reach fluency as quick as possible. I'm fully prepared to study 1.5+ hours a day if that's what it takes.\n\nThanks in advance! üòÉ",

While I have really enjoyed the class and feel ive learend a lot of japanese, it doesnt apply to any major requirements so I cant take any more classes after the next one due to unit capacity. I want to continue learning japanese after im not taking a class anymore but I dont know which textbook is right for self study after 2 semesters of a japanese language class. \n\nFor a refrence to what Ive covered Im pretty much able to hold a conversation with someone about easy topics like family, weather, school, interests, and travelling and will be taking an aditional course with more content in the spring. \n\nSo after a year of japanese language classes, what are some good self study books? Probably enetering at the iintermediate level? Ive been looking at genki and „Åø„Çì„Å™„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨Ë™û but other than that im in the dark. \n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated!\n\n„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„ÅüÔºÅ",
