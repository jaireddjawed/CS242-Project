The gray patch on the moon has been filled in with moon-like details.\n\nIt's literally adding in detail that weren't there.

Did the same test on my Pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max to prove they\u2019re onto something.","author":"SamsungAppleOnePlus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11onztx\/uibreakphotos_sent_a_very_interesting_test\/","text":"The [original post in question.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11nzrb0\/samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are_fake_and_here\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Again, credit to u\/ibreakphotos for the idea and test.\n\nTLDR is that they noticed Samsung was artificially adding detail to moon photos (that isn\u2019t physically there) to make them look better. They simply used a blurry image of the moon and got [this result](https:\/\/imgur.com\/ULVX933).\n\nNow, I\u2019ve taken many moon photos on Samsung phones, they\u2019re definitely amazing and now I realize they\u2019re too amazing. [Galaxy S22 Ultra examples](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/nGt3SJg). But I was wondering if anybody else is currently performing similar tactics. I recall that Huawei was preferring similar artificial wizardry a while back. My two primary phones are a Pixel 7 Pro and and iPhone 14 Pro Max. I\u2019ve taken multiple moon photos on both. [Pixel 7 Pro examples](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/AFfXev5), and [iPhone 14 Pro Max examples](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/jKdDH4i). Neither are as \u201cclean\u201d looking as Samsung, I think that speaks for itself, but I wanted to test both the way u\/ibreakphotos did regardless.\n\nSo I took the blurry moon image used in that test, and AirPlay-ed onto a TV. My results are:\n\n[Pixel 7 Pro](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/1wVu4Dx)\n\n[iPhone 14 Pro Max](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ENnUbT0)\n\nNeither did anything to improve the blurry moon, compared to the result u\/ibreakphotos got. [This link again](https:\/\/imgur.com\/ULVX933)\n\nSo I definitely agree Samsung is using AI to make their moon photos look better than it would be otherwise, while passing it off as hardware based. **I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all \u201cfake\u201d though**, instead it\u2019s simply boosting details based on what the moon typically looks like. It\u2019s very, very interesting. And I wonder if Samsung will eventually comment on this find. Edit: They have.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678551244.0},{"title":"Samsung \"space zoom\" moon shots are fake, and here is the proof","author":"ibreakphotos","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11nzrb0\/samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are_fake_and_here\/","text":"Many of us have witnessed the breathtaking moon photos taken with the latest zoom lenses, starting with the S20 Ultra. Nevertheless, I've always had doubts about their authenticity, as they appear almost too perfect. While these images are not necessarily outright fabrications, neither are they entirely genuine. Let me explain.\n\nThere have been many threads on this, and many people believe that the moon photos are real ([inputmag](https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/input\/reviews\/is-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-using-ai-to-fake-detailed-moon-photos-investigation-super-resolution-analysis)) - even MKBHD has claimed [in this popular youtube short](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/6P1VRs68Cqo) that the moon is not an overlay, like Huawei has been accused of in the past. But he's not correct. So, while many have tried to prove that Samsung fakes the moon shots, I think nobody succeeded - until now.\n\n**WHAT I DID**\n\n1) I downloaded this high-res image of the moon from the internet - https:\/\/imgur.com\/PIAjVKp\n\n2) I downsized it to 170x170 pixels and applied a gaussian blur, so that all the detail is GONE. This means it's not recoverable, the information is just not there, it's digitally blurred: https:\/\/imgur.com\/xEyLajW\n\nAnd a 4x upscaled version so that you can better appreciate the blur: https:\/\/imgur.com\/3STX9mZ\n\n3) I full-screened the image on my monitor (showing it at 170x170 pixels, blurred), moved to the other end of the room, and turned off all the lights. Zoomed into the monitor and voila - https:\/\/imgur.com\/ifIHr3S\n\n4) This is the image I got - https:\/\/imgur.com\/bXJOZgI\n\n**INTERPRETATION**\n\nTo put it into perspective, here is a side by side: https:\/\/imgur.com\/ULVX933\n\nIn the side-by-side above, I hope you can appreciate that Samsung is leveraging an AI model to put craters and other details on places which were just a blurry mess. **And I have to stress this**: there's a difference between additional processing a la super-resolution, when multiple frames are combined to recover detail which would otherwise be lost, and this, where you have a specific AI model trained on a set of moon images, in order to recognize the moon and slap on the moon texture on it (when there is no detail to recover in the first place, as in this experiment). This is not the same kind of processing that is done when you're zooming into something else, when those multiple exposures and different data from each frame account to something. This is specific to the moon.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe moon pictures from Samsung are fake. Samsung's marketing is deceptive. It is adding detail where there is none (in this experiment, it was intentionally removed). In [this article](https:\/\/mspoweruser.com\/fake-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-moon-shots-debunked\/), they mention multi-frames, multi-exposures, but the reality is, it's AI doing most of the work, not the optics, the optics aren't capable of resolving the detail that you see. Since the moon is tidally locked to the Earth, it's very easy to train your model on other moon images and just slap that texture when a moon-like thing is detected. \n \nNow, Samsung does say \"No image overlaying or texture effects are applied when taking a photo, because that would cause similar objects to share the same texture patterns if an object detection were to be confused by the Scene Optimizer.\", which might be technically true - you're not applying any texture if you have an AI model that applies the texture as a part of the process, but in reality and without all the tech jargon, that's that's happening. It's a texture of the moon.\n\nIf you turn off \"scene optimizer\", you get the actual picture of the moon, which is a blurry mess (as it should be, given the optics and sensor that are used). \n\nTo further drive home my point, I blurred the moon even further and clipped the highlights, which means the area which is above 216 in brightness gets clipped to pure white - there's no detail there, just a white blob - https:\/\/imgur.com\/9XMgt06\n\nI zoomed in on the monitor showing that image and, guess what, again you see slapped on detail, even in the parts I explicitly clipped (made completely 100% white): https:\/\/imgur.com\/9kichAp\n\n**TL:DR**\nSamsung is using AI\/ML (neural network trained on 100s of images of the moon) to recover\/add the texture of the moon on your moon pictures, and while some think that's your camera's capability, it's actually not. And it's not sharpening, it's not adding detail from multiple frames because in this experiment, all the frames contain the same amount of detail. None of the frames have the craters etc. because they're intentionally blurred, yet the camera somehow miraculously knows that they are there. And don't even get me started on the motion interpolation on their \"super slow-mo\", maybe that's another post in the future..\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the upvotes (and awards), I really appreciate it! If you want to follow me elsewhere (since I'm not very active on reddit), here's my IG: [@ibreakphotos](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ibreakphotos\/)\n\n**EDIT2 - IMPORTANT**: New test - I photoshopped one moon next to another (to see if one moon would get the AI treatment, while another not), and managed to coax the AI to do exactly that.\n\nThis is the image that I used, which contains 2 blurred moons: https:\/\/imgur.com\/kMv1XAx\n\nI replicated my original setup, shot the monitor from across the room, and got this: https:\/\/imgur.com\/RSHAz1l\n\nAs you can see, one moon got the \"AI enhancement\", while the other one shows what was actually visible to the sensor.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678479766.0},{"title":"This looks great on paper.... - POCO X5 PRO","author":"Deskartius","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?app=desktop&v=dFFBEYDmYUY","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.48,"created_utc":1678648166.0},{"title":"Realme GT3 review","author":"filosoful","url":"https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/realme_gt3-review-2542.php","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678456432.0},{"title":"[SOLUTION] How to factory reset a Samsung device that has a completely smashed screen. Might work for non Samsung devices.","author":"MagicDanielle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11ng279\/solution_how_to_factory_reset_a_samsung_device\/","text":"TL:DR We're going to use the android talkback feature + an external keyboard to HEAR what your inputting.\n\nMy situation:\nI have my ex's android note 10 lite with a completely smashed screen that she allowed me to keep before we broke up. Now I wanna sell it, I cant with her data on it (I dont know what pictures of me are still on there). \n\nThe screen only shows black, and touch inputs dont work. Every forum post says that it's impossible to factory reset it, but I found a way so thought I'd post it here. It uses the android talkback function. \n\nWe assume that android developer options are turned off so you cant blindly hold buttons to get to the boot screen. You cant connect to PC because of whatever reason. We also assume that you know the pin number at very least.\n\nFirst a quick solution that might work:\n\nA few posts suggested using a usb c to hdmi converter and just plugging it into your tv so you can see the screen. I dont have one of these, so I have no idea if that works. You'll probably need a usb c splitter, then a usb c to usb a converter to plug in a keyboard so you can control the phone.\n\nIf it works for you, you can stop here. No need for talkback. You can now see your screen and control your phone.\n\nIf not:\nFirst find a youtube video that teaches how to factory reset your device. This is simply so you can get an idea of what each screen looks like, while combining that visual data with the audio data your phone will give you.\n\n1)From your lock screen you can hold down the two volume buttons for 3 seconds to turn on \"talkback\". Android will dictate all of your actions from this point onwards. So you can hear where you are in your phone.\n\n2) Plug in a USB C to USB A converter so you can use a keyboard. Plug in keyboard...\n\n3) Press the lock button on the phone and type in your pin\/password. When the phone unlocks, press Alt+A to enter the apps screen of android.\n\n4) Press up the up arrow key to enter the search area.\n\n5) Press the left arrow key to enter the search box. Then press enter. She will tell you that your keyboard has popped up. Ignore it, its just an indicator that you're on the right track.\n\n6) Type factory and wait for a couple of seconds for the rearch results to populate.\n\n7) Use the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard to find \"Factory data reset\". Be sure to not choose the internet search result if your phone pops one up. Scroll up and down for a bit while referencing the youtube video to get an idea of where you are.\n\n8) Listen to what she's saying as you go through the various options to get to the factory data reset.  Cross reference with youtube video to ensure you're on the right track.\n\n9) When you finally find the setting, it will ask you to input your pin. Type it in and press enter. Then after a bit more navigation it will ask you to input your samsung password. Type this in and press enter. (For those that don't know the password, like me, keep reading).\n\n10) There might be a few more options, so YMMV. I couldnt get past this bit. Congrats. Your phone is factory reset.\n\n11) If you screw up at any point (which you likely will because this is pretty fiddly) then just hammer the escape button a few times and start again.\n\nIf for some reason you cant get the factory data reset to work, if it asks for a samsung password that you dont remember, there's an option called \"Auto Factory Data reset\". This sets up your phone so that if someone submits the pincode wrong 15 times, it will factory reset your phone. This is what I had to use because although my ex and I shared pincodes, I had no reason to ever know her samsung password.\n\nFind a youtube video that shows how to turn on AUTO factory reset\n\nFollow the steps above, until...\n\n6) Type Auto Factory\n\n7) Use the up and down arrow keys to find the auto factory reset option.\n\n8) Confirm your pin code and press enter. This will allow you into this settings menu.\n\n9) Use the down key until she says \"Auto Factory Reset...[and a load of small print]\"\n\n10) Press enter. She will say \"Auto Factory Reset On\"\n\n11) Lock your phone.\n\n12) Get your pin number wrong 15 times.\n\n13) When you get to about 10 attempts, she starts making you wait 30 seconds between each attempt. Eventually you will get there and your phone will nuke itself.\n\nSo there you go. I just had to do this, and thought I would share it with you folks.\n\nThe main takeaway from this post is to use the talkback feature! Im sure this feature is good for loads of other stuff too if you have the patience.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678426639.0},{"title":"Daily Superthread (Mar 10 2023) - Your daily thread for questions, device recommendations and general discussions!","author":"curated_android","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11nn88a\/daily_superthread_mar_10_2023_your_daily_thread\/","text":"Note 1.

I didn't plan on keeping it this long, but year after year I would see what's out there and be disappointed. But my s8's screen was starting to get some burn in and I didn't want to see if it would last another year.\n\n*Stuff in the box*: S8 came with brick, wire, actually pretty good earphones, usb adapters. S23 came with a wire I'm not going to use. Idc about the brick as Im fine using the 15w brick from the S8. Samsung did not cheap out on the sim ejection pin.\n\n*Design*: Overall size difference not a big deal in my pocket. More noticeable is how super boxy the ultra is, it makes it considerably worse to hold in your hand. They also moved the volume buttons to the right side, which makes screenshots harder. There is way less bezel tho. S23 is way heavier.\n\n*Screen*: Considerably less curve, which Ig some people like. I have edge swipes turned on for back\/home and less curve makes it feel worse. Resolution is about the same, brightness is higher. It is 120hz but I don't really feel it.\n\n*Performance*: Yea its clearly faster everyday but the s8 wasn't like slow. I don't game on mobile so game performance not a huge deal. 3x the ram is great. Web speed is an interesting one as the s8 was slow even when it was new. S23 is a lot faster and seems quite a bit faster than pixel7 and s22. Unfortunately, it's still on the slow side compared to iPhone, and now vs 2017, macs and some PCs are getting fast too. Biggest improvement is app install speed is insane compared to the s8 and even most other phones I've used. Its near instant.\n\n*Camera*: 200MP, multiple huge sensors, eh. Zoom is really nice but not as good as I was hoping. Overall quality is great but doesnt feel like 6 years worth of great. Night speed is better, astro isnt that hot. Autofocus is complete garbage, ridiculously bad vs the S8. Struggles pretty much everywhere and it's really sad as Samsung autofocus used to be the best. They made a huge deal about quadfocus, and I wondered why they didn't say it had dualpixel af. Its cuz it doesn't have it. Not even talking about the shutterlag, the take your phone out and shoot experience is so much worse because of the autofocus.\n\n*Software*: Android 9 to 13. I love that I dont have to think about material you. Its just in gmail. I was told fb messenger chat heads were dead in new phones but mine is still the old design, which is great. Im using Nova still (yea ik, but it has tabs in the app drawer and gestures on home) so my daily exp is really the same. Overall nothing really changed which is actually good because I was worried about googles design choices.\n\n*Battery*: Crazy how good the s8's battery was after 6 years, the Ultra's battery life is even crazier. I almost dont have to think about charging. This is one of the reasons Im keeping that 15w brick.\n\n*Fun Features*: S23 loses ... headphone jack (I bought a few adapters to see which ones are good) - huge issue for me. I have $300 sennheiser wireless earbuds, but wire is fast, convenient and sounds better. I hope jacks come back as a luxury feature. Sd card - I have 512gb of storage so its not affecting me .. yet. But what did I gain from them leaving it out? MST - samsung pay on s8 works everywhere, s23 is just like a normal phone. Iris sensor - the ultra's fingerprint isn't good, face unlock doesn't work in the dark or with a mask. Fake home button - I thought I would miss this, but I don't. Led notification light - horrible decision to drop this and not provide a good replacement. AOD doesn't replace it and the third-party apps are not good enough. Side by side the s8's light makes it feel so much more premium. The ultra has a pen which I don't use, and I wouldn't care cuz some people would want it, but it takes up so much space in the phone. How many people would want more battery or a pen.\n\n*Value*: MSRP $1379 vs $849. Both preorders, Samsung switched from giving free gear vr to free storage upgrade. I paid less for the Ultra then I did for the S8, no trade in required. $600 + 10.25% tax + 4 months of service on Fi is less than the S8.\n\n**TLDR**: Very rough for 6 years of improvements. Samsung still wins cuz I still got upgraded. Or did they lose cuz I had no problem upgrading every 2 years. I'm an enthusiast, I post on r\/android regularly, I have new phone money, I should be excited about new flagships. I hope Samsung or anyone really releases a good phone next year, so I can trade this in.\n\nIf anyone would like to defend Samsung's honor or tell me I should have bought so and so, go for it.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678130210.0},{"title":"Huawei suspected of tracking MWC23 visitors","author":"kfthebest97","url":"https:\/\/www.lightreading.com\/security\/huawei-suspected-of-tracking-mwc23-visitors\/d\/d-id\/783616","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678126695.0},{"title":"Using Tasker to talk with ChatGPT on your phone looks equal parts powerful and terrifying","author":"exu1981","url":"https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/chatgpt-tasker-android-integration\/?newsletter_popup=1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677906244.0},{"title":"Google Keep\u2019s new Android widget makes it easier to check off items on your to-do list","author":"GL4389","url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/2\/27\/23614281\/google-keep-single-note-widget-checklist-interactive","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677901641.0},{"title":"The Sketchy Plan to Build a Russian Android Phone","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/russia-ncc-phone-android-sanctions\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1677967245.0},{"title":"Android 15's dessert name is \"Vanilla Ice Cream\"","author":"MishaalRahman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11hdx7k\/android_15s_dessert_name_is_vanilla_ice_cream\/","text":"It's a bit earlier than usual (Android 14's code-name was found out in late April 2022), but it seems the internal dessert code-name for Android 15 V has just been revealed: \"Vanilla Ice Cream\".

So far it has lasted 2 days of usage.\n\nFeel free to ask questions","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677782829.0},{"title":"Cerberus Lock Screen Protector - Making Lock Screen To Properly Lock The Device","author":"PaveThePAHA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11hwskl\/cerberus_lock_screen_protector_making_lock_screen\/","text":"\\---   \nFirst, the link to app itself for those either already well-educated on this matter or otherwise aren't interested in the backgrounds:   \n[https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.lsdroid.lsp](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.lsdroid.lsp)   \nPrivacy Policy-page for those concerned:   \n[https:\/\/www.cerberusapp.com\/lsp\\_privacy.html](https:\/\/www.cerberusapp.com\/lsp_privacy.html)   \n   \nFor those unaware, pretty much all non-custom Android-OSes (especially \"Android One\") have never properly locked your phone (screen) when \"Screen Lock\" has been activated.   \nThis is something that has been made not-enough-noise about at the very least since year-2013:   \n[https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/36972911](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/36972911)   \nIn summary:   \nYou have been always able to access the power-menu and fiddle with the most important tracking \/ theft-recovery-related quick-settings-tiles (\"Do Not Disturb, Airplane-mode, Hotspot, Mobile-Data, etc.\") while the screen \/ phone has been \"locked\". \n\nAnother person from where I first read about \"Cerberus Lock Screen Protector\"-app has also linked \/ documented on this matter:   \n[https:\/\/techblog.bozho.net\/a-security-issue-in-android-that-remains-unfixed-pull-down-menu-on-lock-screen\/](https:\/\/techblog.bozho.net\/a-security-issue-in-android-that-remains-unfixed-pull-down-menu-on-lock-screen\/)   \nIf the comment-section of that blog-post is to be believed, this page was also the inspiration to \"Luca \/ LSDroid\" to release \/ rip-away this (proper) screen locker from their software-suite. \n\nThe screenshots of app-store-page are slightly misleading:   \nAside for the microsecond until the unlocking-screen is displayed, this app works more like a \"auto-switcher\" than than a button-disabler.   \nSo if you pull-down while in lock-screen, you are presented with the unlock-screen or occasionally it simply auto-screen-offs;   \nassumption is same happens if one tries to hardware-shutdown the device ( power + Volume-down for 5-seconds, or something like that ).   \nFor reference, I am running this on \"Nokia XR20 (Android One 13)\".   \n   \nSo yeah, I for one am surprised how this whole thing has \"flown under the radar\" and this app hasn't yet gotten more popular yet all things considered.   \nSo hopefully someone else finds this \"should has been baked-in from get-go\"-solution useful.   \n \\---","upvote_ratio":0.49,"created_utc":1677928094.0},{"title":"Daily Superthread (Mar 03 2023) - Your daily thread for questions, device recommendations and general discussions!","author":"curated_android","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11gyxtp\/daily_superthread_mar_03_2023_your_daily_thread\/","text":"Note 1.

This came free with my Galaxy S23 pre-order this year.\n*  In car, my phone charges itself when connected to Android Auto head unit with a USB cable at speed of 5W which is actually good because it doesn't heat the phone.\n\nHence since 2018, I have not purchased any new charger and there is no issue in everyday life.\n\nThis has taken a few years to happen but seem to have happened. I just want the governing bodies to force OEMs to use USB Power Delivery standards instead of propriety charging standards like Vooc etc. \n\nAt least for me, this has actually led to reduction in e-waste because now I am able to reuse my old chargers with new devices just fine all thanks to USB Power Delivery standard.\n\nAnd for cables, I have a bunch of braided USB cable both Type C and Type A and I don't use bundled cables which come in the box so again, I haven't purchased a new cable in 5 years.\n\nEdit : I didn't want this topic to become so controversial.","upvote_ratio":0.49,"created_utc":1677916215.0},{"title":"Daily Superthread (Mar 02 2023) - Your daily thread for questions, device recommendations and general discussions!","author":"curated_android","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/11g10l0\/daily_superthread_mar_02_2023_your_daily_thread\/","text":"Note 1.

Should be a recent release (2022-2023)\n\n2. Price cap at $300, anything past that and anything that's below $200 is ignored \n\n3. 8GB RAM or more\n\n4. A minimum of at least 4000mAh Battery\n\n5. There should be a Headphone Jack, imagine buying an incomplete phone  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nResearch Process:  \n\nFirst step is forming a list of outliers that'd commonly appear on the searches; Googling 2022 best phones, and then slipping-in budget in the middle right after reading through the top articles and see if there's any budget phones that got in on the former results. Right after that, watching Smartphone Awards of established Tech Youtubers such as: MKBHD, Mrwhoseboss, JerryRig (if you want to find out the device's durability). After that, I did my own phone searching by using GSM Arena site's phone finder\u2014search filters used is pretty much the criteria above. Then match and compared all of the findings with the \"AnTuTu Benchmark 9\" ratings on Nanoreview's site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResults List: \n\n\\-Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro\n\n\\-Poco X3 Pro\n\n\\-Infinix Zero (2023)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best one in the list overall bench mark ratings-wise is the first one: Redmi Note 12 Pro, 6-12GB RAM, 128\/256GB Storage, Dimensity 1080 Chip, 5000mAh Battery. The sweet spot of 8GB RAM + 128GB ROM is priced at exactly $299 at my place currently.\n\n  \n\nAlthough, the other 2 is very close and it all comes down to your preferences. An example would be that Poco X3 Pro is actually better in terms of Gaming performance but is only bested by RN12 Pro with its superior Display quality and better network Connectivity, considering the X3 Pro is a year older. And Infinix Zero 2023 is only slightly worse than the RN12 Pro on the camera aspect, which means if you're someone who doesn't really mind the camera quality aspect that much then it's actually the better one because aside from the almost the same Gaming, Battery and Connectivity performance, it comes with a 256GB storage + it has an SD card slot capability for an even larger storage, which is really really good if you're someone who downloads movies\/series like me.  \n  \nAnyways, any of the 3 is a bang for the buck below $300 value phone if you're someone who doesn't want to spend $500+ for an Asus Zenfone 9\/Pixel 7\/Oneplus 10 Pro.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1676753432.0},{"title":"Original Oxygen OS team joins Noting- Carl Pei","author":"welp_im_damned","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/getpeid\/status\/1626182153028657154?t=R3J79AIC_KY9ThFjQNvvQA&s=09","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676681610.0},{"title":"Google engineer plans 3GPP Release 16 5G as an Android U feature for the Pixel 7 and Pixel 8","author":"Starks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/115h06r\/google_engineer_plans_3gpp_release_16_5g_as_an\/","text":"The Pixel 7 doesn't support 3GPP Release 16 5G features like practically every other 2022 flagship.

As for today we have a conflict of interests between solution providers (Gamepad\/Handhelds producers) and end users. For example Mantis Gamepad Pro software or Razer Kishi V2 Virtual Controller requires too wide permissions, because these can't be granulated (in one cases this is overlay permission and usb debugging - also remotely - and in second is a full control over device via the accessibility feature). They claim that they use permissions only for one purpose and they won't do any harm to you. However it would be better to not depend of such statements, but just provide the permissions which they actually need - drawing some overlays and triggering touch events.

If I'm on T-Mobile they will only ask the T-Mobile server to verify the IMEI number and that is not in their database even though it is active on their network.\n\nThese are the steps to get a carrier to add and unlocked phones IMEI to their sold phone database so that Samsung can verify it and you can trade it in.\n\nThis is the message that I sent to T-Mobile and they resolved the issue and only two days. Great service from them. I know that AT&T also has a process like this one. Verizon used to not but they might now.\n\nMessage:\n\nI need help with the IMEI verification on the T-Mobile server. I have an unlocked phone on the T-Mobile network. I have attached the devices info and can authenticate it. I am trying to trade in my s21 ultra and upgrade to magenta max and purchase a T-Mobile branded s23 ultra on [http:\/\/Samsung.com](http:\/\/samsung.com\/) with the trade in. Samsung is failing to verify the IMEI number because it is not on T-Mobile's server for devices sold locked to T mobile. The device I am trying to trade in was purchased unlocked from samsung. The device is now active on the T-Mobile network, but T-Mobile has not added the IMEI to the database. Samsung support is refusing to check the IMEI on their own server. hey only have the option to check it on the T-Mobile server. I need my IMEI number of the s21 ultra active on your network to be added to the database in order to proceed with the upgrade. You can do this by referencing Internal Document 415133. Even though I am not unlocking the phone through T-Mobile like the document references, Samsung claims that this is the only way to add the IMEI to your database and solely the responsibility of T-Mobile as my carrier.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676257436.0},{"title":"Galaxy S23 Series Unveiled!

TRIED GETTING IT BELOW 40,000 CHARACTERS FOR REDDIT.\n\nHello all. I made a post a few months back on [r\/GalaxyFold](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GalaxyFold\/) about a Z Fold 4 review. It took me a while to get it together. Let's drive some discussion!\n\n# Introduction:\n\nHello everyone. I am Salikar and I like tech, especially mobile phones. This endeavor is to engage in written reviews and experiences about devices that I personally bought and used. I\u2019ll try to focus more on experience and opinions rather than just stating the obvious.\n\nThe purpose of this write up is to review the Z Fold 4 coming from someone who adores foldables. I will also attempt to disseminate and provide commentary and certain common foldable critiques that I see on Twitter, Reddit and YouTube - some are warranted, and some are down right exaggerated and overly dramatic.\n\n# Smartphone history:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S2\n\nSony Xperia Z\n\nSony Xperia Z2\n\nSony Xperia Z5 Premium\n\nGoogle Nexus 6P\n\nMotorola Moto Z\n\nHTC 10\n\nSony Xperia XZ\n\nGoogle Pixel XL\n\nZTE Axon 7 Mini\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8\n\nApple iPhone X\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9\n\n**Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G (favorite phone)**\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G\n\n**Google Pixel 6 (least favorite phone)**\n\nSamsung Galaxy S22\n\n**Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 (work phone)**\n\n**Huawei Mate 50 Pro (personal phone as of December 20th, 2022)**\n\n**Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra (coming soon!)**\n\nMy phone history has strictly been Android. I was heavy into rooting and flashing mods on my phones early and ever since then I stuck to Android and tried to experience different manufacturers with different takes on hardware and software. Ever since the Snapdragon 810 overheating debacle I left Sony Xperia because their rebranding to the \u201cX\u201d lineup was mediocre in my opinion and tried different manufacturers, some experiences being so short and unpleasant the devices don\u2019t belong to the list. I settled on Samsung as to me they seem to have the most compelling hardware\/software combo out there in the Android scene, and are really the only foldable phone option available where I live.\n\n# Exterior: A- | Great improvement over Z Fold 3.\n\n**Casing and Buttons**\n\nPhone is made out of aluminum sides that are glossy as opposed to last year\u2019s more matte sides. Different from last year is the flatness of the sides compared to the more rounded sides of last year\u2019s. Even though the Fold 4 is thinner by specifications, it \u201cfeels\u201d thicker as you are touching more of it on the sides. This also extends to the hinge itself, where the Fold 4\u2019s hinge \u201cflattens\u201d out and curves more aggressively than its predecessor, resulting in a more grippy device. This \u201cflattening\u201d of the hardware is extended throughout the display as well which will be discussed in the next section. The glossy sides however, do attract a bit more fingerprints, which is a minor issue for me at the gym when I sweat. A benefit to the glossy sides though is the lack of chipping that you are likely going to experience when dropping or scratching the phone. My Fold 3 loved to shed its color on the frame like a snake shedding its skin whenever it got scratched. Can\u2019t say the same about the Fold 4, which is an unintentional, but appreciated plus.\n\nThe button placements are identical on the Fold 4 and Fold 3, with the Fold 4 having more clickiness to them. Even though the buttons feel more clicky, I still prefer the Fold 3\u2019s buttons as their sound is deeper and less hollow, while also maintaining a more rigid feel. The volume buttons on the Fold 4 require a bit more force to press than last year\u2019s, but not by all that much. The fingerprint sensor on the Fold 4 is a tiny bit more loose than its predecessor, but that is just me splitting hairs and isn\u2019t something you\u2019d notice unless you\u2019re looking for it. A Fold 4 surprise to me is the USB C port at the bottom, which \u201cholds\u201d cables much more firmly than any other phone I have. It gives me an extra reassurance of its longevity even though I am more of a wireless charging kind of guy.\n\nOne thing to note about the casing is that the seams between different parts of the phone are smaller, and more refined overall. This is noticeable in the gap between the outer screen and the casing, where the Fold 4 has a significantly smaller gap than the Fold 3. The curve of that part of the exterior is also smoother, making it nicer to swipe over. The same can be said when the phones are flipped over, the frame meeting the hinge has a much smaller gap on the Fold 4, and again is smoother to swipe over. I would wager this is part Samsung improving their manufacturing quality on the Folds in general, and part being that the wider back panel glass forces that frame-hinge gap to be smaller, also making it less noticeable to the touch.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Frame-hinge section is thinner on Z Fold 4 (right), smoother to the touch, and \"tighter\" to the rest of the exterior compared to the Z Fold 3 (left)*\n\n**Hinge**\n\nWell what can I say, I am torn on this one. On one side the hinge feels more sturdy than the Fold 3, but it also sacrifices some smoothness. The Fold 4 feels like it has 2 \u201cnotches\u201d where the hinge suddenly \u201cloosens\u201d. The first notch is at 90 degrees, aka Flex Mode, where I found the Fold 4 to maintain and hold the Flex Mode angle better than the Fold 3, which is a huge plus for me at the gym setting up Flex Mode on YouTube to better suit the weird elliptical and treadmill angles. The second notch is closer towards opening it flat, where the Fold 4 reaches a point where it just wants to force itself to stay flat open, akin to most foldables from the videos that I have seen. Even though the Fold 3 possesses a similar behavior, the change in force to operate the hinge in the Fold 3 is much less than the Fold 4, making it a smoother experience with the hinge. The Fold 4\u2019s hinge also feels more weighted, giving it a more premium feel when folding and unfolding. If the notchiness wasn\u2019t there I would hands down say the Fold 4 is the clear superior hinge. If any of you had a Surface Book laptop, you\u2019d know what I mean when it comes to \u201cweighted\u201d hinges. The Fold 4\u2019s closing sound feels like heaven compared to the Fold 3. You know that moment when you take a shit and it comes out smoothly with no pressure required only to appreciate it more when you realize it leaves no mark when you wipe? That is exactly how I would describe the Fold 4\u2019s folding shut sound. It has an \u201cexecutive\u201d motion to it. The Fold 3 has a more slapping your homey\u2019s skinny ass type of sound. Overall I am impressed by the hinge, I just hope it maintains it for the duration of ownership. The Fold 3 got a bit loose during my ownership but maintained its smoothness.\n\n**Weight Distribution**\n\nArguably the least appreciated difference gen-to-gen. The Fold 3 is a more top heavy device, which made it feel heavier than it really was folded or unfolded, portrait or landscape. No more! The Fold 4\u2019s has a much much improved weight distribution, and is extremely well balanced. You truly feel it while holding both of them side by side, and that difference is even more felt when they are both unfolded. As a result the Fold 4 feels much lighter than the Fold 3, which is a nice improvement, especially when setting up the Fold 4 unfolded on a car mount. The Fold 4 is just a noticeable refinement over the Fold 3 in this regard, and I do not know why people on the sub don\u2019t really mention it. My guess is that the top heaviness of the Fold 3 is offsetted by the cases people use. The phone is still heavier and thicker than your average glass slab, so you will feel it in your pocket if you\u2019re a skinny jeans type of guy or girl. It was an issue with Fold 3 at the gym but I started wearing basketball shorts with those deep ass pockets so it is fine for the most part.\n\n# Display: A | Outer display greatly improved. Inner display minor improved.\n\n**Outer Screen**\n\nOne of the common issues with Fold 3 was the outer screen being too narrow. This was an issue for me mainly due to the fucking typos I had. It was horrendous. It was literally impossible for my fat finger ass to type 3 words without making at least 2 typos with that shit of a screen. Fold 4 fixes that, the outer screen is wide enough for me to type a sentence or two without typos one handed or two handed. It is such a minor increase (3mm iirc) but it makes a world of difference to day-to-day experience.\n\nThe wider screen isn\u2019t the biggest improvement however. In my opinion the biggest improvement is the color consistency between the outer and inner screen. On the Fold 3, the outer screen was less saturated and vibrant than the inner screen. It felt like it had some sort of green\/blue hue to it, specially on lower brightness settings (no I am not referring to the green tint that a lot of oled displays exhibit). The Fold 4\u2019s outer screen is way more consistent alongside the inner screen, with matching brightness and calibration.\n\nBrightness is more than adequate, and the screen reflectivity is slightly improved over last year. A minor improvement is the presence of an oleophobic coating on the outer screen, which was nonexistent on the Fold 3 due to the screen protector. The Fold 4 loses the screen protector, but the screen feels more slick and more fingerprint repellant. The screen also gets really dim, which is greatly appreciated at night.\n\nDifferent from its predecessor is the more flat screen that I referred to above in the exterior part. The Fold 3 had a curve starting from the bezels, which made finger swipes feel smooth as your finger traces the curve. This was, however, an issue as it accumulated most of the scratches and presented weak points if the screen were to fall. The Fold 4 has a flatter outer screen, and as a result you can feel the frame as your finger glides over. The edge isn\u2019t sharp by any means, just something that is noticeably different. I prefer the flat display over the slightly curved one due to the reflections that stick along the edges. The gap between the panel and the frame is more uniform, which is a nice refinement. Overall, no real complaints about the screen.\n\n**Inner Screen**\n\nThere are 3 main improvements to the inner screen compared to last year. The most obvious one is the aspect ratio change. I like it alot, especially for my use case. Websites appear more friendly in portrait mode now than on the Fold 3 which kind of led me to always go landscape when browsing, and e-books are more enjoyable to read now as more words fit in one line in a two-column setup.\n\nThe second improvement, akin to the outer screen, is the overall quality of the panel. The colors are more vibrant, black crushing, which was evident in low brightness in the Fold 3 have been greatly improved, while also maintaining a slightly brighter and slightly dimmer ends of the brightness spectrum. The white balance on the Fold 4 sways less towards cool than the Fold 3, which means that in the display settings I only have to move the white balance bar one notch towards \u201cwarm\u201d instead of two notches. The crease has also improved but not by much. It is way less noticeable when looking at the screen from an angle, and swiping over it isn\u2019t as bad as the Fold 3. I personally never found the crease to be a bother, with the only exception being the strong light reflections when watching videos in flex mode, but I guess that is a trade-off I am willing to endure for a more comfortable viewing experience. The same can be said for the Under Panel Camera (UPC or UDC). The pixel density over the sensor has been increased which makes it less noticeable. The Fold 3\u2019s UPC was noticeable in white backgrounds but wasn\u2019t distracting. The Fold 4\u2019s is harder to notice and is less distracting.\n\nThe third and biggest improvement to the panel, which may have been part of the exterior section above to be fair, is the plastic inner frame that surrounds the inner screen. OMG when I tell you how much of an improvement it is. For starters the frame is thinner and shorter, which brings the screen closer to you. It feels closer to swiping on the outer screen than swiping on a depressed screen protected by the frame. With that, swiping towards the frame doesn\u2019t cause your finger or nail to stop at the seam between the screen and frame, but rather makes your finger glide over it without feeling a sharp edge. To me it speaks as if Samsung is more confident with the screen quality, and isn\u2019t afraid to make it seem less \u201cprotected\u201d.\n\nOk **mini-rant**\u00a0time. To me I never found the screen fragile on the Fold lineup. It feels more like glass than plastic imo, with the exception of the fingerprint magnet situation. I have roughened up the Fold 3 and it has been perfect. No damage at all, while using it in freezing temperatures in NYC or the blazing sun of Phoenix, to the tops of the Colorado hike-trails down to the sunny Los Angeles beaches. It had no issues at all. I feel like reviewers don\u2019t really take the time to experience the devices and rely mainly on the shock factor of \u201comg you can damage the screen with your nail if you press too hard\u201d. Well yeah, I can drown myself in an oreo milkshake if I had enough of it. I had this discussion with a few of my friends, and my response has always been to unfold the Fold 3 and run my fingernail on it like scratching a scratch-ticket with a coin while also tapping on it. People really need to be realistic with what is being said and what is being experienced. Little \u201ctech-journalist\u201d Jimmy takes 20 pictures, looks at screen-on time and gives you a review with no concrete experiences as they got sponsors to please I guess.These people review so many phones that it is hard to give each phone a fair and most importantly, realistic review. This is not to say that the inner screen is as solid as current glass slabs phones, but it also isn\u2019t going to scratch itself if you blink at it twice. The overreaction I see in comment sections and reddit is honestly sad, and makes it hard to have an actual discussion.\n\n# Camera: B | Capable and versatile with a couple of annoyances.\n\nOk. So instead of going into detail about the camera set, I\u2019d rather focus on the experience of using them. Cameras aren't the most important thing on a phone to me, even though it is what differentiates phones most nowadays since phones are pretty good in everything else. All the pictures I took included personal information\/ people so sharing them is not possible, but I do not feel like there is more I can add compared to the dozens of albums reviewers have online.\n\n1. **Pictures**\n\n**The Great**\n\n* Dynamic range\n* White balance\n* Detail\n* Zoom performance\n* Night mode\n* Portrait shots\n* Warping on Ultra Wide sensor\n\n**The Good**\n\n* Color consistency between lenses\n* Lens-flare management\n* Fringe management\n* Focus\n* Selfie camera\n\n**The Meh**\n\n* Indoor shots\n* Artificial light source shots\n* Over smoothening at night\n* Occasional overexposure even in daylight\n\n**The Bad**\n\n* Long shutter speed\n* Under panel camera\n* Lack of autofocus on ultra wide camera and selfie cameras\n\n**What to Improve**\n\nThere are a few things to be improved with the Z Fold 4. Two of those things are traced to multiple Samsung flagship smartphones for a few years now, with no signs of actually being addressed; the long shutter speed, and the overexposure issue. The long shutter speed is the most talked about one for obvious reasons; it makes taking pictures of any moving subject a nightmare in less than broad daylight scenarios. Indoors or in low light scenarios taking pictures is a pain as the camera doesn\u2019t respect motion. Samsung tends to prioritize lowering noise by cratering the iso and increasing the shutter speed to compensate. This tends to be an overreaction imo, as not only are the sensor sizes large, the aperture is also wide enough to let in enough light, but yet Samsung still maintains its noise reduction preference at the expense of blurry shots. I personally tend to avoid that by taking burst shots but taking 30 pics and selecting 1 isn\u2019t the ideal situation when eating dinner in a dimly lit restaurant. You also lose a lot of the post-processing with burst mode, leading to a somewhat noisy album.\n\nAlso, Samsung has to tune the way it handles artificial lights. If you take pictures mainly in artificial lighting, especially if those lights are neon lights akin to what you find in Asian cities or in Chinatown districts and such, you will be disappointed. The combination of the overexposure, long shutter speed, and smoothening that the camera applies in night time will lead to your red neon lights looking more whitish, with evident haloing around the light source. The same applies to non-neon light sources, where haloing, overexposure, and smoothening ruin the mood that is generally expected in these scenarios. Taking the exposure lower does help preserve the \u201cneon-ness\u201d but will darken the rest of the image, making it look overly edited and processed. This is arguably the worst shooting environment for Samsung devices, as they are more frequent, at least in my experience, than shooting moving subjects. YMMV.\n\nThe Under Panel Camera (UPC) needs to have its quality improved. As it currently stands, you will certainly never use it to take photos ever, as every image looks like it has been covered in cum. It is overly smooth and has terrible details, while lacking autofocus which is unfortunate. The front display\u2019s camera is quite capable, and has great color, dynamic range with decent detail. You cannot, however, zoom using the outer front camera, and it lacks autofocus as well. It is meh at best.\n\nLastly, the thing that annoys me most, is the overexposure in certain scenarios. It truly is bothersome. I mean just look at the keyboard shots below and you will see what I am talking about; both shots are taken with the same settings and focus point with the only exception being that on one of the shots, the exposure bar was reduced by about 50%. Needless to say, the one on the left is overexposed, giving a flatter look to the image, while the one on the right is more true to life, with better color reproduction. I think their approach is more appropriate to the Asian markets, where every manufacturer slightly overexposes the image to give off a brighter look, which is preferred in that region. Unfortunately, this comes off as being an overall drawback in my opinion.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Portrait shots are great. Look at my parrot! Nice separation between the parrot and the background while missing a small part under its beak and over its head. Also notice the blurriness in its torso due to the longer shutter speed. The one on the right is the same but I used the object-eraser feature on the feather on his beak, I think it turned out good.*\n\n2. **Videos**\n\n**The Great**\n\n* Dynamic range\n* Audio (turn audio-zoom on!!!)\n* Stabilization\n\n**The Good**\n\n* Zoom\n* Detail\n* Focus\n\n**The Meh**\n\n* The consistency between lens options\n* Handling smooth transition in sudden light shifts\n* Selfie video\n* 8K recording\n* Noise handling at lowlight\n\n**The Bad**\n\n* None comes to mind\n\n**What to Improve**\n\nA few things to improve on video but overall very satisfactory. I think one thing that Samsung has to generally do is to improve features it already has implemented in the past. An example is the \u201csuper stabilization\u201d mode which I believe was first introduced in the S20 lineup. This feature used to crop into the ultra wide sensor to provide stabilization and while the Fold 3 introduced the ability to do so with the main sensor, it is still limited to 1080p. Furthermore, the 1080p60fps is only limited to the main lens on super stabilization mode, while the ultra wide is still limited to 30 fps. Please make this available on 4K Samsung. Another example is the audio zoom, it is exactly the same as the Fold 3 with no improvement at all. The feature itself is really good and the audio quality is top notch, but they can stand to implement perhaps a better noise or wind cancellation algorithm to audio zoom. Recording in 8K falls under the same criticism. It hasn\u2019t really improved from when I tried it previously and I wish Samsung would pay attention and improve these already existing features.\n\nOne consistent issue though is the harsh transitioning in suddenly varying lighting. This is best illustrated if you were riding a bike with the phone filming and you suddenly turn from a dimly lit alley to a well lit street. The phone adapting to the sudden increase of light is extremely sudden and isn\u2019t done so smoothly. As a result the video playback hurts from this, and is something that is present in previous Samsung flagships too.\n\nAnother issue which was introduced by OEM\u2019s putting more lenses in is the issue of lens switching. To my knowledge, only Apple smoothly transitions between lenses during video recording, to ensure that the framing of what you\u2019re shooting remains consistent across all lenses. Samsung has to improve this; and even though this may not seem like the biggest of deals, the jarring lens switching while recording video couples with the color science varying between the lenses mean that the video playback looks weird and poorly stitched together. Another complaint is the fact that the lenses don\u2019t all have access to the same options. Object tracking auto focus doesn\u2019t exist in the ultra wide lens since it doesn\u2019t have auto focus to begin with, and the wide angle lens cannot record in 60fps in either 1080p or 4k resolutions. Also, once you start recording at 4k60fps with the main camera, you cannot zoom in to the tele-photo and vice versa, even though both cameras are capable of 4k60fps. So the only way to switch\u00a0lenses while video recording is to record at 30fps, which is a bummer.\n\n# Software: A- | A sprinkle of Samsung, good and bad.\n\nMy favorite part of Samsung phones, One UI. Gone are the laggy fuckfest that was Touchwiz or as I used to call it Touchjizz, and instead we are greeted with a smoother, more modern take on phone UI. With that redesign Samsung has put an emphasis on making the phone \u201ctruly yours\u201d, integrating practicality in the form of seamless integration with Windows through \u201cLink to Windows\u201d and Onedrive, which allows syncing of your gallery, and integrating a more colorful and playful interface seen in the Weather animations, and themes available through the Galaxy Store. Below I am going to highlight some first party apps and One UI features that I always use with every Samsung phone.\n\n**Samsung Email**\n\nOne of my favorite first party apps imo, it supports split screen, drag and drop, resizable two-column view like no other email client that I tried, and is certainly better than GMail when it comes to foldables.\n\n**My Files**\n\nThe built in file manager is extremely useful. My favorite feature is the fact that I can sign into my Onedrive and GDrive accounts to manage all the files through it in a single fashion. As someone that works with multiple cloud storage platforms, this is greatly appreciated. My recommendation is for them to integrate more cloud storage platforms like Dropbox and Box.\n\n**Samsung Health**\n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this app so much. It is the only app that really got me motivated to keep better tracking of my health, specially with counting calories and steps. The interface is easy to use, but it does come with a couple of annoyances. Even though I appreciate Samsung putting in recommended articles to read about health and diet in general, a lot of the sources and sites used are questionable at best, and almost seem like a Buzzfeed clickbaity strip of links that\u2019s just a trap to get into. Another annoyance is the limitation associated with inserting calories. There is no barcode scanner like on MyFitnessPal, and that is something that Samsung should heavily consider adding, since I have already reached the limit on the custom amount of food items in my database. Samsung Health used to be able to sync data with MyFitnessPal, but that feature has been killed off a couple of years ago which makes me rely on two separate apps completely.\n\n**Samsung Internet**\n\nYou knew this was coming. A browser with abilities to have an ad-blocker plug-in installed that is light, quick and customizable? Sign me up. I like how it acknowledges that the link that I am opening can be viewed within a compatible app installed on the phone, meaning that twitter or tiktok links that sometimes don\u2019t always open directly to the app will still give you the option to open that same page within the app installed on the phone, a truly underrated feature.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThere are avenues for improvement though. For starters, I would love to see a built in VPN akin to the one you\u2019d find on Opera. Next, I would like to see a desktop version of it to aid in the syncing between devices. Lastly, autofill in the omnibar that behaves similarly to Chrome would be better than the auto-suggestion only approach.\n\n**One Hand** **Operation+**\n\nA module used with Goodlock, this app is single handedly the reason why I always have to keep a Samsung device within my reach. It makes gesture control and navigation so much easier with the ability to increase the touch registration area and allowing you to be in control of how gestures behave when the phone is in landscape mode (landscape mode gestures always have annoyed me, especially on YouTube).\n\n**Separate App Sound**\n\nThe least talked about feature on Samsung devices. This feature allows you to play audio through your phone while it is simultaneously playing every other sound through a connected bluetooth speaker. When I first used this feature in a house party to show a friend of mine something on Snapchat, they literally had to understand exactly how Snapchat wasn\u2019t playing through the entire speaker system. One of my most loved features and definitely one that would love to see highlighted in reviews.\n\n**Adapt sound**\n\nThis is one of those \u201clife changing\u201d features if you could call it that. I suffer from tinnitus, which is a constant ringing audible in my ears; with the left one being affected more so than the right. This naturally makes it harder to hear certain frequencies. With Adapt Sound, a series of tones and beeps are played through the connected bluetooth earbuds, prompting you to confirm whether or not you were able to hear the tone. Answering no boosts the volume of the frequencies you couldn\u2019t hear. Not only does this make music much more enjoyable to listen to, but it makes my constant fiddling with volumes to accentuate certain parts of tracks less frequent. My only complaint with it is that for some reason the custom profile you setup is not backed up by the phone or transferable to your new phone with Smart Switch, meaning that with every Samsung phone you get, you will have to set the profile again from scratch.\n\n\\*PLEASE MAKE THE CUSTOM PROFILES TRANSFERABLE WITH SMART SWITCH SAMSUNG!!!\\*\ud83d\udcf7\n\nEven though the Samsung suite of apps are capable, there are certain annoyances of some of their apps and services that I have not mentioned above. These annoyances illustrate an underlying theme of some of Samsung\u2019s software and service struggles.\n\nFor starters, let us begin with the integration between Samsung phones and tablets. I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ and I have the **Call and Text on Other Devices**\u00a0feature toggled on which allows me to receive messages and make phone calls with my tablet. This feature works great but I wish the seamless integration is taken a bit further. For instance, swiping away a notification on my phone from Samsung Email will not dismiss the notification on my tablet, and vice versa. The same can be extended to notifications regarding signing into your Samsung account, where a multi-day old prompt that has been addressed through your phone will remain on your tablet unless you manually interact and dismiss it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only example where device-device integration is a bit off. I have signed in with Microsoft Account on my Samsung phone during setup however, when using the **Link to Windows**\u00a0to connect to my PC it prompted me to sign into my Microsoft Account again for some reason. You\u2019d think that with Samsung integrating Microsoft\u2019s suite into its devices that something like this would not be an issue but unfortunately it was. Even though it is a one-time setup, it shouldn\u2019t be something that you should be doing anyways.\n\nFurthermore, the management of peripherals connected to the phone can be improved. Currently, Samsung uses **Smartthings**\u00a0for its IoT and SmartTags, and **Galaxy Wearables** for its Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Buds offerings. In my opinion, there is no reason for the wearables app to exist and it should be integrated into Smartthings. This is something that hit me after using my Huawei Mate 50 Pro, where its **AI Life** app allows full control of all first party peripherals connected to the phone, including the Huawei Freebuds 2 Pro I generally use with it. Even though my Galaxy Buds Pro shows in the Smartthings app, a tap on the earphones within the app will refer you to use the Galaxy Wearable app to change the EQ or ANC settings.\n\nNext, I would like to discuss **Samsung Pass**, Samsung\u2019s own password manager. Samsung Pass used to be the shit when I first used it on my Galaxy S8 as it was the only password manager in my experience at that time that worked with every single app that I used, including ones that were supposedly not updated for biometrics authentication. Google\u2019s own autofill offering at that time didn\u2019t work on any of my banking and brokerage applications, and even in apps that supported Google\u2019s implementation, the popup would sometimes not show up for some reason. Samsung Pass was the one that worked on every banking app even those that didn\u2019t officially announce support, which made it a killer feature. Fast forward to today and the Google offering works perfectly with the synced passwords that I have in Chrome, making me juggle between Samsung and Google\u2019s offerings for some instances. This isn\u2019t that much of an issue personally but there are hugely missed opportunities for Samsung in this space. First, Samsung has to play nicely when it comes to importing and exporting passwords. Most password managers allow the export of passwords in \u201c.csv\u201d or \u201c.json\u201d formats, making it feasible to transfer between services, however Samsung Pass exports and imports only in its proprietary \u201c.spass\u201d format, making it impossible to get anything into it from my 100\u2019s of saved passwords in Chrome. I reckon it has to do with Samsung Knox security and how it has to abide by whatever Knox decides. Samsung Pass also doesn\u2019t give you the option to generate a random password similar to what Google and every other password manager allows you to do.\n\nAnother missed opportunity is in the **Samsung Notes**\u00a0app. I love how straightforward and light it is especially for what it is supposed to be, a quick note taking app with amazing stylus support. Unfortunately this is where the positives end, the app has an abysmal desktop application on Windows (yeah I bet 90% of you didn\u2019t know Samsung Notes is available on Windows), where logging in takes literally 15 minutes of waiting for the sign in request to work only for you to realize that syncing the notes from your phone to your desktop might not even work. You have to manually sync the notes on Windows and even then, they take minutes for the process to complete. Samsung, either take it seriously or give up and use OneNote because it is pretty sad to see it play out this way. Oh and you can\u2019t install it directly on non Samsung laptops you need to run Command Prompt as admin and type in (winget install \u201cSamsung Notes\u201d) without parentheses and with quotations, accept the prompts twice by typing in (Y) and waiting for the install. Shame!\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n1. **Radios**\n   1. **WiFi** Reliable with good reach and speed. One small annoying issue is the clinginess that the phone has to a WiFi signal that it thinks is there but really isn\u2019t. I take walks around my house often to get those steps in, and I have to wait a solid 20 seconds after walking out of WiFi range for the phone to fully switch to data. Not the biggest of deals as I have an NFC tag (does anyone else use them anymore) that I scan that turns WiFi ON and OFF near my door, but it would be something that I would appreciate not having a mental note on.\n   2. **Data** I hate 5G. It\u2019s inconsistent and battery draining. 4G LTE signals are more than enough for me and that is what I have been using on it. No complaints whatsoever, and in fact it gets service in areas where my Fold 3 struggles to find an LTE signal in.\n   3. **Bluetooth** Similar to what\u2019s mentioned above, no issues with bluetooth at all.\n2. **Battery** While better than the Fold 3, there is more to be desired. I get around 5 hours of SOT with medium usage: which includes some Google Maps usage through Android Auto, Bluetooth streaming for around 4 hours a day through Spotify, an hour or so of Whatsapp, and 2-3 hours juggling social media apps, email, and the browser. Would love to see what the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 can do with the next Fold, and a larger battery would be appreciated.\n\n# What I\u2019d Like to See in the Z Fold 5\n\nThis is the part where I am going to be fairly blunt. Samsung, give us a Z Fold 5 Ultra. Yup, an Ultra foldable offering. The obvious question would be why? Why introduce more phones into the lineup given the rumors one of the S variants are going to be axed next year?\n\nThe reason is simply, different people want different things. I am sure people on this sub don\u2019t give 2 shits about the S Pen support the same way I don\u2019t give 2 shits about DeX (which is why I didn\u2019t mention it), but some do. The same can be said about other factors of the phone, whether it be the screen, camera, hinge, bla bla bla.\n\nIn any case, here is what I\u2019d like to see with the Z Fold 5 and my mythological Z Fold 5 Ultra.\n\n**Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5**\n\n* Better hinge (smoothness and reliability)\n* Improved battery life (increase capacity)\n* S Pen support on outer screen\n* Actual Under Panel Camera improvement\n* Improved camera system as outlined in the camera section above\n* Thinner and lighter phone\n\n**Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Ultra**\n\n* Built in S Pen\n* S23 Ultra camera\n* Wider front screen (ala Xiaomi Mix Fold 2 and Vivo X Fold)\n* Quad speaker setup\n* Bigger battery\n* Water drop design for improved crease\n* Experimentation with different back material (vegan leather, ceramic, etc)\n\n# Closing Remarks\n\nOverall, I am pretty pleased with Samsung\u2019s offerings in the foldable space and with the improvements the Fold 4 had over the Fold 3. It is a bit difficult to justify the upgrade, but I also think that Samsung has hit a roadblock for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, the lack of competition. The fact that in every other outside of China the only foldables you can get are Samsung\u2019s (and Motorola in some regions) is making Samsung go on autopilot on this release. However, within the Chinese market, we see every major brand (Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, Honor) release their own foldable with their own unique selling points. Honor for instance, has one of the lightest foldables, while Xiaomi has one of the slimmest. Ofcourse\u00a0these phones tend to have worse software or missing features (wireless charging or an IP rating), but are more daring in design, specially when it comes to hinges.\n\nSecond, which is to play devil\u2019s advocate here, what else can Samsung improve? As weird as it sounds, I feel like the Z Fold is bound to plateau, and idk what else there is to bring that would be \u201cnew\u201d or give off the \u201cwow\u201d factor again. Yeh they can improve the crease and make it thinner and then what? The software is naturally not going to be as productive as a tablet or a full fledged laptop due to the screen size limitation and the fact that Android still needs some work with streamlining multitasking features. I really don\u2019t know what else is there to look for in the future other than focusing on the basics: the screen, camera, battery.\n\nLastly, I feel that the presence of both the Z and the S line is putting Samsung in a weird position where they would like to push foldable as their \u201ciPhone\u201d moment but also being effectively forced to price them above the S line for the novelty of the idea. The obvious solution is to have the S line undercut their current prices by $100-$200 and slot the Z line right above it. That would make the product line more compelling for people who are still hesitant to make the switch and put their main SIM card into a foldable that might crack along the crease if luck deemed it.\n\nThank you \u00a0for making it this far, I certainly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d write this much but I just couldn\u2019t help but gush every thought in my mind onto this document. This is my first, of hopefully many, time doing it so maybe I\u2019ll develop brevity in the future. - MrSalikar (reddit.com\/u\/MrSalikar)\n\n**LINK:** [**https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRxKyGamWDEKO-6tmUDkfrIqTxoXYZmRenUJl1f0p2BGu6B9uyQTLyI1Z3mImSiNaT2hRmXEWyYFTq-\/pub**](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRxKyGamWDEKO-6tmUDkfrIqTxoXYZmRenUJl1f0p2BGu6B9uyQTLyI1Z3mImSiNaT2hRmXEWyYFTq-\/pub)","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1676224866.0},{"title":"flash.android.com fails at flashing step - Probably this is the reason","author":"afoam","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/110qmpe\/flashandroidcom_fails_at_flashing_step_probably\/","text":"I ran into this issue just now while trying to revert from CalyxOS to Stock Android using the Android Device Flasher from Google.

I've been wondering how to get the setting to appear since the S22 series launched. Up until now, I assumed that it was region locked like some other Samsung software features. After a few minutes of testing on my S23U, I discovered how to enable it. \n\nIt only works on games, and the game has to be in the foreground (not a pop-up window or multi window based on my brief testing). It looks like Game Launcher has a whitelist of apps that are recognized as games. It could have something to do with that database of 10,000 apps that Samsung was accused of using to throttle games (they weren't). You could rename the package names of your favourite apps to the package names of common games to take advantage of this setting. I tested it and it works as expected, with the caveat that it can break functionality and will break updates. This is similar to how you can rename the package name of a game to com.primatelabs.geekbench5 to get around Game Optimizing Service.\n\nIt doesn't appear to depend on the Android\/One UI version, as I couldn't get it working on an S21U on One UI 5 (Android 13).

The SD8 gen 2 chipset is really showing how much more efficient it is vs Exynos and the battery life I am seeing highlights this perfectly.\n\nFor reference, both times each phone had all apps and settings cloned over from the outgoing phone. All usage patterns are the same with the exception of the 23's day 1 usage having a 40 minute Zoom video call, but even still you can see how much % remains vs the screen on time - It's a huge difference and I suspect on a normal use day I could get 9-10 hours SoT out of this thing.\n\nI have no battery saving features enabled on either phone, and 5G is turned off in favour of 4G which is just wider supported here in the UK and still fast anyway.\n\nThe S22 Ultra's battery improved over time as Android learned my usage pattern, but the day 1 results are a solid indicator as to the direction the 23 Ultra should go as well. on the S22 Ultra battery screen says a full charge lasts \"1 day 18 hours\" and drilling through the past 7 days use, the screen on time is up to 4 hours average.\n\nI also had mobile hotspot enabled in this time on the S23 Ultra as was comparing cameras out and about and needed data on the S22 Ultra at the same time.\n\nI really hope Samsung just stick with Qualcomm chips globally from now on because this is such a great improvement it's unreal.\n\nEdit\\* This is all in the \"Standard\" performance profile, the S22 Ultra was and still is in the Optimised profile.

(c'mon Google)","author":"rhpeterson72","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/10zdaf9\/real_users_go_offgrid_cmon_google\/","text":"Can Google engineers stop pretending that all its users are connected to the grid all the time? Not everyone lives in California, and some grid dependencies range from annoying to dangerous. Two recent examples:\n\n1) I was using Google Maps recently to navigate to a wilderness destination. I had the route set and could see it all while on grid. I never closed Maps, but shortly after leaving network service, Maps lost the route and was totally useless. I would have been completely lost had I not had a general sense of direction from studying the route beforehand.\n\n2) I went up the canyon from Salt Lake City less than five miles from the city center. No cell service. Tried Google Fit to track my hike, but it was useless because I couldn't log in. No offline mode. This despite GPS functioning normally.\n\nLots of ways to fix these issues (and I hope people weigh in about how common they are in the real world, outside of California). Some ideas:\n\n- Offline map loading: \"Your route includes areas that are likely without network coverage. Would you like Maps to download maps to use offline ?\" Or better yet, Maps could do this automatically, behind the scenes, completely transparently to the user. (And yes, I know the user can already do this manually, but he\/she is much less likely than Google to know the areas in which carrier service is unavailable. I'm sure Google already has this dataset. If not, assembling it would be fairly straightforward.)\n\n- User prompt after being off grid: \"You've recently traveled through an area that didn't seem to have network service. Would you like to download map data for future offline use?\"\n\n- Offline mode for apps. I can't imagine why this isn't available. Why would a user have to log in to an account simply to use GPS tracking data that could be synced when the user is next on grid? How can the modern smartphone enable exploration\/adventure if it only functions normally when connected to the grid?\n\nFinally, I would like to know if Apple products are equally useless off the grid, for comparison purposes.","upvote_ratio":0.37,"created_utc":1676093568.0},{"title":"Android 14\u2019s advanced memory protection feature can protect your device from memory safety bugs","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/www.xda-developers.com\/android-14-advanced-memory-protection\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675916595.0},{"title":"Android 14 will let you restrict what photos apps can access even if they don\u2019t use the Photo Picker","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/www.xda-developers.com\/android-14-photo-picker-forced\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675889125.0},{"title":"Daily Superthread (Feb 09 2023) - Your daily thread for questions, device recommendations and general discussions!","author":"curated_android","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/10xt10u\/daily_superthread_feb_09_2023_your_daily_thread\/","text":"Note 1.

Especially when coming from a OnePlus 7 Pro, and the answer to that question seems difficult to find.\n\nSadly for OnePlus Oxygen Os changed a lot when merging to Color Os, prices went up and effort in making new OnePlus phones flagship killers went down, cameras seems to be below competition especially for the onepluses 8 to 10, the OnePlus 11 seems to be a step towards old OnePlus so maybe still a good phone, especially for lower budgets. OnePlus are still amongst the only top tier phones that have an alert slider, off screen gesture, very advanced screen customisation, ... \n\nNothing was expected to be a new \"OnePlus\" but it's not, hype didn't go well for them and they don't seem to have the resources to make the next big tech enthusiast phone, maybe they will be an interesting brand in a few years but it's not the case atm.\n\nGoogle seems to have those resources but it also seems that they try to ressemble more and more to apple they are doing choices that leads Android closer to iOS, making data\/obb directories read only, UI cleaner but less feature packed.. pixel phones in fact seem to have very small room for customisation with things such as the home widget which cannot be removed. Pixel phones are good phones for people that want a phone that works, good for every day basic use such as taking pics and going on social media, it's a phone to recommend to iPhone users that want to switch to Google or Samsung fans that never tried other phones but not sure it would fit OnePlus power users. And yes in the past Google phones have had plenty of issues but pixel 7's seem to have improved a lot.\n\niPhones are only best at videos or battery life, and it's the only option in my opinion for people already in the apple ecosystem as it is made to lock users in, so for people having iPads, Mac's, etc. For OnePlus users that just take pics, vids and go on social media, iPhones are an option but I would recommend waiting for the 15's series as they might get usbc, or at get rid of lighting.\n\n\nIn conclusion if coming from a OnePlus 7 Pro the new phone choice is very difficult to make, between the \n- OnePlus 11 which still have most of uncommon very useful features most op7 pro users are used to, very good optimisation and fluid\/fast user experience, good battery life and incredible charging speed, speakers and haptics but changed a lot with Color Os, features getting removed and camera is not the best but good\n- Pixel 7 Pro where haptics, user experience, and photos are spot on but where features\/customizability lack, battery and speakers are not the best\n- iPhones where videos are top tier, battery is the best, user experience is good and lifespan with updates is way above competition but it lacks too much of android's features and charging speed is very bad.\n- Samsung's S23 Ultra which is feature packed, from the spen to the call screening and 10x zoom (just lacks off screen gestures and alert slider), has good lifespan and longest android update support in my knowledge with very frequent updates, is very fast and smooth, good sounding and very customizable but pictures and video are not the best, the price is very high and battery life has to be determined, it also is a very big phone, heavy and not easy to manage and the notification panel looks awfull.\n- Other high end Chinese phones such as Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo, ... where features are often their key advantage but often lack of update support and photo\/videos are not that good (this depends Oppo showed that they had good photo capabilitiesbut I didn't experience them)\n\nTherefore I would go with the following phones in the following scenario's:\n- OnePlus 11 if looking for performance, battery life, oneplus unique features and stability, similar UI, ok tier photos and videos, lower price\n- Pixel 7 Pro if looking for the best pictures\/videos, good voice recognition and recording, have a lot of other Google devices, average high budget\n- iPhones if in apple ecosystem, doing a lot of videos, only using basic apps and social media, don't care about android's customizability and exclusive features (modded apps, etc), long lasting phone, high budget\n- Samsung S23 Ultra if don't care about big phone, are ok with Samsung's interface and the way notification panel looks\/coming from a Samsung phone and used to the experience, want a very fast and stable phone, long lasting but android, high budget, not the biggest photographer\/videographer out there, have other Samsung devices, are an artist and have the use of a pen, don't care about loosing a lot of time setting up your phone and like very feature packed phones\/gadgets.\n- Chinese phones if you have a low budget, come from one of these phones or need some particular features they offer such as IR on Xiaomi phones etc\n\nPs: if you want to spend bellow 500$ buy an old flagship not a new phone released under that price","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1675898140.0},{"title":"Godot Editor (Beta) arrives to the Play Store","author":"crotonaldehyde","url":"https:\/\/godotengine.org\/article\/android_godot_editor_play_store_beta_release\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675838515.0},{"title":"BoM Analysis -

Also I feel like the lockscreen is getting more and more clunky with each update. I expect a big camera update and especially like to see a new and improved selfie camera. 200MP sensor sounds like a gimmick to me, but we\u2018ll see whether images are actually better.

Each variant is unique and original, containing additional content such as KWGT widgets and exclusive wallpapers.\n\nAll three variants are handcrafted and maintained by me as a solo creator. **Reev Pro** and **Reev Dark** feature monochromatic designs, while **Reev Chroma** follows a custom color scheme that took me a year to perfect and an additional three months to individually color over 2,000 icons.\n\n# Why the suspension is wrong:\n\nIf the suspension reasons provided by Google were applied to the entire Play Store, there would be barely any icon packs left. Currently, there are hundreds of icon packs with multiple variants on the Play Store that look similar but have different color schemes and design languages for fresh looks and feel. Here are some common examples:\n\n1. LineBit - [Screenshot](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/y8qRHqkt\/image.png)\n2. LineX - [Screenshot](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1t4XFM8D\/image.png)\n3. Noodelines - [Screenshot](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/SNL87SSd\/image.png)\n\nAll of these icon packs contain unique content. Each variant has its own design language and includes additional content beyond the icons. Users value the icon designs and that's what they want. These are not just copied packs. Although the icon shapes are transferred to other apps, they are not just left as is. Each variant is carefully crafted and follows specific guidelines to give them an original identity.\n\n# Why not submit an appeal?\n\nI can, but who will listen? [This is what the Actions section states in the email](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Kv5k30fs\/image.png).\n\n\\#4 says *\"...submit the updated, policy compliant app using a* ***new package name*** *and a new app name.\"* which indicates that I can no longer update the app to make changes to it.\n\nI am not going to risk creating an app with a new package name in hopes that it works just to end up getting my entire account terminated in the process. This is my livelihood, my bread and butter. I have been maintaining my apps for 4 years with weekly updates and new content. I cannot risk losing all my hard work overnight.\n\n# What I think might have triggered the suspension:\n\nThis is pure speculation. Only Google can have a solid answer, but it is a possibility that is worth pointing out.\n\nPrior to releasing my latest variant (Reev Chroma), I copied part of the play store description from Reev Dark, since both apps share the same dashboard under the hood (same as all other icon packs called [Blueprint Dashboard](https:\/\/github.com\/jahirfiquitiva\/Blueprint\/)).\n\nWhy I think this is possible is I copied the paragraph from Reev Dark (which is the second app that is suspended). The paragraph contained supported launchers list and dashboard featured. Only changing the headline color. Could this minor duplication of description what triggered it?\n\nWhy I think this isn't the reason is that for the last year, Reev Pro and Reev Dark both shared the same listing descriptions, but neither had any issues like this. So I'm not entirely sure whether this is the case or not.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nThere is no conclusion, though I will update this post if things change. The last few days have been extremely stressful for me because this is my only source of income at the moment and the longer these apps stay suspended, the more revenue I lose every day. It has completely disrupted further development of my apps.\n\n**If anyone from Google is reading this,** this is wrong and my suspension should be reversed. I have always been policy compliant and still am. My apps and the content in them are original and provide a unique value in each variant to its users. I should not be punished for making my own content.\n\n# UPDATE:\n\nTHEY'RE BACK! After AndroidPolice covered it on their website, both apps were soon after reinstated.\n\n[Here's the email (cropped unnecessary info)](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bf9lwGe.jpg) I got from Google for reinstatement. I still have no idea why they were suspended in the first place. The email does not contain any more information.\n\n**Massive** thanks to Jules Wang from AndroidPolice for covering this story.

The goal was to create a place that people can go to find the best Android apps and games that are currently on sale.\n\nMost of the solutions that were available for the community at that time offered a similar service (showing which apps\/games were on sale), but had virtually zero moderation about it. This meant that the websites\/apps that display these sales were filled with ancient looking widgets, outdated (pre-holo designed) apps, and lots of \"premium\" versions of free to play games that developers release alongside the free game that includes some premium currency.\n\nNot only that, but developers seem to game those systems by marking up the price of their app\/game to something extraordinarily high, only to drop it to its \"normal price\" once they see it's made it to those sites.\n\nMy goal was to scour all of the places that offered these services and handpick the best Android applications and games that are currently available.\n\nThe website has been steadily growing but it wasn't something I was able to put that much time into. I was writing about Android news for websites like XDA and Phandroid and only had enough time to maintain the current slate of features.\n\nThis meant the design the website had not changed since the website launched and had started to become long in the tooth. So over the last year I began working on a new style in an attempt to make the website look more modern.\n\nI am far from a great designer and have tried to keep things as minimal as possible in an attempt to not go overboard in the wrong direction.\n\nSo I invite you all to check out the new look at [https:\/\/www.PlayStoreSales.com\/](https:\/\/www.PlayStoreSales.com\/)\n\nI recently shared this new launch with \/r\/AndroidApps recently and received some feedback as to how the website is laid out. They weren't happy with the categories being separated, and thought a compact view would be ideal.\n\nSo I spent some time and now have all of the apps and games on sale at the URL [https:\/\/PlayStoreSales.com\/all\/](https:\/\/PlayStoreSales.com\/all\/)\n\nI still want to work on the design of that page a little bit (adding some descriptive text there, maybe putting in a sidebar too) but the goal is to keep it minimal, keep it compact, and keep it loading fast.\n\nAlso, over these 8 years I have done my best to keep track of the highest and lowest prices that the apps\/games featured on the website had ever hit. And display that in the app details tablet right on the sale page.\n\nBut I've always wanted to track price history changes as well and I was recently able to get that added as a feature on the website as well. Since the feature was just added, I don't have all of the historical data for price changes.\n\nBut going forward, each time an app\/game that's listed on the website changes its price, you will see it in the graph right before the app description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be a honor if you could check out the website and give your honest feedback on the new design, the new All page, and the new Price History graph.\n\nHappy weekend, everyone!","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1674846687.0},{"title":"Samsung OneUI vs Google Pixel UI: Best Lock Screen!","author":"I-Sleep-At-Work","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wiCOHYxSmXA","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1674834974.0},{"title":"10 days with Nothing Phone - review","author":"thatcodingboi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/10mnz98\/10_days_with_nothing_phone_review\/","text":"I got the Nothing Phone in the US when they launched their beta program, so I got it for $299, and I must say I am absolutely impressed.\n\n**Build:** phone is really well built and I loved the flat display (bring these back), symmetric bezels and unique back design. Definitely got some comments about how cool it looked. I think my only complaint would be that the buttons are a bit soft to press resulting in some accidental screenshots, but my last phone had volume and power on one side so I can press as hard as I want when adjusting volume without it being possible to take screenshots. Despite the sharp edges of the design it was surprisingly comfortable and I never had issues with it cutting into my fingers. The phone felt sturdy and good to use. Does it look a bit like an iPhone, I think so. Does it look better than an iPhone, I think so. Fingerprints were also really easy to remove off both front and back glass. The oleophobic coating they used is very good. My pixel and samsung gathered fingerprints like no other day 1.\n\n**Fingerprint sensor:** good location and very snappy. Was only denied like once or twice, otherwise every time it was quick and reliable.\n\n**Battery:** On 4g and 5g the phone never got below 40% by the end of the day, it was pretty incredible. Coming from a Pixel 6pro this was the most noticeable improvement. One day I ended at 56% going from 8am to 11:30pm.\n\n**Network\/Signal:** This surprised me the most. This phone was consistently pulling signal on T-mobile in places where my Pixel 6pro and my wifes S22 were not. When leaving dead zones like my buildings garage it usually takes my pixel 1-2 blocks to pickup signal again. The Nothing Phone (1) was connecting the moment I exited the garage. Usually this would be concerning as constantly scanning when you have no signal can lead to battery drain, but this phone had excellent battery. I live in  Washington, DC for context.\n\n**Software:** Not the biggest fan of the pixel dot text, but they kept it in minimal places and understated. The android experience was largely stock with small improvements like a network toggle that let you open your wifi settings (looking at you google). Any custom app like the weather app are clean, nicely designed and only notify if you allow them. There is basically 0 bloat. Well done. Was testing on Android 13\n\n**Performance:** I don't really game and am mainly web browsing, news, reddit, texting, watching videos, slack for work, and productivity apps like doc collaboration for work. At no point did I see a drop in performance. What I did notice was no matter what I did this phone never warmed up like my Pixel 6pro or my S21+ was prone to. I don't game on my phone so I can't speak to this, but this is probably where you would notice the 778G+ vs 8G1 or Tensor. Display ran at a buttery smooth 144hz.\n\n**Camera:** This unfortunately is what caused me to return the phone. I think for the price the phone is well worth its asking, but some photos and videos in particular seemed very dark and lost detail due to this. Coming from a Pixel 6pro this was a huge downgrade even though when the Nothing Phone took a good picture I preferred that it didn't look so aggressively enhanced like the Pixel can do. I have a mini goldendoodle with a soft redish coat. The pixel always hyper-sharpen her coat and darkens shadows it making it look very harsh to what it actually is. The Nothing Phone did a wonderful job of capturing the image like it looked, albeit not well in low-light. Not having a telephoto greater than 2x also wasn't great.\n\n**Support:** This is where I was blown away, I went to return the phone within the 14 day period. The process involved emailing with customer service and they were absolutely fantastic. Responsive within minutes every time I emailed them. They were super understanding and the moment I stated I didn't like the camera that's all it took, no forced troubleshooting, or updating or any nonsense. They sent me a FedEx label and scheduled an appt for FedEx to pickup at my apartment. $15 fee for the return. Completely understandable.\n\n**Glyph lighting:** its a gimmick but one I don't hate. I don't put my upside down much so I basically never used it, but the look definitely was unique in a sea of phones that look the same, so I can't even dock them for trying. If they can make the bezel on the front a lighting element in the next phone there would be more utility, but again I am going to give them points for trying to differentiate themselves. The lighting also made the ever so softest sound when activating, so it made my vibrate more noticeable. Its a subtle thing you only notice if you have the phone on you or sitting in front of you.\n\n**Closing thoughts:** I know there is a lot of controversy surrounding Nothing about their NFT stuff, hype marketing, and design. I am going to ignore that and judge the experience and product. It was the most excited I have been to use a phone in a while. At $499 I still think its a great phone. Are the phones that are \"better value\", yes, but I think this phone is unique in its offerings. They definitely had a vision on what they wanted and focused on that. I am glad they didn't over-extend and try to deliver it all. I am also just a huge sucker for quality service. I will 100% buy the Nothing Phone (2) if it launches in the US with full carrier compatibility and a slightly improved camera.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1674834301.0},{"title":"Smartphone sales are so bad even the holidays couldn\u2019t help, says IDC","author":"BcuzRacecar","url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/1\/26\/23572369\/smartphone-shipments-2022-down-idc-holiday-inflation","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674755756.0},{"title":"Daily Superthread (Jan 27 2023) - Your daily thread for questions, device recommendations and general discussions!","author":"curated_android","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/10mj4j9\/daily_superthread_jan_27_2023_your_daily_thread\/","text":"Note 1.

But it's kinda messed up that iOS doesn't even tell you where it's putting them -- and it'll probably be a surprise for some people with private notes to find the notes have been added to Google's services and not just locally on the phone.\n\n(I only realized all of this after having a WTF moment looking at Google Keep and seeing stuff that I KNEW I had not written\/added there. Further investigation let me find the hundreds of disorganized notes from past devices added)\n\nedit: ugh i misspoke. It was definitely not an apple application. It was on a Pixel 7 Pro for new setup.

Why can't smartphone cameras still achieve that 3D camera look?","author":"DiplomatikEmunetey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/10j0eg1\/have_we_reached_the_limit_of_hardware_why_cant\/","text":"I was playing around with my RX100 on the weekend, for those that don't know, it's a camera with a 1\" sensor released in 2012. And I came to a realization. It clipped light, was blurry at lot and overall was nowhere near as easy to use as my Pixel 4a, but it managed to do something Pixel 4a cannot. And that is to make images look like they came out of a dedicated camera. Every photo, even blurry ones, came out with that \"look\". Images look 3D. It is an effect effect that smartphones cannot seem to be able to create. I think it is due to the lens. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n[Dashboard](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VOy94yD.jpg) - The light is clipped. Colour accuracy can be argued. The image itself is not super sharp in the center, it has shake in it. But, there is nice blur behind and nice blur in front, creating depth and focus.\n\n[My little buddy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/W1FlYk8.jpg) - 3D effect. Blur is bit weird on top of his head, don't know what happened there, but otherwise nice image.\n\n[The other little buddy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fe7pNQj.jpg) - This picture is in focus and sharp. And it has a very nice 3D effect.\n\nSmartphones generally destroy dedicated cameras in imaging when used by average users. Even DSLRs. Take Google Pixel. It is the ultimate imaging tool. When you absolutely, positively need to capture the surroundings with the maximum accuracy and capture as much as possible, you need a Pixel. It's not always pleasant and nice looking (I've mentioned before, bright shadows, grain, noise, haze), but you will get maximum information in the image. There is more chance that you will get a usable unprepared (no tripod, no setup) shot on your smartphone than on your full-frame DSLR because all the intelligence smartphone cameras have. But they cannot achieve that camera look. Hence, it's an imaging tool to me and not a photography tool, a camera, if you get what I mean. It cannot achieve the 3D camera look.\n\nSoftware is close to perfect with pretty much every trick in the book thrown in.\n\nI thought 1\" sensors would make that difference but they seem to have made little to no difference (look at MKBHD's comparison, IMX363 won that. Xiaomi 12S Ultra lost, a lot!). I can't imagine they'll be getting any bigger.\n\nAnd lenses that are included with them seem to be awful. And that is probably my main point of discussion here. What happened to the lenses of smartphones? RX100's blur is pleasant, it's got smooth roll off whereas on smartphones it has actually regressed. It's unpleasant and adds ghosting.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nPixel 4a, [check the text on the edges](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6osgjC4.jpg). It looks awful! In comparison [Lumia 950's lens is much better](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qdpRIJr.jpg).\n\n[Pixel 4a Skechers](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lHNsK7d.jpg). The text looks like it's evaporating. Nokia 808 on the other hand [looks fine](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/inRtT07.jpg).\n\n[Medjool dates](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4YPufAW.jpg). Lots of ghosting on the of the writing in the back. [Lumia 950] (https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HqADqTm.jpg), blur, but no ghosting.\n\nFinally, [document](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/r6SeKzR.jpg), that's on Pixel 4a, check the top of it, and the bottom of it. There is ghosting on it. It makes taking pictures of documents almost useless. 950 on the other hand [captures it fine](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sXfQrSt.jpg). Top and bottom are sharp.\n\nI thought this may have been just Pixel 4a. But then I went and checked and it seems pretty much all of the modern smartphones have this issue. Here's [Pixel 7](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/22\/google-pixel-7\/camera\/gsmarena_041.jpg) from GSMArena. There is so much ghosting around the perimeter. [Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tSsXkld.jpg). [Xiaomi 12S Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/22\/xiaomi-12s-ultra\/daylight\/gsmarena_111.jpg). Older phones like LG G4, Moto G4 do not have ghosting like this at all. It started at around the time OG Pixel came out. Even Nexus 5X does not have this. Is it because of bigger sensors?

The problem with \"Smart Lock\" is that it's really not smart *or* secure \u2014 just because your phone is connected to your watch via Bluetooth doesn't mean your watch is actively on your person or even within a couple of feet.  \n\nAs such, Google appears to be rebranding \"Smart Lock\" to \"Extend Unlock\", as [I recently discovered](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1614774381871353858) in version 23.02 of the Google Play Services app (see the strings below). This new naming makes sense as the feature merely *keeps* your phone unlocked when it's *already* unlocked. It doesn't actually *unlock* your phone when it's locked.   \n\n    <string name=\"extend_unlock_removal_failure_dialog_message\">Something went wrong. Try again.<\/string>\n    <string name=\"extend_unlock_removal_failure_dialog_title\">\"Can't remove watch from Extend Unlock\"<\/string>\n    <string name=\"extend_unlock_removal_prompt_dialog_message\">\"You'll be able to unlock this phone with %1$s.\n\n    Your watch will no longer keep this phone unlocked with Extend Unlock (previously Smart Lock).\n\n    You can add your watch back to Extend Unlock at any time in Settings.\"<\/string>\n\nIn comparison, the new \"Watch Unlock\" feature being developed for the Pixel Watch *will* actually unlock your device. I've been [tracking this feature for a while now](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/pixel-7-features-android-13\/#every-pixel-7-feature-backed-by-android-13-apis:~:text=Google%20Play%20Services-,Watch%20Unlock,-One%20of%20the), and it seems to use a new API in Android 13 called [Active Unlock](https:\/\/cs.android.com\/android\/_\/android\/platform\/frameworks\/base\/+\/fe7e9e9a6dfa976abf66614a32321e93d0a3fa49). The way this works is that there are new \"active unlock triggers\" such as WAKE, UNLOCK_INTENT, BIOMETRIC_FAIL, and ASSISTANT. For the BIOMETRIC_FAIL active unlock trigger, for example, Watch Unlock will trigger AFTER your phone fails to recognize your face\/fingerprint. Your phone will be unlocked automatically if your watch is unlocked and nearby\/on your wrist (within ~1m based on Bluetooth RSSI values).  \n\nThe text of the [\"Watch Unlock\" setup page](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Watch-Unlock_2.png?w=598&ssl=1) also suggests that the ASSISTANT and UNLOCK_INTENT triggers might be used to let you perform certain voice commands and open certain notifications that otherwise would've required you to unlock your phone:\n\n> Use your watch to securely unlock your phone after you wake it. This can be helpful to access notifications and your digital assistant, or when your face or fingerprint isn't recognized.\n\nGoogle appeared to show off Watch Unlock at its CES 2023 booth and [confirmed to *Android Police*](https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/google-pixel-watch-keep-smartphone-unlocked-ces-2023\/) that the feature indeed requires you to be wearing your watch in order for it to function. No release date has been given yet, but it's something we could see dropping in the near future. Watch Unlock is a part of the Google Play Services app and since it uses the Active Unlock API as I mentioned before, it will require Android 13+ to function.\n\nCoincidentally, [Android is adding a framework API](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1615461533886160897) for measuring the distance between devices using Bluetooth RSSI. This is obviously not a super precise way to do distance measurements, but it should be good enough for something like this \"Watch Unlock\" feature. Now, due to the way the Bluetooth Mainline module works in Android 13 (it's a non-updatable Mainline module and thus requires an OTA update to update) and the fact that there's an API freeze, it's possible \"Watch Unlock\" may not be using this exact API (it may use some internal Play Services API) or if it is, that the feature won't be available for Pixels until a later release. We'll have to wait to find out.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674243993.0},{"title":"Towards a reproducible F-Droid","author":"devolute","url":"https:\/\/f-droid.org\/2023\/01\/15\/towards-a-reproducible-fdroid.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674245190.0},{"title":"Home Assistant coming for your car!","author":"MishaalRahman","url":"https:\/\/www.home-assistant.io\/blog\/2023\/01\/20\/android-auto\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1674253035.0},{"title":"\u231a\ufe0f Leak: Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 - one of the first watches to ship with Snapdragon W5(+) and Wear OS 3 - Kuba Wojciechowski\u26a1","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Za_Raczke\/status\/1616547751948439565","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1674257051.0},{"title":"Samsung Wallet Will Be Available in 8 New Markets","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/news.samsung.com\/global\/samsung-wallet-will-be-available-in-eight-new-markets","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1674239707.0},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S22 series added to the iFixit Samsung Self Repair program (US only)","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/collaborations\/samsung","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674239511.0},{"title":"Twitter\u2019s new developer terms ban third-party clients | Engadget","author":"kbDL-","url":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html?src=rss","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674166562.0},{"title":"Born out of the imagination: Find out #PHANTOMFOLDABLECONCEPT Vision V and unroll your wide-open possibilities. - tecnomobile","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tecnomobile\/status\/1616020142428659713","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.36,"created_utc":1674353900.0},{"title":"I had a soft spot for the old CyanogenMod 9 wallpapers, so I decided to upscale them!","author":"Negative-Nidorina-42","url":"https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/cndTn8y","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674201474.0},{"title":"Android 13 is running on 5.2% of all devices five months after launch","author":"howling92","url":"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2023\/01\/18\/android-13-device-distribution\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674124394.0},{"title":"Daily Superthread (Jan 20 2023) - Your daily thread for questions, device recommendations and general discussions!","author":"curated_android","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/10gv6ec\/daily_superthread_jan_20_2023_your_daily_thread\/","text":"Note 1.

Official audiobook are still better but the voices sound natural enough that it gets the job done.\n\n---\n\nEdit: \n\nI found out **Android's Microsoft Edge** also has this feature, it has less voices but it's still has a variety of good ones.\n**Method 02: Using Android's Microsoft Edge**\n\n* Just open your novel in Microsoft Edge (maybe via Royal Road, WuxiaWorld, Google Play Books, etc.), \n\n* open the options (three dots in bottom middle of the screen)\n\n* then click Read Aloud. \n\n* You can choose from a variety of voices by clicking voice options on the top right.\n\n  * (e.g. Microsoft Christopher Online (Natural) - English (US), which is my favourite voice among the ones available).\n\n---\n\nEdit: I saw that the system-wide TTS isn't working for some of you, here's an alternative I found.\n\n**Method 03: System wide TTS engine using TTS Server app**\n\n* Download the zip file: TTS-Server_0.2_202212312219 in this [github link](https:\/\/github.com\/jing332\/tts-server-android\/actions\/runs\/3812485613) (note: you have to login to your github account for link to work)\n\n* Extract the zip file\n\n* Install the apk\n\n* The app is in broken English so it's a bit easier to navigate.\n\n* Click the \"+\" on the top right\n\n* Change the language in to your desired choice (e.g. English US)\n\n* Choose your chosen voice\n\n  * You can get a preview of the voice by putting words in the preview form and then hit play.\n\n* Exit out of the app and go to Android Settings\n\n* Search for Text to Speech or go to System > Language & Keyboard > Text-to-Speech Output (it will vary \non your phone but this is the general idea).\n\n* Change the engine to TTS Server\n\n* Use an epub reader with TTS feature (like Google Play Books), then open TTS feature and enjoy!\n\n* **Too slow?** try this: Hamburger Menu (Top Right) > Settings > Turn on User DNS to resolve API IP\n\n---\n**\"This is a lot of work, is there an easier way?\"**\n\nWell you can change the voice of the default TTS Engine on your phone (mostly Google TTS or Samsung TTS). I noticed that the default voice is bad, but some of the other voices is a slight upgrade.\n\n**Method 04: Adjusting Google Speech Services\/Samsung TTS Engine**\n\n* go to Android Settings\n\n* Search for Text to Speech or go to System > Language & Keyboard > Text-to-Speech Output (it will vary \non your phone but this is the general idea).\n\n* Click on the setting icon near the TTS Engine\n\n* Find Install Voice Data\n\n* Find your language of choice (English US, English UK, etc.)\n\n* Download\/Choose among the various voices in there\n\n* Go back and then you can preview the voice. You can also change the speed and pitch of the voice.\n\n* Use an epub reader with TTS feature (like Google Play Books), then open TTS feature and enjoy!\n\nBonus: If you're using Google Play Books for book reading and using Google TTS, you can go to Google Play books setting and turn on \"High Quality Voice\" (Idk how much of a difference this makes but it should be better).\n\n---\n\n**Method 05: another TTS app**\n\n* Download the TTS Apk in this [github link](https:\/\/github.com\/ag2s20150909\/TTS)\n* Install the TTS \n* In your Android Settings, find Text-To-Speech settings.\n* Change engine from the previously installed Text-To-Speech to this new one.\n* Use an epub reader with TTS feature (like Google Play Books), then open TTS feature and enjoy!\n\n* If you want to change the default voice (Jenny+) to another, \n  * Open the installed TTS (it's in Chinese so it's a bit hard to navigate).\n  * Next Click this to enable customization.\n  * Double click the name of your choice to choose and hear an example of said voice (i.e. Christopher, Sonia, etc.)\n  * There are other settings in there, here's a link to an album of screenshots and their corresponding translation.\n\n(I'll update the links to the pictures later.)","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1673277966.0},{"title":"[UPDATE] Just switched from S20FE to Pixel 7","author":"soltzberg","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/107qu2o\/update_just_switched_from_s20fe_to_pixel_7\/","text":"[Original post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/zzrcww\/just_switched_from_s20fe_to_pixel_7\/)\n\nAfter playing around with the Pixel for a few days, I finally decided to return it and keep my S20FE 5G.\n\nMy decision wasn't based on specifically negative aspects of the P7. Here are my conclusions:\n\n\u2022 PROS: Everything ran as expected. At the beginning, I had noticed the P7 heating quite a bit, but that seemed normal due to all the updates and background magic. That eventually sorted itself out. Software experience was smooth and I definitely noticed the improved AI over Samsung. I enjoyed the Pixel UI and everything was intuitive despite having never used a Pixel phone before. I really liked face unlock, it worked like a charm for me, and I barely needed to use fingerprint. Photos were pristine. I won't post a comparison, but it comes as no surprise that P7 photos were quite good, and in a way captured colors more true to life than S20FE (not to say that the latter's photos are by any means bad, I've gotten some great pics with it). Battery life was another great improvement, not just compared to my 2.5 year old phone, but in general. I'd say I'm a moderate-to-heavy user, and yet the P7 is the first phone to last the day with me (with some left after I fall asleep). I did charge it overnight, so it's usually dropped to around 15% at most.\n\n\u2022 CONS: My biggest gripe was related to the display. I'm aware the P7 Pro uses a better, more expensive display, but for vanilla P7, I could tell it wasn't the best. Putting the two phones side by side for a display comparison, I was still more drawn to the S20FE display. It was more vibrant and had better contrast to my eyes. Everything on the Pixel was.. well.. Darker? I'm not sure how to describe it, but watching the same video on both phones, it was almost hard to see some things because of how dark the video was on the Pixel display. I also noticed the reduction in refresh rate, but that's obviously because the S20FE was right there next to it. I generally preferred the scrolling experience on the S20FE as well, which I had mentioned in the original post. Finally, there was a noticable greenish tint on the Pixel display when compared to the S20FE. \n\nSo in conclusion, Pixel 7 is a solid phone, and with the S20FE trade-in, I'd have paid around 319 euros for it (with a 100 euro credit on my mobile plan, basically saving another 100 euros for a final price of 219 euros). Personally, I **did not find it a good deal for what I'm getting compared to what I had**. I have no doubt the P7 will outlast my S20FE in terms of functionality given Google's efficient software updates, but for the moment, I'm holding on to my S20FE. Will probably replace its battery though.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1673300186.0},{"title":"Day And Night Map for Android is now open source","author":"folli","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/107ds2s\/day_and_night_map_for_android_is_now_open_source\/","text":"An open source port of [Day And Night Map](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.genewarrior.daynightmap) (which in turn is based on [Sun Locator](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.genewarrior.sunlocator.pro)) is now available on GitHub:\n\n[**https:\/\/github.com\/r-follador\/DayNightMap**](https:\/\/github.com\/r-follador\/DayNightMap)\n\nThe World map shows what areas of the Earth are in daylight, which are at night and in twilight.\n\nUse the slider to interactively set the time and date and visualize the changing of the seasons and the length of the day.\n\nThe widget shows live data on your homescreen and is designed to be very battery friendly.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1673269081.0},{"title":"The Doogee V Max Phone with a whopping 22,000 mAh battery and Night Vision camera leaks","author":"thatmark210","url":"https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/doogee_v_max_full_specs_images-news-57114.php","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1673229496.0},{"title":"Will the surface duo 2 ever be restocked?

Even if arm wins or loses this suit. It has pushed more rapid development to risc-v for this suit just existing. We just saw a few days ago Google announcing Android for risc-v. Also apparently arm terminated nuvia's license agreement already. I don't think it would go nuclear in the sense of nuvia ip being destroyed. But either way this doesn't boad well for arm's future. \n\n\"In a world where Arm is willing to arbitrarily withhold vital intellectual property in such deals, startups and investors must worry that any Arm license creates the possibility that a successful exit could be unilaterally blocked. If Arm is willing to inflict billions of dollars of damage on one of its best customers, other customers must be concerned about their own license agreements,\"-[Linley Gwenapp](https:\/\/www.techinsights.com\/blog\/editorial-arms-no-win-legal-fight?utm_medium=email&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=2022_FY_Logic_Linley_Newsletter)\n\nBut if this battle does continue past 2023\/2024 I think we will see a slow down in performance for arm chips, while these companies focus on risc-v development. Maybe we will see a boost in efficiency and such. \n\nBut I wonder how companies that make their own custom arm chips like apple or do some customization (co processor) like Google, bbk and such  will react to this. We know that oppo is developing their own custom chip in house.

Even after a good cleaning, for the last couple months my USB port decided it wanted to be directional. I took it as a sign it was time to move on. \n\nWhy the P6P? Why not the 6a or the 7P, or a Samsung? TL;DR - Was able to pick up a like-new 6 Pro for $350 USD. So  the 6a is $299 (+tax) which would be nearly the same out the door. The 7 and the Samsung would be literally twice the price, for not too much benefit.\n\nSome thoughts --\n\n* Performance - Clearly the 6 faster. Per benchmarks, about 1.5x. I am not a mobile gamer, and fairly casual overall so on a day to day, I was not complaining about the 3's performance. The only issue is that the 4GB of ram on the 3 did occasionally present to be problematic when running maps and streaming audio and oh I also wanted to google something real quick. Frankly, if the 3 had 8 gb of ram, I probably wouldn't have complained about it at all.  \n\n* Camera - Have had limited opportunities to test this yet. We've been having shit weather this week so I haven't been able to get out much. But around the house, I have been taking pics of my cat, and generally happy with the results. I like being able to zoom to 4x without the picture turning into a mess immediately. \n\n* Fingerprint - I still miss the back mounted finger scanner on the 3. It was faster and almost foolproof to get the angles right. Super natural and convenient. I also miss the gestures you could do with it. On the flip side, being able to unlock the phone when its sitting on my desk without having to pick it up is a welcome addition. But no - I haven't had any problems with the 6's finger unlock. It's fast enough, and accurate enough to not be annoying.\n\n* Feel in the hand. It's heavy, and chunky. Feels 2x heavy, and 2x chunky. Very reassuring solidity to it, but also reminds me to never skip arm day at the gym. I never thought the 3 XL was particularly dainty either, but now I do? On a related note - the Google fabric cases for the 3 were fantastic. Peak case design. A shame that their 6 variants are such crap. Using a Spigen Tough Armor - which adds to the aforementioned chonk, but also makes me feel better about the curved display.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1672970022.0},{"title":"Meet the New Lenovo ThinkPhone by Motorola for Unmatched Business Device Experience","author":"FragmentedChicken","url":"https:\/\/news.lenovo.com\/pressroom\/press-releases\/thinkphone-by-motorola-unmatched-business-device-experience\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1672938269.0}]
