        "text": "This is a curious epiphany I just had. Both water wheels and protonmotive pumps are driven by a reservoir of potential energy, which is then harnessed to mechanically drive other processes (ATP production in the cell, or running a mill with the water wheel). Where this becomes more interesting, the protonmotive pump was there since virtually the beginning of life on Earth - tirelessly working away in the background throughout history. Only recently did we humans unwittingly recreate this type of machine on a macro scale. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk",

But how would say a giant squid/ colossal squid that live over 1000ft can still survive but thrive in the deep along with many other gigantic special like (forget the name of the species) there’s a shrimp in the Marianas trench that’s significant more larger than any shrimp found other than the ones found near Antarctic.

        "text": "As a math and physics guy, I could be totally off base with my approach to thinking about this, which is why I'm reaching out to all you wonderful people here in r/biology!\n\nI think of the human eye as fundamentally a \"visible light antenna.\" Radio antennas can be constructed to operate efficiently on different frequencies, and in our case the human eye is capable of \"receiving\" radiation from a *very specific* part of that same electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nSo if my analogy is correct, would that mean if a human eye were to \"zoom in\" to observe wavelengths smaller than in the visible light spectrum, it would be dark? Furthermore, if that is indeed the case, what would it look like as one approached those wavelengths? Would it get progressively \"noisier\" and/or darker, or would there be a sharp cutoff where all of a sudden the eye would see nothing?\n\nAnd one final thing: humans are capable of observing light in our \"normal\" reference frame, obviously; yet we cannot see radio frequency signals, infrared, or ultraviolet light without special tools. To use another radio analogy, this seems to me like we have incredibly finely tuned band-pass filters that attenuate signals above or below the visible light spectrum. Kind of interesting to think about.\n\nAnyway, thanks for indulging in my thought experiment! I'm interested to see what you all think.",

[Here's an article on this technique.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02334-2)\n\nI've seen these \"synthetic embryos\" referred to as \"mocks\", \"facsimiles\", and \"models\". But is this misleading? It appears they do not develop arbitrarily like a cellular aggregate, and they have more organization than a teratoma, but as a rule their gestation arrests before viability (whether due to lack of capacity or insufficient environment appears unknown). It seems they can't orchestrate a body plan in entirety. Does this make a synthetic embryo a whole organism that lacks an essential part, or part of an organism that is not whole on its own?\n\n**Are these synthetic embryos mere derivatives of organisms? Or are they deficient organisms? And WHY?**\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10vfwf2)",

        "author": "REVANORP2009",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/10v59yt/animal_rights_group_drives_birds_into_extinction/",
        "text": "I am an ordinary South Korean middle school student who is very interested in biology. It may seem strange to see an Asian student suddenly asking for help, but I'm writing this because an endangered bird is on the verge of extinction by public and media irrelevance and hypocritical animal rights groups. The situation seems difficult to resolve on its own in South Korea, which is why it is trying to convey this message to 3 million unseen foreigners.\n\n\nAt the southern end of the Korean Peninsula is a small island called Marado. The island, which is first reached by numerous migratory birds passing through Korea through the Korean Peninsula, is visited by migratory birds who have completed a long journey every spring.\n\n\nSynthliboramphus wumizusume, commonly called the Japanese murrelet, is a special species among birds that come to Marado. It is estimated that there are only 5,000 to 10,000 birds left in the world, like sea otters, floating on the sea all their lives, and They come up to the ground only during their breeding season. They build nests in steep places like cliffs and lay one or two eggs, and their young do not come up to the land until they are mature enough to jump into the sea and reproduce as soon as they are born. In other words, for them, 'island' is the minimum condition necessary for reproduction and species' survival.\n\n\nBut these precious birds are now in danger by an ecological disturbance in Marado Island. It's a cat.\n\n\nThe world's notorious ecological disturbance, the cat, is an invasive species believed to have been brought into Marado by humans to fight off rats. These cats have grown in number very quickly through food given by islanders, and as a result, they are causing serious damage to migratory birds visiting the island. For example, Locustella pleskei, which is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list, is reported to be severely damaged by cats in Marado. The same is true of Japanese murrelet.\n\n\nAccording to Marado's Japanese murrelet population viability analysis following the neutralization of street cats, if the maximum number of cats is more than 80, Marado's Japanese murrelets are estimated to be extinct within 20 years.\n\nNevertheless, only the 'TNR' policy was implemented for the cats. TNR stands for Trap-Neuter-Return, literally capturing and castrating cats back into the wild. However, numerous papers have shown that the TNR policy is meaningless in reducing cat populations and does not inhibit the hunting of stray cats.\n\n\nIn addition to feeding street cats, TNR was conducted for three years, and according to the tally in May 2022, there are estimated to be 117 street cats in Marado. These figures are also estimated by non-professional animal rights groups, and the actual number of street cats is likely to be higher. Again, at this rate, Marado's Japanese murrelet is likely to be wiped out in the next 20 years.\n\n\nRecently, due to the influence of YouTube and the bird-watching community, opinions have increased to protect Japanese murrelet. Thanks to him, high-ranking officials in the Republic of Korea were interested in the situation, which led to a meeting on January 31 this year to move the island's cats out of the island. Many bird enthusiasts in Korea were enthusiastic about this, and everything seemed to go smoothly.\n\n\nBut the outcome of the meeting was the opposite of what was expected. In the results of the meeting, it was decided that various experts and animal rights groups would launch a consultative body on February 10th, without anything related to the migration of cats. They claimed that they would come up with cat control measures only after monitoring and collecting opinions from local residents. Control measures, such as migrating cats, should have been implemented before February when the Janese murrelet arrives in Marado, but under the current circumstances, it is not possible to protect the ducks that will be harmed by cats.\n\n\nThe majority of animal rights groups in Korea argue that feeding street cats is ethical, and it is natural to be outdoors. And they believe in the effects of TNR, saying that there is no harm to the ecosystem of street cats. They also make contradictory statements that street cats are good animals because they catch mice and that TNRs do not hunt wild animals.\n\nNumerous animal rights groups and individuals in Korea accuse conservationists of not feeding street cats to preserve wild animals or raising them at home as animal haters. And they hide behind anonymity and bury them socially. They cyberbulled professors and journalists who studied and reported on street cats, and even an animal rights group destroyed motion-sensing cameras installed in the field, disrupting investigations into street cats.\n\n\nHowever, despite their violent behavior, many people and government agencies believe that animal rights groups represent the weak, so there are no sanctions against them. Their influence in Korea is considerable. There is also very little public interest in wildlife. Therefore, the value of conservation of wild birds against cats is easily ignored. Conservationists in Korea have been warning about the adverse effects of street cats on biodiversity for many years, but they have only been stigmatized as animal haters.\n\n\nI wrote this post because I thought I should let foreign countries know about this in this desperate situation. Many of Marado's endangered migratory birds must be preserved. Another purpose of this article is to promote the hypocrisy of animal rights groups in Korea to the world and encourage people to act. If this article is to be worthwhile, it needs to be delivered to more people. Please convey my voice and this message to your friends, family, and major media and wildlife conservation organizations as much as you can. If you love the Earth's ecosystem and animals, please help protect the birds of Marado.\n\n\nPlease.\n\n\n\nI'd appreciate it if you could look at the good materials here.\n\n\nWikipedia's japanese murrelet\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_murrele\n\n\nVideo accusing cats of destroying the ecosystem in South Korea (with English subtitles)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Fg_GAC8ppHs",

        "text": "Hey all,\nI’m a molecular biologist, so this is a little embarrassing to ask. When we sequence a PCR product in my lab, we usually perform PCR then clone the product into PJet and then heat shock the plasmid E.coli so it can be cultured and then we extract and purify the plasmid and send it for Sanger seq. This is a lot of hassle, and I’m curious about why it seems to be much less common to directly sequence the PCR product after extracting it from a gel. \nAny help would be much appreciated",
