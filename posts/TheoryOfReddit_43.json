        "text": "(I'm fairly new to /r/TheoryOfReddit so I apologize if I'm beating a dead horse here. Links to past discussion are appreciated. It's interesting to see what other people have said on the topic in the past.)\n\nSomething the Internet has uniquely brought to the table is the ease with which like-minded individuals can congregate and engage in conversation. This kind of thing existed long before the Internet, but it was never nearly as effective. IRC channels, forums, blogs, and indeed subreddits can be created with little to no cost other than the time it creates to start and run them. In other words, **echo chambers are a dime a dozen**. People generally call this a \"circlejerk\", which is an apt qualification. It's now easier than ever to shut out dissenters while amplifying the voices of those you agree with. This should come as a surprise to nobody. There are countless meta subs for calling out this behavior and putting an end to it, /r/TheoryOfReddit included.\n\n[This topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1sa3fv/an_analysis_of_reddit_and_its_filter_bubbles/) has [been discussed](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ssczi/has_reddit_essentially_become_a_place_for_circle/) many [times before](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2xvx21/a_taxonomy_of_circlejerking/), and I think there is definite credibility to the idea that Reddit is a place you go to when you want to find people who will unconditionally reaffirm whatever opinion you want to share. When you set up a discussion forum, the opinions exchanged within it are going to homogenize over time.^1 I would wager this is how sites like imgur (with at most 2 communities), or 4chan (where communities are allocated exclusively by the admins), have managed to largely sidestep this issue. The more encompassing the community, the more varied the conversations within it are going to be, and the more likely you are to encounter opposition to whatever opinion you feel like sharing. This is why allowing people to create and curate communities at their discretion is a recipe for toxicity.\n\nSince Reddit is such a place, this is not an easy problem to solve. Plenty of communities are built around asserting a particular set of opinions, and there's not much you can do about that. But there are many more communities at Reddit, and indeed the Internet at large, that *aren't* built aroud this, and yet still somehow fall into it. I would argue that it's more dangerous in communities not built around the circlejerk, because it normalizes the discussion as acceptable.^2 For this reason, I think the role of the devil's advocate is more important now than ever before. You don't need to agree with an argument to be able to make sure it's represented fairly. If nobody is going to explain the merits of the counterargument, then it's going to continue to be discredited until it's literally a joke.\n\nReturning to the idea of echo chambers and circlejerks, the problem worsens when people who are used to hearing their own opinions repeated back to them enter a public space like a default sub and have the same thing happen. In a place where echo chambers are a dime a dozen, there are going to be gobs of people with strongly-held opinions ready to viciously agree with themselves in public. Reddit may have the deck stacked against it when it comes to devolving into a circlejerk, but this can be avoided by making sure that the opposition is adequately represented in a respectful way. It doesn't need to win every argument, it just needs to make its presence known.\n\n----\n\n^(1. I feel like this would be a widely-agreed upon conclusion in sociologic circles, but I haven't done the research so I'm only speculating. If anybody has any information on this, your input would be greatly appreciated.)\n\n^(2. For example, if you see a few people go unopposed making racist comments back and forth in /r/GreatApes, you shrug it off as \"just racists being racist\", but if the same thing happens in /r/pics, then it suggests that racist comments are OK there and it's more likely to happen in the future. You may even give some credibility to the ideas yourself. This is obviously an extreme example, but this kind of thing happens in seemingly harmless ways. If somebody in /r/linux mentions that Windows is worthless as a desktop operating system, people there are likely to let the discussion continue, because they either agree or are ambivalent. After a while, this opinion is so public that the mere suggestion that Windows is useful is ridiculed and downvoted into the negatives, and /r/linux has become an anti-Windows circlejerk. I'm not saying any of these things happen, I'm just giving examples of how the lack of dissenters can be almost as much to blame as the opinions themselves.)\n\nEDIT: some formatting nigglings",

        "text": "So recently I linked a comment from a poster in /r/rage to r/bestof. Unsurprisingly, the comments in that original thread were slammed upvotes, downvotes, comments, everything. In short, a massive mess. Within 2 hours, the original comment got downvoted from -200 to -3k. The poster following had a similar ascending scale of upvotes. And then the deleting happened; a mod went through and deleted the comments arbitrarily.\n\nThe end result is that obviously no one could comment or vote. The assumption is that the mod chose to think that the issue was people were brigading the thread. Which brings me to my issue with cross-posts, linking, and subreddits like r/bestof.\n\nSubreddits like /r/bestof do one thing: bring an event in question to the attention of a larger audience within Reddit. Whether the subject is good or bad is irrelevant; the idea is to showcase what an individual might identify as being worth a larger viewing by reddit as a whole.\n\nThe issue, however, is how we as a community are expected to treat posts that are submitted for our viewing. As we all know, new links posted to /r/bestof are set with the *np* option as to prevent people from participating. This seems counterintuitive to how Reddit should function.\n\nReddit, in my opinion, best functions when there is an open and free exchange of ideas. This also means that suppressing others from being able to offer up input in a thread would be in direct conflict with this ideal. This suppression is also in direct conflict with how the karma system works.\n\nIf someone posts an inherently unpopular or disagreed with comment in a particular subreddit, then the community at large responds. If this community pool were to suddenly expand for any reason i.e. going from /r/rage to /r/bestof, then the same rules regarding how the free exchange of ideas and opinions remain in effect. People see how a subject is being treated and respond in kind. Some may offer up an opinion, whereas others may simply vote with how they feel.\n\nThe end result is that the people who get downvoted are downvoted because of the negatively viewed subject they posted.  Upvoted comments reflect the counterpoints presented.\n\nThe question is this: What's difference between Reddit as a community taking a stance on a particular issue and brigading? To me, the two are one in the same, but it also an inherent risk of posting regardless of whether or not it gets posted to /r/bestof, subredditdrama, or even cross-posted somewhere else. People will learn about it and vote / comment accordingly.\n\nOf course, I understand that in some small way, I'm idealizing the nature of Reddit; that we should have a free and open exchange of ideas and concepts, but I believe that this site's design inherently promotes this very notion. And much like real life, we can chose to get involved in regards to what we feel opposed to or stand for. \n\nI'm sure this topic has been probably discussed before, but like any good repost, if you've never seen it, its new to you. I would love to hear feedback on this.",

        "text": "Before I start on this, remember that finding unique, interesting content in search engines is a goal for all companies (I have a blog that I don't have advertising on that I aim to increase traffic from through search engines).  That it will also increase ad revenue is a bonus.\n\nFirstly: Reddit content is often unique, but because of the nature of Reddit's disparate sub-reddit's and the frequent higgledy-piggledy nature of comments within a thread mean that any particular thread is hard to find and searching for a subject invariably will find the post it was linked to or a 3rd party quoting the content.  Remember that great visualisation about people's names ending in 'n'?  That is easy to find in Google.  The thread discussing it?  Difficult to find without being relatively specific in your search.\n\nWith embeddable comments, what essentially happens is that you put a bit of code within the page that has a link through to the original comment and then the original thread onto your page, along with a bit of javascript that loads the comment.  The comment itself is not readable by the search engine robot, so you aren't duplicating content.  What you are doing is creating lots of links back to a thread from related content.  You're giving the search engine another (and stronger) reason to decide that an IAMA page from Tim Berners-Lee is about Tim Berners-Lee because lots of news articles quoting him now link to that page through the embeddable comment (beyond the fact the words 'Tim Berners-Lee' occur on the page).\n\nAnd the beauty of it is that it all happens organically without you having to pay people to beg, borrow or steal links.\n\nAnother side effect (and I'm sure one that the Admin's will deny) is that it allows Reddit to see what else you are looking at on the web so that they can get better segmentation on their advertising (you're logged in with your cookie and the embedded content will be loaded from the same place a normal reddit post will load from).  That way if I wanted to advertise to all the people who look at the Washington Post, I could ask Reddit to only serve adverts on Reddit.com to those people who also saw embedded content on the Washington Post.  This has to be cheaper for me than advertising on the Washington Post, but I'm effectively showing adverts to the same people.  This is what retargetting is.",

        "text": "This is a hard theory of mine to put into words, but I'm going to give it a shot. Over my few years here on Reddit, I've noticed the more generalization in post or opinion, the more likely you'll get agreement. I realize this is a pretty simplistic revelation (as the broader your ideas are, the more people are likely to agree with them), but I find it fascinating how the Reddit userbase can be quasi-manipulated by giving \"specific-generalizations.\"   \n\nI realize that's a complete oxymoron, but I'm not sure how else to define it. I guess the best way would be to give an example:  \n\n*Imagine* **POST A** *is the top voted comment in a given discussion*   \n\n---\n\n**POST A:** The public and private medical system in the United States is a mess. Sick of our politicians fucking this up.   \n\n----\n\nNow what's fascinating is at first glance this seems to be a very \"specific\" point of view. The general structure of these types comments are all over Reddit. But... the reason why they seem so specific is because *we* infer our own viewpoint upon them.   \n\n* A liberal-minded individual would see this comment as calling for more regulation and more government action.  \n\n* A communist might see it suggesting a whole new system be put in place.   \n\n* A republican may infer that Obamacare should be repealed from this comment.   \n\nThe next reply (or top voted reply) to **POST A** is where things become interesting. Nearly every single reply of this nature will narrow the topic but still stay general enough for wide appeal. It will usually *begin to take a stand* on the issue, and at least half of the time (from what I can tell) have an element of comedic value to both obfuscate their actual position (thus edging more appeal) and gain traction over other similar or more serious comments.   \n\nDepending on the topic, **POST B** seems to lean a certain way. In more prosaic or \"neutral\" discussion, it will agree with **POST A.** However, if the issue has some controversy, the post seems to be more challenging of **POST A** but still neutral enough to form a large \"branch\" of conversation.\n\nFor example:  \n\n-----\n\n**POST B:** This. Last week I broke my index finger and I got a $950 emergency room bill. Thanks, Obama. /s\n\n----\n\nFrom there, all subsequent replies (barring comedic or very rare instances) will branch into any number of ideas. Often topics will flow into specific channels of opinion. And, if the OPs of **POST A** or **POST B** continue commenting into these channels, on some they will have huge positive returns, and in others their opinions drop to negative digits.   \n\nThe real turning point is the third post. The third post will either agree with the flow of A &amp; B, or turn the conversation in an unexpected direction or path of disagreement. From there, there seems to be a hodgepodge of subsequent \"third posts\" that go into their own conversation trails. \n\nIt's just so fascinating to me looking at the situation from a broad scale and how the top comments in a thread so expertly channel conversation without people even realizing it.   \n\nI'll try to look for real-reddit examples of this and post them here.  \n\n----\n\nHere are a few examples I've found that follows the general structure I've outlined:  \n[EXAMPLE A](http://i.imgur.com/OPgJ3N5.png)    \n\nGood example of the \"comedic\" second post following the first \"general-specific\" post.  \n\n[EXAMPLE B](http://i.imgur.com/PveLYVY.png)   \n\nIt's *very* easy to impose your own view on the first post. This poster gives a masterful example of a \"top post\" easily yielding to any number subsequent flows.   \n\nThe second post takes the \"hook\" so to speak, and structures the conversation. The final post agreeing with the slanted flow of **POST B** and taking the topic into a further narrow discussion.  \n \n[EXAMPLE C](http://i.imgur.com/XxtOlDv.png)    \n\nThis is the exact opposite of **EXAMPLE B.** The top post takes about as general-specific of a position as one could take, offering little more than simple facts. **POST B** imposes his own view of what the OP means, and the conversation flows from there.   \n\nSo interesting how users assert an opinion onto a post, and that post is often *very* neutral and not actually all that \"specific.\" Just \"general-specific.\"   \n\n\n----\n\n*Disclaimer: In no way am I saying this is a hard and fast rule. Just seems to be a very common trend in many subreddits.*   \n\nEdit: Adding examples and clarifying wording. ",

        "text": "So I'm sure we've all noticed how people often express their opinions as unpopular, even when they're clearly not. Usually they're simply contentious. \n\nSo I've been wondering why this happens, and why it's so ubiquitous. To narrow that question: what rhetorical function does playing the underdog achieve (if any)? What rhetorical function is it intended to achieve? And what has caused it to spread as a meme?\n\nAs to what I mean by playing the underdog: when a poster expresses an opinion which explicitly states or implies that the opinion is unpopular within the venue it's expressed in -- in this case reddit. Clear examples of this can be easily found in a lot of the bigger subs. Lately there has been much talk of social justice issues in such subs, and you find posters claiming that nearly all of reddit is full of \"social justice warriors,\" with others claiming that nearly all of reddit is full of MRAs or some such. \n\nI want to argue that this is less of a rhetorical tool than it is a social one. That is, while playing the underdog may make an argument more persuasive, its primary motive and function is social in nature. \n\nTo explain: a few years ago, when it was fashionable to mock \"hipsters,\" one of things people used to joke about was how hipsters would always tell you they were into obscure music and movies. \"You've probably never heard of them\" was an oft-quoted phrase. We think this sort of thing is mock-worthy because it is a transparent attempt to look cool. The hipster believes that his knowledge of obscure culture places him in a exclusive group, and furthermore he takes pleasure in pointing this out to people. And so when the hipster claims to have some amount of cultural capital due to his association with the obscure music club, we have the reflex to mock him, thereby denying the value of his cultural capital and asserting the value of our own. \n\nI think playing the underdog is the online political discussion equivalent to being the hipster, except more covert. When you claim to hold an unpopular opinion you also claim that if your opinion is righteous, you are more righteous than your peers; if your claim is reasonable you are more reasonable than your peers; and so on and so on. \n\nAs with the hipster, these claims are social claims, insofar as they attempt to situate the speaker in relation to his or her peers. And the social rewards rise in relation to how unpopular the opinion expressed is. It's not enough to claim that 60% or redditers disagree with you -- ideally you'd want to claim that 99% disagree. Like economic capital, the value of social or cultural capital is in its exclusivity. You'd not be claiming much if you said that you were more righteous or rational than only 60% of redditers, but if you were more righteous or rational than 99% your peers, well that's something. \n\nPlaying the underdog, then, is making the claim to belong to an exclusive group, and to thus possess some amount of cultural or social capital through that belonging.\n\nThis explains, I think, why playing the underdog is so ubiquitous, and why it's so often upvoted, even when the claim at underdog status is seriously questionable. Not only is there the impetus for posters to flatter themselves for having the right political opinion, but there's also impetus for anyone who agrees with that opinion to flatter themselves secondhand, by upvoting. \n\nIf I can engage in a bit more armchair sociology and perhaps overconfident speculation, I'd predict that if a poster is socially motivated to hold an opinion in the way described above, they are going to have some interest in seeing that their opinion remains exclusive, i.e., in seeing that not everyone agrees with them. This might sound absurd at first, but if a person believes that holding so-called *unpopular opinion x* makes them part of an exclusive club, and further they revel in the exclusivity of that club (say by constantly playing the underdog), they are going to have some interest in seeing that the exclusivity of that club is protected. \n\nThis could explain why in political discussions, on reddit and off, participants seem to have little interest in actually persuading the other side. Usually it is just a sort of yelling match witch ends with both sides declaring victory and strengthening their own opinions.\n\nThough perhaps this is all bullshit. What do you guys think about taking the role of the underdog?  ",

However, sometimes, a brave soul ventures to go against the narrative, and they are harshly punished with downvotes.\n\nIMO, a vote should require a reply (possibly not on threads), at least 300 characters, with spam detection. \n\nNot that reddit is going to ever implement this. They seem to generally not give a shit about the circlejerk forum this shit place is becoming. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'll either delete my account soon or just never use the comments again. Threads and comments shouldn't be able to be voted on by people who just want to to hide the opposing opinion. Having that on the \"Discussion\" part of the forum is despicable.\n\nNot that this isn't the users' faults, too.

        "text": "I don't use reddit as much as many users, I'm sure, but in my 3 or so years on this website I've seen /r/circlejerk go through a number of permutations, and I can't quite figure out what the community is about. When I first started browsing reddit it was all \"literally so brave\" Ron Paul chaos. Link posts seemed to have been the norm, I'm not sure if the subreddit had ever been text only before. In any case, what I first encountered was pretty insane. It seemed like a 4chan image board or something, just a lot of noise and a small collection of memes, mostly based on Ron Paul, endlessly recycled and re-recycled and filtered through themselves in so many different combinations to the point of madness. Then, suddenly, link posts were disabled and it became satirical. Lightly biting, usually not very funny, but occasionally a post would do really well. In any case, its new purpose seemed to be much more involved with its name in that it actually poked fun at the prevailing reddit circlejerks.\n\nEventually, I remember, fewer and fewer circlejerk posts were showing up. It seemed to wane in both relevance and popularity. Link posts were re-enabled, and it briefly carried on its satire using the infinite resources link posts make available, but it must have devolved back into madness, because I think after a certain period of time link posts were again disabled.\n\n/r/circlejerk seems to be in another strange link post phase. What's all this stuff about Shrek? When was Shrek last mentioned on reddit? What about this James Franco/Jason Segel thing? Did I miss something or is it just some overblown non sequitur? If it's not riffing on a circlejerk that exists outside /r/circlejerk, are they just playing with themselves then?",

        "text": "First topic submitted on this sub! Warning, I've written a lot.\n\nSo, depending on the kind of subreddits you follow around here this might not be something you've come across, but it's something I've noticed on a number of the picture-based subreddits, including one which I run myself.\n\nBasically, there seems to be a particular pattern to what is considered a socially acceptable portrayal of men/women on Reddit. Take /r/OldSchoolCool for example - I was perusing the top posts of all time on there and there definitely seemed to be a pattern to how men and women are portrayed in the *really* popular posts. The women were generally portrayed as either sexy or vulnerable; the highest-ranked picture of a woman (#15) is a bikini girl, and most of the other high-ranked pictures of women follow a similar pattern. There's a gentle-looking picture of Audrey Hepburn at #17, a high school teacher giving off some Lana Kane vibes at #26, a girl in swimwear being carried by a guy at #30 and another having a man hold an umbrella for her at #32, while #35 and #36 are a double whammy of scantily-clad women. What I found particularly interesting was the picture of the first mother in space (#22), which is actually just a close-up of her face, presumably intended to highlight the emotion of the experience.\n\nThe men, by contrast, generally present in fairly traditional \"masculine\" roles. Aside from the aforementioned shots of a guy carrying a woman or holding an umbrella for her, two of the top four posts involve military, one is a man skateboarding in a suit and the other is a man with a gun and cigarette. The #6 post is a male teacher, but it's an interesting contrast to the female teacher at #26; where she's pointing to the blackboard and smiling, he's pointing to the blackboard while standing on a desk, crouched forward as though he were about to pounce on the class. It's a much more unusual, aggressive-looking image.\n\nI've noticed a similar pattern on my own subreddit, /r/fashpics, which deals with fashion photography. It's a small subreddit and I still do the vast majority of the posts, and while the pattern doesn't match /r/OldSchoolCool exactly, it does seem to fall within the realm of \"traditional\" gender roles again. Interestingly, where the most popular posts on /r/OldSchoolCool are predominantly pictures of men, the most popular ones on /r/fashpics are overwhelmingly pictures of women - but then one can argue that fashion is seen as a \"feminine\" interest. The pictures of men which I make a point of including don't necessarily fare *badly* per se - they don't attract a wave of downvotes - but they do seem to struggle to gain traction through upvotes, especially when they portray men in a more sexy, \"feminine\" kind of light.\n\nI don't think it's just men that perpetuate these traditional ideas of men as strong/cool/powerful/dominant and women as fashionable/beautiful/sexy/submissive, either. Case in point is /r/LadyBoners, where 18 of the top 25 posts are of men who have clearly visible facial hair (a quick Google search will bring up lots about how beards or facial hair are perceived as more \"manly\"). One of those 18 posts even has the title \"Beards make men hotter. It's a proven fact\", asserting the idea that more traditionally \"manly\" looks are more attractive on men. However, there are some exceptions in this top 25, such as a female model who works predominantly in men's fashion (#11) and a somewhat homoerotic calendar of French rugby players (#17).\n\nI know there are subreddits that deal specifically with the LGBT community (such as /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow) where a much more diverse spectrum of gender portrayals are encouraged, but I haven't really seen that kind of thing in subreddits that aren't LGBT-specific, which makes me wonder whether it's something that can only really exist in a space that is labelled as LGBT, where it's easier for those who would prefer \"traditional\" gender roles to not look at it or have those roles be questioned.\n\nAnyway, I'm interested in hearing about the experiences of other people on here. Are there other subreddits (particularly popular ones) where you've seen this more traditional portrayal of masculinity and femininity play out? Are there subreddits where you've seen a more mixed portrayal of sexuality, especially ones that aren't proclaimed as LGBT-focused? Do you think there are ways in which more diverse portrayals of gender could be encouraged on Reddit? Is there anything else that you've noticed about the way Reddit as a whole handles ideas of masculinity, femininity, or gender as a whole?",

Whether it be showing your parent or sibling a funny video, tagging a friend somewhere on Facebook, or submitting a link to Reddit, or any link aggregator out there. All these activities are just the sharing of unoriginal content from one individual to another, both of whom had no part in the creation of the shared subject.\n\nIt's the basis of how things go viral, but why does it happen? Why do people care to show entertaining things they've seen to other people? They would just be bonding over something which has nothing to do with them, and will be forgotten very rapidly. What's the psychology behind it? Why does somebody see something and say to themselves, \"this is cool, more people need to see this\", and then send it to a friend or repost it somewhere on the web? What does the submitter gain out of it? Of course I, and everyone is guilty of it, and It feels deep and internal, but I wish it could be explained.\n\nWithout the human need to show other humans stuff they find, link aggregators such as reddit wouldn't exist. How does it keep going when there is no obvious incentive to go to the effort of being a submitter?\n\nPlease disregard reddit karma entirely for this question, that's a different incentive.

        "text": "So recently, I was accused of circlejerking. In the interest of not starting a witchhunt, I'm not going to post where it occurred, but needless to say, I'd be honest to say it's indisputably true. And this got me thinking.\n\nWhat is the nature of my circlejerking? Where do I express it most? Which got me thinking about the nature of circlejerking as a whole. As I see it, there are two overarching groups of circlejerking.\n\n**Serious-jerking** is circlejerking meant to be taken as serious. These jerks tend to be longer and tend to relate to more \"serious\" topics and are just about encouraging echo chamber behavior. **Silly-jerking**, on the other hand, is typically lighthearted and joke-y. Personally, I feel I'm inclined to do a lot more silly-jerking, but I see the gray. So I'd like to make a list of types of -jerks that occur on reddit and welcome any additions.\n\n**Meme-jerking:** These are the jerks that relate specifically to memes both on and off reddit, usually in the form of low-effort comments that hit on a \"dank maymay\" going arond at the time. This can include more low-effort means and things like, \"This is good news for bitcoin\" or \"Actually, it's about ethics in X [journalism].\" *Primary Offenders:* /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/circlejerk, /r/Braveryjerk, /r/jerktalkdiamond. (Almost exclusively sillyjerking)\n\n**Meta-jerking:** Usually related to satirical jerking regarding reddit meta happenings. These often relate to SRS conspiracies, bitcoin, or (lately) cabals. There may be some overlap with both meme-jerking and some serious jerking. *Primary Offenders*: /r/MetaCancerSubDrama, /r/cancerjerk, /r/SubredditDrama. (primarily silly-jernking, but semi-serious at times)\n\n**Social Justice-jerking**: Jerking related to social justice topics of gender, race, identity, and oppression. Often heavily enforced jerking. *Primary Offenders*: /r/ShitRedditSays. (mix of silly-jerking and serious-jerking)\n\n**Anti-Social Justice-Jerking**: Jerking related to disparaging a number of social justice topics. Usually, this uses social justice topics in an absurd way. *Primary Offenders*: /r/SRSsucks, /r/TumblrInAction. (mix of silly-jerking and serious-jerking)\n\nThese are broad categories with many subsets, so feel free to suggest more. As for what can be done to prevent circlejerking...\n\nIn the case of serious-jerking, I see it as a problem. It limits discussion that may be unpopular. I think encouraging people to upvote or downvote based on quality of the comment rather than whether they agree or disagree can be helpful to a point.\n\nFor silly-jerking... I'm obviously biased, but I see little harm in it. It can bring about laughs, and at the end of the day, that's why a lot of people visit reddit. Thoughts on this as well as the post overall?",

It racked up an impressive number of votes in a short amount of time.\n\nI was in and out of the AMA several times, and at one point the total number of votes was well over 10k.\n\nAfter a while of surfing, and as the AMA wound down, I had several tabs open that were opened on different stages of the AMA. Curiously, the newest tab had about a third *less total votes* than my earlier tab.\n\nHere are some screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/gEe9c\n\nUnfortunately, they are not properly timestamped. They are, however, not altered in any way. As you can see from the thread itself, the vote count is now in the 6000s, well under the almost 9000 in the \"early\" screenshot.\n\nI understand the rationale behind the vote fuzzing algorithm. But in cases like this, with huge interest - is this an example of it going awry? From the \"top point\" of over 10k, there's a discrepancy of almost 50% in both *vote count and upvotes*. I find this puzzling.\n\nIt's my first time posting here, so please let me know if this should be altered in any way, or posted elsewhere. I find this community very interesting to follow, and hope to gain some insight into how and why this peculiarity occurred.",

When I checked the Guardian article it turns out it had already been submitted the day before but done extremely poorly (probably due to a bland headline).  However had the OP of the front page post tried to submit the Guardian article with the more eye catching headline he used for his submission rather than submit his new secondary source he wouldn't have been able to.  When you submit the same exact URL to a subreddit it has already been submitted to it simply forwards you to the previous submission rather than allow you to submit it again as new content.  This is easy enough to get around, you simply have to add a ? to the end of the URL and reddit treats it as a new URL entirely so you can resubmit it, but this whole situation got me thinking.  \n\nIdeally the original primary source submission would always make the front page... however reddit doesn't work like that.  When an article is submitted, how eye catching the headline is along with a myriad of other factors (including luck) often decide what makes the front page.  So by discouraging people from resubmitting the same primary source again in an attempt to get it the attention they think the story deserves and forcing them to instead search out a new, usually lower quality, secondary source for the same story in order to submit that instead, it begs the question: Is reddit's internal mechanism to prevent reposts leading to an overall decline in the quality of News sources and inadvertently encouraging blogspam and secondary sources?",
