I wish to get out of this mindset and be happy writing so I can enjoy it more even if I seem destined to not have successes come to me in the screenwriting field.\n\nI’ve been told I don’t want to be a writer I want to “have written” whatever that means I think it means I want the success without the hardship but that’s only partly true.

That there's no bad weather for you? That untouchable feeling that makes other people see your improvement and feel motivated to get better? \n\nI often feel sad or fight about other people's mistakes and when people \"fail\" with me, but in the end I know it's just hitting my head agaisn't the wall and people won't change nor learn by pain, it won't help. I talked to my therapist and finally realized what she always told me. \n\nI decided to focus on myself, stop blaming the world around me, stopped being stubborn and listen to her advice to search what's better for me. Improve my own quality of life, become a stoic Übermensch, an unbreakable person that knows how to deal with situations in life. Like she said, be fully happy with yourself and how you live, so you can start making other people also happy around you. \n\nBecoming great and improving so much that people around you actually want you around, in a vibe that people want to keep up with your step, people feel motivated while you help them, and nothing shakes you because you're so powerful nothing can put you down. The friendly dude that is always ready to help and nothing seems to kill his vibe, the dude that lives in a happy world he built for himself and works as a role model to everyone around. How to improve? \n\nHow do you become that person that's always happy, that infects others with their joy, that puts others at ease just by their presence on the room, that person that feels confortable and you want to be around, that person you see and tell \"gosh, he knows how to live life, I have a lot to learn with that person\".",

I developed a lot of anxiety over the years to the point where talking to strangers became a task in itself.\n\nNow here's my progress:\nIve quit weed a while back\nI got a job that I love\nI started working out\nI made new friends\n\nI'm still not doing well in school but honestly I've stopped caring. One thing I've learned is that while I was happy before I wasn't happy for the right reasons. Everything in my life revolved around pleasing other people which in turn would please me. Thats why it all fell apart when I lost my gf. These days I'm just doing things for me.\n\nThere are still things I need to work on but all in due time. Anxiety is the main one. I've learned to enjoy talking to people again and it's no longer exhausting. Anyway, I'm pretty proud of that. :)",

        "text": "**We are starving for pleasure, but finding it in all the wrong ways.** How often do you feel that life is pointless or  that you’re bored? Think of something that just isn't as good as the real thing. I don’t know what that is for you, but for me that’s probably some food like cheez itz or something. Sometimes the name brand really does beat out off brand, but other times there’s no denying. For us humans, our name brand fuel/driving purpose is revolving creating and influencing. \n\n**We thrive off creating and producing things.** But we’ve traded our ability to create for the apparent luxury of sitting around and doing nothing. Endlessly scrolling, endless media consumption, endless eating… endless sitting… This is what creates a pointless life. It’s almost as if we’ve put on sunglasses 24/7 from what all life can be. We’ve traded our ability to learn, plan, network and collaborate, experience things, take action, the list goes on. We traded all of that in favor of consumption. Seems pretty sad when it’s said like that. But it’s even worse than it sounds. \n\n**Continuing through life with no purpose or no creativity inevitably ends in failure.** Like a car with no gas, it stops moving. Like a person running low on sleep, they start hallucinating. We aren’t meant to function without people and without producing things of value.  And I keep saying producing things as if it’s a tangible item that we’re creating, but it’s far more than that.\n\n**You can create the next cool invention for sure, but you can also create your future or add joy to someone's day.** Nothing will spark more happiness and fulfillment in yourself than helping someone else first. A lot of this comes down to truly knowing yourself and what you excel at in life, what makes you tick. For me though, there is no better joy than helping someone else or sharing something that helps someone in some way. That is a form of producing or creating. It's creating a seed in someone's life, like the seed of joy that may take them further. I wonder what that could be for you. \n\n**If nothing inspires you, if nothing seems truly interesting anymore, it’s time for you to start producing instead of consuming.** The world is fine, it’s your world that's crumbling. Consumer mindset is all around us, man. It’s perfectly fine to do this in proportions, but don’t let your produce to consume ratio get out of whack.",

One was that I forgot to put my alarm yesterday and ended waking up half an hour later than when I wanted to. On top of that, while I was at my work I *thought* I had forgotten my badge to get in so I left the office and disgruntled, I started yelling at myself and physically beating myself up while I was driving, like a fucking psycho. I have a tendency to be late  a lot and I am trying to improve how I calculate my times. That combined with how unproductive I feel sometimes during work, have pressured me to be extra hard on myself.\n\nWhen I realized that I actually did have my fucking badge, you could only realize the nasty things I yelled out in the car to myself. Shit like \"Why the fuck did you make me like this God\" and \"Why can't I just die?\" flooded my mind, followed by more snacks to the head. I honestly feel like a fucking child for doing this and this is not to he first time I have resulted to beating myself up literally and figuratively. I have done that hundreds of times in the past and every time I stop beating myself up physically I think that I have conquered that but then something triggers it again.\n\nI'm planning to go to therapy in the future but I just need a bit more money before I do that. In the meantime, how can I control these feelings?",

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years but just haven't felt like myself in the last few months. Once the breakup happened, everything sort of caved in and I felt like I lost my identity and didn't know how to readjust without him so I sort of fell off the grid, deleted social media, and stopped talking to my friends (which I feel bad about but I've needed).\n\nI just haven't felt good enough to go out or like I can authentically enjoy moments due to the depression but also because I didn't feel good enough about myself. There was just so much negativity during my dark period, that what I was lacking just consumed me and made me feel inadequate. I've actively chosen to fall off the grid and decided I dont want to come back until I get myself back on track and at a better place mentally.\n\nIt's been 2 months and I feel like the darkness is lifting. I feel like shutting myself in from everything really has helped and I've created my own self-help rehabilitation. I finally have a decent-paying job I actually love and feel proud to tell people about. I went off zoloft which I think only worsened my depression and went back to my old meds which seem to help already. I'm rediscovering my passions and enjoying things again...\n\nI feel like I'm slowly coming back to life and back to myself again. I'm not ready to put myself back on the grid yet, but I feel like I'm getting there. I'm not ready to reach back out or see my friends yet, and my doing so makes me feel like a bad person so my one worry is that they will be mad at me.\n\nHave you ever done anything similar for yourself?

The fear of being judged. The fear of coming across as not as smart. The fear of opening up my heart fully and allowing someone in, which would expose me to potential hurt.\n\nBut what that was resulting in was living life only half way. It was half the success in my career. It was half the love I could experience in my personal relationships. It was half the depth in my friendships.\n\nHere's the thing, when we operate from the heart, and when we have the courage to be vulnerable and authentic, we create deeper relationships that are more meaningful, we speak up at work and our ideas actually have the chance of being heard. And most importantly, we create the safe space for others to be vulnerable too, which creates trust and builds lasting professional and personal relationships.",

        "text": " Are you ready to face reality and learn from the mistakes of others? It's true that sometimes men don't realize the weight of their actions until it's too late and all they're left with is regret. A wise man once said, \"I learned from the fools, observing their decision-making process and actions, and avoiding doing the things that led them to trouble.\" To help you avoid making the same mistakes, let's explore seven things other men have regretted in their lives. But, don't just skim through this list - make sure you stick around until the end, because the last one might just be the most valuable lesson of all.\n\n**Number one: Nothing is permanent**\n\nEverything is temporary both the good times and the bad. Have you ever had a really great day, only to have it followed by a really bad one? Or vice versa? It's important to remember that nothing in life is permanent. The good times will eventually come to an end, and the bad times will pass as well. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's what makes life so exciting! The ebb and flow of life keeps things interesting, and it's what helps us appreciate the good times when they come. The key is to learn to appreciate the good times while they last, and to not let the bad times get you down. Imagine you just landed your dream job, but then the company announces layoffs and you lose your job. Instead of dwelling on the bad news and feeling sorry for yourself, try to remember the good times you had while working there, the skills you gained, and the relationships you built. Use that experience to propel you forward in your next job search. On the other hand, imagine you just went through a tough break-up, but then you meet someone new and fall in love. It's important to remember that the bad times will pass, and the good times will come again. The key is to appreciate the present moment and make the most of it.\n\n**Number two: Life doesn't always play by the rules**\n\nLife isn’t Fair and it's up to you to make the most of the cards you were dealt. We've all heard the phrase, \"life isn't fair.\" And it's true. Sometimes, we're dealt a hand that we don't necessarily agree with. But it's up to us to make the most of what we have. Instead of complaining about what we don't have, let's focus on what we do have and make the most of it. Ask yourself, \"how can I make the most of the cards I've been dealt?\" imagine you grew up in a low-income household and didn't have many opportunities. Instead of dwelling on the cards you were dealt, focus on what you do have and make the most of it. Use your hardships as motivation to work harder and achieve your goals.\n\n**Number three:  Not stepping out of your comfort zone**\n\n  \n The biggest risk is taking no risk at all. We often hear that taking risks is a good thing, but it can be scary. But think about it this way: the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risks at all. If you don't take risks, you'll never know what you're capable of. You'll never know what opportunities you might have missed out on. So, next time you're faced with a risky decision, ask yourself, \"what's the worst that could happen?\" And then weigh that against the potential benefits. Imagine you're considering starting your own business, but you're scared of failing. Instead of not taking the risk, weigh the potential benefits and the worst-case scenario. Starting your own business may be risky, but the potential benefits - like being your own boss and having more control over your life - may be worth it.\n\n**Number Four: The importance of being present**  \n   \n Many men tend to dwell in the future or the past, which can be detrimental to living in the present. While it is important to plan for the future and learn from the past, it is crucial not to let them consume your thoughts and actions in the present. Your thoughts about the future should serve as a reminder and direction for your present actions. Similarly, dwelling in the past can prevent you from living in the present and enjoying the present moment. It's important to have a purpose in each day to keep you grounded in the present and not wandering around like a mindless zombie, half the time in the future and the other half in the past.\n\n**Number Fiver: Overthinking: the silent killer of productivity**  \n   \n As we grow older, it's easy to fall into the trap of overthinking. Every little thing can feel like a personal slight, and before you know it, you're spiralling into a vortex of negative thoughts and imagined scenarios. But here's the thing, overthinking is a trap. It's a trap that will slowly eat away at your mental and emotional well-being. It's a trap that will keep you stuck in a cycle of worry and anxiety. So, how do you break free from this trap?\n\nThe answer is simple: action. Action is the antidote to overthinking. When you find yourself getting caught up in your thoughts and emotions, take action. Go for a run, hit the gym, or do some push-ups until failure. Physical activity is a great way to break the cycle of overthinking and refocus your mind on the present moment. It's also a great way to release the pent-up energy that often accompanies overthinking.  \n   \n **Number Six: Don't wait for someone else to make you happy**  \n \n\nTake control of your own happiness with the power of choice. Happiness is not a destination, it's a journey, and it starts with the mindset you choose to adopt. Stop relying on external factors and social media for validation and fulfillment. Learn to find joy in the small things, and appreciate the beauty in every moment. Happiness is a choice, and it's up to you to make it happen, Remember, true happiness comes from within, and it's up to you to make it happen.\n\n**Number Seven: Your Mind is everything**  \n   \n ANOTHER life lesson is that your mind is your best friend and worst enemy. It is important to train your mind to become your best friend, as it will be with you for the rest of your life. Your thinking determines whether you are a winner or a loser. Make sure to become one with your mind and make it your biggest fan and supporter. This is one of the secret traits of all successful men. Remember that life is a gift from God that you need to cherish each and every day. Be sure to incorporate these valuable lessons in your life, which many men only learn later on.",

The only time I'm not laying in bed with baby asleep on my chest (or spending time with hubby) is 1h a day when I workout and take a shower, and after 11 pm that both baby (sleeps through the night) and husband are asleep so I can focus on myself. But staying up late in the middle of the night to get stuff done is no longer sustainable sadly. Any advice or strategies on how to be more productive with baby in my arms? 😹",

        "text": "**Proluge**\n\nIn our modern society, it's likely that as a man growing up you didn't have a masculine role model growing up. In school, most of the teachers are women, and fathers usually work long hours at a corporate job.\n\nNow you’re a grown man and you’re trying to figure your life out. You’re probably not proud of yourself. You probably have a body that you’re not happy with, you might have an addiction to substances and/or consumption of social media and degenerate pornographic content. You likely don't get the attraction you want from the opposite sex. You likely suffer from a cycle of negative thoughts, low levels of confidence and self-esteem, and you struggle to take action.\n\nBut despite your frustrations - you’ve been trying to improve, you’ve been looking for solutions, for help and for guidance. You refuse to end up like another average guy, you've been setting goals and you have an inner drive to succeed. You don't want to be another statistic - you know you are better than that, but you struggle.\n\nIf you resonate with any of that, then you should know - there IS a way out. I’ve been in the same place and I'm going to take you through the process that I took with myself, and hopefully save you some of the frustrations and trial and error that I went through.\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to take action, how to change your life around, how to get rid of addictions and implement new techniques and systems to shape yourself into the man you wish to become. I’ll teach you how to build a strong, aesthetic and capable physique that you are proud of, crucial drills and habits for your mental health (super important) and how to make yourself into a man who attracts women, and gets the respect of men, including yourself.\n\nWhat you should know about me is that I was in the same place in life, and more than 2.5 years ago I made it my purpose to change my life around. I researched the internet endlessly looking for answers, I got into the best shape of my life and I read many books (some of them mentioned in this guide) and tried many things. The change I went through was so meaningful, that I see it as my responsibility to pass it on. I hope to share with you all the lessons I learned as diligently as possible - no BS. \n\nIt's crucial that you read this guide in order. It's okay if you don't finish it in one sequence. I don't want to overwhelm you so I've laid out this guide in a specific order, for reasons that you will soon understand. You will have things to implement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 1 - Discipline\n\n***Taking Action***\n\nDuring our upbringing as men, we are mostly educated by women. Most fathers nowadays are working full-time jobs and long hours, and aren’t always present in a kid’s upbringing. Our teachers at school are usually women. All this usually leads to a lack of a masculine figure in your life growing up.\n\nIn school we are being taught that learning, or studying equals taking action. Don't get me wrong, being studious is a good quality, but it's not the same as taking action. That's probably the reason you’re reading this in the first place - you were taught that LEARNING = TAKING ACTION.\n\nThis leads to a problem solving mechanism in your brain that endlessly consumes without actually acting on any of it.\n\nTaking action is the missing link in all that frustration you have about changing your life. It's likely that you already tried taking action, but it didn't get you where you wanted to be. You probably did go to the gym a few times. You tried approaching a girl a couple times. But maybe you weren't successful, and you quit. \n\nHere’s the thing - taking action is a SKILL. \n\nLets take this on with a videogame analogy. Just like any skill in a video game, you have to gain XP (experience) to level it up. When you drove yourself to take action, it's likely that you took on a Level 10 monster when you were only level 1. \n\nYou must drop the ego, and realize that you are inexperienced, and that you need small wins before you can take on the high level monsters. We need to get you used to taking actions. This needs to be more frequent in your life, instead of something you do only every once in a while.\n\nDuring this guide, I'll give you some **actionable steps** or missions - things that you can do to level up this skill - do them as they are given out. When this happens, stop reading, do whatever it is and then come back to the guide.\n\nWhen they come up, your mind will most likely rationalize that those things don't actually matter and that you're above them - but it's your mind playing tricks on you. And it's this SAME mind that got you to where you are today, which is not where you want to be. Remember that.\n\n*Actionable step 1 - make your bed. I know this sounds silly but we* ***need*** *to get you used to small wins like this. Make your bed 10% nicer. It's not a coincidence that most ‘5am morning routines’ you find online start with this one thing.*\n\n***Motivation Vs. Discipline***\n\nIn our modern society, men are conditioned to be weak. To give in to their every emotion. Even if this is not told outrightly, it's become a cultural norm - we are told to listen to ourselves and to our desires and act them out on a whim. \n\nThis may be another belief that is drilled into us in advertisement, media and consumer culture, or even at school or at home - mostly because the people who are telling us that also have the same beliefs drilled into their minds.   \nModernity taught men to seek comfort, to consume and give in to their every impulse.\n\nHere's the thing - It DOESN’T work. Men are the most miserable when they seek comfort and instant gratification. It's an ultimately boring existence. It’s self-sabotaging. The fact that you are reading this right now is living proof.\n\nMen need purpose. Men need strength, courage, honor, mastery, competence and DISCIPLINE. Just think back to your idols or favorite superheroes growing up, it's likely that the reason they appealed to you so much is involved with at least one of those virtues.\n\nVirtue comes from the word Virtus (latin). Definition -\n\nvirtue\n\nVirtus (Classical Latin: \\[ˈwɪrt̪uːs̠\\]) was **a specific virtue in Ancient Rome**. It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from Latin vir, \"man\"). It was thus a frequently stated virtue of Roman emperors, and was personified as a deity—Virtus.\n\nThe word virtue is defined by the word ‘vir’ (man) from latin. By definition being virtuous is being masculine!\n\nYes, times have changed. In our modern, capitalistic world, personal security is the best it's ever been in history (if you disagree then you are probably consuming too much media and news content) - and absence of basic needs such as food, water and shelter is no longer a reality for the majority of the world’s population - especially in western countries.\n\nIn more primal, ancient times survival WAS a legitimate reality - the only reality. It was also the main motivator for men to take action. Not taking action, usually meant death - which means there was simply no other choice. Taking action was the only option.\n\nIn the absence of a primal motivator for survival in today’s society, men look for motivation elsewhere. In your life, it probably manifests itself in something like motivational youtube videos - more consumption. \n\nNotably, there's a difference between consuming mindless entertainment and actual educational, motivational content. However, the fact remains that there is simply no motivation that can equal the lurking, always present reality/consequence of death in this world. This is just a biological truth.\n\nIn other words, motivation in our modern world is NOT reliable. It's finite. This is probably the reason why you took action in the past, but it didn't stick. If you are waiting around for motivation to hit you in the face and send you to the gym - you won't get anywhere. \n\nSo if we aren’t motivated most of the time, but to make progress we need to take action most of the time that means… Do what you should be doing even when you don’t feel like it. That's **discipline**. I’ll repeat - say it to yourself outloud (If it's not too cringe in your time of reading): \n\n‘Discipline means doing what I should be doing even when I don't feel like it’.\n\nThis simple concept is what differentiates the top 10% of men from the other 90%. It's the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful.\n\n“I don't stop when I'm tired, I stop when I'm done.” - David Goggins.\n\nIt’s important to note - just because it's simple doesn't mean it's easy. If it was easy you wouldn't be having this problem. Being disciplined is HARD. especially when you're only first implementing it. You’re going to struggle and suffer.. Life is suffering. But you are also suffering right now, otherwise you would not be reading this - right?   \n\n\nIf you are going to have to suffer anyways, why not try a different kind? A kind of suffering that doesn't leave you empty, aimless and miserable. The kind of suffering that has been proven time and time again to give meaning, direction and good things to your life. Everything you want is on the other side of the good kind of suffering. It’s up to you.\n\n”We must all suffer from one of two pains:\n\nThe pain of discipline or the pain of regret” -Jim Rohn\n\n“Mental toughness is a lifestyle.” -David Goggins.\n\nLifestyle is not borned. It's built and worked for. Couple the practice of taking the same action with consistency (we'll learn about it in chapter 3 - not what you expect), and you build discipline.\n\n***Rejecting yourself***\n\nFar too many guys reject themselves. They let their limiting beliefs about themselves prevent them from taking action. When in reality, had they taken action, the outcome may have been different. They’re so frightened of rejection, that they end up rejecting themselves!   \n\n\nIf you don't take action, you doom any chance you may have had. Don't limit your potential to your beliefs - give yourself the opportunity for change. You need to put yourself out there and practice vulnerability. You will get rejected and you will fail, but that's where the opportunity for making the necessary conclusions and adjustments lies. \n\nThat's where real growth is. The more you fail, the more you learn, the faster you progress and the better you become. Follow this religiously and see what happens. You have nothing to lose by trying, and everything to lose by not trying.\n\nDon't let this be just another piece of content that you consume and move on with your life.\n\n*Actionable step 2 - Pick up a pen and paper and mention one area of your life where you are currently self-sabotaging by rejecting yourself, and write down how you are going to take action from here on out to change that.*",

You only have one life why the fuck would anyone commit it to do work for most of our lifes when there's no physical limit to what one can do in life? \n\nWe are all fucking slaves here, slaves to fucking money and the governments make sure we stay as fucking slaves by putting taxes on us so it's either \"make money and pay\" or \"lose your freedom and rot in a jail until you learn to obey and pay\"... We are pawns in a fucking game. Fuck this shit. Fuck your society. \n\nI'm quitting ain't doing this slavery shit with an illusion of freedom, fuck the fucking elites and their fucking money.",

        "text": "Im 17 and my friend killed himself a couple months ago. Never would have expected it, he was the funniest person ive ever met. It made me realize that nothing changes, life just remains dull and bad. Gotta love living in the 21st century, where everyone works a job that they don't like for the rest of their lives and never get to do anything they actually want to do! But hey! At least we have a good health system so I can endure this modern lifestyle for 80 years whilst I'm plugged into the wall on a drip.\n\n I swear I've gone through the cycle of getting fitter, joining clubs, and making friends over and over and over. I'm tired of it. Where's the real change? I've moved countries 3 times now. And the fact that even after all of that, life still sucks has to mean something. It just has to. I'm this close to abandoning society and moving to Siberia so I don't have to walk outside and see a group of furries doing a tiktok dance. I'm not going to act depressed when I'm not like a lot of people do, but I'm not going to act like I'm a happy camper. \n\nBut anyways, I finally moved back to my home town in the states after a decade of moving around Europe and each day I'm ridden with anxiety because I have to deal with exhausting people, people with power trips and a dad that I have 0 relationship with. Same ordeal, different country. I feel like I'm moving backwards in life but hey, at least I don't act like some cringe hamza fan boy. Please stop acting like everything in life is some philosophical mission and that you're better than everyone because you read the 48 laws of power. Stop watching core core and listening to duster. It's cringe. Besides that though, I'm extremely grateful to be living a first world life and not be loving in Ukraine or something right now. And i hope that someday I can seek tradition. I mean seriously, what am I meant to do with my life? Am I meant to live a forced lifestyle and open up a microsoft excel sheet everyday for the rest of my life? Is that what is socially acceptable?\n\nEveryone really has been trained to think that this is ok and the ones that don't usually just end up without options. Everyday is the same and it's stupid that this is even a problem for so many of us. Don't get comfortable in the loop but for Pete sake don't act all high and mighty either. I'm trying to leave this lifestyle but I can't even find myself when modernity is constantly breathing down my neck. I'm done. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.",

Why should I floss everyday or wash my face everyday? I just struggle to see a point. I always make sure I smell nice around people or chew gum and wear deodorant, but as long as other people aren’t affected, I find it so hard for me to wash everyday consistently. Actually funnily right now, I am procrastinating my washing. The whole process is just so tiring for me.",

I had a friend (I think) when I first moved to my current location but she ended up moving.

I’m graduating this year and don’t even have one person that I could call a friend. I’ve had some opportunities to make friends but I always seem get nervous and mumble.

        "text": "I'm not looking for pity, and the title may not make much sense to you at first. But when my Grandpa died recently and I went up to see extended family and people that he was very involved with, throughout his life, I had an epiphany. My Grandpa was never as invested in social media, his cell phone, or screens (other than very casual TV), for the majority of his life. This is the kicker, he had a ton of friends that he ate breakfast or drank coffee with every day! He could ride his bike for 15 miles a day until his mid to late 80's, he drove very well even at 88 (I was scared to ride in the car being more mature and knowledgeable 3 years ago), he quit smoking cold turkey 45-50 years ago! But my point is, my Grandpa had a REAL life. He was from a small town and very well respected. I met more people than I could personally keep up with who served with him in the military, at church, or golfed with him every week. He ACTUALLY went outside EVERY DAY and LIVED his life. I feel like we've ALL lost touch. I am in a medium-big city, and the values that we have are \"oh people come and go\". This may seem like I'm bragging. But that is not my intent. Imagine a life for yourself, where you got to live until his age, see your daughter's, grand-daughter's all get married. Meet your great grandkids. See your friends daily. &amp; not be in a retirement home at any point in your life. Obviously, not every one person could be so fortunate. But we focus so much on status nowadays, that we've forgotten how to build our own lives. We have forgotten to appreciate our values in totality and with visceral and vibrant experiences! I mean, maybe I'm generalizing here. But I grew up with a very big heart, have had a very complex life, and have done things that I never would have done if I weren't physically backed into a corner and threatened. While I stick up for myself and stand my ground, I have lost some character and some empathy with these experiences. People are so hung up (even my parents) on money (even when they've made enough to where they are comfortable and can enjoy life) that relationships at all levels are beginning to suffer. I've been very healthy and very unhealthy at different intervals in my life. While I may seem to be getting off track, I am saying, why do we give so much effort to these trivial and new addictive technologies? To people that really do not even know us personally? I have learned that things in life are meant to be experienced. Meant to be ephemeral. Meant to be enjoyed! I was lucky to have had a great life as a skateboarder until I ripped my ligaments. For 16 years, I loved it. I have tasted the highest highs from things like self accomplishment, grit, and just having a straight up love for something. And as time goes on, all of the times I questioned myself whenever I got fucked over by someone else, I actually believe I have been very fair and just in 90% of situations. I question now if I'll ever be successful. Or if I'll ever be able to push myself like I did in skateboarding, in a career. But I know that seeing my Grandpa's life end, has been a huge inspiration to leave social media and other toxic behaviors/people, FAR in the past. I used to think making tens of millions was the only way to be happy. But my Grandpa did it right. I think we all have a lesson to learn from him. And that is to go outside, meet people, be nice to people, be averse to treasonous/unnecessary risk, and BUILD a life you LOVE!",

        "text": "Like the title says, not really looking for solutions or advice, just want to have a place to share my thoughts and basically seek empathy or comfort. I wouldn’t say I’m addicted to porn to where it’s an everyday thing or I can’t function without it but I definitely grew up watching alot of it. About last year I realized it’s not good for me and I wanted to stop. I ended up going on a long 5 to 6 month streak of not watching porn or masturbating. I have a girlfriend, so I was still having intercourse every so often, but at this time I felt a good amount confidence and energy, at least more than I have now. About 2 months ago, I broke the streak, and I was pretty bummed about it. Very discouraged but I picked my head up and tried to start up again. Only a couple days later I folded again. And again a week later. And another time a week after that. To now again yesterday. I’ve made so many broken promises. Those typical “just this last time”. It just feels like I’m going down this downward spiral and I don’t know where the willpower and discipline I had before went. Before, I developed this hatred and despised the thought of porn. The thought of it disgusted me and I would constantly brag about how I defeated it to my friends, and that I’d never turn back. Now I’m actively seeking it again, and I just feel all this shame for saying one thing but doing the opposite. All the times I’ve failed these past weeks I haven’t thought anything of it, knowing I’ll eventually get back to the streak, but this time was different. I felt as if this had a carry over effect to other aspects of my life. I’m a personal trainer for my job, and part of my job is to be confident and have high energy to have a good image for potential clients. Today at work, I had this overwhelming sense of anxiety and depression at work. Co workers could tell i was off, and when we had our weekly meeting and I spoke, my voice was very shaky and I appeared very nervous. It ruined the rest of my day at work, and I didn’t have the energy to talk to anyone. I’m not gonna sit here and say that that was the direct cause of my anxiety, but I’m thinking it definitely played a part. Like I said, I’m not looking for solutions, cuz I already know everyone says the same thing. I’m really just seeking comfort because this is a pretty vulnerable topic to talk about with people I’m close to and I’d rather speak on it with random strangers I know that won’t judge me or know who I am instead of sharing this with people I love.",

I just don’t even know if other people go through this / what to call it / if I should even post it in this subreddit.\n\nI’ve been through a lot of weird and horrible things in my life. And they were caused by people who look like me. People who have the same facial features, skin color, etc. \n\nThough I’m confident in my appearance, I can’t help but literally gag and feel sick when I look in the mirror. When I think about my experiences and the faces of the one who abused me come to my mind, I gag and hate myself because I look like them. \n\nI know that people are more than their physical appearance. And it would be superficial to judge myself by the way I look. But I’m always so disgusted that others will look at me and think that they know the type of person I am because of how I look. \n\nWhen I think of my appearance, I become really introspective and think that I am those people who hurt me. Idk. \n\nI want to mention that I do suffer from psychosis so this feeling could be from that. \n\nI also have a weird thing with empathy. I find myself literally placing myself in the mindset of my abusers to see things from their POV. And once I do that, I notice that I start to struggle with differentiating between what are my own thoughts, feelings and actions and which are those from the abusers. \n\nMaybe I am just looking for some words of encouragement. Idk. I know I am not all of these bad things I believe about myself. But sometimes I feel I can’t escape my meat body. It doesn’t match what I have in my head.",

I’m normally not one for sweets but the way this chewy delight exploded in my mouth, a gushing liquid that smothered my tastebuds, I was literally “hungry for more”. I panned the aisles. Circled back to look again, until I stopped and thought - this is maybe the longest I’d stood in front of the sweets in a long time, maybe since childhood. Then I saw it - myself, sitting watching tv, sweets around me, chewing on this delicious piece, and having done nothing all day, my momentary fantasy of flavour followed by spots, acne on my back for a week, the unhealthy after thoughts like “I feel sick with sugar” “my teeth are coated and rotten” “did I go for that run today?” “How long was I lying there?” “I can’t sleep I’m too buzzed off that high”. I stood up as if a wash of cold water had hit me, I was holding some random sweets in my hands that I had no intention of taking before, I threw it back into the swarm of plastic bags and turned to the opposite aisle - a nice healthy bag of peanuts!",

The last year was the most difficult year in my life, I was so emotionally unstable and was also the year I decided I want to do music with my life. This came with challenges but at least I was happy I knew I would work for this (taking into consideration that I have a producer boyfriend with experience in music) But I didn t thought I was so unstable that my atitudine towards life caused a lot of stress for me. This lead to sensations in my body representing fear, anxiety, tiredness, a very low state and so on. I cried a lot, I was exhausted a lot by consuming energy into fighting with my boyfriend because of the stress we felt within ourselves. Also, we (me and boyfriend) stayed a lot together making music and was hard cause we argued a lot and it was clearly that we werent ok with handling stress.. We have to work on ouserselves.. \n\nI thought last year that 2023 is gonna be a new year and we will take it easy with our dream... But now in January it striked again.. We were stressed and quarreled again... I am tired and feel like I Don t have much time to make music so I have to hurry and I put pressure on myself to be better at a speed pace, while I am so tired....\n\nI don t want to take a break longer than 2 days like.. I want February to come and take it step by step again and with patience... I feel regret cause this month felt like this, such a waste of time... This is why sometimes I do a lot of thoughts rumination finding explanations regarding the fact that nothing changed this month... I can t reverse time and it feels awful, I tend to clean the house excessively (but I promise I won t do it) just because at the beginning of January it was nice for a new beginning and now I feel like I have to do it again for putting things in order into my life...\n\nWhat to do? I Don t have money for therapy, I use my savings for following the path with music... How to continue living this year and healing on the way, recover from exhaustion without regret and without having OCD (both with thoughts and cleaning)? I want to work on myself but I fear that I need much time to heal and will lose time for making music and progressing...",

I have no skills in this life besides packaging boxes and that's everything that I do besides school. I know that I need to learn some high pay skill and I WOULD love to do it and grind my ass off to be a proffesional in it and than become sucesfull, but everything just seems pointless because I don't know where to start. I will go to Uni and eventually get some job, but I can't see myself having a good men lifestyle with job, which I'll get after Uni.\n\nI really like to look on people who are already grinding in their teens, I admire them. For example a lot of teens grind coding, e-commerce to become sucessfull later on. I really wish a had that kind of drive in me right now.\n\nI would like to listen to advice that people can give to me, espsecially men in their 30's who built their life the way they wanted to..\n\nIf it's important, I eat healthy and exercise and probably don't have serious mental health problems.",

I never confronted how I felt and just buried it all down and until very recently that all worked in my favor.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I broke down and told one of my closest friends about everything, the thoughts, the abuse, the attempts, and most of all the actual depression. I won’t lie and say it’s a weight off my shoulders, I feel 200x better, it’s night and day, because that would all be a lie.\n\nI’m still depressed, I still don’t want to be here, but I don’t *want to kill myself*. I’m not trapped with my own mind anymore, I’m finally enough of a man to talk an how I feel.\n\nIf anyone out there is going the same thing as me, please reach out to someone that loves you. It will probably save your life. Hell, I’ll even talk to you if you need someone to.",

        "text": "I regard the aspects of myself that are objectively strong as “average.” Because of this, I become frustrated with others who don’t share my strengths. I know it’s not fair to them, and it’s not healthy for me. I feel I can come across as arrogant or perpetually annoyed when ironically the root of the issue is that I don’t acknowledge or appreciate what I have to offer. I can step back and logically know what my strengths are, but I can’t get it down into my subconscious. Can anyone relate? Any advice?",

        "text": "I think there's a common sentiment of not taking incidents or comments as personal attacks, and if those comments are actually meant to be offensive, you should let go of the feelings and 'forgive' them or accept it with humor. \n\nBut at the same time, things people say about you or how they treat you can be an indicator of your personal flaws or failings. It might be hurtful to grasp but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily untrue. \n\nFor example, if people constantly talk over you in conversations or don't take you seriously or talk shit about you in front of you, it could be an indicator that others don't think you are worthy of respect, either because of the way you put yourself.\n\nIf you take it personally, at least you'll have fuel to improve yourself in many aspects of life, such as going to the gym, being more disciplined, being more social and assertive, so that the people who gave you hard time can't really bring you down like they use to because they don't really have the ammo. \n\nThe only problem is remembering and keeping all the things that are directed to you, bearing that weight alone, while at the same time not try to explode that on anybody all at once, but instead slowly releasing them as strong fuel for your goals. But holding to this stress is about the resiliency of the person more than anything.\n\nI feel like the common sentiment of 'taking it easy' or 'forgiving' makes you more content with your flawed self and subservient of the people who wronged you. It's not like you can have the power to 'forgive' them in the first place at the level you're at. \n\nBut at the same time, holding on to the resentment, and keeping tabs on your wins and losses along the way to your goal can be quite exhausting. Maybe this is just normal for everybody? and I'm just whining about it\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?",
