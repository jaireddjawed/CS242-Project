I am in my last semester of classes.\n\nLuckily, I have all 32 pieces for my literature review, I have my quantitative research questions ready to go (pending approval, of course). The survey will be conducted via Qualtrics, so no interviews.\n\nBut how can I start preparing now, on top of school work? Or should I just go hard in May-August?\n\nI'm afraid that without the structure and sighing of relief from my classes ending, I may be a little bit burnt out and think \"yeah I can do it in a weekend\". Which is dangerous. So any tips?",

I got into the University of Oregon, the University of Utah, NC State, and UC Berkeley (though I think on their 3 year track and not their two year track, but I'm not sure). I have yet to hear back from UPenn, RISD, and UW, but l'm hoping to maybe get into one of those schools as well! I'm trying to determine what would be the best fit for me. My goal is to in the future begin an architecture/real estate development firm and to be able to help create affordable housing. Any info on these programs and how to best prepare for my goals would be super appreciated!\nThanks!!",

To be clear, no one has said anything about my punctuation usage, but as a young woman (of color) who just left undergrad and entered into a doctoral program, I am worried about being perceived in ways that people hold against me negatively, such as being immature or unqualified after reading online that people disregard exclamation points as childish.

        "text": "Hi, everyone. Long story short: I am considering withdrawing from a course. This would result in a W grade on my transcript. Has anyone had experience with this? I’m concerned about whether future employers will view it negatively.  I’m not totally sure if withdrawal is the best way to handle what’s going on, but I want to be informed if that’s going to have to be the ultimate outcome.\n\n\nLong story not short:\nI’m currently enrolled in a project-based course. The professor asked me to take the lead early in the semester, but another person subsequently came onboard as well who has a lot of influence in the department. She has a PhD already, and I believe she’ll be teaching a course for the program next semester. She originally said that she was there to provide support and would follow my lead, but there’s been some tension. She mocked me in our Wednesday meeting and otherwise indicated that she had a problem with how I was handling things. She spoke to the professor about me privately after class. I met with him on Friday fully prepared to hand the reins to her, but he encouraged me to keep at it. He explained some concerns, which seemed fair, and said that he hoped she and I could be better colleagues moving forward. I left feeling optimistic, like I’d been way too worried over nothing. I learned later from another person on the project that she was “gunning for me” and had actually tried to have me removed from the lead. (I get that that’s her prerogative; if she feels like I’m doing a bad job, then she has every right to speak up. I just don’t understand why my meeting with the professor went so well. He’s a nice guy, though, and I get him not wanting to take me out and cause a lot of drama.)\n\nI’m dealing with some health issues, and this is affecting me. I don’t have great treatment options, so I need to be proactive in managing sources of stress. It’s also totally possible that I’m not the person for the job. It’s a great project, and if someone else is a better fit, they have my blessing to take over.\n\nI am concerned that even if I do step down, this team member will remain hostile. I am considering stepping away from the course altogether. This would result in a W grade on my transcript. I do not know whether this course number will be offered again during my time in the program, so it’s possible that the W would remain there permanently. Does anyone know whether this is something that may be concerning to future employers? I have to balance my health right now with the potential for a position in the future. Sorry for writing so much.",

        "text": "I set out on a journey to get a master's degree, but I think that my true intentions are at the root of the problem.  See, I did not feel like my undergrad experience was all that it could have been.  I was not ready for that experience at 17-22 years old.  And because of that, I made a lot of poor choices.  While I have a degree from a top university, I always felt like I could have been more focused and successful.  \n\nFast forward to 2020.  I initially set out to embark on a post-bachelor's degree in accounting.  However, I quickly learned accounting was not something that I wanted to do.  The school counselor's talked me in to getting a Master's program.  They convinced me that it would look better and the credit hours required were half that of a 2nd bachelor's degree.  So I transitioned into a Master's of Finance program.  I began the program in 2022 and have a couple of courses under my belt.  \n\nSince the beginning of this term, which started about 6 weeks ago, I have been wholly unmotivated.  I have had little to no interest in the course content, and the massive writing assignments have become the bane of my existence.  The final project is a 12-15 page essay and I have been incredibly stressed.  I'm not sleeping well.  I feel like I'm wasting my time, because I don't even know that I'll wind up in finance--I'm currently a data analyst.  I chose this degree because I thought it'd showcase my quantitative and analytical abilities.  But my heart is not in it.  I couldn't care less about bank management or financial regulations, etc.  The only thing I found remotely interesting was the focus on present values and future values of money in the first course.  FWIW, I have a 4.0 GPA in the program so far.\n\nI'm afraid to quit for a multitude of reasons.  For one, I feel like it'll make me a failure at yet a 2nd program.  Secondly, I've been using this degree as a crutch, deluding myself into thinking that it's going to open up infinite, lucrative possibilities after I'm done.  But I obviously know that there are no such guarantees.  I'm going to wrap up my final paper here, but I'm not convinced that I'm going to continue on.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts on continuing or not continuing?",

We are both college colleagues and during our internship she began copying my work, later taking credit for it as she did it. After that spreading a bad mouth about me, and she also physically tried to intimate me by pushing me when she walked next to me. Fortunately, I always protected my work, and started creating strategies back in that time such as signing up the materials I prepared, I also tried to just limit communication just by sending emails that formally addressed the work detail in which we were collaborating. I also didn't allow her or gave her space to approach me, by trying to be in places where there were other people who might see her if she portrayed this type of behavior.\n\nToday I went to a college meeting in which she was there as well. I choose to limit any type of contact just by participating in what was necessary. Fortunately, I didn't need to speak to her. Yet I did notice she was trying to look for eye contact and tried to in a way enter a conversation in which I just didn't engage. I did this and act a bit \"indifferent\" or didn't give her attention as a way of limiting contact and protecting myself considering the toxic past behavior. I felt good and strong. Yet in a way, since this is the first time I'm doing this, I wonder if is the correct way of dealing or a healthy type of establishing a boundary.",

This past month I have been working to develop the introduction, literature review, and methodology, but I am still getting there. I was really hoping to have this done by the time I began my travel abroad tomorrow.\n\nThis particular trip abroad wasn't planned for the purpose of being a part of my research or a case study, but it is an opportunity to collect data.\n\nMy research involves drones. I do already know the limits of what I am able to collect (with my drone and what types of data), how I would collect it, when I would collect it, and where I would collect it. All as it would closely relate to my research.\n\nWould it be completely unheard of to use this data as a case study later on? Like collecting it before you have your methodology thoroughly established? Especially in the sense of the data collection not explicitly being guided by specific literature as of yet? Or perhaps the data could be used for interpretation as a case study (guided by literature)? And not necessarily how exactly it was collected.\n\nMy advisor has been pretty rough on my progress so far, so before I ask him If I could possibly use the data later on, I want other opinions or if/how I could build a case for it as I go.\n\nI am in a design program, so there could be flexibility in that sense, but the advisor I got is very rigid in his way of thinking about my master thesis. Worst case I use the data as examples for text in some sections. Or I need to do a the case study when I am back home and things are figured out more. Its just that where I am going is a better place for it (I wont be able to go back).",

        "text": "Short version: I'm thinking about applying for industry jobs and dropping out of my PhD program because I don't love it here. I'm wondering how I might word and frame my application given the situation, and if there's anything ethical I should be aware of in my application. I'm not dead set on dropping out without a solid job offer.\n\nLong context: I'm about a year into my PhD program in the US. My single cohort partner dropped out. None of the professors close to my research interests seem interested in mentoring me, and everyone is stretched thin in this department and/or on sabbatical. Professors won't even provide a drip of feedback on seminar papers. They won't reply when I ask for feedback. I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. All my energy goes into teaching and research projects oriented around teaching, which I love and would be sad to give up. I love my students, but I'm having a hard time connecting it to my research interests. I miss *making* things. My priorities have shifted with age and I'm more interested in providing for my future family.\n\nI happen to have skills in coding and technical writing. Some self-taught, others learned from years of tech-writing teaching experience as well as undergrad. I want to apply for industry jobs for the hell of it and see what happens. I feel like I'm slightly overqualified and would make literally double what I make now at entry-level. Thank you :)",

        "text": " I am an English major who has nearly completed my BS, and I hastily decided to apply for my university's English MA program with the conviction that I would only go if I got the Assistantship (not interested in taking out loans). For those who may be unaware, the Assistantship entails free graduate tuition (plus a stipend) in exchange for working in the Writing Center as well as teaching Freshman Composition. To my delight and horror, I did receive the position.\n\nMy dilemma is this: the MA degree requirement requires 2 years of a foreign language (undergrad credits in addition to my graduate courses) that I would have to pay for out of pocket and complete in addition to taking courses full time and working for the university. I also would likely have to move closer to campus since I currently live far away and do not have a car, and riding the bus/my bike to campus these last few years has been grueling and unsustainable. My funds are low, and I have anxiety about continuing to live in relative poverty for two more years to complete a degree I'm not certain I want or need. I realize there are a lot of benefits to this opportunity, but before I got accepted, I was getting excited about the prospect of leaving academia, joining the working force, and putting my college education to good use.\n\nAny advice about the practicalities surrounding the benefits and drawbacks of going to graduate school would be greatly appreciated, especially personal experiences. Thank you",

        "text": "So, I’ll try to keep the context short. Comment in question is at the bottom. \n\nRecently my PI made an extremely questionable comment to the PhD student in our lab. Some background: this is her first year; she is international, traveling here (US) from India. PI has seemed to dislike her from the beginning and seemed harder on her than anyone else in the lab. I can provide some specific examples if people think it’s relevant. But, the most recent issue at hand, is a matter concerning plagiarism. The student was drafting a lit review, which our PI always has us do in our first year to gather our thoughts about our chosen topic. PI arranged weekly meetings where this student was to present her progress on the review. The first step she was instructed to do was just create a bulleted outline of useful information. The student ended up copying and pasting a lot of things from papers and gov websites into this bulleted list (with citations, but definitely copied and pasted). She then composed roughly 2-3 pages where she used this info, changing words here and there but definitely not sufficiently. Internal and end citations present. She emailed both of these documents to PI, and PI thought the words didn’t sound like her own (this can be obvious since English is obviously not her first language). PI asked the student in person if she plagiarized. Student said no- she definitely has a misguided idea of what constitutes plagiarism. She genuinely believed she did nothing wrong because she included citations and changed some words. PI ran the paper through a plagiarism checker and of course it flagged pretty high for plagiarism (about 70%). Long story short, PI immediately reported the student for academic misconduct and dismissed her as a student, all in the matter of about three days. She did not even wait for the initiation of the university’s investigation. \n\n**Anyway, here is the comment in question: after dismissing the student, student asked PI if there was any other path forward for them besides complete dismissal. PI responded “I am in a difficult position. I have spoken to many other professors on this to get feedback. Most of the white men actually said I was being way too gentle. I see no other path forward.”\n\nThis conversation is recorded (we are in a one party consent state) and I have listened to the recording in its entirety. How the heck would you interpret this comment which came out of left field?? Is she insinuating that the only reason a non white professor would disagree with her on this is because the professor was showing solidarity or something against a fellow non white person?? I really can’t see what else this means.\n\nPI is a white woman if it is relevant to you.",

But I feel like this would pay off in the long run and I'd be much happier.\n\nI'm also confident I'll be able to get a job if I do desperately need it\n\nShould I go ahead with it?\nI intend on improving my physical and mental health which the job wasn't allowing me to do and volunteer at a local NGO I'm in talks with\n\nTLDR: Want to quit shitty job before getting an admit to improve mental and physical health before grad school/future plans",

I admit I've been looking on YouTube for other people's stuff to get an idea. \n\nIt's supposed to be a max of 20 mins. Here are some things I'm thinking: \n\nHow I became interested, my research questions, and a brief talk of primary sources i had access to and how it further shaped my questions. Lightly discuss some of the secondary and how i'm in conversation with them. Pivot into why this is important (the so what), jump into the thesis with a brief summary of each chapter and its importance. Tie it all together again with what this means for today and what we learn ( an even bigger so what)\n\nThen...prepare for the questions.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm posting for my gf who is in a bit of a mess. Long story short, she had a sexual misconduct complaint filed against her with the EOC at her university. However, the complaint was filed a year after she graduated, even though the event occurred while she was still in school. Because it was filed and investigated after she graduated, she has been told that nothing will go on her disciplinary record since she's no longer affiliated with the university. The investigation is not complete, but it is a total he-said she-said case with no real evidence supporting either side. (My gf is innocent and someone basically brought up a ton of false allegations against her, some of which she has evidence to prove her innocence. But again, not much evidence supporting either side, which is probably why the other person never involved police or anything. The only investigation going on is through the university).\n\nMy question is, since this incident won't be put on her disciplinary record at all, will it affect her chances of getting into grad school in any way? The incident report will be documented with the EOC of her university, but that's it. I can provide more details if necessary.",
