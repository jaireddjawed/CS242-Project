        "text": "I am saying this because I struggled with this almost all my life and I have never really managed to conquer this issue fully (particularly the ones involving criticism or anything that makes me uncomfortable and I often shut myself down. Maybe either I am too sensitive or maybe I was exposed to so much criticism throughout my time that it eventually made things worse for me instead of making it better).\n\n\nIn life, you are going to encounter many things that you do not want to see, hear, or encounter - \n\n- dissapointments\n\n- failures\n\n- mistakes\n\n- criticisms\n\n- bullying \n\n- factors that contradict or disprove your own opinions and perspectives\n\n- uncomfortable or hurtful statements or comments\n\n- tough love that nobody wants to hear \n\n- people being better than you\n\n- negative things that yourself that you did not want to hear \n\nAnd I could include so much more. \n\nSometimes I often told myself to have some tough love in my life and told myself to grow up. Sometimes it worked, other times it really didn't and did the opposite (became more destructive and cynical. Eventually I also realised that this kind of tough love was the result of the same kind of tough love that I received from my parents, as in they were emotionally unavailable and did not eventually give the confidence that I desired).\n\nAll of these things are things that everyone would find it hard to face and some would repress them entirely. Sometimes this is a useful coping mechanism to avoid further self-doubt, sometimes it can be very unhealthy to the point that one cannot face anything that involving anything that makes them unhappy, anxious or any other kind of unpleasant behaviour \n\n(of course this mostly depends on the individual because nothing is ever that straight forward either)\n\nEventually, everyone has to face these things while being unmoved by the emotions and feelings that we are exposed to once we face these unpleasant feelings and maybe, these uncomfortable things can be used to our advantage.\n\nSo how can you eventually be able to face these uncomfortable factors and use them to your advantage without being affected in the wrong manner?",

        "text": "This has been something that I struggled to reason with or make a distinction for a long time and the more I look at it, the more I consider that the phenomenon between bravery and cowardice is blurry and mostly subjective which reminds me of [things like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/6g1i7i/then_there_is_real_bravery/) and as much as there is a taboo against cowardice, there is also a taboo or a unconscious pressure to \"force\" people to be brave and inspirational like [disabled people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K9Gg164Bsw) are somehow expected to be [inspirational figures](https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=JDklDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=inspirational+porn+disabled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkw7bL9vbcAhXM-aQKHT5kAwgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inspirational%20porn%20disabled&amp;f=false) (which ironically reinforces that portrayal of [pity towards](https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=wgjnDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=disabled+people+bravery+pity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l-Qv4SzEbT&amp;sig=IYOxYWhpAfgZvbdiUIEKpyK3mfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFgpT69PbcAhVB46QKHbKRB_Q4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=disabled%20people%20bravery%20pity&amp;f=false) these kinds of people )\n\nIn its most simplistic terms, bravery can be regarded as foolishness if not done wisely or done impulsively (like boldly facing a threat because you do not want to be seen as a coward but have little training or have no clue who you are facing and how, or making a protest that eventually turns violent and leads utter chaos and confusion and even more protest that will become even more violent), and in contrast, cowardice can be seen as being cunning or clever (like not facing a threat or an anxious stimulus in order to fight for another day, or using more cunning tactics like using deception in a fight. This usually means that the person lacks honour, therefore, that said person is called a coward)\n\nSometimes, those who are often brave can be seen as foolish but still pretty brave like continuing  to face the adversity even if the odds are not in their favour. Other times, learning to stop fighting or quitting can be seen as being smart like the term [\"surrender to win\"](https://anaheimlighthouse.com/blog/why-surrender-to-win-seems-like-a-contradiction/) or winning by quitting seems contradictory but useful for those who have addiction problems.\n\nWhen can we define as \"brave\" if you wish to be [victorious without fighting](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/48711-supreme-excellence-consists-of-breaking-the-enemy-s-resistance-without-fighting) or [without conflict](https://www.taoistic.com/taoteching-laotzu/taoteching-68.htm); or when can we define as \"cowardice\" for not wanting to fight like in the [first World War](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/27/first-world-war-bravery-fight-for-peace) acts for bravery were for those who wanted to fight instead of those who did not want to fight [like in the Christmas truce of 1914, not everyone saw it as a positive event. In fact, it was quite the opposite for some](https://www.solosophie.com/wwi-propaganda-and-christmas-truce-1914/)\n\n\n\n",

I live in a abnormally quiet home, I play all my video games on mute and wear discreet full-blocking earplugs when going outside. . A lot of young people my age are around blasting music til their ears bleed but here I am forcing myself to be quiet.\n\nAs you probably know, literally everywhere public you go is blasted with music, televisions and/or radio. There is just no safe spot for us suffering from sensory processing issues. Even now on the internet, video essays and podcasts are now the main content to consume. Long gone are the days that we read books and rely on text. It gets me sick in the stomach every time I see a video essay of a topic that interests me but unable to listen to the commentary. Being an avid gamer, it is 1000x harder to find quality text-based content.\n\nI’m kinda concerned, albeit scared that people are just really not understanding with the 1 in 100 people being autistic, most suffering from some kind of sensory problem. Also take into account with conditions such as misophonia, that greatly affects functioning in a society with so much noise.\n\nAnother thing I find disgusting is the advertising industry and the manipulative, purposely disruptive conditioning corporations use. But that’s for another time.\n\nI am quite passionate about this subject and also prospecting to be an activist. I am curious if others feel the same way about the world as we know in this day and age being too “loud” and sound dependent. Do you suffer from some sort of sensory processing disorder? What would you propose to help us take care of those who need quiet? Would you be happy for a shopping mall to turn off all media for an hour a day? Is it worth it?\n\nThe big question is, do we as humans need some quiet once in a while that we don’t get at all?",

Why can't a fixed monthly salary even for owners of company that is proportionate to positive responses recieved from the customers be the motivation to compete and perform better?\n\nPlease don't downvote it by calling it communism. I am just curious and want to make this world a fair place.",

However, scientists don't have the incentive to do these, their incentive is to get their publication accepted by high quality journals.\n\nThe journal, in turn, have an incentive to get as high impact factor as possible i.e. get as much citation as possible. To get a lot of citation, journals prefer revolutionary ideas / findings, even if the methodology is poor. A preference towards false positive. This means that replication studies and negative findings are not very lucrative for journals.\n\nMy question is, why don't people cite replication studies and negative findings? If they do, then journals will want to publish these, too making science healthier as a whole?",

It has its own vernacular, code of conduct and the behaviours we develop are also internet bound and sometimes even bound by the subreddit we are on.\n\nSo this raises a question. Did this internet culture start as American culture that was modified overtime? Did some other country have a greater impact on our internet culture (Russian conspiracy anyone?). \n\nOr is the internet culture uniquely its own thing that emerged from the interactions of multiple people of multiple backgrounds and cultures that mixed and were bound by the medium itself. If the \"medium is the message \" perhaps the medium of the internet was what caused this culture to emerge. More and more we see internet culture influence the way we interact IRL so my vote is for this latter proposition.\n\nBut I'm curious to see if anyone can make a case that internet culture is still fundamentally American ( or other culture )",
